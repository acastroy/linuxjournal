Create a community site with an article queue, comments, user blogs
and more.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2947580.0x2a3f3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Over the last few months, we've been looking at content management
software (CMS) that makes it easy to create Weblogs, personal journals
that continue to grow in popularity and influence. There are no
hard-and-fast rules as to what constitutes a Weblog (or blog), but
most people probably would agree that the contents typically are short
articles, with the newest ones displayed first.
</p><p>
But there is a larger, slightly different, class of Weblogs out there
as well, which probably can be called Slashdot-style, for lack of a
better term. These Weblogs are edited by a small group of people but
have a large number of contributors. In many ways, these are closer
to on-line forums or bulletin boards than to Weblogs. However, such
software also provides Weblog capabilities for its individual members.
That is, a visitor to the site can read the main discussion,
create his or her own Weblog and read through other users'
Weblogs as well.
</p><p>
Although some packages&mdash;most notably Slash, which powers
Slashdot, use.perl.org and some other high-profile sites&mdash;were
designed around the idea of public and private Weblogs, other packages
have grown to incorporate this idea. One such package is XOOPS, which
supposedly stands for Extended Object Oriented Portal System. XOOPS is an
outgrowth of the PHPNuke and PostNuke family of portal servers.
</p><p>
This month, we look at XOOPS, paying particular attention at
WeBLog (pronounced Wee-Bee-Log), a module designed to facilitate the
creation and administration of public and private Weblogs. I
have reservations about XOOPS, but it can be an excellent tool for a
certain type of audience. In particular, the ease with which it
can be installed and administered, and with which each user can be
granted his or her own Weblog, is hard to beat.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2947580.0x2a3f5b0"></a>
History</h2></div></div><p>
XOOPS testifies to the power of the GNU General Public License, to the
Open Source community and to the fact that not all forks or
splits in an open-source project are bad. The XOOPS story begins
with PHPNuke, a suite of programs written in PHP and using MySQL for
its database back end. PHPNuke apparently
was built on top of ThatWare, a now-abandoned Slash clone written in
PHP.
</p><p>
What happened next is controversial, to say the least, and
demonstrates what can happen when an open-source project gets ugly: a
large number of PHPNuke contributors decided to fork the project and
named their version PostNuke.
Today, PHPNuke and PostNuke both exist, and little love is lost
between the user and development communities. From what I can tell,
and without examining the code in any depth, PHPNuke mainly
continues to be developed by Francisco Burzi, with the main criticisms having to
do with his management style, the hobbyist orientation of PHPNuke
modules and issues having to do with security. Although PostNuke is
quite popular and seems to have the edge on security,
administration, commercial-oriented modules and
database-independence, maintainers are accused of changing APIs too
frequently and of designing PostNuke to be too resource-intensive.
Meanwhile, some of the central PostNuke developers have left that
project, forking it into software that originally was known as
LostNuke and now goes by the name of Xaraya.
</p><p>
Finally, XOOPS seems (from what I can tell) to be an object-oriented
rewrite of PHPNuke. The XOOPS maintainers believe that by rewriting
the system to use objects, it is more secure and easier to
develop and maintain.
</p><p>
The good news is that all of these systems are available under the GNU
General Public License.
That said,
forks generally are seen as a last resort in the Open Source
community&mdash;and the fact that so many have happened on this software probably
testifies to the lack of strong management and leadership of these
projects. Reviewing the history of these projects renewed my
admiration for people like Linus Torvalds, Larry Wall and Guido von
Rossum, all of whom have managed to keep their communities together,
despite differences of opinion among the core developers.
</p><p>
XOOPS seems to have a smaller community than either PHPNuke or
PostNuke. However, the number of built-in and third-party modules is
quite large, and its object-oriented facilities mean it is fairly
easy to build your own module. Indeed, although the number of
modules has remained fairly modest, I was impressed by how easy it was
to install. Does this mean you should use XOOPS over another one
of the Nuke-alikes? That seems to depend as much on politics and your
planned use as on the technology itself, although the fact that XOOPS uses objects
does give it an edge, at least in theory, from my experience.

Downloading and Installing</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we have reviewed the historical evolution of XOOPS and
related pieces of software, let's set up our own XOOPS server. In
order to run XOOPS, you need a MySQL server&mdash;I am running the
admittedly old version of 3.23.58 on my workstation&mdash;and a copy of
Apache (version 1 or 2) with PHP installed.
</p><p>
Installing XOOPS is one of the most impressive and painless software
installs I have done in a long time. I downloaded the code from
the XOOPS Web site (see the on-line Resources section) and opened up the .tar.gz file in a temporary directory. I
then copied the entire HTML subdirectory into my Apache content
root, as /usr/local/apache/html/xoops. Once I had done that, I was
able to access the XOOPS installer at the URL /xoops on my system.
</p><p>
The installer is fully Web-based and walks you through the process
slowly but surely. The most confusing part probably was the page on
which you need to enter the user name and password of a MySQL user who
is authorized to create a new database and tables. The installer
also could be a bit more verbose in its error messages at this initial
phase, given that many people installing XOOPS are unlikely to be
experienced Web/database programmers.
</p><p>
That said, the installation was fairly simple and painless. I
returned to the /xoops URL on my system and was greeted with a simple
introductory screen that invited me to log in. I logged in as the
site administrator, and although the main screen was relatively
blank, I was able to move quickly to the Administration menu on the
left side of the screen (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7460f1.large.jpg"><img src="7460f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1.
The XOOPS site administration page is where you select the modules
you want to appear on your site.
</p></div></div><p>
Administering XOOPS is fairly straightforward, once you understand
that everything in XOOPS is a module. The first order of business for
most XOOPS administrators then is to install additional modules.
Go to the Administration menu and choose Modules. The top of the
screen lists the modules already installed, and the
bottom of the screen lists those available but uninistalled.
</p><p>
To install an available module, click on the appropriate icon
next to the module's name. After you
confirm your choice, you should see an indication of which tables are
being created in the MySQL database, what access permissions have been
added to the system and whether the module was installed correctly.
Assuming that it was, you can return to the Module Administration
page, where you should see the newly installed module at the top of the
screen rather than at the bottom.
</p><p>
The default layout of a XOOPS site is rather empty. To include
additional items on the home page, you must go to the Blocks
administrative page, which lists the content features each module
includes. The News module includes three blocks&mdash;bigstory,
topics and top. The main Blocks Administration menu lets the
site manager indicate which blocks are visible. But the real power
happens in the Edit menu associated with each block, allowing you to
indicate where on the screen the block should appear&mdash;on the side, in
the center or somewhere else entirely.

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2947580.0x2a3ff50"></a>
Modules</h2></div></div><p>
Each XOOPS module packages together HTML, PHP and SQL into a defined
list of directories that is consistent across modules. For example,
you can always expect to find class definitions in the class
directory, database definitions in the SQL directory, blocks in the
blocks directory and images in the images directory.
Configuration and version information is always in a xoops_version.php
file in the module's root directory.
</p><p>
Installing a new module is as easy as downloading it and placing its
top-level directory in the modules directory. So, if you download
module foo from the Internet, and if your XOOPS directory is
/usr/local/apache/html/xoops, you simply can move the foo directory
to /usr/local/apache/html/xoops/modules. The next time you visit
the Module Administration page, the module is there, ready for
you to install and configure it.
</p><p>
One important issue the XOOPS developers have kept in mind is
that of database upgrades. It is easy to imagine how the PHP and HTML
portions of a XOOPS module would be upgraded. Upgrading a module that
combines PHP with SQL is a tougher nut to crack, and it seems as
though the XOOPS people have done an admirable job. The SQL
directory in a XOOPS module may contain not only a mysql.sql file
with MySQL definitions but also update files with ALTER TABLE
commands that change the table definitions from one version to the
next. Because each module's tables are insulated from the rest of the
system, you should be able to upgrade XOOPS modules independently of
one another and in nearly any order.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2947580.0x2a40108"></a>
WeBLog</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we have gotten a taste of how to work with XOOPS modules, we
are going to install the WeBLog module, written by Hiroyuki Sakai. This
not only gives us a chance to download and install a third-party XOOPS
module, but it also provides the functionality we
originally were searching for, namely a Weblog system that is good for
a community of users.
</p><p>
To install WeBLog, download the file from the main site (see Resources). As with most XOOPS modules, you should
unpack it with <tt  >tar zxf</tt>, and then copy or move the top-level
weblog directory into your XOOPS modules directory. On my system,
WeBLog was installed as
/usr/local/apache/html/xoops/modules/weblog.
</p><p>
To install the module, simply go to the Module Administration page
and click on install. You now can create and administer
Weblogs of various sorts. The Module Administration page
displays a new Weblog icon on the left side, allowing you to set
permissions (which users are allowed to create and post to
Weblogs), categories and even perform some basic database
maintenance.
</p><p>
Now that you have made it possible to create a Weblog, return to your
site's home page. You should see a WeBLog menu option on the left
side of the screen with a collection of the most recent items from all
of the Weblogs on the system. If this is your first time running the
module, this page is mostly empty. You can create or modify
your own Weblog by clicking on My WeBLog. Enter your posting in the
appropriate parts of the HTML form, inserting at least 75 characters,
unless you have changed this option in the Preferences
Administration page. Once you have posted your new Weblog entry, you
can view it by returning to the WeBLog menu item. That global viewing
screen collects all of the individual Weblogs, but it also allows you
to click on a user's name and view only his or her Weblog.
</p><p>
WeBLog provides a number of other useful features, ranging from
RSS syndication to searchable and browseable archives, to the ability
to comment on a posting. You also can ask to be notified when a new
posting is added. Such notifications are placed in the XOOPS message
system and are flagged on the main menu when you enter the site.

Should You Use XOOPS?</h2></div></div><p>
If you want to create an on-line community of people with Weblogs, you
could do much worse than XOOPS. It is supported by an active
development community, and the WeBLog module appears to be stable and well
maintained. Furthermore, the technology is simple and straightforward enough
that those with Web/database experience should be able to modify and
maintain the system on their own.
</p><p>
As I explored XOOPS, however, I could not help but compare it with OpenACS,
another community-oriented Web system that has a Weblogs module. Is
there any reason why someone would prefer to work with XOOPS rather
than OpenACS, which arguably is technically superior?
</p><p>
As much as I love OpenACS, the answer is a firm yes. OpenACS is a
great system when hard-core Web/database hackers are around, when
you have root access to your own server and when you can turn the
OpenACS toolkit into a workable customized solution for your needs.
But many people and projects don't have the resources or the budget for
such high-powered expertise; they are looking to accomplish things
quickly and easily on a shared server that provides access to PHP and
MySQL.
For such people, XOOPS may be just the ticket. It lacks a number of
features I would like to see, but it can be installed
anywhere, maintained by the large community of PHP/MySQL
programmers and administered by non-programmers with a minimum
of training. It doesn't have many features I would expect in a
more sophisticated system, such as Unicode support, multiple instances
of a single package, content versioning and hierarchical groups. But
it does do a good job for what it was intended to do, and
the community of XOOPS users seems ready to help anyone who has issues
and problems.
</p><p>
I find it hard to classify XOOPS as a content management system in
the traditional sense, despite what the package maintainers claim.
Yes, it allows you to post news articles and to have those approved
by a site administrator before they go live. But I think XOOPS
is better thought of as an easy-to-use community system that makes it
simple to create Weblogs and other standardized content. For many
people, that is more than enough, and the ease with which they can
create relatively sophisticated sites outweighs the other
considerations.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2947580.0x2a40790"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
XOOPS is definitely not for everyone&mdash;the politics, the
object-oriented code and the lack of certain features I
consider vital make me think twice about recommending it. But I
also have seen the time and effort it takes to
get up to speed on such technologies as Zope and OpenACS, and the
trade-off has not always been worthwhile. If you are an expert in PHP
and MySQL, and you are looking to create a community site with good
Weblog facilities, you might do well to consider XOOPS.
