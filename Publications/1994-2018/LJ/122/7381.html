An international standard law will help your
free software license work the same in all your users' countries.

Free software licenses function in a number of
different ways. First, they are a statement of rules
about what free software programmers can and cannot
do within their own communities. Part
of the reason for complying with these conditions
is the power of reputational capital: there is an
incentive to play the game by the recognised rules,
whether formal or informal, written or understood. The
licenses also bind in a legal way because they are built on
copyright and licensing or contract law. Copyright
protects authors' original creations by allowing
them to prevent access to their work; software
licenses permit access to such works, under certain
conditions. When the licenses are proprietary, what
the user can do with the work is quite restricted,
whereas free software licenses allow different
degrees of freedom. Some, such as the BSD licenses,
have practically no requirement to give anything
back. Others, such as the GNU GPL, place strong
obligations on authors when software is modified and published.
</p><p>
The law governing software licensing appears straightforward, but it is not.
Contract law varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, as does copyright.
A law drafted in one legal system may not bind in another. Therefore,
ideally speaking, some international standardisation of law in this
area should be in place to make sure rules that bind in one country do
likewise in another.
</p><p>
This point was made clear to me when I began studying
this area of law from a socio-legal perspective some
years ago. I believed that free software legislation
was something that programmers involved in this
line of work should seek. I started work with the
Free Software Consortium (FSC) during the summer
of 2003 and was appointed as coordinator of their
Legal Governing Body. In Costa Rica last September, I
commenced a project to draft free software legislation
with a view to getting it passed by legislatures
around the world. The project is in its infancy but
is maturing rapidly.
</p><p>
My early take on the matter was that because the GNU GPL was the most commonly
used license among free software developers, the law should be put in
place to protect this scheme. Draft 1 of the Free Software Act attempted
to enshrine its terms and added a few more, such as protection for
any programmers who inadvertently infringed a copyright. This latter
point would preempt any recurrence of vexatious lawsuits, such as the
current SCO
vs. IBM case. I quickly was put right, however, by colleagues in the FSC
and by Richard Stallman himself, who advised me that such legislation
should not seek to copyleft all free software but, rather, should
endeavour to grant legislative force to all free software licenses.
Draft 2 was an improvement on the first draft but still appeared to
copyleft all free software. I began work on Draft 3 after Christmas 2003,
and it recently was completed. I currently am working on Draft 4, which
I hope will hit the mark more closely. Once completed, Draft 4 will be
available on the FSC Web site, as are the earlier versions.
</p><p>
My idea about this project is to make it a venture of the Free Software
community as a whole. The worst types of law are those that disrupt
beneficial and functioning social contracts, such as the introduction
of copyright law to cover software when previously it had been a shared
resource. Lawyers have to respond to social movements and change.
They should take part in such movements and share such drafting
activities, so they become linguistic facilitators of communities' customs
and wishes, rather than interlopers who enter the fray
and disrupt it.
</p><p>
This project continues to be a learning experience for me. Initially,
I saw value in protecting only the copyleft system, as it is the
most common one, makes the most demands and potentially
is most vulnerable in the eyes of the law. Other considerations
need to be taken into account, however. Such a law would prove divisive
if it protects only one, albeit the majority, view. It would be
preferable, indeed, to have an international law that gives protection
to all free software licenses. This would mean any clashes between
the license and the contract or copyright law of the particular country
in which the case is being tried would be irrelevant: the legislation
would act to bind third parties and would ensure that rights recognised
in one place would be recognised similarly in another.
</p><p>
At the time of this writing, Draft 3 is the most recent version of the Act, and it can be viewed on
the FSC Web site at <a href="http://www.fsc.cc" target="_self">www.fsc.cc</a>. Comments are
welcome, and participants to the FSAct mailing list at
<a href="mailto:Fsact@lists.fsc.cc">Fsact@lists.fsc.cc</a> are
encouraged. Alternatively, you can e-mail me at
