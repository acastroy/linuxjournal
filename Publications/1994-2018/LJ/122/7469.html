Two US presidential campaigns made a big
stir by using the Internet as a two-way medium.
The innovators got clobbered by Big Television this
time, but the software is open source and ready for
the next round.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xda0580.0xe98298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In July 2002, Lawrence Lessig gave a speech
that challenged technologists to become politically active, to take up the
fight against forces determined to replace the Net's free and open
commons with a plumbing system for content, valved at every juncture
by mechanisms made to manage the digital
rights of industrial
producers. He didn't pull punches:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Now, I've spent two years talking to you. To us. About this. And
we've not done anything yet. A lot of energy building sites and
blogs and Slashdot stories. [But] nothing yet to change that vision
in Washington. Because we hate Washington, right? Who would waste
his time in Washington?
</p><p>
But if you don't do something now, this freedom that you built, that
you spend your life coding, this freedom will be taken away. Either
by those who see you as a threat, who then invoke the system of law
we call patents, or by those who take advantage of the extraordinary
expansion of control that the law of copyright now gives them over
innovation. Either of these two changes through law will produce a
world where your freedom has been taken away. And, if you can't
fight for your freedom, you don't deserve it.
</p><p>
But you've done nothing.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Larry was right. Against the RIAA, the MPAA, the
big publishing and broadcasting lobbies and Congress
itself, the good guys were being trounced, repeatedly.
</p><p>
So let's mark that point in time and fast-forward to December 2003,
17 months later. The presidential primary playoffs are about to
begin, and already a Democratic frontrunner has not been chosen on the
strength of his appeal but through the Internet and a variety of tools that
run on the Net.
</p><p>
In an interview with Christopher Lydon, Larry said this:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We're just at the moment when people realize that culture is not
something that has to be fed to them, like the Soviet citizens at
the end of the Soviet empire, where they realize that they can
participate in the construction and sharing of culture. Technology
has given us that opportunity. And the problem now is that the law
takes that away. And so Creative Commons' objective is to find a way
to get the law out of the way, so this extraordinary potential for
human creativity can be realized in the context of this
technology....What we want to do is make it easy for people to
recognize the free culture that is out there for them to build upon,
so that they'll build on that culture.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The &ldquo;we&rdquo; in this case isn't only Creative Commons. It's something new
yet familiar: the free culture movement. &ldquo;Just as Richard Stallman gave
birth to the free software movement&rdquo;, Larry said, &ldquo;I think it's fair to
say we're the free software movement for culture.&rdquo;
And, much like Richard, Larry is quick to make distinctions:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
There is an important difference between the free software movement
and the open-source software movement, in that the free software
movement's first goal is freedom. It's not promising better
software. It's not promising a better business model. It's promising
freedom. And I think that's what the free culture movement is about.
It's about giving people the freedom to build and cultivate their
culture.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
As with free software, tools matter. &ldquo;One of the most important
examples&rdquo; of free culture tools, Larry says, is the Weblog:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Free culture is about the transformation between a broadcast culture
and a procreative culture&mdash;from a broadcast culture where the few
speak to the many to a procreative culture where the many speak to
the many. That's what the Internet is supposed to have been about
forever. But blogging is the first time that it happens in the
context of political ideas that get translated and expanded upon as
other people comment on them. In the context of political
campaigns...they become better citizens. They become engaged
citizens. There has been no new technology in the last 150 years
that has produced more engaged citizens.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Larry said all this in late 2003, when Howard Dean
had emerged as the leading Democratic candidate
for president. During the 2003 calendar year,
the Net-centric Dean campaign started from nowhere,
raised record sums of money, involved record numbers
of people and made its candidate a frontrunner in
the polls as well as the purse. When it was over,
and John Kerry ran away with the Democratic party
nomination, the mainstream press predictably compared
the Dean campaign to the dot-com bubble. Joe Trippi,
Dean's campaign manager,
voiced what everybody who truly watched the
campaign or participated in it knew intimately:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
This was not a dot-com crash. The Howard Dean campaign was a dot-com
miracle. Let's look at this thing. This guy starts...on January 31
of last year with seven people, $157,000 in the bank, 432 known
supporters nationwide....He was an asterisk....How did it happen?
It is a miracle that Howard Dean moved from there to $45 million,
more money than any Democrat in history has raised....He didn't do
it. I didn't do it. You did it.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Politics, Trippi said, was no longer something mediated by the media, no
longer a horse race run and covered exclusively by professionals. It
was, Trippi said, the end of an era that began with the televised
Kennedy-Nixon debate in 1960:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
It took about five to ten years to realize that was the moment when
television was going to change everything in America's politics.
What no one could've predicted was that it would have become a race
for money, a race to buy a one-way communications tool that would
take the American people essentially out of the process. It was no
longer about average Americans, it was about, &ldquo;How do I find a rich
guy to write me a $2,000 check and then how do I take that money and
buy television with it?&rdquo;
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Joe Trippi said all this on February 11, 2004, in his keynote address to
the Digital Democracy Teach-In, an event that opened O'Reilly's Emerging
Technology Conference. That event was an idea I suggested
to the O'Reilly folks at the end of the company's Open Source Convention
in July 2003. It also was my idea to invite Joe Trippi to keynote the
thing. That idea came to me while Britt Blaser, founder of xpertweb.com
and an energetic Dean volunteer, was giving me a tour of
the Dean Campaign headquarters in Burlington, Vermont. I was present in
purely electronic form. My face was on Britt's laptop, my voice was on
his laptop speakers and my eye was a camera mounted on the laptop lid.
My body was in California. It was in this disembodied form that I met
Joe. Walking around holding the laptop like an hors d'oeuvre tray at a
party, Britt ran into Joe in the hallway. After saying hi, I asked Joe
to keynote the February event. To my astonishment, he said yes.

A Long Strange Trip</h2></div></div><p>
My own involvement in this story, however, began more than a year
earlier, on June 26, 2002, at the New York launch of eThePeople.org,
a &ldquo;public forum for a new democracy
conversation&rdquo;. I was the featured speaker, recruited for having coined
the phrase &ldquo;markets are conversations,&rdquo; which was the opening thesis of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cluetrain Manifesto</em></span> and an inspiration for eThePeople's statement of
purpose. Here's how that goes:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Democracy is a conversation. It's a dialogue that includes
politicians, interest groups, parties, journalists, lobbyists,
pollsters, letter-writers, campaign contributors, protesters and
voters. It's an ongoing negotiation about how our priorities and our
values should translate into public policy.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
eThePeople built their site on Linux. So did Scott
Heiferman, founder of MeetUp, which was launched
just 12 days earlier. Scott was there for the
party and to let me know about MeetUp's Linux
foundations. MeetUp went on to become the most
important commercial accessory to democracy since
the tavern. More than 165,000 people joined MeetUps
for Howard Dean alone.
</p><p>
Britt called me so often from Dean Campaign
headquarters in Vermont that I felt like I personally
knew everybody there. Some of them knew me first,
however, because the campaign consciously borrowed
what <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cluetrain Manifesto</em></span> said about networked
markets and applied it to voters. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cluetrain</em></span> said,
&ldquo;Markets are getting smarter&mdash;and getting smarter
faster than most companies.&rdquo; The Dean campaign said,
&ldquo;Networked citizens get smarter faster than most
campaigns.&rdquo;
</p><p>
More than 600,000 people joined the campaign, and an untold percentage
of them were out in the world, stumping hard for the candidate,
producing materials, holding meetings and rallies&mdash;with less direct
guidance from the top than perhaps any campaign in the country's
history. More than one volunteer told me the campaign was less a
bandwagon than a runaway train.
</p><p>
I got a surprise ride on that train last summer when I wrote a piece
called &ldquo;Saving the Net&rdquo;
for the
<i  >Linux Journal</i> Web site. It went up on Monday, July 21. Two days later,
on BlogForAmerica, the Dean Campaign Weblog, Matt Gross wrote a post
titled &ldquo;Saving the Net, and Politics, According to Doc Searls, or
Bringing out the Bat&rdquo;. The post was a challenge to raise more money than
Vice President Dick Cheney was scheduled to raise at a $2,000/plate
dinner the next Monday in South Carolina. The punch paragraph:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We're thinking about bringing out the bat on Monday the 28th. We're
thinking that you could demonstrate to Dick Cheney that there is
another way to raise $250,000 in one day&mdash;through the people who
own this democracy, rather than the special interests that buy it.
What do you think? Should we bring out the bat? What should we call
the event?
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Comments, as always, ran in the hundreds. By Saturday
morning they had $82,260.28, and one hour before
Monday, they passed $250,000. The final tally (although
I'm told it continued to go higher): $508,540.31
contributed by 9,601 people. That's an average of
$52.97 apiece.
</p><p>
As Britt and others explained later, the people
turning up the steam during this whole run-up weren't
the campaign workers posting progress reports on the
blog. It was the people down in the blog's comments
section. Opening up comments on the campaign blog
was like sinking an artesian well into the pockets
of hundreds of thousands of supporters.
</p><p>
My visit to the campaign came right before the Iowa Caucuses in January
2004.
The energy at headquarters was at maximum, and everything seemed to
be on track for a series of wins in the primaries. The day after I
returned to New York (for LinuxWorld Expo), Dean lost the Iowa Caucuses,
coming in third. That night he uttered his famous &ldquo;scream&rdquo;, which ABC
News admits
playing a total of &ldquo;700 times in a few days&rdquo;. The rest is history.
</p><p>
Or maybe not. Oddly, DeanForAmerica.com comments kept rolling on.
There were expressions of sympathy for the bombings
in Madrid, suggestions for Kerry cabinet members and practical ideas to
continue applying the energy that persisted in the campaign, even while
few outside the campaign seemed aware of it. Some of the posts were by
Howard Dean himself&mdash;something that rarely happened while the
candidate's presidential hopes still were alive.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xda0580.0xe996e0"></a>
Adaptation Nation</h2></div></div><p>
One of my regrets, while working on this story, was not getting to
Arkansas to see what Cameron Barrett, Tony Steidler-Dennison
and other hackers were doing for the
Wesley Clark campaign. Cam is one of the
original bloggers, and
Tony is a
friend of ours at <i  >Linux Journal</i> and a frequent contributor to the magazine.
</p><p>
Cam and Tony put the whole Clark campaign on an open-source footing,
crafting a bunch of tools that now have returned to the ecosystem, along
with their authors. After the Clark campaign folded, Cam went to work
for the Kerry campaign. Tony went back to playing the role of interested
observer. When I asked Tony what happened to the tools his team
developed for the Clark campaign, he replied:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The tools themselves provided a means for the Clark campaign, in
particular, to get up to speed in a very short time. We wouldn't
have been able to provide the interconnected set of supporter tools
(Clark Community Network&rarr;eBlocks&rarr;on-line contributions&rarr;Clark
Recruiters&rarr;Lawyers for Clark&rarr;various and sundry mailing lists,
and so on) as quickly with proprietary tools. Or as cost-effectively.
</p><p>
These were the first campaigns to use the Internet in a truly
<span   class="emphasis"><em>two-way</em></span> fashion. Cam's Clark Community Network was, I believe, the
most effective tool for supporter community-building of any of the
campaigns. The 2000 campaign used the Internet to convey a message
from the candidate to both actual and potential supporters. It was a
one-way communication. The Dean and Clark campaigns were the first
and most effective at providing a connected voice for supporters to
talk back to the candidates and to talk with one another. In other
words, the campaign communities made the campaigns more than merely
vehicles for fund raising. I can tell you firsthand that the Clark
campaign paid attention to the collective voice of the community.
So, open-source tools allowed us to create a community that actually
had a voice in the campaign.
</p><p>
The most likely legacy of the Clark campaign is Clark TechCorps. The
tools we created to organize the supporter communities are available
under open-source licensing for anyone to use and improve upon.
There's still a fair amount of activity on the TechCorps site as
interested developers continue to work on those tools. We'll have to
see where they go.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Britt Blaser provides a
nice summary of the first well-hacked party presidential playoff season:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Many spent 2003 hacking code because they thought it might transform
politics, and they were more right than wrong. They are the open-source entrepreneurs of the governance tools space. Like all
entrepreneurs, they are artists who create because they're incapable
of not creating.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Joe Trippi called
MeetUp the Dean Campaign's &ldquo;killer app&rdquo;. &ldquo;We built a
hammer&rdquo;, says Scott
Heiferman, &ldquo;and they built a house with it&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Zephyr Teachout, whose visibility as a Dean campaign worker was exceeded
only by Joe Trippi, says MeetUp made such a good tool because what it
built wasn't on-line. MeetUps happen in meat space&mdash;in physical,
geographical reality. Off-Net. Scott Heiferman tells me MeetUp's most
important corporate relationships are with the local restaurants and
coffee shops where MeetUps meet.
</p><p>
So MeetUp succeeded in part because it violated
at least one Web development maxim: it didn't
over-provision its feature set or let its ambitions
fall out of alignment with its core services. And
it kept those services simple, in the tradition of
great practical open-source applications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xda0580.0x1291fb8"></a>
Consider the Source</h2></div></div><p>
Joe Trippi's long career path included a tour of duty with Progeny,
working with Ian Murdock, the co-originator of Debian. It's not
coincidental that Joe called Dean's an &ldquo;open-source
campaign&rdquo; and said
&ldquo;It's like Linux. The more people collaborate, the more likely we'll
build a better thing.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Phil Windley, former CIO of Utah, says we're coming to the end of an era
in which governance is crippled by two waves of opposing ideologies and
ideologues: anti-business lefties in the '60s and '70s and anti-government
righties in the '80s and '90s. &ldquo;Both groups failed to understand that most
citizens don't subscribe to an ideology. In fact, all most people really
want from government is to get the roads fixed.&rdquo; What's exciting now, he
says, is the potential for involvement and participation by ordinary
citizens in the mundane machinery of governance. Already, he says,
countless NGOs (non-governmental organizations) are bringing solutions
to government rather than waiting for the reverse to happen.
</p><p>
I had a chance to witness this first-hand when a friend asked
me to sit in on a meeting between a local group and county supervisors.
The local group had some ideas for improving bandwidth in the county,
and this meeting was the one where they were presenting concrete
recommendations. To my surprise, I found
myself
participating in a productive conversation with elected officials about
an important local issue&mdash;a new experience for me.
</p><p>
The friend who invited me to the meeting doesn't work in government,
but he is an astute
observer of government and how it works. What he told me after the
meeting blew my mind, because it had never occurred to me before, was:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Government isn't the problem. People need to bring solutions to
government. Government is dying for answers. Bring some and you'll
get somewhere.
</p><p>
I don't have experience with the government stonewalling me at all.
I experience interest and cooperation at every level, as long as I
bring solutions and not just problems.
</p><p>
A lot of helpless people want government to solve their problems or
to carry their spear on one issue or another. That reflects an
ignorance of how the whole ecosystem actually works. If you're
constructive, you can participate in that ecosystem. Bureaucrats are
crying for help on all kinds of issues. If we provide some, we can
make stuff get done together.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
&ldquo;Democracy is the first open-source application&rdquo;, Phil Windley says.
More to the point, he considers open-source values such as code exposure, peer
review, individual initiative and iterated inclusion of improved code in
goods that are never quite finished essential to functional democracy
in the long run. In fact, he believes open-source values and practices
will help democracy finally deliver on ideals that have remained
unfulfilled for thousands of years.
</p><p>
In other words, we may finally have the kind of democracy we've always
idealized&mdash;governments not only representative of their
citizens but open to participation by everybody with something to
contribute.
</p><p>
Three interesting facts about that meeting with the county supervisors:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
All the guests in the meeting were technologists. (I was the least
technical of the bunch.)
</p></li><li><p>
All the public servants in the meeting (supervisors and various
staffers) believed that improving Internet bandwidth was a
no-brainer issue.
</p></li><li><p>
It was only natural for government to look to technologists for help.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Here at the local and regional levels of
government, where the density of lobbyists and other pressure groups is
lower than in Washington, pro-Internet technologists are starting to
find themselves in a sellers'
market for their expertise and solutions.
At the very least, we're seeing some interfaces open up. Maybe we'll see
quite a few more soon. According to Zephyr Teachout, over a hundred
candidates now running for public office were inspired by the Dean campaign.
&ldquo;All the significant trends start with technologists&rdquo;, Marc Andreessen says.
</p><p>
Those trends don't have to be technical. Clearly, they also can be
political.
</p><p>
Perhaps now we won't get merely the government we deserve. Maybe now we'll
get the government we hack.
