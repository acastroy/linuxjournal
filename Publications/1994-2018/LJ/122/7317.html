This review marks my second run at Xandros Desktop. I have been using version
1.0 for some time, but when I heard Xandros was releasing version 2.0,
I had to take a look at it.
Three versions of Xandros Desktop 2.0 are available, the Standard,
Deluxe and Business editions. For this
review I focus on the Deluxe edition.
</p><p>
Installation was quick and easy; a fresh install can take as few as four
clicks if you accept the default settings. The install wizard found my
existing copy of Xandros Desktop 1.0 and gave me the option to upgrade
it to 2.0. It kept my existing partitions and users intact. Individual
user preferences were saved in the users' home
directories, where they are easy to restore. It would have been better,
however, if
all user preferences had been detected and updated intact.
</p><p>
After the initial installation, a First
Run wizard walks users through setting up their personal
preferences. Users can change any of these preferences at any time by
using the control centre or the First Run wizard icon found in the system
section of the Launch menu. Right-clicking on the desktop opens the
display properties, which makes changing the display settings easy.
</p><p>
Xandros 2.0's list of built-in applications is extensive. The Standard
and Deluxe editions both come complete with OpenOffice.org 1.1.0. The
Business edition includes StarOffice. Both the Deluxe and
Business editions include CodeWeaver's CrossOver Office 2.1, an essential
tool if you need to run Microsoft Windows applications. All versions
include Mozilla, KDE's KMail, Adobe Acrobat Reader and a plethora of other
applications. In addition, a second CD accompanies the Deluxe and
Business editions that includes tons of additional applications, games
and other utilities.
</p><p>
The big change for version 2.0 is the
focus on multimedia. Xandros now supports drag-and-drop CD burning.
You can create data or music
CDs right from the file manager. There also is built-in support for digital cameras and scanners.
</p><p>
I tried all three of these new multimedia features, with great
success. Although most CD-R/RW drives these days are IDE/ATAPI-compatible,
my old SCSI CD-RW was detected and functional at first boot. The
SCSI scanner was added to the system after installation, and the Hardware
Detection wizard found my scanner and added it to the list of hardware
with absolutely no problem. Even more amazing,
absolutely no configuration was required. I was presented with
a selection window where all scanning devices detected on the system
are listed and chose which one I wanted to use. Having only one
scanner, I really didn't have any options; I was given only one choice.
When I
clicked the Preview Scan button and my scanner started humming, I
indeed was impressed.
</p><p>
I next tried connecting my digital camera to the USB port. I bought a new digital
camera less than a month before doing this review, so it was not on the list
of cameras Digikam supports. The Xandros user manual explains how
to deal with this, though, and I was able to set up Digikam to access my camera
in no time.
</p><p>
Two other applications I found extremely useful were VNC, which Xandros
calls Remote Desktop Sharing (Figure 1), and the Terminal Services
Client. The latter
is not installed by default but is available from the Xandros Networks. I
find both of these applications indispensable and use them on a daily basis
in my work as a network administrator.

</p></div></div><p>
Noticeably absent in the default installed application is a backup
utility. One is available on Xandros Networks, but it seems to be difficult
to configure. It certainly did not like my ARCHIVE DDS1 tape drive,
and the only mention of backups in the user manual is a backup to CD.
</p><p>
One of the biggest changes I had to get used to was the absence of
the previous version's update package manager. I was a little
disappointed to see it not included, because I had become rather accustomed
to it. Xandros now uses Xandros Networks exclusively. It works very
well, but it takes a little getting used to. It's a bit like using a
cross between Microsoft's Windows Updates and dselect on steroids. It's
a browser-like GUI offering the options for a single-button update or
individually selected package installation.
</p><p>I spoke to Erich Forler of Xandros, and he told me that
the Xandros Network subscription included with Xandros Desktop
does not expire. The reason behind this, he said, is because
Xandros wants to make sure that all users have access
to all the latest security and bug fixes, as well as upgrades
to any free software. There is a paid subscription service
available, or will be shortly, that will allow a subscriber
to download the latest enhancements for proprietary packages
before they are released in the next version. </p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7317f2.large.jpg"><img src="7317f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Xandros Networks is a powerful utility for adding and upgrading software.
</p></div></div><p>
As much as I liked the older Xandros Update, I have to admit I really like
the one-button &ldquo;apply all available updates from Xandros&rdquo;
option. It does
not matter which package source you select, this button overrides
it and checks a preconfigured URL for updates. One other difference
between the the older Xandros Update and the newer Xandros Networks is
it is much easier to add a custom package source. Simply type the URL
the same way you would if you were editing /etc/apt/sources.list.
</p><p>
I was not as impressed by the
newer version of CrossOver Office in Xandros 2.0.
I was holding onto one Microsoft Windows application,
Pegasus Mail for Windows, which I have been using for
nearly a decade. I had great success running it previously under WINE
and then CrossOver Office on Xandros 1.0. CrossOver Office 2.1, however,
breaks Pegasus Mail. It still installs, and I still can send and receive
e-mail, but the message window formating is messed up, and it is
now unstable and crashes constantly. The fact that the version
of Pegasus did not change, only the version of the OS and CrossOver,
leads me to believe the issue is not Pegasus Mail.
I tried going through Xandros
support, but they offer support for only the officially supported
applications.
</p><p>
I experienced one other disappointment. After all the hassles of not
being able to run Pegasus any longer, I started using Ximian Evolution,
which Xandros has available for free download from the Xandros Shop
portion of Xandros Network.
I discovered, however, that
the GNOME conduits required to sync with a PalmOS device are not installed with
Ximian, nor are they available on the Xandros Network. Xandros support
was kind enough to point me to an outdated how-to for Xandros
1 and Ximian Evolution 1.2, but it did not work with Xandros Desktop 2 and
Ximian Evolution 1.4.
</p><p>
One of Xandros Desktop's strongest features is its ability to integrate
with an existing network. I personally run a small network that has
some Microsoft Windows fileshares and a shared printer on it. Xandros Desktop
can map the fileshare as folders under the user's home directory.
It also has no problem using the
shared printers from another workstation or server on the network.
Xandros Desktop also uses SAMBA to
share its resources with Microsoft Windows workstations
without any problems.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Overall, I have to say this is the most user-friendly
Linux distribution I have ever used. The Business
edition promises the ability to authenticate users
to a Windows Primary Domain Controller or Active
Directory domain and offers SAP and Citrix clients.
The Deluxe edition is ideal for home or small-business
users in a workgroup environment or for people who don't
need to authenticate to a Windows server. At $89 US,
the Deluxe edition is a steal. I also have to
say that even someone raised on a Windows platform
would feel at home on a PC running Xandros
Desktop 2.0. Better support for CrossOver Office and
other third-party applications on the official update
site is needed, but Xandros Desktop 2.0 still is my
desktop environment and Linux distribution of choice.
