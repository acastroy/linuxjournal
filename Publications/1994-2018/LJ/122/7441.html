State and federal courts in the US are standardizing on
XML for court documents and on open-source management
systems to store and index them.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ec1580.0x1fb92f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Over the past several years, court technology has gone through many
changes. Most notable is the drive to facilitate the electronic filing of
documents by using open-source solutions. Many people have led separate
projects that attempted to provide a blueprint for proper electronic
integration with court case management systems (CMSes). To date, large-scale
success has not been demonstrated in the legal electronic filing industry,
although many small projects have shown promise. All of this may be about
to change, however, as the federal and state court systems start to embrace and
support open-source software.
</p><p>
Each year, approximately 90 million cases are filed in the 17,500
courts in the United States. These cases generate more than 1.5 billion
documents. Aside from the environmental impact, this creates a mountain
of paperwork for court staffs. In addition, storage and indexing costs
associated with archiving and retrieving documents are high. Many
courts are starting to look toward integrated electronic systems to
cut down on the quantity of paperwork and streamline day-to-day
operations. Most courts now use some form of computer-based
case management system or document management system (DMS).
</p><p>
The idea behind electronic court filing is to allow lawyers and the
general public to submit documents to the court over the Internet. Law
firms already generate an electronic version of any document they
plan to file with a court. When filed electronically, the document
automatically is
placed in a DMS, and the pertinent case information is
placed in a CMS.
</p><p>
The current accepted model of how filings should be generated and passed
to a court involves three major components. The first is an electronic
filing service provider (EFSP), the organization responsible
for constructing an electronic legal filing. There could be many of
these organizations in any given legal jurisdiction, all competing for a
per-filing fee paid by lawyers and pro se litigants (people who represent
themselves in court) who use their service. The second component is an
electronic filing manager (EFM). The EFM has a one-to-one relationship
with a court. All EFSPs that offer the ability to file documents
with a specific court need to communicate with that court's EFM.
Court personnel use the EFM to review filed documents
to ensure that any court-specific rules have been followed. The final
component is an adapter that communicates between the EFM and the court's CMS
and DMS systems. This adapter relays the documents and case information
associated with the filing to the court's information systems. Figure
1 shows the organization of this model.

Figure 1. Transferring and Submitting Filings
</p></div></div><p>
A major hurdle to providing this type of functionality is that almost
every CMS used by courts today has been customized on some level to fit
specific needs of individual courts. Many courts even have developed their
own custom solutions in-house. These differences require the EFM to CMS
and DMS adapters to be rewritten for every court.
In response to this problem, many court professionals have pushed
for an industry-endorsed standard for transmitting data between legal
systems. Winchel &ldquo;Todd&rdquo; Vincent III, founder of Legal XML,
stated: &ldquo;Having
an agreed-upon specification to use can greatly reduce the amount of work
required to provide complicated system integration. It allows for all
involved parties to work on the problem together, instead of reinventing
the wheel over and over again.&rdquo;
In addition to an industry standard, there also is a drive to provide an
open-source EFM.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ec1580.0x1fb97c0"></a>Legal XML Is Founded</h2></div></div><p>
In November 1998, Legal XML was established
as a nonprofit organization. The goal was to provide open, nonproprietary
technical specifications for exchanging legal documents and to organize the
related information. It attracted participants from private industry,
other nonprofit organizations, government and academia. Legal XML
originally produced a DTD-based specification, which eventually was used
to help courts exchange information by way of XML.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ec1580.0x1fb98c8"></a>
Georgia Interoperability Project</h2></div></div><p>
The completeness of the Legal XML 1.0 specification was put to the test
when the Georgia Court Automation Committee (GCAC) used it during an
interoperability pilot project. This project acted as a proof of concept
for the electronic filing approach previously described. The first
standards-based electronic filings to occur in the nation were a result of
this project. Filings were generated and received through systems run by
different software providers, proving the feasibility of interoperability
based on open standards. Both federal agencies and state courts actively
followed the project.
</p><p>
The interoperability phase of this project consisted of three EFM
installations. Two of the EFMs facilitated filings with county superior
courts; the other EFM interfaced with a county state court. Three
providers managed the individual EFMs. Four companies provided
EFSP interfaces that were used successfully to file with all three
EFMs. Between January 2003 and January 2004, more than 1,000 filings were
processed electronically. The project was considered a success. Since
its completion, several law enforcement agencies in Georgia now file electronically on
a daily basis.
</p><p>
After the Georgia Interoperability project, integration challenges led
to talk of an open-source solution, and the topic started to spread among the
electronic filing community. The National Center for State Courts
(NCSC) led the way and was one of open source's
bigger proponents, releasing an open-source EFM, inCounter, using the
standard Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/Python/PHP (LAMP) approach. inCounter
was designed to be
a demonstrative application to showcase electronic filing capability
and to promote an open-source solution. counterclaim, Inc.,
the company this author works with, concurrently released
OpenEFM, a 100% Java application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ec1580.0x1fb9ad8"></a>
Why Open Source Is a Good Solution</h2></div></div><p>
Open-source software is a good technical solution to the electronic filing
problem. In many open-source projects, forming an active development
and support community is often difficult. However, a
large number of developers currently are spread throughout courthouses across the United
States. This loose-knit community can be organized within the US judicial
system. These IT staffers share the same challenge of solving similar
electronic filing problems. Because courts are noncompeting entities,
the standard problems regarding intellectual property should evaporate
in favor of collaborative community solutions.
</p><p>
Open source also provides a good economic solution to problems
related to courthouse operational costs. Many courts are strapped for
cash. Purchasing industry-specific proprietary solutions from large
corporations often can be very costly. Although open-source software does
not mean free software, it reduces up-front costs. Courts still incur
costs associated with installing software, teaching people how to use it
and customizing the open-source solution to fit their unique needs. Also,
as with any software solution, ongoing maintenance is needed. Today,
many large companies, in addition to selling software, also act as
consultants to courts, charging large sums of money for services extolling
proprietary solutions. Open-source solutions can cut these costs.
</p><p>
Open source is also a great benefit for court personnel, allowing them to
evaluate the feasibility of a solution before making a commitment. Nothing
prevents an IT technician in any court from downloading the open-source
EFM code and playing with it to determine whether the software meets the court's
needs. On the other hand, proprietary software often is not available for
a complete evaluation until the court has committed to a contract. This
can lead to problematic situations and can leave the court with little
control over timelines and final costs.

NCSC Conference Exposure</h2></div></div><p>
The 2002 biennial eCourt Conference, hosted by NCSC, was a watershed moment,
as open-source solutions were spotlighted. During the conference,
counterclaim's OpenEFM and the NCSC's inCounter were demonstrated and
exposed to the larger legal community. Hundreds of decision-makers
from both federal and state courts all across the country, along with
foreign representatives, witnessed the power of the open-source model.
The information presented led to spirited discussions regarding the
virtues of open source within the legal industry.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ec1580.0x1fb9d98"></a>
Legal XML Moves to OASIS</h2></div></div><p>
About the time of the beginning of the Georgia Interoperability pilot
project, the Legal XML organization went through several changes. As
with any large project, internal organizational issues existed. These
issues resulted in the decision by the founder of Legal XML to leave
the group. After this event, it was proposed that the Legal XML group
move under the umbrella of the Organization for the Advancement of
Structured Information Standards (OASIS), a
not-for-profit global consortium dedicated to promoting development,
implementation and acceptance of electronic business standards. The
OASIS Legal XML Member Section is made up of representatives from both
commercial software companies and governmental court organizations. The
founder of Legal XML, Winchel &ldquo;Todd&rdquo; Vincent III, and Legal
XML itself, both continue to provide valuable and significant contributions in the
area of electronic court filing.

California Second-Generation Electronic Filing</h2></div></div><p>
In October 2002, the California Administrative Office of the Courts
(AOC) decided it was time to define a standard for electronic
filing and data exchange for California courts. This project is
called the Second-Generation Electronic Filing Specification (2GEFS).
Vincent spearheads this effort, together with a group of participating
software companies and selected California courts. Over the course of
several months, specifications were produced by a group of knowledgeable
participants. Recently, the draft XML Schema-based specifications have
been made available publicly for comment by the state of California.
</p><p>
A unique technical aspect that the 2GEFS specifications provides is the
concept of a well-defined Schema framework. This notion came from the
recognition that courts may need to modify data elements slightly to fit
their specific needs. An example of this might be the way a person is
defined by the specification. One court may need to include such information
as a list of identifiable scars, tattoos and birthmarks, whereas
another court may not care to capture this information. The
Schema framework approach creates a decentralized framework of strictly
versioned schemas. Each schema lives in its own namespace and can be
published on multiple servers. This ensures that all past versions of
Schemas are available, and XML instance documents representing filings
can use older Schemas to validate against as needed. This allows courts
to use slightly customized Schemas and put them in their own namespace
under their own control.
</p><p>
These specifications also are out for public comment, and several
companies are working on incorporating them into court filing
software. The specifications are covered under a modified General Public
License. Christopher Smith, the current overseer of the 2GEFS Project,
had the following to say about its success: &ldquo;We're very pleased with the
specifications we have produced. Aside from being easy to understand and
well documented, we feel that they can be a tremendous contribution to
the electronic court filing industry. We are encouraging all interested
parties to see what California has to offer.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Proof-of-concept implementations of the 2GEFS specifications have been
created, and an interoperability-testing phase is scheduled to last
until the middle of 2004. Throughout this project, the state of
California is
working with a number of local courts to integrate their electronic
filing systems.

The Open XML Court Interface</h2></div></div><p>
The Open XML Court Interface (OXCI)
initiative was started in March 2000, but it finally got off the ground
in mid-2003. Its goal is to develop an open-source version of an
EFM. Eleven states have sponsored the initial development and actively
take part in the OXCI consortium. The project is being led by the
AOCs of Georgia and Washington State. The legal community across the
country is anxiously watching the OXCI Project. In January 2004, OXCI
was ready to fund development.
</p><p>
OpenEFM, the open-source EFM supported
by counterclaim, was used as a point of reference many times by the
OXCI team as they worked on an outline for the project requirements and
architectural design. After submitting a response to the AOC of Georgia's
Request for Proposals regarding the OXCI EFM Project, counterclaim was
selected to complete the project development and to provide continuing
support. The development of the OXCI EFM is slated to be complete in
June 2004, after which three courts will be configured to use the new,
open-source system. Once success has been demonstrated, it is likely
that more courts across the US will adopt the OXCI EFM.
</p><p>
Vince Harris, leader of this project for the AOC of Georgia, had the
following to say about OXCI: &ldquo;It has taken a lot of work and effort
by many different people to get us to this point, but we are excited
to be here. With the amount of backing and support the OXCI Project
has received, we have a great opportunity to help solve the electronic
filing problem. Since the EFM will be available at no cost to the courts,
we also feel that our solution has the potential to be very
widespread.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ec1580.0x1fba3c8"></a>
Current State</h2></div></div><p>
At some future point, all courts will offer some form of electronic
filing. In fact, many jurisdictions have passed legislation mandating
such services be made available. By educating the legal community about
available open-source solutions, there is a great chance that the court
community could pool its resources and come together to adopt a solution
that addresses its common needs. OXCI is working to provide that open-source solution. The OASIS Legal XML Member Section is in a great position
to pick and choose the best features from various specification attempts
in order to provide an open industry-endorsed standard to go along with
the open-source EFM. With any luck, and a whole lot of elbow grease, an
open-source approach may become the standard solution endorsed by our
judicial system as the best method to solve the electronic filing problem.
