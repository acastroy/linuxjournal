<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #122, June 2004</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

The <span   class="bold"><b>BIOS</b></span> often is one of the least friendly parts of a
computer. The source code typically is secret, and updates are
almost nonexistent. Most decent OSes try to leave the BIOS behind
as soon as possible, providing their own interfaces to similar
functionality. Sometimes a BIOS bug forces OS developers to
take steps to work around it. This happened recently with the <span   class="bold"><b>eMachines
M6805</b></span>. The BIOS failed to recognize a CPU upgrade and reported the CPU
speed and voltage values as those of the original CPU. <span   class="bold"><b>Tony Lindgren</b></span>
has created a Linux kernel patch to perform some sanity checks on these
machines to correct the values reported by the BIOS.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Benjamin Herrenschmidt</b></span> is working on a
<span   class="bold"><b>sysfs</b></span> interface to <span   class="bold"><b>Open
Firmware</b></span> to provide PPC and PPC64 systems with a full Open Firmware
path. Illustrating the Linux development style, as soon as
Benjamin published his work, various design issues came under scrutiny. In
particular, he had wanted to provide the Open Firmware data as part of the
data for PCI devices, which had the potential to become a mess. Would
all the different buses and all the different firmwares start having to
store data about each other? And, what other parts of the system would
want representation elsewhere as well? <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> suggested keeping
each aspect separate, so that Open Firmware data, even if it addressed
PCI devices, would be found in the Open Firmware subdirectory.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dipankar Sarma</b></span> has produced an API
function that should be able to clean up some
<span   class="bold"><b>ReiserFS</b></span> (and other) code. The function,
<span   class="bold"><b>rcu_barrier()</b></span>, waits for all the
queued <span   class="bold"><b>RCU</b></span>
callbacks to complete. RCU, or Read Copy Update,
is a locking mechanism that allows the OS to access
data shared between multiple CPUs at a
low computational cost [see &ldquo;Using RCU in the 2.5 Kernel&rdquo; by Paul
McKenney, <i  >LJ</i>, October
2003]. Previously, ReiserFS had to implement its
own logic to simulate this functionality. <span   class="bold"><b>Nikita
Danilov</b></span> of the ReiserFS team has been hoping for
this sort of API for quite a while. Once it's accepted
into the main tree, the Reiser folks will be able to
ditch a lot of ugly code.
</p><p>
With the release of Linux 2.0.40 (code-named The Moss-Covered Tortoise),
<span   class="bold"><b>David Weinehall</b></span> has indicated his intention to continue maintaining the
ancient 2.0 series. In 2.0.40, he has fixed a number of security holes and
filesystem corruption issues, among other things. In the announcement,
David affirmed that no new features would go into the 2.0 series. Users
wishing to take advantage of features available in recent kernels,
he says, must upgrade either to the 2.4 or 2.6 tree.
Some systems may have a difficult time upgrading, such as
active servers that have run only 2.0 kernels, which would need to be
redesigned completely for any later kernel. In spite of this, it seems
to be infeasible to provide a smoother upgrade path than what already exists,
given that even-numbered kernels must strive for stability.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Max Asbock</b></span> recently put together a
device driver to support the <span   class="bold"><b>IBM
xSeries RSA service processor</b></span>. The driver, called ibmasm, provides a
user-space interface to send commands, wait for events and handle the
remote video features. One snag in the current design, however, is that
Max's interface is unique in Linux. Although the driver must provide an
interface into the system, he doesn't see a way to provide the &ldquo;one file,
one value&rdquo; mechanism of sysfs. Nor does the driver fit easily into the
category of character device, so he has placed it in the /drivers/misc
directory of the Linux kernel source. Given these anomalies, we might
expect this driver to go through some changes before being adopted in
the kernel proper. If it does get accepted quickly, the interface
still may take some time to settle down, as it gets shoe-horned into
the preferred Linux places.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Gerd Knorr</b></span> has written a driver that,
although not actually providing
any user-visible goodies on its own, will help other drivers deal with
<span   class="bold"><b>infrared remote control</b></span> devices. Drivers like saa7134 and bttv now
will be able to use the regular Linux input layer to access these devices in
a clean fashion. One interesting twist is that the basic Linux module
handling code has changed during the 2.5 time frame, and Gerd has kept to
the old interface, even though his driver is for 2.6. The reason for this has been
that he wants his code to compile under both 2.4 and 2.6, and 2.4 doesn't
support some of the needed functions provided by 2.6. <span   class="bold"><b>Rusty Russell</b></span>, the
developer most responsible for the module interface revamp during 2.5,
seems to be quite active in responding to this type of situation, and he has
said he will implement compatibility functions in 2.4 that will allow
the preferred 2.6 constructions to compile properly on both kernel series.

ASSP is an SMTP proxy that performs Bayesian filtering, has whitelists
and generally tries to identify and reject spam before it's passed on
to your MTA for acceptance and processing. Among the good features
is an easy way to reclassify non-spam as spam merely by forwarding it
to assp-spam@your.domain. Reviewing spam is a little more difficult,
because you actually need to take a quick look through the spam directory
to ensure that no non-spam has been misclassified. Then, do a quick rebuild
of the spam database and you're done. Setup is more intensive, because
you have to let things run for a while, keep an eye on where
they're going and move them as required. But, no mail ever is lost, even
if it is misclassified. ASSP is probably not appropriate for an ISP, but businesses,
especially smaller ones, will like it.
Requires: Perl.

Have you ever found that you can't get to a particular Web site from a Linux
system, but other systems have no problem? Then, you later find out ECN
(explicit congestion
notification) was turned on in the Linux system and that's what caused
the problem? Would you like to be able to check a site for compliance with the
RFCs
or simply find out if they support ECN? ecncheck can do it for you.
Requires: libpthread, glibc and raw socket access.

Nameko is about the easiest-to-install Web-mail application around. This spartan
utility allows you to read and send e-mail on your mail/Web server.
If all you need to do is read and send e-mail, and other e-mail Web
applications are too difficult to install, perhaps this is worth
a try. Simply copy it to your Web server, call up the URL and log in.
Requires: mail and Web server with PHP, browser.

For those of you who have been looking for a Linux HTML editor to replace
FrontPage or Dreamweaver, the newly released Nvu (N-view) aspires to be
that replacement. With Nvu, the most difficult Web-coding jobs become a
snap,
including forms, CSS and more. Most of the features are available and
appear
to work quite well. Future releases should round out the missing pieces;
the framework appears to be in place.
Requires: libmozjs, libxpcom, libplds4, libplc4, libnspr4, libpthread,
libdl, libgtk-x11-2.0, libgdk-x11-2.0, libatk-1.0, libgdk_pixbuf-2.0,

vnStat is a console-based traffic monitor. Unlike other monitors, it
doesn't require root access or use many resources. Basically,
vnStat updates its logs from the /proc filesystem. If you need a
lightweight monitor that can be run by anyone, not only root, this might be
a good choice. Requires: glibc.
