Crypto Error? Quel Horreur!</h4><p>
Dear Mr Gagn&eacute; as a fan of your column, as well as your other writing,
when the paper copy of <i  >LJ</i> was delivered yesterday, I set it aside to read
this afternoon. However, I was disappointed to find a substantial error
regarding digital signatures in your otherwise excellent April 2004 column
&ldquo;Francois, Can You Keep a Secret?&rdquo;
About 3/4 of the way through your column, you write:
&ldquo;Signing a message makes use of your key by attaching an electronic
signature (your public key) to your message, but not encrypting it.
The person receiving the message then has a means of verifying that the
message did indeed come from you....&rdquo;
</p><p>
The originator's public key has little to do with it other than
providing a means to conduct the eventual verification.
In the context of a signed e-mail, a digital signature
is a hash (either MD5 or SHA1) of the signed object
(a collection of bytes made up of the message text and
any attachments) that is in turn encrypted using the
originator's private key. Thus you have the original
message, perhaps with an attachment, which has been
hashed, and the resulting hash encrypted and then
attached to the signed object.
This process provides a mechanism for
two services, establishing message integrity and
message attribution. Message integrity is provided by
the hash, and message attribution is provided by the
encryption of the hash value. Signature verification
is carried out as roughly outlined below.
</p><p>
The recipient of a signed message, when they
choose to verify it, simply decrypts the attached
signature using the public key of the purported
sender, re-runs the hash on the received message
and matches the results. If they match, two
things are established: the sender had the private
key associated with the public key used for the
decryption, and the message had not been changed
in transit. If they don't match, either the message
was tampered with or the hash was encrypted using a
private key that did not match the public key used.
Most of the various public/private key schemes&mdash;GPG,
PGP or X509 S/MIME&mdash;have individual mechanisms for
determining whether it is a key mismatch or a change
in the signed object.

thanks for the sharp eye. On seeing your message,
I was frankly shocked that I would have written
something like this. I honestly do know better.
I always take great care to make sure that what
I write is both easy to understand and accurate.
This one slipped by me.

All I can say is wow. Thanks so much for the
following four articles [<i  >LJ</i>, April 2004]:
&ldquo;Writing a Simple USB Driver&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Hidden Treasures

it was there.
</p><p>
In case no one's mentioned it, Greg Kroah-Hartman is
awesome. I've always wanted to baby-step my way into
writing device drivers, and his article was just what
I was looking for. I only wish the LED lamp wasn't $80
(I'm a dad and a small-business owner, so $80 is a
bit out of my reach for a mood light).

I would like to see the article &ldquo;SPF Overview&rdquo; from

Please Submit Your Drive Info to smartmontools</h4><p>
I didn't see the January 2004 article [&ldquo;Monitoring Hard Disks with
SMART&rdquo; by Bruce Allen], but after reading
Marshall Lake's comments on SMART [Letters, <i  >LJ</i>,
April 2004], I checked it
out. Here are the results:


<pre     class="programlisting">
[root@gandalf tmp]# smartctl -i /dev/hdb
smartctl version 5.21 Copyright (C) 2002-3 Bruce Allen

I don't like that &ldquo;Not in smartctl database&rdquo; portion. If
Marshall has a disk that is the same as mine, it MAY
explain what his problems are. I am NOT going to run
the smartctl command with the -t option given that
kind of information.
Because I never had a problem with disks, I am going to
take my chances. I think a survey of other Linux
users' experiences running smartctl is in order here.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
HHH   <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bruce Allen replies:</b></span>
if you run <tt  >smartctl -V</tt>, you'll notice that
smartmontools comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
And we mean it. You, as a user, can get open-source
software like Fedora for free. But the flip side of
this equation is that you, as a user, also have more
responsibility: you have to read the documentation
to understand what the software does and ultimately
to contribute something back to the Open Source
community.
If you read the smartmontools Web page FAQ, you'll
notice it states very clearly that not having
a drive in the database is NOT an issue. Though,
as an open-source user, it would sure be nice if you
spent a few minutes (as described) to help us add it
in to the database.
</p><p>
In fact, another user has already done this for
your drive. Fedora is distributed with version
5.21 of smartmontools. If you upgrade to the current
stable release (smartmontools 5.30), you'll find that
your drive IS in the database.
</p><p>
A few minutes of research with Google (or browsing
the smartmontools-support mailing list archive) will
show that thousands of people have used these tools
without problems. In fact, because they are distributed
with virtually every major Linux distribution, I
expect the number of users is several orders of
magnitude larger.
</p><p>
You wrote, &ldquo;Since I never had a problem with disks, I
am going to just take my chances.&rdquo; Without intending
any lack of respect (I am sure you are an
intelligent and thoughtful person) this is foolhardy.
If you store any data you can't replace, you
MUST back it up. Just &ldquo;taking your chances&rdquo; means
you will, eventually, lose some or all of it.
</p><p>
Can smartctl provoke problems? As I said in my
reply to Lake, the answer is yes, if a disk is
already failing. An extended self test with <tt  >smartctl -t
long</tt> will read-scan the entire disk surface. If a
disk already has problems, such a scan will probably
reveal them. For a very marginal disk, it could be
the &ldquo;straw that breaks the camel's back&rdquo; and provoke
catastrophic disk failure. Note that this also applies
to backups: the very act of backing up a disk (and
thus reading all the files on it) can also cause
a marginal disk to fail. Does this mean you
shouldn't back up? No! It means you should keep
multiple backups, and back up frequently, so that if
a disk fails during a backup, not everything is lost.
</p><p>
Please keep in mind that <tt  >smartctl -t long</tt>
is simply sending a SMART command to the disk.
The effects of that command depend upon the disk
firmware, written by the engineers who designed
the disk, not on smartmontools. I am aware of at
least one disk family (an old IBM deskstar series)
where some SMART commands did provoke such problems.
smartmontools will recognize such disks (from the
database) and issue a warning and a pointer to a
site where you can get upgraded firmware from IBM.
I am not aware of any such issues with Maxtor disks.
</p><p>
I advise you to re-think what you have said. Burying
your head in the sand and taking your chances
is not an intelligent and responsible approach.

SMART Saved My Data</h4><p>
Thank you for your wonderful article on the
SMART tools [<i  >LJ</i>, January 2004]. That
one article was worth my entire year's subscription
to <i  >LJ</i>. Using the information in your article, I
was able to run tests on all my machines and found
two drives that were failing but had not yet died.
As a consequence, I was able to preserve my data and avoid
a rebuild. In both cases, the drives were
still under warranty, so the manufacturer replaced
them on the strength of the printout from smartctl.
Excellent! This one has earned a place in my toolkit!

Set-Top Box Docs, Please</h4><p>
I have started a grassroots campaign aimed at
convincing IBM to open up and free the programming
documentation for its STB (Set-Top Box) series chips
(<a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/chips/products/digitalvideo/products/settopbox.html" target="_self">www-306.ibm.com/chips/products/digitalvideo/products/settopbox.html</a>). You can find the campaign home page at
<a href="http://www.users.bigpond.net.au/mysite/freestb.htm" target="_self">www.users.bigpond.net.au/mysite/freestb.htm</a>.
</p><p>
I'm not sure what the origin is of the practice of
hiding chip documentation behind an NDA. Surely
companies like IBM don't think that an NDA would
in some way keep them one step ahead of the other
chip manufacturers?
I think such information hiding is a relic of the
days of proprietary computing, and chips haven't felt
the wind of open source, so to speak.
</p><p>
This is a sub-$100, TV-connected Linux
machine that uses an STBx25xx chip
(<a href="http://www.hauppauge.com/html/mediamvp_datasheet.htm" target="_self">www.hauppauge.com/html/mediamvp_datasheet.htm</a>).
Here are the hardware specs of the Mediamvp machine:

</p><p>
Projects like this would benefit from public and
free access to the documentation and drivers
(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mvpmc" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/mvpmc</a>).
I'm hoping to spread the word and build public
pressure on IBM to address the issue. Any help that
you might be able to give would be appreciated.

Photo of the Month: Satisfied Home Users</h4><p>
As one of your subscribers, I can't help noticing
that some members of readers' families are
introduced to the benefits of Linux, and <i  >LJ</i> of course,
at a very early age. Quite rightly so of course, and
so far we've already seen nice examples of pictures
in the Letters section.
However, I would like to demonstrate that the
reverse is also true. I recently converted my
parents, Mr and Mrs A. J. van der Kleij of Delfgauw,
The Netherlands (ages 79 and 77), to Linux by upgrading
their PC from Windows 95 to Red Hat 7.3.
As can be seen in the photograph, they are very
happy with Linux and found the conversion quite
easy. They routinely use OpenOffice.org for their paper
correspondence and Mozilla for e-mail and browsing. The
only drawback is that I get less homecooked food
now because they don't need my support as often.

Penguin Art Still in Demand</h4><p>
Please find attached a photo of my granddaughter

penguin collection and wanted to add one of her own.
So as you see, I now have a Chlo&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;Original Tux

better than any I could have done myself. Plus, she's
a future Linux user.

Bad register.com, Bad, Bad</h4><p>
After reading the article &ldquo;SPF Overview&rdquo; by Meng
Weng Wong in the April 2004 issue, I tried adding a txt
record for SPF to my DNS entry on register.com.
After finding no way to do this I sent them an e-mail
on the subject. I got the reply:
&ldquo;We would like to inform you that currently we
do not support to add txt record to the DNS (name
servers). We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience
caused to you.&rdquo;

A returnpath.biz study showed that 18.7% of legit
marketing mail sent in the second half of 2003 was
blocked by spam filters. If register.com wants to
keep business customers who send newsletters or other
marketing mail, they'll have to start supporting
SPF.  &mdash;Ed.
