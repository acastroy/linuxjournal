Bringing the code as close to the antenna as possible is the goal of software radio. GNU Radio
gives you the tools to join the communication revolution powered by today's
fast processors.</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf25580.0x101d2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Software radio is the technique of getting code
as close to the antenna as possible. It turns
radio hardware problems into software problems.
The fundamental characteristic of software radio is
that software defines the transmitted waveforms, and
software demodulates the received waveforms. This is
in contrast to most radios in which the processing is
done with either analog circuitry or analog circuitry
combined with digital chips. GNU Radio is a free
software toolkit for building software radios.
</p><p>
Software radio is a revolution in radio design due to its ability to
create radios that change on the fly, creating new choices for users.
At the baseline, software radios can do pretty much anything a
traditional radio can do. The exciting part is the flexibility that
software provides you. Instead of a bunch of fixed function gadgets,
in the next few years we'll see a move to universal communication
devices. Imagine a device that can morph into a cell phone and
get you connectivity using GPRS, 802.11 Wi-Fi, 802.16 WiMax, a
satellite hookup or the emerging standard of the day. You could
determine your location using GPS, GLONASS or both.
</p><p>
Perhaps most exciting of all is the potential to build
decentralized communication systems. If you look at today's systems,
the vast majority are infrastructure-based. Broadcast radio
and TV provide a one-way channel, are tightly regulated and the
content is controlled by a handful of organizations. Cell
phones are a great convenience, but the features your phone supports
are determined by the operator's interests, not yours.
</p><p>
A centralized system limits the rate of innovation. We could take
some lessons from the Internet and push the smarts out to the edges.
Instead of cell phones being second-class citizens, usable only if
infrastructure is in place and limited to the capabilities determined
worthwhile by the operator, we could build smarter devices. These
user-owned devices would generate the network.
They'd create a mesh among themselves, negotiate for backhaul and be
free to evolve new solutions, features and applications.

The Block Diagram</h2></div></div><p>
Figure 1 shows a typical block diagram for a software radio. To
understand the software part of the radio, we first need to understand
a bit about the associated hardware. Examining the receive path in
Figure 1, we see an antenna, a mysterious RF front end, an
analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and a bunch of code. The analog-to-digital
converter is the bridge between the physical world of continuous
analog signals and the world of discrete digital samples manipulated
by software.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7319f1.large.jpg"><img src="7319f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Typical Software Radio Block Diagram
</p></div></div><p>
ADCs have two primary characteristics, sampling rate and
dynamic range. Sampling rate is the number of times per
second that the ADC measures the analog signal. Dynamic range refers
to the difference between the smallest and largest signal that can be
distinguished; it's a function of the number of bits in the ADC's
digital output and the design of the converter. For example,
an 8-bit converter at most can represent 256
(2<sup  >8</sup>) signal
levels, while a 16-bit converter represents up to 65,536 levels.
Generally speaking, device physics and cost impose trade-offs between
the sample rate and dynamic range.
</p><p>
Before we dive into the software, we need to talk about a bit of theory.
In 1927, a Swedish-born physicist and electrical
engineer named Harry Nyquist determined that to avoid
aliasing when converting from analog to digital, the ADC sampling
frequency must be at least twice the bandwidth of the signal of
interest. Aliasing is what makes the wagon wheels look like
they're going backward in the old westerns: the sampling rate of the
movie camera is not fast enough to represent the
position of the spokes unambiguously.
</p><p>
Assuming we're dealing with low pass signals&mdash;signals where
the bandwidth of interest goes from 0 to f<sub  >MAX</sub>, the Nyquist
criterion states that our sampling frequency needs to be at least 2 *
f<sub  >MAX</sub>. But if our ADC runs at 20MHz, how can we listen to
broadcast FM radio at 92.1MHz? The answer is the RF front
end.
The receive RF front end translates a range of frequencies appearing
at its input to a lower range at its output. For example, we could
imagine an RF front end that translated the signals occurring in the
90&ndash;100MHz range down to the 0&ndash;10MHz range.
</p><p>
Mostly, we can treat the RF front end as a black box with a single
control, the center of the input range that's to be translated. As a
concrete example, a cable modem tuner module that we've
employed successfully has the following characteristics. It translates a 6MHz
chunk of the spectrum centered between about 50MHz and 800MHz down to
an output range centered at 5.75MHz. The center frequency of the
output range is called the intermediate frequency, or IF.
</p><p>
In the simplest-thing-that-possibly-could-work category,
the RF front end may be eliminated altogether. One GNU Radio
experimenter has listened to AM and shortwave broadcasts
by connecting a 100-foot piece of wire directly to his 20M sample/sec
ADC.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf25580.0x101dad8"></a>
On to the Software</h2></div></div><p>
GNU Radio provides a library of signal processing primitives and the
glue to tie it all together. The programmer builds a radio by
creating a graph (as in graph theory) where the nodes are signal
processing primitives and the edges represent the data flow between
them.
The signal processing primitives are implemented in C++.
Conceptually, primitives process infinite streams of data flowing from
their input ports to their output ports. Primitives' attributes
include the number of input and output ports they have as well as the
type of data that flows through each. The most frequently used types
are short, float and complex.
</p><p>
Some primitives have only output ports or input ports. These serve as
data sources and sinks in the graph. There are sources that read
from a file or ADC, and sinks that write to a file, digital-to-analog
converter (DAC) or graphical display. About 100 primitives come with
GNU Radio. Writing new primitives is not difficult.
</p><p>
Graphs can be constructed and run in C++, but the easy way to glue
everything together is with Python. Listing 1 is the &ldquo;Hello
World&rdquo; of
GNU Radio. It generates two sine waves and outputs them to the sound
card, one on the left channel, one on the right.

Listing 1. Hello World (Dial Tone Output)</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/env python

from GnuRadio import *

def build_graph ():
    sampling_freq = 32000
    ampl = 8192

    fg = gr_FlowGraph ()

    src0 = GrSigSourceS (
        sampling_freq, GR_SIN_WAVE, 350, ampl)

    src1 = GrSigSourceS (
        sampling_freq, GR_SIN_WAVE, 440, ampl)

    sink = GrAudioSinkS ()

    fg.start ()        # fork thread(s) and return
    raw_input ('Press Enter to quit: ')
    fg.stop ()
</pre></div><p>
We start by creating a flow graph to hold the primitives and
connections between them. The two sine waves are generated by the
GrSigSourceS calls. The S suffix indicates that the source produces
shorts. One sine wave is at 350Hz, and the other is at 440Hz. Together,
they sound like the US dial tone.
</p><p>
GrAudioSinkS is a sink that writes its input to the sound card. It
takes one or two streams of shorts as its input. We connect the three
primitives together using the connect method of the flow graph. Once
the graph is built, we start it. Calling start forks one or more
threads to run the computation described by the graph and returns
control immediately to the caller. In this case, we simply wait for any
keystroke.

Listing 2 shows a somewhat simplified but complete broadcast FM
receiver. It includes control of the RF front end and all required
signal processing. This example uses an RF front end built from a

Like the Hello World example, we build a graph, connect the
primitives together and start it. In this case, our source is the high-speed ADC, GrHighSpeedADC. We follow it with
GrFreqXlatingFIRfilterSCF, a finite impulse response (FIR) filter that selects the FM station we're looking
for and translates it to baseband (0Hz, DC).
With the 20M sample/sec
converter and cable modem tuner, we're really grabbing something in
the neighborhood of a 6MHz chunk of the spectrum. This single chunk
may contain ten or more FM stations, and GrFreqXlatingFIRfilterSCF allows
us to select the one we want. In this case, we select the one
at the exact center of the IF of the RF front end (5.75MHz).
The output of GrFreqXlatingFIRfilterSCF is a stream of complex samples
at 160,000 samples/second. We feed the complex baseband signal into
GrQuadratureDemodCF, the block that does the actual FM demodulation.
GrQuadratureDemodCF works by subtracting the angle of each adjacent
complex sample, effectively differentiating the frequency. The output
of GrQuadratureDemodCF contains the left-plus-right FM mono audio
signal, the stereo pilot tone at 19kHz, the left-minus-right stereo
information centered at 38kHz and any other sub-carriers above that.
For this simplified receiver, we finish off by low pass filtering and
decimating the stream, keeping only the left-plus-right audio
information, and send that to the sound card at 32,000 samples/sec.
See the GNU Radio Wiki for discussions and tutorials on signal
processing.

Graphical User Interfaces</h2></div></div><p>
Graphical interfaces for GNU Radio applications are built in Python.
Interfaces may be built using any toolkit you can access from Python;
we recommend wxPython to maximize cross-platform portability.
GNU Radio provides primitives that use interprocess communication to
transfer chunks of data from the real-time C++ flow graph to
Python-land.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf25580.0x101e478"></a>
Hardware Requirements</h2></div></div><p>
GNU Radio is reasonably hardware-independent. Today's commodity
multi-gigahertz, super-scalar CPUs with single-cycle floating-point
units mean that serious digital signal processing is possible on the
desktop. A 2GHz Pentium or Athlon can evaluate 2 billion
floating-point FIR taps/s. We now can build, virtually all in
software, communication systems unthinkable only a few years
ago.
</p><p>
Your computational requirements depend on what you're trying to do,
but generally speaking, a 1 or 2GHz machine with at least 256MB of
RAM should suffice. You also need some way to connect the analog
world to your computer. Low-cost options include built-in sound cards and
audiophile quality 96kHz, 24-bit, add-in cards. With either of these
options,
you are limited to processing relatively narrow band signals and
need to use some kind of narrow-band RF front end.
</p><p>
Another possible solution is an off-the-shelf, high-speed PCI analog-to-digital board. These are available in the 20M sample/sec
range, but they are expensive, about the cost of a complete PC. For these
high-speed boards, cable modem tuners make reasonable RF front ends.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf25580.0x101e630"></a>
The Universal Software Radio Peripheral</h2></div></div><p>
The preferred solution is the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP).
Figure 2 shows the block diagram of the USRP.
The brainchild of Matt Ettus, the USRP is an extremely flexible USB
device that connects your PC to the RF world. The USRP consists of a
small motherboard containing up to four 12-bit 64M sample/sec ADCs, four
14-bit, 128M sample/sec DACs, a million gate-field programmable gate array
(FPGA) and a programmable USB 2.0 controller. Each fully populated
USRP motherboard supports four daughterboards, two for receive and two
for transmit. RF front ends are implemented on the daughterboards. A
variety of daughterboards is available to handle different frequency
bands. For amateur radio use, low-power daughterboards are available
that receive and transmit in the 440MHz band and the 1.24GHz band.
A receive-only daughterboard based on a cable modem tuner is available
that covers the range from 50MHz to 800MHz. Daughterboards are
designed to be easy to prototype by hand in order to facilitate
experimentation.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7319f2.large.jpg"><img src="7319f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP)
</p></div></div><p>
The flexibility of the USRP comes from the two programmable components
on the board and their interaction with the host-side library. To get
a feel for the USRP, let's look at its boot sequence. The USRP
itself contains no ROM-based firmware, merely a few bytes that specify
the vendor ID (VID), product ID (PID) and revision. When the USRP is
plugged in to the USB for the first time, the host-side library sees an
unconfigured USRP. It can tell it's unconfigured by reading the VID, PID
and revision. The first thing the library code does is download the
8051 code that defines the behavior of the USB peripheral controller.
When this code boots, the USRP simulates a USB disconnect and
reconnect. When it reconnects, the host sees a different device: the
VID, PID and revision are different. The firmware now running
defines the USB endpoints, interfaces and command handlers. One
of the commands the USB controller now understands is <tt  >load the
FPGA</tt>. The library code, after seeing the USRP reconnect as the new
device, goes to the next stage of the boot process and downloads the
FPGA configuration bitstream.
</p><p>
FPGAs are generic hardware chips whose behavior is determined by the
configuration bitstream that's loaded into them. You can think of the
bitstream as object code. The bitstream is the output of compiling a
high-level description of the design. In our case, the design is
coded in the Verilog hardware description language. This is source
code and, like the rest of the code in GNU Radio, is licensed under
the GNU General Public License.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf25580.0x101e9f8"></a>
What Goes in the FPGA?</h2></div></div><p>
An FPGA is like a small, massively parallel computer that you design to
do exactly what you want. Programming the FPGA takes a bit of skill,
and mistakes can fry the board permanently. That said, we provide a
standard configuration that is useful for a wide variety of
applications.
</p><p>
Using a good USB host controller, the USRP can sustain 32MB/sec across
the USB. The USB is half-duplex. Based on your needs, you partition
the 32MB/sec between the transmit and the receive directions. In the
receive direction, the standard configuration allows you to select the
part or parts of the digitized spectrum you're interested in,
translate them to baseband and decimate as required. This is exactly
equivalent to what's happening in the RF front end, only now we're
doing it on digitized samples. The block of code that performs this
function is called a digital down converter (Figure 3). One
advantage of performing this function in the digital domain is we
can change the center frequency instantaneously, which is handy
for frequency hopping spread spectrum systems.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7319f3.large.jpg"><img src="7319f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Digital Down Converter Block Diagram
</p></div></div><p>
In the transmit direction, the exact inverse is performed. The FPGA
contains multiple instances of the digital up and down
converters. These instances can be connected to the same or different
ADCs, depending on your needs. We don't have room here to cover all the
theory behind them; see the GNU Radio Wiki for more information.

GNU Radio Applications</h2></div></div><p>
In addition to the examples discussed above, GNU Radio comes with a
complete HDTV transmitter and receiver, a spectrum analyzer,
an oscilloscope, concurrent multichannel receiver and an ever-growing
collection of modulators and demodulators.

Projects under investigation or in progress include:

Politics</h2></div></div><p>
Every revolution has its political issues. Free software for
building radios is troublesome to some people. In the US, we've run
into opposition from the Motion Picture Association of America and
its attempt with the Broadcast Flag to restrict the kinds of
receivers that can be built for over-the-air digital TV.
</p><p>
The US Federal Communications Commission has issued a Notice of
Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) concerning &ldquo;Cognitive Radio Technologies and
Software Defined Radios&rdquo;.
Several troublesome issues are raised in the NPRM, including
restricting the sale of high-speed digital-to-analog converters,
requirements for digital signatures or similar methods to keep
unauthorized software out of software radio hardware and new
restrictions on radios built for the amateur radio market.

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
Software radio is an exciting field, and GNU Radio provides the
tools to start exploring. A deep understanding of software radio
requires knowledge from many domains. We're doing our best to lower
the barriers to entry.
