Here's how to
clean up the little obstacles that are keeping
your company away from desktop Linux.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e49580.0x1f41298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Back in December 1995, <i  >Linux Journal</i> reviewed a new Linux
distribution called Caldera Network Desktop (CND) from a new company
called, as you might remember, Caldera. Although CND made a big splash
with a GUI environment and Novell client support, it didn't exactly
get the corporate desktop migrated to Linux right away.
</p><p>
In the almost nine years since CND came out, more waves of Linux
desktop releases have crashed against the rocks, then rolled back.
But each wave has fixed important obstacles to putting Linux on
everyone's computer.
</p><p>
The GNOME and KDE Projects, and the freedesktop.org interoperability
effort that is making their software work together, are finally
bringing user interface sanity to the X Window System. Ambitious
contributions from companies, AOL to Ximian, have filled in big
pieces, including a world-class browser, office suite and graphics
libraries.
</p><p>
All that is keeping corporate users away from Linux now is the
details. It's the little things in real-world IT environments that
seem to make desktop Linux a &ldquo;maybe-next-year&rdquo; project. You might
have a stubborn, difficult-to-port, in-house application written
for a legacy, non-Linux, OS. You might be working with an embedded
device or application service provider whose supposedly Web-based
software has a bug that keeps it from working with the Web browsers
available for Linux.
</p><p>
Successful Linux desktop plans depend on the details. The office
suite is an anchor that keeps non-Linux desktops around. But it
might be easier to switch than you think. Bruce Byfield breaks
down this intimidating task on page 52.
</p><p>
If you think that integrating your own programs and scripts with
office suite documents means you have to wait for some office
suite vendor to release an upgrade, think again. James Britt shows
how to write simple software that handles OpenOffice.org documents
on page 78.
</p><p>
Even if you don't have a Linux desktop migration planned now,
make sure not to make development choices that will cause migration
problems later. Future-proof software is cross-platform, and you'll
be able to upgrade from your legacy Mac OS systems to
Linux seamlessly, if you develop now with Renaissance, which Ludovic Marcotte
explains on page 58. You can even move scripts from any platform
to Linux using Tcl/Tk, which Derek Fountain covers on page 83.
</p><p>
Moving to Linux doesn't mean users have to give up fun with photos
and sounds. Learn about XMMS and a fun photo editing trick on
pages 68 and 88. Last and most important, in most companies,
if you can't sell management on it, you won't get it. Make the
case for your desktop Linux migration in style, on Linux, with Rob
Reilly's presentation advice for speakers on page 46.
