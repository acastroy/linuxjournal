Who says you have to wait for some future OS to
integrate your office documents with business applications you develop?
Work with OpenOffice.org's XML-based documents using
Ruby.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a8f580.0x2b87298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
OpenOffice.org (OOo), a featureful suite of office tools that includes
applications for word processing, spreadsheet creation and
presentation authoring, has seen an increase in enhancements and
overall quality. OOo lives up to its name by making
both source code and file formats completely open. This is a
big plus for anyone wishing to manipulate documents without
needing to have the creator application present.
</p><p>
In general, two ways exist to access or manipulate
document content. One is to automate the source application,
letting a program substitute for a person entering commands.
The other is to go directly to the document. An advantage
of the first approach is you get to exploit the power of
an existing application, saving yourself a good deal of time
figuring out file formats and processing commands. OOo
can execute internal macros and expose a scripting interface
through UNO. The downside is you need to have
the actual application handy, and even then it may not be able
to do what you want.
This article describes the second approach: accessing
and manipulating documents by going directly to
the source.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a8f580.0x2b873f8"></a>
OOo Extract</h2></div></div><p>
I first became aware of what could be done with an OpenOffice.org
document when Daniel Carrera announced his OOoExtract program.
This is a Ruby application that allows you to run command-line
searches of OOo Writer document content. As the home
page states, OOoExtract performs matches on both text
content and styles, executes search patterns using full regular
expressions and runs searches built with Boolean operators.
The program runs on any platform that has a Ruby interpreter,
and they are available for pretty much every OS around.
</p><p>
Ruby has been discussed before in <i  >Linux Journal</i>, but if you are
not familiar with it, a good though brief description might be
to say it's a cross between Perl and Smalltalk, with some
features from Lisp and Python. It is deeply object-oriented
and has a clean intuitive syntax. Yukihiro &ldquo;Matz&rdquo; Matsumoto,
its creator, released the first alpha version in 1994. It has
grown steadily in popularity, and the Third International Ruby
Conference was held in November 2003, in Austin, Texas.
</p><p>
To get a feel for OOoExtract, download the program; currently,
you can get the application as a single executable file or as a
tarball with constituent libraries in separate files.
Once installed, we can
create a simple Writer document and run some
searches. If you have OOo handy, fire it up and enter
some brief text, such as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
My sample document
It has two lines
</pre>
</p><p>
Save the file as sample1.sxw to the same directory where you
installed OOoExtract, and run OOoExtract from the command line,
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./ooo_extract.rb --text sample sample1.sxw
My sample document
</pre>
</p><p>
The program searches sample1.sxw for any lines that match
on the word sample. Actually, this is a regular expression,
albeit a simple one. We also can use more complex expressions, such
as this one that matches any three-letter word:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./ooo_extract.rb --text "\s\w\w\w\s"  sample1.sxw
It has two lines
</pre>
</p><p>
This is all well and good, but OOoExtract really shines by
letting us search on content metadata, the extra information
about the text in our document. Suppose we add an additional
line to our sample Writer document:

<pre     class="programlisting">
This one has some extra formatting
</pre>
</p><p>
After entering the text, select the word extra and apply the
Footer paragraph style. Save the file and run this search:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./ooo_extract.rb --style="Footer"  sample1.sxw
This one has some extra formatting
</pre>
</p><p>
In addition to locating text based on content, OOoExtract
also can give you text with specific markup. This is quite
handy if you create your own semantically rich styles.
You then can use OOoExtract to retrieve information based on
content and meaning, effectively turning an OpenOffice.org Writer
document into a lightweight database. You can run the program
against multiple files by using wild cards in the filename.
For example, suppose you store recipes in Writer files. If you've defined and
used custom styles, you could locate specific information,
such as what recipes have apples as an ingredient:


<pre     class="programlisting">
./ooo_extract.rb --text="apple" --style="Ingredient" recipes/*.sxw
AppleSalsa.sxw: 2 medium red apples
AppleStrudel.sxw: 4 cups peeled and sliced apples
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a8f580.0x2b87ad8"></a>
The SXW File Format</h2></div></div><p>
So, how does OOoExtract do its magic? The secret is in
the file format. Although any given Writer file has
an sxw file extension, running the UNIX file command tells us
that it is a zip file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ file sample1.sxw
sample1.sxw: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a8f580.0x2b87c38"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And what has been zipped? Let's see:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ unzip -l sample1.sxw
Archive:  sample1.sxw
  Length     Date   Time    Name
 --------    ----   ----    ----
       30  11-26-03 01:40   mimetype
     2328  11-26-03 01:40   content.xml
     8358  11-26-03 01:40   styles.xml
     1159  11-26-03 01:40   meta.xml
     7021  11-26-03 01:40   settings.xml
      752  11-26-03 01:40   META-INF/manifest.xml
 --------                   -------
    19648                   6 files
</pre>
</p><p>
The OOo XML format exposes all content and metadata in
plain text; there is no need to worry about cryptic binary
encoding or complex layout. Because the data is exposed as
XML, numerous existing XML tools are available for
extra OOo parsing. Having the file in plain text means, of
course, that anything you might want to know about the file is
available if you simply look. However, we get a good deal
of help because the OpenOffice.org team also provides assorted
documentation detailing the format. The technical reference
manual for OpenOffice.org XML File Format 1.0 is a 571-page
PDF document. I confess to not having read the entire tome,
though I doubt it lacks any detail one might care to find.
</p><p>
For our purposes, we need look only at some basic markup to see
how OOoExtract works and to gain some understanding of the markup.
</p><p>
If you unzip our sample document and load content.xml into a
text editor, you should notice a few things. First, the file
is not formatted for your viewing pleasure. You may want to
run the file though an XML-formatting tool, such as tidy, to get some
new lines and indentations in place to make it easier to follow.
</p><p>
The file starts with an XML declaration, followed by
a DOCTYPE reference. Right after that comes the root element,
office:document-content. The beginning tag has a good number of
XML namespace attributes. We needn't be concerned with these,
but they give some idea of the range of content one might
find in an OOo document.
</p><p>
Immediately inside the root element we find child elements for
scripts, font declarations and styles. As ours is a fairly
simple document, the data here is sparse. For our immediate
interests, the useful stuff comes inside the office:body
element. Yet, even here, a few elements simply
declare the presence (or, in our case, the absence) of various
items, such as tables and illustrations. The full document
is available from the <i  >Linux Journal</i> FTP site [<a href="../listings/119/7236.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue119/7236.tgz</a>].
</p><p>
The real content in our document appears inside of text:p
elements:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;text:p text:style-name="Standard"&gt;My sample
document&lt;/text:p&gt;
&lt;text:p text:style-name="Standard"&gt;It has two
lines&lt;/text:p&gt;
&lt;text:p text:style-name="Footer"&gt;This one has
some extra formatting&lt;/text:p&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Incidentally, if you are unfamiliar with some of
the details of XML syntax, this notation simply says that it is a
p element, defined in the text namespace. The use of the
prefix and colon is a shorthand way to reference the namespace
URI given at the top of the document. It's used to avoid name
collisions with other p elements that may be defined for
some other XML vocabulary. For our purposes we can simply
think of it as one complete element name.
</p><p>
Our sample document had only three paragraphs, so as we might
expect, there are three text:p elements. Each one has
a text:style-name attribute that indicates a style to apply to
the text. It is this attribute that lets OOoExtract locate
text based on styles.
</p><p>
You may be wondering about the Footer style.
Our content.xml file does not define it, and indeed this
separation of style name from implementation detail is good.
It would be a shame if instead of a simple
name, the document had assorted attributes for font size and family, color
and so on. The ability to locate content based on semantic
or structural data would be lost, and we would be confined to
treating the data strictly in rendering terms. If you really
do want to see how OOo defined the Footer style, you
can peer into styles.xml. There you'll find that Footer is
based on the Standard style, with a few changes.

From Zip to REXML</h2></div></div><p>
It's all well and good that OpenOffice.org uses zipped XML, but
once we've extracted these files, what is next? Lucky
for us, Ruby 1.8 includes an outstanding XML parser, REXML.
REXML is an XML 1.0 conformant parser, and in addition to
its own Ruby-style API, it provides full implementations of
XPath and SAX2. It was developed and is maintained by Sean
Chittenden. Sean says he wrote REXML because, at the
time, there were only two choices for XML parsing with Ruby.
One was a binding to a native C parser, a possible
limitation on portability. The other was pure Ruby, but
in Sean's view, it lacked a suitable API. Sean was familiar with various
Java XML parsers but disliked their adherence to the W3C's
DOM or the community-driven SAX. The designers of Electric XML offered an
API based on known Java idioms, one that readily would be intuitive to Java
programmers.
</p><p>
Such was the philosophy behind the REXML API; the name stands
for Ruby Electric XML. Not surprisingly, though, the REXML API
moved from the Java-flavored original to a Ruby-way design,
allowing developers to access and manipulate XML using the
syntax and features, such as blocks and built-in iterators,
common to Ruby.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a8f580.0x2b88318"></a>
The REXML API</h2></div></div><p>
The REXML tree parser easily lets one load XML documents:

<pre     class="programlisting">
require "rexml/document"
file = File.new( "som_xml_file.xml" )
doc = REXML::Document.new file
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a8f580.0x2b88478"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or:

<pre     class="programlisting">

require "rexml/document"
my_xml_string = "&lt;sample&gt;
   &lt;text&gt;This is my REXML doc&lt;/text&gt;
   &lt;/sample&gt;"
doc = REXML::Document.new my_xml_string

</pre>
</p><p>
The Document constructor takes either a string or an I/O object;
REXML figures out which it is and does the right thing. Once you
have a document, you can locate elements using Ruby's Array
and each syntax combined with an XPath selector:

<pre     class="programlisting">
my_xpath = "sample/text"
doc.elements.each( my_xpath ){
    |el| puts el.text }
</pre>
</p><p>
In the above example, the each method iterates over each element
matched by the XPath selector. A code block (the part inside
the { ... }) is called for each iteration. The variable el is
the current element in the iteration, so this example simply
prints the text for each element matched by the XPath.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a8f580.0x2b886e0"></a>
XPath</h2></div></div><p>
Our sample Writer document and its corresponding XML is
quite simple, so finding what we want is close to trivial.
It wouldn't take much to figure out the right element for
particular content. A simple example can be best for articles
such as this, but in real life we aren't likely to
see anything that basic. We may know only limited
details of the markup, such as the style attributes or a parent
element. Finding such content becomes more of a challenge, but XPath helps save the day.
</p><p>
XPath is a W3C recommendation for addressing parts of an XML
document. It allows one to construct a path specifier that defines
location based on element and attribute names and content,
plus relative or absolute positioning. Given a complex
XML document, you can define an XPath expression that locates,
for example, all text:p elements that are
immediate children of the office:body element with this
expression:

<pre     class="programlisting">
*/office:body/text:p
</pre>
</p><p>
The leading asterisk says (in XPath-speak) to follow any path
through the XML document tree that leads to a text:p element
that is the child of an office:body element. With REXML, we
can use this XPath to retrieve and iterate over a collection
of matching elements:

<pre     class="programlisting">
xml.each_element( */office:body/text:p" ) do |el|
   # do something with el, such as
   # look for content or a style attribute
end
</pre>
</p><p>
In this example, the code between do and end is a block. It is
like an anonymous function that gets called for each item in
the collection&mdash;in this case, each element matching the
XPath&mdash;where the item is passed in as an argument, indicated by the
two vertical bars just after &ldquo;do&rdquo;.
This is essentially how OOoExtract works, but you should
visit the OOoExtract home page for details on the numerous command-line
parameters.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a8f580.0x2b889f8"></a>
Toward a More General OOo API</h2></div></div><p>
Having seen OOoExtract, I wanted to have a more general-purpose
OOo object for Ruby. The same basic ideas that drive OOoExtract
could allow not only reading data, but creating, updating
and deleting, for example, the CRUD operations we know and love from
database tools.
To this end, a project named OOo4R has been created on RubyForge, the
Ruby software CVS repository. The design goals are simple
access to data and metadata, transparent use of XPath and
an intuitive API for doing the commonplace, such as adding
paragraphs, headings and styles.
Space does not allow a complete walk-though of all such
features, but we can look at accessing document metadata to
see one way of using Ruby's dynamic message handling to extract
element content.
</p><p>
Earlier we saw that an OOo document has several XML files
packaged in a single zip file. We looked at the content.xml
file; another is meta.xml. It holds information about
the document itself, such as the document title, the
creation date and the word count. The root element is
office:document-meta. This, in turn, contains an office:meta
element that holds numerous child elements with the data
of interest. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;meta:initial-creator&gt;James Britt
&lt;/meta:initial-creator&gt;
&lt;meta:creation-date&gt;2003-11-25T17:36:31
&lt;/meta:creation-date&gt;
&lt;dc:creator&gt;James Britt&lt;/dc:creator&gt;
&lt;dc:date&gt;2003-11-25T18:40:59&lt;/dc:date&gt;
&lt;dc:language&gt;en-US&lt;/dc:language&gt;
&lt;meta:editing-cycles&gt;13&lt;/meta:editing-cycles&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a8f580.0x2b88bb0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The full metadata file is available from the
<i  >Linux Journal</i> FTP site [<a href="../listings/119/7236.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue119/7236.tgz</a>].
</p><p>
In addition to a main Document class, OOo4R defines a meta
class to encapsulate the metadata. A meta class uses an REXML
document to hold the contents of meta.xml. A meta object
largely is a collection of attributes. Typical usage either would be
asking an object for a particular value, such as the
name of the author, or assigning a value, such as a new title.
One way to code this would be to write a series of explicit
attribute accessor methods. We would need two methods for
every attribute. Or, we could use dynamic method invocation by
grabbing accessor messages, finding a matching meta attribute
and either performing the requested action on the corresponding
attribute or raising an exception.
</p><p>
The following code example focuses on the Dublin Core
metadata elements used in OOo. The Dublin Core Metadata
Initiative is an open forum for defining metadata standards. Dublin
Core elements often can be found in RSS feeds and some XHTML
documents. As with all elements in an OpenOffice.org XML file,
the elements have a namespace prefix. Rather than have users
know and use these prefixes, we can map the full element name
to something friendly.
</p><p>
The definition of the Meta class begins with the creation of a hash that maps
friendly names to actual element names, plus a class constant
to hold the base XPath for the metadata. The class constructor
simply creates an REXML document from the XML source:

<pre     class="programlisting">

module OOo
  class Meta

  NAME_MAP = {
   'description' =&gt; 'dc:description',
   'subject'     =&gt; 'dc:subject',
   'creator'     =&gt; 'dc:creator',
   'author '     =&gt; 'dc:creator',
   'date'        =&gt; 'dc:date',
   'language'    =&gt; 'dc:language',
   'title'       =&gt; 'dc:title'
  }
    XPATH_BASE  = "*/office:meta"

    def initialize( src )
      @doc = REXML::Document.new(  src.to_s )
    end

</pre>
</p><p>
We can redefine the method_missing method available to all
Ruby classes so that, rather than raising an exception (as it
would do by default), it looks to see if the message sent to
the object maps to some item in our metadata:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def method_missing( name, *args )
  n = name.to_s
  if is_assignment? n
    el = map_for_assignment n
    xpath = "#{XPATH_BASE}/#{el}"
    assign( xpath, *args)
  else
    el = Meta.map_name n
    xpath = "#{XPATH_BASE}/#{el}"
    find( xpath  )
  end
end
</pre>
</p><p>
The first argument to method_missing is a symbol object, so
our code grabs the string representation. The is_assignment
method simply checks if the name ends with an = character.
If this is an assignment request, then map_for_assignment
removes any trailing characters following the metadata name and
maps the friendly name to the actual Dublin Core element name;
assign updates the corresponding element in the REXML document:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def assign( xpath, val )
  node = @doc.elements.to_a( xpath )[0]
  node.text = val
end
</pre>
</p><p>
If this does not appear to be an assignment, the code
tries to read some metadata. As before, the name is mapped,
but now the code calls find:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def find( xpath )
 begin
  return @doc.elements.to_a( xpath.to_s )[0].text
 rescue Exception
  raise OOo::OOoException.new(
     "Error with xpath '#{xpath}': #{$!}", $@ )
 end
end

# Helper methods omitted ...

 end
end
</pre>
</p><p>
The technique works for accessing the other metadata elements, though there are special cases where the metadata is contained
in a series of child elements. Updating the zip file contents
and writing the zip file back to disk using Ruby's built-in Zip class, lets us save modified
OOo documents.

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
Because the OpenOffice.org file format uses a fully documented
XML format, OOo files may be created or manipulated without
requiring OOo itself. Ruby's built-in XML handling
and dynamic nature make it a natural fit for OOo tasks.
