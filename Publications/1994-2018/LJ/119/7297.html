Agata is a PHP application that runs directly in PHP, not in
a Web server. Why? I have no idea,
but it works. And, if you need something that resembles
(so I'm told) Crystal Reports in Windows, take a look
at Agata. It can be used against most SQL databases,
although I tested it only against PostgreSQL. Agata is easy to
install and run and is extremely flexible. It is also pretty
and does graphs. Requires: PHP and php-gtk.

Many years ago in college I had a completely programmable
calculator. Last time I saw it, the calculator was covered with dust
and I couldn't find a battery for it, so I started using
spreadsheets. Now, it looks like I can have a calculator
again whenever I want it, at least on the computer screen.
Archimede has functions for nearly everything including financial
calculations, trigonometric and math functions as well as calendar
functions. Requires: libX11, libpthread, libdl and glibc.

For several 2.6 test releases, <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> had been
hinting that a handoff to <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span> was imminent. In
fact, as of 2.6.0-test11, it's official. Andrew is now the
2.6 maintainer, even before the official 2.6.0 kernel is
released. An interesting facet of this is that the 2.6.0
release is a major event, and Linus is giving Andrew the
spotlight. This fits neatly with Linus'
response to statements that he is indispensable. Linus
always has maintained that he is &ldquo;just another developer&rdquo; and not
the absolute focal point folks have made him out to be
in the past. By stepping aside,
Linus may be trying to minimize his public role.
</p><p>
In theory, the purpose of the stable kernel series is to
approach true stability gradually. In practice, features
from the ongoing development series are often back-ported
to the stable series, after some testing. In some cases,
the development work is done directly in the stable series,
if the changes are isolated clearly and unlikely to
cause problems outside of their own small realm. But in
general, the ultimate aim of pure stability tends to grow
stronger and stronger. And now, with the handoff of the 2.6
tree to Andrew Morton, <span   class="bold"><b>Marcelo Tossatti</b></span> has decided to clamp
down on new features going into the 2.4 tree, and aside from a few
possible exceptions like <span   class="bold"><b>XFS</b></span> support, 2.4
quickly is becoming a
&ldquo;bug-fix and security-fix only&rdquo; tree.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Pontus Fuchs</b></span> is working on what to some might
seem a radical concept. He is attempting to get certain
Microsoft Windows drivers to work with the
Linux kernel. Considering that the drivers were written for
a completely different operating system, he's actually had a
surprising amount of success with this project. Specifically,
certain <span   class="bold"><b>wireless LAN</b></span> cards have no published specifications or Linux
drivers, either free software or binary-only. So far, he's
been able to use his Broadcom 4301 successfully, and <span   class="bold"><b>Pavel
Machek</b></span> has gotten a Broadcom 94306 working as well.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Carl-Daniel Hailfinger</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>Manfred Spraul</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>Andrew de Quincey</b></span> have reverse engineered the nvnet
driver for the NVIDIA nForce MCP Ethernet adapter and written
their own GPLed driver. Actually, to preserve a clean-room
development environment that would preclude the possibility that
any part of NVIDIA's driver would be copied into their GPLed
version, Carl-Daniel and Andrew did the reverse engineering
and documented the hardware, while Manfred wrote the new
driver from their specifications. In this way, Manfred was
guaranteed to have no direct knowledge of the internals of
the original driver. Reverse engineering is a time-honored
computer-science technique to achieve interoperability,
although there is a strong movement to make certain kinds
of reverse engineering illegal in many countries. The DMCA
(Digital Millennium Copyright Act) is an example of legislation
that attempts to control reverse engineering, but what its
true impact will be is still being hashed out in the courts.
</p><p>
Some <span   class="bold"><b>signal handling</b></span> behavior has changed between kernel 2.4
and 2.6. Typically, there are some signals (called thread-synchronous signals) that threads are unable to block. In the
2.4 kernel, a thread attempting to block one of these signals
would fail, and the signal would come through anyway. This
is not necessarily the most desirable behavior, because there
is no legitimate reason for a thread to try to block one of
these unblockable signals. In the 2.6 kernel, therefore, when
a thread tries to block a thread-synchronous signal, it
dies. So the programmer sees right away that something
was done that shouldn't have been done. Linus says the new
way is the best way, but of course, many past &ldquo;best ways&rdquo;
have led to even better ways. The same may happen here.

In democracies, the most interesting politics are the kind
you can describe with sports metaphors. That's even true when
the big story is about technology. This is what we see in Molly
Ivins' line, &ldquo;the Internet is to politics what television was
in the 1960 Kennedy-Nixon race&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Yet democracy isn't only about elections. It's also about
governance. And that's where Linux and open source
quietly have been making huge changes over the last year or
so. Here's a list of four related initiatives that
radically are changing the rules and methods of technology
procurement and implementation in government:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The Open Source Software Institute (OSSI, <a href="http://oss-institute.org" target="_self">oss-institute.org</a>) is on a mission &ldquo;to promote the
development and implementation of open-source software solutions
within US federal and state government agencies and academic
entities&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
OSSI is working on a US National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) validation for OpenSSL,
the robust, commercial-grade, full-featured and open-source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL
v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols
(<a href="http://oss-institute.org/fips-faq.html" target="_self">oss-institute.org/fips-faq.html</a>).
</p></li><li><p>
Project Leopard (<a href="http://leopard.sourceforge.net" target="_self">leopard.sourceforge.net</a>)
is an &ldquo;eGovernment Web services
platform based on LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python)&rdquo;.
Project founder and <i  >Linux Journal</i> contributor Tom Adelstein says
Leopard is a huge time and hassle saver. &ldquo;All you have to do is
write to this module installer that we have. So, you basically
can do the Web pages and database schema and you're done.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
The Open Government Interoperability Project (<a href="http://ogip.org" target="_self">ogip.org</a>)
produced Project Leopard and is working
on the Open Government Interoperability Standard (OGIS), &ldquo;an
initiative to develop an open specification for ensuring that
governments and administrative software applications work together
more effectively&rdquo;.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
&ldquo;These efforts are still new&rdquo;, says Tom, &ldquo;but already there is a
rewarding sense that their implementation is inevitable. The cost is so
low, and the rewards so high.&rdquo;

Future wide-scale implementations of Linux-based, mission-critical
business applications may get less press, but they will continue to
happen at all of the largest global financial institutions....Critical
to this migration will be the ongoing support of the large hardware
vendors, especially their ability to provide support tools and services
for porting and new development. We believe that within the next 18&ndash;24
months, installing a Linux-based software package will become as normal
as installing a Windows or Sun Solaris system.

There are no good excuses for binary modules. Some of them may
be technically legal (by virtue of not being derived works)
and allowed, but even when they are legal they are a major
pain in the ass, and always horribly buggy.
</p><p>
I occasionally get a few complaints from vendors
over my non-interest in even <span   class="emphasis"><em>trying</em></span> to help binary
modules. Tough. It's a two-way street: if you don't help me,
I don't help you. Binary-only modules do not help Linux,
quite the reverse. As such, we should have no incentives to
help make them any more common than they already are.

If you don't remember all the DNS RFCs, or if parts you should
know slip your mind, use ZoneCheck to look over your name
server zone files to see whether you've maintained your zone as the
RFCs suggest. I had forgotten, for example, that the expire
time must be seven times greater than the refresh. I had only four
times on my zone when I checked. Some 105 different checks
are applied. It can be run from the Web or the command line.
Requires: Ruby, Ruby extensions yaml, exml and a Web server that supports CGI
(optional).
