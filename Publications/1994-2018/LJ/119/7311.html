On topics of open source and government involvement, it's
seemingly impossible to remove political interests from the
decision-making process. As more and more issues involving
Linux/open-source/free software and government usage/control are arising
these days, our Web site has taken on the task of reporting on some of
them.
</p><p><i  >Linux Journal</i> Editor in Chief Don Marti recently posted the text of his
&ldquo;Letter to the US Department of Commerce on Exporting Linux to
Iraq&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7318" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7318</a>). Drafted as a pro bono project
by attorneys Roszel Thomsen and Toni Paytas of Thomsen and Burke LLP,
Don's letter asks that, in matters of distribution to Iraq, Linux
and other open-source software be treated the same as proprietary
software: &ldquo;It is important to note that
proprietary operating system software such as Microsoft Windows and
Sun Solaris have been classified as mass-market encryption products
and are eligible for export under ECCN 5D992. These products may
be exported to Iraq without a license....It is incongruous that
publicly available software such as Linux has more restrictions
than proprietary operating system software.&rdquo; </p><p>Adam Davidson's &ldquo;Followup with the
LUG of Iraq&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7320" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7320</a>) outlines the current
status of software licensing and open-source software in Iraq. A US radio
correspondent in Baghdad, Davidson met with the two-person Iraq Linux
Users Group to discuss their plan to establish a Linux Center to spread
knowledge and encourage use of open-source software. This is a critical
time for Iraq, as the country is in the process of enacting new
licensing regulations that will affect software. Davidson writes,
&ldquo;Iraq's basic laws are being rewritten right now, largely with the help
of US government advisors. And, without counter-advocacy,
it seems all but certain that Iraq will soon have some of the
strictest DMCA-like codes in the world.&rdquo; The Iraq LUG is asking for
the aid of the worldwide Linux community to help them establish
alternatives in the rebuilding of the country. Read Davidson's article to see
what you can do.

Back in the US, Alan McConnell wrote &ldquo;Linux for
Congress&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7249" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7249</a>) about the newly formed
Linux-Public Education (Linux-PE) mailing list. Linux-PE is intended
to serve as both a discussion list and &ldquo;a meeting place for Linux
activists who wish to organize to get their favorite OS into
governments&rdquo;. The project that inspired Linux-PE is a campaign to port
to Linux the client software that connects congressional offices to the
outside world.

On a lighter note, Doc Searls did some research on what's running the
Web sites of 2004 presidential hopefuls.
President Bush's site is using Microsoft IIS on Windows 2000, and so are
Democratic candidates Edwards and Gephardt. But the most popular choice is Apache running on
either Linux or FreeBSD. Check out &ldquo;Penguins for President?&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7249" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7249</a>) for more details, including runtime
statistics.

Finally,
we're pleased to announce that Dave Phillips recently signed
on to write a monthly Web column for the <i  >Linux Journal</i> site that will cover issues and news surrounding
Linux audio development. &ldquo;Linux: It Sounds Good to
Me&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7283" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7283</a>), outlines what he plans to cover
in the column and discusses three key sources for Linux audio
enthusiasts&mdash;the LAD, LAU and LAA mailing lists.
