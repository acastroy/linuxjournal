Tcl/Tk may not look very modern, but it has handy features such
as variables that automatically take on the value of a widget.
Tcl/Tk remains the tool of choice for many script writers.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2398580.0x2490298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Although many Linux developers are only now
discovering the combination of a scripting
language and a graphical user interface (GUI)
toolkit, this sort of development environment is
not new. The largely unsung forerunner to projects
like PyQt and pyGTK is Tcl/Tk, the first
footprints of which can be traced back to before
Linux even was created. Supported by an
enthusiastic community, Tcl/Tk quietly
and efficiently has been providing cross-platform GUI
scripting to UNIX, Windows and Macintosh developers for
many years.
</p><p>
The language itself currently is up to version
8.4.5.0, and the Tcl/Tk application development
tool of choice, Visual Tcl, recently has been
updated to version 1.6 after two years of
development. This article looks at the language,
toolkit and Visual Tcl and describes how they can be
used to produce a neat solution to a real
requirement.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2398580.0x24903f8"></a>
An Overview of Tcl/Tk</h2></div></div><p>
Although somewhat trampled in the stampede script
writers made toward Perl when a scripting
language was required to drive the emerging
Internet, Tcl still is a technical match for Perl,
Python or any other comparable language. Often
described as the best kept secret of the
Internet, it is a free (in all the best senses of
the word), full-featured language driven by a byte
code compiler that produces performance on a par
with any of its peers. It is used in all the
places other scripting languages are used: system
administration, task automation, server back ends
and, as we shall see shortly, application
development.
</p><p>
As a programming language, Tcl is exceptionally
easy to learn. In contrast to the complicated
feature sets and syntaxes of Python and Perl, Tcl
is procedural and straightforward in nature. The entire syntax is described in
exactly 11 rules, from which the whole language is
built. Ironically, it's this simplicity that
sometimes confuses people who are new to Tcl.
An experienced programmer can learn to read Tcl
scripts in ten minutes and write them inside an
hour. A beginner doesn't take much longer.
</p><p>
Documentation is top rate, coming in the form of
comprehensive and well written man pages. A
complete HTML package of the documentation also is
available. If man pages are a little intimidating
for the new user, a decent selection of books
exist for Tcl/Tk, the pick of which probably is Brent
Welch's recently updated <span   class="emphasis"><em>Practical Programming in
Tcl and Tk</em></span> from Prentice-Hall PTR. Also worth a
mention is the Tcler's Wiki, which is one of the
largest and best supported wikis anywhere on the
Internet.
</p><p>
Tcl philosophy centers on one idea: it's an
extendable language. Most languages allow a
developer to write functions and procedures, but
Tcl goes much further. Tcl allows
developers to extend the entire language with new
commands and functionality, up to and including
adding fundamental language structures such as
object orientation. The Tk toolkit actually is
another optional extension to the Tcl
language, which happens to provide a whole set of
Tcl commands to create, drive and control GUI
widgets. Like dozens of other extensions, Tk has
long been included in the Tcl core distribution
and now is seen more as a part of the language
than an extension of it.

The Project</h2></div></div><p>
In order to test-drive the latest versions of
Tcl/Tk and Visual Tcl, I needed a small project to
develop. A personal requirement provided just the
thing. Since getting a digital camera, I've often
wanted to throw a couple of pictures onto
a Web page quickly so that friends and family could
see them. A full-blown Web gallery
application would be overkill; I need only the
ability to select one or two image files, add a
few lines of text and then have a single Web page
appear that I can upload to a Web server. Figure
1 shows an example of the sort of page I would
like to be able to produce.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7225f1.large.jpg"><img src="7225f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The task is to produce simple Web pages containing images
and a small amount of text quickly, like this one.
</p></div></div><p>
This sort of project is an ideal candidate for a
GUI-based script. It's a fairly simple task that
isn't dependent on speed but that clearly
benefits from having a graphical user
interface. The function of the GUI is simple:
present users with an interface where they
select some image files, viewing them if
necessary, and collect a few lines of accompanying
text. The script then can use a standard tool to
produce the HTML page. In this case, that tool is
the XSLT processor from the libxml2 package found
on almost every modern Linux system.
</p><p>
The rest of this article looks at how the
combination of Tcl/Tk and Visual Tcl were used to
develop this little application rapidly. Figure 2
shows the final script in action; the code can be
downloaded from the link provided at the end of this
article.

Getting the Software</h2></div></div><p>
Most Linux distributions come with
Tcl/Tk. However, I always install and use the
latest version of ActiveTcl from ActiveState,
Inc. Apart from being up to date and
professionally presented, it provides a standard
Tcl package with a lot of useful extensions. If you
know your users are using ActiveTcl, you know
exactly which extensions they have on their
machine and therefore can guarantee your script
can run. I encourage anyone who wants to run the
project in this article to download and install
ActiveTcl-8.4.5.0 or later, as that's what I
used for development. ActiveTcl comes with its own
installer, and if you install it in, for example,
/opt/ActiveTcl-8.4.5.0, it doesn't interfere with
any existing Tcl/Tk installation. If you already
have a Tcl/Tk package in /usr/bin, ensure you set
an early entry in your user account's PATH to
point to the ActiveTcl bin directory.
</p><p>
Visual Tcl is available from SourceForge and also
comes with its own installer. Many Linux
distributions include it, but make sure you have the
latest version.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2398580.0x2490ce8"></a>Developing a Tcl/Tk Script</h2></div></div><p>
A common approach to Tcl/Tk scripting is to start
by designing the GUI. This process allows the
developer to think through all the features
the application requires, and it produces a solid
framework on which those features can be built.
When things start getting complicated, this
approach breaks down and something more formal,
like a Model, View, Controller pattern, is
required. But for small applications, such as my Web page,
or for rapid prototyping, getting a GUI together
is a good starting point. So I'll start with
Visual Tcl.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2398580.0x2490df0"></a>
A Look at Visual Tcl</h2></div></div><p>
The days when developers would sit at a text
editor manually arranging buttons, listboxes and
other widgets by brain power alone are pretty much
gone. This is the sort of job that should be
done with a graphical tool. Dragging and dropping
widgets makes development much quicker, especially
for beginners.
</p><p>
Visual Tcl provides exactly these sorts of
facilities and then some. In fact, it doesn't
seem too sure whether to behave like a cut-down
integrated development environment (IDE).
It occasionally offers a text editing window
where the user can write the Tcl code that forms
the actual application, rather than limiting
itself to dealing with the development of the
GUI. On the other hand, it doesn't offer a debugger
or other traditional IDE features, so it's
difficult to justify calling it a real IDE.
I dealt with this confusion of personality by
going into the configuration dialog for the
application and switching off many of the
features that seem to get in my way
(Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7225f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Visual Tcl is highly configurable.
</p></div></div><p>
Instead I chose to write the bulk of the
application logic in my favoured environment
(XEmacs) and simply used the output from Visual Tcl
as a library that creates the GUI for my
script. Credit goes to Visual Tcl for being
flexible enough to be used in the way of my
choosing. Listing 1 shows my wrapper script,
which is the starting point for the application
code itself.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2398580.0x2491160"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. A simple wrapper to keep the Visual Tcl code (in gui.tcl)
separate from the main script. The #! line weirdness is a
common way of starting a Tcl/Tk script.</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

# the next line restarts using wish \

#

# Load and run the GUI code created by Visual Tcl
#
source gui.tcl

#
# Any "post-gui" code I need can go here
#

</pre></div><p>
Once I understood the way I wanted to
work with the tool, it didn't take too long to
produce the output I wanted. Widgets are placed
using a simple point-and-click interface, and a
separate Attribute Editor window allows for the
fine detail of widget behavior to be tweaked and
fiddled with to the heart's content. Tk widget
layout devices also are easy to control when you
understand them. Figure 4 shows the Visual Tcl
development environment.

Figure 4. Visual Tcl appears rather cluttered even on a large screen. It's
not too hard to use though.
</p></div></div><p>
Visual Tcl produces executable Tcl/Tk code, which
is loaded and edited directly. The routines that
load the Tcl/Tk code are surprisingly tolerant,
which means the generated code can be
edited and tuned independently by the developer
before being returned to Visual Tcl for further
work.
</p><p>
Visual Tcl's biggest problem is the dated nature
of the toolkit behind it. Tcl/Tk offers only the
basic building blocks of widgets. Things like
comboboxes and notebooks aren't available in
Tk. Fortunately, a number of extensions
to Tcl/Tk provide these mega widgets, and
Visual Tcl supports them all. The drawback
is that for the final script to run
correctly, the target machine needs the mega
widget extensions installed. For this project I
made use of the incr tcl widget set, and the
Tcl/Tk installed as part of most Linux
distributions may not contain this set. Hence my
recommendation of the ActiveTcl Tcl/Tk
distribution. In fact, my SuSE 8.1 system does
include incr tcl but strangely doesn't include
the extension required to load JPEG images&mdash;a
rather glaring omission on the part of SuSE I'd
have thought.
</p><p>
Anyone who has used a really slick GUI builder
tool like the excellent Qt Designer can tell you
that Visual Tcl needs more work. It's slow on my
dual PIII-500 machine to the point of being irritating,
and it has more than its share of usability issues
and bugs, although these should be cleared up in
the point-one release. The bottom line, though, is
Visual Tcl did the job I required. The
script it generates is readable enough to be fine-tuned by hand, and anything the code does can be
overridden by more specific code in the main
application. My GUI completed, I moved on to the
application development side of the project.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2398580.0x24916e0"></a>
Building the Application</h2></div></div><p>
The thing that sets Tcl apart from more
modern GUI scripting solutions is the way the Tk
toolkit interacts with the Tcl code that does the
work. Packages such as GTK or Qt are low-level
libraries, written in C or C++. The script-level
bindings to them work well enough, but there's
always a big step down from the scripting language
into the API of the GUI toolkit. Developers
really need to understand the widgets with which they're
working and must know how to configure and
interrogate them using low-level calls directly to
the widgets themselves.
</p><p>
The relationship between Tcl and Tk is much more
of a peer-to-peer nature. The GUI toolkit operates at the same
level as the language driving it, which makes the
combination easy to work with.
Take, for example, the listbox widget that
contains the list of images to put in the Web
page. In Visual Tcl, an attribute of the listbox
widget, called the listvar, is presented, and I
set it to a variable called
::imageList. ::imageList is a list variable in
my Tcl code, and Tcl/Tk ensures that its contents
always are reflected in the listbox widget. If I
add, move or delete an item in that list variable,
the contents of the listbox widget are updated immediately
and automatically to display its
contents. The code that handles the image list
doesn't access or interact with the GUI at all. It
simply keeps a single list variable in the correct
state, safe in the knowledge that Tcl/Tk
does the rest. Figure 5 shows this relationship.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7225f5.large.jpg"><img src="7225f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Setting the listvar attribute in Visual Tcl (left) ensures the
generated code (middle) causes the onscreen widget (right) to respond
immediately to any changes made in the named variable.
</p></div></div><p>
More direct access to the widgets sometimes
is required. Under these circumstances, Visual Tcl
makes use of aliasing. In Tcl/Tk, the name of a
widget depends on where it is in the widget
tree. That name changes as container widgets,
such as frames, are added and removed. To prevent the
script writer from having to keep track of the full
names of the important widgets, Visual Tcl allows
the user to specify an alias&mdash;a short,
easily memorable name by which the widget always is known. These short names can be looked up in a global
associative array (also known as a hash or
dictionary), so access to the widgets, wherever
they might end up, always is easy. For example, I
gave the Introduction text widget the alias
IntroText. To fetch the text currently in
that widget, the code in Listing 2 can be used.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2398580.0x2491a50"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. Fetching the Contents of an Aliased Widget</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
...
set introWidget $::widget(IntroText)
set text [$introWidget get 1.0 end]
...
</pre></div><p>
The ::widget array is provided automatically by
the Visual Tcl generated code, so fetching the
real name of the text widget is simple. Asking the
widget to provide its current text, from line 1
character 0 to the end, also is easy.
</p><p>
The image display in the viewer window actually is
a label widget in the center of the
dialog. Tk can load an image from disk and create
a pixmap from it with one line of code. When the
user selects a new image file, a pixmap is created
from it and a single command is used to set the
label widget to show that image (Listing 3).
In the actual script, I store the loaded pixmaps in
a cache. This makes switching from one image to
another and back again much sharper.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2398580.0x24885a0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 3. The image is loaded from the disk, and then the label widget is
configured to show that image (Tk labels show images as well as text).
The image appears on screen immediately.</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
...
set loadedImage [image create photo -file $filename]
$::widget(ImageLabel) configure -image $loadedImage
...
</pre></div><p>
When the user clicks the Publish button, a Tcl
function is called that creates the Web page. The
workings of this code aren't especially relevant
here. Suffice it to say that Tcl allows generation of
an XML DOM using the TclXML extension and then allows
the callout to the libxml2 XSLT processor, which
generates the HTML. Getting a specialist package
to do the hard work is, of course, the ace up the
script writer's sleeve.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2398580.0x2488808"></a>
The Shortcomings of Tcl/Tk</h2></div></div><p>
Although the Tcl/Tk script works nicely, it's hard to
ignore the obvious gulf in quality between the
appearance of a Tcl/Tk script and a more
modern Qt or GTK one. Qt and GTK-based
programs look much sharper than those using the
Motif style of Tk widgets, plus they are
themeable, whereas Tk isn't. Also compare built-in features, such as the
file selector dialog&mdash;Tk's is no better than GTK's, and both are
embarrassed by Qt's. Work continues in the Tcl
community regarding these sorts of issues, but as
with many mature technologies, improvements are
slow in coming for fear of breaking existing code.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2398580.0x2488910"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Tcl/Tk is the oldest of the GUI-enabled scripting
languages in common use today, but it doesn't
enjoy the monopoly position it used to have. Python,
coupled with GTK or Qt, now provides a more
contemporary solution to many of the problems
for which Tcl/Tk used to be the natural choice. Both
Tcl/Tk and Visual Tcl have some ground to make up
in terms of looks, features and desktop
integration.
Yet, the simplicity of application development
offered by the mature and superbly integrated
combination of the Tcl language and the Tk toolkit
still is second to none. If you have a simple
scripting task that would benefit from a GUI,
where speed and cost of development are important,
Tcl/Tk still should be near the top of the
list of contenders for the job.
