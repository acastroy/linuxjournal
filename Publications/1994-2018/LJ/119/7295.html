Build big scenic images from your small snapshots using
this easy plugin for The GIMP.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca7580.0xd9f240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Panoramic landscapes make for some amazing photos. There's nothing like
the feeling of relaxation and tranquility gained by gazing over the vivid
images of sweeping wilderness, minus the hassle of actually getting
there. Using a digital camera, it's possible to stitch photos together to
simulate the expensive effects of a landscape filter. After I'd bought my
digital camera (a Nikon Coolpix 4300) and set it up to work under Linux,
getting software to stitch photos together was my next task.
</p><p>
The Nikon Coolpix 4300, like most digital cameras, comes with software
on CD to perform rudimentary photo-stitching. Unfortunately, the software
is not for Linux.
Using Google, it was hard to find anything that would do the job
under Linux, until I remembered The GIMP. There are two ways to use
The GIMP to create a panoramic photo, easy and hard. The hard way is to
set up layers out of the different photos, edit filter and layer masks,
mess about with transparency and layer them together, manually.
</p><p>
The easy way is to use Pandora.
Pandora is a plugin for The GIMP that takes photos and tries to
match the edges of the photos together, using a best guess at where
one photo ends and the next begins.

consistency of the light has made this an easy set of photos to stitch
together.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca7580.0xd9f5b0"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Because Pandora is a GIMP plugin, to install it, you need
The GIMP version 1.2 or 1.3, as well as Gimptool, which is provided in The
GIMP development package. Untar Pandora to a working directory,
<tt  >cd</tt> into
it, and run <tt  >make</tt>. Pandora detects which version of
The GIMP is available
and installs it automatically.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca7580.0xd9f768"></a>
Using Pandora</h2></div></div><p>
Fire up The GIMP. Pandora should now be available under the Extensions
(Xtns) menu as Make Panorama. Select the photos you want to stitch
together and click the Add File button; under The GIMP 1.2, you need to add
the photos individually, as they should
appear from left to right. It's possible to create vertical panoramas, but
you need to make use of the rotate feature, as Pandora works
horizontally.

</p></div></div><p>
Pandora can be set with some options before it does its work. The option to
feather
the layers creates a fade toward the edge of the photos,
where the photo becomes slightly translucent. Keep it toggled to create
a semi-transparent fade at the sides of each photo, making them easier
to line up.
</p><p>
Related to feathering is overlap.
Often, photos have minor differences in
sky colour; overlap helps to blend the difference so it isn't noticeable.
The higher the overlap, the further in from the edge of the photo the
feathering takes effect.
</p><p>
Once you're happy with your choices, click OK and Pandora starts to
perform its magic.
</p><p>
When the processing has finished, you are presented with a set of layers,
one for each original photo. The layers, represented with a dotted line at
the edge, should be lined up roughly to what Pandora thinks are the common
portions of each picture. Because Pandora is mostly a means of automating
the layer creation and feathering, your panorama likely may require
a bit more work before you can start impressing your friends.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7295f3.large.jpg"><img src="7295f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The selected layer is highlighted, and we can move it using the
Move layers tool (selected).
</p></div></div><p>
Using the Move layers and selections tool (represented by the
four-directional arrow), you can select a layer and move it, by holding
the left mouse button down while moving the mouse.
The easiest way to line the images up is to find a common landmark at
the edge of each photo&mdash;mountains or trees are ideal&mdash;and use these
as the anchor around which the images are aligned.
</p><p>
Once the layers are lined up to your satisfaction, you may notice
that the pictures have moved out of their perfect vertical alignment,
resulting in a jagged top and bottom edge.
</p><p>
Right-click in the image window, and choose Layers&rarr;Flatten Image. This
merges the layers into one. If you haven't finished lining
up the edges, you can undo this last action. Now, using the Select
rectangular regions tool, select a region from the bottom left corner
to the top right, ignoring all white space caused by the jagged edges
mentioned earlier. Copy into a new image, save and you're done.

Your Mileage May Vary</h2></div></div><p>
Obviously, Pandora can't cope well in every circumstance. Different amounts
of light between photos, particularly when your photos include sky or
water, make it difficult to create a consistent picture. This is most
notable when shooting toward the sun. Moving subjects, such as cars or
people, can result in the occurrence of ghosted images. Cityscapes containing a
lot of right angles can emerge imperfectly when the angle of each photo
is not perfect. Finally, if the source photos are not ideal, your
results won't be either. A fixed tripod or at least holding the camera
close to you with your elbows against your body gives a standard height
and angle that can make your photos much easier to line up. The better
your source photos, the less effort you need to use in making your
panoramas fantastic.
</p><p>
As with most things, you can find tutorials and hints on creating
panoramas on the Net. By
using Pandora, it's possible for a rank amateur to come up with some
great results, even with a limited knowledge of The GIMP and
layers. The
picture in Figure 4 shows a successful scene, where the sky and water tones
are consistent and the edges are lined up.
