Choosing the right presentation software is only
the beginning of preparing an effective talk. Here's how an
experienced tech speaker uses OpenOffice.org to get the message
across to the audience.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd9580.0x20d13a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
As a Linux techno-guru, you recently have been volunteered to give a talk
at a high-profile industry conference.
Your stomach starts to churn as you realize that you
might have to learn Microsoft PowerPoint.
Oh,
the humiliation!
Fear not,
OpenOffice.org Impress runs on your Linux box.
Think how calm you'll be in front of all those people
knowing that your trusted old friend Linux is right there at the other
end of your wireless mouse.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd9580.0x20d14a8"></a>
It's All Showbiz</h2></div></div><p>
Technical presentations are about transferring knowledge to the
audience. The content is the show, you are the showman and the
presentation technologies are the showbiz tools. Laptops, graphics,
projectors, lights and presentation software all serve to organize the
show and focus audience attention on the content.
</p><p>
As a techie myself, I know that technology is a siren call to be
explored and fiddled with. We have to resist the temptation to tweak
for now, though; we have a show to put on. Here, I
discuss the basics of building a slideshow with OpenOffice.org
Impress and a few ways to get your show organized. Then, I throw in
a few power tips, so you will look like a pro in front of your adoring
audience.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd9580.0x20d1608"></a>
What Is Impress?</h2></div></div><p>
The OpenOffice.org Impress package lets you quickly construct and
deliver an electronic slide presentation. With it, you can add graphics, make
handouts and convert your slides to Web pages. It can do all the jobs
needed to put on a great presentation. You simply add your content and
personal style.
</p><p>
Loading OpenOffice.org Impress onto your Linux machine is simple. You
might have OpenOffice.org already installed. Otherwise, go to <a href="http://www.openoffice.org" target="_self">www.openoffice.org</a> and download the latest version; version 1.1
is around 77MB. The .gz file can be unzipped and put in its own
directory. Then, run the setup file, fill in the blanks and you're ready
to go.
</p><p>
You don't need a 3.0GHz laptop to run Impress. It runs fine on old 166MHz Pentium desktops with an 8MB video card and KDE or FVWM2 X window
managers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd9580.0x20d1818"></a>
Quick Presentation Creation</h2></div></div><p>
Fire up OpenOffice.org Impress and take a spin through the
program. Let's first look at some basic functions and then come back and get our
content organized.
The easiest way to start a new presentation is with the AutoPilot
feature, which provides a basic beginning framework. Graphics,
text, animation and formatting can be added after you enter your content.
</p><p>
To build a presentation, click
File&rarr;New&rarr;Presentation.
In the next window, select Empty Presentation and then click Next.
This next window lets you choose backgrounds. Click Next for a window that
lets you choose slide transitions. Our first
presentation doesn't have any transition effects and is
controlled manually by the Page Up/Page Down keys or the mouse, so click Create.
The Insert Slide window should appear here. It lets you select the slide
layout. For our first sample, use the layout style named Title, Graphic, Text.
Highlight that layout, click OK and watch your first slide appear
(Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7187f1.large.jpg"><img src="7187f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Building a presentation starts with the first slide. Here is the main
Impress window.
</p></div></div><p>
This first slide offers you a place to enter your slide title, a picture on the
left and your bullet points on the right. Using the default font size,
the bullet point area forces you to work with only four or five lines. That's
good because many experienced presenters put too
much information on a slide. Use the slides and bullet points for a
prompt and tell the story in your own words. By doing so, your audience
sees you
as an expert who thoroughly knows the subject.
</p><p>
The exercise of creating the first slide should take about 5&ndash;10
minutes. I intentionally went through the entire process because I wanted to
get you right into the Impress program. Knowing how to build a basic
slide provides you with the understanding necessary to organize your talk and build
subsequent slides.
</p><p>
Forget about outlining your talk on paper; use Impress
itself. Brainstorm your ideas logically, using the titles as main topics,
each topic being a new slide, and put three or four bullet points under each topic for the
details. You can rearrange and edit them after you've
laid out all the material.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd9580.0x20d1c38"></a>
Adding Slides, Text and Graphics</h2></div></div><p>
Adding a slide is easy. Start by clicking
Insert&rarr;Slide.
Select the type of slide and then click OK.
Your slide shows up on the screen, and you can enter text or
whatever you want.
To duplicate the last slide,
click Insert&rarr;Duplicate Slide. Now you're ready to
add some text. Click the Text icon on the
upper-left edge of the main Impress design window.
Move the cursor to the slide and left-click a location. Now,
type in your text. You can move the text to another location by dragging the middle of the
text box.
To resize the text, highlight and choose a new size in the point
size space, at the top of the design window.
</p><p>
Adding graphics is equally as easy. Click Insert&rarr;Graphics, and
select the graphic file to use. Click OK and the file is pulled into the
slide.
Resize the graphic by grabbing a side and moving the edge. To move the
graphic, grab
it in the middle and reposition to the desired location.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd9580.0x20d1d98"></a>
Making Slide Handouts and Notes</h2></div></div><p>
Handouts are groups of slides in a book form, with four slides per page
by default
(Figure 2). When printed, they can be stapled together or put in a binder and given to
audience members before the show. For technical presentations, the
handout allows the audience to take notes on a picture of the slide being
discussed.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7187f2.large.jpg"><img src="7187f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Previewing Handouts, Four per Page
</p></div></div><p>
To create handouts,
switch to Handouts Mode by clicking the Handouts View icon along
the upper right-hand window slidebar.
Print the handouts by clicking File&rarr;Print&rarr;OK.
Your entire presentation is printed with four slides per page.
</p><p>
Presentation notes add information that you or the audience find
useful, but they don't show up when you run the slideshow. Print off a
copy of the notes on paper if you have a big presentation and need
some additional prompting.
</p><p>
To add a note to a slide,
switch to Notes mode by clicking the Note View icon along the
upper right-hand window slidebar.
Select the Click to add notes section at the bottom, and enter
any information you like. The slide then is displayed in the top part of
the view (Figure 3).
Finally, click the Slide View icon (above the Note View icon) to return to
your slide, minus the notes.

Running the Presentation</h2></div></div><p>
Naturally, you'll want to rehearse your masterpiece, once you've
finished it. You always should practice your presentation before the
main event.
Switch to full-screen mode and page through your presentation with the
Page Up/Page Down keys or the mouse buttons. Click the Start Slide Show
icon on the right side of the windows slidebar (below the Note View icon)
to get into Slide Show mode. Press the Esc button to return to the
Impress Drawing View mode.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd9580.0x20d2420"></a>
Converting Slides to Web Pages</h2></div></div><p>
Creating and delivering your presentation to your audience has been
our focus thus far. But, why not provide the slides to your audience on a Web
page (for review later) and look like a real professional speaker? By
directing your audience to your Web pages, you also are able to show
them your company information, your bio, other presentations and whitepapers and Web articles. Nothing makes a speaker more
credible than providing valuable information and services to his or her
audience, even after they leave the talk. That little extra effort of
putting your presentations on your Web site can set you apart from the
small-time tech speaker.
</p><p>
OpenOffice.org Impress makes it easy to set up simple Web pages based on
your slides. Begin by opening
your presentation in Impress, and
click File&rarr;Export.
Select the working directory for the HTML and graphics files.
Next, enter the filename of your main HTML page (without the .html
extension) and click
Export.
On the Assign Design screen, select Next.
On the Publication Type screen, select Next.
On the next screen you can save graphics as JPEGs, so select Resolution
medium&mdash;600&times;800.
Fill in the author, e-mail, home page and information on the
Information On The Title Page screen. Then, select Link to Original
Presentation, and click Next.
Choose the types of buttons you want for navigation around your pages and
click Next.
On the Color Selection screen, select Create.
Finally, you can save the HTML design you
created with a name on the Name HTML design screen. Save it and you're done.
</p><p>
You now have a cool set of basic Web pages that showcase your slides.
The title page carries your name, e-mail, Web site URL and
additional information (Figure 4). There's also a link to the
original Impress presentation.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7187f4.large.jpg"><img src="7187f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The main Web title page includes links to other
relevant information.
</p></div></div><p>
To look at your handiwork, go to the working directory and
open the HTML file that you named when you first exported your
presentation (Slide 1 example&mdash;see Figure 5).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7187f5.large.jpg"><img src="7187f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Previewing the Web Version in a Browser
</p></div></div><p>
Once you're satisfied with the look of the Web pages, upload the whole
directory&mdash;don't forget your original presentation or .sxi file&mdash;to your
main Web site. Add a descriptive link to it from your main page and then give
the URL to your audience. Check the presentation pages on your Web site
after uploading, of course, to make sure everything is there and correct.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd9580.0x20d2a50"></a>
Your Time in the Spotlight</h2></div></div><p>
There are two pre-presentation tasks that you must do to ensure a great
presentation.
You are going to be in front of people because you are the subject-matter
expert, but relax and have fun as an entertainer&mdash;make it enjoyable.
Second, end
your presentation with a call for action, something like &ldquo;Now go try
Impress&rdquo;,
instead of simply saying &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; and smiling at all that thunderous
applause.
</p><p>
Unless you are an extremely experienced speaker, do a full rehearsal
at
least twice before doing your live talk. By rehearsal, I mean set up a room,
your laptop, the projector and go through the whole presentation in real
time. Don't be afraid to use a stopwatch, as you need to be
absolutely sure you can fit your presentation into the allotted
time. You probably will have some editing to do. The best idea is to start putting your show
together as soon as you get the assignment. Nothing messes up a show as
much as going overtime or not covering all your material. Plan
for contingencies; for example, if the previous speaker went long, what will
you do?
</p><p>
Also, arrive early at your venue to set up the equipment and room the
way you want them, and ask the event staff to help you. Test your laptop
with the projector at the venue before the presentation. Finally,
pack everything you think you might need, including transparencies and
extension cords, just in case.

Wrap Up</h2></div></div><p>
Technical presentations can be fun and profitable. Use Impress
on your Linux laptop and enjoy being in the spotlight. Plan ahead, make
sure you rehearse enough and stay on time. Good luck!
