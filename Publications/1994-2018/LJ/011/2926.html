    This month, Mark discusses how to keep track of what is
    happening to (and on) your Linux system.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x151a580.0x16123a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The syslog daemon (known as syslogd) is
used to receive messages from various parts of the Linux (or other
Unix) system and distribute these messages to other locations. This
allows you, the administrator, to review system activities by
keeping a log of what goes on behind the scenes. It's a great way
of tracking down problems and also of reviewing your system
security.
</p><p>For example, you can keep track of serious errors, such as
TCP/IP problems or lack of memory (for when ghostscript and X get a
bit out of hand). At the same time, you can debug that pesky mail
problem that a user is having, or you can keep track of who has
used the su program to assume root status, and you can also find
out who failed trying to do so.</p><p>To get a copy of the syslog program, see the sidebar on
obtaining syslog from an ftp site near you.</p><p>Syslogd has a setup file, called /etc/syslog.conf, which
tells syslogd what messages to log, and what to do with the
messages it receives. By default (i.e., the /etc/syslog.conf file
is empty), messages are not stored anywhere. Most distributions of
Linux have some basic setup of the syslog.conf file included, and
the syslogd program is often started in the /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2
file.</p><p>The setup of your syslog.conf file is in three parts. Let's
look at a sample syslog.conf file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# /etc/syslog.conf
 *.info;*.notice    /usr/adm/messages
 *.debug           /usr/adm/debug
 *.warn            /usr/adm/syslog
</pre><p>The first line is a comment. Any lines starting with # or
completely blank lines are considered comments and are ignored by
syslogd. You can see two columns here, separated by at least one
tab. The left side (the one with *.info;*.notice in it) defines the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>facility</em></span> and the <span   class="emphasis"><em>logging
level</em></span>. The right side defines the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>destination</em></span> of the messages.</p><p>The facility can be defined as the &ldquo;kind&rdquo; of program that is
running. For example, &ldquo;mail&rdquo; is the facility used whether you are
running <b  >sendmail</b> or <b  >smail</b>.
There are nine pre-defined facilities, plus eight facilities that
are locally defined, a &ldquo;wildcard&rdquo; facility that means &ldquo;all
facilities&rdquo; and one facility for issuing timestamps.</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x151a580.0x16128c8"></a><p class="title"><b>Here is what each facility is for:</b></p><table     summary="Here is what each facility is for:" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><p>Facility</p></td><td><p>Used For</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>user</p></td><td><p>user processes</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>kern</p></td><td><p>kernel messages</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>mail</p></td><td><p>mail</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>daemon</p></td><td><p>various daemons (such as ftpd)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>auth</p></td><td><p>authorization (such as login)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>lpr</p></td><td><p>the line printer</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>news</p></td><td><p>USENET news (nntp)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>uucp</p></td><td><p>UUCP (Unix to Unix copy)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>cron</p></td><td><p>the cron daemon</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>mark</p></td><td><p>a periodic message created for placing timestamps in
log files</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>local0-local7</p></td><td><p>locally-defined facilities</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>*</p></td><td><p>all facilities (except mark)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>One special note about the mark facility. This facility is
created by syslogd every twenty minutes at the info level. This
will allow you to quickly see time change in a log file, along with
making sure that syslogd is running (and logging). And as noted
above, the special * facility (which means all the available
facilities) does not include mark.</p><p>Each facility can have a logging (or severity) level to it.
This is used to indicate which types of messages you want to
record. The high severity levels (such as emerg) require the most
attention, as an emerg usually indicates that the program will fail
soon. These severity levels decrease in importance all the way down
to the debug level, which is used for properly setting up your
software. Once your software is configured correctly, you can
change the severity level to a higher one. Check the documentation
on your software for its interpretation of the various levels. From
highest severity to
lowest:emergalertcriterrwarningnoticeinfodebugnone</p><p>The severity of none means that no messages from that
facility are to be recorded. These levels mean that messages of
that level and above are recorded. For example, say you have the
following two lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mail.debug      /var/adm/syslog.mail
mail.emerg      /var/adm/syslog.mail.emerg
</pre><p>When <b  >sendmail</b> (or
<b  >smail</b>), or whatever program is logging as the
mail facility) sends syslog a message with a level of debug, it
gets placed in the syslog.mail file. Any other messages, of any
level from info up to emerg, also get placed in syslog.mail.
Emergency messages from mail get sent to both syslog.mail and to
syslog.mail.emerg. This setup makes it extremely easy to check for
emergency conditions for your software, since a glance at the
directory listing for syslog.mail.emerg will tell you if the file
has changed recently, and you can easily type
<b  >tail/var/adm/syslog.mail.emerg</b> to glance at the
ten most recent entries. In addition, you can find the emergency
message in syslog.mail and see the other messages surrounding it to
determine the events leading up to the emergency message.</p><p>In another example, we can see the use of the &ldquo;none&rdquo; severity
level:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
*.alert;user.none       /var/adm/syslog.alert
user.alert              /var/adm/syslog.user.alert
</pre><p>Here, all messages at alert severity and above are sent to
syslog.alert, <span   class="emphasis"><em>except</em></span> for the ones in the user
facility. Those get sent to the syslog.user.alert file instead, as
specified by the second line.</p><p>Now you are probably wondering about the right hand side of
the lines. By now, you have figured out that this can be the name
of a file. But it can also be the name of a user or of a remote
host. If the intended recipient of the message is a file, the name
of the file must start with a /, indicating that you have to give a
full path for the filename. Note that this can be just about any
file, including /dev/console, which will print the message to the
console of the machine, or /dev/lp2 to print your message on
paper.</p><p>If the recipient is a remote host, it will start with an @
followed by the name of the host. The intended host will receive
the message via TCP/IP port 514, and from this point, it is just
like a message to syslog locally. A message to the remote host must
go through syslog and get logged to the appropriate location. This
will allow you to monitor a network of machines from one location.
You can also include a comma-separated list of users and the
messages will be printed on those users' screens if they are logged
in. You can also include a *, which means that every user that is
logged in gets the message. This is very useful for extreme
emergency conditions where you want the users to realize that
something is very wrong and they should log out.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#Log mail errors to the mail host for
#the postmaster to deal with
mail.*         @mailhost
#Send kernel emergency warnings to all
#users so they know what's up
kern.emerg     *
</pre><p>Once you have your /etc/syslog.conf file set up, you have to
first set up the files that will be storing the messages, then
restart <b  >syslogd</b>.</p><p>Setting your files up for syslog merely means reviewing the
permissions of the log files. By default, files are set up owned by
root, in the root group, readable by everyone, and writable only by
the root user. For a one-user system, this should be fine. But for
a multi-user system, with (possibly) logs of who sent and received
e-mail, many of these files should only be read by the root user. A
good suggestion for file setup is to make it read-write by root and
read-only by the wheel group. This allows you to set up some
security (by controlling who is in the wheel group) without having
to `su' to root every time you want to check some of the files.
Re-starting <b  >syslogd</b> does not require killing the
syslogd program. All that is needed is to send a SIGHUP (signal
number 1) to the process, and it will re-read its configuration
files. To help you out even more, the PID of syslogd is stored in
the /etc/syslog.pid file. As root:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
kill -HUP `cat /etc/syslog.pid`
</pre><p>will re-start the syslog daemon and put your changes into
effect. Some Linux packages also include a script called
/etc/syslogd.restart, which is merely a script that runs the above
kill program. If for some reason you want to actually kill the
syslogd program, a TERM signal (or 15) will kill the program
(<b  >kill -TERM `cat /etc/syslog.pid`</b>)</p><p>If you have trouble with either of these, consider using the
killall program. This is a linux-specific program, but is quite
useful:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
killall -HUP syslogd
</pre><p>will work on almost any Linux box. The only possible problem
is if you are trying to learn how to administer Unix systems in
general, you may be spoiled by using the convenient, but
Linux-specific killall command.</p><p>For more information, look at the man pages for syslogd and
syslog.conf. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sendmail</em></span> book published by
O'Reilly &amp; Associates (often referred to as the &ldquo;Bat book&rdquo;
because it features a picture of a bat on the cover) also devotes a
few pages to syslog (aside from being a great book on configuring
sendmail).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x151a580.0x160b258"></a>Corrections</h2></div></div><p>In my January 1995 article <span   class="emphasis"><em>rm your way to fun and
adventure</em></span> dealing with the problems of un-deleting, I
made a few critical errors which made their way into print.
Fortunately, Matt Welsh caught some of these and pointed them out
to me.</p><p>First, my alias for rm was a bit off. It only copied the
first file you gave it (which made it not-usable if you gave it a *
or list of files as an argument). The best way to replace it is to
create a shell function in the bash shell:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rm()
{
mv $@ ~/.rm
}
</pre><p>Note that you can use /tmp/.rm/$LOGNAME if you preferred
storing files in /tmp as originally suggested:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mv $@ /tmp/.rm/$LOGNAME
</pre><p>/bin/tcsh uses $LOGIN for storing the username. /bin/bash
uses $LOGNAME. This often creates fun for writing shell scripts. If
you are using a shell other than /bin/bash, test it first!!</p><p>So, the /etc/profile should have these lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
alias waste=/bin/rm
rm()
{
mv $@ ~/.rm
}
if [ ! -e ~/.rm ];
then
  mkdir ~/.rm
  chmod og-rwx ~/.rm
fi
</pre><p>if you wish to have the deleted files stored in the user's
home directory or:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
alias waste=/bin/rm
rm()
{
mv $@ /tmp/.rm/$LOGNAME
}
if [ ! -e /tmp/.rm/$LOGNAME ];
then
  mkdir /tmp/.rm/$LOGNAME
  chmod og-rwx /tmp/.rm/$LOGNAME
fi
</pre><p>if you wish to have deleted files stored under
/tmp/.rm.</p><p>Using this method will create some problems for users:</p><p>1) This method will not preserve the directory structure. If
a user does:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rm foo
cd ..
rm foo
</pre><p>only the second foo file will be available for deletion, as
the original foo was overwritten by the second one.
</p><p>2) Certain switches to <b  >rm</b> that users will
be accustomed to, such as -r, will not be available to them or may
do something different.</p><p>3) Make sure that /tmp/.rm has full write permissions to it,
so that users can create /tmp/.rm/$LOGNAME if it does not already
exist.</p><p>4) With the second method, if you delete a directory and /tmp
and the directory you are deleting are on two different
filesystems, mv will complain about moving directories across
filesystems. This can happen, but is less likely to occur, with the
first method as well.</p><p>And as a side note, if you just type
<b  >crontab</b>, many versions of crontab will drop you
into the editor as opposed to <b  >crontab -l</b> that I
had listed. Mine does not, but yours might. The dcron22 used by
slackware will automatically drop you into the vi editor. The Vixie
Cron used by some other installations will check the value of the
EDITOR or VISUAL environmental variables if you wish to use another
editor.</p><p>So what (you might ask) is being done to prevent this from
happening again? Good question. I'm setting up a small mailing list
which will have as members some good Linux experts, along with some
not-so-experienced users so that any potential confusion or
problems get ironed out before we go to print. If you would like to
join this mailing list, please drop me an e-mail note at
