double-duty in Washington, D.C. this December at Open Systems
World&mdash;in addition to running a two-day &ldquo;Linux Conference&rdquo;, we also
had a booth in the exhibit hall where we handed out magazines, sold
books and distributions, and answered questions about Linux. This
created a problem on Thursday, when both the Linux Conference and
the booth were in operation. If all the gurus were speaking and
sitting on panels, not to mention listening, who would answer
questions about Linux at the <i  >LJ</i> booth? Although the people who knew
about Linux did stop by to help when they could, for most of the
day the booth was staffed by Linda Lacy and myself, both relative
Linux novices. I use Linux at home, but don't play around with it,
and Linda knows people who know Linux and is fairly computer
literate, but we are both mainly Linuxers by association. As it
turned out, that was enough.
</p><p>Here are some of the questions most often asked at the booth.
They are fairly basic. Some of them I knew the answers to simply by
having been around Linux people, others could be answered by
reading <i  >LJ</i>, and still others have answers in the wealth of
documentation written for Linux, if you just know where to look! I
think these questions shed light on what the outside community has
learned about Linux and what it still needs to learn.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11b7580.0x12af558"></a>&ldquo;What is, um, Li...&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>This is my favorite question to answer&mdash;&ldquo;It's pronounced
LIH-NUCKS. There is a good explanation on page 4 of this
<i  >Linux Journal</i>....&rdquo; If the questioner smiles
and nods as though he needs more explanation, I go on to explain
that it is a free Unix-like operating system that can be run on the
386, 486, and Pentium chips. (At this point, the questioner is
usually not interested in the ports of Linux to the Alpha, PowerPC,
or other platforms.) If the questioner is interested, he might ask
the next question:</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11b7580.0x12af6b8"></a>&ldquo;What is it useful for?&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>The answer to this question depends on whether the person
asking knows much about Unix. If he is totally satisfied with
Windows or DOS and the software for those platforms, feels no need
to multitask, and never wants to network his computers or connect
to the Internet, then it is possible that Linux would not be useful
for him. On the other hand, if the person is interested in one or
all of these things, and is interested in working a little to learn
how to use his computer better, Linux could be for him.</p><p>In addition, Linux is useful because the source code is
&ldquo;free&rdquo;, a quality not appreciated by everyone, but interesting to
the people at the conference who had just stopped at the Free
Software Foundation booth next door to ours. booth.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11b7580.0x12af818"></a>&ldquo;Can I run Linux on my home computer?&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>Yes, and many people (including myself) do. It really does
look just like other Unix systems, and it really does run on as
little as a 386-SX16 with 8 megs (or less) of RAM; I've seen it
done. On larger computers it runs as fast or faster than the
workstations one would see in business.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11b7580.0x12af920"></a>&ldquo;Can I run DOS and Linux at the same
time?&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>In other words, &ldquo;My wife and kids use Windows for word
processing and games, but I'd like to be able to do some of my Unix
work at home.&rdquo; This is made very simple for the DOS users by LILO,
the LInux boot LOader, so that when you turn on the computer, if
you press shift or some other key of your choice after the &ldquo;beep&rdquo;
sound, you can go right into DOS and use whatever you need. Plus,
you may be able to convince the other members of your family to use
Linux&mdash;they may even like it. A &ldquo;DOS emulator&rdquo; (called &ldquo;dosemu&rdquo;) is
available that runs most versions of DOS and most DOS programs from
within Linux, as well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11b7580.0x12afa28"></a>&ldquo;Will I have to repartition my hard
drive?&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>I always answered this question &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and encouraged people
to page through Matt Welsh's Installation and Getting Started to
get some idea of what actually installing Linux involves. However,
there is a way of installing Linux &ldquo;over&rdquo; a DOS filesystem without
repartitioning, but for maximum performance, repartitioning is
recommended. All the distributions come with a program called
&ldquo;FIPS&rdquo;, which can split a DOS partition into a DOS partition and a
Linux partition without destroying the data on the DOS
partition.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11b7580.0x12afb30"></a>&ldquo;What is a Linux distribution, and what is the
best distribution?&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>A Linux distribution is the Linux kernel, together with
essential utilities and whatever the person or people putting it
together thought would be useful. The main difference between
distributions is in installation and in what comes along for the
ride. There is no best distribution in itself&mdash;everything depends
on what the person installing it is trying to do.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11b7580.0x12afc38"></a>&ldquo;Are you affiliated with the Linux
Company?&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>Well.... the fact that there is no &ldquo;Linux Company&rdquo; really
disturbs some people and amazes others. This question shows how
many people misunderstand the Linux development process and how
people expect all products (except for maybe shareware) to be
developed inside companies and then sold. The people who make up
the Linux Community (as close to an all-inclusive organization as
Linux has come) showcase the power of the Internet to bring people
together to produce something useful and are the antithesis of the
crackers who use the Internet for vandalism and destruction.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11b7580.0x12afd40"></a>&ldquo;Are there any applications for Linux?&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>The answer to this is &ldquo;sort of&rdquo;. Most free software for Unix
is available for Linux. In addition, many software companies are
selling their products for use under Linux&mdash;for example, the
advertisers in this magazine. Finally, Linux has SCO, SVR3, and
SVR4 emulation, so it is possible to run SCO, SVR3, and SVR4
binaries under Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11b7580.0x12afe48"></a>&ldquo;Is it really stable enough to use in a business
situation?&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>See the articles &ldquo;The Roger Maris Cancer Center&mdash;Depending on
Linux&rdquo; (Issue 5, Sept. 1994), &ldquo;Linux in Antarctica&rdquo; (Issue 7, Nov.
1994), and &ldquo;Virginia Power&mdash;Linux Hard at Work&rdquo; (Issue 9, Jan.
1995) for real life examples of how people are using Linux. (These
articles&mdash;and more&mdash;are available in The Linux Sampler published by
SSC.) This is not to say that they grab the newest patches off the
net as soon as they arrive and install them willy-nilly on their
systems without testing, but that with ordinary caution (all
systems are breakable, no matter what the operating system) Linux
is viable.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11b7580.0x12aff50"></a>&ldquo;How many people actually use Linux?&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>No one really knows, since no one is required to register
their copies. However, the CD distributors are shipping
approximately 30,000-40,000 copies a month, which does not include
the people who download Linux from the Internet or who borrow their
friend's distribution. Some have estimated that around a million
people currently use Linux; whatever the number is, it is growing
every day.</p><p>And finally,</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11b7580.0x12b00b0"></a>&ldquo;My (computerese) won't (more technical terms).
What's wrong?&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>Answer: &ldquo;Um, I think that I see one of the speakers from the
Linux conference coming this way. I'm sure he'll be able to answer
your question.&rdquo;</p></div></div>
