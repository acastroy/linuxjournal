    Randy Bentson reflects on the early days of Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2168580.0x22603f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The histories of many programming
projects are maintained by oral tradition. After all, what real
programmer would take the time to write down what has happened?
Because much of Linux was developed by way of e-mail conversations
on the net, a slightly more firm record exists. The following is
gleaned from those records.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2168580.0x2260500"></a>How Many of Us Missed the Boat?</h2></div></div><p>I first worked with Minix in Fall 1989. Dr. Tanenbaum's
system was a perfect vehicle for working with operating systems for
those who couldn't afford a VAX. It ran on an 8086 with 640 Kbytes
and a floppy drive. You could run a few programs in a multi-tasking
environment and, since you had the source, you could change the
system to your heart's content.</p><p>&ldquo;But wait,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;Minix isn't Linux. What are you talking
about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I'm just setting the stage, bear with me a moment.&rdquo;</p><p>The intended target for Minix was students of operating
systems in a computer science curriculum. I used it in teaching an
upper division class where the term projects were to &ldquo;enhance the
system in some meaningful way.&rdquo; The projects varied from a serial
port driver, to virtual terminals, to simple memory management. No
one took the giant step that Linus Torvalds took at the University
of Helsinki. (I wish I could say one of my students was changing
the course of personal computing!)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2168580.0x2260710"></a>The Foundation</h2></div></div><p>As you may know, the memory model of the 8086 is very
limiting. It had easy access to only 640 Kbytes of non-virtual
memory. Ugh! But that was the target system for Minix because it
was the most common and cheapest system available.</p><p>Linus rejected that argument and decided that one
<span   class="emphasis"><em>needed</em></span> virtual memory to be able to do
anything interesting. Thus, he reckoned that an 80386 was the
minimum processor for his system.</p><p>His project was to build a kernel for a virtual memory,
pre-emptive, multi-user system. It would have much the same user
interface as Minix (in fact it used the same file system as Minix
for some time) and that of Unix.</p><p>From the beginning, Linus made reference to the GNU portable
kernel, Hurd, and made it clear that he wasn't planning to supplant
Hurd. Since Hurd was expected to be available in late 1992, Linux
was clearly just a hackers' delight.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2168580.0x2260978"></a>Growing Use</h2></div></div><p>By the time Linus conceived of his project in April 1991,
Minix had changed to support the improved Intel processors, but
there was still room for extension. Initially Linux was cast in
terms of a Minix project, but by late summer the divergence was
starting to show.</p><p>Early versions were labeled 0.01 (Sept. 91), 0.02 (Oct. 91),
0.03 (Nov. 91), etc., as a hint that they weren't really releases
so much as snapshots of work in progress.</p><p>Linus gathered a few supporters who would exercise and
enhance his work and who appreciated receiving (and contributing)
fixes as quickly as they were developed. The kernel soon came to
support all the system calls expected of a Unix kernel as more
restrictions were removed.</p><p>Linus ported gcc and bash, so there was a basic compiler and
command interpreter in place. (Although, to be precise, the
compilations were done under Minix up to version 0.12.) There was
some discussion in comp.os.minix about the wisdom of going off and
starting another OS, but Linus had his dream, or, some would say,
he was stubborn and he persisted.</p><p>By January 1992, the 0.12 version took only modest care to
build and operate and, thus, contributed a lot towards popularizing
Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2168580.0x2260be0"></a>Other Projects Enter...</h2></div></div><p>It should be noted that this was not the only free Unix
system for home computers. 386BSD was being developed in California
and was a derivative of the Berkeley Unix that had been widely
distributed on university campuses around the world. To some
extent, 386BSD was a benchmark against which Linux was
compared.</p><p>At the same time, the various GNU tools were becoming well
established in the Unix domain. The standard C compiler, gcc, was
regularly found to be better than most vendors' compilers, and the
other tools were generally more robust and feature-full than the
vendor versions. The fitting of the GNU applications to the Linux
kernel was natural and necessary to the success of Linux.</p><p>The growing community of Linux users were not afraid to build
up a system from sources around the world. A second outside
product, the X Window System, provided a GUI interface for Linux
users with high-end displays. A third product, NetBSD, provided a
springboard to get full Internet support for Linux.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="0041f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Production Releases
</p></div></div><p>The initial numbering scheme had some limitations, but
questions such as &ldquo;Does 0.11 come before or after 0.2?&rdquo; were safely
avoided and the numbering quickly arrived at a limiting value of
0.99. That version was widely distributed, and it was regarded as
the first full-featured version of the Linux kernel. There was, by
then, a sizeable community of users who depended on a stable
version of the kernel. Although there were many patches and
sub-patches to this version&mdash;often arriving daily&mdash;the basic
version 0.99 was suitable for release.</p><p>The Great Release took place at the start of 1994, when Linus
identified a stable patch level (0.99pl14r), cleaned up a few last
problems, and called it good. This operation was called a &ldquo;code
freeze&rdquo; and resulted in version 0.99pl15, which held steady long
enough for bug fixes, but no enhancements, to arrive.</p><p>Part of the code freeze and the Great Release was the
recognition that Linux had become a suitable foundation for
production systems&mdash;systems devoted to doing useful work, instead
of being the object of a programmer's machinations. This posed a
dilemma: how could Linux continue to evolve and yet be
stable?</p><p>The solution was simple: have two development paths starting
from the same point. The even-numbered releases (1.0.0, 1.0.1,
1.0.2, etc.) followed a slow, careful evolution of a production
release system and the odd-numbered releases (1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2,
etc.) were to be the fast-changing, experimental system. Version
0.99pl15, with a few fixes, was the basis of these two systems.
Some important fixes moved 1.0.0 to 1.0.9 in the early months of
1994, but that system development path has been unchanged since
mid-year. By contrast, 1.1.0 underwent over 50 changes in the first
10 months.</p><p>Plans are now afoot for the next major release. Again, the
stable and well-tested features of the experimental versions (up
past 1.1.60) will be incorporated in a production release called
1.2.0. Its twin, version 1.3.0, will be the basis of yet more
experimental work on the kernel.</p><p>One thing that also happened with the Great Release was the
release itself no longer catalogued its changes. This shortcoming
was alleviated when Russell Nelson,
<a href="mailto:nelson@crynwr.com">nelson@crynwr.com</a>
volunteered to distribute a change summary shortly after each patch
was distributed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2168580.0x22611b8"></a>Distribution Kits</h2></div></div><p>All during the development of the kernel, concurrent
development was being done on the tools I've mentioned, as well as
others. One of the topics of discussion by users was what they
collected for their system. Since new users didn't want to hunt the
net for the critical pieces, the idea of a &ldquo;standard distribution&rdquo;
was established.</p><p>One common medium of exchange has been the floppy disk, so
the distribution kits have generally been cast in terms of images
of MS-DOS-readable disks. One can copy a friend's disk set and then
bootstrap Linux. If you're anywhere near a large community, chances
are there is a Linux or Unix users group nearby. If you're lucky,
you'll find a set of floppies to borrow. If that fails, it's almost
certain you'll find someone who will copy their distribution to
your floppies.</p><p>Distribution kits include: Debian, MCC, Slackware, Software
Landing Systems (SLS), SUSE, TAMU, Yggdrasil.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2168580.0x2261370"></a>Publishers</h2></div></div><p>These distribution kits are generally deposited or maintained
on an ftp site and mirrored to other ftp sites. Many bulletin
boards maintain copies of these distributions. This gives you a
second path to acquire Linux: all you have to do is download 50
Mbyte via modem.</p><p>The third and, I think, most significant path to acquiring
Linux is CD-ROM. A number of companies publish one or more (I've
seen as many as four) distributions on a single CD-ROM. The
companies add lots of other material, such as X-Windows, the GNU
sources and snapshots of archive sites (which contain other,
non-distribution kit software), to their packages and sell them for
$20 to $40. Since you can easily spend $20 in floppy disks for a
distribution kit alone, this is quite a bargain! When one can now
buy a single-speed CD-ROM drive for less than $100, getting a
distribution by way of CD-ROM is very attractive.</p><p>Some of the current Linux CD-ROM publishers include:
InfoMagic, Morse Telecommunication, Nascent, Red Hat Software,
Trans-Ameritech, Walnut Creek and Yggdrasil Computing, Inc.</p><p>It should be noted that distribution kits have different
numbering than the kernel itself, and CD-ROMs may have yet another
way of identifying versions. This can lead to confusion when
someone refers to &ldquo;the Fall 1993 release&rdquo; or &ldquo;the 2.0 release&rdquo;. If
you look at /usr/src/linux/Makefile, you'll find the version, patch
level, and sub-level in the first few lines. Look at the
README-type files in the root of the distribution to determine the
kit's version.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2168580.0x2261580"></a>It's Deja Vu All Over Again</h2></div></div><p>My first experience with Unix was in 1980, when I was handed
three 2400' reels of half-inch magnetic tape and a two-foot high
stack of xerographed manual pages. I was pointed to the VAX and
wished the best of luck.</p><p>Those were heady times, living on the edge, working without a
safety net. One's phone list (of other system administrators) was
critical to one's survival. Everyone (the system administrators and
select students) had the source code, and one was expected to dive
into the kernel and fix things.</p><p>But things got boring for a while in the late 1980s: vendors
distributed only object files for their Unix systems and there were
commercially-available support groups to call. One was expected to
manage configuration files and submit bug reports&mdash;and then wait
for a correction.</p><p>In a conversation just last week, I pointed out that those
golden days are with us again, only better. First, the number of
sites and kernel programmers has grown ten-fold or a hundred-fold,
so there are more folks contributing fixes and improvements.
Second, since we're running on personal computers, the effects of
our changes are localized, and we're even more free to explore.
Finally, with widespread Internet service, we're so much better
connected to one another.</p><p>These are such interesting times!</p></div></div>
