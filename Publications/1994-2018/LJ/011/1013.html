    Last month, we gave an introduction to interrupt-driver
    block device drivers. This month, we examine common
    optimizations that can allow an order of magnitude
    improvement in performance on some hardware, and then cover
    some of the points that have been left out in our whirlwind
    tour of block device drivers.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6c580.0x1c644a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month, I ran out of space for this
column just as I was about to start a long discussion on
optimizations. In the interest of usefulness, I will mention only
the most useful optimizations here before going on to discuss
initialization.
</p><p>I won't have any sample code implementations of the
optimizations, because these are complex issues that need to be
handled in device-specific ways, and just as the code was much more
vague when I discussed interrupt-driven drivers than when I
introduced the basic, initial device driver, it would either be so
large as to take over the entire magazine or be so vague as to be
completely useless if I were to try to write some here. I hope that
my explanations are useful to you even without code.</p><p>Also, I should warn you that the optimizations I talk about,
while representative of common optimizations, are not necessarily
representative of anything you will find in the Linux source code,
except where I explicitly state otherwise. I'm writing on a
slightly more theoretical level&mdash;about what can be done, rather
than what has been done. Things conceptually similar to what I
write about have been done, but the details are my own and may not
be the best way to go about things. As usual, use this column as an
introduction to the kernel source code and read the actual source
code for far more insight than I can give you here.</p><p>If you are code-starved and don't care about optimizations,
jump right to the second part of this article, where I talk about
initialization.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6c580.0x1c646b8"></a>Coalescence</h2></div></div><p>One common optimization is coalescing adjacent requests. This
means that when the driver is notified or notices that a request
has been added to the request queue, it looks through the request
list to see if there is a request for the next block (and possibly
more blocks beyond that). If so, it sends a request to the hardware
to read more than one block with one command, and when the data
comes in from the hardware (presumably in an interrupt service
routine), it fills both requests before calling
<b  >end_request(1)</b> (actually, some similar function
designed especially for that driver) on either request. After
satisfying (or failing to satisfy) the requests, the equivalent of
<b  >end_request()</b> is called for each request, but
without waking up processes waiting on either request until the
interrupt has been satisfied.</p><p>This will require that you write your own version of
<b  >end_request()</b>. Although this probably sounds
daunting, it isn't as hard as it sounds, because you can use almost
all of it as-is. For example, you could copy it verbatim, except
instead of doing <b  >wake_up(&amp;wait_for_request)</b>
at the end, you could add <b  >wait_for_request</b> to a
list of events to wake up when you are ready. Then you would call
this new <b  >almost_end_request()</b> function as soon
as you have finished processing each request. When you are done handling
the entire interrupt and are ready to wake up processes, iterate
over the list of events, calling <b  >wake_up()</b> on
each in turn, from first satisfied to last satisfied.</p><p>Note that <b  >wake_up()</b> will not cause a
context switch directly. The driver will not give up control while
running <b  >wake_up()</b> to a process being woken up.
Instead, <b  >wake_up()</b> makes all the processes being
woken up &ldquo;runnable&rdquo;, and sets the <b  >need_resched</b>
flag. This flag says that the scheduler ought to be called at the
next convenient time, such as when returning from a &ldquo;slow&rdquo;
interrupt handling routine (including the clock handling routine)
or when returning from a system call. This means that the driver
will not be pre-empted by calling <b  >wake_up()</b>, and
so it will be able to wake up all the necessary processes without
being pre-empted.</p><p>This will likely take several tries to get right. All I can
say to help is &ldquo;Make sure you have backups. Really.&rdquo;</p><p>The only driver in the Linux kernel that I have noticed doing
anything like this is the floppy driver; the track buffer works in
a similar way, where more than one request may be satisfied by a
single read command sent to the hardware. If you are interested in
investigating how it works, read drivers/block/floppy.c and search
for <b  >floppy_track_buffer</b> and read the entire
function <b  >make_raw_rw_request()</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6c580.0x1c64df0"></a>Scatter-Gather</h2></div></div><p>Sounds like a &ldquo;boondoggle&rdquo;, doesn't it? Scatter-gather is perhaps a little bit similar in
concept to coalescing adjacent requests, but is used with more
intelligent hardware, and is perhaps a bit easier to implement. The
&ldquo;scatter&rdquo; part means that when there are multiple blocks to be
written all over a disk (for example), one command is sent out to
initiate writing to all those different sectors, reducing the
overhead involved in negotiation from O(n) to O(1), where
<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> is the number of blocks or sectors to
write.</p><p>Similarly, the &ldquo;gather&rdquo; part means that when there are
multiple blocks to be read, one command is sent out to initiate
reading all the blocks, and as the disk sends in each block, the
corresponding request is marked as satisfied with
<b  >end_request(1)</b> or equivalent device-specific
code. You will only be able to easily use
<b  >end_request()</b> unmodified with scatter-gather if
each block read or written results in a separate interrupt being
generated, and perhaps not even then. The SCSI driver does its own,
which is probably the best way to go.</p><p>If you want to increase throughput, at the slight expense of
response time, you could use timers to help: when your
<b  >request()</b> is notified that there is a request,
and sees that there is only one request outstanding, it could set a
timer to go off soon (one or two tenths of a second, perhaps),
assuming that while waiting, more requests will spill in to be
dealt with, and that when a certain number of requests have been
made, or the timer has gone off, whichever comes first,
scatter-gather will be applied to the blocks. If the
<b  >request()</b> routine is called and notices that
&ldquo;enough&rdquo; (however many that is...) requests have accumulated, it
would un-install the timer and process the requests. If the timer
were to go off, all requests would be processed.</p><p>Note that the timer used should not be the same static timer
used for the hardware timeout. Instead, it should be a dynamically
allocated timer. See <b  >&lt;linux/timer.h&gt;</b> for
details on the dynamic timer routines.</p><p>I will repeat my standard disclaimer: this is simplified (at
least, I'm trying to simplify it...) and if you want more detailed
and correct information, study a real driver. The SCSI high-level
drivers (scsi.c, sd.c, sr.c) are definitely the place to start. (I
don't mention st.c and sg.c because they are character, not block,
devices.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6c580.0x1c65268"></a>Errors</h2></div></div><p>Optimization is almost easy to write about, and sounds
glamorous, but error handling is really where the rubber meets the
road. I'm not even going to try to really cover error handling in
this column. It is a very complex subject, and different for each
piece of hardware. If you have read this far, you should have the
basic knowledge you need to start reading the block device drivers
in the kernel. By reading all the error handling there, you will
begin to understand how to do error handling nicely. Consider
reading the drivers in this sequence: ramdisk.c, hd.c, and
floppy.c.</p><p>As you write your driver, you will probably start with very
simple error handling. As you use your driver, you are likely to
discover more error cases to handle. Sometimes you will find that
you need to redesign some components of your driver to get error
handling correct. As an example, until very recently, error
handling in the floppy driver was not very good. You could mount a
write-protected floppy read-write and cause serious problems when
you then tried to write to the floppy. Also, if you tried (for
instance) to write a tar archive on a write-protected floppy, you
would get a stream of errors as the driver reset the floppy drive
and kept assuming the error would go away. It took a significant
rewrite of the floppy driver to solve that problem
correctly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6c580.0x1c653c8"></a>Initialization</h2></div></div><p>This isn't really specific to block device drivers, but it is
certainly necessary to know. In issue 9, I gave an example
initialization function, but it was mostly pseudo-code and didn't
cover many of the things that you need to do to work with real
devices. For instance, it doesn't explain how to grab a DMA
channel, nor does it explain how to grab an IRQ line.</p><p>The easiest way to deal with IRQ and DMA is to allocate both
the IRQ line and DMA channel while initializing the device. It's
not the best way, but it is the easiest way to start out while you
are writing your device driver. When you want to figure out exactly
when to allocate and free them, you can read other device drivers.
The floppy device driver, for instance, has functions
<b  >floppy_grab_irq_and_dma()</b> and
<b  >floppy_release_irq_and_dma()</b> which do exactly
what they say, and are used not only in the initialization code,
but all through the rest of the driver.</p><p>The <b  >floppy_grab_irq_and_dma()</b> function is
a good place to start to learn how to allocate IRQ lines and DMA
channels. According to <b  >&lt;asm/dma.h&gt;</b>, the
IRQ line should be allocated first and released last.</p><p>We'll look at IRQs first. <b  >request_irq()</b>
takes four arguments. The first argument to
<b  >request_irq()</b> is the number of the IRQ line to
allocate. The second is the interrupt service routine to call when
an interrupt is received. The third is a flag which is either set
to <b  >SA_INTERRUPT</b> or something else (presumably
0), which determines whether the argument passed to the interrupt
service routine is a pointer to a register structure (0) or the
number of the interrupt (<b  >SA_INTERRUPT</b>), and also
whether the interrupt is a &ldquo;fast&rdquo; interrupt handler
(<b  >SA_INTERRUPT</b>) or a &ldquo;slow&rdquo; interrupt handler
(0). A &ldquo;slow&rdquo; interrupt handler is one where more processing is
done when the interrupt handler returns, including possibly running
the scheduler to choose a new process to become the active one. A
&ldquo;fast&rdquo; interrupt handler does as little as possible. The fourth
argument is the name of the device driver.</p><p><b  >request_irq()</b> is simpler. It takes two
arguments, the first of which is the IRQ channel, and the second of
which is the name of the device driver.</p><p>The corresponding freeing functions are even simpler.
<b  >free_dma()</b> takes only the number of the DMA
channel, and <b  >free_irq()</b> takes only the number of
the IRQ.</p><p>Of course, there is far more to using IRQs, and even more so
to using DMA, than allocating and freeing lines and channels, but
this is a start. The start, to be pedantic. Read
<b  >&lt;asm/dma.h&gt;</b>,
<b  >kernel/dma.c</b>,
<b  >&lt;asm/irq.h&gt;</b>, and
<b  >kernel/irq.c</b> for details; they are very
readable, and have many useful comments.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6c580.0x1c65c60"></a>Mail</h2></div></div><p>K. D. Nguyen sent me some e-mail after reading the January
issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, echoing a wish I have
heard from other people as well.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I have been reading two books on Unix device
drivers, the KHG, and the Kernel Korner articles since last issue.
I feel like I can write some device drivers. But unfortunately,
there seems to be something missing from all the books and articles
about Unix device drivers. It is the lack of a practice
environment. We, the device driver beginners, can only read and
look at some device driver code under Linux and try to understand
how they work. It would be more fun if there were some hardware or
device kit that let us really do some exercise on what we just read
about writing Unix device drivers (rather than buying a new color
printer and then begging the manufacture for the specs to write a
new challenging device driver). Of course, for the meantime, I will
keep reading.</p></blockquote></div><p>There is no real practice environment. The easiest way to
start learning is to write a ramdisk driver. Beyond that, many real
devices are actually fairly simple. Dive in! It's hard to dabble at
the water's edge when you are writing kernel code for a monolithic
OS, regardless of whether you are writing code for a simple ramdisk
or for a toy device kit or for a real device. The learning curve is
quite steep, but that means that in a short time of strenuous
learning, you really pick up most of what you need to write basic
device drivers.</p><p>Also, what features would a practice device support, and what
would it do? It's a hard question to answer and one I'm not going
to attempt&mdash;and I think that manufacturers won't either. Since you
are as likely to screw up your entire system writing a driver for a
practice device as for a real one, you might as well work on a real
device. There <span   class="bold"><b>are</b></span> real devices as
simple as any toy device.</p><p><a href="1013s1.html" target="_self">Other Resources</a></p></div></div>
