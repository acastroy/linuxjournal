    Greg Hankins describes how to install Slackware Linux over a
    network.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x287a580.0x29723f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of the easiest and quickest ways to
install Linux is over a network, using NFS (Network File System).
All you need is a machine that has the full Linux distribution
available for NFS mounting. In this article, I'll describe in
detail how to install Linux via NFS using the Slackware 2.1.0
distribution, although the concept of installing operating systems
over the network is by no means specific to Linux or Slackware.
</p><p>The first step in the installation process is to make sure
that the filesystem containing the distribution is available for
mounting on your soon-to-be Linux box. Talk to your sysadmins and
ask them nicely to export the filesystem for you to mount. You'll
also need to get an IP address for your Linux machine. Your
sysadmin can help you with this, too. While you're gathering
information, find out your netmask, gateway address, the IP address
of the machine containing the distribution, and what the path to
the distribution directory is. Write these down; you'll need all
this information later.</p><p>Next, you'll need to make a boot disk and a root-install disk
to boot Linux on your PC. Since we want to install via NFS, it's
rather important that we choose a boot disk with networking
drivers. The boot disks can be found in the
<b  >bootdsks.144</b> or <b  >bootdsks.12</b>
directory in the slackware distribution. Choose the directory
according to the size floppy disk drive you have: the &ldquo;144&rdquo;
directories are for 3.5" floppies, and the &ldquo;12&rdquo; directories are for
5.25" floppies. If you are using IDE disk drives, use the
<b  >net</b> boot disk. If you are using SCSI disk
drives, use the <b  >scsinet</b> boot disk. Root-install
disks can be found in the <b  >rootdsks</b> directory.
The <b  >color</b> disk uses a full-screen color install
program and is very nice. This is the one I used when I wrote this
article. Alternatively, you can use the <b  >tty</b>
disk. It uses text based install scripts. Installation using the
<b  >umsds</b> disk should also be possible, in the
unlikely event you need to keep DOS around.</p><p>All boot and root disks are described in more detail in
<b  >README</b> files in each of the disk directories, if
you'd like to know more about them. Once you've decided on your
boot and root-install disk, you need to format two floppies and
copy one image onto each of them. Please read the
<b  >INSTALL.TXT</b> file, section 3.4.2.1, in the
top-level slackware directory, for exact instructions on how to do
this. In fact, you should probably print this file out, since
you'll need it to help you repartition your hard drive later on.
While you're making floppies, go ahead and format a spare one. This
will be needed later on to make a bootable floppy for
emergencies.</p><p>Grab the three floppies and go over to your PC. Make sure
that you are actually plugged into a network. Then, insert the boot
floppy and power up your machine. You should see the letters
<b  >LILO</b> appear on your screen. This means that the
<span   class="bold"><b>LI</b></span>nux
<span   class="bold"><b>LO</b></span>ader is loading Linux. After
some whirring, you will be prompted for extra parameters to boot
your system with at the <b  >boot:</b> prompt. You
probably don't need to type anything here since you are installing
a new system. Just hit &lt;return&gt;. You'll see Linux announce
that it's loading the ramdisk, and various device drivers will
initialize. This may take a couple of minutes. When the system asks
you to switch disks, remove your boot floppy, and insert your
root-install floppy. Don't forget to hit &lt;return&gt;. Linux will
then load a root filesystem into memory. When the system has
finished loading, you'll see a message containing important
information (which you should read), and then a <b  >slackware
login:</b> prompt. At this point, you can login as the
superuser root; no password is needed.</p><p>Once the system is running, the first thing to do is
repartition your hard drive. Using the <b  >fdisk</b>
program, create some Linux partitions and a swap partition. See
section 4.1 in <b  >INSTALL.TXT</b> which you printed out
earlier, if you need help doing this. Write down the partitions you
created! You'll need to know the partition names later on. If you
have less than 4MB of RAM, you'll need to activate your swap
partition now. Follow the instructions in
<b  >/etc/issue</b> if you don't know how to do this. If
you have more than 4MB of RAM, you can activate your swap partition
from within the setup program.</p><p>Now, run the <b  >setup</b> program. Unless you
have already activated your swap partition, choose the
<b  ><i><tt>A</tt></i>DDSWAP</b> option from
the menu. setup will detect your swap partition, and ask you if you
want to activate it. Answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and also answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; when asked
if you want to use <b  >mkswap</b> and if you want to
activate the swap partition. Then, setup will setup your swap
partition for you.</p><p>We'll continue the installation by creating our
<b  ><i><tt>T</tt></i>ARGET</b> partitions.
You can continue on to this step from the
<b  >ADDSWAP</b> option, or choose it from the top-level
install menu. Again, setup will identify appropriate partitions for
you to use as Linux filesystems. Looking at your list of partitions
you created, figure out which partition you are going to use for
your root Linux partition. Enter this partition at the prompt.
You'll be asked to choose a type of Linux filesystem to use. Most
people use the <b  >ext2</b> (Linux Second Extended
Filesystem). If you are a beginning Linuxer, this is a good choice
for you. Having decided which filesystem you want to use, you need
to format the partition. Choose the <b  >Check</b> option
from the menu to do this. If you have more than one partition setup
for Linux, repeat the process for all your partitions. When you're
done, type a <b  >q</b> to finish the
<b  >TARGET</b> section.</p><p>So far so good. You can now continue to the
<b  >SOURCE</b> option, or choose it from the top-level
menu if you're not going in sequence. Select option 3 &ldquo;Install via
NFS&rdquo;. The warning message you'll see next sounds intimidating, but
don't worry&mdash;it's not that bad. Gather your courage and your list
of networking information and continue.</p><p>At the prompt, enter the IP address assigned for your PC.
Next, enter your netmask. If you have a gateway (i.e., the NFS
server is not on the same subnet as your PC), enter it; if not,
answer &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Enter the IP address of the machine that has the
Slackware distribution. Last, enter the pathname to the
distribution. The setup program will put you into text mode and try
to configure the networking. You should see something similar to
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 Configuring ethernet card...
 Configuring our gateway...
 Mounting NFS...
 Current mount table:
 /dev/fd0 on / type minix (rw)
 none on /proc type proc (rw)
 /dev/hda1 on /mnt type ext2 (rw)
 111.112.113.114:/slackware on /var/adm/mount type nfs
 (rw,addr=111.112.113.114)
</pre><p>If you don't see an error occur in the network setup, you can
continue. If there is an error, go back and try again. Make sure
you enter the correct network information.</p><p>That was the hard part. Now, continue on to the <b  >DISK
SETS</b> section, or choose it from the top-level menu.
Section 3.1 of <b  >INSTALL.TXT</b> has good instructions
on how to choose disk sets. Aren't you glad you printed it out?
After selecting which software you want to install, continue on to
the <b  >INSTALL</b> section, or choose it from the
top-level menu. Go through the installation process&mdash;this is
lengthy, but not nearly as lengthy as installing using floppies. We
know this from experience!</p><p>Linux is now installed on your PC. Take a break and rejoice.
You're nearly done. The only thing left to do, before you go
tearing into your new system, is <b  >CONFIGURE</b> a few
more things on your Linux system. Continue on, or choose this
option from the top-level menu. The first thing to do, is make a
backup bootable floppy disk. Insert the other disk you formatted
earlier and hit &ldquo;OK&rdquo;. The next step in the configuration makes
links for your modem and mouse devices. I do not recommend making
the modem link, because it can mess up serial communications
programs later on. But if using <b  >/dev/modem</b> is
easier for you, then let <b  >setup</b> make the link.
The same goes for the mouse link. If you have a CD-ROM, you can
configure the CD-ROM device at the next prompt. The last
installation step is to configure LILO, the Linux Loader. Choose
the appropriate options for the type of operating systems you have
on your hard disk. LILO can load several other operating systems
(term used loosely here) in addition to Linux. The LILO
configuration depends on your setup, but the menus are very
self-explanatory.</p><p>That's it. You're really done now. Exit setup. You will be
dropped back to the <b  >#</b> prompt. All you have to do
now, is eject the floppy disk from your disk drive and type reboot.
If you did not install LILO, put your boot floppy in the floppy
drive. If you're not an experienced Unix hacker, a good thing to
read next is Installation and Getting Started by Matt Welsh. It can
be found on <b  >sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/LDP</b>
and in many bookstores around the country.</p><p>Happy Linuxing.</p></div></div>
