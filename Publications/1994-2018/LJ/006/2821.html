    Ever wanted an all-in-one program development, compilation,
    and debugging environment? Look no further than Emacs.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1132580.0x122a3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Those of you who tuned in last month will
recall &ldquo;Emacs: Friend or Foe?&rdquo;, a tutorial for people who can't
stand anything but <b  >vi</b>. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; you're
asking yourselves, &ldquo;What is this card-carrying
<b  >vi</b> fundamentalist doing writing yet another
article on Emacs?&rdquo; Sounds fishy, doesn't it?
</p><p>The truth is, once you get the hang of it, Emacs can greatly
simplify editing, especially editing program source code. I now
routinely use Emacs for developing and debugging programs.</p><p>It dramatically reduces turnaround time during the dreaded
<b  >edit-compile-curse-debug-edit</b> cycle. Here's how
to put Emacs to use in this manner.</p><p>The bulk of this tutorial assumes that you are familiar with
Emacs, as well as with customizing your Emacs environment (as
discussed in last month's tutorial, in <i  >Linux Journal</i> volume 1,
issue 5). As long as you know how to add code to your .emacs
startup file (or, as per last month's discussion,
<b  >~/emacs/startup.el</b>), you're set.</p><p>The functions and comments described here work with GNU Emacs
19.24.1. By the time you read this article, newer versions may be
available, in which case your mileage may vary.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1132580.0x122a818"></a>Editing C Code</h2></div></div><p>As you know, Emacs has several major modes associated with
programming. For example, C Mode is used for editing C source, Perl
Mode for Perl, and so on. First off, I'll discuss the features of C
Mode, and then explain how to compile and debug C programs within
Emacs.</p><p>The command <b  >M-x c-mode</b> is used to enter C
Mode. (Recall from last month: <b  >M-x</b> is
<b  >Meta-x</b> where meta is usually the &lt;esc&gt;
key.) However, Emacs is usually able to determine that C Mode
should be used for a C source file, either by the filename
extension <b  >.c</b>, or if the magic string</p><pre     class="programlisting">
-*- C -*-
</pre><p>appears on the first line of the file. See the Emacs
documentation on major modes if you're interested in how this
works.</p><p>Within C Mode, code is automatically indented according to
the values of several variables. These variables include
<b  >c-indent-level</b>, <b  >c-continued-
statement-offset</b>, and so on. The Emacs Info pages
describe these variables in gory detail; however, I find that the
default values work quite well, for a number of indentation styles.
Unless you have a particularly unique artistic flair when it comes
to indenting your code, I suspect that you won't have to fiddle
with Emacs' indentation variables.</p><p>A line is indented appropriately when you press TAB anywhere
on the line. This does not cause a tab character to be inserted; it
just indents the line according to the variable values mentioned
above. If you want to actually insert a tab character, prefix it
with <b  >C-q</b>.</p><p>To see how this works, start up Emacs and edit a file called
foo.c. Type a few lines of bogus C code, pressing RET after each.
Then go back and press TAB on each line to see the results.</p><p>Pressing LFD instead of RET is equivalent to pressing RET
followed by TAB&mdash;that is, you start a new line, and it is
automatically indented for you. I find it particularly useful to
bind RET to this function, which is
<b  >newline-and-indent</b>, so that I don't have to use
LFD when writing code. In my Emacs configuration file, I include
the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(define-key c-mode-map "\C-m' -newline-and-indent)
</pre><p>One feature that you may have noticed is that closing braces
and parentheses automatically
<span   class="bold"><b>blink</b></span> their opening counterparts.
This can help you to check that parentheses are balanced in your
code. If you don't like this feature, you can turn it off
using</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(setq blink-matching-paren nil)
</pre><p>in your <b  >.emacs</b> file (or
<b  >~/emacs/startup.el</b>, for those of you using the
method described last month. Hereafter, we will refer only to
<b  >.emacs</b>, but keep in mind that all of these
customizations can be used with both methods).</p><p>If you're running Emacs under X, the paren library will cause
matching parentheses and braces to be highlighted whenever point is
on an opening brace/parenthesis, or after a closing
brace/parenthesis. Simply including</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(load-library "paren")
</pre><p>in your <b  >.emacs</b> file will enable this
feature. Balanced parentheses are highlighted in the region face;
you can change the color or font used with commands such as
<b  >set-face-foreground</b>,
<b  >set-face-font</b>, and so on.</p><p>For example,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(set-face-background -0region "pink")
</pre><p>will set the background color for this face to pink. The
region face is also used to display the current region when
<b  >transient-mark-mode</b> is enabled. We'll talk a bit
more about faces below.</p><p>You'll also notice that typing a closing brace (on a line by
itself) will exdent the line containing the brace. When</p><p>typing code such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int foo() {
  /* Your code here */
</pre><p>After pressing RET, the next line will be indented relative
to the comment above it (assuming, of course, that you have bound
RET to <b  >newline-and-indent</b>). Now, after typing
the closing brace, you'll end up with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int foo() {
  /* Your code here */
}
</pre><p>Braces are bound to the function
<b  >electric-c-brace</b>, which inserts the brace, and
corrects indentation on the current line. The indentation of
braces, and the text enclosed by them, is controlled by the Emacs
variables <b  >c-brace-offset</b>,
<b  >c-imaginary-brace-offset</b>, and so on.</p><p>In general, your code should follow the indentation style set
forth by Emacs. Adding comments is one exception. Many programmers
like to set comments out towards the right margin of the display,
as in</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int floof(struct shoop *s, int i) {
   s-&gt;fnum = i;     /* You are not expected
                      to understand this */
   return 0;
}
</pre><p>Now that TAB has lost its natural ability to add whitespace,
how can we add such a comment? Emacs provides the
<b  >M-</b>; command, which begins a comment starting at
the column specified by the variable
<b  >comment-column</b>, which is set to 24 by default.
Of course, you can always add comments by typing</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/* ... */ by hand.
</pre><p>You can use <b  >M-x comment-region</b> to comment
out all lines in the current region. (For Emacs neophytes, the
region is defined by moving point to a particular location, using
<b  >C-Space</b> to set the &ldquo;mark&rdquo;, and then moving point
elsewhere. The region is the block of text between point and mark.
There are various other ways to set the region; for example, under
X, dragging mouse-1 over a portion of text will define the region.)
Likewise, <b  >M-C-\</b> (that's
<b  >meta-control-backslash</b>) will indent the current
region.</p><p>C Mode defines several new moving commands as well.
<b  >M-C-a</b> will move point to the beginning of the
current function. Similarly, <b  >M-C-e</b> will move
point to the end of the current function. Note, however, that the
&ldquo;current function&rdquo; is denoted by an opening or closing brace in the
first column of text. If you use a C indentation style such
as</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int foo() {
  /* Your code here */
}
</pre><p>Emacs won't be able to find the beginning of the function, as
the opening brace is at the end of the line. For these commands to
work properly, you should indent your code as so:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int foo()
{
  /* Your code here */
}
</pre><p>To select the region as the text of the current function, you
can use <b  >M-C-h</b>. This provides a convenient way to
manipulate entire functions. For example, the quick key sequence
<b  >M-C-h</b>, <b  >C-w</b>,
<b  >M-C-e</b>, <b  >C-y</b> will move the
current function below the following one. Impress your
friends!</p><p>The keys <b  >M-a</b> and <b  >M-e</b>
can be used to move to the beginning or end of the current C
statement (block, semicolon-delimited expression, etc.).</p><p>One last important C Mode feature: macro expansion. If you
run <b  >M-x c-macro-expand</b>, Emacs will run the C
preprocessor on the current region and display the results in
another buffer. For example, given the following code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
static XtResource resource_list[] = {
  { RES_N_doputimage, RES_C_doputimage,
    XtRBoolean, sizeof(Boolean),
    XtOffset(app_data_ptr,do_putimage),
    XtRImmediate, (XtPointer) FALSE,
  },
};
</pre><p>Selecting this text as the region, and calling c-macro-expand
gives us:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
static XtResource resource_list[] = {
  { "doPutImage", "DoPutImage",
    ((char*)&amp;XtStrings[1561]), sizeof(Boolean),
    ((Cardinal) (((char *)
    (&amp;(((app_data_ptr)0)-&gt;do_putimage))) -
    ((char *) 0))),
    ((char*)&amp;XtStrings[1695]), (XtPointer) 0,
  },
};
</pre><p>This can be useful if you're trying to debug complex macros,
or need to know the definition of a given preprocessor
symbol.</p><p>Many other modes exist for particular languages, such as Perl
Mode, Emacs LISP Mode, Prolog Mode, and so on. Most of these modes
share the basic features described above. The best way to learn
about a new mode is to enter it (with a command such as M-x
perl-mode) and use M-x describe-mode to get a rundown on its
features.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1132580.0x1222bd0"></a>Using faces</h2></div></div><p>Emacs-19 provides support for faces, which allow different
kinds of text to be displayed in various fonts and/or colors. In
last month's tutorial, we described how to configure faces under
Emacs; because use of faces is particularly helpful with respect to
editing source code, it bears repeating here.</p><p>The command <b  >M-x list-faces-display</b> will
display the current faces, and their associated names, in another
window. Faces are given names such as bold, bold-italic, and so on.
These names don't necessarily have anything to do with how the
faces appear&mdash;for example, your bold face needn't be in a bold
font.</p><p>The functions <b  >set-face-foreground</b> and
<b  >set-face-background</b> can be used to set the
foreground and background colors for a face, respectively.
<b  >set-face-font</b> sets the font used for a
particular face; <b  >set-face-underline-p</b> specifies
whether a particular face is displayed with an underline.</p><p>Faces are used most commonly within Font Lock Mode, a minor
mode which causes the current buffer to be &ldquo;fontified&rdquo;--that is,
the text is displayed in various faces depending on context. For
example, when using Font Lock Mode with C Mode, function names are
displayed in one face, comments in another, preprocessor directives
in another, and so on. This is a pleasant visual effect when
editing source code; you can easily identify function names and
comments by glancing at the display.</p><p>The following function can be used in your Emacs startup file
to enable Font Lock Mode and to set the colors for various
faces.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
defun my-turn-on-font-lock ()
  (interactive "")
  ;;; Color the faces appropriately
  (set-face-foreground -bold "lightblue")
  (set-face-foreground -bold-italic "olivedrab2")
  (set-face-foreground -italic "lightsteelblue")
  (set-face-foreground -modeline "white")
  (set-face-background -modeline "black")
  (set-face-background -highlight "blue")
  ;; Turn off underline property for bold and underline
  (set-face-underline-p -bold nil)
  (set-face-underline-p -underline nil)
  (transient-mark-mode 1)
  (font-lock-mode 1))
</pre><p>Note that in addition to turning on font-lock-mode, I enable
<b  >transient-mark-mode</b>. In this mode, the current
<b  >region</b> is shaded using the
<b  >region</b> face. This can save you a great deal of
time trying to remember where the current mark is set.</p><p>The above function is called by:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(defun my-window-setup-hook ()
   (set-foreground-color "white")
   (set-background-color "dimgray")
   (set-mouse-color "orchid")
   (set-cursor-color "red")
   (my-turn-on-font-lock))
(add-hook 'window-setup-hook 'my-window-setup-hook)
</pre><p>That is, the Emacs <b  >window-setup-hook</b>
(which is executed at startup time) calls
<b  >my-window-setup-hook</b>, which first sets the
foreground and background colors for the window, and then enables
Font Lock Mode.</p><p>You must enable Font Lock Mode separately for each buffer
that you wish to use it in. For this reason, I have Emacs call
<b  >my-turn-on-font-lock</b> whenever I enter C Mode,
Emacs LISP Mode, or Perl Mode:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'my-turn-on-font-lock)
(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'my-turn-on-font-lock)
(add-hook 'perl-mode-hook 'my-turn-on-font-lock)
</pre><p>The best way to determine how to configure faces to your
liking is to experiment with the code given above. There are
several variables which control which faces Font Lock Mode uses for
particular kinds of code. For example,
<b  >font-lock-comment-face</b> is the face used for
comments. By default, its value is italic, which we set above to
use the foreground color of lightsteelblue. You can either set the
face properties for bold, italic, and so on directly, or you can
operate on <b  >font-lock-comment-face</b>,
<b  >font-lock-function-name-face</b>, et cetera. Using
<b  >M-x apropos</b> and entering
<b  >font-lock</b> will give you a list of functions and
variables associated with Font Lock Mode.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1132580.0x1223678"></a>Using tags</h2></div></div><p>Emacs has a number of features dealing with tags, which are
simply marked locations in your source code. The most common use of
tags is to mark the beginning of a function definition. You can
then jump directly to that function definition, no matter what
source file it lives in.</p><p>To handle tags, Emacs uses a tags file, which is (by default)
named TAGS in the directory where your source files live. Before
experimenting with tags, let's create a tags file. From the shell
prompt, use the command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
etags filenames...
</pre><p>where filenames are the names of the source files in the
current directory. For example,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
etags *.c *.h
</pre><p>This will create the file TAGS, based on the C source and
header files in the current directory.</p><p>Let's say that we have three source files: grover.c, oscar.c,
and telly.c. These files might contain code such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/* grover.c ********************/
int grover() {
  /* Code for grover... */
}
/* oscar.c *********************/
int oscar() {
  /* Code for oscar... */
}
/* telly.c *********************/
int telly_monster() {
  /* Code for telly_monster... */
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  /* Code for main... */
}
</pre><p>Running etags on these three source files will create tags
for each function in the three files. (Using
<b  >etags</b> with the <b  >-t</b> option will
also include any <b  >typdef</b>s found in the
source.)</p><p>Now, we can use commands such as <b  >M-</b>.
(that's meta-dot) which will find a given tag. When we press
<b  >M-</b>. while editing one of these source files,
Emacs will ask us:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Find tag: (default oscar)
</pre><p>You can enter the name of a tag (function name), such as
<b  >telly_monster</b>, and the source file containing
that tag will automatically be opened, and point set to the line
containing the tag. This is a very quick way to move between source
files when editing.</p><p>The default tag for <b  >M-</b>. is set based on
whatever word point is currently on. Therefore, if point is
currently over a call to the function oscar(), pressing
<b  >M-.</b> followed by <b  >RET</b> will take
us directly to the definition of
<span   class="bold"><b>oscar()</b></span>.</p><p><b  >M-x find-tag-regexp</b> will find the tag
matched by the given regular expression. Therefore, using
<b  >find-tag-regexp</b> and giving a portion of the
function name will take you to that function (assuming that the
regular expression that you specified was unique for that
function). If you have a set of similarly-named functions, using
<b  >M-0 M-</b>. (that's meta-zero meta-dot) will take
you to the next tag matched by the previous use of
<b  >find-tag-regexp</b>.</p><p>Similarly, you can use <b  >M-x tags-search</b>,
which will search for the named regular expression in any of the
files named in the current TAGS file. That is,
<b  >tags-search</b> does not limit its search for
tags-it will search for any text in the files listed in TAGS. You
can use <b  >M-</b>, to search for the next instance of
the given regular expression.</p><p>Another useful feature is tags completion. Pressing
<b  >M-TAB</b> will attempt to complete the current word
based on functions listed in the current tags file. Therefore, when
calling the function telly_monster, we can type <b  >tel
M-TAB</b> which will complete the name for us. If a given
word has more than one completion, a
<b  >*Completions*</b> buffer will be opened, listing all
possible choices. Under X, pressing mouse-2 on a completion will
select it.</p><p>There is one caveat associated with using tags&mdash;you will
occasionally need to refresh the TAGS file, in case you have done
major reorganization of your code. Emacs doesn't depend on the TAGS
file being 100% accurate&mdash;it will search for a tag if it is not
found in the exact location given in the file. However, if you
mangle your code considerably, re-run etags to refresh the tags
database.</p><p>Also note that Emacs can use more than one TAGS file at a
time. Most tags-based functions assume use of the file TAGS in the
current directory. If you are editing source files spread across
several directories, <b  >M-x visit-tags-table</b> can be
used to load another TAGS file into Emacs' list of known tags.
Alternately, you can set the variable
<b  >tags-table-list</b> to a list of files or
directories where TAGS files can be found. For example, I might
want Emacs to always know about tags found in common library
routines. In my Emacs startup file, I would use something
like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(setq tags-table-list '("~/lib" "~/src/lib" "~/common"))
</pre><p>The TAGS files found in the named directories would be used
in addition to TAGS in the current directory.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1132580.0x1224598"></a>Updating the Change Log</h2></div></div><p>Many programs are accompanied by a ChangeLog, which describes
updates and modifications to the source on a day-to-day basis.
Emacs allows you to semi-automatically update the ChangeLog, using
the command <b  >M-x add-change-log-entry</b> (or,
<b  >C-x 4 a</b>, which will do the same in another
window).</p><p>For example, let's say that we're editing the source file
grover.c, and we add a bit of code to grover(). To document this
change, we use <b  >C-x 4 a</b>, which will open a window
containing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Sun Jul 24 14:39:50 1994 Matt Welsh (<a href="mailto:mdw@loomer.debian.org">mdw@loomer.debian.org</a>
)
        * grover.c (grover):
</pre><p>This command determines that we are within the function
grover(), in the file grover.c, and indicates this at the beginning
of the entry. We can now enter a new log entry and save the file in
the usual way. Each source file that you add entries for will be
given its own item.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1132580.0x1538e58"></a>Compiling and debugging code</h2></div></div><p>You can compile programs, and even run a debugger, entirely
within Emacs. The most basic compilation command is
<b  >M-x</b> compile, which will run
<b  >make</b> (or another command of your choice) in the
directory of the current buffer.</p><p>The default compilation command is <b  >make
-k</b>.</p><p>(The <b  >-k</b> switch will prevent make from
halting on an error which has no bearing on other targets in the
makefile.) When using <b  >M-x compile</b>, you will be
prompted for the compilation command to use, and also whether you
wish to save any buffers that have changed. If you wish to change
the default command, set the variable
<b  >compile-command</b> to another value. For
example,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(setq compile-command "make")
</pre><p>will cause <b  >M-x compile</b> to run
<b  >make</b> without the <b  >-k</b>
argument.</p><p>You can also set a value for
<b  >compile-command</b> for a particular source file.
This is done by including &ldquo;local variable definitions&rdquo; within the
source file itself. For example, we could include the following
comments within a C source file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/* Local Variables: */
/* mode: C */
/* compile-command: "make" */
/* End: */
</pre><p>These comments set the values of the mode and compile-command
variables for the buffer containing this code. When the file is
opened by Emacs, it recognizes the line containing Local Variables:
and uses subsequent lines, until the line containing End:, to
assign values to variables for this buffer alone. You can use this
feature to set values for any Emacs variables specific to this
buffer.</p><p>Now, when we use <b  >M-x compile</b>, Emacs runs
the given compilation command (here, <b  >make</b>) in
another window, with which we can monitor the progress of the
compilation. To kill the compilation process, type <b  >C-c
C-k</b> in the compilation buffer.</p><p>Once the compilation completes, we can use the error messages
printed (if any) to automatically visit the source which caused the
errors. For example, let's say that we use <b  >M-x
compile</b> and the following errors result:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /amd/noon/c/mdw/test/lj/
make
gcc -O -O2 -I/usr/include -I. -c main.c -o main.o
In file included from main.c:12:
libpx.h:30: image.h: No such file or directory
libpx.h:31: misc.h: No such file or directory
make: *** [main.o] Error 1
Compilation exited abnormally with code 1 at Sun Jul 24 16:32:17
</pre><p>Instead of manually locating libpx.h and jumping to the line
in question, you can move point to the error message in the
compilation buffer, press <b  >C-c C-c</b>, and the
source corresponding to the error is automatically visited. You can
then correct the bug, move to the next error, and repeat. Under X,
pressing <b  >mouse-2</b> on an error message in the
compilation buffer will jump to the corresponding source
line.</p><p>If you have a large number of error messages, pressing
<b  >M-n</b> in the compilation buffer will move to the
next error message (in addition to viewing the corresponding
source). To cause <b  >M-n</b> to have this behavior
within the C source buffer as well, you can use the following
command in your Emacs startup file: (<b  >define-key c-mode-map
"\M-n" 'next-error</b>)</p><p>To simplify the compilation process, I use the following code
within my Emacs configuration file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(defun my-save-and-compile ()
  (interactive "")
  (save-buffer 0)
  (compile "make -k"))
(define-key c-mode-map "\C-c\C-c' 'my-save-and-compile)
</pre><p>This defines a new function,
<b  >my-save-and-compile</b>, which will automatically
save the current buffer and run <b  >make -k</b>. This
saves me the hassle of answering the various prompts given by
<b  >M-x compile</b> alone. Now, using <b  >C-c
C-c</b> within a C Mode buffer will save the source and
compile it.</p><p>Once you get used to the above mechanism, fixing bugs and
recompiling code becomes quite painless&mdash;you can concentrate on
debugging and let Emacs locate the errors, run make, and so
forth.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1132580.0x1539cc8"></a>Running gdb</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>gdb</b></span> is the GNU debugger. It
is indispensable for run-time debugging for programs written in
nearly any compiled language, most notably C.
<span   class="bold"><b>gdb</b></span> can also be used for
post-mortem examination of a crashed program using a core
file.</p><p>Not surprisingly, Emacs provides a number of features which
allow you to run gdb within an Emacs buffer, interacting with the
corresponding source buffers to view and edit code. While gdb
deserves a tutorial of its own, here we will introduce you to the
Emacs-specific gdb features. gdb provides extensive online help,
which can fill in the gaps left here. For the rest of this
tutorial, we assume that you have basic familiarity with gdb, or a
similar debugger such as dbx.</p><p>Let's take the following short program, which will
un-doubtedly cause a segmentation fault on most systems:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 #include
int main(void) {
  int i; int *data = NULL;
  data[0] = 1;
  data[1] = 2;
  for (i = 2; i &gt; 30; i++) {
    data[i] = data[i-1] + data[i-2];
  }
  printf("Last value is %d0,data[29]);
}
</pre><p>As you can see, we're attempting to write data into a NULL
pointer. Sure enough, when we compile and run the program, we
obtain:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
loomer:~/test/lj/crashme% ./crashme
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
</pre><p>Let's use gdb to inspect the problem. Using <b  >M-x
gdb</b> gives us the prompt:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Run gdb (like this): gdb
</pre><p>Here, you should complete the gdb command line. In this case,
we want to run gdb on the executable crashme, with the core file
core. So, we complete as so:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Run gdb (like this): gdb crashme core
</pre><p>Emacs should open two windows&mdash;one containing the gdb
interaction session, and the other containing the source file
crashme.c. The gdb session will look something like:</p><p>GDB is free software and you are welcome to distribute copies
of it under certain conditions; type <b  >"show
copying</b> to see the conditions. There is absolutely no
warranty for GDB; type <b  >"show warranty"</b> for
details.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
GDB 4.12,
Copyright 1994 Free Software Foundation, Inc...
Core was generated by "crashme".
Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.
#0  0x22bc in main () at crashme.c:5
(gdb)
</pre><p>We can now issue gdb commands to inspect the crash.
Immediately, we notice that the crashme.c buffer contains an arrow
pointing to the current source line, as so:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
=&gt;data[0] = 1;
  data[1] = 2;
  /* ... */
</pre><p>This arrow is not part of the source text. It can't be
selected, modified, or deleted. You are free to edit the code in
the source buffer; this imaginary arrow will not be saved with the
edited code. The arrow only exists to let us know what gdb's idea
of the current source line is. Note, however, that adding or
deleting lines from the source buffer will cause gdb's information
about the location of source lines to be out-of-sync with the
actual code.</p><p>We can see that the crash was caused by a segmentation fault
on line 5, pointed to by the arrow. Using the where command in the
gdb buffer will give us a stack trace, and so on. You can correct
the code in the source buffer, recompile, test, and re-run gdb (if
necessary), all within Emacs.</p><p>gdb can also be used to inspect running programs. For
example, we can run crashme under gdb's control, and step along a
line at a time. First, however, let's correct the bug by changing
the definition of data to</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int data[30];
</pre><p>(Otherwise, crashme would crash on the first line of code,
and we'd have scant little to go on by way of
demonstration.)</p><p>First, we should set a breakpoint on the first line of code.
Within the gdb buffer, we can use list to display the first few
lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 (gdb) list
1       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
2       int main(void) {
3         int i;
4         int data[30];
5
6         data[0] = 1;
</pre><p>The command break 6 will set a breakpoint at line 6:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(gdb) break 6
Breakpoint 1 at 0x22b0: file crashme.c, line 6.
</pre><p>Now, the run command will begin execution of the program, but
will halt immediately on the first line of code. A buffer for
crashme.c will be opened, with our friendly arrow pointing at the
line containing the breakpoint.</p><p>Now, we can employ gdb's various commands directly, by
entering them in the gdb buffer&mdash;or, we can use the Emacs key
equivalents. Placing point on a line of code in the source buffer
and typing <b  >C-x C-a C-b</b> will set a breakpoint at
that line. Similarly, <b  >C-x C-a C-d</b> will delete
all breakpoints on that line. (The gdb command info break will list
the current breakpoints.) After setting a breakpoint, you can use
<b  >C-x C-a C-r</b> to resume execution.</p><p>All of the above commands can be used within the gdb buffer
as well, using <b  >C-c</b> instead of <b  >C-x
C-a</b> as the prefix. For convenience, <b  >C-x
SPC</b> in either buffer will set a breakpoint on the current
source line.</p><p>If you find these key bindings unnecessarily lengthy, as I
do, you might consider rebinding the functions
<b  >gud-break</b>, <b  >gud-remove</b>, and
<b  >gud-cont</b> within <b  >c-mode-map</b>.
For example, I use the commands</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(define-key c-mode-map "\M-b" 'gud-break)
(define-key c-mode-map "\M-d' 'gud-remove)
(define-key c-mode-map "\M-r" 'gud-cont)
</pre><p>Of course, this negates the previous meanings of
<b  >M-b</b>, <b  >M-d</b>, and
<b  >M-r</b> within C Mode.</p><p>The following additional macros are available within the gdb
buffer, as well as within C Mode by changing the prefix from
<b  >C-c</b> to <b  >C-x C-a</b>.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >`C-c C-s'</b> Step one line of code,
descending into function calls. (The gdb step command.)</p></li><li><p><b  >`C-c C-n'</b> Step one line of code,
without descending into function calls. (The gdb next
command.)</p></li><li><p><b  >`C-c &lt;'</b> Move up one stack
frame. (The gdb up command.)</p></li><li><p><b  >`C-c &gt;'</b> Move up one stack
frame. (The gdb down command.)</p></li><li><p><b  >`C-c C-f'</b> Run until the
completion of the current function, and then stop. (The gdb finish
command.)</p></li></ul></div><p>Again, you may wish to bind these to shorter key sequences
(such as <b  >M-s</b>, <b  >M-n</b>, and so
on).</p><p>Another interesting command is <b  >C-x C-a
C-p</b>, which will (within the source buffer) take the C
expression around point and pass it to gdb's print command, which
evaluates the expression and prints its value. This is very handy
way to examine variables, data structures, and so forth within the
debugger. You can even use this command to call functions and print
the return value, if you're executing the debugged program within
gdb.</p><p>For example, placing point on the line</p><pre     class="programlisting">
printf("Last value is %d\n",data[19]);
and pressing C-x C-a C-p will cause the following to be printed in the
gdb buffer:
(gdb)
$1 = 16
</pre><p>In this case, data[19] is 0, because we haven't executed the
calculation loop yet. Nevertheless, we can call functions within
the program (or, in fact, any arbitrary function, using the print
command manually) and examine the return value.</p><p>Emacs also allows you to define your own functions for
interacting with the debugger. For example, we might want to move
the point to a line of code, and run the gdb until function, which
will cause execution to continue until that line is reached.</p><p>This is accomplished with the <b  >gud-def</b>
function. For example, we can use (<b  >gud-def my-until-line
"until %f:%l""\C-u" "Run until current line."</b>)</p><p>This will define the function my-until-line which sends the
string</p><pre     class="programlisting">
until %f:%l
</pre><p>to the gdb process, where <b  >%f</b> is replaced
with the current source filename, and %l is replaced with the
current line number. The new function will be bound to the key
sequence <b  >C-x C-a C-u</b> (in the source buffer), and
<b  >C-c C-u</b> (in the gdb buffer). The final argument
is the documentation string for the command, printed using
<b  >describe-function</b>.</p><p>Now, we can place point on a line of code in the source
buffer, type <b  >C-x C-a C-u</b>, and execution will
continue until that line of code is reached.</p><p>We can customize interactions with the debugger in another
way. For example, gdb lacks the inherent ability to automatically
step along code, allowing us to monitor the execution of the
program without interruption. A similar effect can be achieved by
using the step command many times in succession, but we'd like
Emacs to automate the process for us.</p><p>This can be accomplished using the following function:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(defun gdb-step-forever (arg)
  (interactive "NTime between steps: ")
  (while -t
    (progn
      (sit-for arg)
      (gud-step 1))))
</pre><p>Running this function as <b  >M-x
gdb-step-forever</b> will prompt us for the amount of time to
sleep between steps, in seconds. (This need not be an integral
number of seconds&mdash;you can specify real values such as 0.5.) The
function will then pause for the given amount of time, run
<b  >gud-step</b>, and repeat, ad infinitum. To interrupt
the function, you can use the Emacs quit key,
<b  >C-g</b>.</p><p>A more general extrapolation of this idea would allow us to
run a &ldquo;hook&rdquo; function between steps, which would allow us to print
the values of variables, and so on.</p><p>Note that the above function isn't very intelligent&mdash;if it
runs into a breakpoint, or the program ceases execution for some
reason, it will continue to loop naively. In these cases, you can
simply interrupt the function by hand.</p><p>Given the above tour, you should be ready to tackle the other
programming features that Emacs provides&mdash;including version
control, customized indentation styles, and so forth. Perhaps a
future issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> will cover these aspects of
Emacs.</p><p>I welcome all suggestions, comments, and corrections for the
