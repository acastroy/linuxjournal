    The secratary of this volunteer group gives us the scoop on
    two Linux distributions.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12d0580.0x13c83f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Linux Review Group is a group of
Linux users willing to donate some of their spare time to testing
Linux distributions. We have approximately forty testers, plus one
secretary; me. Each time a distributor wants his product tested by
us, five of our testers get a copy of it and review it according to
a few criteria that we've chosen. This is all volunteer work, so
now and then someone drops out and doesn't deliver his report.
Therefore, I cannot guarantee that all the products we've looked at
have been tested by as many as five people.

<b  >ftp.mcc.ac.uk</b> in
<b  >/pub/linux/mcc-interim/1.0+</b>. It's available at
<b  >nic.funet.fi</b>, <b  >tsx-11.mit.edu</b>,
and <b  >sunsite.unc.edu</b></p><p>The best thing about MCC is the documentation: a 60+ page dvi
document guides the user through the installation. There are also
ASCII excerpts from this file.</p><p>The installation is menu-driven. The menus are not fancy (no
color, scroll bars, etc.), but error conditions (i.e., no disk in
drive) are caught.</p><p>There are couple of problems. The descriptions of the
packages are a tad too short, and don't say whether each package is
recommended or optional. Also, it displays the disk space use of
each package after it has been installed. It would be nice to get
that information before choosing whether to install a
package.</p><p>Compared to Slackware, this is a pretty slim package. No
soundcard support, no X-Windows, no TeX, etc. One tester complained
that some of the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; utilities that he was used to from
Slackware were missing. How-ever, instructions for getting these
parts are included. MCC only takes about 30MB of disk space; ideal
if you're a newcomer to Linux and would like to try it out. There
is no UMSDOS support, however, so you'll have to repartition your
disk.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12d0580.0x13c8920"></a>Linux Quarterly&mdash;Spring 1994</h2></div></div><p>This is a commercial CD-ROM distribution from Morse
Telecommunications.</p><p>A very polished package, Linux Quarterly comes with an MS
Windows installation program. One of our testers wasn't able to get
this installation program to run, but that might have been due to
some local misconfiguration. The documentation is well-written and
fairly complete. Of course, like most Linux material, it's not
intended for the computer novice, but if you have some previous DOS
or Unix experience, it'll do fine.</p><p>The CD contains about everything you'll want or need,
including MCC, Slackware, an image of the Linux area on tsx-11,
etc. It can provide hours of fun for the inquisitive. Free tech
support is included in the package.</p></div></div>
