purchased and enjoyed issue #3, and I just wanted to write to say
thank you for this terrific publication. It's terrific to have a
legitimate source for Linux info, and to find so many resources for
Linux.</p><p>Thanks again; I really like <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>&mdash;Peter Horadan <a href="mailto:peteho@halcyon.com">peteho@halcyon.com</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c9d580.0x1d953a0"></a>A Port in a Storm</h2></div></div><p>I've read an issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> and
I think it's great. I will probably be sending in a subscription
soon.</p><p>In the issue I read (Vol. 1, Ed. 2), there was a request for
questions. One thing I would like to see is a definitive review of
multi-port serial boards. I'm sure that there are a lot of people
like me who want to find a good board that is supported by Linux
(without having to make several patches to the kernel).</p><p>If you plan to do such an article or have already done one,
please let me know.</p><p>&mdash;Jason Funk <a href="mailto:jasonfunk@aol.com">jasonfunk@aol.com</a></p><p><i  >LJ</i> replies:</p><p>We had one article about the newly-supported Cyclades board
in issue #5. It is currently the only smart serial board supported
by the kernel. Digiboard will probably be supported later. All dumb
serial boards that use a UART with a FIFO like a 16450 or 16550
(almost all of them) are pretty much equivalent, and most are
supported in the standard kernel.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c9d580.0x1d95768"></a>Virtual Reality??</h2></div></div><p>I just read your post to c.o.l.announce; part of which was a
preview of the contents of the September issue. I'm particularly
interested in the article &ldquo;Writing an Intelligent Serial Driver&rdquo;,
by Randolph Bentson because that is what I am doing! Is this an
introductory article or does it document a real project to
implement intelligent serial I/O on Linux?</p><p>BTW, I subscribe to <i  >LJ</i> and look forward to reading it each
month. I was particularly impressed with the recent article about
the history of Unix. I'd also like to see more &ldquo;real world&rdquo;
examples of using Linux like the comic example this month.</p><p>&mdash;Simon Allen <a href="mailto:simonallen@cix.compulink.co.uk">simonallen@cix.compulink.co.uk</a></p><p><i  >LJ</i> replies:</p><p>The article (which was printed in <i  >Linux Journal</i> issue #5)
does indeed document a real project: implementing a driver for the
Cyclades 8Ys intelligent serial board.</p><p>We have a policy of publishing articles about Linux being
used in the real world. However, they are sometimes hard to find
out about. Therefore, if any readers know of Linux being used in
the &ldquo;real world&rdquo; in an interesting way, please send us a letter at
ljeditor@ sunsite.unc.edu and tell us about it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c9d580.0x1d95b88"></a>Shopping with <i  >Linux Journal</i></h2></div></div><p>I saw where you requested feedback on page 19 of the June
issue. I subscribe and am shopping for a Linux machine, which I'll
probably buy preloaded from an ad in <i  >LJ</i>. I was already a customer
of SSC, which helped me make the journey from DOS/Mac to Unix. I'm
delighted that SSC got into Linux; it's a perfect match image-wise.
The only thing better would be you guys cooperating with O'Reilly
or something. There's a nice feel to the Journal and a nice mix of
hard stuff (over my head but challenging) and beginner
stuff.</p><p>&mdash;<a href="mailto:SEAKAYAKER@delphi.com">SEAKAYAKER@delphi.com</a></p><p><i  >LJ</i> replies:</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>We do have a good working relationship with O'Reilly. We have
subscribers there, and we read and recommend their books. O'Reilly
is also helping to work on Linux documentation, working with the
Linux Documentation Project. We mention their new books in the New
Products section when they send us press releases which relate to
Linux; see the New Products section in this issue.</p><p>All letters to the editor are subject to editing for clarity,
length, grammar, and spelling. Send letters to
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a> and
use a subject like LTE. Alternately, send paper mail to <i  >Linux Journal</i>, P.O. Box 85867, Seattle, WA 98145-1867. E-mail is
preferred, because we can print the results of a discussion, which
can be more useful than just your letter and our response.</p></div></div>
