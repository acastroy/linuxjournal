    Being a new administrator for your Linux system can be very
    trying at times. When maintaining your system, you want to
    be able to manage it in an organized fashion. Unix
    Interactive Tools makes the task of running a smooth system
    easy.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b6580.0x18ae450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Unix Interactive Tools enables users to
view and handle their file-system with ease. The software package
itself is made up of three main components: a file browser, process
viewer/killer, and a Hex/ASCII viewer. With these tools, new system
administrators can complete the necessary duties of overseeing
their new kingdom more quickly and efficiently.
</p><p>The file system browser is made up of two side-by-side
panels. Each displays the current working directory of the user who
initiated the UIT session. Inside the panels, along with the
directory listing, is info about the files themselves (permissions,
size, etc). The windows can be easily navigated using the cursor
keys and the page-up and page-down keys. These keys move a
highlighted bar which shows the current file/directory selected.
The ENTER key is used as well, to move in/out of the highlighted
directories. Lastly, the file browser contains a shell-like command
line, for typing in normal shell commands, and also has a status
bar which contains optional &ldquo;hot-keys&rdquo;. These keys contain such
commands as move, copy, and mkdir.</p><p>The UIT package also includes a process viewer/killer. Like
the file browser, this process utility can be navigated by the user
via the cursor keys. Similar to the file browser, the viewer has a
status line with certain hot-keys that can be used. The process
viewer/killer lists all the current processes the user is running,
or if you are running UIT as root, it shows all the processes that
are running. Other things listed are the PID (Process ID) number
and the TTY (terminal used by the process). The viewer's ability to
examine/manipulate a process quickly and efficiently serves a
functional purpose in the lives of new (and experienced) system
administrators. This tool wouldn't be used for a &ldquo;quick glance&rdquo; of
the processes running, such that <b  >ps -aux</b> would
provide. It is more of a detailed outlook at the processes.</p><p>The last component of the UIT package is a Hex/ASCII file
viewer. It can be used to view and edit executables or data files.
This is a great tool for those who have done assembly in DOS, for
they can recognize the structure that the Hex/ASCII viewer
resembles.</p><p>I highly recommend the UIT package for new administrators
because of its usefulness in providing a global view of any
particular filesystem. This package enables users to maintain their
system efficiently, without having to worry about which shell
command to use, how to pipe to an output file, etc. It's all in
there, and the UIT package makes it simple. I don't recommend using
the UIT package without first learning some of the basic Unix
commands, though, because there are times when you may want to use
that nifty shell command line that comes in the file
browser!</p><p>Unix Interactive Tools was written by Tudor Hulubei and
Andrei Pitis. The current version for UIT is 4.3a. The complete
source to the UIT package can be found at ulise.cs.pub.ro, in the
/pub/public/linux/uit directory. Check it out, and tell me what you
think!</p></div></div>
