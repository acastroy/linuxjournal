Lite documentation set released by O'Reilly and USENIX</p><p>The BSD documentation set has always been a valuable
reference for Unix programmers and administrators. The new 4.4
release will be of even more use, both because the entire set has
been updated and because documentation for many free programs not
orignally part of the BSD distribution, including many of the GNU
utilities, has been included. For this reason, and also because
Linux distributions include some BSD utilities, these manuals may
be useful to Linux programmers and administrators. The full set of
five manuals is available for $120 (ISBN: 1-56592-077-5). In
addition, the entire 4.4BSD-Lite distribution is available on CD
for $40, and the complete manual set with the CD for $150.</p><p>For more information, contact O'Reilly &amp; Associates, 103
