    Confused over the many flavors of Linux CDs? Here, Phil
    Hughes gives us a brief summary of what's out there.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d3580.0x24cb348"></a></h2></div></div><p>As the Linux movement has grown, so has
the size of a Linux distribution. Buying a CD-ROM is now the only
practical way to get a complete distribution. Fortunately, as the
amount of code has grown, so have the buyer's choices in terms of
distributions on CDs. And it continues to grow every month.
</p><p>Linux is a very stable product with some people running
distributions many months old. (Our server system at
<i  >Linux Journal</i> is running a distribution from
October, 1993.) But each new release offers new features and new
bug fixes. This means that new CDs are appearing virtually weekly.
Here are some shopping hints.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d3580.0x24cb500"></a>Distributors, Packagers and ?</h2></div></div><p>Although the name Linux really applies to the kernel,
packages that include this kernel with lots of utilities and
applications are commonly called Linux packages. Some of these
packages are designed for a specific (and generally non-commercial)
purpose. Others are designed specifically to be a retail product
and others are a combination of the two.</p><p>To add to the confusion, there are the companies that develop
the content of the CD and have them manufactured and there are
companies that just distribute CDs manufactured by others or
include mostly a distribution developed by someone else.</p><p>As the distinction between someone who has developed their
own package and one who just sells code gets muddled more and more,
the real issue comes up: is the product supported? Will the company
that sold you the CD (or the manufacturer of the CD) offer you
support if you need it?</p><p>This doesn't necessarily mean free support or support
included with the product. The amount of support you can expect
with a $20-$50 package is minimal, although that minimal
&ldquo;hand-holding&rdquo; to get the package initially running might be
important.</p><p>Some people are buying Linux to &ldquo;hack&rdquo;. If this is the case,
support is probably not an issue. But if you plan to have the
operation of your company depend on Linux (which is happening more
and more today), make sure you can get the support you need before
you jump in. That said, on to what is available.</p><p>Yggdrasil Computing is clearly the biggest of those who make
their own package. Yggdrasil put together their own package (the
first was called LGX and the current product is called
Plug-and-Play) by selecting from available code. They then
developed their own installation package running under X-Windows
and made other decisions independent of most other Linux
development.</p><p>Yggdrasil (and Yggdrasil distributors) sells a package which
includes a boot disk and 90-page manual for $34.95. On the plus
side, you get a shrink-wrapped complete package. But on the down
side, you get Yggdrasil's idea of the system layout and utilities,
making it harder to add other software at a later time.</p><p>If you want to follow the development mainstream, there are
choices. The most popular Linux package today is Slackware,
produced by Patrick Volkerding. It followed the general idea of the
SLS package, which was to have an easy installation method that
would allow the addition of more packages. The package has been
freely distributed on the Internet, which means that it has most of
the kinks worked out. Pat never intended to make such a package (he
just wanted to clean up a few problems with SLS) but it just
happened because it worked so well.</p><p>Many commercial packagers jumped on the Slackware bandwagon,
including Trans-Ameritech, Morse Commu-nications and InfoMagic. But
they did it in different ways. Trans-Ameritech produces a CD that
includes Slackware plus BSD. The CD comes with bootable kernels and
programs to write the floppy boot disks. The CD is $29.95.</p><p>Morse Communications produces The Linux Quarterly. They try
to add value to each CD produced. The Spring 1994 edition includes
programs that run under Microsoft Windows that allow you to read
documentation and build the boot disk. It also includes the
complete contents of the <b  >tsx-11.mit.edu</b> archive
site. This CD is $29.95.</p><p>Morse also has a Linux Professional package that consists of
Pat Volkerding's Slackware and Matt Welsh's Installation and
Getting Started book in a shrink-wrapped package. [At the time of
this writing we haven't seen this package; it may contain other
things as well.] It sells for $49.95.</p><p>InfoMagic has decided to offer everything available in the
way of code at a reasonable price. Their current distribution
consists of two CDs which include all the Linux archives on both
<b  >tsx-11.mit.edu</b> and
<b  >sunsite.unc.edu</b> as well as the GNU archive from
<b  >prep.ai.mit.edu</b>, all of the Linux HOWTO
documents with a browser that runs under Microsoft Windows, and the
complete Slackware 2.0, SLS 1.0.5, Debian 0.91 beta and TAMU 1.0A
distributions. The two-CD set sells for $20.00.</p><p>Other vendors who offer Linux on CD-ROM (but haven't yet sent
us their products to review) include Red Hat Software, Nascent
Technologies, S.u.S.E. GmbH (Germany) and Unifix Software GmbH
(Germany).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d3580.0x24cbb88"></a>Good Shopping</h2></div></div><p>This information is current as of the end of July. By the
time you read this there will probably be a new player or two and
the current manufacturers may have new products. The current
&ldquo;production&rdquo; kernel for Linux is 1.0.9 and the development kernel
is 1.1.32. (If the second digit is even it is a production kernel
built for stability. If it is odd it contains new features and is
more likely to have bugs.)</p><p>If you want to be on the leading edge of development you may
need to do some serious shopping. If, however, you just want a
stable version of Linux, any of the distributions that contain a
1.0.x kernel should fill the bill. In any case, welcome to the
exciting Linux movement.</p></div></div>
