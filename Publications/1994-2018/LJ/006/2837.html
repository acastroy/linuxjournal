</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12fb580.0x13f33f8"></a>Summary: you thought you were already
paranoid?</h2></div></div><p>Cheswick and Bellovin have written the first book that deals
specifically with the security of whole networks rather than of
individual hosts. Based on their experience administering the
Internet firewall at AT&amp;T, as well as on existing papers and
reports, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Firewalls and Internet Security</em></span> tells
you how to connect a network to the Internet without exposing all
your computers to nefarious attacks. It begins with an introduction
to security issues and a review of TCP/IP protocols from the point
of view of security, but the reader is assumed to have a good
understanding of the TCP/IP, an understanding of basic security
concepts and some knowledge of Unix.</p><p>The core of the book is a detailed look at how to set up and
run a firewall. This begins by covering the mechanics of setting up
a packet filter, application and circuit gateways, the uses and
abuses of tunneling and the general limitations of firewalls. A
long chapter then goes into some detail in describing the
application level gateway setup at AT&amp;T. Also contains a brief
discussion of user authentication and a description of useful tools
such as connection libraries, network monitors and logging
programs. (They recommend doing a lot of logging.) Also discussed
are counter-intelligence measures, decoys and lures, and how to use
standard hacking tools to test your security yourself. The stress
throughout is on keeping things simple, in traditional Unix
style.</p><p>Cheswick and Bellovin then look at how things actually work
in practice. Here they present a general typology of network
attacks, an account of their encounter with the infamous 'Berferd'
hacker in 1991, and some statistics on penetration attempts from
their logs. I'm a bit unsure about some of the conclusions they
draw from the latter (see below), but it's good to see some
statistics being published.</p><p>To round things off there are chapters on legal issues (if
you watch a hacker instead of kicking him off at once, are you
responsible for any damage he does while using your system to
connect elsewhere?) and cryptography. The appendix contains a list
of free resources - software packages and information sources -
available to those trying to maintain secure networks, a port by
port analysis of TCP and UDP protocol weaknesses and some
suggestions for vendors and manufacturers of networking hardware
and software.</p><p>This is great stuff, and I have only one quibble. I feel
Cheswick and Bellovin are a little too paranoid in places, not in
their evaluation of possible threats or in the precautions they
suggest, but in their evaluation of the intensity of hacking
activity. So attempts to rlogin in to their gateway as root, while
they may be &ldquo;evil&rdquo;, are almost certainly due to bored university
undergraduates - I should think it's the last thing a competent
hacker would try. (Of course competent hackers probably have more
sense than to attack a hardened target like AT&amp;T at all, let
alone head on.) Attempts to log in as guest, demo or visitor are
surely signs of cluelessness, and hardly deserve to be labelled
&ldquo;attacks&rdquo; or &ldquo;evil&rdquo;. And a graph which is supposed to show that
hackers are less active on weekends, to me suggests instead that
most of their &ldquo;penetration&rdquo; attempts are from company employees or
university students who don't even have net access on weekends.
Using the term &ldquo;hacker&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;cracker&rdquo; for those up to no
good is one thing; debasing the term to include everyone capable of
typing &ldquo;rlogin research.att.com -l root&rdquo; is another. It's a far cry
from that to being able to mount sequence number attacks on TCP
connections.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Firewalls and Internet Security</em></span> has no
rival; while much of the information it provides is available
elsewhere, no comparable summary exists. Anyone in charge of
installing or administering an Internet firewall would be insane
not to get a copy. And while some of it is irrelevant to smaller
sites, much will be useful to anyone concerned with TCP/IP network
security. That said, it should be pointed out again that this is
not an introductory book on security; not only does it assume a
solid knowledge of internet protocols, but it doesn't deal with
anything except external network threats. Of course anyone with
pretensions to being an Internet hacker will also want to read this
book (if only to find out why they shouldn't try to crack AT&amp;T
:-) and it can be read just for enjoyment. As well as being
extremely informative, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Firewalls</em></span> is also
extremely entertaining, with the authors managing to inject some
lightheartedness into their subject while still respecting its
seriousness. I finished my copy within a day of receiving
it.</p><p>Declaration of interest: I requested and received a review
copy of <span   class="bold"><b>Firewalls and Internet
Security</b></span> from Addison-Wesley, but have no stake,
financial or otherwise, in its success.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Firewalls and Internet Security</em></span> -
