    Most Linux users have at least heard of Makefiles, but many
    do not know how powerful a program make is. It is thought of
    as a tool for maintaining other programs, but it is far
    more. It can make sense out of chaos in any project where
    some files are created from other files, whether the end
    product is a program or a book or an automated post to
    Usenet. Even if you have never written a makefile, this
    tutorial will set you on your way to using make effectively.

do not know how powerful a program make is. It is thought of as a
tool for maintaining other programs, but it is far more. It can
make sense out of chaos in any project where some files are created
from other files, whether the end product is a program or a book or
an automated post to Usenet. Even if you have never written a
makefile, this tutorial will set you on your way to using
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> effectively.</p><p>by Michael K. Johnson</p><p>Many people are confused by
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span>: maybe you are too. You know
that it is hard to use, because it has a weird syntax unlike any
other program you use. If you are lucky, you have been warned that
it is important to have tab characters (not spaces) in certain
places, and you know that if you mess up a makefile you won't be
able to fix it.</p><p>Writing a makefile of your own is out of the question. It is
difficult, and besides, you aren't really a programmer, anyway.
What could this programmer's maintenance program do for you, and
why should you learn its weird syntax? Or maybe you are a
programmer, and you don't want to learn this tool called make,
which has a syntax different from any language you have ever
learned.</p><p>The reason for the weird syntax is that make does a job very
different from normal programming tools, and it is well-suited to
that very different job. Understanding the job is the first step to
understanding make. Once you understand the job, and have learned a
little bit about make, you will be able to write short, powerful
makefiles.</p><p>We will pretend for the moment that you are writing a book,
although the exact same ideas apply to writing a program. (I just
want to emphasize that make isn't just for Real Programmers.) You
are using LaTeX. Each chapter has several figures. These figures
are done in xfig, and need to be converted to PostScript format
with fig2dev before being included in your book.</p><p>Here comes the problem. You are occasionally editing the
figures with xfig, and forgetting to make a PostScript copy of each
figure when you are done, so you write a large shell script that
converts xfig to encapsulated PostScript (EPS) for each figure. It
is large, bulky, and inflexible, but you get the job done right
each time you print. Unfortunately, it takes a while to convert all
the files from xfig to encapsulated PostScript. Even if you have
only made a minor change in one figure, it re-converts all of your
figures. This is annoying, and takes a while for it to convert your
80 or so figures.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cb5580.0x1dad818"></a>Welcome to the wonderful world of make</h2></div></div><p>The intelligence of make is summarized by two concepts:
dependencies and rules. You need to tell make that the dvi file
(we'll call it book.dvi) needs to be created from the main LaTeX
file (book.tex), and from the encapsulated PostScript files
(*.eps). In make terminology, book.dvi depends on book.tex and
*.eps. Also, each of the .eps files depends on the corresponding
.fig file. You also need to give make rules for turning book.tex
into book.dvi, and for turning the .fig files into .eps
files.</p><p>Newbie Note:All lines containing shell commands in your
makefile must start with the TAB character.</p><p>Here is an example of a makefile that will do everything that
is necessary:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
0:  # This is a makefile to create book.dvi
1:  EPSFIGS = fig1.eps fig2.eps fig3.eps fig4.eps \
2:  fig5.eps fig6.eps fig7.eps fig8.eps fig9.eps \
3:   &lt;... more .eps files, too many to print ...&gt; \
4:   fig78.eps fig79.eps fig80.eps fig81.eps
5:
6:  book.dvi: book.tex $(EPSFIGS)
7:          latex book.tex
8:
9:  fig1.eps: fig1.fig
10:         fig2dev -Lps fig1.fig fig1.eps
11:
12: fig2.eps: fig2.fig
13:         fig2dev -Lps fig2.fig fig1.eps
14:
&lt;many more similar rules that you can imagine&gt;
220:
</pre><p>This file can be saved as <b  >makefile</b> or
<b  >Makefile</b>; either will work. If you have both
files in the same directory, <b  >makefile</b> will be
used instead of <b  >Makefile</b>. In addition, there are
other names that can be used and rules to control that. See the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>GNU Make</em></span> manual if you care (you usually
won't). People almost always use <b  >Makefile</b>
because capital letters show up at the top of directory
listings.</p><p>The first line, line 0, is a comment. Line 1 starts to define
the variable EPSFIGS. The backslashes continue the line, so the
EPSFIGS variable contains the names of all the EPS files from
fig1.eps through fig81.eps, and logically all those lines are
really one long line. Line 6 tells make that if book.tex or any of
the .eps files are newer than book.dvi, then book.dvi has to be
recreated. Line 7 explains how to do this. It is very important
that this line start with a TAB character. This is how make knows
that this is a shell command to be executed to update the
dependency that preceeds it. Eight spaces will not work. Spaces can
follow a tab, but the first character on that line must be a TAB.
The rest of the lines work the same way: line 9 says that fig1.eps
depends on fig1.fig, and line 10 tells make how to update fig1.eps
from fig1.fig if fig1.fig has been updated since the last time
fig1.eps was created.</p><p>Simply typing <b  >make</b> will automatically make
book.dvi, because the first target in the makefile (here consisting
of lines 6 and 7) is the <span   class="bold"><b>default
target</b></span>. You could conceivably type <b  >"make
fig1.eps"</b> to just update fig1.eps from fig1.fig, and that
only if necessary. If it is not necessary, make will tell you
<b  >"fig1.eps is up to date."</b></p><p>The basic syntax of a makefile can be simplified to
this:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Any line can be continued onto the next line by
making the last character of the line be a backslash
character.</p></li><li><p>Variables are defined with lines containing an
equal sign: <b  >FOO=bar</b>.</p></li><li><p>Variables are referenced by enclosing them in
parentheses (or curly braces, but parentheses are preferred and are
more portable) and prepending a dollar sign:
<b  >$(FOO)</b> (or <b  >${FOO}</b>).</p></li><li><p>Files are made to depend on others by putting the
file that is created before a colon, and a list of files needed to
create or update that file after the colon, on the same
line.</p></li><li><p>A list of shell commands for creating or updating
the file follows that line directly on lines with a TAB character
as the very first character. Each line is run by a separate
invocation of the shell, so a cd command on one line will only have
effect on that line. To make successive lines be part of the same
shell invocation, append &ldquo; ;\&rdquo; to the line to make the next line
really be another part of the same line.</p></li><li><p>Comments begin with the &ldquo;#&rdquo; character.</p></li></ul></div><p>Knowing those six very simple rules will allow you to
maintain most makefiles that you will find on the Internet, and
will allow you to create almost any makefile you need. However--
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cb5580.0x1dae4d0"></a>Don't get satisfied yet</h2></div></div><p>This makefile works until you define fig82.fig and forget to
translate it into fig82.eps. It is also far longer than it needs to
be. I will rewrite it to be much smaller, and at the same time work
better. I'm going to assume that you are using GNU make, which is
the standard make on Linux and some other systems. It is very easy
to build on most other systems that you may have.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
0: # This is an improved version of the makefile for
1: #  making book.dvi
2: # FIG is a list of all the native xfig drawings
3: FIG = $(wildcard *.fig)
4: # EPS is a list of EPS files to create from the xfig files
5: EPS = $(subst .fig,.eps,$(FIG))
6:
7: %.fig : %.eps
8:          fig2dev -Lps $&lt; $@
9:
10: book.dvi: book.tex $(FIG)

12:
13: print: book.dvi
14:         dvips -r -Z -q book.dvi
</pre><p>This makefile does everything that the previous one did, and
more. It introduces several new concepts along the way, some of
which are unique to GNU make. The first, and perhaps the most
obvious, is that I did not explicitly list all the .fig or .eps
files. Listing all the files requires me to update the makefile
each time I add a figure, which is rather error-prone. Using the
GNU make wildcard function allows the makefile to automatically
update the files correctly, no matter how many figures you add. If
you choose to use it, be careful that you really mean to list all
the files, and be aware that it will not work under most commercial
vendors' versions of make.</p><p>GNU make has many functions like wildcard. Like variables,
they are enclosed in <b  >$(...)</b> (or
<b  >${...}</b>), but you can distinguish functions from
variables because the functions have embedded spaces. The name of
the function comes first, with the argument, or comma-seperated
list of arguments, following. They are all documented in Chapter 9,
&ldquo;Functions for Transforming Text&rdquo;, in the GNU Make manual. wildcard
is equivalent to the shell &ldquo;globbing&rdquo; that you use every day on the
command line (like <b  >ls *.fig</b>) and subst works
like a very simple version of sed (like <b  >sed
's/\.fig/\.eps/g'</b>), replacing each instance of one
substring in a string by a different substring.</p><p>Another GNU make feature used is called a &ldquo;pattern rule&rdquo;.
This is like a &ldquo;suffix rule&rdquo; as used in all versions of make
(suffix rules still work in GNU make, don't worry), but is more
powerful. The example given here is equivalent to the suffix
rule</p><pre     class="programlisting">
.fig.eps:
        fig2dev -Lps $&lt; $@
</pre><p>but the pattern rule is a more general construct. Pattern
rules may by preferable if you are writing makefiles for yourself
or for projects where you can guarantee that GNU make will be used,
and suffix rules are preferable if you are trying to write portable
makefiles for all platforms.</p><p>The reason pattern rules are more powerful than suffix rules
is they can match any sort of pattern, not just suffixes. For
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
foo.% : bar.%
</pre><p>would be a &ldquo;prefix rule&rdquo;, which does not exist in other forms
of make. Patterns are a more general concept than suffixes, and can
be used in other ways in other kinds of rules. The GNU Make manual
has examples of this.</p><p>The variables <b  >$&lt;</b> and
<b  >$@</b> are special variables that can be used in
rules. The <b  >$@</b> variable stands for the file that
is being updated, the target which depends on the files that follow
the &ldquo;:&rdquo; in the dependency. The <b  >$&lt;</b> variable
stands for the files upon which the target depends. This is a
standard make facility, and does not require GNU make.</p><p>Finally, this makefile uses a standard trick of defining a
target that doesn't exist. Typing <b  >make print</b>
will print a copy of your book with everything up-to-date, even
though there is no file called print. Similarily, since the first
target is the default target, many makefiles have the first rule be
a rule called &ldquo;all:&rdquo; which does whatever seems right when
&ldquo;everything&rdquo; is to be built. In fact, the practice of typing &ldquo;make
all&rdquo; instead of just &ldquo;make&rdquo; is so common that even when there is
only one program to be built by default, some people will add an
all target to their makefile even though it is not at all
necessary:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
0: all: foo
1:
2: foo: foo.o bar.o baz.o
       &lt;and so on&gt;
instead of
0: foo: foo.o bar.o baz.o
       &lt;and so on&gt;
</pre><p>This is only a taste of make. The GNU Make manual is a
gentle, but much more thorough and correct introduction to GNU
make, and is distributed with the GNU make source code. It does not
assume that you already know how to use any version of make. On a
properly installed system, it is available through the info system.
The info files can be read from within Emacs (type <b  >C-h
i</b> from within Emacs) or from a standalone info reader
such as info or tkinfo. Alternately, the book can be printed with
the TeX typesetting system or ordered from the Free Software
Foundation.</p></div></div>
