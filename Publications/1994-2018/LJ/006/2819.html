    Jeff gives us a head-start for learning C++ on our own.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24e8580.0x25e03f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Object-Oriented programming is a hot
topic in the computer industry these days, and most experts agree
that C++ is the predominant object-oriented programming language.
Many programmers are familiar with the C programming language and
would like to move to C++, but feel they lack the necessary tools
and resources, particularly if the training has to be done on their
own time.
</p><p>It should therefore come as welcome news to learn that Linux
makes an ideal platform for learning C++. This article covers some
of the C++ programming tools available under Linux and refers the
reader to additional resources, many of them freely available on
the Internet.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24e8580.0x25e0558"></a>Resources</h2></div></div><p>By resources, I am referring to sources of information that
will help you learn C++ and solve programming problems.</p><p>A large number of books on C++ and object-oriented design and
programming are available, some better than others. The three I
suggest here are among the most popular of those that are specific
to C++; you may be able to borrow a copy from your local public,
school, or corporate library. As these concentrate more on the C++
language itself, you may wish to supplement them with books that
cover object-oriented analysis and design.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The C++ Programming Language</em></span>

relevant and can be very useful, both as a source of answers to
specific questions and for picking up the latest developments in
C++ and object-oriented programming:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >comp.lang.c++</b></p></li><li><p><b  >comp.std.c++</b></p></li><li><p><b  >comp.object</b></p></li></ul></div><p>The following Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) lists are
periodically posted to Usenet, and are available by anonymous FTP
from Internet archive sites (listed in brackets):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>C++

you use one of the standard Linux distributions you probably have
most of these already, otherwise you can get them from a major
archive site. To save time and disk space, I suggest obtaining the
Linux binaries rather than building them from source.</p><p>The standard Linux C++ compiler is GNU g++ from the Free
Software Foundation. It follows the evolving ANSI C++ standard and
supports most features found in AT&amp;T's cfront 3.0 compiler,
including templates. It does not yet support exceptions.</p><p>Unlike cfront, which is a preprocessor, g++ generates native
code. As the compiler is evolving quickly, I recommend getting the
latest version. (At the time of writing most Linux distributions
included version 2.5.8; version 2.6.0 had just been
released.)</p><p>Gdb is the GNU symbolic debugger; you have probably used it
already for debugging C programs under Linux. It supports most C++
data types and language constructs, and transparently handles C++
&ldquo;name demangling&rdquo;. Gdb runs well inside Emacs, or you can use the
xxgdb graphical user interface under X. The documentation for gdb,
in info format, describes the features specific to C++
debugging.</p><p>The programmer's editor of choice, Emacs, has a C++ mode that
assists in editing. It works well in conjunction with gdb and g++,
allowing you to compile and debug from within the editor.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24e8580.0x25e17e8"></a>Class Libraries</h2></div></div><p>If you want to run any meaningful programs, such as examples
from a textbook or code of your own, you will want some class
libraries. A number of C++ class libraries are available under
Linux.</p><p>The GNU libg++ library provides the standard C++ iostream
class. It also includes a number of additional useful classes, from
complex numbers to general-purpose stack, queue, and set objects.
Since the source is freely available, you can read it to understand
how the libraries were implemented. Libg++ is well documented in
the included info pages.</p><p>InterViews is an object-oriented toolkit for graphical user
interface programming in C++. It is included as the &ldquo;iv&rdquo; series in
the Slackware distribution of Linux. A new version of InterViews is
included in the recently released revision 6 of the X Window System
(X11R6), under the name Fresco. Fresco has been sucessfully
compiled with GNU g++ version 2.6.0.</p><p>NIHCL, the National Institutes of Health Class Library, is a
portable C++ translation of the Smalltalk-80 class library, by
Keith Gorlen of NIH. The source is available on the Internet from
FTP site alw.nih.gov in the directory /pub/NIHCL. At time of
writing NIHCL would not compile under g++; this should be corrected
in a future release.</p><p>ObjectBuilder is a graphical user interface builder for the
OI C++ toolkit. It is designed to simplify the development of
X11-based user interfaces. The Linux version is freely distributed
in binary format; the same product is sold commercially by
ParcPlace Systems for other computing platforms.</p><p>If, as some experts recommend, you want exposure to a &ldquo;pure&rdquo;
object-oriented language, you can investigate GNU Smalltalk. The
GNU gcc compiler also supports Objective-C, another object-oriented
language based on C and Smalltalk. Both of these tools are
available as packages under Slackware Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24e8580.0x25e1aa8"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>Becoming proficient in C++ takes time and effort, but you can
gain a career advantage by learning it on your own using Linux. I
suggest trying an iterative approach which alternates between
reading books and writing your own code. You may also want to
consider some formal training.</p><p>Ideally you will be able to find a mentor to guide you and
answer questions as you embark on your C++ education. More likely,
you will find yourself the mentor for co-workers who will learn
from your mistakes. I wish you success in your journey.</p></div></div>
