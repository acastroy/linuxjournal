If and when you get stuck
working on a Rails application, some of
these techniques will help you identify and solve the problem more
quickly than before.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c9c580.0x1d94358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The past few months, I've covered a number of automated
testing systems available to Ruby programmers in general and Rails
developers in particular. Automated testing, especially when you
use it before and while you develop (as opposed to afterward) is a
terrific way to improve the quality of your design, as well as the
robustness of your code. Whether you practice TDD (test-driven
development), BDD (behavior-driven development) or something similar
to the two, your software is likely to have fewer bugs and be more
maintainable than its untested counterparts.
</p><p>
So, does that mean software written in this way has no bugs?
Let's not be silly&mdash;of course it does. But, if you have been serious
about testing, you are likely to have fewer bugs, and they may
well be harder to detect and more subtle.
</p><p>
If the bugs are smarter (or craftier), your debugging and testing
tools need to be smarter too. Fortunately, as the Ruby language and
the Rails framework for Web development have become increasingly
popular, a number of talented developers have stepped up to the plate,
offering a variety of sophisticated tools that can help you
identify and squash bugs as they occur.
</p><p>
This month, I describe a few of the tools that I use when developing
Web applications using Ruby on Rails. If and when you get stuck
working on a Rails application you are developing, I hope some of
these techniques will help you identify and solve the problem more
quickly than before.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c9c580.0x1d94618"></a>
Look at the Logfiles</h2></div></div><p>
I'm a big fan of logfiles. When something goes wrong on my computer
or in a program I've written, my first instinct is to check the
logs. When I am teaching a class in Rails development, and people
ask why their program doesn't work, my first response always is to
ask them what the logfile says. It can be an invaluable starting
point for debugging problems.
</p><p>
Fortunately for me, the Rails core team also likes logfiles quite a
bit. Each environment&mdash;and there are three by default, for
development, testing and production&mdash;has its own logfile, named
log/ENVIRONMENT.log, under the application's root directory.
</p><p>
Just what is put into the logfile depends on the settings you
have made. By default, the development logs include a great deal more
detail than the production logs, showing you (among other things) the
actual SQL queries that are being sent to the database. Each log
message has a level associated with it, much as you might have seen in
other logging systems, such as Apache or log4j. A logged message is
written to the logfile only if it is at least as important as the
current environment's minimum logfile priority (in increasing order of
priority: debug, info, warn, error and fatal). Thus, a fatal log
message always will be written to the log, while a debug message
will be written only if the current environment's log level is
debug.
</p><p>
The logfile is useful in at least two ways. First, it allows
you to see what is happening inside your program as it executes,
particularly when something goes wrong. In the development
environment, a fatal error will produce a stack trace in both the
browser and in the logfile. But in the production environment, you
probably don't want the world to see the internals of your code's
flaws. For this reason, stack traces appear only in the production
log, while the browser shows an error message. Tracing through a
logfile is, as I stated earlier, my favorite way to figure out what is
happening in a program.
</p><p>
In addition to the stack backtrace, the logs (and particularly the
development logs) contain a wealth of other information, as you can
see from this short example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Processing ReviewController#view_one_review (for 74.212.146.115 
at 2009-11-10 09:25:55) [GET]
  Session ID: 9513bd79785b3d037804b45709a1f12c
  Parameters: {"id"=&gt;"2567"}
Rendering template within layouts/one-review.rhtml
Rendering review/view_one_review
Completed in 1400ms (View: 16, DB: 973) | 200 OK
[http://example.com/book_reviews/view_one_review/2567]
</pre>
</p><p>
The first line shows the date and time when the request
was made, the controller and action that were invoked, and the URL (at
the bottom of the log entry) that caused that controller and action to
be invoked. It shows that the HTTP response code was (200, or
&ldquo;OK&rdquo;)
and how long it took to execute, giving you a rough sense of
how efficient a particular method might be. And, you even get a
breakdown of how long the database and view each took, allowing you to
focus your optimization strategy on the truly needy methods in your
system.
</p><p>
You also get the full list of parameters that were submitted to the
controller action. This has been particularly useful to me on
numerous occasions when I get calls from clients. Being able to look
at the parameters that were submitted to the controller action allows
me to test those precise parameters and trace their usage through
the system.
</p><p>
Finally, you can see which view templates were rendered. Especially on a
site with a complicated set of views, it's often helpful to know just
what is being invoked and displayed.
</p><p>
In the development environment, you also will see things like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Parameter Load (1.9ms)   SELECT * FROM "parameters"
          WHERE ("parameters"."param_name" = E'Blocked IPs'
          AND "parameters"."param_group" = E'Restrictions') LIMIT 1
PaymentMethod Load (2.0ms)   SELECT * FROM "payment_methods"
          WHERE (disabled = false) ORDER BY payment_method_name
State Load (6.5ms)   SELECT * FROM "states" ORDER BY abbreviation
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, you can see when objects are being initialized from the
database and what queries are being used in order to do this.
</p><p>
So far, I've shown how you can use the default output in Rails
logfiles to find useful information about what your application is
doing. But I often find it useful to write information to the logfile
as well, indicating where I am in the code or that a particular task
has been accomplished. For example, on a bookstore application that I
worked on with a complicated pricing algorithm, I would log
each calculation in that pricing algorithm to the logfile. This would
allow us to &ldquo;replay&rdquo; the algorithms as users saw them and
double-check our work in a variety of ways.
</p><p>
To log information to the Rails logs, simply use the logger object
and send it a message corresponding to the log level you want to use.
For example, if you want to know whether a product is in stock, you could
say:


<pre     class="programlisting">
logger.warn "Checking to see if ISBN '#{isbn}' is in stock."
if Isbn.in_stock?(["isbn = ? ", isbn])
  logger.warn "\tYup, we have it!"
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Such &ldquo;chatty&rdquo; logs might be slightly inefficient, but they make it
easier to read (and follow) what is going on inside your program,
on the occasions when you need to read the logs to debug problems.
Remember, you are creating these logfiles knowing you will
need to read them someday, and by making them as enjoyable, flowing
and enlightening as possible, you will make that experience far more
pleasant.
</p><p>
I tend to use the warn level for most things I write to the logs and
use debug when I want something to appear only in the development
logs. If I have to display a complex data structure, I often
will display it using YAML, with the .to_yaml method. This makes it
easier to understand structures, particularly when you're 
interested only in one or two of its attributes.
</p><p>
I'm also a heavy user of <tt  >tail -f</tt> on logfiles, which allows me to see
the logfile as it grows. Combined with grep, this makes it possible
to search for the occurrence of particular methods, values or
anything else that might appear in the logfile. For example, you can
look for every mention of a Person object with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tail -f log/development.log | grep Person
</pre>
</p><p>
If I want to peek at a value across many different invocations, I
sometimes will put a special marker, such as the method name, in my
logger call, by putting the following in a controller method:


<pre     class="programlisting">
logger.warn "[interesting_method] The value is '#{foo}'."
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that I put single quotes around the value; this allows me to
identify whitespace and empty strings more easily. I then can see
whenever this code is invoked:


<pre     class="programlisting">
tail -f log/development.log | grep interesting_method
</pre>
</p><p>
Although I most commonly look at the development log (while writing code)
and the production log (on a running server), I also have found
occasion to look at the testing log, which shows the results of
running tests. (If you are testing with Cucumber, realize that it has
its own environment and logfile.)

Use the Console</h2></div></div><p>
I have been using logfiles to assist me in debugging and development
for years, starting long before I began to use Rails. But logfiles
allow you to see only what has happened in the past, passively. One
of the best tools in a Rails developer's toolbox is the console, an
interactive command-line interface that allows you to query, execute
and test commands and variable values. If you are familiar with
Ruby's &ldquo;irb&rdquo; for interactive work, the console will be familiar
to you.
</p><p>
The console often is the first place that I write any code. It puts
you in a context similar to that of a controller, allowing you to talk
to the database via ActiveRecord, creating (and modifying and
destroying) objects and assigning them.
</p><p>
For example, I often play around with associations and named scopes
within the console, testing that I easily can retrieve one object
through another or retrieve a subset of objects using a method call.
For example, if I have a Person object and a Vehicle object, I should
be able to say Person.new.vehicles in the console and get the empty
array. Or, I should be able to use a named scope to say Person.men,
retrieving only the men from the database.
</p><p>
I also use the console a great deal to test objects for validity. The
valid? method for ActiveRecord objects, coupled with the save! method
that raises an exception when a save goes wrong, allows me to test
objects to see whether ActiveRecord believes they're valid, and why. For
example, if I say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Person.new.save!
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c9c580.0x1d955e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I should get a list (not formatted beautifully, I admit) of the
validations that have failed&mdash;generally indicating which attributes
need to be set in order to save the person successfully. True, you
always could invoke the errors method on an object after a failed
save, but I find this to be faster and more obvious, which is
precisely why I'm in the console.
</p><p>
I often use the console to piece together the methods I am going
to use or just to experiment with code that eventually will go into a
class or module. If you modify a model definition while you're in the
console, you need to reload models with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
reload!
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c9c580.0x1d957a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
so that the console will be synchronized with the current state of the
source code.
</p><p>
By default, the console operates in the development environment,
so that when you write:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./script/console
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c9c580.0x1d95958"></a></h2></div></div><p>
you are talking to the development database.
</p><p>
I should note that there are a number of Ruby gems designed to improve
the irb experience. One of these is wirble, which colorizes and
otherwise improves the irb interface. I have been using it for a
while and find it hard to use irb without its various improvements.
</p><p>
A newer entry is looksee, which provides a new lp (lookup path)
method that shows each of the methods an object responds to,
categorized and sorted as a list of ancestors. Using lp has made it
easier for me to know just which class or module definition I need to
inspect to investigate a particular method.
</p><p>
If you want to use the console for a production environment, which I
often do when debugging problems on a production server, you will
need to state the name of the environment explicitly:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./script/console production
</pre>
</p><p>
I should add that recent versions of Rails include a similar command,
<tt  >dbconsole</tt>, which allows you to talk directly to the relational
database for the environment to which you're connected. I often use
dbconsole instead of typing <tt  >mysql</tt> or
<tt  >psql</tt> (depending on the system
I'm using). However, it's important to remember that when you work in
the Rails console, the objects are subject to validations and other
integrity checks that are not present in your raw connection to the
relational database. So for safety's sake, it's usually a good idea
to do things through Ruby, rather than the database. (Although if
your database supports transactions, you can get some element of
safety by doing all modifications within a BEGIN-COMMIT block.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c9c580.0x218df70"></a>
Debugger</h2></div></div><p>
The console, of course, is good for testing code, but you cannot run
your entire Rails application inside the console. There are times,
however, when you wish you could drop into the console just for a
portion of your Rails application to poke around inside it. True,
you could use logging statements to write the current state of affairs
to the logfile, but there's nothing like interactively exploring an
application from the inside to give you a better feeling about how it
is working (or not).
</p><p>
The solution to this problem is the deceptively simple ruby-debug gem,
which you can install (like all Ruby gems) by saying:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo gem install ruby-debug
</pre>
</p><p>
You then need to include the gem. This typically is done in the
development and/or test environment, but not in the production
environment, for obvious reasons. Inside of
config/environments/development.rb (or test.rb), you add:

<pre     class="programlisting">
require 'ruby-debug'
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c9c580.0x218e230"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and you're set to go!
</p><p>
Under most circumstances, ruby-debug will do absolutely nothing. It
won't affect your code, execution or anything else. But if you drop
the method:

<pre     class="programlisting">
debugger
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c9c580.0x218e3e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
into your Rails application, the application will halt when it gets to
that line and will give you a true debugger, looking something like
GDB. You get a few lines of context around the current line, you can
print current values (or any other expression) with the p command, and
you can move forward in the program on a line-by-line basis with the n
command. Your Web browser, which presumably triggers the debugger
when it invokes a particular controller action, will hang while you
are using the debugger, stepping through the code and inspecting the
environment.
</p><p>
To explore things more fully, you can drop into irb at any time,
getting another version of the Rails console. This is good when you
want to do something more than just examine variable values&mdash;exploring the database, for example, or drilling down into the innards
of the system.
</p><p>
Note that because of the nature of ruby-debug, it's really only
practical for use with HTTP servers that you run in the foreground,
such as WEBrick. But there's nothing stopping you from having two
different application instances (one using Phusion and one using
WEBrick) running in the same environment or working on the same
database&mdash;just make sure to run them on different ports and be sure
to keep track of multiple tabs that you might have open in your
Web browser.
</p><p>
I've only begun to use ruby-debug seriously in the past few months,
and I'm already wondering how I ever got along without it. If nothing
else, exploring my application from the inside gives me many insights
that I would never have had otherwise, and it gives me a chance to look
at things actively, rather than just using logfiles.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c9c580.0x218e5f8"></a>
Third-Party Options</h2></div></div><p>
Finally, you might want to try one or both of the commercial Rails
services that have sprung up, and which provide monitoring and
notifications for Rails applications. I should make it clear that
both of these are hosted by for-profit corporations, and that although
they are offering free versions of their products, their ultimate goal
is presumably to make money.
</p><p>
New Relic RPM is a performance monitor that you install into your
Rails application as a plugin. Every few minutes, the plugin reports
your current application status back to New Relic's servers, where the
data is then made available in an easy-to-understand format. New
Relic's basic offering is free, and although it is much more limited than
the commercial versions, I have found it to be highly useful in
giving me a snapshot of the current system performance and
bottlenecks. If and when your site brings in some money, it might
be worthwhile to pay for one of New Relic's commercial products,
which provide not only an indication of controller and server
performance from the last 30 minutes, but also from the last few weeks, as
well as more detailed analyses of memory, database and CPU use,
among other things.
</p><p>
Hoptoad, a service run by Thoughtbot, is similar to New Relic RPM, in
that it has a free version as well as a commercial one. Hoptoad is
similar to many notification systems, and it sends you e-mail when
an exception occurs in your application. However, it keeps track of
the entire stack trace and request context, and it also keeps a log of it
on Hoptoad's Web site, keeping similar errors together. You also
can indicate when you have resolved a problem, using it as a primitive
sort of bug-tracking application. (Although I find it annoying that
you receive e-mail only the first time a particular error
manifests itself, until you mark it as resolved.) Hoptoad has made
inroads into many Rails projects on which I have worked, and I have
found it to be more reliable and easier to use on my projects than
simpler exception-notification systems.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Debugging Web applications has never been easy, but the Ruby on Rails
community has managed to create a set of useful and powerful tools
that can make a big difference to average Web developers. Whether
you are a new developer or an experienced one, having these tools in
your toolbox can make you more effective at finding bugs and at
getting your application, bug-free, out the door for your customers.
