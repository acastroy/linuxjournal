Let KDE Konquer your Windows desktop.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe59580.0xf51250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Have you ever found yourself working on Windows&mdash;for whatever
reason&mdash;and reached for one of your favorite applications from the free software
world only to remember that it is not available on Windows?
</p><p>
It is not a problem for some of the best-known free software applications,
such as Firefox, Thunderbird, OpenOffice.org, GIMP or Pidgin.
However, for some popular Linux applications, such as those from the KDE desktop software project,
cross-platform support only recently became a possibility. KDE relies
on the Qt toolkit from Nokia, which has long been available under the
GPL for operating systems such as Linux that use the X Window System,
but it was available under proprietary licenses for Windows only until
the most recent series, Qt4. With the release of a GPL Qt for Windows,
KDE developers started work on porting the libraries and applications
to Windows, and the KDE on Windows Project was born. The project tracks
the main KDE releases on Linux and normally has Windows versions of the
applications available shortly after.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe59580.0xf51460"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
It is easy to try out KDE applications on Windows. Simply
go to the project Web site (<a href="http://windows.kde.org" target="_self">windows.kde.org</a>),
download and run the installer (Figure 1).
You'll be presented with a few choices to make, such as the installation
mode (a simple &ldquo;End User&rdquo; mode with a flat list of applications or the
&ldquo;Package Manager&rdquo; mode that is categorized like many of the Linux package
managers). You also are given the option of whether to install packages
made with the Microsoft compiler or those made with a free software
alternative&mdash;as
many users are likely neither to care about nor understand this option, it may
have been better to hide it in an advanced tab.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10639f1.large.jpg"><img src="10639f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. KDE on Windows Installer Welcome Screen
</p></div></div><p>
Next, you are presented with a choice of download mirrors, followed by the choice of which version
of KDE software to install. It's hard to imagine why you wouldn't simply
want the latest stable release, but the installer gives you a few options
and, oddly, seems to preselect the oldest by default. 
</p><p>
In the next step, you
are presented with a list of applications and software groups available
to install, or you can select everything (Figure 2). The installer then takes care of
downloading and installing the software, and you don't need to make any
further interventions. I did find that the speed of the various mirrors
varied greatly; some were up to ten times faster than others. If
you're short of time and things seem to be going slowly, it may be
worth canceling the download and trying another mirror. The installer
is intelligent enough to re-use what you already have downloaded, so
you don't really lose anything in this way. When the installation is
complete, your new KDE applications are available in a KDE Release
subsection of the Windows application menu.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10639f2.large.jpg"><img src="10639f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The installer provides a simple list of
applications available for installation.
</p></div></div><p>
The main KDE 4 distribution for Linux is split into large modules&mdash;for
example, Marble, a desktop globe application, is part of the KDE
Education module with many other applications for subjects ranging
from chemistry to astronomy. This works fine on Linux, where most of
what you need is installed with your chosen distribution. But, if you're
on Windows and want a desktop globe but have no interest in chemistry
or physics, there are clear benefits in preserving your download
bandwidth and hard-drive space by not downloading everything else. Patrick
Spendrin, a member of both the KDE on Windows and Marble projects, says
they recognize this issue: &ldquo;as one can see, we are already working on
splitting up packages into smaller parts, so that each application can
be installed separately.&rdquo; Many modules already have been split, so you
can install the photo management application digiKam, individual games
and key parts of the KDE software development kit separately from their
companion applications. The productivity suite KOffice will be split up
in a similar way in the near future, and Patrick hopes that the Education
module will follow shortly afterward.
</p><p>
Overall, the installation process will feel familiar and easy if you've
used Linux in the past. However, if you have used only Windows, the
process of using a single installer to install whatever applications you
want may seem a little strange. After all, most applications for Windows
are installed by downloading a single self-contained executable file that
installs the application and everything it needs to run in one go. The KDE
on Windows installation process reflects the fact that KDE applications
share a lot of code in common libraries. 
</p><p>
Patrick explains that individual
self-contained installers simply would not make sense at this stage:
&ldquo;the base libraries for a KDE application are around 200MB, so each
single application installer would be probably this size.&rdquo; A version
of Marble, however, is available from its Web site as a self-contained
installer&mdash;the map widget is pure Qt, so it is possible to maintain
both a Qt and KDE user interface wrapping that widget. The pure Qt
version is small enough to be packaged in this way. 
</p><p>
As Torsten Rahn,
Marble's original author and core developer puts it, having
a standalone installer for the full KDE version of Marble &ldquo;would increase the time a user
needs to download and install Marble; installing the Qt version takes less
than a minute.&rdquo; It might be possible in the future to package a common
runtime environment and provide applications as separate executables,
similar to the approach taken by Java applications, but Patrick notes
that this would take time, as &ldquo;it would be a lot different from the current
Linux-like layout.&rdquo; In any case, the current approach has some
advantages,
because it makes you aware of other available applications and allows
you to try them out simply by marking an extra check box.

First Impressions</h2></div></div><p>
The KDE 4 Windows install comes with a slimmed-down version of the System
Settings configuration module (Figure 3), which will be familiar to you if you've
used KDE 4 on Linux. Here, you can adjust KDE 4 notifications and default
applications in addition to language and regional settings. However,
these apply only to the KDE applications, so you can encounter slightly
odd situations. For example, if you open an image from Windows Explorer, it
will be shown by the Windows Picture and Fax Viewer, but if you open the
same file from KDE 4's Dolphin file manager, it will be opened with the
KDE image viewer, Gwenview. Of course, you can use the Windows control
panel to make Windows prefer KDE applications for opening images and
documents and change the file associations for Dolphin so that it will
use other Windows programs that you have installed, but you will need
to make adjustments in both places to get consistent behavior.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10639f3.large.jpg"><img src="10639f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The KDE System Settings module lets you
adapt the look and feel of KDE applications to match your system.
</p></div></div><p>
System Settings also allows you to choose a selection of themes for your
KDE applications, including some that tie in well with the Classic and
Luna themes in Windows XP. At present, KDE 4 doesn't include special themes
for Windows Vista or Windows 7. However, Windows users are accustomed
to using mismatching software from many different vendors, and the KDE
applications fit in as well as anything else.
</p><p>
Most of the applications I tried seemed just fine, at least to start
with. Konqueror, for example, correctly displayed the selection of
major Web sites I visited (Figure 4). However, after using the applications for a
while, I began to notice a less-than-perfect integration with the Windows
environment. Okular, the KDE document viewer, used the default Windows
dialog for open and save, with common Windows folders, such as Desktop and
My Documents, available on the left-hand panel. However, other applications,
such as KWord, used the KDE file dialog which, in common with the Dolphin
file manager, has links on the left-hand panel to Home and Root. These
labels probably will not mean a lot to a Windows user unfamiliar with a
traditional Linux filesystem layout, and it would be nice to see Dolphin
and KDE dialogs modified to show standard Windows folders, such as 
Desktop and My Documents instead.

State of the Applications</h2></div></div><p>
digiKam, the photo management application, is one of the real highlights
of the KDE world on Linux (Figure 5). On Windows, it started fine, found all my
images and allowed me to view a full-screen slideshow. I was able to use
its powerful editing tool to crop a photo and adjust the color levels
of an image, but when saving the modifications, I received an error
that the save location was invalid. digiKam was attempting to prepend a
forward slash (as found in a Linux filesystem) to the save location, so
that it read &ldquo;/C:/Documents and Settings...&rdquo;. A small error, but one
that makes practical use of the application difficult.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10639f5.large.jpg"><img src="10639f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. digiKam, the KDE photo manager, worked quite well, finding and
organizing my photos.
</p></div></div><p>
KOffice2, still experimental on Linux, seemed to
run quite well on Windows.
I was able to create a document, save it in OpenDocument format and
then open it in Okular. Windows users who primarily use Microsoft Office
and don't want to use another office suite might consider Okular as a
lightweight OpenDocument viewer.
</p><p>
One of my favorite KDE applications on Linux is Kopete, the universal
messaging application (Figure 6). I was able to log in to my Windows Live Messenger
account and chat to my contacts, but the XMPP protocol (used by Google
Talk) wasn't available. Integration with KDE's secure password storage
system, KWallet, also seemed imperfect, as I had to go through two rounds
of unlocking the wallet before Kopete appeared to have access to the
account passwords.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10639f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Kopete works well with the Windows Live
Messenger service but currently lacks XMPP support on Windows.
</p></div></div><p>
Dolphin, the file manager, seemed to work well (Figure 7), and its bread-crumb
navigation structure made rapid switches between folders easy. It felt
faster than Windows Explorer at loading thumbnails of images, and the
preview pane provides excellent file overviews without having to open
a dedicated application. If I spent a lot of time on Windows, I would
be tempted to try Dolphin as an Explorer replacement. As mentioned
previously,
Konqueror also handled everything I threw at it.

Figure 7. The Dolphin file manager is an attractive
and easy-to-use replacement for Explorer.
</p></div></div><p>
One notable application missing from the KDE installer is Amarok, the
popular music player. The Amarok Web site explains that the Windows port
is highly experimental and has been omitted from the KDE 4.3 release
of the KDE on Windows installer, although it was available on Windows
with KDE 4.2. In fact, no music or video player was available from the
KDE installer for version 4.3, which is a shame, as the Phonon technology
developed by KDE and integrated into Qt should make it easier than ever
before to make such applications truly cross-platform.
</p><p>
KDE 4 comes with a great selection of simple games built in, including the
likes of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hangman</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Battleships</em></span> and
a few more exotic options, such as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mahjongg</em></span> (Figures 8 and 9). Windows includes its own applications for playing many of these
games, but the KDE alternatives were highly impressive with beautiful
artwork. I encountered few problems that would give any indication
that they hadn't been designed for Windows in the first place&mdash;only
some problems saving partially completed games due to differences
between the Linux and Windows filesystem structures.

Figure 8. <span  class="emphasis"><em>KMahjongg</em></span> is beautifully presented and

Figure 9. <span  class="emphasis"><em>KHangMan</em></span> comes with a selection of nice
themes and worked flawlessly.

Going All the Way: Plasma on Your Desktop</h2></div></div><p>
The desktop shell in KDE 4 on Linux is provided by Plasma, a flexible,
integrated replacement for the separate desktop, widget and taskbar
applications of KDE 3. It is possible to run Plasma as the desktop
shell on Windows, but some major features are missing&mdash;such as a
taskbar&mdash;and you need to make some changes to the Windows Registry to
try it out. In fact, trying Plasma on Windows really is not a good idea
on any machine that you care about, because once you have made the switch, you
cannot easily revert it from within your KDE Plasma desktop
session. The
safest way to try Plasma on Windows is to use a new (and disposable)
user account in Windows running in a virtual machine. If you do try it
(see the Replacing the Windows Desktop Shell with KDE's Plasma sidebar for instructions), you'll be presented with a
pretty KDE desktop (Figure 10) to which you can add a few of your favorite
widgets, such as a clock or the KDE menu, run a few KDE applications and,
well, that's about it. Windows programs are entirely inaccessible.
Although there is a certain wow factor to having an almost complete KDE 4 desktop
on your Windows machine, using it is not really practical in any serious
way at present.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10639f10.large.jpg"><img src="10639f10.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. The KDE Plasma desktop shell running on
Windows&mdash;attractive, but not yet very functional.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe59580.0x134b650"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Replacing the Windows Desktop Shell with KDE's Plasma</b></p><p>
First, this is a really bad idea and may make your Windows system
unusable. If you must follow these instructions, use at least a spare user
account and preferably a disposable install in a virtual machine. You have
been warned.
</p><p>
If that has not put you off and you still want to see how Plasma looks on
Windows, you need to download and run Autoruns for Windows from
Microsoft (<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_self">technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a>).
</p><p>
Next, simply unzip the downloaded archive and run autoruns.exe (not
autorunsc.exe).
</p><p>
In the main program window that appears, you then have to select the Logon
tab and find the entry that references explorer.exe. Double-click on that
to open the registry editor and change the key to replace explorer.exe with
the full path to plasma-desktop.exe (if you accepted the default KDE
install options, this is probably C:\Program Files\KDE\bin\plasma-desktop.exe).
</p><p>
Log out and back in again. You should be presented with a pretty but
largely nonfunctional Plasma desktop.
</p><p>
You'll probably have to press the computer reset button to escape.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe59580.0x134ba70"></a>
Can KDE Succeed on Windows?</h2></div></div><p>
Some of the KDE applications are competing for your attention against
better-known alternatives that you easily can install from a single
executable file. KDE's Konqueror Web browser, although a fine application,
finds itself in a very crowded market for Windows browsers with
Internet Explorer already installed and the likes of Firefox, Opera,
Safari and Google Chrome all available as alternatives. The potential
for some other applications to become popular on Windows is, however, much
higher. Kopete faces only Pidgin and the proprietary Trillian messenger
as serious competition in the market for multiprotocol messaging
clients. Okular is a lightweight but well featured alternative to Adobe
Reader. Marble is almost in a class of its own&mdash;the nearest competitor
perhaps being Google Earth. Kontact, the Personal Information Management
suite, also has potential as a compelling cross-platform alternative
to existing solutions (Figure 11). Mozilla Thunderbird is a clear competitor,
but it lacks comprehensive calendar functionality. Benjamin Dietrich,
working in IT support at a German university, who currently has to support
many different mail applications across the various computing platforms,
believes Kontact could &ldquo;provide one solution, once it is as mature
as it is on Linux&rdquo;. However, a way to distribute Kontact as
a self-contained installer easily would add to its appeal: &ldquo;a single binary
installer would be perfect.&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10639f11.large.jpg"><img src="10639f11.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 11. KMail, part of the KDE Kontact Personal
Information Management suite, was able to connect to my mail server and
download my e-mail.
</p></div></div><p>
The spread of KDE applications to Windows also has had benefits for the
wider KDE Project. Amarok's integration with the Last.fm music service
was largely put together by a developer who used Windows rather than
Linux. It is unlikely that he would have become involved if it had
not been possible at the time to run Amarok on Windows. Getting exposure to
users on Windows also gives KDE the potential to attract users to trying
KDE 4 on Linux and should make the transition for such users easier if
they already know some of the applications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe59580.0x134be38"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The KDE on Windows Project still is quite young, and there are plenty
of rough edges in many of the applications and some notable gaps in
the application line-up. However, the installation process works well
and is straightforward for anyone who has used a package manager on
Linux. Although the installation process is different from that of most
Windows applications, the installer is sufficiently well designed that
it should not cause problems for most Windows users. The recent and
continuing work to split up applications so that users can install
exactly what they want also lowers the barriers to trying out KDE
applications in Windows. Some of the applications have great potential to
fill gaps in the Windows application world, particularly as free software
alternatives to proprietary applications. As the project Web site freely
admits, many of the applications may not yet be ready for day-to-day use,
but they are well worth checking out and will only get better.
