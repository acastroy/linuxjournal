Connect safely to the mother ship with a Linux VPN.

The other day, I was accompanying local IT security legend and excellent
friend Bill Wurster on his last official &ldquo;wireless LAN
walkabout&rdquo; prior to
his retirement (it was his last day!), looking for unauthorized wireless
access points in our company's downtown offices. As we strolled and
scanned,
we chatted, and besides recalling old times, battles won and lost, and one
very colorful former manager, naturally we talked about wireless security.
</p><p>
Bill, who has dedicated much of the past decade to wireless network
security work in various capacities, reiterated something all of us in the
security game have been saying for years: one of the very best things you
can do to defend yourself when using someone else's WLAN is to use a
Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection to connect back to some other,
more trustworthy, network.
</p><p>
You might think the main value of a VPN connection is to encrypt sensitive
communications, and that's certainly very important. But if you make your
VPN connection your default route and use your trusted network's DNS
servers, Web proxies and other &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo; systems to communicate
back out to the Internet (for example, for Web surfing), you won't have to
worry about DNS spoofing, Web-session hijacking or other entire categories
of localized attacks you might otherwise be subject to on an untrusted LAN.
</p><p>
For this reason, our employer <span   class="emphasis"><em>requires</em></span> us to use our corporate VLAN
software any time we connect our corporate laptops to any WLAN
&ldquo;hotspot&rdquo;
or even to our personal/home WLANs. So, Bill asked me, why don't you write
about making VLAN connections with Linux laptops?
</p><p>
This isn't the first good idea Bill's given me (nor, I hope, is it the
last). So this month, I begin a series on Linux VPNs, with special
attention to OpenVPN. I'd like to dedicate this series to Bill Wurster,
whose skill, creativity, enthusiasm and integrity have been such an
inspiration not only to me but also to a couple generations of coworkers.
Your warmth and wisdom will be sorely missed, Bill&mdash;here's wishing you a
long, happy and fun retirement!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18a8580.0x19a0930"></a>
VPN Basics</h2></div></div><p>
Rather to my surprise, the overview of VPN technologies in general, and
Linux VPN choices in specific, that I did in 2005 is still pretty current
(see Resources for a link to this earlier article). If you find the
overview I'm about to give to be too brief, I refer you to that piece.
Here, though, is a brief introduction.
</p><p>
To create a &ldquo;Virtual Private Network&rdquo; is to extend some
private network&mdash;for example, your home Local Area Network (LAN) or your employer's Wide Area
Network (WAN)&mdash;by connecting it to other networks or systems that aren't
physically connected to it, using some sort of &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; (non-dedicated,
non-persistent) network connection over network bandwidth not controlled or
managed by you. In other words, a VPN uses a public network (most commonly
the Internet) to connect private networks together.
</p><p>
Because by definition a public network is one over which you have no real
control, a VPN must allow for two things: unreliability and lack of
security. The former quality is mainly handled by low-level
error-correcting features of your VPN software. Security, however, is
tricky. 
</p><p>
You must select a VPN product or platform that uses good security
technologies in the first place (the world is filled with insecure VPN
technologies), and you must furthermore <span   class="emphasis"><em>enable</em></span> those security
features and resist the temptation to weaken them in order to improve VPN
performance (which is ultimately futile anyhow, as Internet bandwidth is
generally slower and less reliable than other long-range network
technologies, such as dedicated circuits). 
</p><p>
There are three categories of security we care about in this context:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Authentication: is the computer or network device trying to
connect to the trusted network an expected, authorized VPN endpoint?
Conversely, am I, the VPN client, really connecting to my trusted network or
has my connection request been redirected to some impostor site?
</p></li><li><p>
Data integrity: is my connection truly usable only by me and my
trusted network, or is it possible for some outsider to inject extraneous
traffic into it or to tamper with legitimate traffic?
</p></li><li><p>
Privacy: is it possible for an attacker to read data contained in
my VPN traffic?
</p></li></ol></div><p>
You may not need all three types of security. For example, if you're using
a VPN connection to transfer large quantities of public or otherwise
nonsensitive information, and are only using a VPN in the first place to
tunnel some not-normally-IP-routable protocol, you might consider a
&ldquo;null-encryption&rdquo; VPN tunnel. But even in that case, you should ask
yourself, what would happen if an attacker inserted or altered data in
these transactions? What would happen if an attacker initiated a bogus
connection altogether?
</p><p>
Luckily, some VPN protocols, such as IPsec, allow you to &ldquo;mix and
match&rdquo;
between features that address different security controls. You can, for
example, use strong authentication and cryptographic
error/integrity-checking of all data without actually encrypting the
tunnel. In most situations, however, the smart thing to do is leverage good
authentication, integrity and privacy (encryption) controls. The remainder
of this series assumes you need all three of these.
</p><p>
There are two common usage scenarios for VPNs: &ldquo;site-to-site&rdquo;
and &ldquo;remote-access&rdquo;. In a site-to-site VPN, two networks are connected by an encrypted
&ldquo;tunnel&rdquo; whose endpoints are routers or servers acting as gateways for
their respective networks. Typically, such a VPN tunnel is
&ldquo;nailed&rdquo; (or
&ldquo;persistent&rdquo;)&mdash;once established, it's maintained as an always-available,
transparent route between the two networks that end users aren't even aware
of, in the same way as a WAN circuit, such as a T1 or Frame Relay
connection.
</p><p>
In contrast, each tunnel in a remote-access VPN solution connects a single
user's system to the trusted network. Typically, remote-access VPN tunnels
are dynamically established and broken as needed. For example, when I work
from home, I establish a VPN tunnel from my company's laptop to the
corporate VPN concentrator. Once my tunnel's up, I can reach the same
network resources as when I'm in the office; with respect to computing,
from that point onward I can work as normal. Then at the end of the day,
when it's time to shut down my machine, I first close my VPN tunnel.
</p><p>
For site-to-site VPNs, the endpoints are typically routers. All modern
router platforms support VPN protocols, such as IPsec. Establishing and
breaking VPN tunnels, however, can be computationally expensive&mdash;that is,
resource-consuming. 
</p><p>
For this reason, if you need to terminate a lot of site-to-site tunnels on
a single endpoint (for example, a router in your data center connecting to
numerous sales offices), or if you need to support many remote-access VPN
clients, you'll generally need a dedicated VPN concentrator. This can take
the form of a router with a crypto-accelerator circuit board or a device
designed entirely for this purpose (which is likely to have
crypto-accelerator hardware in the form of onboard ASICs).
</p><p>
A number of tunneling protocols are used for Internet VPNs. IPsec is
an open standard that adds security headers to the IPv4 standard
(technically it's a back-port of IPv6's security features to IPv4), and
it allows you either to authenticate and integrity-check an IPv4 stream
&ldquo;in
place&rdquo; (without creating a tunnel per se) or to encapsulate entire packets
within the payloads of a new IPv4 stream. These are called Authentication
Header (AH) mode and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) mode,
respectively.
</p><p>
Microsoft's Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is another popular VPN
protocol. Unlike IPsec, which can be used only to protect IP traffic, PPTP
can encapsulate non-IP protocols, such as Microsoft NETBIOS. PPTP has a long
history of security vulnerabilities.
</p><p>
Two other protocols are worth mentioning here. SSL-VPN is less a protocol
than a category of products. It involves encapsulating application traffic
within standard HTTPS traffic, and different vendors achieve this in
different (proprietary) ways. SSL-VPN, which usually is used in remote-access solutions, typically allows clients to use an ordinary Web browser
to connect to an SSL-VPN gateway device. Once authenticated, the user is
presented with a Web page consisting of links to specific services on
specific servers on the home network.
</p><p>
How, you might ask, is that different from connecting to a
&ldquo;reverse&rdquo; Web
proxy that's been configured to authenticate all external users? For Web
traffic, most SSL-VPN products do, in fact, behave like standard Web proxies.
The magic, however, comes into play with non-HTTP-based applications, such
as Outlook/Exchange, Terminal Services, Secure Shell and so forth.
</p><p>
For non-HTTP-based applications, the SSL-VPN gateway either must interact
with a dedicated client application (a &ldquo;thick&rdquo; client) or it must push some
sort of applet to the user's Web browser. Some SSL-VPN products support
both browser-only access and thick-client access. Others support only one
or the other.
</p><p>
Thick-client-only SSL-VPN, unlike browser-accessible, can be used to
encapsulate an entire network stream, not just individual applications'
traffic. In common parlance though, the term SSL-VPN usually connotes
browser clients.
</p><p>
And, that brings us to the subject of the remainder of this month's column
and the exclusive focus of the next few columns: other SSL-based VPNs. As I
just implied, it's possible to encrypt an entire network stream into an SSL
session, for the same reason it's possible to stream audio, video, remote
desktop sessions and all the other things we use our browsers for
nowadays.
</p><p>
OpenVPN is a free, open-source VPN solution that achieves this very thing,
using its own d&aelig;mon and client software. Like PPTP, it can tunnel not only
IP traffic, but also lower-level, non-IP-based protocols, such as NETBIOS.
Like IPsec, it uses well-scrutinized, well-trusted implementations of
standard, open cryptographic algorithms and protocols. I explain how,
in more detail, shortly. But for overview purposes, suffice it to say that
OpenVPN represents a class of encapsulating SSL/TLS-based VPN tools and is
one of the better examples thereof.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18a8580.0x19a17a0"></a>
Some Linux VPN Choices</h2></div></div><p>
Nowadays, a number of good VPN solutions exist for Linux. Some
commercial products, of course, release Linux versions of their proprietary
VPN client software (so many more than when I began this column in 2000!).
</p><p>
In the IPsec space, there are Openswan, which spun off of the FreeS/WAN
project shortly before the latter ended; Strongswan, another FreeS/WAN
spin-off; and NETKEY (descended from BSD's KAME), which is an official part
of the Linux 2.6 kernel and is controlled by userspace tools provided by
the ipsec-tools package. All of these represent IPsec implementations for
the Linux kernel. Because IPsec is an extension of the IPv4 protocol,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> IPsec implementation on any operating system must be integrated
into its kernel. 
</p><p>
vpnc is an open-source Linux client for connecting to Cisco VPN servers (in
the form of Cisco routers, Cisco ASA firewalls and so forth). It also
works with Juniper/Netscreen VPN servers.
</p><p>
Although I don't recommend either due to PPTP's security design flaws,
PPTP-linux and Poptop provide client and server applications, respectively,
for Microsoft's PPTP protocol. Think it's just me? Both PPTP-linux's and
Poptop's maintainers recommend that you not use PPTP unless you have no
choice! (See Resources for links to the PPTP-linux and Poptop home pages.)
</p><p>
And, of course, there's OpenVPN, which provides both client and server
support for SSL/TLS-based VPN tunnels, for both site-to-site and remote-access use.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18a8580.0x19a1a60"></a>
Introduction to OpenVPN</h2></div></div><p>
All the non-PPTP Linux VPN tools I just mentioned are secure and stable.
I focus on OpenVPN for the rest of this series, however, for two
reasons. First, I've never covered OpenVPN here in any depth, but its
growing popularity and reputation for security and stability are such that
the time is ripe for me to cover it now.
</p><p>
Second, OpenVPN is much simpler than IPsec. IPsec, especially IPsec on
Linux in either the client or server context, can be very complicated and
confusing. In contrast, OpenVPN is easier to understand, get working
and maintain.
</p><p>
Among the reasons OpenVPN is simpler is that it doesn't operate at the
kernel level, other than using the kernel's tun and tap devices (which
are compiled in the default kernels of most mainstream Linux
distributions). OpenVPN itself, whether run as a VPN server or client, is
strictly a userspace program. 
</p><p>
In fact, OpenVPN is composed of exactly <span   class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> userspace program,
openvpn, that can be used either as a server d&aelig;mon for VPN clients to
connect to or as a client process that connects to some other OpenVPN
server. Like stunnel, another tool that uses SSL/TLS to encapsulate
application traffic, the openssl d&aelig;mon uses OpenSSL, which nowadays is
installed by default on most Linux systems, for its cryptographic
functions.
</p><p>
OpenVPN, by the way, is not strictly a Linux tool. Versions also
are available for Windows, Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and Mac OS X.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18a8580.0x1998608"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
2009: a Bad Year for SSL/TLS?</b></p><p>
OpenVPN depends on OpenSSL, a free implementation of the SSL and TLS
protocols, for its cryptographic functions. But SSL/TLS has had a bad year
with respect to security vulnerabilities. First, back in February 2009,
Moxie Marlinspike and others began demonstrating man-in-the-middle attacks
that could be used to intercept SSL/TLS-encrypted Web sessions by
&ldquo;stripping&rdquo; SSL/TLS encryption from HTTPS sessions.
</p><p>
These are largely localized attacks&mdash;in practice, the attacker usually
needs to be on the same LAN as (or not very far upstream of) the
victim&mdash;and they depend on end users not noticing that their HTTPS
sessions have
reverted to HTTP. The NULL-prefix man-in-the-middle attack that Marlinspike
and Dan Kaminsky subsequently (separately) demonstrated that summer was
more worrisome. It exploited problems in X.509 and in Firefox that made it
possible for an attacker essentially to proxy an HTTPS session, breaking
the encryption in the middle, in a way that allows the attacker to
eavesdrop on (and meddle with) HTTPS traffic in a way that is much harder
for end users to notice or detect.
</p><p>
But, that wasn't all for 2009 (which isn't even finished yet, as I write
this). In November, security researchers uncovered problems with how the
SSL/TLS protocol handles session state. These problems at least
theoretically allow an attacker not only to eavesdrop on but also inject data
into SSL/TLS-encrypted data streams. Although the effects of this attack
appeared similar to those of the NULL-prefix attack, the latter involved
client/browser-side X.509 certificate-handling functions that were
browser/platform-specific and didn't involve any server-side code.
</p><p>
In contrast, the November revelation involved actual flaws in the SSL/TLS
protocol itself, whether implemented in Web browsers, Web servers or
<span   class="emphasis"><em>anything else</em></span> using SSL/TLS. Accordingly, application or
platform-specific patches couldn't help. The SSL/TLS specifications
themselves, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>all implementations of it</em></span> (mainly in the form of
libraries such as OpenSSL), had to be changed.
</p><p>
That's the bad news. OpenVPN depends on protocols that have been under
intense fire lately. The good news is, because e-commerce, on-line
banking and scores of other critical Internet applications do as well, at
the time of this
writing, the IETF has responded very rapidly to make the necessary revisions
to the SSL/TLS protocol specifications, and major vendors and other SSL/TLS
implementers appear to be poised to update their SSL/TLS libraries
accordingly. Hopefully, by the time you read this, that particular issue
will have been resolved.
</p><p>
Obviously, by even publishing this article, I'm betting on the continued
viability of SSL/TLS and, therefore, of OpenVPN. But, I'd be out of character
if I didn't speak frankly of these problems! You can find links to more
information on these SSL/TLS issues in the Resources section.

Getting OpenVPN</h2></div></div><p>
OpenVPN is already a standard part of many Linux distributions. Ubuntu,
Debian, SUSE and Fedora, for example, each has its own
&ldquo;openvpn&rdquo; package.
To install OpenVPN on your distribution of choice, chances are all
you'll need to do is run your distribution's package manager.
</p><p>
If your distribution lacks its own OpenVPN package, however, you can
download the latest source code package from <a href="http://www.openvpn.net" target="_self">www.openvpn.net</a>. This package
includes instructions for compiling and installing OpenVPN from source
code.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18a8580.0x1998ce8"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you've got some idea of the uses of VPN, different protocols that
can be used to build VPN tunnels, different Linux tools available in this
space and some of the merits of OpenVPN, we're ready to roll up our
sleeves and get OpenVPN running in both server and client configurations,
in either &ldquo;bridging&rdquo; or &ldquo;routing&rdquo; mode. 
</p><p>
But, that will have to wait until next month&mdash;I'm out of space for now.
I hope I've whetted your appetite. Until next time, be safe!
