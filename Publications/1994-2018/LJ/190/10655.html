Those Crazy Engineers
</h4><p>
I really enjoyed Joey Bernard's &ldquo;People, Research,
Excellence&rdquo; in the Upfront section of the November 2009 issue about using Linux tools for
processing scientific/engineering data. Being an engineer, I can confirm
that we do indeed use these kinds of data-processing tricks. We often
string them together in pipelines. 
</p><p>
We used to have a friendly competition to see who could string together
the longest pipeline. Double pipelines were common, and soon triple
pipelines became common too. We even had the occasional &ldquo;quadruple
piper&rdquo;
show up. 
</p><p>
However, we finally bestowed the coveted &ldquo;Hooka Award&rdquo; to a five pipeline
string. I do not remember the exact sequence, but it involved grep, sort,
cut paste, awk and xgraph. It may have been done with fewer pipes in awk,
but it met the committee's criteria of unique, useful and nonredundant
functions for each pipe.

Goggle Hacks?
</h4><p>
Thanks to Kyle Rankin for reviewing the Vuzix VR920 goggles in the December
2009 issue. This set of video
goggles looks to be nice for video gaming, but depending on how someone
can feed the two screens, it may be better suited for those who put on
mascots. If Vuzix makes a version that takes DVI input and works with the
BeagleBoard, what's to stop someone from integrating two Webcams into
a head of a mascot? This will work nicely with hobbyists as well as the
special-effects industry. Jim Henson could be proud!
Thanks for the great article.

Calculating Distance
</h4><p>
Coincidently, Dave Taylor's columns on calculating latitude and longitude
in the November and December 2009 issues were
published at the same time I was writing some code (though not a shell
script) to do the same thing for a client. The only problem I can see in
Dave's solution is the conversion from kms to miles. One mile is equal
to
0.621371 kms. Dave's answer to the distance between Long Beach,
CA,
and Boston, MA, is pretty close. Calculating the distance between Boston's Logan
airport and Long Beach's Daugherty Field, I calculate 2594.8 miles. A
flight-planning program I use puts the distance at 2594.5 miles. I
would
chalk Dave's difference up to the Yahoo Maps route, which will not be a
straight line.

Microsoft Trolls?
</h4><p>
I too think <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> is getting letters from
Microsoft Trolls [see the &ldquo;Linux on the Desktop, Continued&rdquo;
letter in the December 2009 issue]. For
example, the author of the &ldquo;Dark Days?&rdquo; letter in December 2009 issue claims he bought
a small laptop running Linux. He didn't specify what laptop or what
distribution. (There's a clue.) He claims it was incompatible with 3
mobile broadbands. He claims he had no success loading Java. He claims he
had no luck loading a (USB?) 56k modem for emergency use. What a crock of
cranberries.
</p><p>
A little over a year ago, I bought an ASUS 901 Eee PC from Target. Out
of the box, I had no trouble connecting one of three unsecured Wi-Fis in my
multi-unit condo. I didn't try the other two. Later on, I was able to
connect to the Wi-Fi at a local public library with no problem. Still
later, I was able to connect to my son's encrypted Wi-Fi (that did take a
few minutes of fiddling).
</p><p>
I have a hard-wired network. It was no problem to incorporate the 901 into
it. Just bring up a terminal screen on it (pressing Ctrl-Alt-t does that) and tweak
a couple configuration files. Oh, did I mention I can print documents
from the 901 to the printer attached to my primary PC?
</p><p>
The 901 came with Java on it. It's version 1.5. I installed 1.6.0_7 so I
could run Moneydance on it. I had to tweak Moneydance's startup bash
script so it would find where I installed it. Moneydance runs just fine.
I installed MySQL on it so I could run my automobile fuel purchases and
maintenance log software on it.
</p><p>
I had to install emeditor so I could invoke the software I installed from
the GUI.
It's running the Linux distro it came with. It does what I need it to do
without changing the OS, so I didn't bother. It worked fine right out of
the box for all the ordinary
things&mdash;connecting to a Wi-Fi access point, doing e-mail, accessing
the Web, writing, viewing pictures, watching YouTube videos and so on. True, I had to know
something about using a computer before I could customize it, but so what?
That's true for any of them.
</p><p>
One last thought. You know how to cripple a computer? Get rid of the
command-line interface.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Dan Curtis  <br><br>
</p><p>
Although I'm not convinced the letters are from Microsofty folks, I admit
it's often a bit odd to hear the problems people claim to have with their laptops.
But then again, I got an Acer Aspire One 751h and had boatloads of
problems. If the person is truly a new user, it's unlikely he or she knows
what to specify when asking for help&mdash;&ldquo;Uh, it's blue, does that
help?&rdquo;
So it's very likely people are having legitimate concerns. The truth of
the matter is that I'm unlikely to get flustered with scathing letters
to the editor complaining about Linux's shortfalls. Our community is
one that should strive to be open and helpful when people are looking
for help and lend a sympathetic ear when people just want to vent. Why?
Because if our goal is to help people understand the value of open source,
we need to <span   class="emphasis"><em>be</em></span> that value.
</p><p>
So if they are trolls, I say bring 'em on. Some of the best Linux
advocates were Windows users at one time!&mdash;Ed.

SheevaPlug Please
</h4><p>
Hello, your magazine mentioned the SheevaPlug briefly
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10440" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/10440</a>), but I think that this
interesting little device might be a good target for review.
I've been thinking of getting one, as I'd love to have a Web server at
home, but I don't want to have yet <span   class="emphasis"><em>another</em></span> machine sucking up power (not
to mention, leaving it on all the time, avoiding distro hopping and so on, just
to make sure that my server doesn't suffer from downtime). The SheevaPlug
seems to be a full ARM-based (and tremendously low-power!) computer the
size of an AC adapter, perfect for SSH and setting up whatever server a
user would desire. I have found some reviews on-line, but none from sources
that I trust as much as <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>.
Anyway, here's to hoping that one of your writers takes it for a spin
sometime!

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Tuxly_Tuxford_McTuxtington   <br><br>
</p><p>
I agree. In my house, the &ldquo;server room&rdquo; is our closet, and
with a full-blown computer running in there, it gets hot! Not only are we interested
in the SheevaPlug, but we also have an article lined up. Stay tuned for
our take soon. (I'm actually waiting for the article to decide if
<span   class="emphasis"><em>I</em></span>
want to get one too!)&mdash;Ed.

Thanks Microsoft!
</h4><p>
Like many geeks, people often ask me to fix their computers. Thanks
to Vista and Windows 7, this has been happening a lot more often. I make a good bit
of money, and I often convince them to install an &ldquo;extra operating
system&rdquo;
for free. I tell them, &ldquo;if worse comes to worse, and Windows fails again,
you always can use Ubuntu as a backup operating system so you still
can get on-line or whatever. But, it is a very good OS and you should check it
out.&rdquo;
</p><p>
So, I customize it for them (people can be very militant about docks
or where a taskbar is). I also resolve possible wireless problems or
blacklist modules that could cause hardware problems, and usually I like to
put a little text document on their desktop as a quick walk-through.
</p><p>
So far, I have had only one person actually prefer Vista, in which case I
removed Ubuntu for him. Everyone else has given me enormously positive
feedback, and many have asked me to remove Windows altogether. A lot of
the time, they even pay me a little extra. So, I would like to thank
Microsoft for all the extra business and money it has been throwing my
way.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Zachay Bittner  <br><br>
</p><p>
Awesome. Might I add, installing things like Dropbox (<a href="http://dropbox.com" target="_self">dropbox.com</a>)
and Xmarks (<a href="http://xmarks.com" target="_self">xmarks.com</a>) can make such transitions much less
painful. If people have access to their documents and bookmarks, it makes
using other computers pretty painless.
Also, be sure to install lots of fun games in Linux. Even
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Solitaire</em></span> gets
old after a while, and they might reboot just to play
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Frozen Bubble</em></span>!&mdash;Ed.

Work the Shell and C
</h4><p>
Without looking it up for confirmation, it appears that your distance
program [see Dave Taylor's &ldquo;Calculating the Distance between Two
Latitude/Longitude Points&rdquo; in the December 2009 issue] is calculating doubles from input args parsed as floats (via
atof).
It's just a guess, but that would probably introduce those darn rounding
errors.

Frank Brown  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span> That's a good possibility. I'll dig into that one and

Desktop Linux? Not Yet
</h4><p>
I have been a fan of Linux from its beginning and have followed the debate
of whether it is ready for the general desktop as a main competitor to
Windows. However, time and again I have been disappointed. My last
confrontation was with Ubuntu, which I installed on my Dell Inspiron
530s. The wireless card has the Broadcom chipset (4328 rev 3), and it turns
out this is not supported by any Linux distribution (out of the box). You
can go through some contortions and install the drivers yourself, and I was
able to do it for Ubuntu 9.04 but not for 9.10. Now, Dell is the first or
second biggest computer maker, and Broadcom is also a major wireless chip
supplier, so how come they are not supported by Linux (and this problem has
been known for at least 2&ndash;3 years)? Even if Broadcom does not release its
driver source code, why wouldn't the Linux distributors provide a simple
script to install the right driver? This and similar problems prevent Linux
from being a real competitor to Windows on the desktop.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Eli Sternheim  <br><br>
</p><p>
Sigh. Up until Windows 7, installing drivers (that strange contortion)
on Windows was much more common than the need on Linux. Even companies
that don't provide source code aren't the problem&mdash;it's not providing
<span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> driver support for Linux. Take NVIDIA, for example. There is no
source code for its drivers, but it supports the Linux community by
providing close-sourced binary drivers for its hardware.
</p><p>
The other side of the coin is that hardware changes so often, a
revision 3 vs. a revision 2 could be drastic. Shouldn't it be up to
Dell to provide the drivers? If you want a driver for the Dell for
Windows, you go to Dell's support site. Shouldn't Dell do the same for
Linux? When it's all said and done, the Linux community is doing a fairly
remarkable job supplying workarounds for strange hardware. Hopefully,
support will continue to get better, even if vendors
<span   class="emphasis"><em>don't</em></span> actively
help!&mdash;Ed.

Dave Taylor's Problems with Distance
</h4><p>
I think the distances computed by Dave's distance.c program are okay [see
Dave's Work the Shell in the December 2009 issue]. I
started to check the formulas carefully and then had an idea:
Wolfram|Alpha (<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com" target="_self">www.wolframalpha.com</a>). Entering
&ldquo;denver, co to chicago, il&rdquo;,
I got 916.7 miles&mdash;quite close to Dave's 917.984. Then, &ldquo;long beach, ca to
boston, ma&rdquo; yielded 2,599 miles&mdash;pretty darn close to Dave's 2,597.53 miles.
I would say his computations are okay.
</p><p>
So, why do the computations yield 2,599, when Yahoo Maps says it's 3,015, a
good 400 miles longer? If you display the route chosen by Yahoo, it
definitely does not look like a straight line. But the computed distance
is along a great circle, not a straight line, and if you draw a great
circle between the BOS and LGB airports using GPS Visualizer
(<a href="http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/calculators" target="_self">www.gpsvisualizer.com/calculators</a>), it is surprisingly close to the road
route shown by Yahoo. (By the way, GPS Visualizer says the distance is
2,598.4 miles, so I think you can quit worrying about your distance
computations.)
</p><p>
It may be that there is a fractal effect here: when the route is viewed
from afar, it looks like a fairly smooth curve. However, if each short
segment is examined, there probably is a lot of zigzag. (But 400 miles of
zigzag?)

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Roger House  <br><br>

<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span>
Roger, I like your answer. We'll tally it up to a lot of sidetracks and
inefficient roads.

A Penguin with Good Eyesight
</h4><p>
I was in a reflective mood today and thought I should share some of my
thoughts to encourage those of you cutting your teeth with Linux. Five
years ago, I knew absolutely nothing about this glorious operating system,
and I am within a month's time going to be starting up the first LUG in our
community with 20 terminals available, so we can start collectively raising
up new &ldquo;Penguins&rdquo; throughout our city. If you are discouraged with not
knowing what in the world the terminal is, or if you think that
&ldquo;apt-get&rdquo;
is computer lingo for a &ldquo;hiccup&rdquo; or &ldquo;yum&rdquo; is an
edible OS, you are not
alone.
</p><p>
What I have found to be an invaluable resource is this magazine. At first,
I thought I was reading some kind of hieroglyphic, but eventually, I caught
on to one thing and then another. My wife thinks I am celebrating Christmas
when my trip to the mailbox renders the next month's copy of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>. I can't
wait to read every page from front to back, even if I don't understand
about 50% of it!
</p><p>
Bill Hybels, an American author, once said, &ldquo;Visionary people face the
same problems everyone else faces; but rather than get paralyzed by their
problems, visionaries immediately commit themselves to finding a
solution.&rdquo; This is how I view Linux and the Linux community. My goal is
to one day see my community hosting a Linux conference. It may not be of
the same scale as many advertised within <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, however, Linux has inspired me
to go from a computer user paralyzed with problems to a &ldquo;Penguin with good
eyesight&rdquo;.
</p><p>
If you are a new user, hang in there. Be a good researcher. Learn to
dual-boot. The pain of learning this OS pays off in no time. I spent 30
hours trying to work with my former OS and could not fix the problems I was
having. I dedicated 30 hours to learning my new OS, and it was time spent
wisely.
</p><p>
Much thanks to all who have contributed to this magazine and my growth as
a Penguin. May we all improve our Vision!

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Dean Anderson  <br><br>
</p><p>
Aw, shucks Dean, you're making us blush! Regarding a community Linux
event, to be completely honest, they're usually at
<span   class="emphasis"><em>least</em></span> as helpful as the
big ones. My suggestion would be to start small. Perhaps invite a couple
school techs to your LUG meetings and so on. I'm a big fan of Linux in
education, so my suggestion may be biased, but if you can get kids using
Linux in school, total world domination is the next logical step!&mdash;Ed.

Sick of Windows Ads
</h4><p>
I think every day I see an ad on the TV for Windows. It first started with
Vista, then I really started to take notice. Now we have those lame
&ldquo;Windows,
you find it you keep it&rdquo; and Windows 7 ads. I have seen Linux ads
only from
IBM. Why are there no TV ads for Linux? I don't hate Windows, but I love Linux. By the
way I also love your magazine. I have been getting it since 1998/1999. 

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
John M.  <br><br>
</p><p>
Sadly, the big reason is money. Television ads are
<span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> expensive. I
think the only hope would be for hardware vendors to bank some money on a
Linux ad campaign to sell laptops and so forth. Until then, we'll likely remain
grass-roots, especially on the desktop.&mdash;Ed.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake 3 </em></span>at 1080p on an MSI Wind U115 with Moblin

We did some videos during the Mobile Developer camp in Munich, and there
was a developer from the Linux Foundation, showing us what you can get out of
the Poulsbo chipset with some decent drivers. This is running on Moblin
2.0,
and it gets some 30&ndash;40fps!
Check out the video here:

</p><p>
Keep in mind, this might be the GPU for the upcoming Moorestown
platform (I am 95% sure), so we will see such GPU-power in handhelds and
smartphones! 

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Sascha   <br><br>
</p><p>
It's funny, I saw that video the day after my big rant on the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>
Web site about the Poulsbo chipset. I really hope it leads to something
viable on those Netbooks with the GMA500, but I'm still not holding my
breath. Thanks for sending in the link. It's a little
encouraging!&mdash;Ed.

Here are a couple shots of me doing some tower work on a pair of
long-distance 802.11 Wi-Fi links. The equipment being installed is a pair of
Ubiquiti Bullet2-HP radios, which are Linux-based. They are actually
replacing
a pair of Cisco radios that were found to be incredibly fragile.
One of the wireless links provides service to a fireworks company (Premier
Pyrotechnics) located about 11 miles from the city of Richland, Missouri. The
other
is to provide service to the company president, both of which are located
in areas where any sort of broadband is completely unavailable other
than satellite service.
You can see, my Open Source backpack and Ubuntu backpacks came in handy
