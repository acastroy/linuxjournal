How to make the perfect desktop for young kids.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29a3580.0x2a9b300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The theme for this month's issue is the desktop, and when I sat down to write
this article, I was going to focus on bringing the cloud to your desktop.
A number of services exist, and I figured one of them would help
me solve a problem that has gotten more troublesome of late&mdash;keeping
all my workstations in sync. But, in the process of doing my research, a more
pressing desktop problem came up. His name is Max. 
</p><p>
Max is my son. He is only 15 months old, but he already has become a
technology-seeking missile. No remote is safe. Any keyboard or mouse
within reach is explored. This probably is a combination of
mimicry, since I spend a lot of time with a mouse or remote in my hand,
and his excitement over cause and effect. As the IT person in the house, I
would prefer it that my users not bang on the keyboards until something bad
happens. As a parent and Linux fan, I am happy for him to explore
technology in whatever way he chooses&mdash;especially because I am in the golden
time before I have to worry about what he is searching for on Google.
</p><p>
What started as a &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; idea came together pretty quickly. A
quick scan of the inventory in my office turned up an old file server that was
no longer being used. It is not very powerful, but Max did not need more
than a &ldquo;computer&rdquo;. I found a CD-ROM drive and installed it. The
computer already had a network card (yes, it is so old, there was no onboard
NIC) and integrated sound. I pulled out an old 17" monitor and some
speakers. That just left a mouse, keyboard and desk. 
</p><p>
My wife already had gotten Max a keyboard. It was supposed to be for
Christmas, but in the name of turning in my article in time, I opened it a
few months early. It is a Crayola keyboard. The keys are big and brightly
colored. It has no function keys (which means Max cannot get to the
terminals). For a mouse, I picked up a Colby T-Rex mouse,
which claims
to be specially designed for the way little kids click. Originally, I was a
little worried Max constantly would pick up the mouse to stare at the
red light, but that did not seem to interest him.

</p></div></div><p>
The last piece of the puzzle was the desk. I measured Max and found that
he needed a desk at about 22" tall if he was standing when he used the
computer. I use a standing desk from GeekDesk. So, it seemed to
make sense to have him stand as well&mdash;both because it is better for
you and also because it means I won't be tripping over a tiny chair in my
office. A quick trip to Wal-Mart turned up a computer stand. It was built
out of particle wood and plastic tubes&mdash;not the best piece of furniture in
the world, but I was able to find a combination of plastic tubes that gave
it exactly the right height. As a bonus, I have tubes left over, so we can
raise the desk as he grows.
</p><p>
Now that his workstation was assembled, it was time to get to the
installing portion of the show. After some quick research on Google, I
turned up three possibilities for his OS.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29a3580.0x2a9b930"></a>
Sugar Learning Platform</h2></div></div><p>
The Sugar Learning Platform was the system originally
developed for the One Laptop per Child Netbook. I was interested in this
one because it is specifically designed for learning. The developers spent a lot of
time rethinking how everything works so that it would reinforce that goal.
Besides, like most people, I had seen only screenshots. It seemed like this
was my best opportunity to use it for an actual purpose. Sugar is now
based on Fedora as its base OS. You even can download a version to
run off a USB thumbdrive. I downloaded and installed the Strawberry
release onto a thumbdrive.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29a3580.0x2a9ba38"></a>
Edubuntu</h2></div></div><p>
Edubuntu is a branch of Ubuntu. This version is
focused on building an &ldquo;educational&rdquo; operating system, and it
seems to have 
two different goals. The first is to group software in
age-appropriate bundles. The second is to make it easy to administer
computer labs
running Ubuntu. I was more interested in the bundles than the
administration. Originally, Edubuntu provided a full ISO for you to download
and install. Recently, it offers another option. You simply can add on
Edubuntu bundles to an existing Ubuntu install, which meant I could just
use one of the Ubuntu CDs I already had lying around.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29a3580.0x2a9bb98"></a>
Qimo</h2></div></div><p>
Qimo (as in esQIMO) is a kid-specific distribution, also based on Ubuntu.
It seemed to be more focused on the desktop portion than Edubuntu. For
example, during the install process, you create a user account. That user
is given full administration rights (aka access to sudo). Another user,
qimo, 
also is created. qimo does not have a password and does not have
sudo&mdash;meaning that when you boot up the machine, the user account
the child is using can run applications but cannot make any modifications
to the system. Qimo uses the Xfce desktop environment, so it should
be less resource-hungry (which is important as I am putting it on
old equipment). Qimo also has a very cute
kid-style Eskimo theme.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29a3580.0x2a9bcf8"></a>
Installation Day</h2></div></div><p>
I already had the Sugar thumbdrive, so I moved on to getting the other two
installed. My goal was to have a run-off. I would install all three and
play with them. Once I got comfortable, I would unleash Max on each and
see which one was the winner.
</p><p>
I installed Jaunty (9.04) onto the computer. I also partitioned the drive
into three different parts. That way, I could install each OS on its own
partition. Once the install was complete, Ubuntu reminded me that Karmic
(9.10) had been released. I decided to upgrade to Karmic, as the
Edubuntu site said it supported it. After a long wait, everything was
installed. Then, I added on the Edubuntu package:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-edu-preschool
</pre>
</p><p>
It installed without any problems. The only issue was it did not
change anything about the look and feel of the system. Max does well, but
I think it will be a little while before I have him navigate to
different menus to find Tux Paint.
</p><p>
Undeterred, I went through the install process for Qimo. Again, things
were very straightforward, but I made two mistakes in this portion. I did
not install a bootloader. I figured I'd let the GRUB2 installed in Karmic
handle the booting. (It turns out I should have installed it just to have easy
GRUB menu files to crib from.) Second, I filled out the information about
an account on the system. I clicked Auto login, because I assumed
it was silly to make Max log in. That turned out to be a mistake. Because
the system was set to log in as me, it would not log in as the qimo user. 
</p><p>
Now I had all three ready for testing. As they say in the UK, things went
pear-shaped. I have only two USB ports on the workstation, and they are used
up by the keyboard and mouse. That left me nowhere to plug in the Sugar
thumbdrive. I booted up Karmic, and in the process of trying to add Qimo
as a boot option, I went down the path of upgrading to GRUB2. In the
process, I blew up my ability to boot anything.
</p><p>
That basically
wasted an entire afternoon. This was all meant to be a project to introduce
my son to the wonderful world of Linux&mdash;not an exercise in hair pulling.
I took a step back and looked at the Sugar Web site to see if there was
another way to run it. Then, everything clicked into place. Sure, these
are different &ldquo;products&rdquo;, but they still are open-source software.
Everything I was working on was a package at some point. So, rather than
thinking of it as &ldquo;here are three choices, pick one&rdquo;, I decided to
install Qimo as the base, and then put Edubuntu and Sugar on top. That
meant I could play with all of it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29a3580.0x2a9c118"></a>
Installation, Take Two</h2></div></div><p>
I installed Qimo again. This time, I had it take over the entire drive. I
also left the Auto login box unchecked. As I started poking
around, I found that Qimo actually is based on Intrepid (8.10). I
decided to use the onboard Ubuntu tools to upgrade it to Jaunty, so that it
would be easier to bring in Edubuntu and Sugar, which was a
very straightforward process. The only issue I ran into was with the
custom GDM configuration file. I ended up hand-merging the original
version from Qimo with the new one.
</p><p>
Once it was up and running, I added the Edubuntu package. Because it is
available as a single package, it didn't take very long. So, that just left
Sugar.
</p><p>
There are some known issues with Sugar and Jaunty. The Sugar Wiki pointed
me to a PPA (personal package archive). I added
https://launchpad.net/~alsroot/+archive/ppa to my sources.list. Then, I
authorized the archive by adding its signing key:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 
 &#8618;--recv-keys F265806A9BFFF0F4
</pre>
</p><p>
I had to remove a package that caused a conflict and then was able to
install Sugar:

<pre     class="programlisting">
apt-get remove etoys-doc
apt-get install sugar-platform
</pre>
</p><p>
To run Sugar, you run sugar-emulator. I played with it briefly. There were
two problems. One, the version I installed seemed to need other things
installed to get it to do anything. The second issue was even bigger than
the first. The Sugar environment expects to be the desktop. That means it
would like to take over the mouse and the display. It seems like it has
potential, but it adds too much complexity for what I was trying to do for
Max.
</p><p>
Next up, I added an MP3 player (Max loves to play music) and the
Flash plugin. It turns out every kid Web site I could find requires Flash to
see or do anything. I added links to his favorite Web sites to the
desktop. I modified the display a little. I doubled the size of the mouse
cursor and expanded the space between launchers on the main panel. Just to
make things a little more solid, I zip-tied the mouse and keyboard so they
can move, but not be removed. I contemplated setting up an auto off/on
using Wake on LAN, but decided Max needs some more time before he can
use his workstation unsupervised.
</p><p>
Once all that was done, I turned it over to Max. He played with Tux Paint
for a little while. I turned on Proton Radio in the background for him,
which he really likes. After a short time of moving the mouse, he anchored
himself to the keyboard. Much like his father, he seems to prefer the
keyboard as his input device of choice.

Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>
There is a lot of software out there for kids&mdash;serious typing
tutors, counting and shapes helpers, and even a Mr Potato Head simulator
(KTuberling). The craziest thing I saw was eToys, which is a Smalltalk
environment for teaching
kids programming. It is way beyond what I learned in Logo as a kid. 
</p><p>
Max's first &ldquo;computer&rdquo; was my Chumby. He spent a lot of time
looking at LOLcats on there. Plus, because the Chumby has a built-in slideshow
for all of the content, Max constantly would get new stuff, even if he was
just looking at the Chumby. That kind of interface really works well with
Max's level of attention span. I was unable to find an application to
duplicate that experience for Max. Spending some time searching, I have
found some Flash-based games that come close. I will keep introducing new
things to Max and see what sticks.
</p><p>
This actually brings me to my primary lesson from all of this. When I
started, I was not sure if Max was ready for a computer. To be honest,
there was not a clear consensus among my friends as to when that would be.
Having played with Max and his computer for a week now, I can say this: Max
is ready to explore anything as long as it is on his terms. That is the
real value of this desktop. Now I have a place to show Max new things. I
can let him try out new software or Web sites, and he can do it at his
pace,
because it is his computer. Before, as soon as playtime was done, I
switched my computer back to work mode. Now Max wanders into my office
does a little paint or controls the volume on some music. I look forward
to the day when he asks for help debugging his eToys programs. I am not
sure when that will be, but I am pretty sure it will come a little sooner
with this project.
