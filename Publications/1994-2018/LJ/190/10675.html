Gene Sally's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pro Linux Embedded Systems</em></span> (Apress)</h2></div></div><p>
Gene Sally's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pro Linux Embedded Systems</em></span> (Apress) goes beyond
just porting embedded Linux to new hardware to cover tuning Linux and
leveraging open-source code to build more robust, feature-rich embedded
applications. The guide is a resource for employing technologies and
techniques typically reserved for desktop systems. Readers will learn
the anatomy of an embedded Linux project as well as how to create an
embedded Linux development environment, configure and build an embedded
Linux kernel, configure and build open-source projects for embedded
systems and minimize resources and boot times. In addition, the book
explores open-source resources available to improve development.

RunRev Ltd.'s Revolution</h2></div></div><p>
RunRev Ltd. has boosted the feature set of its new Revolution 4.0 for
application and Web development, available for the first time in a free
version. RunRev says that Revolution offers &ldquo;dramatic time and resource
savings over traditional tools such as Flash, Silverlight, Java and
C++&rdquo;.
The new version 4.0 also offers direct deployment to the Web without
recoding or writing a line of HTML. Revolution is a modern descendant of
natural-language technologies, such as Apple's HyperCard, which enables
software construction to nonprogrammers. Revolution 4.0 has three
editions for different skill levels: the free revMedia, the enhanced
revStudio and the revEnterprise for mission-critical applications.

Coyote Point's Equalizer GX Series</h2></div></div><p>
Coyote Point has bulked up the feature set of its EQ/OS Version 8.6,
the latest iteration of the traffic management operating system that
drives its Equalizer GX series product line. The series ranges from the
entry-level E250GX load balancer to the enterprise-class E650GX all-in-one
application delivery appliance. Core enhancements include 802.1Q VLAN
support, which can double aggregate network throughput (up to 2.6 Gbps
for the E650GX); overhaul of the failover subsystem; cluster-cloning
capability; an expanded toolset for intelligent load balancing of VMware
Infrastructure and a new energy-efficiency capability to 
power servers on and off automatically.

Comtrol's RocketLinx ES7506 Switch</h2></div></div><p>
Comtrol Corporation says its new RocketLinx ES7506 industrial
managed PoE plus switch &ldquo;changes the game when it comes to where you
place your devices&rdquo;. Designed for applications such as IP surveillance,
security and transportation, where power sources are not conveniently
located, the RocketLinx ES7506 offers four Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) ports
delivering up to 30 watts and supporting the new IEEE802.3at standard.
&ldquo;When setting up an IP camera or wireless access point, for
instance&rdquo;,
says Comtrol, &ldquo;you can choose the optimum location for the application,
versus mounting the device closest to an available power source&rdquo;. Tasks
such as configuring ports, rebooting a failed device or implementing green
power scheduling can be controlled via SNMP, Web interface or the included
RocketLinx NetVision management software. Additionally, the switch
features two uplink ports that support redundant ring network topologies,
which enable network failure recovery at less than five milliseconds.
