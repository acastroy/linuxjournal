    If you need to run MS Windows applications under Linux
    and haven't been satisfied with the current solutions, here's
    the road less traveled...
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12fd580.0x13f5298"></a></h2></div></div><p>There are three methods of obtaining use
of Microsoft (MS) Windows applications under Linux. They are:
</p><p>Wine, available from
ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/ALPHA/Wine/development/DOSEMU,
available from
ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/ALPHA/dosemu/DESQview/X (DV/X),
available from QuarterDeck software</p><p>Wine is rather well-known, as is the excellent DOSEMU. While
researching these methods, however, I discovered that there exists
a wide misunderstanding of their current capabilities and status
among Usenet readers. I certainly support the efforts of the Wine
and DOSEMU crews to bring MS Windows applications to Linux, but the
impression that either is &ldquo;ready for prime time&rdquo; only impedes
their efforts. Annoyed users complain that the products are, as
their developers themselves point out, very incomplete.</p><p>For instance, the file dosemu-0.60.2/dos/README.Windows
contains this warning under the heading
<span   class="bold"><b>Windows 3.1 Protected Mode</b></span>:
WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! Danger Will
Robinson!!! This is not yet fully supported and there are many
known bugs! Large programs will almost certainly NOT WORK!!! BE
PREPARED FOR SYSTEM CRASHES IF YOU TRY THIS!!!</p><p>The document goes on to list some of the problems; in short,
it's not yet ready for serious use, such as most work environments.
Take a moment to read that README completely before experimenting.
I found it to be accurate.</p><p>Wine has a similar status: the release notes proclaim that
Wine is currently for developers only, and you should not yet
expect your applications to work. Thus, a Linux user is left with
two choices: reboot the system with DOS or use the slower DV/X.
Linux users isolated from a network tend to think that rebooting
with DOS is Okay, but those needing network services or the power
of Linux on a regular basis should consider using DV/X.</p><p>DV/X is probably unknown to most <i  >LJ</i>
readers, and the thrust of this article is to introduce you to it.
The three possibilities above are listed in order of speed&mdash;Wine
will certainly be the fastest when it'ss finished. They are listed
in reverse order of &ldquo;success&rdquo;&mdash;DV/X is capable of running nearly
every large MS Windows application now. Because I am willing to pay
a speed penalty in exchange for access to other Linux services
while running MS Word or MS Excel, I have been happily utilizing
DV/X for months. I look forward to the day that Wine (or DOSEMU)
allows me to run MS Word without the speed penalty.</p><p>DV/X is QuarterDeck's solution to bringing DOS to network
computing (see ftp.qdeck.com:/pub or
<a href="http://www.qdeck.com" target="_self">www.qdeck.com</a>).
QuarterDecki's DOS software line includes the well-known QEMM
memory manager and DESQview, the best DOS multi-tasker. DESQview
was expanded into a network program several years ago as
DESQview/X. This software product brought Unix programs to DOS via
an X Window interface and provided DOS programs to networked Unix
hosts with X. One of the most interesting features of DV/X is its
ability to provide MS Windows applications to networked X boxes.
The software had some delays coming to market, probably due to the
difficulty of creating a program to translate MS Windows and X. It
is now available as version 2.0 and is much improved.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12fd580.0x13f5710"></a>Setup</h2></div></div><p>To run MS Windows applications such as Word 6.0, Excel 5.0,
and PowerPoint with DV/X, you need a dedicated DOS computer in
addition to your Linux box. I used an old system, a 386DX with 12
Megabytes of RAM, at home and a spare 486DX2 machine at work. A
network connection is necessary; I had pairs of SMC Ultra and 3COM
3C503 Ethernet cards. The DOS system doesn't need a fast or
powerful video card, as the X display on the Linux box will be
where you control MS Windows. The DOS box needs at least 8 MB of
RAM, since DV/X can easily use up 5 MB and MS Windows needs several
more. QuarterDeck supplies networking software with DV/X as part of
its base cost, but it'ss not TCP/IP-based. A Novell TCP/IP stack is
available for an extra fee and has been offered several times at no
cost as a purchase inducement.</p><p>Get your Linux system up with networking active (see the
NET-2 HOWTO document). Install DV/X on the DOS box after installing
the TCP/IP stack (you will need an ODI driver on the DOS side for a
TCP/IP stack). Just follow the prompts (and DV/X manuals) and
adjust per your network. On an isolated network, you may wish to
allow access without passwords for easier use. Once Linux has
networking running and DV/X is installed, run some ping checks to
be sure that communications are working correctly. I get 1 to 2
millisecond ping times on either a dedicated two computer network
or a crowded 10-BaseT hub. Try some large FTP transfers to
accurately test the network; isolated networks should run hundreds
of kilobytes per second when properly configured.</p><p>Once you think your &ldquo;network computer&rdquo; is ready, launch
DV/X on the DOS box and bring up an Xterm on the Linux side. You
will need a username besides root on the Linux side in order to
simplify logins. Any username can have root's &ldquo;power&rdquo; by setting
the UID and GID to 0&mdash;something that might be convenient for
overriding protections during file transfers. Obviously, don't
consider doing this if your network is connected in any way to the
outside world. Also, if you do this, you are discarding all the
file system and memory protections that protect you from damage
caused by program bugs, viruses (none are documented to exist under
Linux), and simple mistakes.</p><p>In the Linux Xterm, type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ xhost +dosboxname
$ rsh dosboxname fileman
</pre><p>where <b  >dosboxname</b> is the alias for the IP
address for the DV/X DOS computer (you will need to have it in
/etc/hosts on the Linux computer). After a few moments, you should
get a new X-Window with the very useful DV/X File Manager. It's
similar to the old Norton Commander, an interface whose look and
feel has been duplicated countless times. With the DV/X File
Manager, you can log into networked hosts, initiate multiple file
transfers, or perform routine disk housekeeping tasks. If the File
Manager doesn't work, take a look at whatever messages were
displayed and check manuals, Usenet, friends, support lines, and
maybe even the author...</p><p>Log into the Linux computer from the File Manager (under the
Navigate radio button) as a user other than root. Work through the
file system until you get to one of the directories in the font
path for the X server (I used /usr/X386/lib/X11/fonts/misc). Note
that File Manager doesn't show symbolic links, so you need the
actual pathname. On the DV/X side, maneuver to the BDF subdirectory
under the DVX directory. Copy all the font files over to the Linux
side (unless you <span   class="bold"><b>never</b></span> want to run
DOS remotely) with a binary transfer. Check that the file sizes
come out identical on both sides of the File Manager dialog box.
Once that's complete, you need to run <b  >mkfontdir</b>
in the Linux font directory you chose and restart the X
server.</p><p>Now you can run remote DOS with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ rsh dosboxname dos
</pre><p>You might need to set up the xhost access list again. Without
the transferred fonts, a remote DOS process might crash your X
server. Now that you have these preliminary steps accomplished, you
know that your &ldquo;network computer&rdquo; is working. Time for MS
Windows. DV/X has a lot of interesting features, such as the Remote
Program Launcher; spend some time exploring them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12fd580.0x13f5c38"></a>MS Windows</h2></div></div><p>Initially, you should start with MS Windows configured to use
just a simple VGA Display driver. Getting MS Windows running if you
have difficulties is a problem exclusively for their product
support personnel. Naturally, if MS Windows doesn't run on the DOS
computer, it won't work under DV/X. After getting the networked MS
Windows running, you can get screen sizes of 1024x768 if your X
display has room. Since DV/X is converting the video commands, you
don't need the actual video card drivers. Instead, you use the
Windows &ldquo;Super VGA 1024x768 256 colors Large Fonts&rdquo; driver. Read
the DV/X documentation on setting up WinX for best results. To run
MS Windows under Linux X, you can type the following in an
xterm:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ rsh dosboxname winx
</pre><p>In a few moments, you should be able to launch applications
other than Solitaire from MS Windows. You can even start another MS
Windows process (if you have sufficient memory) that is completely
independent of the first (be careful). You're limited to Standard
mode, but so far I haven't come across an application I need that
truly requires Enhanced mode. One of the first things you'll need
to do is change the MS Windows color scheme with the Control Panel
Color tool (In the &ldquo;Main&rdquo; window). Otherwise, you may have
invisible fonts! I suggest starting with the &ldquo;Arizona&rdquo; color
scheme instead of the default.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12fd580.0x13f5df0"></a>Gotchas</h2></div></div><p>TANSTAAFL: There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch. As
mentioned above, there is a speed penalty for using DV/X to get MS
Windows applications under Linux. It's a direct result of the
network connection between the involved computers (that's likely to
be the slowest part of the pipeline). However, for many uses, that
speed penalty may be negligible. Ten Mbit/s Ethernet is not very
fast when compared to ISA bus speeds: ISA is 5 times faster than
the original Ethernet. There are one hundred Mbit Ethernet cards
appearing, for a cost about 2 times the 10 Mbit cards. One hundred
Mbit cards should give DV/X MS Windows performance equivalent to an
ISA video card, which is quite acceptable to many users. This is
the most serious drawback, but it needs to be balanced against the
alternatives&mdash;in short, your mileage may vary.</p><p>As I mentioned, the speed difference may be negligible&mdash;you
may not even notice it. I still can't type at even one-thousandth
Ethernet speed. I find the major use of DV/X MS Windows to be
typing large amounts of text without text layout or formatting
concerns. The other major use is for tasks of under 30 minutes; in
both cases, the speed penalty is not apparent or traded off against
the time to change operating systems. The remaining gotchas are
somewhat minor.</p><p>The DOS ODI driver may have some problems. I notice that the
16-bit Ultra cards don't outperform the 8-bit 3C503 cards. I
believe the Ultra ODI driver might be the cause. The network stack
you use on the DOS computer can also make a difference&mdash;I've seen
the best results from the Novell TCP stack. It's RTFM time
here.</p><p>You may see some color changes. I use fvwm as an X Window
manager, and sometimes the MS Window picks up the colors of the
fvwm pager when switching between pages. Usually the next dialog
box clears the colors up. There may also be some rearranging of
your X workplace in order to fit MS Windows in at higher
resolutions. The Alt-F4 keystroke will no longer close the MS
Windows application. Instead, under the standard fvwm setup, it
will iconify the window. Double-clicking the corner of the menu bar
still works nicely to terminate applications. The usual problems
between DOS filename limitations and Unix file names exist during
file transfer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12fd580.0x13f6000"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>I use DV/X regularly after months of experimenting&mdash;in fact,
I booted DOS last month and realized it had been 6 weeks since I
had last ran DOS. DV/X is as stable as MS Windows (actually, a
little better, since DESQview isolates tasks in a fashion similar
to Linux). There are some silver linings in the slow speed cloud.
DV/X File Manager is a very useful tool; we have an Apollo
workstation that exercises it frequently. DV/X can provide remote
printing services, making the Linux end a snap to configure. Oh,
and yes, I used my network to assist in preparing this article. See
Figure 1.</p><p>I've set up two networks with DV/X and Linux; most of it runs
&ldquo;right out of the box&rdquo;. I've been using Linux at work for 10
months now and have only rarely been forced back into DOS. In fact,
Linux applications have provided better answers to tasks than the
less stable DOS equivalents on several occasions. Source code
availability and group programming naturally lead to superior
programs!</p></div></div>
