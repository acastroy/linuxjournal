        Been considering installing or re-installing Linux on a PC? Confused by the wide range of distributions available? This article may not solve all your woes, but it should at least put you on the right track.
      </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2156580.0x224e190"></a></h2></div></div><p>Why doesn't <i  >Linux Journal</i> recommend one particular Linux distribution as
the best? Why not do quarterly awards for the best current Linux
distribution? There are at least two good reasons and one
not-so-good reason. The good reasons are that different users have
different needs, and that a &ldquo;best&rdquo; rating for any one
distribution would unfairly penalize the other distributors. The
not-so-good reason has been that <i  >Linux Journal</i>
hasn't had the resources to do comparative review.
</p><p>While we still will not recommend one &ldquo;best&rdquo; distribution,
we have recently acquired hardware specifically for testing
distributions. While we can't begin to buy a full set of hardware
that will allow us to test distributions on a wide range of
hardware, we can assume that since all the distributions use the
Linux kernel with few or no modifications, there are not likely to
be too many differences based on hardware. By buying mainstream
hardware (see <a href="1230s2.html" target="_self">The Test Platform</a>
sidebar), we can ignore the hardware problems that do not generally
differentiate distributions and concentrate on the other
characteristics of the distributions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2156580.0x224e3f8"></a>You Be the Judge</h2></div></div><p>We are not even going to attempt to rank the distributions.
We will introduce the distributions that are the most common in the
U.S. as this is written; we will introduce other distributions in
future articles. As we explore more distributions, we will update
our table for feature comparison, and future articles will include
the entire table for all the distributions tested so far for easy
comparison.</p><p>Our comparisons will be designed to allow you to rank the
distributions based on your own needs, rather than our perceptions
of your needs. To do this, we will provide a description of each
distribution, as well as comparison charts of features so that you
can easily see the trade-offs that various Linux distributors have
made.</p><p>Is this a cop-out? Are we shirking our duty? It has become
clear to us that it would be hard for <i  >Linux Journal</i> to rank the distributions; our staff members
have different personal favorite distributions and defend their
choices rationally&mdash;occasionally even argumentatively. At
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, we use Linux
extensively&mdash;nearly exclusively&mdash;and we still don't agree which
distribution is the best. We have different priorities, skills, and
expectations, and we believe this is true of our readers as
well.</p><p>We have reason to think that our readership is thoughtful and
intelligent, and we have certainly been informed in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>many</em></span> letters to the editor that our readers
appreciate being given a chance to form their own opinions. So
instead of attempting to make up your mind for you, we would like
to give you as much material as possible to use to make up your own
mind.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2156580.0x224e710"></a>Version numbers</h2></div></div><p>Many new Linux users confuse the version of the distribution
they are using with the version number of the kernel they are
running. As described in the <a href="1230s1.html" target="_self">What's a
distribution?</a> sidebar, the Linux kernel is just one of the
many pieces of software needed to create an entire distribution.
Each distribution uses version numbers of its own to keep track of
the state of the entire distribution, which has more to do with the
collection of programs than with the particular kernel involved.
Indeed, many distributions have included two or more different
kernel versions in one version of the distribution.</p><p>However, it's worth understanding the version numbers used
for the Linux kernel itself, since the kernel is a key part of any
Linux distribution. Kernel version numbers come in three parts: the
major version number, the minor version number, and the
patch-level. The Linux kernel is being constantly developed by a
large team of developers, and while they add new features, they
occasionally introduce new bugs. To keep this from causing a
problem for Linux users, the developers periodically dedicate
several months to fixing bugs and creating a very robust, stable
kernel. When this is done, a stable version is released with an
even-numbered minor version number. The developers then begin
adding features (and temporarily breaking things sometimes) in
development versions with odd-numbered minor version
numbers.</p><p>Unless you want to live on the &ldquo;bleeding edge&rdquo; of Linux
development, you will probably want to stick with the latest stable
kernel version. As of this writing, the latest stable kernel
version is 1.2.13; by the time you read this, preparations will
probably be underway for 1.4.0.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2156580.0x224e920"></a>Value Added</h2></div></div><p>Several vendors are adding value to existing distributions in
various ways. For example, Caldera is adding commercial components
to Red Hat Commercial Linux to create their Caldera Network
Desktop. WorkGroup Solutions used to enhance Slackware as the base
for WGS Linux; they have now switched to basing their work on Red
Hat Commercial Linux. Trans-Ameritech sells disks with several
distributions, including Slackware and Debian; they base their own
value-added work on Slackware, trying to make it easier to
install.</p><p>Value-add distributions are worth serious consideration, but
they aren't the subject of this review. As part of deciding which
distribution to get, you may want to consider what you can get from
value-add vendors as well as from the base distributions in
question. Most value-add vendors (as well as distribution vendors)
advertise in <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2156580.0x224ead8"></a>Binary File Formats</h2></div></div><p>One of the most common sources of confusion in the Linux
world today involves binary file formats (See
<a href="1230s3.html" target="_self">What is a binary file format?</a>
sidebar). The Linux community is in a state of transition from the
old &ldquo;a.out&rdquo; binary file format to the new &ldquo;ELF&rdquo; binary file
format, which has many features that are completely missing in the
a.out format.</p><p>ELF is the binary file format used by Unix System V Release
4, but that doesn't mean that a Linux binary in the ELF file format
is compatible with SVR4, nor does it mean that SVR4 binaries can
run on Linux. The capability for Linux to run some SVR3 and SVR4
binaries is provided by the iBCS2 compatibility package, which most
distributions include.</p><p>One of ELF's features is extensibility; with ELF, it is
possible for developers to add features that weren't thought of
when the format was first designed. For instance, one Linux
developer has noted that he could add icons to ELF executables
without breaking any software. Icons weren't considered when ELF
was developed, but the format is extensible enough that they can be
easily added.</p><p>But perhaps you don't care if you can add an icon to your ELF
binary, or even if anyone else can. What does ELF do for you?
Fundamentally, it makes life much easier for Linux developers. It
also has a few esoteric features which make it practical to support
some software under Linux that was previously impractical to
support. So it gives you more and better software available for
Linux.</p><p>Since the whole Linux community is moving to ELF, you don't
want to get stuck with a distribution which does not support ELF. A
year from now, it will be almost impossible to find a.out binaries
for programs you want, and important bug fixes may only be
available for ELF.</p><p>Because of this, we have only reviewed distributions which at
least support ELF binaries. The only distributions that are
reviewed here which are not <span   class="bold"><b>based</b></span>
on the most current ELF libraries are currently being updated, and
should be based on standard ELF libraries by the time you read
this.</p><p>What do we mean by
<span   class="bold"><b>based</b></span>?</p><p>ELF-based means the entire distribution, or at least, almost
the entire distribution, consists of ELF binaries. a.out binaries
are not provided with the system, or if they are provided, they
aren't part of the &ldquo;core&rdquo; of the system or are not available in
ELF format.</p><p>By contrast, &ldquo;supports ELF&rdquo; means that, while the
distribution is partially or completely built of binaries in the
a.out format, the ELF <span   class="bold"><b>programming
libraries</b></span> are included so that ELF binaries will also
run.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2156580.0x224f000"></a>Media</h2></div></div><p>Many distributions are available solely on CD-ROM. There are
several reasons for this:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>So much software is available for Linux that it is
impractical to provide it all on floppies.</p></li><li><p>It is much easier to install software from CD-ROM
than to change floppies once a minute.</p></li><li><p>A cheap supported CD-ROM drive costs approximately
the same as the stack of floppies needed to install a complete
Linux distribution.</p></li></ul></div><p>However, some distributions (including Debian, Red Hat, and
Slackware) are available via FTP over the Internet in a form
designed to fit on floppies, and Linux System Labs still offers a
floppy distribution service, from which you can order an entire
Linux distribution on floppies, though it is the only company left,
to our knowledge, which does this.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2156580.0x224f3c8"></a>Copyright Considerations</h2></div></div><p>Most distributions are freely available over the Internet,
although only some are actively distributed in a way that makes it
feasible to install them directly from the Internet. You should be
aware that while distributors can restrict you from running
commercial software components on more than one machine, they
cannot restrict you from installing the base Linux software on
multiple machines. A Linux distribution which is packaged in a form
which cannot be installed without installing proprietary software
that is under copyright licensing terms more strict than the GNU
General Public License is probably in violation of copyright law.
[And should be completely avoided, in my strongly held
opinion&mdash;ED]</p><p>To sum up, you should feel free to install any Linux
distribution you buy on as many machines as you like, as long as
you respect the licensing terms of any proprietary software that is
included with the distribution. Conversely, the vendor needs to
make it possible for you to do so without taking unreasonable
steps.</p><p>If you encounter a vendor who makes it difficult or
impossible to install free components without installing
proprietary components that have restrictive licenses, first
politely bring the issue to their attention&mdash;they may not have
considered the issue. If the vendor refuses to resolve the issue,
return the distribution, ask for your money back, and send a letter
to the Editor of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2156580.0x224f5d8"></a>The Future</h2></div></div><p>By the time you read this, some of the distributions will
have made new releases, and so some of this description will be out
of date. We hope all the bugs will have been fixed, for
instance...</p><p>We would like to keep tracking distributions as they improve
and, occasionally, publish descriptions and the feature comparison
table in updated form.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2156580.0x224f738"></a>Missing Bugs</h2></div></div><p>One thing you may notice missing from this overview is a list
of bugs in each distribution. In general, we assume that some
noticeable bugs are inevitable in software that is evolving as
quickly as Linux and that vendors will be responsive in tracking
and eradicating bugs. If they aren't, word of mouth between users
will be more effective than any sort of complaining on our part. We
also want to avoid showing any bias, and if we start listing bugs
we find, we will either show bias or appear to show bias simply by
the &ldquo;choice&rdquo; of bugs we publish.</p><p>Since we can't do a fair comparison of the number and
severity of bugs between distributions, we have tried to note only
bugs that involved completely missing functionality or which were
difficult to work around and hard for the user to avoid.</p><p>If working around simple bugs is a problem for you, we urge
you to purchase a distribution from a vendor who offers technical
support for the installation process. By providing installation
technical support, these vendors not only help you with the
problems, but force on themselves a vested interest in fixing those
bugs. Providing support is expensive, and solving the same problem
over and over again is a waste of their time and money.</p><p>At the same time, if you buy installation technical support,
please understand that you aren't buying a lifetime warranty for
every part of the system. None of the vendors here provide that as
part of their base product. You can buy very comprehensive support
packages from several vendors if you need them. Happy
shopping!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2156580.0x224f948"></a>Debian .93R6</h2></div></div><p>The only distribution in this lineup which is not currently
developed on a commercial basis (Slackware was originally also
non-commercial), Debian has been a long time in the making. Unlike
all the other Linux distributions, Debian is put together by a
large team of volunteers all over the world. While a few people are
in charge of a very small core of the distribution, almost all the
decisions are made by consensus (which has given Debian a
reputation for vaporware, since consensus can take some time to
achieve), and nearly all of the packages are developed
independently by members of a large development team.</p><p>By following a strict set of rules and using the most
powerful packaging technology currently available for Linux, this
large team has achieved a remarkably coherent Linux package. As
this article is being written, Debian is still the
<span   class="bold"><b>only</b></span> distribution which has
complete <span   class="emphasis"><em>dependencies</em></span>: when you install one
package, it checks to see if other needed packages are also
installed. It also checks version numbers if requested; package
<span   class="bold"><b>A</b></span> can insist that package
<span   class="bold"><b>B</b></span> be installed, and that package
<span   class="bold"><b>B</b></span> be version
<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> or greater. This makes upgrading any package
nearly foolproof.</p><p>These dependencies are a natural requirement of Debian's
distributed development and are well-tested, because many of
Debian's users and developers upgrade parts of their systems on an
as-necessary basis, which exercises the dependency-checking
features considerably.</p><p>The Debian installation procedure does not have as many of
the user-friendly assumptions as many other distributions. It won't
guess at which disks you wish to use or which partitions on your
disks you wish to use for swap and root, for instance. It doesn't
give you the option to skip the check for bad blocks while making a
file system. It installs the entire &ldquo;base&rdquo; system from floppy
(three floppies), and then you reboot into the installed system
with enough programs installed to install any other packages you
like. This way, all the base system has to support is floppies and
hard drives, and then you can choose which kernel modules to load
during the initial &ldquo;base&rdquo; installation; those determine what
hardware is supported. Debian is highly modularized.</p><p>Debian is one of the strictest distributions about setting
passwords. As soon as you re-boot the &ldquo;base&rdquo; system, you are
prompted for the root password, with an explanation of how to
choose a good password. Also, part of adding a new user under
Debian is setting the user's password.</p><p>All of Debian's packaging tools run in text mode, so X is not
required to use any of Debian's sophisticated upgrade capabilities.
They can be used in an xterm or rxvt on the console, over a modem
link or over the network. The package tools are also very
fast.</p><p>The default Debian kernel is highly modularized. This means
that you rarely need to recompile the kernel, and you don't have
lots of unnecessary, unused drivers in the kernel taking up memory
and causing possible conflicts. Where Red Hat has 72 possible boot
disks in its standard set, Debian has 1&mdash;but Red Hat requires you
to make only 3 disks to install, whereas Debian requires you to
make 5 disks, and have an extra blank disk available, which is used
to make another boot disk during the installation process (you can
re-use the boot or root disk if you are brave, but we don't
recommend it).</p><p>Debian is currently being transformed from an a.out-based
distribution with optional ELF support to a fully ELF-based
distribution. By the time you read this, a new release of Debian
fully based on ELF should have been released; most of the Debian
<span   class="bold"><b>packages</b></span> have already been made
available in ELF format. Debian 1.1 will be fully ELF-based. (Due
to a mis-communication, a version called Debian 1.0 was released on
the November Infomagic CD. That version was incomplete and will not
work if you attempt to install it. The real release has been
renumbered 1.1 in order to avoid confusion between the official
ELF-based release and the one accidentally included on the
Infomagic CD.)</p><p>Debian's home page can be found on the Web at
<a href="http://www.debian.org" target="_self">www.debian.org</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2156580.0x2648220"></a>Craftworks Linux 2.0</h2></div></div><p>This relative newcomer SoftCraft Linux, by SolutionS R Us)
has relatively few packages, each of which contains many files.
Craftworks Linux comes with a boot floppy, a CD-ROM, and a
manual.</p><p>We ran up against one bit of confusion right away: as soon as
we booted from the provided floppy, an unclear copyright message
was presented that seemed to appropriate title to Linux and seemed
to attempt to legally restrict the user from installing the product
on more than one machine.</p><p>Following our own advice, we contacted Craftworks and asked
their intention. They confirmed that their intention was only to
protect their own proprietary software included with the
distribution, and that they allow users to install the product on
as many systems as they wish. They do claim compilation copyright
on the CD-ROM and the floppy, which means that they restrict the
user from making any verbatim copies of either the CD-ROM or the
floppy except for backup purposes. However, they in no way intend
to restrict re-distribution of any included free software, and they
promised to resolve the issue by making their copyright licensing
terms and notices much clearer in future versions of the
product.</p><p>The installation was fairly simple; Craftworks provides three
pre-selected sets of packages to install (other packages can be
installed separately after the base installation has been
completed). This makes it quite simple to install a simple but
usable Linux system fairly quickly.</p><p>While Softcraft claims compliance with the Linux File System
Standard (the &ldquo;FSSTND&rdquo;), the default locations that come with
many free software packages have been accepted, and so they
expressly violate the FSSTND by installing several packages in the
/usr/local hierarchy. They don't include documentation (at least in
the manual) on how and where they deviate from the FSSTND, either.
However, most of the base system does appear to follow the
FSSTND.</p><p>A Softcraft system with extra packages (more than the base
system) installed feels something like a SunOS system with an
active system administrator. Plenty of files are in /usr/local
(including Emacs), and other files are tucked away in other various
corners; for example, Postgres95 is in the /usr/local/postgres95/
directory. Softcraft responds that they do this so that users
familiar with commercial versions of Unix will feel
comfortable.</p><p>The X configuration was very simple&mdash;there were only two
questions to answer (type of mouse and type of video board).
However, this provides a 640x480 pixel X configuration; to get any
better resolution, the user is instructed to edit the
/etc/XF86Config file by hand.</p><p>Craftworks' home page is at
<a href="http://www.craftwork.com" target="_self">www.craftwork.com</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2156580.0x26485e8"></a>Linux Universe</h2></div></div><p>Linux Universe is a book with simple installation and
configuration instructions and a small reference, which includes a
CD with a Linux distribution on it. It's translated from German,
and the distribution on it is also apparently translated from
German, since some of the comments in the scripts are still in
German.</p><p>While it is completely ELF-based, the version available at
the time of testing used the version 4 ELF library, not the new
version 5 ELF libraries used by all the other ELF-based
distributions. When Linux Universe was produced, the version 5
libraries were still in alpha testing and not ready for release.
However, we have been assured that the new version, which should be
available in stores by the time you read this, will have the
version 5 ELF libraries. If you wish to run Linux binaries other
than those included with the system, make sure you get the newer
version.</p><p>Also unlike any of the other Linux distributions here, it
doesn't include LILO. Instead, it provides a full-screen boot
manager somewhat like OS/2's boot manager, which is easy to
configure and is able to read ext2fs file systems&mdash;so it is able to
boot any kernel on an ext2fs file system, not just ones that have
been specially configured, as with LILO. However, the full-screen
loader is itself loaded by a very simple loader that can be
confusing to the new user. It requires you to remember which
partitions of which drives hold the operating systems you want to
boot.</p><p>Linux Universe is intended to be a companion to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux&mdash;Unleashing the Workstation in your PC,</em></span>
by the same authors, and you can purchase Linux Universe alone or
in a kit with its companion volume. If you are not already familiar
with Linux (or at least Unix), you will want to purchase the whole
kit, not just Linux Universe.</p><p>Linux Universe is designed (like Yggdrasil) to be run with
the system CD in the drive, so that even packages that are not
installed on the hard drive can still be run. Linux Universe adds
technology which causes files accessed on the CD to be
automatically copied to the hard drive for future access. The same
design is used to install and run it from an NFS server.</p><p>The graphical configuration utility is simple to use and
seems to work well. It works quickly and intelligently. When
filling out the networking configuration, for example, it guesses
most of the information once you type in the IP address.</p><p>You can find Linux Universe on the Web at
<a href="http://www.springer-ny.com/samples/linux/linux.html" target="_self">www.springer-ny.com/samples/linux/linux.html</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2156580.0x26489b0"></a>Red Hat Commercial Linux 2.1</h2></div></div><p>The first commercial distribution to adopt an upgradable
packaging scheme, Red Hat's 2.1 release includes a single-command
upgrade facility. A single script was included to do the upgrade
from Red Hat 2.0 or 2.0Beta to 2.1, and it worked very well. At the
end of the upgrade, it notifies the user which configuration files
have been changed and the names of the files where the originals
have been saved.</p><p>Unfortunately, going from version 2.0 to 2.1, it replaced the
/etc/passwd and /etc/group files (among others) with new ones that
had new administrative users, but didn't include any users that had
been added to the system since the original install of Red Hat 2.0.
No tool was provided to merge the old and new password files,
either. Fortunately, Red Hat considers this a bug and will fix it
in future releases. It is also fortunate that the previous versions
were preserved&mdash;Red Hat's RPM tool always makes a backup when
changing configuration files&mdash;and the upgrade script warned about
the change, making it a simple matter to move the original versions
back into place.</p><p>With this small, easily-fixed exception, the Red Hat upgrade
process ran smoothly and took only a few minutes to upgrade a
rather fully configured system to the latest version of Red Hat
with proper configuration files in place. Red Hat has plans to
improve the upgrading process so that it is even smoother for more
people; in nearly all cases in the future, a single command should
be entirely sufficient.</p><p>In general, Red Hat provides a reasonably wide range of
applications on multiple architectures. In December 1995, at
DECUS/San Francisco, Red Hat announced Red Hat Linux for Alpha,
which runs on several different Digital Alpha systems. Red Hat's
packaging scheme is designed to support multiple architectures
transparently, including building packages, and Red Hat has
announced that they are considering other architectures as
well.</p><p>Red Hat includes a graphical package management tool, as well
as a command-line tool. However, their assumption is that people
who don't want or need to edit configuration files directly will
configure and use X, and their configuration tools are almost
entirely X-based.</p><p>Red Hat provides your choice of graphical and text-based
installations, and can install from CD-ROM, NFS, floppy, or FTP.
The floppy and FTP installations only work in text-based mode at
the moment. The installation asks as many questions as necessary
immediately and then installs <span   class="bold"><b>all</b></span>
the applications, not requiring user interaction again until after
all the packages have been installed.</p><p>Red Hat provides their own easy-to-use X configuration
program called the Xconfigurator. It uses dialog boxes that ask
fairly easy questions to write an XF86Config file to configure
X.</p><p>The URL for Red Hat's home page is
<a href="http://www.redhat.com" target="_self">www.redhat.com</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2156580.0x2648dd0"></a>Slackware 3.0</h2></div></div><p>This veteran descendent of the original Linux distribution,
SLS, is still easy to install, if you don't mind tending it while
it asks questions. It has wide support for installation from
different media&mdash;it even has experimental support for installing
from tape drives&mdash;and it still has the best support for installing
from floppies. It also has a very wide selection of available
software. If you want to use TeX to typeset Klingon or Tengwar,
it's built in; just make the right selections while installing.
Slackware has a long history and has a rich assortment of packages.
Most of the 1000-page tomes covering Linux which are available in
any bookstore cover Slackware, so it is also
well-documented.</p><p>However, Slackware has no real upgradability. To upgrade a
package (which is simply a .tar.gz file), you can only remove the
old package and install the new one. For a technically advanced
user who remembers all the configuration files for the package, who
knows exactly what files to back up before doing an upgrade
process, and has time to do so, that works, except when the user
makes mistakes.</p><p>Slackware uses the standard XFree86 xf86config program to
configure X, which is not particularly user-friendly, though very
thorough. Once you get X running, however, you can take advantage
of Slackware's fairly wide variety of X applications.</p><p>If you don't mind re-installing regularly to upgrade and
demand very fine-grained control over exactly which files get
installed, Slackware provides some of the most precise controls
over what gets installed and what does not. For instance, if hard
drive space is limited, and you want to install
<span   class="bold"><b>only</b></span> the TeX fonts you want, most
of them are selected separately. Thai fonts, OCR fonts, and Gothic
German fonts are perhaps not likely to be used by the same people;
Slackware allows you to select each of those families (and many
more) separately. If you want as many packages as possible provided
with the distribution, you will appreciate Slackware's wide range
of available software. We counted 326 packages in Slackware
3.0.</p><p>Slackware's Web site is at

had continued popularity due in part to graphical configuration,
bootable floppies included with the distribution, and multimedia
support.</p><p>Yggdrasil has had a history of including kernels with patches
they have tested, but which aren't included in the standard Linux
kernel. Fall '95 continues this tradition.</p><p>After installing the &ldquo;Suggested&rdquo; configuration (at 250 MB,
the only choice smaller than &ldquo;Everything&rdquo;, which takes 600MB), it
is impossible to compile the kernel without either mounting the CD
or installing some packages that aren't installed as a part of the
&ldquo;Suggested&rdquo; configuration. The manual doesn't say what packages
need to be installed to build the kernel with the CD removed, and
since the control panel doesn't show which packages are already
installed, it's not clear what packages need to be installed. Even
after installing all the needed software components, we still had
to figure out that we had to remove
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/version.h in order to successfully
build the kernel; we were not able to find that in the
documentation. This would not have been an important issue except
for the fact that the standard kernel didn't support the 3C509
Ethernet card, and we needed to build a kernel with 3C509 support
in order to test the networking setup. Further testing showed that
several functions of the basic control panel, such as printing,
also did not function with the &ldquo;Suggested&rdquo; configuration unless
the CD-ROM was mounted.</p><p>Although running Yggdrasil without the system CD mounted can
take some work, Yggdrasil is one of the few distributions able to
run entirely from the CD. This capability has been included with
Yggdrasil for some time and is a great way to demonstrate Linux to
skeptical friends. Not surprisingly, running multimedia
applications under X entirely from the CD-ROM takes considerable
memory; it doesn't work well with less than 16 MB of memory.</p><p>Yggdrasil doesn't set up networking as part of the
installation, but it does provide a graphical tool for setting up
basic networking once you get X set up. It also has a reasonably
easy X setup program that gets invoked automatically when you start
X, if you haven't already configured X. It also tells you how to
re-run the configuration if you aren't satisfied with the first
configuration you produce.</p><p>Yggdrasil doesn't come with some programs that are now
considered standard with Linux, such as
<span   class="bold"><b>rxvt</b></span>. On the other hand, it does
seem to include a fairly full range of multimedia tools. The PC
Speaker sound patches, which provide sound capabilities through the
standard PC speaker, are already applied to the supplied kernel
source tree and are one of the configuration options. Yggdrasil
also comes with XEmacs, a version of Emacs with a good graphical
user interface.</p><p>You will find Yggdrasil on the Web at
<a href="http://www.yggdrasil.com" target="_self">www.yggdrasil.com</a>.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Reading the Feature</b></span>
<a href="1230f1a.html" target="_self">Chart</a></p><p>First, a word of warning: while the feature chart is intended
to help you compare the features offered by different
distributions, it doesn't say anything about the quality of the
features. The chart doesn't tell the whole story, nor does this
article, because it is impossible for a chart or article to do so.
The chart <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> give you an idea of what the
vendors are trying to provide with their distributions.</p><p>A &ldquo;no&rdquo; isn't necessarily a strike against a distribution.
Don't sit down and count up the number of boxes with &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in
them and consider that a reasonable ranking of the distributions.
Instead, consider the features that
<span   class="bold"><b>you</b></span> particularly want and need. If
you have further questions, contact the vendors and ask. Buy from
vendors with a money-back guarantee if you are worried that you
will get stuck with a distribution you don't want.</p><p>The labels on the feature chart (page FIXME) aren't entirely
self-explanatory, as you may have already noticed. An explanation
of the entire chart is in order here. If there is any part that you
don't understand or are not interested in, feel free to skip it.
Starting from the top...</p><p>Like everything else, the <span   class="bold"><b>vendor's list
price</b></span> isn't necessarily the price you will pay. Nearly
all of these distributions are re-sold. Also, like Linux itself,
Debian has no official vendor and no official vendor price. The
Debian distribution is made available for ftp from ftp.debian.org,
and several vendors provide it, either as the sole distribution on
a CD or as part of a collection.</p><p>Slackware, Debian, and Red Hat are all contained on archive
CDs containing snapshots of ftp sites. They don't come with paper
manuals when you buy them that way, but they are often less
expensive. Technical support is not included with most archive CDs,
so if you expect to need a helping hand with your installation,
this may not be the easiest way for you to go.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Packaging</b></span> is technology for
easily and correctly installing, removing, and upgrading parts of
the system. Each part would include several inter-related files.
For example, all the standard include files would probably be
included in the same part. The first line of the Packaging section
indicates whether you can at least add and remove packages with the
provided package management tools.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Package upgradability</b></span>
involves preserving (as much as possible) the configuration of the
package correctly on the hard drive while installing a new version.
This involves at the very least some method of distinguishing
configuration files from other files, so that when you upgrade, a
package's configuration files are not changed, and you do not have
to re-configure the package. If the package management tools are
unable to preserve the configuration untouched (for example, if the
format of a configuration file changes with a new version), the
package management tools need to notify the administrator of that
fact.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Dependencies</b></span> are a
capability which allows one package to require that another package
also be installed. For instance, LaTeX requires that TeX also be
installed, so if LaTeX and TeX are provided in separate packages,
the package containing LaTeX may require that the TeX package be
installed first, since the functionality of LaTeX depends on
it.</p><p>Dependencies are usually absolute; a package either requires
or does not require another package in order to function. Debian
allows fine shades of distinction: A package can absolutely depend
on another package being installed, it can recommend that any sane
user would want the additional package installed, or it can suggest
that you will probably want to install the other package.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Format</b></span> refers to the way
that packages are maintained on the installation media. Debian and
Red Hat each use special archives of their own design which contain
the extra information needed to implement their extra features.
Slackware installs standard &ldquo;.tar.gz&rdquo; or &ldquo;.tgz&rdquo; archives
created by using tar to archive a set of files and gzip to compress
the archive; those archives do not, therefore, have the extra
information needed to remove or upgrade archives. Yggdrasil and
Linux Universe install by copying files directly from a file system
on the CD-ROM to the hard drive, so they can only use their package
management tools to install from the installation CD.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Third-party packages</b></span> are
closely related to format; those distributions which provide
single-file packages are capable of installing packages built by
third parties, downloaded from the Internet or found on other CDs.
As an example of what can be done with third-party packages,
Caldera built the Caldera Network Desktop upon Red Hat Commercial
Linux (RHCL) and added new packages in Red Hat's RPM format to
create a new distribution that is essentially a superset of
RHCL.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Source packages</b></span> means the
source code is also installable with the package management
tools</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Buildable Source</b></span> means the
package has the capability to build entire packages with one
command (which may or may not be integrated with the package
management tools).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Multi-architecture</b></span> means
support for more than one binary architecture. The Intel 80386 and
above (denoted here as i86) is certainly the most common CPU
architecture supported, but Linux also runs on other platforms,
including some Amigas and Ataris, DEC's Alpha, the Acorn
Archimedes, and Sparc. Some of the distributions are beginning to
include support for more than one architecture. We expect that by
the time you read this chart, support for more architectures will
be, at least, announced by more distributions.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Graphical and text-based package
management</b></span> refer to the tools available for managing
packages. <span   class="bold"><b>Graphical</b></span> refers to
native X-based tools, and
<span   class="bold"><b>text-based</b></span> refers to those that
run in character more (even in an Xterm or rxvt session).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Series sub-selection</b></span> refers
to logically grouping packages together into intelligent groups,
but also being able to select individual components. For instance,
making a group or series which contains everything related to the
TeX typesetting system, but being able to separately choose each
individual part separately.</p><p>Over the past year, the Linux community has been slowly
migrating from the a.out to the ELF <span   class="bold"><b>binary
file format</b></span>. ELF has many advantages, but it has been
necessary to move slowly to avoid causing more pain than necessary.
However, ELF is now the standard, and we have purposely not
included any distributions that do not at least support ELF
binaries.</p><p>ELF-based distributions can choose to include a.out
libraries, in order to provide support for legacy
applications.</p><p>Most distributions (all in this lineup) provide iBCS2 support
for binaries from many i86 Unix platforms.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Supported architectures</b></span> are
the types of machines supported by the distribution.</p><p>The standard PC architecture doesn't provide a standard way
to boot from CD-ROMs, so in order to install Linux, it is not
possible to simply boot a Linux CD-ROM. [No letters to the editor
telling us that the Adaptec 2940 provides support for booting from
a CD-ROM; that's not &ldquo;support by the standard PC
architecture&rdquo;&mdash;ED] This means that the distribution needs to
provide some other way of booting. There are essentially two ways
of doing this. One is to provide a bootable floppy disk containing
the Linux kernel, and the other is to rely on already having DOS
installed. Several distributions provide both options.</p><p>In order to boot from a floppy, either:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>a bootable floppy needs to be included with the
distribution, or</p></li><li><p>a way needs to be provided to make a floppy from
files on the CD-ROM.</p></li></ul></div><p>Unfortunately, it's hard to make a single floppy that is
sufficient for booting on all platforms, but failing to supply a
floppy with a kernel makes the user rely on having another
operating system (DOS, Linux, or any version of Unix will do) to
use to create the floppy. Fortunately, this is rarely a problem,
but if you have no other operating system available (even on a
friend's computer...) to use to write the necessary floppies, you
will probably want to seriously consider purchasing a distribution
which provides the necessary floppies as part of the
package.</p><p>It is possible to boot Linux directly from DOS, and some
distributions provide an option to use no boot floppies at all by
first booting DOS and then booting Linux from the CD-ROM. In this
collection, Linux Universe provides this choice, as well as the
option of booting from a floppy.</p><p>Some distributions provide a wide variety of boot images,
whereas others use one or only a few. If you are able to make
floppies yourself, those with more boot floppy choices
<span   class="emphasis"><em>may</em></span> prove easier to configure for your
hardware. The <span   class="bold"><b>Boot Images</b></span> line
doesn't count duplicates for different size drives; it only counts
the choices for one size of floppy drive.</p><p>All the distributions provide at least the option of booting
from floppy, and all of them provide a way to make your own boot
floppies from the CD-ROM under DOS and/or Linux. Some also provide
some assistance (under DOS, Linux, or both) to make choosing and/or
creating the floppy or floppy set easier. For instance, Red Hat
provides a perl script which asks questions about the configuration
you are interested in and then creates disks appropriate for your
hardware configuration.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>number of floppies
required</b></span> to install the system varies widely. Debian
installs its entire &ldquo;base system&rdquo; from a set of five floppies and
then requires one blank floppy after the install to create an
appropriate boot disk. If you boot the Linux Universe CD-ROM from
DOS, it can install without any floppies at all.</p><p>While most of this article has assumed that you are
installing from CD-ROM (after all, that's what most of the vendors
provide), that's not necessarily true. You may wish to copy
packages to a subdirectory of a local hard drive and install from
there, or you may wish to install from floppy or via NFS from a
local server or via anonymous FTP or from a tape.</p><p>In order to install on most notebooks, support for PCMCIA
(also known as PC Card) is required, unless you are want to install
one of the distributions that are available on floppies and are
interested in shuffling floppies for hours. If you have a PCMCIA
Ethernet or SCSI adaptor supported by the Linux PCMCIA card
services package, some distributions make it possible for you to do
a network installation over Ethernet, or a install from a SCSI
CD-ROM connected to a SCSI adaptor. This can be a real
time-saver.</p><p>If you don't want to partition your disk, some distributions
provide the option of installing in a <b  >LINUX</b>
subdirectory of a DOS file system using a Linux file system called
UMSDOS. While this imposes on Linux all the inefficiencies of the
DOS file system, it is an easy way to get started using Linux
without committing a partition to do so. Yggdrasil goes one step
farther, allowing you to install the base Linux system without
booting Linux, by using a DOS program to do the
installation.</p><p>Most distributions now have customized documentation written
about them, which is either included with the distribution by
default or is available as an option. Some distributions have been
covered in other books available in the bookstore; we have
mentioned their presence under <span   class="bold"><b>Alternate
Books</b></span>. Some distributions are covered by
freely-available documentation; the
<span   class="bold"><b>Installation HOWTO</b></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Installation and Getting Started</em></span>
currently cover Slackware primarily, and Debian's manual is
distributed freely via the Internet, including an HTML version on
www.debian.org.</p><p>Some distributions provide the capability to run nearly or
completely from CD-ROM, which can be an effective way to
demonstrate or experiment with Linux.</p><p>One of the most difficult parts of configuring a Linux system
is configuring the X Window System. The XFree86 project, Inc.
provides a configuration program called xf86config, which has a
fairly basic user interface and requires you to know a lot about
your configuration, but is quite complete. Some distributions
provide tools to make X configuration easier.</p><p>Some vendors provide a support program, and some provide
several different support programs. This chart only mentions
whether at least one program is available&mdash;check with the vendors
if you have specific requirements that you need met.</p><p>While all of these distributions are available via CD-ROM,
some are also sold in other formats. There is still one third-party
vendor (Linux System Labs) which provides Slackware on floppy, and
several of the vendors provide their distribution over the Internet
via anonymous FTP.</p><p>Some of the distributions include configuration tools, mostly
graphical ones. If you are not familiar with administering a Linux
or Unix system, you are likely to find most common tasks simplified
by a user interface that handles common tasks easily. None of the
configuration tools provided with any of the distributions prevents
you from doing your configuration by hand, so there is no reason to
complain if you prefer to configure your system by hand.</p><p>In particular, we looked for configuration tools for setting
up and maintaining a network, adding and deleting users and groups,
mounting and un-mounting file systems, setting up print services,
and manipulating boot scripts (generally kept in /etc/init.d).
Again, we did not try to rank them in usefulness, and some of the
scripts were definitely more functional for our purposes. On the
other hand, a script with more functionality than one user needs
could include needless, confusing detail for another user.
Configuration scripts should have a review of their own some day,
but mentioning whether or not they exist is a first step.</p><p>Last, but not least, some distributions require more memory
to install than others. Some distributions install with only 4MB of
memory, but others require 8MB. As new versions of the
distributions are released, their memory requirements may change.
If you have less than 8MB of memory, it will probably be worth your
while to find out how much memory is currently required by each of
the distributions you are considering.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2156580.0x255c710"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>Linux distributions have changed a lot in the few years they
have been around. The Linux File system Standard has improved their
ability to inter-operate; binaries compiled for one distribution
are now more likely to run on another distribution, because
standard files are more likely to be in the same place from one
distribution to another. As distributions have competed, bugs have
been worked out of all of them; thus users have benefited from
distributions they haven't even used.</p><p>Since no single distribution provides an optimal environment
for everyone, each distribution contributes something to the pot.
Furthermore, having distributions targeted for different kinds of
users means that no distribution is pressured into complete
mediocrity by the attempt to be all things to all people. It's a
well-worn clich that to do all things equally well is to do nothing
at all well...</p></div></div>
