George Eckel and Chris Hare
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Publisher:</b></span> New Riders</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ISBN:</b></span> 1-56205-525-9</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Price:</b></span> $40.00</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Reviewer:</b></span> Phil Hughes</p><p>The first thing that caught my eye about this book is that it
is about doing something with Linux. Up until this point the major
focus of Linux books has been how to install it, how to network it,
what commands are available and such. This book, instead, offers
the reader a chance to implement something which just happens to
use Linux.</p><p>Let me quickly cover what I found wrong with this book. It in
no way detracts from the usability of the book, only from the
number of copies that are likely to be sold. The problem is that
the audience isn't identified. As I read the book I continued to
wonder who would really want to buy it. Sections start off with
introductory material but quickly (in a few pages) get to the nitty
gritty of command options and configuration files.</p><p>Finally, when I had finished reading the book and thought
about it, I realized that the book was intended for someone like
me. That is, someone with lots of Unix experience but a minimum of
experience setting up Internet servers. Or the Unix systems
administrator who was just told by his boss that the company was
about to have a Web presence and he should implement it. The
problem could easily be solved with a one-page Preface (are you
listening New Riders?), and I would expect sales to jump.</p><p>That said, let's get to the content of the book. The first
part covers an introduction to the Internet and talks about the
ideas behind a business presence and advertising on the Internet.
This part includes profiles of users, trends and a look at
companies that are already on the Internet (primarily as WWW
sites).</p><p>If part one convinced you, part two goes on to cover how to
get connected. After a brief look at terminology and connection
characteristics, the book goes on to cover the types of services
you may want. Their list includes finger, telnet, e-mail, ftp,
WAIS, Archie, Gopher and World Wide Web. Part two ends with
information on types of connections with associated costs, legal
considerations and security.</p><p>Assuming you want to go through with the mission of offering
services, part three of the book goes on to describe each service
and show you how to get it up and running. This amounts to about
half the book (150 pages) and covers Linux installation basics and
how to set up ftp, freeWAIS, Gopher and WWW services. There is also
a section on ZDIST, beta software that offers enhanced
functionality over freeWAIS.</p><p>While seeing a description of how to set up freeWAIS is very
rare (and, if you need it, well worth the cost of the book), I
expect the service most often offered is WWW. There are huge books
written on just setting up a WWW site, but in less than 20 pages,
this book manages to explain where to get client software, how to
set up the NCSA server software and how to get started. The next
chapter goes on to cover management of WWW services and includes
some design information, sources of conversion utilities, log
management and analysis, CGI and security.</p><p>Appendices cover available Gopher services and sources of
free software on the net. Finally, a short glossary covers the
common terms you would expect to be new to the
Internet-neophyte.</p><p>The CD-ROM has Slackware Linux on it (version 2.0.1) plus
what appears to be a browser for some operating system that uses
programs with names that end in .exe and .dll. Not having that
system I was not able to evaluate this. Also, as Slackware 1.0.1 is
history, the CD is not the exciting part of the book.</p><p>In conclusion, if you know what you are doing with a Unix
system and are considering setting up some sort of Internet server,
the book is well worth the money. And if you think your company
should set up such a server but you need to convince management,
there is enough in this book that they can read and understand to
explain why it is a good (or not so good) idea.</p></div></div>
