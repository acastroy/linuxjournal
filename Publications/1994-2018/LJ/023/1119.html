    Gerald Graefs provides a comprehensive guide through the jumble of
    graphics formats currently available.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d00580.0x1df8500"></a></h2></div></div><p>If there is a single unifying feature of
the computer world, it is non-conformity. In no place is this
better illustrated than computer graphics. Literally dozens of
different formats exist to do the same thing: store graphic images.
Proprietary formats, independent free standards, and international
standards all vie for attention. Fortunately, the computer
community has settled on just a handful of formats. Some, like
TIFF, are the jacks-of-all-trades and are widely used. Others, like
GIF, have a niche that they dominate. But whatever the context,
there is always more than one way to store images.
</p><p>This article first provides a brief introduction to graphics
on Linux, including format and type, compression, file structure,
and various features. It then continues with descriptions of the
common graphics formats found in the Linux world and programs with
which to manipulate them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d00580.0x1df8660"></a>Format</h2></div></div><p>Graphics formats come in two basic varieties:
<span   class="bold"><b>raster</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>vector</b></span>. Raster formats store the
entire image pixel by pixel and are the most commonly-used formats.
Vector formats, also called descriptive formats, do not contain
pixel image data; instead, they contain a series of commands
telling a display program how to draw the image.</p><p>The most common use of vector formats is in computer aided
drafting (CAD). Describing a line, for example, as a starting
point, an ending point, and a color, as opposed to many colored
points in a field of points, allows a program to manipulate the
line as an object, making it easy to change color, length, and
position. Another common use is in raytracing programs. These
programs take geometric objects and trace the path of light rays to
find shadows and highlights. Since the rendered objects are
geometric shapes, it is much easier to store an image as
&ldquo;dodecahedron at (3,4,3) with size 2 and color 27&rdquo; than as an
array of pixel values, especially since the scene to be rendered is
three-dimensional. Of course, once the scene is raytraced, the
resulting image is stored in a raster format.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d00580.0x1df8870"></a>Type</h2></div></div><p>Images come in four basic types: monochrome (black and
white), grayscale, color palette, and true color.</p><p>Grayscale and color palette images typically have 2, 4, or 8
bits per pixel. They use lookup tables that must be included in the
image file; each entry in the color lookup table gives the red,
green, and blue values for a color. Grayscale images have a similar
lookup table for gray values. Each color or gray value is in a
range of 0-3 for 2-bit images, 0-15 for 4-bit images, and 0-255 for
8-bit images. The actual image pixel data is a series of color or
gray values corresponding to table entries which give the actual
color of each pixel.</p><p>True color images are 24-bit images and are usually stored as
8 bits of red, 8 bits of green, and 8 bits of blue per pixel. Some
formats may use different color models than RGB. The JPEG format,
for example, uses a colorspace based on the luminance and two
chrominance values (YCbCr). True color images do not need a color
lookup table or palette.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d00580.0x1df8a28"></a>Compression</h2></div></div><p>Compression is integral to most graphics formats. An
uncompressed 640x400x256 color image requires just over 256,000
bytes, while a true color image of the same size requires
three-quarters of a megabyte. Although many compression schemes
exist, only a few are common in graphics applications. LZW, LZ77,
Huffman, and run-length encoding are lossless, meaning that the
image is reproduced exactly when uncompressed. The cosine transform
is the basis for the &ldquo;lossy&rdquo; JPEG format. We aren't concerned
with the details of the compression schemes here.</p><p>JPEG gives by far the best compression, but at the expense of
exact image reproduction and speed. Acceptable results are common
with compression ratios of 25 to 1, that is, the compressed file is
25 times smaller than the original. Ratios of 100 to 1 may be
possible if image quality is not a primary concern.</p><p>[FOOTNOTE:A better algorithm does exist, however: fractal
image compression. This method gives good results at 100 to 1 and
is finding many applications, though it has not yet been widely
implemented as a general purpose graphics format.]</p><p>LZW and LZ77 are the best lossless schemes and produce
similar results: usually around 2 to 1 compression. The modified
LZ77 used in the PNG graphics format is slightly slower at
compressing images than LZW, but it creates smaller files and is
faster at decompressing. LZ77 is also used by the general purpose
compression programs ZIP, GZIP, and PKZIP. Until recently, the use
of LZW was much more common than LZ77. Its use is falling, however,
because it is a patented algorithm, and UNISYS requires royalties
for its use. Nonetheless, both GIF and TIFF, two of the three most
common formats, use it.</p><p>Run length encoding (RLE) is the most common scheme and the
least effective. It is, however, very fast compared to other
compression algorithms. Its basic mechanism is very simple: when a
string of pixels with the same value is encountered, RLE outputs
the pixel value and the number of consecutive pixels with that
value. Complex images do not compress well with this scheme,
although monochrome images often compress very well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d00580.0x1df8c90"></a>Structure</h2></div></div><p>Simple formats consist of nothing more than the image data
and a short header giving the minimum amount of information
necessary to display the image: size and number of colors. More
robust formats often employ a tag or chunk structure. After an
initial header, the image is stored in a series of chunks, each
prefixed by a code telling the decoding software what the chunk
contains. The biggest chunk is the actual image data. Other chunks
may include comment blocks, palette information, or other special
image information. Software may only support some chunks of a given
format: if an unknown chunk is encountered, it is simply
skipped.</p><p>Finally, three special features bear closer examination:
magic numbers for format identification, gamma correction, and
alpha transparency masks. In some cases it is possible to identify
the format of a file by looking at the file itself. Many formats
use magic numbers&mdash;special (unique, it is hoped!) codes&mdash;to
identify the format. GIF files, for example, have &rdquo;GIF87a&rdquo; or
&ldquo;GIF89a&rdquo; at the start of the file. Because these magic numbers
are ASCII coded, using <span   class="bold"><b>less</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>strings</b></span> or even
<span   class="bold"><b>cat</b></span> (though that can accidentally
   change your character set) to display them on the screen is good
enough for identifying them. For example, to look for GIF files,
you can use <b  >strings <i><tt>filename</tt></i> |
grep GIF</b>.</p><p>Gamma correction is an important part of the proper display
of an image. Whenever an image is displayed on a monitor, the
monitor's characteristics affect the image. How the monitor handles
varying degrees of brightness is especially important. In general,
the brightness on the screen is related to the brightness levels of
the original image by a simple formula: screen brightness equals
image brightness raised to the gamma power. The value of gamma for
most monitors is around 2.5. To compensate for this, image capture
hardware and software may make an &ldquo;opposite&rdquo; operation on the
image. The result is an image with a gamma of 0.45. When this image
is displayed, the gamma of 0.45 and 2.5 cancel each other out,
producing an apparent gamma of about 1 (called linear brightness
scale).</p><p>But what does gamma mean visually? An image displayed with a
gamma less than one uses more of its pixel codes in the darker
areas, that is, darker areas have better color resolution. A gamma
value greater than one uses more of its pixel codes in the lighter
regions. A murky image, or an image with too much contrast, may
need to have its gamma corrected. Correcting the gamma of an image
is inherently lossy because of round-off error during the taking of
powers; hence, gamma correction should be performed when the image
is displayed, keeping the original image file intact without
loss.</p><p>Alpha transparency masks are a way of hiding, or masking,
parts of an image. In addition to image data, a value is included
in the image file for every pixel. A value of 2bitdepth-1 is opaque
and the pixel is displayed normally. A value of 0 is transparent,
allowing the background color of the screen to show through&mdash;the
image is not visible at all. The simplest application is to make a
non-rectangular image. Define an array the size of the image and
then draw a line between two opposite corners. Set the value of
each point above the line to one, and the values below to zero. The
result will be a triangular image.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d00580.0x1df90b0"></a>The Formats</h2></div></div><p>BMP</p><p>BMP is the native bitmapped format used by Microsoft Windows.
It is a minimal format that has few features and uses simple run
length encoding for data compression. With the widespread use of
Windows, BMP is the most common format. In many ways BMP is very
similar to the PCX format, and has assumed the role that PCX once
held.</p><p>BMP encodes 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 bit images. OS/2 uses a
similar BMP format, the only difference being a slightly simpler
header. The first two characters of the BMP header are always
&ldquo;BM&rdquo;.</p><p>WMF</p><p>Another format native to Microsoft Windows is the Windows
MetaFile (WMF). WMF uses Windows' Graphical Device Interface (GDI)
function calls to store images that appear repeatedly in
applications. The GDI calls provide support for setting up the
screen, defining regions, colors, text, pixels, lines, polygons and
bitmaps. WMF supports uncompressed monochrome, color palette, and
true color images.</p><p>GIF</p><p>The Graphics Interchange Format (pronounced &ldquo;jiff&rdquo;) was
originally developed by the Compuserve Information Service as a
color replacement for the earlier RLE format. Since the 1987
release, GIF has become the standard for graphics interchange,
especially on networks. A second release in 1989 added several new
features to the format. GIF is a lossless format based on the LZW
compression scheme. It uses a tag system to identify extension
blocks in the file, although only a few tags have been defined. The
biggest assets of the format are its relative simplicity, excellent
compression, and widespread availability.</p><p>However, the format has two major drawbacks. First, it is
based on a copyrighted compression scheme and commercial software
using it must pay royalties to Unisys, the patent holder. Second,
GIF can be used only for images with 256 or fewer colors. (Strictly
speaking, that is. Since GIF supports local color maps, the palette
can be changed in the middle of an image allowing for more than 256
colors. Unfortunately, much of the available software does not
support, or supports poorly, this feature, and it is, at best,
clumsy to use.) GIF files can be identified by the string
<b  >GIF87a</b> or <b  >GIF89a</b> at the start
of the file.</p><p>JPEG/JFIF</p><p>JPEG (pronounced &ldquo;jay-peg&rdquo;) is a standard for lossy
compression of images. JPEG achieves compression by breaking the
image into 8x8 boxes of pixels, performing a mathematical operation
called a cosine transform on each, and throwing out the high
frequency/small detail components; the more components thrown out,
the greater the compression and the poorer the image quality. The
remaining frequency components are then run length encoded and
compressed with the Huffman algorithm. To view an image, a JPEG
file must be uncompressed, decoded, and an inverse cosine transform
performed. This three-step process makes displaying JPEGs very
slow. Fortunately, JPEG produces excellent compression with little
or no visible image loss.</p><p>JPEG itself is not actually an image format but a set of
standards for compressing image data. JFIF, the JPEG File
Interchange Format, is the format commonly referred to as JPEG.
JFIF does not support all of the features of JPEG, but is intended
as a minimal implementation for image transfer. A full featured
implementation of JPEG is included in version 6.0 of the TIFF
format. Designers hope the two implementations of JPEG, one minimal
and one full featured, will deter software vendors from defining
proprietary formats based on JPEG (early Macintosh versions were
especially notorious for incompatibilities).</p><p>JPEG works best on real world images; line drawings and
cartoons will not compress nearly as well as scanned images. Unlike
most other formats, JPEG does not store a pixel as red, green, and
blue values. Instead it uses a format called YCbCr. Since most
display hardware uses RGB values, the YCbCr values must be
converted&mdash;yet another step slowing decompression. The JFIF header
includes the ASCII characters &ldquo;JFIF&rdquo; for format
identification.</p><p>PBM/PGM/PPM</p><p>These three formats are intermediate formats used by the
PBMPLUS utilities. The acronyms stand for Portable
BitMap/GrayMap/PixMap. PBM is for monochrome images, PGM for
grayscale images with up to 256 shades of gray, and PPM for color
images using up to 24-bits of true color. A fourth &ldquo;format&rdquo; is
the Portable AnyMap, PNM. PNM is not actually a format itself. A
program that uses PNM can read and write PBM, PGM, and PPM files.
PNM is used for utility programs that support multiple image types.
For instance, since the image type of a TIFF file may not be known,
PNM reads the TIFF file and writes the appropriate file
type.</p><p>Each of the four formats can read the other ones that carry
less information. That is, a PGM utility reads PGM and PBM, a PPM
utility reads PPM, PGM, and PBM. PBM, PGM, and PPM utilities always
write in their own format, while PNM utilities generally write
whatever format they have read. The formats store data either as
ASCII or binary data and are otherwise basic formats consisting of
a header and image data. The header consists of a magic number to
identify the format, image size, and (except for PBM) the number of
colors/gray shades. The magic strings are <b  >PBM
P1(P4)</b>, <b  >PGM P2(P5)</b>, and <b  >PPM
P3(P6)</b>, where the first code is the code for ASCII data,
and the code in parentheses is for binary data. True color images
store pixel data as a triplet of numbers for RGB data. For more
information on the PBMPLUS package, see the section on software
below.</p><p>PCX</p><p>The PCX format is the native format of Z-Soft's PC Paintbrush
program and uses run length encoding. As one of the first general
purpose formats, its use has been very widespread: few programs
exist that do not recognize it. PCX is a basic format consisting of
a 128 byte header followed by image data. Monochrome as well as 4,
8, and 24-bit color images are supported. The palette for 4-bit
images is included in the header while the 8-bit palette is
appended after the image data. This non-uniformity is the result of
an older format being updated for newer hardware. For this reason,
the use of PCX has dwindled in favor of the more coherent and
unified BMP.</p><p>PNG</p><p>Amazingly, with all the other formats available, there has
been an important niche left unfilled: a portable, relatively
simple, free standard for the lossless exchange of true color
images&mdash;in short, a 24-bit version of GIF with a non-patented
compression algorithm. There are existing formats that can be used,
but only TIFF has the necessary features, and it suffers from
over-completeness: very few implementations make use of the entire
TIFF specification. What is needed is a format that is simple
enough that any image saved under it can be read by any viewer
supporting it.</p><p>Compuserve called their development specification GIF24, but
when a group of Internet graphics experts developed PNG (Portable
Network Graphics, pronounced &ldquo;ping&rdquo;), Compuserve adopted it as
the successor to GIF. PNG is a natural extension to GIF, although
it is not backwards compatible because of a change in compression
scheme. In addition to the original GIF features, PNG supports true
color images up to 48 bits and grayscale images to 16 bits, as well
as full alpha-channel, gamma correction, and detection of file
corruption. On 8 bit and larger data, PNG can use a preprocessor on
the image data prior to compressing. In many cases this processing
improves the compression efficiency and results in smaller file
sizes. Expect to see PNG files appearing at an archive near you
soon.</p><p>PS/EPS</p><p>PostScript (PS) is a page description language developed by
Adobe Systems that is both a descriptive and raster format and has
become one of the most common printer languages. PostScript files
are created by many application programs as a device-independent
output format. Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) is a limited version
of postscript for single pictures and is used for images to be
included, or &ldquo;encapsulated&rdquo;, in programs or postscript files. The
first line of a postscript file is a line of the form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
%!PS-Adobe-3.0
</pre><p>where the number refers to the PostScript version the file
was created under. EPS files append <b  >EPSF-3.0</b> to
this line. PostScript is a large and versatile language. Display
PostScript is an implementation of PostScript for controlling video
hardware and is used by NeXT computers and software.</p><p>TGA</p><p>The Targa Truevision graphics format was developed for use in
Truevision's product line. TGA uses run length encoding to store
grayscale, color table, and true color images, and can include
comments, gamma, alpha, color corrections, and a &ldquo;postage stamp&rdquo;
version of the image. TGA was one of the first true color formats
and is still used by some applications like the Persistence of
Vision Ray Tracer. TGA files may contain a block at the end of the
file that includes the text
<b  >TRUEVISION-XFILE</b>.</p><p>TIFF</p><p>The Tag Image File Format is the most robust format. As its
name suggests, TIFF makes liberal use of the tag concept. TIFF
files are typically read using random access because the tag fields
can come in any order; an image file directory provides offsets to
the location of data in the file. (Even the directory can be
anywhere in the file! A short header gives the directory location
in the file.) The TIFF format defines several classes of image
data: bilevel (monochrome), 4 to 8-bit grayscale or color palette,
24-bit RGB, and 24-bit YCbCr. It supports run length, Huffman, LZW,
and JPEG compression. Most implementations do not support all TIFF
features, making TIFF a potentially aggravating format. However,
TIFF has a huge number of features (implemented in tags) making it
unique. Originally intended for desktop publishing, TIFF has spread
to video, fax, and document storage, as well as medical and
scientific imaging. Because of its complexity, it is not commonly
used for home applications.</p><p>XBM/XPM</p><p>X-Windows defines several formats for internal use. X Bitmap
(XBM) is an ASCII format for including 1 bit images in the C source
of a program: XBM images are integral to the code and included at
compile time, not run time. XBM data is usually included in header
files and includes two define statements for the width and height
of the image followed by a static unsigned character array. XBM
images are often used for icons and cursor bitmaps in X. X Pixmap
(XPM) is the equivalent format for color palette images. Its use is
identical to XBM except for the addition of the color table and
three extra define statements for version number, color table
length, and the number of bytes per pixel. X does define a general
format for images, the X Window Dump (XWD or WD) format. XWD
supports uncompressed raster data of all types.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d00580.0x21f2068"></a>Programs and Libraries</h2></div></div><p>Having looked at some of the common graphics formats, we
finish up with a quick look at some available programs and
libraries for converting images.</p><p>xv and ImageMagick</p><p>These two X programs display, convert, and manipulate images.
<span   class="bold"><b>xv</b></span> can read and write JPEG, GIF,
TIFF, PBM/PGM/PPM, and X formats, although it cannot display 24bit
images as 24bit. In addition to format conversions, xv can perform
simple image manipulations, e.g., rotate, flip, crop, magnify, and
gamma correction. ImageMagick supports the formats xv does, plus
TGA. It can send output directly to a postscript printer and has
more image manipulation capabilities than xv: cut, copy, paste,
resize, flip, flop, rotate, invert, emboss, and more, on the whole
or on part of the image.</p><p>ghostscript</p><p>The canonical way to view and convert from PostScript
(including EPS) is ghostscript. Ghostscript operates both from the
command line options and interactively. Input is always a
PostScript file and output may be any of several different file
formats, printer languages, or screen types. By default,
ghostscript sends its output to an X terminal, but it can also save
images to file. Ghostview is a popular front end for ghostscript
that improves the screen handling.</p><p>PBMPLUS</p><p>The PBMPLUS utilities are a set of 120 programs for image
conversion and manipulation. PBMPLUS defines three intermediate
formats: PBM, PGM, and PPM (see listing above). The basic
philosophy is that if there are twenty formats, you need twenty
squared, or 400, programs/subroutines to convert between them. The
use of intermediate formats reduces that number to two times
twenty, or forty. In addition to the conversion programs, there are
a number of simple image processing programs: scaling, rotating,
smoothing, convolution, gamma, cropping and more. NETPLUS is a
newer version of PBMPLUS, but some versions suffer from serious
bugs.</p><p>C Library support</p><p>Substantial support exists for C programmers working with
graphics. Libraries for JPEG/JFIF, TIFF, and PNG are now available.
In addition, code fragments for many of the other formats are
readily available from Internet archive sites.</p><p>IJG JPEG/JFIF library</p><p>The easiest way to do JPEG programming is to use the
Independent JPEG Group's (IJG) library. This library is based on
the JFIF specification and includes two common programs found on
many Unix systems for storage and retrieval of JFIF images: cjpeg
and djpeg. The library is available as source and compiled
code.</p><p>SGI TIFF library</p><p>Like the JPEG library, a full set of routines to implement
TIFF is available. Written by Sam Leffler and SGI, this library is
also available as source and compiled code. The library includes
programs for converting, dithering, splitting, and displaying
information on TIFF files.</p><p>PNG toolbox</p><p>With the recent announcement of support for the PNG format,
Compuserve also announced a PNG toolbox. The toolbox uses the zlib
library for the LZ77 code and is intended to speed the acceptance
of the new format. Its use will be free of royalties. A beta
version is available on Compuserve.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d00580.0x21f2698"></a>Graphics Resources</h2></div></div><p>There are several archive sites on the Internet where
