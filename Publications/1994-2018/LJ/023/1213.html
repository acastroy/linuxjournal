    In this month's column, Eric moves beyond find to
    cover duplicating files and directory trees using the
    versatile cpio command. cpio uses space on tape more
    efficiently than tar and is an excellent alternative
    for creating archives on platforms that do not have the GNU
    utilities available. Read on for a thorough discussion of
    cpio and its three modes of operation: Pass-through, Create
    and Extract.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d4580.0x23cc500"></a></h2></div></div><p>In an earlier article, I suggested using
the following command for duplicating files and directory trees:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -depth | cpio -pdmv <span   class="emphasis"><em>dest_dir</em></span>
</pre><p>Since the focus of that tutorial was the
<span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span> utility, I didn't discuss
<span   class="bold"><b>cpio</b></span> in depth.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>cpio</b></span> can create and extract
archives on diskette, tape or in files using eight different
archive formats, including tar. It can also create an almost
perfect duplicate of a directory tree, preserving file ownership,
modes, and access times. Since cpio is designed to accept a list of
files such as the output of ls or
<span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span>, it is more suited for
comprehensive backup systems than tools like conventional tar; the
set of files processed can be easily controlled
programmatically.</p><p>cpio also has some less obvious advantages. The default cpio
format uses the space on tape much more efficiently than the
conventional tar format, and it can also skip damaged sections of
archives and continue during restore operations, instead of
quitting completely.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>GNU tar</b></span>, which will be
covered in an upcoming tutorial, addresses many of these issues.
However, when creating archives for other platforms that do not
have the GNU utilities available, cpio is an excellent
alternative.</p><p>Two of the reasons why cpio is not used are readily apparent.
The list of possible command line switches fills nearly half a
typewritten page, and since it does not accept file names or
wildcards as arguments, novices can find it pretty intimidating.
But cpio can be worth the extra effort.</p><p>cpio has three modes of operation. Pass-through mode, which
is what I used in the example above for duplication, create mode,
which is used for creating archives, and extract mode, which is
used for extracting files from archives.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d4580.0x23cca80"></a>Pass-Through Mode</h2></div></div><p>As its name implies, in pass-through mode cpio acts as a
conduit for copying lists of files from one destination to another.
The ability to do this while creating subdirectories as needed and
handling special files makes it a crucial tool for any system
administrator to be familiar with.</p><p>For example, one common situation on a multi-user system is
the need for more drive space for user directories. The
administrator will need to perform the following steps: add an
additional drive to the system, create one or more file systems,
copy the user directories from the old file system to the new one,
and then, depending upon the circumstances, change the file system
mount points in order to make the transition unobtrusive.</p><p>There are three methods available for copying the users'
files over to the new disk. One is to use tar to archive the files
and extract them to the new area. This requires the time necessary
to archive and extract the files.</p><p>Another is to use <span   class="bold"><b>cp</b></span>'s
recursive mode to copy them directly. This mode copies only regular
files and links. It also follows symbolic links, which can
duplicate a lot of files when used carelessly.</p><p>Of course, few system administrators know exactly what is in
their users' directories. A developer may have special files such
as sockets or pipes. Any user may have files with special
permissions in order to prevent unwanted access. Administrators do
not have time to inspect home directories that carefully, and many
users do not want them to anyway.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -depth | cpio --pass-through \
 --preserve-modification-times \
 --make-directories --verbose /mnt/export
</pre><p>This command causes find to output the name of every file
under the present directory. (The -depth option insures that
directory names are output before the names of the files in them.)
cpio reads these file names in and copies them to
/mnt/export.</p><p>The switches passed to cpio are:</p><p><b  ><i><tt>--pass-through</tt></i></b>Operate
in pass-through mode.</p><p><b  ><i><tt>--preserve-modification-times</tt></i></b>Set
the modification times of the new files to that of the old
ones.</p><p><b  ><i><tt>--make-directories</tt></i></b>Create
directories when necessary. (This option works when restoring
archives, also.)</p><p><b  ><i><tt>--verbose</tt></i></b>Verbose
mode. This mode will produce output for all files. An alternative
is the <b  >-dot</b> option which only produces a
<b  ><i><tt>.</tt></i></b> for each file
processed. (These options work in all modes.)</p><p>The command above creates an exact duplicate of the original
directory, regardless of the types of files or any special file
modes that were set.</p><p>If the files are being copied to the same file system, the
<b  >--link</b> option can be used to hard link files
when necessary.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d4580.0x23cd478"></a>Create Mode</h2></div></div><p>Create mode creates archive files. (This is also referred to
as &ldquo;copy-out&rdquo; mode.) cpio accepts a list of file names, just as
it does in pass-through mode. But instead of creating duplicate
files in another area, it creates an archive and sends it to
standard output.</p><p>Since it is sent to standard output, the archive can be
redirected to any device or file such as a tape, diskette, or
standard file.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find -depth /export/home \
    | cpio --create &gt; /dev/fd0
</pre><p>This creates an archive of the /export/home directory tree on
the floppy drive at /dev/fd0. Of course, the /export/home area
probably won't fit on one floppy, but cpio prompts for another
device or file name when each floppy is filled, so it can be
replaced, and the user can type the device name again. (Note that
<span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span>'s -depth switch is still
recommended to prevent possible problems when the archive is
extracted.)</p><p>When it comes to creating archives, cpio has many options.
One of the most important is the format of the archive.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>bin</b></span>(default) the binary
format encodes files in a non-portable method. Therefore, it is not
suited for exchanging files between Linux on a PC and Linux on
other architectures such as Alpha or Power PC.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>odc</b></span>old (POSIX.1) portable
format. This is portable across platforms, but is not suited for
file systems with more than 65536 inodes, which means most of
today's larger hard disks.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>newc</b></span>new portable format.
This is portable across platforms, and has no inherent limit on
number of inodes.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>crc</b></span>new portable format, with
a checksum added.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span>compatible with tar, but
only supports file names up to 100 characters.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ustar</b></span>new tar format.
Supports up to 255 character file names.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>hpbin</b></span>non-portable format
used by HP/UX.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>hpodc</b></span>&ldquo;portable&rdquo; format
used by HP/UX. Stores device files differently.</p><p>The archive format is specified with the --format
switch.</p><p>Out of all the formats, the crc format is probably the best,
since it is portable and has an extra degree of error checking via
the checksum.</p><p>A better method for creating an archive would be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find /export/home -depth | cpio --create \
  --message="Insert next disk and type /dev/fd0 " \
  --format=crc &gt; /dev/fd0
</pre><p>This uses the crc format for the archive and prompts the user
with <b  >Insert next disk and type /dev/fd0</b> as each
floppy is filled. The <b  >--message</b> option, which
works in both create and extract mode, replaces the default
message.</p><p>There are many other options available for the creation of
archives, which I will cover later.</p><p>Even though GNU tar does have many of the advantages of cpio,
the ability to use find to specify the files to be backed up
provides much more flexibility than shell wildcards. [You can do
this with tar, too, but you have to send the output of find into a
file and use that file as an &ldquo;include file&rdquo; for tar&mdash;ED]</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d4580.0x27c6220"></a>Extract Mode</h2></div></div><p>Extract mode (also referred to as &ldquo;copy-in&rdquo; mode) extracts
files from archives. This mode is inconsistent with the other two,
since file names are specified on the command line, instead of via
a list on standard input.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cpio --extract &lt; /dev/fd0
</pre><p>This command restores all of the files from the archive in
/dev/fd0, since no file names were specified. If the archive spans
more than one volume, cpio will prompt for each volume the same way
it does when archives are created. The --message option can be
used to override the default message, as in create mode.</p><p>cpio automatically recognizes archive formats during
extraction, so it is not necessary to specify them on the command
line.</p><p>The path passed to cpio by find is stored in the archive.
Therefore it is important to pay attention to how find is
used.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -depth | cpio --create &gt; /tmp/archive
</pre><p>This creates an archive that extracts into the present
working directory.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find /export/home -depth | cpio --create \
    &gt; /tmp/archive
</pre><p>This creates an archive that will try to extract to
/export/home, regardless of the circumstances. If the
<b  >-d</b> option is specified the directory is created
if it does not already exist. (If /export/home does not exist and
<b  >-d</b> is omitted, the extraction will fail.)</p><p>Anything specified on the command line that is not an option
is treated as a filename pattern.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cpio --extract "back" &lt; /dev/fd0
</pre><p>This will extract files in the archive that have
<b  >back</b> in their name. No other files will be
restored. Multiple patterns can also be specified.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cpio --extract "back" "save" &lt; /dev/fd0
</pre><p>This will extract files with &ldquo;back&rdquo; or &ldquo;save&rdquo; in their
names.</p><p>In addition to providing patterns on the command line, they
can be provided as lines in a file. The file is specified with the
<b  >--pattern-file=<i><tt>filename</tt></i></b>
option. This provides a lot of flexibility in restoring files,
since the actual path does not have to be known and wildcards are
not needed. Frequently restored patterns can be stored in a
file.</p><p>The <b  >--nonmatching</b> option is used to
specify files not to extract.</p><p>It may help to see the contents of the archive before
extracting anything from it.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cpio --list &lt; /dev/fd0
</pre><p>The <b  >--list</b> option lists the contents of
the archive. The option <b  >--numeric-uid-gid</b> forces
the list to show user and group IDs numerically, instead of trying
to resolve the names with the passwd and group files.</p><p>Instead of standard input and output the archive can be sent
to (or extracted from) a file.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find /export/home -depth | cpio --create \
  --file=/vol/archive
</pre><p>This option works either for creating or extracting archives.
To use a remote tape drive specify the hostname and user name
before the filename. (The user must have access to the remote host
without a password. This can be done by using the file
.rhosts)</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find /export/home -depth | cpio --create \
  --file=eric@bajor:/dev/rmt0
</pre><p>One of the key advantages of creating archives with this
option is that disk files (archives not on tape or floppy) created
with this option can be appended to with the
<b  >--append</b> option.</p><p>This command will work if eric has no password, (not
recommended) or if the host that the command is run on is listed in
the .rhosts file in eric's home directory.</p><p>When restoring an archive it is sometimes desirable to not
alter the file modification times:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find /export/home -depth | cpio --extract \
  --preserve-modification-times --file
/vol/archive
</pre><p>The <b  >--preserve-modification-times</b> option
works in extract mode in addition to pass through mode.</p><p>In addition to preserving modification times, the access
times for archived or copy files can be preserved so that the cpio
operation does not affect the original files:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -depth | cpio --pass-through \
 --make-directories --preserve-modification-times \
 --reset-access-time /vol/copy
</pre><p>This will copy the current directory to /vol/copy while
copying the modification times on the old files to the new and also
leaving the access times on the original files untouched.</p><p>The default action for cpio, when operating in copy-in
(extract) or pass-through mode, is to prompt a user for
confirmation before writing over existing files, if the existing
file is newer. By default, cpio will not replace the existing
files. The <b  >--unconditional</b> option overrides that
behavior:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cpio --extract --unconditional "back" "save" \
  &lt; /dev/fd0
</pre><p>The <b  >--dereference</b> option copies the file
pointed to by a symbolic link, instead of the link itself, in
archive creation and pass-through mode.</p><p>The <b  >--rename</b> command will prompt the user
to interactively rename each file. This only works in extract
mode.</p><p>When acting as a system administrator, it is sometimes useful
to restore an archive or duplicate a directory and change the user
or group id of the target in the process.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cpio --extract --owner=eric.staff &lt; /dev/fd0
</pre><p>This will restore the archive on /dev/fd0 and set the owner
of all the extracted files to eric and the group to staff. Only
root may use this option. If the group is left out, it will not be
changed unless the <b  ><i><tt>.</tt></i></b>
is included, in which case the group will be set to the user's
login group.</p><p>Another option related to file ownership is
<b  >--no-preserve-owner</b>. This is the default
behavior for non-root users. Files will belong to the user copying
or extracting them, instead of the original user. For root the
default is to preserve ownership.</p><p>There are also advanced options related to transferring data
between big-endian and little-endian architectures and for
controlling I/O buffer sizes to optimize performance.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d4580.0x27c7610"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>The cpio command may seem cryptic at first glance, but after
you use it a few times, it will become an indispensable addition to
your Linux toolkit. Especially if you are one of the many users
with no tape drive and no commercial backup utility, learning cpio
and swapping floppies sure beats the (non-existent) alternative
after a disk crashes or you make a mistake with the rm
command...</p></div></div>
