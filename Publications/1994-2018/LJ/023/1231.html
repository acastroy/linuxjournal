(December '95 pg. 34): <span   class="emphasis"><em>Caldera Network
Desktop</em></span>.</p><p>I agree with Roger Scrafford &ldquo;It's slick...&rdquo; etc., but if
Caldera could separate the commercial stuff from the free parts
they would be playing more on the &ldquo;team of FSF and Linux&rdquo;.</p><p>I would be willing to pay for products like the full-blown
CRiSP editor (Yes I love it, being a Brief user way back) or
WordPerfect 6.1 with HTML.</p><p>But a student or hacker could download the Caldera Desktop
for free.</p><p>As Linus Torvalds says (and I fully agree): &ldquo;...the future
is the desktop...&rdquo;---meaning that what Caldera is doing for Linux
is very important.</p><p>With this separated distribution method, maybe the Caldera
Desktop could be a big success (like Netscape?).</p><p>Kindly,</p><p>O.J. -&gt; Ole J. Utnes
(<a href="mailto:Ole.J.Utnes@hive.no">Ole.J.Utnes@hive.no</a>)</p><p>P.S. Keep up the good work with
<i  >LJ</i>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x248f580.0x25875b0"></a>They Do!</h2></div></div><p>To answer your first point: Caldera does separate them, very
carefully. It makes it very clear in the manual which parts are
free, and which are commercial, and makes it clear that you can
install only the free parts on as many machines as you wish.</p><p>The desktop application is one of the commercial pieces they
licensed from someone else, just like the font server, backup.unet,
and the NetWare connectivity tools.</p><p>However, the Caldera Network Desktop is based on Red Hat
Commercial Linux, and all the free pieces of CND are in Red Hat,
which <span   class="bold"><b>is</b></span> available for FTP from
many sites on the internet, including ftp.caldera.com, so your wish
is granted.</p><p>That is, your wish is granted unless you specifically want
them to give away their desktop application. Linus wasn't talking
about a desktop metaphor like Looking Glass when he said that the
future is in the desktop. He was talking about machines that sit on
the desktop, as opposed to servers that live in a &ldquo;glass house&rdquo;
and are administered by all-knowing gurus.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x248f580.0x2587818"></a>Index Wishes</h2></div></div><p>I think the index should:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Quietly appear in every December issue.</p></li><li><p>Be printed on the last pages of the issue (like in
science journals).</p></li></ul></div><p>And, by the way, I think my father's TeX'ed index is better.
But that's my own biased opinion. I think he e-mailed you about it
just because you printed yours...</p><p>Peter Galbraith, research

appear in every December issue, covering the previous year.</p><p>It will probably not be printed on the last pages of the
issue. We've sold that advertising space, and we can't just take it
back for a month.</p><p>Your father's index is different&mdash;it's more like the index
to a book; ours is more like an extended table of contents. We may
end up providing his index via the WWW and/or FTP.</p><p>You might also check out our index on our WWW site
(<a href="http://www.ssc.com" target="_self">http://www.ssc.com/</a>). When
we have all our articles on-line, that should be capable of a
full-text search; it's currently capable of a keyword
search.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x248f580.0x2587e48"></a>More Questions</h2></div></div><p>First I said: &ldquo;Oh, a possibly boring issue...&rdquo; from the
titles on the cover. But no! You had a really good article on
<span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span>, and I knew I'd learn
something in that Linux System Administration article on adding a
new disk.</p><p>One question to all of you: The
<span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span> article uses
<span   class="bold"><b>cpio</b></span> to copy a directory tree and
the Administration article uses
<span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span>. I typically use:</p><p><b  >tar cf -&gt; ./ | (cd TARGET_DIRECTORY; tar xvf
-&gt;)</b></p><p>so I learned about the <b  >-&gt;C DIRECTORY</b>
<span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> option from Aileen's article.
But should I be using <span   class="bold"><b>cpio</b></span>? What's
best?</p><p>Also, a note on &ldquo;Hints for splitting Linux across two
disks&rdquo;. I use her method of moving directories and pointing soft
links to them as a last resort. Isn't it better to mount the second
disk under /usr (or something) to begin with and then safely fully
install Linux? Then at least everything is where is should be with
a minimum of (sometimes confusing) links on the system.</p><p>Thanks for another good issue,</p><p>Peter Galbraith</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x248f580.0x2588420"></a>It's a Matter of Taste</h2></div></div><p>Most people prefer <span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span>
because it is a little easier to learn how to use, for most people.
When <span   class="bold"><b>cpio</b></span> needs to create a
directory that isn't explicitly included in the archive, it does it
with 700 permissions, whereas <span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span>
uses 755. 755 is arguably more useful in most circumstances. Some
people simply prefer <span   class="bold"><b>cpio</b></span>'s
interface (see Eric's article on page 44).
<span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>cpio</b></span> are often thought of
together; in fact, SVR4 find has a <b  >-&gt;cpio</b>
option that can be used as an action to add files to a
<span   class="bold"><b>cpio</b></span> archive. I understand that
some versions of <span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> have not
properly preserved hard links, but I've just tested to make sure
that GNU <span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> does preserve hard
links correctly.</p><p>In general, most of the advantages of each archiver have been
added to the other over time, so it's a matter of taste.</p><p>Eric Goebelbecker replied, in response to the second
point:</p><p>&ldquo;I would move the software over and soft link it myself for
one reason: I did it, and know what I did. Come upgrade time, that
knowledge becomes real valuable...&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x248f580.0x25889a0"></a>S.u.S.E. Linux</h2></div></div><p>Dear Editor,</p><p>I would like to commend the folks at S.u.S.E. in Germany for
being generous enough to give something back to those from whom
they have gained.</p><p>It is their practice to offer a free copy of their
distribution to the authors of free software that they include. As
the maintainer of GNU awk, I recently received my second
distribution from them, and I felt that the Linux community ought
to be aware of this company's fine practice.</p><p>Arnold
