    This is the first in a series of four articles co-authored
    by Alessandro Rubini and Georg Zezchwitz which present a
    practical approach to writing Linux device drivers as kernel
    loadable modules. This installment presents and introduction
    to thte topic, preparing the reader to understand next
    month's installment.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a53580.0x1b4b558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Kernel modules are a great feature of
recent Linux kernels. Although most users feel modules are only a
way to free some memory by keeping the floppy driver out of the
kernel most of the time, the real benefit of using modules is
support for adding additional devices without patching the kernel
source. In the next few Kernel Korners Georg Zezschwitz and I will
try to introduce the &ldquo;art&rdquo; of writing a powerful module&mdash;while
avoiding common design errors.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a53580.0x1b4b660"></a>What is a device?</h2></div></div><p>A device driver is the lowest level of the software that runs
on a computer, as it is directly bound to the hardware features of
the device.</p><p>The concept of &ldquo;device driver&rdquo; is quite abstract, actually,
and the kernel can be considered like it was a big device driver
for a device called &ldquo;computer&rdquo;. Usually, however, you don't
consider your computer a monolithic entity, but rather a CPU
equipped with peripherals. The kernel can thus be considered as an
application running on top of the device drivers: each driver
manages a single part of the computer, while the kernel-proper
builds process scheduling and file-system access on top of the
available devices.</p><p><a href="1219f1.html" target="_self">See Figure 1.</a></p><p>A few mandatory drivers are &ldquo;hardwired&rdquo; in the kernel, such
as the processor driver and the the memory driver; the others are
optional, and the computer is usable both with and without
them&mdash;although a kernel with neither the console driver nor the
network driver is pointless for a conventional user.</p><p>The description above is somehow a simplistic one, and
slightly philosophical too. Real drivers interact in a complex way
and a clean distinction among them is sometimes difficult to
achieve.</p><p>In the Unix world things like the network driver and a few
other complex drivers belong to the kernel, and the name of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>device driver</em></span> is reserved to the low-level
software interface to devices belonging to the following three
groups:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">character devices</span></dt><dd><p>Those which can be considered files, in that they
can be read-from and/or written-to. The console (i.e. monitor and
keyboard) and the serial/parallel ports are examples of character
devices. Files like /dev/tty0 and /dev/cua0 provide user access to
the device. A char device usually can only be accessed
sequentially.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">block devices</span></dt><dd><p>Historically: devices which can be read and written
only in multiples of the block-size, often 512 or 1024 bytes. These
are devices on which you can mount a filesystem, most notably
disks. Files like /dev/hda1 provide access to the devices. Blocks
of block devices are cached by the <span   class="bold"><b>buffer
cache</b></span>. Unix provides uncached character devices
corresponding to block devices, but Linux does not.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">network interfaces</span></dt><dd><p>Network interfaces don't fall in the device-file
abstraction. Network interfaces are identified by means of a name
(such as eth0 or plip1) but they are not mapped to the filesystem.
It would be theoretically possible, but it is impractical from a
programming and performance standpoint; a network interface can
only transfer packets, and the file abstraction does not
efficiently manage structured data like packets.</p></dd></dl></div><p>The description above is rather sketchy, and each flavour of
Unix differs in some details about what is a block device. It
doesn't make too much a difference, actually, because the
distinction is only relevant inside the kernel, and we aren't going
to talk about block drivers in detail.</p><p>What is missing in the previous representation is that the
kernel also acts as a library for device drivers; drivers request
services from the kernel. Your module will be able to call
functions to perform memory allocation, filesystem access, and so
on.</p><p>As far as loadable modules are concerned, any of the three
driver-types can be constructed as a module. You can also build
modules to implement filesystems, but this is outside of our
scope.</p><p>These columns will concentrate on character device drivers,
because special (or home-built) hardware fits the character device
abstraction most of the time. There are only a few differences
between the three types, and so to avoid confusion, we'll only
cover the most common type.</p><p>You can find an introduction to block drivers in issues 9,
10, and 11 of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, as well as in the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Kernel Hackers' Guide</em></span>. Although both are
slightly outdated, taken together with these columns, they should
give you enough information to get started.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a53580.0x1b4c108"></a>What is a module?</h2></div></div><p>A module is a code segment which registers itself with the
kernel as a device driver, is called by the kernel in order to
communicate with the device, and in turn invokes other kernel
functions to accomplish its tasks. Modules utilize a clean
interface between the &ldquo;kernel proper&rdquo; and the device, which both
makes the modules easy to write and keeps the kernel source code
from being cluttered.</p><p>The module must be compiled to object code (no linking; leave
the compiled code in .o files), and then loaded into the running
kernel with <span   class="bold"><b>insmod</b></span>. The insmod
program is a <span   class="bold"><b>runtime linker</b></span>, which
resolves any undefined symbols in the module to addresses in the
running kernel by means of the kernel symbol table.</p><p>This means that you can write a module much like a
conventional C-language program, and you can call functions you
don't define, in the same way you usually call
<b  >printf()</b> and <b  >fopen()</b> in your
application. However, you can count only on a minimal set of
external functions, which are the <span   class="emphasis"><em>public</em></span>
functions provided by the kernel.
<span   class="bold"><b>insmod</b></span> will put the right
kernel-space addresses in your compiled module wherever your code
calls a kernel function, then insert the module into the running
Linux kernel.</p><p>If you are in doubt whether a kernel-function is public or
not, you can look for its name either in the source file
/usr/src/linux/kernel/ksyms.c or in the run-time table
/proc/ksyms.</p><p>To use make to compile your module, you'll need a Makefile as
simple as the following one:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

TARGET = <span   class="emphasis"><em>myname</em></span>

ifdef DEBUG
  # -O is needed, because of "extern inline"
  # Add -g if your gdp is patched and can use it
  CFLAGS = -O -DDEBUG_$(TARGET) -D__KERNEL__ -Wall
else
  CFLAGS = -O3 -D__KERNEL__ -fomit-frame-pointer
endif

all: $(TARGET).o
</pre><p>As you see, no special rule is needed to build a module, only
the correct value for <b  >CFLAGS</b>. I recommend that
you include debugging support in your code, because without
patches, gdb isn't able to take advantage of the symbol information
provided by the <b  >-g</b> flag to a module while it is
part of the running kernel.</p><p>Debugging support will usually mean extra code to print
messages from within the driver. Using <b  >printk()</b>
for debugging is powerful, and the alternatives are running a
debugger on the kernel, peeking in /dev/mem, and other extremely
low-level techniques. There are a few tools available on the
Internet to help use these other techniques, but you need to be
conversant with gdb and be able to read real kernel code in order
to benefit from them. The most interesting tool at time of writing
is kdebug-1.1, which lets you use gdb on a running kernel,
examining or even changing kernel data structures (including those
in loaded kernel modules) while the kernel is running.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Kdebug</em></span> is available for ftp from
sunsite.unc.edu and its mirrors under /pub/Linux/kernel.</p><p>Just to make things a little harder, the kernel equivalent of
the standard <b  >printf()</b> function is called
<b  >printk()</b>, because it does not work exactly the
same as <b  >printf()</b>. Before 1.3.37, conventional
<b  >printk()</b>'s generated lines in
<b  >/var/adm/messages</b>, while later kernels will dump
them to the console. If you want quiet logging (only within the
messages file, via syslogd) you must prepend the symbol
<b  >KERN_DEBUG</b> to the format string.
<b  >KERN_DEBUG</b> and similar symbols are simply
strings, which get concatenated to your format string by the
compiler. This means that you must <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> put a
comma between <b  >KERN_DEBUG</b> and the format string.
These symbols can be found in
<b  >&lt;linux/kernel.h&gt;</b>, and are documented
there. Also, <b  >printk()</b> does not support floating
point formats.</p><p>Remember, that syslog write to the messages file as soon as
possible, in order to save all messages on disk in case of a system
crash. This means that an over-printk-ed module will slow down
perceptibly, and will fill your disk in a short time.</p><p>Almost any module misbehaviour will generate an [cw]Oops[ecw]
message from the kernel. An <b  >Oops</b> is what happens
when the kernel gets an exception from kernel code. In other words,
<b  >Oops</b>es are the equivalent of segmentation faults
in user space, though no core file is generated. The result is
usually the sudden destruction of the responsible process, and a
few lines of low-level information in the messages file. Most
<b  >Oops</b> messages are the result of dereferencing a
<b  >NULL</b> pointer.</p><p>This way to handle disasters is a friendly one, and you'll
enjoy it whenever your code is faulty: most other Unices produce a
kernel panic instead. This does not mean that Linux never panics.
You must be prepared to generate panics whenever you write
functions that operate outside of a process context, such as within
interrupt handlers and timer callbacks.</p><p>The scarce, nearly unintelligible information included with
the [cw]Oops[ecw] message represents the processor state when the
code faulted, and can be used to understand where the error is. A
tool called ksymoops is able to print more readable information out
of the oops, provided you have a kernel map handy. The map is what
is left in /usr/src/linux/System.map after a kernel compilation.
Ksymoops was distributed within util-linux-2.4, but was removed in
2.5 because it has been included in the kernel distribution during
the linux-1.3 development.</p><p>If you really understand the <b  >Oops</b> message,
you can use it as you want, like invoking gdb off-line to
disassemble the whole responsible function. if you understand
neither the <b  >Oops</b> nor the ksymoops output, you'd
better add some more debugging <b  >printk()</b> code,
recompile, and reproduce the bug.</p><p>The following code can ease management of debugging messages.
It must reside in the module's public include file, and will work
for both kernel code (the module) and user code (applications).
Note however that this code is gcc-specific. Not too big a problem
for a kernel module, which is gcc-dependent anyway. This code was
suggested by Linus Torvalds, as an enhancement over my previous
ansi-compliant approach.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

The simple answer is &ldquo;whatever you need&rdquo;. In practice, you must
remember that the module is kernel code, and must fit a
well-defined interface with the rest of Linux.</p><p>Usually, you start with header inclusion. And you begin to
have contraints: you must always define the
<b  >__KERNEL__</b> symbol before including any header
unless it is defined in your makefile, and you must
<span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> include files pertaining to the
<b  >&lt;linux/*&gt;</b> and
<b  >&lt;asm/*&gt;</b> hierarchies. Sure, you can include
your module-specific header, but never, ever, include library
specific files, such as <b  >&lt;stdio.h&gt;</b> or
<b  >&lt;sys/time.h&gt;</b>.</p><p>The code fragment in Listing 1 represents the first lines of
source of a typical character driver. If you are going to write a
module, it will be easier to cut and paste these lines from
existing source rather than copying them by hand from this
article.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#define __KERNEL__         /* kernel code */

#define MODULE             /* always as a module */
#include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;  /* can't do without it */
#include &lt;linux/version.h&gt; /* and this too */

/*
 * Then include whatever header you need.
 * Most likely you need the following:
 */
#include &lt;linux/types.h&gt;   /* ulong and friends */
#include &lt;linux/sched.h&gt;   /* current, task_struct, other goodies */
#include &lt;linux/fcntl.h&gt;   /* O_NONBLOCK etc. */
#include &lt;linux/errno.h&gt;   /* return values */
#include &lt;linux/ioport.h&gt;  /* request_region() */
#include &lt;linux/config.h&gt;  /* system name and global items */
#include &lt;linux/malloc.h&gt;  /* kmalloc, kfree */

#include &lt;asm/io.h&gt;        /* inb() inw() outb() ... */
#include &lt;asm/irq.h&gt;       /* unreadable, but useful */

#include "<span   class="emphasis"><em>modulename</em></span>.h" /* your own material */
</pre><p>After including the headers, there comes actual code. Before
talking about specific driver functionality&mdash;most of the code&mdash;it
is worth noting that there exist two module-specific functions,
which must be defined in order for the module to be loaded:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int init_module (void);
void cleanup_module (void);
</pre><p>The first is in charge of module initialization (looking for
the related hardware and registering the driver in the appropriate
kernel tables), while the second is in charge of releasing any
resources the module has allocated and deregistering the driver
from the kernel tables.</p><p>If these functions are not there, <b  >insmod</b>
will fail to load your module.</p><p>The <b  >init_module()</b> function returns 0 on
success and a negative value on failure. The
<b  >cleanup_module()</b> function returns
<b  >void</b>, because it only gets invoked when the
module is known to be unloadable. A kernel module keeps a usage
count, and <b  >cleanup_module()</b> is only called when
that counter's value is 0 (more on this later on).</p><p>Skeletal code for these two functions will be presented in
the next installment. Their design is fundamental for proper
loading and unloading of the module, and a few details must dealt
with. So here, I'll introduce you to each of the details, so that
next month I can present the structure without explaining all the
details.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a53580.0x1b44518"></a>Getting a major number</h2></div></div><p>Both character drivers and block drivers must register
themselves in a kernel array; this step is fundamental for the
driver to be used. After <b  >init_module()</b> returns,
the driver's code segment is part of the kernel, and won't ever be
called again unless the driver registers its functionality. Linux,
like most Unix flavors, keeps an array of device drivers, and each
driver is identified by a number, called the major number, which is
nothing more than the index in the array of available
drivers.</p><p>The major number of a device is the first number appearing in
the output of <b  >ls -l</b> for the device file. The
other one is the minor number (you guessed it). All the devices
(file nodes) featuring the same major number are serviced by the
same driver code.</p><p>It is clear that your modularized driver needs its own major
number. The problem is that the kernel currently uses a static
array to hold driver information, and the array is as small as 64
entries (it used to be 32, but it was increased during the 1.2
kernel development because of lack of major numbers).</p><p>Fortunately, the kernel allows dynamic assignment of major
numbers. The invocation of the function</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int register_chrdev(unsigned int major,
                    const char *name,
                    struct file_operations *fops);
</pre><p>will register your char-driver within the kernel. The first
argument is either the number you are requesting or 0, in which
case dynamic allocation is performed. The function returns a number
less than 0 to signal an error, and 0 or greater to signal
successful completion. If you asked for a dynamically assigned
number, the positive return value is the major number your driver
was assigned. The <b  >name</b> argument is the name of
your driver, and is what appears within the /proc/devices file.
finally, <b  >fops</b> is the structure used for calling
all the other functions in your driver, and will be described later
on.</p><p>Using dynamic allocation of major numbers is a winning choice
for custom device drivers: you're assured that your device number
doesn't conflict with any other device within your system&mdash;you're
assured that <b  >register_chrdev()</b> will succeed,
unless you have loaded so many devices that you have run out of
free device numbers, which is unlikely.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a53580.0x1b449e8"></a>Loading and unloading</h2></div></div><p>Since the major number is recorded inside the filesystem node
that applications use to access the device, dynamic allocation of
the major number means that you can't create your nodes once, and
keep them in /dev forever. You need to recreate them each time you
load your module.</p><p>The scripts in this page are the ones I use to load and to
unload my modules. A little editing will suit your own module: you
only need to change the module name and the device name.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>mknod</b></span> command creates a
device node with a given major and minor number (I'll talk about
minor numbers in the next installment), and
<span   class="bold"><b>chmod</b></span> gives the desired
permissions to the new devices.</p><p>Though some of you may dislike creating (and changing
permissions) any time the system is booted, there is nothing
strange in it. If you are concerned about becoming root to perform
the task, remember that insmod itself must be issued with root
privileges.</p><p>The loading script can be conveniently called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>drvname</em></span>_load, where
<span   class="emphasis"><em>drvname</em></span> is the prefix you use to identify your
driver; the same one used in the <b  >name</b> argument
passed to <b  >register_chrdrv()</b>. The script can be
invoked by hand during driver development, and by rc.local after
module installation. Remember that insmod looks both in the current
directory and in the installation directory (somewhere in
/lib/modules) for modules to install.</p><p>If your module depends on other modules or if your system
setup is somehow peculiar, you can invoke modprobe instead of
insmod. The modprobe utility is a refined version of insmod which
manages module dependencies and conditional loading. The tool is
quite powerful and well documented. If your driver needs exotic
handling, you're better off reading the manpage.</p><p>At time of writing, however, none of the standard tools
handles generation of device nodes for automatically allocated
major numbers, and I can't even conceive how they could know the
names and minor numbers of your driver. This means that a custom
script is needed in any case.</p><p>Here's <span   class="emphasis"><em>drvname</em></span>_load:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
# Install the <span   class="emphasis"><em>drvname</em></span> driver,

is allocating any resources needed by the driver for correct
operation. We call any tiny piece of the computer a &ldquo;resource&rdquo;,
where &ldquo;piece&rdquo; is a logical (or software) representation of a
physical part of the computer. Usually a driver will request
memory, I/O ports, and IRQ lines.</p><p>Programmers are familiar with requesting memory. The
<b  >kmalloc()</b> function will do it, and you can use
it exactly like it was <b  >malloc()</b>. Requesting I/O
ports, on the contrary, is unusual. They're there, free of charge.
There is no &ldquo;I/O port fault&rdquo; equivalent of a &ldquo;segmentation
fault&rdquo;. However, writing to I/O ports belonging to other devices
can still crash your system.</p><p>Linux implements essentially the same policy for I/O ports as
is used for memory. The only real difference is in the CPU not
generating exceptions when you write to a port address that you
have not requested. Port registering, like memory registering, is
also useful to help the kernel's housekeeping tidy.</p><p>If you ever scratched your head about the port address to
assign to your newly acquired board, you'll soon forget the
feeling: <b  >cat /proc/ioports</b> and <b  >cat
/proc/interrupts</b> will quickly uncover the secrets of your
own hardware.</p><p>Registering I/O ports you use is a little more complicated
than requesting memory, because you often have to &ldquo;probe&rdquo; to find
out where your device is. To avoid &ldquo;probing&rdquo; ports that other
devices have already registered, you can call
<b  >check_region()</b> to ask if the region you are
considering looking in is already claimed. Do this once for each
region as you probe. Once you find the device, use the
<b  >request_region()</b> function to reserve the region.
When your device is removed, it should call
<b  >release_region()</b> to free the ports. Here are the
function declarations from
<b  >&lt;linux/ioports.h&gt;</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int check_region(unsigned int from,
                 unsigned int extent);
void request_region(unsigned int from,
                    unsigned int extent,
                    const char *name);
void release_region(unsigned int from,
                    unsigned int extent);
</pre><p>The <b  >from</b> argument is the beginning of a
contiguous region, or range, of I/O ports, the
<b  >extent</b> is the number of ports in the region, and
<b  >name</b> is the name of the driver.</p><p>If you forget to register your I/O ports, nothing bad will
happen, unless you have two such misbehaving drivers, or you need
the information to fit a new board in your computer. If you forget
to release ports when unloading, any subsequent program accessing
the /proc/ioports file will &ldquo;Oops&rdquo;, because the driver name will
refer to unmapped memory. Besides, you won't be able to load your
driver again, because your own ports are no longer available. Thus,
you should be careful to free your ports.</p><p>A similar allocation policy exists for IRQ lines (see
<b  >&lt;linux/sched.h&gt;</b>):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int request_irq(uint irq,
           void (*handler)(int, struct pt_regs *),
           ulong flags, const char *name);
void free_irq(uint irq);
</pre><p>Note again that <b  >name</b> is what appears in
the /proc/ files, and thus should be rather
<b  ><i><tt>myhardware</tt></i></b> than
<b  ><i><tt>mydrv</tt></i></b>.</p><p>If you forget to register IRQ lines, your interrupt handler
won't be called; if you forget to unregister, you won't be able to
read /proc/interrupts. In addition, if the board continues
generating irq's after your handler is unloaded, something weird
may happen (I can't tell exactly, because it never happened to me,
and I'm not likely to try it in order to document it here). [I
<span   class="emphasis"><em>think</em></span> you get a kernel panic, but I've never
managed (or tried) to make it happen, either&mdash;ED]</p><p>The last point I'd like to touch here is introduced by
Linus's comment in <b  >&lt;linux/io.h&gt;</b>: you have
to <span   class="emphasis"><em>find</em></span> your hardware. If you want to make
usable drivers, you have to autodetect your devices. Autodetection
is vital if you want to distribute your driver to the general
public, but don't call it &ldquo;Plug and Play&rdquo;, since that is now a
trademark.</p><p>The hardware should detect both the ioports and the irq
number. If the board doesn't tell which IRQ line it will use, you
can go through a trial and error technique&mdash;it works great, if you
do it carefully. The technique will be covered in a later
installment.</p><p>When you know the irq number of your device, you should use
<b  >free_irq()</b> to release it before returning from
<b  >module_init()</b>. You can request it again when
your device is actually opened. If you keep hold of the interrupt,
you won't be able to multiplex hardware on it (and the i386 has too
few IRQ lines to allow wasting them). Thus I run plip and my frame
grabber on the same interrupt without unloading any module&mdash;I just
open only one of them at a time.</p><p>Unfortunately, there exist some rare times where
autodetection won't work, so you must provide a way to pass
information to the driver about ports and irqs. A probe will
usually fail only during system boot, when the first drivers have
access to several unregistered devices, and can mistake another
device for the one it looks for. Sometimes probing for a device can
be &ldquo;destructive&rdquo; for another device, preventing its future
initialization. Both these problems shouldn't happen to a module,
which comes last, and thus can't request ports belonging to other
devices. Nonetheless, a way to disable autodetection and force
values in the driver is an important feature to implement. At
least, it's easier than autodetection, and can help you in
successfully loading the module before autodetection is
there.</p><p>Load-time configuration will be the first topic of next
issue, where the full source of <b  >init_module()</b>
and <b  >cleanup_modul</b>e will be uncovered.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a53580.0x1e59a00"></a>Additional information</h2></div></div><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Kernel Korner</em></span> columns of the
following months will introduce further points of module-writing.
Code samples can be found inside the kernel and on ftp sites near
you.</p><p>In particular, what I describe is based on my personal
experience with device drivers: both the
<b  >ceddrv-0.<i><tt>xx</tt></i></b> and
<b  >cxdrv-0.<i><tt>xx</tt></i></b> resemble
the code I describe. Georg Zezschwitz and I wrote the ceddrv, which
drives a lab interface (A/D, D/A, bells and whistles). The cxdrv
driver is simpler, and drives a memory-mapped frame grabber. The
latest versions of both drivers are available on
ftp://iride.unipv.it/pub/linux for public ftp.
<span   class="bold"><b>ceddrv</b></span> is also on tsx-11.mit.edu,
while <b  >cxdev</b> is on sunsite.unc.edu in
apps/video.</p><p>There are quite a few books about device drivers out there,
but they're often too system-specific and describe an awkward
interface&mdash;Linux is easier. Generic books about Unix internals and
the kernel source are the best teachers. I'd suggest to get one of
