and Yellow Dog 2.0. I cannot gain access to files on my Mac OS 9.1
partition. I assumed that my Mac OS partition was hda1, but this
may be wrong.</p><p>&mdash;Bill MacKay, w.mackay1@ntlworld.com</p><p>It's not hda1. Macs use a rather complex partitioning scheme.
Use the command <b  >cat /proc/partitions</b> to see all
your partitions. That should help you narrow it down.</p><p>&mdash;Ben Ford, ben@kalifornia.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e7d580.0x1f75348"></a>Firewall Takes Hours to Start</h2></div></div><p>I upgraded the kernel of my Red Hat 6.0 system to 2.2.16-3 in
order to use ipchains. I used the instructions from
<a href="http://www.redhat.com" target="_self">www.redhat.com</a> support
to upgrade the kernel. It now works great as a dedicated firewall.
Whenever the power goes out, I reboot the machine and run the
/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall script, which I obtained from
<a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org" target="_self">www.linuxdoc.org</a>, and
this takes an hour to complete. Is there some way to speed up this
process?</p><p>&mdash;Paul Lamping, palamping@yahoo.com</p><p>Are you using a large hard drive with ext2 as your
filesystem? In that case, the process that is taking so long is the
filesystem checking process due to an improper shutdown. There are
a couple of things you can do about that. You can try a journaling
filesystem, use a UPS battery backup to shut down gracefully, or
get creative with your drive partitioning and make as much of it
read-only as you can.</p><p>&mdash;Ben Ford, ben@kalifornia.com</p><p>Setting up your firewall rules should be a matter of seconds,
not minutes or hours. One thing that may be causing problems is if
you use names for hosts rather than IP addresses. If your boot
scripts start your name server after your firewall script runs,
this forces each line that does a DNS lookup to time out before
continuing. This can also be the case if you refer to a name server
on another machine and your firewall script locks the machine out
before creating &ldquo;allow&rdquo; entries.</p><p>&mdash;Chad Robinson, crobinson@rfgonline.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e7d580.0x1f756b8"></a>Printing Stopped Working</h2></div></div><p>I have been printing to a Jetdirect-enabled HP LaserJet 4Plus
on our LAN for several years using its IP address. It recently
stopped working. Running any lp command (lpq, lpr, etc.) returns
the following message:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

Make sure LPD server is running on the server
</pre><p>&mdash;Murray Zangen, murray@nj.com
</p><p>Have you tried rebooting the printer? This problem is a
symptom of the recently seen CodeRed IIS and indexing server worm.
It stops many printers and Cisco devices cold.</p><p>&mdash;Ben Ford, ben@kalifornia.com</p><p>It appears that your problem is local to the box, not to the
HP printer. LP is telling you that LPD is not running on the local
server, which it must connect to in order to queue the request for
the remote printer. Check the output of <b  >ps ax</b> to
ensure that LPD is running properly. If it is, you should also
check connectivity to your printer manually by Telneting to the IP
address given by /etc/printcap. Finally, make sure you are
selecting the correct print queue, and print a test job using
<b  >lp</b> from the command line rather than printing
from an application.</p><p>&mdash;Chad Robinson, crobinson@rfgonline.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e7d580.0x1f75a80"></a>How to Change Samba Passwords</h2></div></div><p>I have configured Samba and my server shows up in Network
Neighborhood on my Win98 workstations. I can see the folders on my

standard installation you need to modify the registry on the

make a filesystem on it.</p><p>&mdash;Kevin Williams, williams_kevin@btconnect.com</p><p>First, figure out what device you are talking about. Here is
a simple chart to determine device names: /dev/hda1 master drive on
primary channel, 1st partition /dev/hda2 master drive on primary
channel, 2nd partition /dev/hdb1 slave drive on primary channel,
1st partition /dev/hdb2 slave drive on primary channel, 2nd
partition /dev/hdc1 master drive on secondary channel, 1st
partition /dev/hdc2 master drive on secondary channel, 2nd
partition /dev/hdd1 slave drive on secondary channel, 1st partition
/dev/hdd2 slave drive on secondary channel, 2nd partition Next,
choose the filesystem you would like on it. SuSE includes reiserfs
with their distro; I recommend that as it doesn't require tedious
filesystem checks on a bad reboot. Then format the drive. The
command used to make reiserfs partition is <b  >mkreiserfs
&lt;<i><tt>devicename</tt></i>&gt;</b>, where
&lt;devicename&gt; is the device name of your partition. If you
want to stick with ext2, use the same command but replace
mkreiserfs with mke2fs. Now you have a useable drive partition; all
that is left is to mount it. Choose or create a mountpoint in your
filesystem. I will use /mnt/storage for this example. Create the
mountpoint with <b  >mkdir /mnt/storage</b>. As you see,
the mountpoint is nothing more than a directory. Now mount the
drive like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mount &lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>devicename</em></span>&gt; /mnt/storage -t &lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>filesystem
type</em></span>&gt;
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>where &lt;</em></span>devicename&gt; is the device
name of the partition and &lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>filesystem
type</em></span>&gt; is the type of filesystem. You now have another
useable hard drive. One step remains. I assume you want this
accessible next time you boot the system, so we need to add the
partition to /etc/fstab. Add a line like this to that file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>devicename</em></span>&gt;     &lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>mountpoint</em></span>&gt;     &lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>filesystem type</em></span>&gt; defaults     0 0
</pre>


<span   class="emphasis"><em>where &lt;</em></span>devicename&gt; is the device name of
your partition, &lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>mountpoint</em></span>&gt; is the
mountpoint you are using and &lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>filesystem
type</em></span>&gt; is the type of filesystem on that partition. If
you choose to use reiserfs, leave the last two numbers as 0 0. If
you use ext2, make those numbers 1 2.

BT card.</p><p>&mdash;Khoa Nguyen, knguyen@megisto.com</p><p>Use netconfig to set up your networking. You can also use
lsmod to see if the module for that card is loaded. I would guess
that the module for that card would be the 3c90x. You may have to
load this module by hand if the card isn't automatically detected
by using the command <b  >modprobe 3c90x</b>. If this
works, edit the file /etc/modules.conf and add the line
<b  >alias eth0 3c90x</b>.</p><p>&mdash;Ben Ford, ben@kalifornia.com</p></div></div>
