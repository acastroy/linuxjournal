    Thoughts about Jabber's youthful and enthusiasticdevelopment team.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfae580.0x10a6660"></a></h2></div></div><p>At the first break on the first day of
Jabbercon, four members of the development team made their way over
to say hi. The first to arrive was Eliot Landrum who told me how
much he liked the new <i  >Linux Journal</i> design
changes, for which I thanked him. Then Julian Missig, Justin Mecham
and Schuyler Heath followed. They looked like a high-school chess
team, but by now I've learned never to let looks deceive me. These
guys were short in the tooth but long on programming skills, and
they helped make Jabber something worthy of its first conference.
</p><p>I asked them how they described Jabber to people who never
heard of it before. &ldquo;Distributed open-source instant messaging&rdquo;,
Eliot said. The others kind of nodded along, but their expressions
said &ldquo;whatever&rdquo;. Which is kind of true, too.</p><p>In fact, they were far more curious than opinionated. Eliot
said something like, &ldquo;We've been sending out these messages into
space, and we want to see what bounces back from other
civilizations.&rdquo; Among the civilizations he's talking about are
businesses excited about what he and his cohorts have created. On
the attendee list I saw emissaries from Intel, Earthlink, Disney,
PeoplePC, Swiscom and a bunch of less familiar companies, some of
which were reportedly doing some very interesting stuff. One with a
lot of buzz was Nuance, which lets you use your cell phone as an IM
(instant-messaging) client in a real-time,
speech-to-text-and-back-again conversation over a Jabber transport.
Another was Oracom, which uses Jabber for worldwide network
management in real time.</p><p>Both of these are examples are of what we might call
&ldquo;embedded IM&rdquo; if that label didn't seem to exclude XML routing
and presence management&mdash;to name a couple other virtues that make
Jabber easily embeddable and so far outside the AOL-defined meaning
of IM that it begs a whole new label.</p><p>&ldquo;Platform&rdquo; isn't it. As with embedded Linux, Jabber is
deeply structural, yet too dedicated to arcane purposes to justify
the &ldquo;platform&rdquo; label, which now more legitimately belongs to the
Net than to any operating system. Jabber's job is not to make its
own presence known (or in dot-com parlance, to &ldquo;brand&rdquo; itself)
but to add presence and data routing (by XML) to the growing roster
of fundamental and ubiquitous internet services.</p><p>So I look at these guys and ask a rude question: &ldquo;How old
are you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nineteen&rdquo;, says one. &ldquo;Seventeen&rdquo;, says another.
&ldquo;Nineteen.&rdquo; &ldquo;Twenty-one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How old is Jeremie?&rdquo; I ask. Jeremie Miller is the Linus of
Jabber, the programmer whose itch Jabber first scratched. &ldquo;He has
two kids. What is he, 26?&rdquo; &ldquo;Twenty-four, I think.&rdquo;</p><p>I realize that I'm older than any three of them put together
(giving new meaning to the title senior editor), but I don't bring
it up. Nor do I bring up the observation that Jabber is, like its
creators, still much closer to ground zero than to whatever it
ultimately will become. In their &ldquo;look, we can do this&rdquo; quality,
the presentations I saw at the show sent my mind back 20 years to
when the PC was brand new, and everything you could do with it was
novel and fun, yet still just prototypes for stuff that ultimately
would become indispensable.</p><p>Like approximately everybody, I knew nothing about Jabber in
early 1999. That was when my friend Perry Evans (who is perhaps
best known as the founder of MapQuest) told me about it and
wondered what I thought. He said Jabber was the quiet brainchild of
a quiet 22-year-old programmer who hacked in the quiet farm country
of Iowa. As instant messaging went, it had the same relation to
AOL's system as the Internet had to, well, AOL. It was open source.
It was XML. It let anybody deploy their own IM server just like
they deploy an open-source web or mail server. And, because it was
essentially an XML router, it had all kinds of interesting
implications for just about everything.</p><p>Perry wanted to pump my brain for some thinking about how to
support Jabber open-source development with some kind of business
that would make money by selling Jabber-based products and
services. I had ideas, but I knew Eric Raymond would have a lot
more, so I invited him to join the conversation. Eventually Perry
and his company, Webb Interactive Services, created Jabber, Inc.,
and I joined its advisory board (now rebranded the Open Board), as
did Eric and other familiar folks from the Open Source
community.</p><p>So here I was at Jabbercon, wearing three hats:
<i  >Linux Journal</i> editor, Jabber, Inc. Open Board
member and speaker/panelist. When it came time to deliver the goods
in that third capacity, I had to admit that after more than two
years of trying to figure it out, nobody had the surefire formula
for dealing with what Craig Burton, speaking at the same
conference, called the &ldquo;Infrastructure Paradox&rdquo;, which is
&ldquo;balancing the business of generating shareholder value while
fostering global ubiquity.&rdquo;</p><p>But, there was some hope in his next remarks: &ldquo;The market is
constantly in the process of correcting itself toward construction
modularity. This correction process causes alignment in
architecture design and redistribution of competency.&rdquo; Needless to
say, this has been the story of Linux's success, especially as an
embedded OS.</p><p>But it seemed to me that &ldquo;redistribution of competency&rdquo; is
an overly commodified way of describing what was really going on
here. Instead we had both obsoleting of irrelevance and origination
of competency. What these guys were making with Jabber was not only
highly original stuff, but stuff that was good for a lot more
origination as well. Could it be that this was because these guys
were not too far from having been originated themselves?</p><p>I don't think it's a coincidence that Linus Torvalds and
Jeremie Miller were both around 21 when they introduced their
inventions to the world, or that they've made it possible for the
rest of us to do the maximum range of original work. The fact that
both Linux and Jabber are still so young only makes them that much
more indispensable.</p></div></div>
