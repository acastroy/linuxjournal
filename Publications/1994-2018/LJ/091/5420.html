    Focusing on maximum crunching power and PC hardware whendeveloping the Ultimate Linux Box (ULB).
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x102c580.0x11247c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Five years ago, I wrote an article for
<i  >Linux Journal</i> that developed a recipe for an
elegant and economical Linux box. The article became one of the
most popular in <i  >LJ</i>'s history, so the editors
have invited me back for a second round.
</p><p><a href="5420s1.html" target="_self">The UL Web Server</a></p><p>This time around <i  >LJ</i> recruited Rick Moen,
author of some well-known FAQs on modems and other hardware topics,
to assist. Daryll Strauss, the man behind the famous Linux
renderfarm used in the movie <span   class="emphasis"><em>Titanic</em></span>,
contributed sage advice from his background in graphics and extreme
data crunching. Also, instead of going for economy we're going to
go for maximum crunching power. We're going to ask how to get the
absolute highest performance out of hardware we can live
with.</p><p>Hardware you can live with means a machine that is stable,
easy to troubleshoot and inexpensive to maintain. It should be
small and low-maintenance enough to live beside your desk, not some
liquid-cooled monstrosity. It should be, in short, a PC&mdash;a
gold-plated hot rod of a PC but a PC nevertheless. Other important
aspects of livability are the levels of emitted acoustic noise and
heat; we'll be minimizing both.</p><p>We'll stick with PC hardware. Alphas are fast and have that
wonderful, sexy 64-bit architecture, but the line seems all too
likely to be killed in favor of the Itanium before long. Considered
in isolation, I like the PowerPC chip a lot better than any x86
architecture. But PC hardware has all the advantages of being the
biggest market; it's the easiest to get serviced and least
expensive to upgrade.</p><p>The Ultimate Linux Box that we showcase will, of course, fall
behind the leading edge within months (or even by press time). But
walking through the process of developing the ULB will teach you
things about system design and troubleshooting that you can
continue to apply long after the hardware in this article has
become obsolete.</p><p><a href="5420s2.html" target="_self">Good News, Bad News and How Can You
Justify This Thing?</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x102c580.0x1124ce8"></a>What to Optimize</h2></div></div><p>For typical job loads under Linux, the processor type is
nearly a red herring&mdash;it's far more important to specify a capable
system bus and disk I/O subsystem. If you don't believe this, you
may find it enlightening to keep top(1) running for a while as you
use your machine. Notice how seldom the CPU idle percentage drops
below 90%.</p><p>If you're building a ULB, go ahead and buy the fastest
available processor. Once you've gotten past that gearhead desire
for big numbers, pay careful attention to bus speeds and your disk
subsystem because that's where you'll achieve serious performance
wins. The gap between processor speed and I/O subsystem throughput
has only widened in the last five years, so this is even better
advice than it was in 1996.</p><p><a href="5420s4.html" target="_self">Everybody's Doing Dual
Athlons</a></p><p>How does all this translate into a recipe in 2001? Get a
PCI-bus machine, not a hybrid PCI/ISA design; you sacrifice about
10% of peak performance with those. Get the fastest available
front-side (processor-to-memory) bus (in August 2001, the maximum
is 266MHz). Get a high-speed SCSI controller and the fastest SCSI
disks you can get your hands on.</p><p>The case for SCSI is a little less obvious but still
compelling. For starters, SCSI is still at least 10%-15% faster
than IDE/ATAPI running flat out. Because it's perceived as a
professional choice, SCSI peripherals are generally better
engineered than IDE/ATAPI equivalents, and new high-performing
drive technologies tend to become available in SCSI first. You'll
pay a few dollars more, but the cost is well repaid in increased
throughput and reliability. Rick Moen comments:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>They call me a SCSI bigot. So be it&mdash;but my
hardware keeps being future-proof: I don't have to run bizarre
emulation layers to address CDRs, I never run low on IRQs or resort
to IRQ-sharing, all my hard drives have hardware-level hot-fix, all
my hard disk/CD/tape/etc., devices support a stable standard rather
than this month's cheap extension kludge, and I don't have to worry
about adverse interactions at the hardware or driver levels from
mixing ATA and SCSI.</p></blockquote></div><p>Neither Daryll nor I will have IDE in any machine we build
either.
</p><p>To pick the fastest disks, pay close attention to average
seek and latency time. The former is an average time required to
seek to any track; the latter is the maximum time required for any
sector on a track to come under the heads.</p><p>Of these, average seek time is much more important. When
you're running Linux, a one millisecond faster seek time can make a
substantial difference in system throughput. The manufacturers
themselves avoid running up seek time on larger-capacity drives by
stacking platters vertically rather than increasing platter size.
Thus, seek time, which is proportional to the platter radius and
head-motion speed, tends to be constant across different capacities
in the same product line. This is good because it means you don't
have to worry about a capacity vs. speed trade-off.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x102c580.0x1125160"></a>One Disk or Two?</h2></div></div><p>I always build with two disks: one system disk and one home
disk. There are two good reasons to do this that have nothing to do
with the extra capacity. One is the performance advantage of being
able to interleave commands to different physical spindles. The
other is I am quite a bit less likely to lose two disks at once
than I am to trash a single one.</p><p>Let's suppose you have a fatal disk crash. If you have only
one disk, good-bye Charlie. If you have two, maybe the crashed one
was your system disk, in which case you can buy another and do a
new Linux installation, knowing your personal files are safe. Or
maybe it was your home disk; in that case, you can buy another home
disk and restore it from backups (you did keep backups,
right?).</p><p><a href="5420s5.html" target="_self">Debian, Installing on Hardware Your
Distribution Doesn't Support and the ReiserFS
Two-Step</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x102c580.0x1125370"></a>Easier Choices</h2></div></div><p>Max out your memory. Lots of free memory will improve your
virtual-memory performance. Fortunately, with RAM as cheap as it is
now, a gigabyte or three is unlikely to bust your budget even if
you're economizing.</p><p>You'll need a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive (you'll almost
certainly be installing your Linux from it). You have a SCSI
system, so get a SCSI CD-ROM. That's pretty much the end of spec,
as there are only a few models of SCSI DVD-ROM, and SCSI CD-ROMs
are a generic item.</p><p>We'll want a good, high-volume backup device, too. Large
disks are so cheap that backing up your home directory to another
disk seems an attractive alternative, but it's still good to be
able to make backups that you can separate from your system and
store off-site, in case of disaster. We'll go with a DDS tape
drive. Even if you're building on the cheap, the less expensive
CD-ROM burners aren't a good idea for mass backup. The problem is
the per-megabyte cost of the media, which you can't reuse. Rick
adds: &ldquo;Tape is also faster, more rugged both in storage and in the
process of recording (jostling a DAT drive doesn't destroy the
ongoing backup), doesn't require gobs of scratch space for
assembling image files and is way, way, easier to
automate.&rdquo;</p><p>Speaking of faster, one of the things you want most in a tape
drive is transfer speed. This is a good reason to go with the newer
DDS4 tape drives, which have speed that is typically half of the
older DDS3 drives.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x102c580.0x1125580"></a>Noise Control and Heat Dissipation</h2></div></div><p>An increasingly critical aspect of machine design is handling
the waste heat and acoustic noise of operation. Cooling is
centrally important if you want your ULB to last because thermal
stress from waste heat is almost certainly what will kill it. On
the other hand, cooling makes acoustic noise, which human beings
don't tolerate well. It's fair to say we've already reached the
point at which the thermal load vs. cooling-noise trade-off is the
effective limiting factor in the performance of personal
machines.</p><p>So how do we manage this trade-off for a personal, desktop or
desk-side machine? Being willing to pay a price premium for
cool-running and low-noise parts can help a lot. Even clueful
system integrators can't afford to do this because they're under
constant competitive pressure to cut costs by using generic
components. But, we aren't economizing here; we get to do it
right.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x102c580.0x11256e0"></a>The Recipe File</h2></div></div><p>Now that we've laid out the principles, it's time to do the
practice&mdash;specify and build a machine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x102c580.0x11257e8"></a>Processor, Motherboard and Memory</h2></div></div><p>In July 2001, the clear standout choice for a ULB motherboard
is the Tyan Thunder K7, model S2462 (see the Sidebar titled &ldquo;AMD,
SMP, AGP and LEDs: the Tyan Thunder K7 S2462&rdquo;).</p><p><a href="5420s3.html" target="_self">AMD, SMP, AGP and LEDs: the Tyan
Thunder K7 S2462</a></p><p>There are good and bad consequences of having your
peripherals onboard. The good ones are that the board has fewer
points of failure and will throw less heat. The downside is that
integration could make fault recovery more difficult. You want to
minimize the chance that a failure in one onboard component will
require an immediate motherboard swap. On the S2462, all the
onboard peripherals can be jumpered out or disabled from the BIOS
setup screens.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x102c580.0x11259f8"></a>Choosing a Case</h2></div></div><p>Internal expansion space isn't very important anymore because
two-drive bays will hold more disk than you'll ever need. External
bays are more important; you want one CD-ROM, one tape, one floppy
and perhaps a DVD drive. That's one exposed floppy bay, three
exposed half-height 5.25" bays and two internal bays.</p><p>There are three other important things you want from a case:
good airflow design, component accessibility and noise attenuation,
in that order. Finally, you may want your case to look neat. Good
airflow design is actually the best reason to buy a large case. You
want plenty of room for cool air to flow around the heat-generating
electronics.</p><p>Tyan's site lists cases that have been qualified with the
S2462, so I shopped around for a full tower on that list. Antec's
Performance Series offers a number of cases that Tyan qualifies,
and the swing-out side panel and quick-release drive bays featured
on all of them appealed to me. When my design evolved to include a
DVD player and the front-panel controls for a sound card, I went
with the SX1200, the full-tower version with seven exposed
bays.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x102c580.0x1125bb0"></a>Power Supply and Cooling</h2></div></div><p>For the power supply, the three of us agreed on a vendor: PC
Power &amp; Cooling. PCP &amp; C has a reputation for making good
units and, as a bonus, quiet ones. PCP &amp; C justified our
confidence when they told me of their brand-new 450A4 unit,
specifically designed for use with the S2462. And at 44dBA, the A4
counts as pretty quiet.</p><p>In May, Tom's Hardware compared 46 CPU coolers. The clear
standout is the Silverado from Noise Control, Inc., rated best in
cooling performance at 30&deg;C and second-best in noise emission,
only 37dBA. Typical coolers emit about 50dBA. The Silverado's only
real drawback is that it's large&mdash;80mm long, 56mm wide, 113mm
high&mdash;so you need to be careful about case clearances.</p><p>We can avoid having our case fans add more than a bare
minimum to the machine's decibel output by specifying cooling fans
that have ball bearings rather than the cheaper and more common
sleeve bearings. This will cut machine noise by an appreciable
degree, especially the annoying, whining high-frequency component,
which is mostly bearing noise.</p><p>PC Power &amp; Cooling makes 20dBA Silencer 80mm ball-bearing
case fans. Specify the three-pin connectors to plug into the
motherboard, not the four-pin connectors meant to be plugged into
the power supply.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x102c580.0x151e010"></a>Mass Storage</h2></div></div><p>We're going to be specifying fast-wide LVD drives, the
cutting edge in SCSI devices. Within that class, the important
statistics are seek time, rotational latency, capacity, heat
dissipation and noise output. Mean time between failure is long
enough on the leading brands that you're quite unlikely to see one
before your system is years obsolete.</p><p>A StorageReview.com search confirmed anecdotal evidence from
Rick Moen. He likes IBM's current product line, the UltraStar. With
a 4.2ms seek time, they edge ahead of competition from Seagate,
Quantum and Fujitsu. Rick believes they run relatively cool, too,
and we hear they smoked the competition in some comparative trials
run by Evi Nemeth at the CAIDA Project. So we'll add two IBM
UltraStar 36Z15 drives to the parts list.</p><p>We also want to be able to read (and write) CD-ROMs. Again,
StorageReview.com confirms Rick's anecdotal report, tapping the
32-speed Plextor PX W1210TS as the best-of-breed among SCSI CD-RW
drives.</p><p>Rick observes:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>CD-R/CD-RW drives by their nature have head
assemblies much more massive than those of ordinary read-only CD
drives. Why? Because they mount burn lasers. Much greater mass
means much greater inertia and much faster mechanical wear, and the
considerable heat generated during burn cycles also takes its toll.
Accordingly, the MTBF times for CD-R/CD-RW drives are markedly
shorter than for regular CD drives. One should not use CD-R/CD-RW
drives for mundane read operations, but rather only for CD-burning.
Accordingly, if you really have the need for a CD-R or CD-RW drive,
you also need a second, read-only drive for everyday
CD-reading.</p></blockquote></div><p>Daryll Strauss chimes in with: &ldquo;Buy a DVD-ROM rather than an
ordinary CD-ROM. Typically the transfer rates are just as good, if
not better, because the base DVD rotational speed is higher to
begin with.&rdquo;
</p><p>A DVD is a must-have for another reason; any true dream
system for a Linux hacker must include the ability to violate the
anti-fair-use clauses of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act by
playing DVDs, even if (like me) the hacker is basically
uninterested in DVDs per se. It's ethically imperative.</p><p>Presently, only two models of SCSI DVD-ROM are available: the
304S/305S by Pioneer and the SD-M1201B by Toshiba. The Toshiba is
5X as a DVD drive and 32X as a CD-ROM drive; the Pioneer's numbers
are 10X and 40X. Easy call, especially since the Toshiba is
actually more expensive.</p><p>History says that the top-of-the-line Hewlett-Packard tape
drive is either going to be the best-of-breed or close. The
top-of-the-line HP DDS4 drive appears to be the C5685, with a
capacity of 40GB and a transfer rate of 21.6GB/hour (assuming
hardware compression).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x102c580.0x151e430"></a>Monitor Graphics Card and Sound</h2></div></div><p>For my purposes, clearly displaying a lot of text at
relatively small font sizes is the most important thing I want a
monitor to do. Thus I pick the only monitor <span   class="emphasis"><em>PC
World</em></span> rates as excellent at both text and graphics, the
Mitsubishi Diamond Pro 2060u. It supports 2048 &times; 1536 at
75Hz, a refresh speed comfortably above flicker level.</p><p>Daryll is a graphics expert and part of the team working on
the Linux drivers for ATI's high-end Radeon card. He tells us that
for the foreseeable future (or at least until NVIDIA gets a clue
about open source) the Radeon will be the best high-end graphics
card with entirely open-source drivers. So we add one ATI Radeon
64MB card.</p><p>Because this is a development box rather than a gaming
machine, it's more important that a sound card be well supported
with stable drivers than that it hug the bleeding edge of audio
technology. The safe choice seems to be the SoundBlaster Live
Platinum 5.1. ConsumerSearch's top speaker pick, rated excellent
for both game play and music, is the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1.</p><p><a href="5420s6.html" target="_self">Graphics: Safety or

Model M keyboard about 20 years ago. They have a relatively stiff
travel with a sharp break and a positive keyclick that can only be
described as crunchy. They inspire cult-like devotion. It's still
possible to buy the real Model M, armor-plated case and all.
They're not being manufactured anymore, but old stocks are still
being sold. You want these IBM model numbers: 42H1292 (IBM 101-key,
buckling-spring keyboard) and 1393278 (IBM SpaceSaver compact,
heavy-duty 84 keyboard). They're both available from Unicomp. The
dream system will get one of the 101-key PC-2 versions.</p><p><a href="5420s8.html" target="_self">Keyboard</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x102c580.0x151e958"></a>Miscellanea</h2></div></div><p>For my own use, I'll keep my original three-button Logitech
TrackMan Marble. Sadly, Logitech doesn't make the original Marble
any more; the replacement has a rather obtrusive wheel replacing
the middle button.</p><p>There is only one possible modem for the dream system: the US
Robotics V.Everything, external version. This featureful,
rock-solid, reliable modem is the first choice of discriminating
hackers everywhere. Rick has written an entertaining rant on the
likely consequences of choosing lesser external modems, or any
internal modem at all.</p><p>The floppy drive is a relic of the age before bootable
CD-ROMs. Occasionally you'll want one for booting up diagnostic
software. A plain old TEAC 1.44 3.5" drive will do.</p><p>Oh, yes, the software. I realize that the topic of favorite
Linux distribution is a religious war, but I can't resist putting
in a plug for my own favorite: KRUD Linux from Kevin Fenzi and the
good folks at tummy.com. Subscribing to KRUD gives you a Red Hat
base plus a monthly update, including all security fixes and a
tasty selection of additional programs and tools.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x102c580.0x151eb68"></a>System Integration</h2></div></div><p>We have two SCSI controllers. That's good, because we also
have both LVD and single-ended SCSI devices in our parts list.
Daryll observes:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>LVD drives can drive the bus at 40MHz and 80MHz,
whereas single-ended cannot. If you mix single-ended and LVD, the
bus degrades to single-ended. So a bus with a single-ended device
tops out at 20MHz Wide SCSI or 40MB/s, whereas LVD gets you up to
160MB/s.</p></blockquote></div><p>Thus, we want to assemble the dream machine with two SCSI
chains: a high-speed wide/LVD chain for the hard drives and tape,
and a low-speed narrow/single-end chain for the CD-RW and DVD-ROM.
We used an SM-20 from The Mate Company to convert the second
motherboard channel to 50-pin narrow SCSI.
</p><p>Because the hard drives are likely to be significant heat
generators, we mount them with the spare internal bay between them,
rather than stacking them in adjacent drive bays, to get better
airflow.</p><p>The Antec case makes it possible to mount the intake fan
directly in front of the hard disks. Normally, with drives in this
class, the drives and the bay enclosure become uncomfortably hot to
the touch; with this setup, the warmth is barely noticeable. This
is a good thing because it probably extends the expected lifetime
of the drives significantly. Another fan near the power supply at
the rear helps pull air out of the machine. We ended up mounting a
third fan because we noticed the memory chips seemed to be running
hot.</p><p>We'll have two expansion cards in the machine, the
SoundBlaster Live! and the Radeon. The Radeon will probably tend to
run hot, the SoundBlaster not. Happily, the Radeon lives in the AGP
slot at the upper end of the slot row, where the air it heats will
be sucked into the two rear fans.</p><p>How does our noise budget look? IBM says our UltraStars emit
48dBA each, PCP &amp; C says the power supply emits 44dBA and the
fans 20dBA each, and Tom's Hardware rated the Silverado at 37dBA
(but there are two). Applying the logarithmic-sum formula gives us
52dBA as the level of interior noise. Assuming the case blocks 8dB,
that will leave us with an exterior noise level of 44dBA adjacent
to the case. We can trim another 5dB or so by putting the machine
desk-side.</p><p>Recalculating with four or five case fans barely nudges the
second decimal place in the total. This means that in case our
initial burn-in reveals a heat problem; we've got room to cool
things down without making the machine substantially
noisier.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x102c580.0x151ef30"></a>Building the Machine</h2></div></div><p>Gary Sandine and John Pearson at Los Alamos Computers
undertook to assemble my Ultimate Linux Box; in fact, they

courage was rewarded when IBM generously volunteered $15,000 for

to gold-plate as much of the system as possible and load on all the
extras and accessories I could, and I was still unable to raise the
total parts bill over $7,000 US.</p><p>If we discarded the most extravagant peripherals&mdash;the Klipsch
speakers, the Radeon, and the DVD and DDS drives&mdash;the cost would
drop to a quite reasonable $4,200 US or so. As Rick pungently
observes, &ldquo;People pay more than that for crap computers every
day.&rdquo; This design will be available for purchase from Los Alamos
