Linux 2.4.0 kernel early this year, GNU/Linux received a major
boost toward entering the realm of enterprise-class operating
systems. Several areas of the kernel have been improved since the
2.2.x series, not the least of which is the firewall code.
Netfilter in the 2.4.x kernel series replaces the old ipchains
firewall code in the 2.2.x series and incorporates many features
that are required in an enterprise-class firewall, such as
statefullness, DoS protection/rate limiting, network address
translation (NAT), MAC address filtering and, last but not least,
TCP packet filtering and logging based on arbitrary combinations of
TCP flags. By contrast, ipchains (in addition to not being
stateful, etc.) have the lamentable limitation of being able to
distinguish between only two types of TCP packets: those that set
and those that do not set the SYN flag. Netfilter's ability to
distinguish arbitrary TCP flag combinations allows advanced port
scans, such as those that are easily leveraged against a machine
via nmap, to be detected. First we need a bit of background on nmap
so that we can illustrate both how advanced port scans work and how
to detect them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe01580.0xef97c0"></a>nmap</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>nmap</b></span> is the world's
best-known port scanner and incorporates many advanced port
scanning techniques that can be used to detect open ports on a
target machine and/or network. In addition, nmap incorporates
operating system fingerprinting and TCP sequence number prediction
(among other things) to give better reconnaissance information than
can be gleaned by determining which ports are open on a target
machine. Three particularly interesting types of TCP scanning modes
that nmap supports are FIN, NULL and XMAS scans. In normal TCP
traffic, a FIN packet (or packet that has the FIN flag set) can be
sent by either end of a TCP connection indicating that the session
is finished or, more precisely, that there is no more data to be
sent. A FIN scan works on the principle that an orphaned FIN packet
(i.e., one that is not already part of an existing TCP session)
sent to an open TCP port should not be acknowledged. If such a
packet is sent to a closed port, however, a normal unfiltered TCP
stack is supposed to respond with an RST packet. Hence, to scan a
host with FIN packets, nmap simply sends a single FIN packet to
each of the target ports and waits for RST packets to trickle back.
Ports that do not respond with an RST are open (or filtered by a
firewall). Both the NULL and XMAS scans function similarly, but
instead of setting only the FIN flag, the XMAS scan also sets the
URG and PSH flags, whereas the NULL scan utilizes TCP packets that
have no flag set whatsoever.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe01580.0xef9920"></a>Setting up Netfilter</h2></div></div><p>The basic principle in setting up a secure firewall is to
have a default deny stance in which all traffic not explicitly
allowed by the firewall is denied or rejected. In addition, the
firewall should be configured to log any unauthorized packets to a
log file for analysis by the system administrator or by automated
logfile watchers such as psad.</p><p>For more information on getting iptables to run on your
system, I highly recommend Rusty Russell's &ldquo;Netfilter HOWTO&rdquo;,
available at
<a href="http://netfilter.samba.org" target="_self">netfilter.samba.org</a>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

packet (regardless of TCP flags) sent to a destination port other
than 80 or 22 will be logged by rule number four and then dropped
by rule number five. This takes care of any noisy scans of any type
against any of the 65535 TCP ports other than 80 and 20. What about
scans that test whether 80 and 22 are open? The answer is that it
depends upon the type of scan. Rules three and four accept packets
that have the SYN flag set and all other flags cleared, so any scan
that makes use of just SYN packets will succeed. Also, any scans
that make use of normal TCP connect() system calls, as a normal web
browser or SSH client would use, will succeed since rule number one
allows three-way TCP handshakes to complete.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>nmap</b></span> supports both of these
scanning techniques with the -sS (half-open or SYN scan) and -sT
(TCP connect() scan) command-line switches. Any other scanning
technique that is not based on legitimate TCP traffic to these
ports will be blocked and logged. Such scans include the FIN, XMAS
and NULL scans mentioned in the nmap section, as well as SYN/FIN
and ACK scans.</p><p>Now that we are reasonably confident that our iptables
firewall will block port scans, we should not become complacent
with our success. It is not enough just to block scans; we should
also do our level best to detect them, as a port scan could be a
precursor to a more advanced attack.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe01580.0xef9d40"></a>Introducing psad</h2></div></div><p>The Port Scan Attack Detector (psad) is a program written
entirely in Perl and designed to work with restrictive
ipchains/iptables rulesets in order to detect both TCP and UDP port
scans. It features a set of highly configurable danger thresholds
(with sensible defaults provided), e-mail alerting, optional
automatic blocking of offending IP addresses via dynamic
reconfiguration of ipchains/iptables firewall rulesets, and verbose
alert messages that include the source, destination, scanned port
range, begin and end times, dns and whois lookups. For iptables
firewalls, psad makes use of the extended logging capability to
detect highly suspect scans, such as FIN, XMAS and NULL, that are
easily leveraged against a target machine via nmap. In addition,
psad incorporates many of the TCP and UDP signatures included with
the Snort intrusion detection system to detect scans and/or traffic
to various backdoor programs (e.g., EvilFTP, GirlFriend, SubSeven)
and DDoS tools (mstream, shaft).
<span   class="bold"><b>psad</b></span> is free software released
under the GNU Public License and is available from
<a href="http://www.cipherdyne.com" target="_self">www.cipherdyne.com</a>.</p><p>The basic task of psad is to make use of firewall log
messages generated by either ipchains or iptables to detect suspect
network traffic. To accomplish this task, psad needs a way of
efficiently getting the data it needs from the log messages the
firewall writes to syslog. Hence, upon installation psad creates a
named pipe called psadfifo in the /var/log/ directory and
reconfigures syslogd to write all kern.info messages to the pipe.
In syslog parlance both ipchains and iptables log messages are
reported via the kern facility at a log level of info. The bulk of
the work done by psad is accomplished by two separate d&aelig;mons:
kmsgsd and psad.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe01580.0xef9f50"></a>kmsgsd</h2></div></div><p>The kmsgsd d&aelig;mon is relatively simple and its sole
responsibilities are to open the psadfifo pipe, read any kern.info
messages that indicate ipchains/iptables has denied or rejected a
packet and write all such messages to the psad data file
/var/log/psad/fwdata. Since the regex included within kmsgsd looks
only for packets that have been denied or rejected, the fwdata file
provides psad with a distilled data stream that contains
information that may be significant exclusively from a security
perspective. However, this information is only as complete and
verbose as the firewall is able to generate, hence the need for the
most restrictive possible firewall ruleset.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>iptables</b></span> does not support a
logging option for any rule that drops or rejects packets. An easy
solution to this, though, is to precede any drop rule with a
logging rule that uses the --log-prefix option. See rule number
four of simplefirewall.sh. The kmsgsd code snippet in Listing 1
illustrates reading firewall messages from the psadfifo named pipe
and using the regex to match any dropped packet messages generated
by either ipchains or iptables.</p><p><a href="4876l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Reading Firewall Messages
with kmsgsd</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe01580.0xefa1b8"></a>psad</h2></div></div><p>Once the fwdata file is populated with packets that have been
denied, it is the responsibility of the psad d&aelig;mon to analyze
and make judgments about whether or not the packets constitute a
port scan or other suspect network traffic.
<span   class="bold"><b>psad</b></span> accomplishes this by
periodically checking fwdata for new lines indicating that packets
have been denied recently by the firewall. Port scans are assigned
a danger level from one to five based on how many packets are
denied within a fixed period of time. However, a scan may also be
assigned a danger level depending on whether it matches any of the
set of nasty signatures contained within the psad_signatures file.
Examples of such signatures include &ldquo;NMAP Fingerprint attempt&rdquo;
(for any packet that sets the URG, PSH, SYN and FIN flags) and
&ldquo;DDoS - mstream client to handler&rdquo; (for a SYN packet destined for
port 15104).</p><p>After a port scan reaches a predetermined danger threshold,
an e-mail is sent that contains several pieces of information: the
source IP from which the scan originated, the destination IP, the
range of newly scanned ports (TCP or UDP) within the last scan
interval, the complete range of scanned ports since the beginning
of the scan (TCP and UDP), the start and end times, the danger
level assigned by psad, reverse dns information, the TCP flags that
were used in the scan (along with the corresponding nmap
command-line options that would generate such as scan) and whois
information.</p><p>Instead of appealing to the whois client installed by default
on any Linux distribution, psad makes use of an excellent whois
client written by Marco d'Itri. This client has the advantage of
accurately querying the correct whois database for almost any
scanning source IP address. <span   class="bold"><b>psad</b></span>
also features the ability to reconfigure an ipchains/iptables
ruleset to block any IP address that has reached a sufficiently
high danger threshold. This feature is disabled by default, since
many administrators do not want volunteer administrators across the
Net having the ability to force the firewall to block access to any
web site they choose by spoofing nasty packets from the web site's
IP address.</p><p>Some administrators, however, like the ability to set a high
threshold for a port scan or other nasty traffic and have psad
block it automatically. Note that any traffic analyzed by psad has
already been blocked by the firewall. But if a scan reaches a
sufficiently high threshold, the auto-blocking feature will block
all traffic from the offending source IP, since the administrator
would probably not want such an IP sending any packets to the local
network, legitimate or not.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>psad</b></span> also includes a signal
handler such that if a USR1 signal is sent to the psad process,
psad calls Data::Dumper to dump the contents of the %Scan hash to
the /var/log/psad/scan_hash.$$ file, where the $$ represents the
pid of the psad process. The %Scan hash is the main psad data
structure and contains all scan information, and hence dumping its
contents is useful both as a way to capture a record of scan data
and as a debugging tool for extending psad's feature set.
<span   class="bold"><b>psad</b></span> is a work-in-progress with
much on the to-do list, but it is being developed actively and also
has a relatively short version-release cycle.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe01580.0xefa580"></a>ipchains vs. iptables Logs</h2></div></div><p>To illustrate the differences in the output of ipchains and
