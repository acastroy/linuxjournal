issue's focus, Marcel Gagn&eacute; reminds us that for many, the
word enterprise conjures up visions of Captain Kirk and the
starship under his command. But by Captain Kirk's time, the name
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Enterprise</em></span> (sometimes
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Enterprize</em></span>) was already an old one for
warships. A 12-gun US naval schooner built in 1799, the third US
naval vessel to bear the name, is perhaps the most famous (next to
the starship, of course). It was this little ship that spawned the
tradition of passing the famous name to innovative or
&ldquo;enterprising&rdquo; ships in the 20th century (i.e., a WWII aircraft
carrier and the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier). The
schooner served with distinction through the engagements with the
Barbary corsairs, the Quasi War with France and the War of 1812.
She was commanded by some of the most notable names in US naval
history, such as Stephan Decatur, Isaac Hull and James Lawrence (of
&ldquo;Don't give up the ship&rdquo; fame). Michael Bosworth writes that
&ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Enterprize</em></span>, in her original schooner rig,
had a reputation of being fast, and she was remarkably lucky in her
assignments, her timely refits and her officers and crew.&rdquo; When
the time came in 1803 to build more naval schooners, it was hoped
that the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Enterprize</em></span> could serve as a model.
But alas, no <span   class="emphasis"><em>Enterprize</em></span> plans were to be
found, and the schooner, while lucky in her own right, could not be
reproduced. Her career was a collection of serendipitous and
fortuitous events that entice one to believe she was fated to
succeed.
</p><p>Despite the hard work of thousands, the point where Linux now
sits can similarly be considered a lucky or fated enterprise,
especially when one considers the role initially played in that
success simply by the personality of Linus Torvalds. But now Linux
seems to be at a juncture. The initial hype and excitement are
gone, the bandwagon jumpers-on are gone, and it's time to see
whether Linux can continue its maturation rate and present a viable
solution to an ever-increasing variety of applications.</p><p>While it's important not to forget the many improvements yet
to be made to Linux, I like the attitude in David Bandel's column
this month&mdash;that the existence of many large companies using Linux
is proof that it is ready for the enterprise. Our article on Bike
Friday and their move from Microsoft to Linux supports this, and
this month's Linux Bytes Other Markets highlighting a manufacturing
firm that uses Linux for everything, including every employee's
desktop, is another drop in the bucket of evidence that this player
is ready for prime time.</p><p>As a side note, plans for a ship believed to be the schooner
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Enterprise</em></span> were recently found in Venice. The
plans are being used to construct a replica in Washington, DC that
will be used as an educational ship and goodwill ambassador.</p></div></div>
