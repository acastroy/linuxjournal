a Blue Fade</h2></div></div><p>As more companies dive into open-source business systems,
many are building web-to-back-end stacks that typically include
Linux, PHP, Apache web server and an open-source database, usually
either MySQL or PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is gaining favor of late in
many quarters, having reached, some say, a critical mass of
functionality and stability. Several high-profile companies now
provide 24/7 support, including Red Hat. This article shows what to
expect when switching from Microsoft Access to an open-source
database (in this case, BSD-style licensed PostgreSQL).</p><p>Michael Calabrese, manager of information systems for Bike
Friday, recently undertook the challenge. Bike Friday is a rapidly
expanding touring and mountain bike company based in Eugene,
Oregon. It uses PostgreSQL to handle all of its sales,
manufacturing and customer support data. Calabrese is also in the
midst of changing all of the company's e-commerce systems from
proprietary to open-source&mdash;Linux and Apache, with PostgreSQL at
the core. For now, however, he has retained Microsoft Access 97 as
the front end in order to minimize downtime while replacing the
back end with PostgreSQL and adding new features. Calabrese
says:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>If you're not dealing with preserving an existing
front end, life is easy. Just run the conversion scripts [detailed
below] and start writing a new front end. If you have an Access
front end that you can continue to use with a PostgreSQL back end,
you've provided clear pathways for things to grow, without trying
to convert the whole system at once. In the first scenario, you'd
be looking at a year for the conversion after freezing the whole
front end. Attacking the change incrementally allows you to start
designing new things with the choice of whether to do it in Access
or PostgreSQL.</p></blockquote></div><p>Calabrese decided to move to PostgreSQL because it is the
more enterprise-capable system. It has a mature
transaction-management system with a sophisticated data-locking
mechanism called multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), which
allows read-only access to data even if it's in use.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xee0580.0xfd8ad8"></a>Tools of the Trade</h2></div></div><p>Loading the Microsoft open database connectivity (ODBC)
drivers onto the PostgreSQL template database lets Access and
PostgreSQL set up house together. Besides basic conversion tools
(see Resources), additional ODBC server-side functions that Access
sometimes needs to run psql &lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>database
name</em></span>&gt; &lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>odbc.sql</em></span>&gt; are
located in the directory src/interfaces/odbc/odbc.sql. PostgreSQL
also provides a platform-independent Type 4 Java database
connectivity interface (JDBC) driver. An embedded interface for C
(ECPG) is also part of PostgreSQL. Once the installation was
finished, Calabrese chose data migration tools like pgAccess,
available in Windows and UNIX versions, and exSQL public version
3.1.</p><p>After backing up existing databases using the included tools
(either the pg_dumpall utility or a combination of the pg_dump and
pg_dumpaccounts utilities) and running the Installer, the first
step in the data conversion is to hunt down illegal file names in
Access. Access is quite liberal in its allowance of illegal
characters that other databases&mdash;Oracle, Sybase and PostgreSQL
included&mdash;will not understand. Therefore, scores of illegal terms
for Bike Friday's shipping and ordering data that Access thought
were fine had to be converted for PostgreSQL. For example, tables
like Order Detail needed to become Order_Detail or OrderDetail, and
field names such as Shipped? had to become Shipped or
ShippedYN.</p><p>The basic conversion tools will remove all illegal characters
automatically. This can be problematic for those working with an
existing front end, because the front and back ends can cease
communicating without an apparent reason. Calabrese recommends that
anyone planning to preserve an existing front end should not change
the names containing illegal characters in the front-end data or,
alternatively, make parallel changes manually. In his situation,
Calabrese found himself manually changing characters one by one on
Bike Friday's front and back ends, which was okay since he was
going to have to change the front end anyway. Either way, it's at
this point that one should perform the first of many tests to be
sure everything works. With illegal character issues resolved, the
data is ready for conversion.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xee0580.0xfd8d40"></a>Converting the Data</h2></div></div><p>For those planning to run an Access front end atop a
converted back end, pgAdmin should do an adequate job of moving the
data automatically. Calabrese also used a modified version of exSQL
to define how Access and PostgreSQL would handle relationships
between tables. The version he has made public at
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/musica_6898/postgresaccess_home.html" target="_self">www.geocities.com/musica_6898/
postgresaccess_home.html</a> runs a script that alters
field-type conversion for several tasks, such as regulating how
Access handles the money type. Bike Friday's Access front end saw
PostgreSQL's numeric decimal fields as text fields. In order for
Access to view the math properly, Calabrese changed the fields to a
Float4&mdash;the method by which PostgreSQL describes a four-byte
floating number&mdash;allowing Access to read them properly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xee0580.0xfd8ea0"></a>Testing the Front End</h2></div></div><p>With more than 100 tables, Bike Friday's interface is fairly
complex. Viewed from the user end, Bike Friday uses more than 80
screens for everything from entering an order, viewing a parts
table, to scheduling production and tracking inventory. Therefore,
Calabrese had to be sure that the system scaled for tens of users.
Testing took several weeks, redesigning SQL queries as needed along
the way, either by rewriting them on the Access side or, when that
proved problematic, rewriting them on the back end until they ran
at speed. Listings 1 and 2 illustrate the difference in typical
queries and queries optimized for speed.</p><p><a href="5416l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. A Fairly Inefficient
Query</a></p><p><a href="5416l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. The Same Query Optimized
for Speed</a></p><p>Generally one optimizes PostgreSQL queries using SQL commands
such as Create index, vacuum, vacuum analyze, cluster and explain.
However, Calabrese offers this warning: Access 97 took the liberty
of changing his queries based on how it thought they would be more
efficient. Calabrese headed this off by using a pass-through query
that told Access not to touch the query but send it straight to
back end.</p><p>In the optimization he did for Bike Friday's PostgreSQL
database, Calabrese scored most of his speed gains by extracting
smaller, more exact amounts of data. Instead of the database
querying 100,000 product order details at once, he told it to only
look at the orders using some 2,000 details instead. &ldquo;Access is
greedy&rdquo;, Calabrese said. &ldquo;It grabs all the records and goes
through them every time. That's very inefficient. We have 30 people
with the company now, and if each has a computer accessing the
database, that's going to be problem real fast in terms of
speed.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xee0580.0xfd91b8"></a>Troubleshooting PostgreSQL</h2></div></div><p>The next stage in the changeover is debugging queries, and
there are two basic routes here. The first is to activate and use
the debugging tools in the ODBC driver for PostgreSQL. One can have
the driver create a log so that whenever Access sends an SQL
command, PostgreSQL puts it into the log, which is written to the
root of the C drive. This will catch Access in the act if it tries
to retrieve something like 100,000 rows or otherwise butcher a
query and, for example, break it into a thousand smaller ones.
Basically, it's an audit trail that makes it easier to catch
haywire queries and rewrite them if something goes wrong, as it did
here:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
conn=86311032, query=' '
CONN ERROR: func=SQLDriverConnect,
desc='Error from CC_Connect',
errnum=105, errmsg='The database does not exist
on the server or user authentication failed.'
</pre><p>Alternately, if Access is sending a query and the system
hangs, one can change the debug level on the server side to read
the queries being sent to it. Fine tuning is a matter of going
through each screen and testing them to ensure they're all up to
speed by simplifying queries, making them faster or combining them.
This process sounds easy but isn't, considering how esoteric some
SQL lore can be. But, running two or three complete alpha tests at
this point is going to save grief later.
</p><p>The next step before putting the whole thing into production
is to beta test it. Calabrese monitored Bike Friday's back-end
system while salespeople, executives and associates used it in real
time. &ldquo;You're not just testing whether the front end has errors,
but how big you need to make the server&rdquo;, Calabrese said. He wrote
a query script that kept close watch on the three main bottlenecks
(CPU, the disk and the network) to see what loads they were
taking.</p><p>For hardware tweaking (CPU, disks and memory), Bruce
Momjian's <i  >Linux Journal</i> article &ldquo;PostgreSQL
Performance Tuning&rdquo; (August 2001 issue and also accessible on-line
at
<a href="../088/4791.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/lj-issues/issue88/4791.html</a>
) provides a handy overview. Calabrese's script measured CPU stress
based on how many seconds the load remained at 100%, 50% and idle.
It looked at disk transfers in terms of the number of reads and
writes to and from the disk, as well as the amount in kilobytes of
those reads and writes. As for the network rate, Calabrese's script
counted packets per second and bytes per second. Calabrese also
suggested doing a ping/F on an isolated network, a flood ping that
will indicate how much the server can take before it maxes. As far
as memory goes, the more you have, the more data PostgreSQL will
load into it and the faster the database will be.</p><p>Of course, the only way really to determine if a database is
fast enough is whether or not the people using it feel it is fast
enough. Fractional waits that seem insignificant on paper can be
much longer in real time. Each organization will have its own
tolerance level for speed and performance. The only way to be sure
the database is working the way the organization wants it to is to
let people use it and listen to what they say.</p><p>Finally, once you've gone through a few production tests,
having listed and cleaned up all the errors in the interface,
you're ready to roll out an open-source foundation for a
real-world, enterprise e-business.</p><p><a href="5416s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
