    If you think Linux isn't ready for the enterprise, thinkagain. Linux in the enterprise is alive and growing.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x155a580.0x1652608"></a></h2></div></div><p>I'm continually surprised at the folks
who (with an air of authority) declare Linux is not ready for the
enterprise. These are people who should know better. I told you
several months ago that Linux was, in fact, ready for the desktop.
True, there are some areas where Linux is still weak. But I think
some folks are judging Linux from a whole different set of
standards than they use for other operating systems. I submit that
the Burlington Coat Factory, McDonald's and Largo City success
stories prove that Linux is ready. And with over 400 Largo City
desktops running Linux, with a savings of over $3,000,000 US, and
the secretaries loving it, folks need to start examining why
they're fighting it so fiercely. Linux in the enterprise is alive
and well and growing, with many happy users. The absurd claim that
when those who put it together are gone no one will understand, it
is wishful thinking. I will bet most anyone reading this, given one
or two hours (or less) going over the configuration files in /etc,
would understand everything going on. So don't ask why, ask why
not.
</p><p>MySQL Navigator
<a href="http://sql.kldp.org/mysql" target="_self">sql.kldp.org/mysql</a></p><p>If you find you need a powerful graphical tool to do serious
MySQL work, then MySQL Navigator may be just what you need. This
application rivals, and maybe even betters, PHPMySQL. And if you
don't have access to Apache with PHP and MySQL support, then this
is definitely what you need. Requires: libmysqlui (included),
libqt2, libXext, libX11, libstdc++, libm, glibc, libmysqlclient,
libSM, libICE, libpng, libz, libjpeg, libmng, licvrypt,
libnsl.</p><p>Mindi
<a href="http://www.microwerks.net/~hugo/mindi/index.html" target="_self">www.microwerks.net/~hugo/mindi/index.html</a></p><p>A number of recovery CDs have been appearing, but this one is
created from your running system. While Mindi is comparable to
several other offerings, it is quick, easy to use and worth a look.
Its minimal requirements make it perfect for almost any system,
including one that doesn't have its own CD burner&mdash;just transfer
the ISO image to a system that does. Requires: sh.</p><p>Mondo
<a href="http://www.microwerks.net/~hugo" target="_self">www.microwerks.net/~hugo</a></p><p>If you need more than just a boot CD-ROM, Mondo extends Mindi
and creates a backup of your entire system. It first creates a
Mindi ISO, then calculates and creates a backup of your entire
system that is easy to restore. Those of you comfortable with afio
will probably like this backup system, which is another good tool
to consider for your backups if you use a CD burner rather than
tapes. Requires: Mindi, afio.</p><p>tcptraceroute
<a href="http://michael.toren.net/code/tcptraceroute" target="_self">michael.toren.net/code/tcptraceroute</a></p><p>Ever had a problem where you needed to trace all the way to a
server but that server was behind a firewall that dropped standard
traceroute packets? Well, if that server is running services
accessible from the Internet, you can use tcptraceroute to go right
through the firewall to the server. Just specify the port (by
default, tcptraceroute uses port 80), and the firewall won't know
the difference. Requires: libpcap, libnet, glibc.</p><p>iCE Breakers Log Monitor
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/iblm" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/iblm</a></p><p>I've tried a number of different tools to keep an eye on
certain logs as events happen, but this one is by far the best one
I've seen. Just tell the dotrc file which logs to watch for you
(you'll obviously need permissions to read these files), and you
can watch any one by selecting its tab. As messages come in, if
they don't come in to the tabbed box on top, the lettering on the
tab changes to bold to alert you of a new message. A great tool for
troubleshooting. Requires: libgtk, libgdk, libgmodule, libglib,
libdl, libXext, libX11, libm, glibc.</p><p>WebHost Billing System
<a href="http://www.tolchz.net" target="_self">www.tolchz.net</a></p><p>Granted, not many will have a need for this, but if you bill
a lot of customers monthly, you might want to give this a try. It's
particularly good if billings go out on a daily basis. Just select
the customers to bill and off it goes, tracking who's been billed
what and when. Requires: MySQL, PHP4 with MySQL, web server, web
browser.</p><p>FAQ-O-Matic
<a href="http://faqomatic.sourceforge.net" target="_self">faqomatic.sourceforge.net</a></p><p>I don't know if you've ever tried to manage a FAQ, but it can
be a challenge. Well, the FAQ-O-Matic won't do it for you, but it
does make it easier to maintain. It's all done from a web
interface, so it's relatively painless and easy. Installation is a
breeze. In true Perl fashion, this little utility runs you through
the entire process, checking off boxes for you as you go. Requires:
Perl.</p><p>toolbox
<a href="http://movingparts.windsofstorm.net/code.shtml#toolbox" target="_self">movingparts.windsofstorm.net/code.shtml#toolbox</a></p><p>I realize that only a very few of you out there run the
Blackbox window manager. But for those of you that do, toolbox can
help you customize your Blackbox setup easily. While I'm sure
Blackbox users are more comfortable with ASCII configuration files
than the average KDE user, the styles are more easily modified via
a graphical interface. At least, that's how I see it. Requires:
libqt (v2), libXext, libX11, libstdc++, libm, libSM, libICE,
libpng, libz, libjpeg, libmng, glibc.</p><p>Until next month.</p></div></div>
