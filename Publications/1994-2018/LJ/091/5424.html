    Testing may not be fun, but it's important; Open SourceDevelopment Lab and Scalable Test Platform want to help.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x228d580.0x23856b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Open Source Development Lab (OSDL) is
a nonprofit company working to enhance Linux scalability and telco
capabilities. OSDL sponsors
(<a href="http://www.osdlab.org/sponsors" target="_self">www.osdlab.org/sponsors</a>)
have financed a full-scale test and development lab, complete with
terabytes of storage and an array of SMP servers with anywhere from
2 to 16 CPUs. At the lab we provide developers with full access to
enterprise-class machines via remote login.
</p><p>We have been working with developers on the creation and
execution of their tests. During this process, we have noticed a
number of things that have to be done again and again for each test
that comes through the lab. We listed the tasks that went into
running an average test sequence and found a great deal of the
process involved human interaction that could be automated. The
Scalable Test Platform (STP) is the result of our attempt to
automate the testing process from request to report.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x228d580.0x2385870"></a>Problems with Testing Methods</h2></div></div><p>Benchmarking itself has inherent concept problems that are
outside both the scope of this article and the scope of the
Scalable Test Platform effort. There are, however, solvable
problems with current testing practices, and that is what the STP
attempts to address. Please keep in mind, the benchmarking we focus
on is completely different from methods used to get marketable
benchmark numbers.</p><p>The configuration of a testing environment is rarely as well
documented as it should be. Documentation on the setup of systems
used in tests is usually limited to what the tester believes is
relevant to their specific research goals. This lack of detail will
cause problems later on, when other analysts are examining the
report. It is not uncommon for an analyst to have to duplicate an
entire test sequence to get the data required to answer questions
that come up later. It is also common practice for a testing setup
to be only partially automated. The resulting human interaction at
undocumented moments will also affect the repeatability of the
results.</p><p>Performance testing can require massive resources, both in
the form of time and hardware. How many open-source developers can
get access to 50 two-way client servers on a gigabit network in
order to test a server farm made up of multiple 8-CPU servers and a
16-CPU server? Few companies would stretch to provide access to
hardware like that and then only with a full entourage of managers
and the potential revenue return to justify the expense. A good
idea conceived by a developer without access to hardware like this
is likely to remain unexplored.</p><p>Currently no central archive exists of well-documented
results for performance, stability and standard compliance tests.
Researchers are forced to run their own tests or pick and choose
from mediocre results to come up with a less-than-accurate guess.
System administrators have no central place to look for starter
information on what combination of kernel, distribution and
hardware tends to work well for a workload similar to what they
anticipate. This lack of available research leads to confusion
regarding the performance and reliability among the myriad of Linux
choices.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x228d580.0x2385a80"></a>Linux Kernel Development</h2></div></div><p>Linux kernel developers cannot spend the time and effort
required to run long performance and stability tests on their
patches. Even if a developer is willing to spend the time testing a
patch, testing software often requires a great deal of knowledge
and specialized hardware just to install and configure.
Occasionally this situation leads to problems being introduced into
both the stable and development kernel trees. It also can allow
problems solved previously to recur in future development but go
unnoticed because of a lack of regression testing.</p><p>A number of developers have spoken up on the Linux kernel
mailing list requesting a standard testing procedure for new
patches. Many users and developers agree that a simple procedure,
including performance, stability, standards compliance and
regression testing, would benefit Linux kernel development.</p><p>While you can't test for every bug out there, you can check
for common types of problems. It's generally not too difficult to
add a regression test case to your testing suite after a bug is
found and fixed. The problem is not in the creation of these tests.
Most developers realize that it's a good idea to have a few
synthetic tests available and very often do so. The problem is that
most developers can't or won't take the time to configure a full
range of verification tests. While coding can be fun, testing is
often quite boring. If a developer could easily request a full test
of their code and then continue working while someone else does the
dirty work, we think they would be more inclined to attempt
verification runs on their patches.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x228d580.0x2385c38"></a>The Scalable Test Platform</h2></div></div><p>The STP is a hardware and software configuration for
automated testing. To run the back-end control and scripting of the
tests, we developed Brimstone, a combined batch control system and
automated test harness. Requests are submitted using Eidetic, a
user-friendly web front end, or brim-gate, the e-mail gateway.
Using these front ends, entire test sequences can be requested in
less than two minutes.</p><p>How STP works begins with developers checking patches in to
our kernel CVS tree and requesting a test sequence using their
patch. After the tests are completed, detailed results are returned
to the developer via e-mail and are also archived on our web site.
To simplify the process even further, a developer could write a
short shell script that, in less than five lines, would check their
patch into CVS and submit a preformatted test request via e-mail.
Then all it would take to check the effectiveness of their patch
would be a single command. Everything involved in a full-scale test
run would then be taken care of without a second thought.</p><p>The hardware dedicated to the STP by the OSDL includes a
1.8TB storage away network setup connected to each server (four-CPU
and up), via multiple Fibre Channel connections. Servers include
two each of 2-CPU, 4-CPU and 8-CPU boxes, as well as a single
16-CPU IBM NUMA-Q server. A second 16-CPU NEC AzusA server,
containing Itanium CPUs, is on order. We also have over 50
client-load machines that can be moved into the STP at the press of
a key. We are also looking into the possibility of including a few
single-CPU machines to ensure kernel modifications don't adversely
affect the vast majority of current installs.</p><p>Eidetic, Brimstone and the e-mail gateway are all under the
GPL, so interested parties can use them when setting up their own
labs for specialized testing interests.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x228d580.0x2385e48"></a>Requesting a Test Run</h2></div></div><p>The first step is to go through the free sign-up to become an
OSDL Lab Associate, available at
<a href="http://www.osdlab.org" target="_self">www.osdlab.org</a>. Next,
enter a test request through the web page, which will involve
something like this: choose the kernel tag to run (2.4.8 for
instance), choose the distribution to use, choose the test to run,
list the CPU details, list the various hardware restrictions
(optional) and enter an optional LILO command line (allows for
restriction on the RAM used). After submitting the base items, you
need to spend a moment filling out the setup page for the test you
selected, then submit the final request.</p><p>It's as simple as that. Depending on the length of time
required to complete the type of test requested, you could have
your response back in less than 25 minutes. Full environment
documentation and the resulting data sets will be archived on the
web site for you. Short tests will take at least 15 minutes because
a fresh copy of the OS is installed prior to every test
sequence.</p><p>Since the entire process is automated, testing does not stop
when our office closes. This means the quick response will be
possible at any time, for developers located anywhere in the
world.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x228d580.0x2386058"></a>Test Details</h2></div></div><p>Since the STP is currently in the initial rollout phase, the
number of scripted tests is still low. At the time of this writing,
the following is a sample list of possible workloads: Juan
Quitela's &ldquo;memtest&rdquo; VM abuse test suite, dbench (Samba)
filesystem punishment, the ever-popular scripted kernel compile,
simulated real-world CVS punishment and lmbench.</p><p>A long list of potential tests including scenarios involving
multiple servers and applications such as Apache and MySQL is
currently being evaluated. Of course, as an open-source project, we
welcome assistance in the automation of these tests. Getting a full
range of tests ready for use with the STP is going to be a major
undertaking, but we believe the benefits to Linux will be worth it.
For me personally, this is where I hope to give something back to
the Linux community that will make a positive impact.</p><p>We are also in active cooperation with developers from SGI
and IBM in the Linux Test Project (LTP). One current goal is to
enlarge the LTP's coverage to include both targeted and general
workload simulation tests. The LTP kernel features test is almost
ready to be automated, which will provide us with a large
regression test suite, as well as a solid base for stability
research. The LTP's future plans include the development of a
number of self-contained tests that will make great testing targets
for the STP.</p></div></div>
