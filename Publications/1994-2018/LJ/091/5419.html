telemarketing company. My job involved building and managing very
large databases, primarily for the purpose of target marketing. We
were spending an arm and a leg on software licenses in the R&amp;D
shop and another arm and leg on additional software elsewhere in
the company. Although we did some things well, our expensive
software was still not providing managers with the information
necessary to make sound business decisions. For example, we were
too late with information on profitable and nonprofitable
campaigns, and we never did have good data on cash flow. I left
that company after our R&amp;D office was closed, disappointed that
some good work went down the drain. I was also frustrated by the
lack of software solutions for the company's basic business
problems&mdash;and with just a hint of understanding of the board's
unhappiness with how much our software licenses were
costing.</p><p>After a few months of private consulting in database design,
I was invited to a job interview by the CEO of a medium-sized
manufacturing company named Action Target. (Action Target is in the
business of manufacturing and installing target equipment and
shooting ranges.) I was shocked at what I discovered. The CEO (an
electrical engineer with an entrepreneurial bent) had the whole
place running on Linux. Every single user, from sales, shipping and
purchasing to production, engineering and accounting, worked on a
Linux workstation, most of which were diskless. These workstations
were served from a group of servers, which included a web server, a
database server and collection of application servers. The
application servers hosted all home directories in addition to the
applications. The applications were mostly of the open-source or
free variety, such as StarOffice, Netscape and TGIF, but also
included a few proprietary applications, like Applix. The database
server hosted PostgreSQL. Networking was accomplished via NFS
between the servers, and the diskless machines were networked via
bootp to the application servers.</p><p>What I discovered next shocked me even more. Not only was the
whole place running Linux, but the CEO had written his own ERP
(enterprise resource planning) application. He told me that he had
investigated several other solutions, but they were all expensive,
ran on expensive and proprietary RDBMSes and, most importantly, did
not permit full customization. Therefore, he explained, he decided
to write his own. The front-end tool he chose was Wylib, which he
had coded. Wylib is a group of libraries written using Tcl/Tk.
Tcl/Tk is easy to use, platform-independent, can act as a shell and
belongs to and is widely accepted in the Open Source community. For
the back-end RDBMS, he selected PostgreSQL.</p><p>This customized ERP system runs the company. Employees use
the system because they can't do their jobs without it. The ERP is
based on open-source software and is fully customizable. In order
words, if we're not happy with it, we change it. Management
estimates that this system has saved the company over $1 million
(US) in operation expenses, not to mention the huge savings in
software licensing.</p><p>After working at this company for a year, recoding the ERP
using Wylib and restructuring the database, I've been spun off into
my own company, WyattERP. WyattERP's mission is twofold: 1) to show
companies how to save money by using open-source software and 2) to
show companies how to create an ERP solution using Wylib that is
inexpensive and completely suited to the needs of the
business.</p><p>Wylib and the sample code can be downloaded from the web
site,
<a href="http://www.wyatt-erp.com" target="_self">www.wyatt-erp.com</a>.
Wylib is open source and distributed under the OPL (Open Public
License) agreement. I can be contacted via e-mail through the web
site.</p><p>&mdash;Merrill Oveson</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xec0580.0xfb8500"></a>Optimistic Signs for Embedded Linux</h2></div></div><p>It's no news that Linux is finding a home in everything
&ldquo;from household appliances and consumer electronics gadgets to
controllers used in aviation, factories and
automobiles&mdash;application-specific devices&rdquo;, as Evans Data
Corporation
(<a href="http://www.evansdata.com" target="_self">www.evansdata.com</a>)
reports. But it is news to discover how high the Linux embedding
rate appears to be among those many devices.</p><p>In its &ldquo;Embedded Systems Developer Survey&rdquo;, Evans Data
reports what it calls &ldquo;a dramatic change in the software content
of the microprocessor-controlled devices in the workplace and in
our homes&rdquo;. As a result, the firm predicts a triple increase in
Linux-based projects over the next year, which it says is &ldquo;part of
a shift toward commercially available operating systems rather than
those developed in-house.&rdquo;</p><p>Tools are an issue. Without giving numbers, the study showed
&ldquo;keen interest in tools and products that can help developers get
their projects completed correctly and on time&rdquo;. Two-thirds of the
surveyed developers said many embedded projects are started and
never completed, and many more are delivered late.</p><p>What is it that developers like about Linux? Just what you'd
expect: &ldquo;Open-source code, royalty-free licensing and a large
community of knowledgeable developers were cited as Linux's key
benefits.&rdquo; On the down side, Evans Data reports, &ldquo;Factors slowing
Linux adoption include lack of specific board support packages,
availability of device drivers and fragmentation of the code
base.&rdquo;</p><p>

buying Compaq for $25 billion (US) in stock. After both stocks were
hit the next day, the deal was worth about $20 billion&mdash;even though
the announcement boasted that the combined company &ldquo;Will Have
Number One Worldwide Positions In Servers, PCs and Hand-helds, and
Imaging and Printing; Leading Positions In IT Services, Storage,
Management Software.&rdquo;</p><p>The numbers involved were staggering. Combined revenues
exceeded $87 billion over the past four quarters, which would place
the new HP second only to IBM ($90 billion) in size. The new
behemoth would also have 145,000 employees in 160 countries&mdash;prior
to staff cuts, which are sure to come mostly at Compaq's expense.
If the deal goes through, Compaq as a company will only persist, in
the manner of Netscape after AOL, as a &ldquo;brand&rdquo;. Together HP and
Compaq brands account for about 70% of PC sales through retail
outlets; but Dell now leads in sales overall, having moved ahead of
both HP and Compaq. This, pundits mostly agreed, was clearly one
strong motive for the deal.</p><p>Reviews in the mainstream media were mixed at best. Dan
Gillmor of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>San Jose Mercury News</em></span> wrote,
&ldquo;It's hardly thrilling to be the leader in a market that is dull,
nearly devoid of innovation and barely profitable.&rdquo; In the UK,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Register</em></span> wrote:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>A braver choice for HP would have been to prise
its way into new infrastructure partnerships, swallowing a Nokia or
a Nortel. Or even an ARM. But instead of looking forward, HP has
looked back and fallen on an acquisition target that looks
agreeably like itself only financially weaker.</p></blockquote></div><p>But in the Linux community, the mood was more upbeat.
Linuxcare cofounder Dave Sifry said, &ldquo;Gee, everyone said that
there'd be consolidation in the Linux space, but this is a bit
bigger than I expected!&rdquo;
</p><p>Dan Kusnetsky, VP System Software for International Data
Corp. and one of the leading Linux analysts, says:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>In the recent past both companies have been
looking for ways to lower their overall software development costs
by moving to high-volume, third-party software. This is quite
reasonable. It is quite expensive to be a world-class supplier of
operating systems.</p></blockquote></div><p>He adds that the combined company would be supporting as many
as eight different OSes, and offers these predictions: 1) since
Tru64 UNIX is the lower-volume product and is tied to Alpha, the
best features of Tru64 UNIX will be merged into HP-UX and Linux,
and then Tru64 UNIX will be retired; 2) the best features of
OpenVMS and MPE/ix will be merged into Windows and then one or both
of those operating systems will be retired; and 3) the combined
company will focus on HP-UX for high-end enterprise tasks, Windows
for workgroup and desktop tasks, and Linux for Web-centric
computing tasks.
