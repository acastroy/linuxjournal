    Keeping up with large volumes of research requires a systemboth flexible and intuitive.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a1580.0x2799608"></a></h2></div></div><p>Research has always been an integral part
of education, especially higher education. Research generates new
knowledge and offers training in creative and independent thinking.
The role of research in higher education is shown by the fact that
almost all the famous universities in the world are also known as
research universities.
</p><p>Modern research is highly specialized and highly
collaborative. Finding papers with more than 100 references is
common these days. Moreover, the rise of the Internet has made it
possible to publish results quickly, and the barrier to accessing
scientific information has been lowered drastically. For instance,
in the astrophysics field alone, its internet preprint service
publishes more than 15 new research papers every day, all of which
are freely accessible to the public. While this provides enormous
power for researchers to conduct advanced research, it also creates
a huge burden to keep up-to-date with the newest results.</p><p>These conditions give rise to two important questions in
modern research: how do we organize knowledge to keep in step with
recent developments and be able to retrieve the information when we
need it? Second, how do we organize and keep record of research
projects involving several researchers? In the research world, new
knowledge is presented in the form of publications. I use the term
&ldquo;references&rdquo; to refer to pieces of knowledge, including
unpublished or privately communicated tips and results. In this
article, I discuss research knowledge-base systems in the form of
reference management systems.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a1580.0x27997c0"></a>Why We Need New Software</h2></div></div><p>There have been commercial attempts to address the questions
above. Applications like EndNote, Pro-Cite and PAPYRUS offer
reference management capabilities and even some web capabilities.
However, I found them hard to use and customize in my own
research.</p><p>Research covers every field of human knowledge, and more
importantly, research is intended to explore the unexpected. Every
group might have different requirements for organizing and
displaying their references. Most of the proprietary reference
management systems have targeted specific research fields (usually
medical research). Being closed-source software, it is impossible
for the user to change and improve the software to adapt to
specific needs.</p><p>The best solution to this problem is to design an
open-source, web-based, multi-user knowledge-base system. It would
run on an internet-connected server and be accessible from any
standard web browser, from all platforms. Users could post/organize
references and hold discussions in the comment section. All the
knowledge and discussion interactions could be archived centrally
from one secured server. This web-based approach would use web
browsers as the user interface (UI) and would enable anyone to
change the UI by simply changing the HTML-like source code. My
answer to the need for such software is the OpenReference reference
management system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a1580.0x2799978"></a>Goals and Required Features</h2></div></div><p>One goal for writing this software was to categorize
knowledge for easy future retrieval by multiple users. A simple
keyword search is not enough, since searching cannot guarantee
finding all the related references. It is much easier to browse
through the category tree if you have a specific subject in mind.
So, advanced categories and user management are two core features I
decided to implement.</p><p>Big categories, each containing hundreds of references, are
no better than no category at all. For the categorization to be
useful, the leaf categories on the tree should contain less than
one page or 20 references each. That demands a very fine-tuned
category structure. Finer categories are needed in areas of more
active research. It is impossible, however, to judge in advance how
many levels of subcategories are needed in any field so as to make
efficient categorization. The only way is to design a dynamic
category structure that can be adjusted at runtime. If a lot of
references show up in a particular category, the administrator can
divide it into several subcategories, according to the nature of
those references.</p><p>As I have stated, the leaf categories need to focus on narrow
subjects to keep the number of references small. Today's research
works have become more and more interdisciplinary, making it hard
to categorize a reference into a narrow category. The solution to
this problem is to allow a reference to associate with more than
one category.</p><p>This system is designed not only as a personal reference
organizer, but also as a group discussion server to exchange ideas
in the comments section. A web-based collaboration system can keep
track of information and make archives of idea exchanges
possible.</p><p>Being a multi-user system, this software must establish some
user access control. The administrator can set the policy to accept
new users. Every user needs to log in with a legitimate
username/password combination to post references and comments. Each
user can edit/delete/recategorize his or her own postings. Only the
administrator can touch the category structure.</p><p>Finally, in order to enable private conversation in the
forum, I also allow a user to specify a list of other users who can
see her or his postings. Those private conversations traditionally
take place in e-mail communications, but this software encourages
users to use the web system for better archiving of the research
effort.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a1580.0x2799c38"></a>Database</h2></div></div><p>The back end of the system is naturally a relational database
management system (RDBMS). Most of the data we want to
store/retrieve/search is textual, and RDBMS is perfect for this
purpose. Any SQL-enabled database server will work, and there are
many such servers to choose from. I chose the GPLed MySQL for its
speed and reliability. If data integrity and transaction support is
a must for you, you can choose the open-source PostgreSQL database
server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a1580.0x2799d40"></a>Middleware</h2></div></div><p>The middleware is a collection of classes/methods that wrap
the data query operations. They are designed to shield front-end
developers from the technical details of database connections and
SQL language.</p><p>I chose to use Java to develop the middleware. One big
advantage of using Java is that it is a full-blown, object-oriented
language, making it much easier to implement complex
logic/structure designs required by large projects. Using Java also
allows us to take advantage of a large number of utility classes
already existing as Java libraries or beans. The ones I used for
this project include JDBC driver, database connection pool, session
management and text processing.</p><p>The standard way to build database middleware in J2EE is to
use entity EJBs (Enterprise JavaBeans). However, this approach
requires running an EJB container, which can be expensive. In fact,
few low-cost JSP hosting services provide EJB containers. For
OpenReference's relatively simple database structure, I decided to
use a simpler approach: static methods in helper classes to provide
database access. Each row in a table is represented by a
HashTable.</p><p>The middleware uses JDBC to pass information between the Java
application and the SQL database. There are JDBC drivers for all
the major RDBMSes. For MySQL, I used the mm.mysql driver. I
constructed one class for each database table. The class knows the
fields in that table and knows which fields are searchable. Each
class implements a set of basic data query functions (e.g.,
getAllRows, AddRow, updateRows, etc.) and a search function that
searches all the searchable fields and returns all the matched
rows. Each class also has its own query functions to do specific or
cross-table queries. For example, in the ReferenceTable.java class,
there is a function getReferencesByUserName. This will take the
user name as input and find the corresponding user ID in the User
table, and then return the rows with matching user ID from the
Reference table. As an example, see Listing 1 [available at
<a href="../listings/091/4769.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue91/4769.tgz</a>]
for the complete API for the Category class.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a1580.0x2799fa8"></a>Front End</h2></div></div><p>I chose JavaServer Pages (JSPs) for the front end. JSPs have
the power of the full Java language plus the benefit of separating
the web presentation from the application functions. JSPs support
all the HTML tag syntax for formatting display, and one can add
whole Java programs dealing with beans and other functions in HTML
comments. One can even design custom tags to encapsulate the
back-end operations (e.g., database queries). It is easy to train
an HTML programmer/presentation expert to work on the web pages
using their favorite HTML editor, without caring about how the
database queries are executed. In the meantime, a back-end
programmer can work on the data query part without caring about how
the data will be displayed. More information about JSPs can be
found in Reuven Lerner's At the Forge column in the May through
July 2001 issues of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>Any J2EE-compatible Java server is capable of running JSPs.
My favorites are the Tomcat engine from the Apache Foundation and
the Resin engine from Caucho Technology. Either one of them can run
as an extension module of the Apache web server to take advantage
of many other useful features of Apache. Tomcat is released under
GPL. Resin is closed-source software but is free for noncommercial
use. Resin runs considerably faster than Tomcat and offers some
useful features, such as a built-in JDBC driver and driver pool and
multiple JVM for fallback.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a1580.0x279a160"></a>Dynamic Category Tree</h2></div></div><p>Originally I planned to use an XML file to represent the
category structure because XML documents are naturally organized in
a tree structure (DOM model), and they are easy for human reading
and editing. There are many good XML-DOM tools in Java to
manipulate trees.</p><p>However, we need a large and dynamic category structure for
accurate classification and browsing, as it is important to be able
to search the categories. One drawback of using XML is its
difficulty to be searched together with other content stored in
RDBMS. Also, to store a big parsed DOM object in memory constantly
is inefficient and difficult to synchronize among several JVMs. To
store it on disk and parse it when needed introduces too much
processing overhead. So, I decided to use database tables for the
categories.</p><p>The whole category is stored in a database table. Each record
represents a category and has its unique category ID. It also has
the parent category ID so that the records are linked together into
a tree. References are linked to the categories by a separate
category ID vs. reference ID table.</p><p>The Category class in middleware contains all methods to
operate the tree. In order to maintain the links and structure
integrity of the category table, it is important that we manipulate
the category table only through the Category object public methods.
Some important methods include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Insert new subcategories in or between any level(s)
in the tree. A special note about adding a new subcategory under a
leaf category: since all references must be associated with leaves
only, references that were associated with the old leaf become
associated with the new subcategory now.</p></li><li><p>Change category
description/keywords/properties.</p></li><li><p>Delete a category from any level in the tree to
make the target category's children be children of its parent and
then delete the target itself from the table.</p></li><li><p>Return a list of children (or parent) for a given
category.</p></li><li><p>Search keywords from category descriptions.</p></li></ul></div><p>An illustrative listing of Category-class source code is
presented in Listing 1. I found those methods sufficient for my
use. You might want to do more complicated operations, such as
moving a subtree to another branch, etc. The strength of
open-source software is that anyone can add functions to the code
without rewriting the basic part.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a1580.0x279a790"></a>User Authentication and Sessions</h2></div></div><p>The user login and sessions are managed through the session
API from J2EE. Usernames and passwords are authorized from a
database table, then the servlet engine establishes a session for
this user. The servlet engine tracks the sessions through session
objects.</p><p>The session object needs to know about the user who owns it.
That includes the user name, profile, preferences and current
browsing status. Storing such information in the session object
improves performance a lot. Otherwise, for example, the program has
to look up the database for display preferences every time prior to
displaying a page for a user.</p><p>Instead, I could store all the information inside the session
object itself. But for better organization, I used several
JavaBeans associated with session objects to store additional user
information. In JSP specifications, a JavaBean can have a scope of
a session or a page. Sessions with JavaBeans greatly simplify the
development work.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a1580.0x279a948"></a>Database Connections</h2></div></div><p>Database connections are expensive to establish. To open a
new connection every time we need to query can slow down the
computer drastically and use up the system resources
quickly.</p><p>There are several ways we can reduce the need for new
connections. One way is to assign one connection for each session.
That connection can be stored in a bean with session scope, and all
the queries from that session go through it. However, if many
sessions are active at the same time, available connections run out
fast. This solution does not scale well.</p><p>Another choice is to assign one connection per page. However,
I do not like this idea; the connection object has to be passed to
the middleware by the JSP coder. This is not intuitive to a
nontechnical JSP coder and defies the goal of separating
presentation from application logic. It is possible to design a set
of custom JSP tags to encapsulate the database connections so that
JSP coders do not see them, but it requires extra designing work
and that the JSP coder learn a nonstandard language. Using custom
tags certainly increases productivity in the long run, but it also
makes short and simple changes more difficult with a steeper
learning curve for the system. I am still seeking the best
solution. For now, I decided to hide the connection handling
completely inside the middleware.</p><p>I made a new database connection from every database query
function in the middleware. Each query function completes
multiple-related queries to make efficient use of connections. Each
JSP page calls only one or two such functions.</p><p>To reduce the overhead caused by opening new connections, I
used &ldquo;connection pool&rdquo; utilities. These utilities are classes
that maintain a pool of open connections in memory. When the user
requests a new connection, it simply fetches one from its pool
rather than making a new one. When the user closes the connection,
it returns to the pool. There are several such utilities, e.g.,
PoolMan. Their usage is very straightforward, and you only need
minimal changes to convert your code to take advantage of those
utilities.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a1580.0x279abb0"></a>Text Processing</h2></div></div><p>We have to allow users to mix some HTML tags in the text so
that they can format the memo and comments properly. However,
displaying user HTML has a big security risk: unauthorized user
HTML tags can corrupt/change the display of page navigation and
other people's comments. They can then be used to load unauthorized
images/applets or even redirect the user to another site using
JavaScript.</p><p>So, I decided to allow only four HTML tags: &lt;p&gt;,
&lt;b&gt;, &lt;i&gt; and &lt;a&gt;. That ensures the user cannot
change the format of any content other than her or his own. The
unauthorized HTML tags are filtered out before submitting text into
the database. The allowed HTML tags are configurable by the site
administrator at compile time.</p><p>It is also important to note that some users might want to
input XML sample code or mathematical formulas containing &ldquo;&lt;&rdquo;
in memos or comments. It would be inappropriate to treat all
&ldquo;&lt;&rdquo; as HTML tag tokens. So, I provide the plain text mode
under which all the &ldquo;&lt;&rdquo; symbols are converted to &ldquo;&amp;lt;&rdquo;
before being submitted into the database.</p><p>A powerful way to process text is using regular expressions.
There have been several good Java regular expression engines
available. I choose gnu.regexp because it is a free software
implementation of almost all Perl5 regular expression features
through a simple and intuitive API. The code for filtering HTML
tags and composing the SQL query string using a regular expression
engine is listed in Listing 2 [available at
