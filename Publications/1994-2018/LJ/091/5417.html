    Trademark selection is a job best done with the assistanceof your trademark attorney.

selecting good wine, requires skill and sophistication. Intuition
and common sense can often lead to ineffective trademarks, just as
guessing over the wine list can lead to a disappointing dining
experience.
</p><p>Some marketing managers who should know better suggest
legally ineffective trademarks for their products. Obviously I
cannot reveal too many specific details, so I will create some
examples to illustrate bad trademark choices I have seen. You
cannot simply take a noun that is generic for the goods or services
you're selling and make it into a trademark. This rule prevents
someone from claiming private ownership over a common word. Thus,
you can't use the word Computer as the trademark for a computer you
sell.</p><p>You cannot use tricks of written or spoken language to get
around these restrictions. Le Car would not be registrable to
describe the newest model of automobile. Making the trademark sound
like an exotic foreign language doesn't make the mark less generic.
You cannot create a trademark simply by describing obvious product
features and writing it in a unique way. Thus, PhoneRinger would
not be registrable for a device that makes a sound when a telephone
call arrives. And you cannot deliberately deceive consumers by
being misdescriptive. The mark OpenSource could not be applied to a
proprietary closed-source operating system. Trademarks that are
&ldquo;merely descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive&rdquo; cannot be
registered (15 U.S.C. &sect;1052(e)).</p><p>Another frequent mistake is to try to capitalize on a
competitor's trademarks (MacPizzas for a new chain of pizza parlors
or Pentalium for a microprocessor) to get instant recognition in
the marketplace. These trademarks probably would be attacked
because they are likely &ldquo;to cause confusion, or to cause mistake,
or to deceive&rdquo; as to the origin of the goods or services (15
U.S.C. &sect;1052(d)).</p><p>Trademarks can incorporate the adjectives Supreme, Superior
or Enhanced, but such marks are of limited value. These terms are
so over-used that they have lost their ability to distinguish goods
or services. Also, you cannot take someone else's trademark and add
one of those words to create your own trademark.</p><p>You must prevent your trademark or service mark from becoming
generic for your goods or services. That is why Xerox tries
diligently to prevent people from saying &ldquo;I'm going to make a
xerox of that document&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Xerox copy&rdquo;. To prevent your
trademark from becoming generic, always make sure it is used as an
adjective and never as a noun.</p><p>A trademark does not exist in isolation. It must be used in
conjunction with specific goods or services to signify the source
or origin of those goods or services. For this reason, the same
word can be used by more than one company as a trademark, as long
as the goods or services are different. Thus, you can buy a
Cadillac automobile and Cadillac dog food, and there will be no
confusion among customers seeking one product and accidentally
buying the other.</p><p>Trademark attorneys describe a spectrum of possible
trademarks. In ascending order, which roughly reflects their
eligibility for trademark status and the degree of protection
accorded, these classes are:</p><p>Descriptive: certain marks are descriptive of the product,
the name of the owner or the place where the product originates.
They convey an immediate idea of the ingredients, qualities or
characteristics of the goods. The distinction between a generic and
a descriptive term was illuminated using the example Deep Bowl
Spoon:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Deep Bowl&rdquo; identifies a significant
characteristic of the article. It is merely descriptive of the
goods, because it informs one that they are deep in the bowl
portion....It is not, however, the &ldquo;common descriptive name&rdquo; of
the article, [since] the implement is not a deep bowl, it is a
spoon....&ldquo;Spoon&rdquo; is not merely descriptive of the article&mdash;it
identifies the article&mdash;[and therefore] the term is generic.
</p><p>&mdash;Fletcher, &ldquo;Actual Confusion as to Incontestability of
Descriptive Marks&rdquo;, 64 Trademark Rep. 252, 260 (1974)</p></blockquote></div><p>Suggestive: a mark is suggestive if it requires imagination,
thought and perception to reach a conclusion as to the nature of
goods, for example, Orange Crush, Cuisinart and London Fog.
</p><p>Arbitrary: when a common word is used in an unfamiliar way,
examples include Apple, Apache and Python. Arbitrary terms often
make good trademarks because they are likely to be more appealing
to customers and are more easily remembered.</p><p>Fanciful: is usually applied to words invented solely for
their use as trademarks, such as Altoids or Kodak. Fanciful words
can make excellent trademarks because there is no possibility of
confusion with real words.</p><p>Legal advice must be provided in the course of an
attorney-client relationship specifically with reference to all the
facts of a particular situation and to the law in your
jurisdiction. Even though an attorney wrote this article, the
information in this article must not be relied upon as a substitute
for obtaining specific legal advice from a licensed
attorney.</p><p>Please send legal questions regarding open-source software
