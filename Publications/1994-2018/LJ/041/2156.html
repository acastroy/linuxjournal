    A very useful Linux feature is named pipes which enable different
    processes to communicate.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b7e580.0x1c76450"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of the fundamental features that
makes Linux and other Unices useful is the &ldquo;pipe&rdquo;. Pipes allow
separate processes to communicate without having been designed
explicitly to work together. This allows tools quite narrow in
their function to be combined in complex ways.
</p><p>A simple example of using a pipe is the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ls | grep x
</pre><p>When bash examines the command line, it finds the vertical
bar character <b  >|</b> that separates the two commands.
Bash and other shells run both commands, connecting the output of
the first to the input of the second. The <b  >ls</b>
program produces a list of files in the current directory, while
the <b  >grep</b> program reads the output of
<b  >ls</b> and prints only those lines containing the
letter <b  >x</b>.
</p><p>The above, familiar to most Unix users, is an example of an
&ldquo;unnamed pipe&rdquo;. The pipe exists only inside the kernel and cannot
be accessed by processes that created it, in this case, the bash
shell. For those who don't already know, a parent process is the
first process started by a program that in turn creates separate
child processes that execute the program.</p><p>The other sort of pipe is a &ldquo;named&rdquo; pipe, which is
sometimes called a FIFO. FIFO stands for &ldquo;First In, First Out&rdquo;
and refers to the property that the order of bytes going in is the
same coming out. The &ldquo;name&rdquo; of a named pipe is actually a file
name within the file system. Pipes are shown by
<b  >ls</b> as any other file with a couple of
differences:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% ls -l fifo1
prw-r--r--   1 andy  users    0 Jan 22 23:11 fifo1|
</pre><p>The <b  >p</b> in the leftmost column indicates
that fifo1 is a pipe. The rest of the permission bits control who
can read or write to the pipe just like a regular file. On systems
with a modern <b  >ls</b>, the <b  >|</b>
character at the end of the file name is another clue, and on Linux
systems with the color option enabled, <b  >fifo|</b> is
printed in red by default.
</p><p>On older Linux systems, named pipes are created by the
<b  >mknod</b> program, usually located in the /etc
directory. On more modern systems, <b  >mkfifo</b> is a
standard utility. The <b  >mkfifo</b> program takes one
or more file names as arguments for this task and creates pipes
with those names. For example, to create a named pipe with the name
<b  >pipe1</b> give the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkfifo pipe
</pre><p>The simplest way to show how named pipes work is with an
example. Suppose we've created <b  >pipe</b> as shown
above. In one virtual console1, type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ls -l &gt; pipe1
</pre>


and in another type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cat &lt; pipe
</pre>


Voila! The output of the command run on the first console shows up
on the second console. Note that the order in which you run the
commands doesn't matter.
</p><p>If you haven't used virtual consoles before, see the article
&ldquo;Keyboards, Consoles and VT Cruising&rdquo; by John M. Fisk in the
November 1996 <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>If you watch closely, you'll notice that the first command
you run appears to hang. This happens because the other end of the
pipe is not yet connected, and so the kernel suspends the first
process until the second process opens the pipe. In Unix jargon,
the process is said to be &ldquo;blocked&rdquo;, since it is waiting for
something to happen.</p><p>One very useful application of named pipes is to allow
totally unrelated programs to communicate with each other. For
example, a program that services requests of some sort (print
files, access a database) could open the pipe for reading. Then,
another process could make a request by opening the pipe and
writing a command. That is, the &ldquo;server&rdquo; can perform a task on
behalf of the &ldquo;client&rdquo;. Blocking can also happen if the client
isn't writing, or the server isn't reading.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b7e580.0x1c77000"></a>Pipe Madness</h2></div></div><p>Create two named pipes, pipe1 and pipe2. Run the
commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo -n x | cat - pipe1 &gt; pipe2 &amp;
cat &lt;pipe2 &gt; pipe1
</pre><p>On screen, it will not appear that anything is happening, but
if you run <b  >top</b> (a command similar to
<b  >ps</b> for showing process status), you'll see that
both <b  >cat</b> programs are running like crazy copying
the letter <b  >x</b> back and forth in an endless loop.
</p><p>After you press ctrl-C to get out of the loop, you may
receive the message &ldquo;<b  >broken pipe</b>&rdquo;. This error
occurs when a process writing to a pipe when the process reading
the pipe closes its end. Since the reader is gone, the data has no
place to go. Normally, the writer will finish writing its data and
close the pipe. At this point, the reader sees the
<b  >EOF</b> (end of file) and executes the
request.</p><p>Whether or not the &ldquo;broken pipe&rdquo; message is issued depends
on events at the exact instant the ctrl-C is pressed. If the second
<b  >cat</b> has just read the <b  >x</b>,
pressing ctrl-C stops the second <b  >cat</b>,
<b  >pipe1</b> is closed and the first
<b  >cat</b> stops quietly, i.e., without a message. On
the other hand, if the second <b  >cat</b> is waiting for
the first to write the <b  >x</b>, ctrl-C causes
<b  >pipe2</b> to close before the first
<b  >cat</b> can write to it, and the error message is
issued. This sort of random behavior is known as a &ldquo;race
condition&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b7e580.0x1c77790"></a>Command Substitution</h2></div></div><p>Bash uses named pipes in a really neat way. Recall that when
you enclose a command in parenthesis, the command is actually run
in a &ldquo;subshell&rdquo;; that is, the shell clones itself and the clone
interprets the command(s) within the parenthesis. Since the outer
shell is running only a single &ldquo;command&rdquo;, the output of a
complete set of commands can be redirected as a unit. For example,
the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(ls -l; ls -l) &gt;ls.out
</pre><p>writes two copies of the current directory listing to the
file ls.out.
</p><p>Command substitution occurs when you put a
<b  >&lt;</b> or <b  >&gt;</b> in front of the
left parenthesis. For instance, typing the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat &lt;(ls -l)
</pre><p>results in the command <b  >ls -l</b> executing in
a subshell as usual, but redirects the output to a temporary named
pipe, which bash creates, names and later deletes. Therefore,
<span   class="bold"><b>cat</b></span> has a valid file name to read
from, and we see the output of <b  >ls -l</b>, taking one
more step than usual to do so. Similarly, giving
<b  >&gt;(<i><tt>commands</tt></i>)</b>
results in Bash naming a temporary pipe, which the commands inside
the parenthesis read for input.
</p><p>If you want to see whether two directories contain the same
file names, run the single command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cmp &lt;(ls /dir1) &lt;(ls /dir2)
</pre><p>The compare program <b  >cmp</b> will see the names
of two files which it will read and compare.
</p><p>Command substitution also makes the <b  >tee</b>
command (used to view and save the output of a command) much more
useful in that you can cause a single stream of input to be read by
multiple readers without resorting to temporary files&mdash;bash does
all the work for you. The command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ls | tee &gt;(grep foo | wc &gt;foo.count) \
         &gt;(grep bar | wc &gt;bar.count) \
         | grep baz | wc &gt;baz.count
</pre><p>counts the number of occurrences of <b  >foo</b>,
<b  >bar</b> and <b  >baz</b> in the output of
<b  >ls</b> and writes this information to three separate
files. Command substitutions can even be nested:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cat &lt;(cat &lt;(cat &lt;(ls -l))))
</pre>


works as a very roundabout way to list the current directory.
</p><p>As you can see, while the unnamed pipes allow simple commands
to be strung together, named pipes, with a little help from bash,
allow whole trees of pipes to be created. The possibilities are
limited only by your imagination.</p></div></div>
