    This article describes how you can start an ISP and/or create an
    Intranet
    using Linux and a dedicated 28.8 connection.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1218580.0x13104a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>I became the founder of a small ISP for
the Baltimore, Maryland area by accident. My wife and I had been
having trouble finding a cheap and reliable Internet access
provider. After endless frustration with busy signals, we decided
to get a dedicated 28.8 line and use it as our connection to the
Internet. The connection would always be up and available, and we
could both use it to surf the Internet. It seemed natural to take
the next step and provide access to others. Beyond helping people
get on the Internet and giving me technical experience with Linux,
it could provide us with a source of revenue to recoup some of the
costs. Before you decide to become an ISP and make lots of money,
however, I should warn you competition is fierce and we are not yet
profitable.
</p><p>The Internet server setup we have is a simple one: a Linux
machine with four incoming lines for dialup and one outgoing line
to maintain the dedicated connection. We currently support about
twenty users on the machine. Although simple, this setup could
present a problem: if four users dialed in, each would receive
(28.8/4) = 7.2Kbps for his or her connection. Most of the time,
however, only one user is logged onto our machine, and he receives
full bandwidth. In addition, when multiple users are logged on, one
may be downloading or composing e-mail, another might be reading a
web page and a third may have walked to the bathroom.</p><p>One of the first steps you need to take to build a Linux
Internet server is to recompile the kernel with networking on, IP
forwarding/gatewaying on and any additional drivers selected. We
have a network card and a Cyclades Cyclom 16YeP card (a multiport
serial card) on the Linux machines, so we have those options turned
on. When you turn on the IP forwarding/gatewaying, it enables the
Linux machine to forward packets it receives over your network to
the Internet.</p><p>Another important step during setup is to get an account with
your ISP that supports point-to-point protocol (PPP). You can get a
dedicated 28.8 connection for about $100/month that will provide
you with full access to the Internet for your network. It is also
preferable that you sign up for a static IP address or a Class C
address and a domain name. A static IP address lets you log on to
the Internet with the same IP address all the time. We have a Class
C address, so this discussion uses only the Class C address. A
class C address gives you a block of addresses (255) you can use to
set up your internal network (Intranet). If you don't have a Class
C address but rather a static IP address, you'll have to use IP
Masquerading to access the Internet from your LAN. [See &ldquo;IP
Masquerading with Linux&rdquo; by Chris Kostick in the July 1996 issue
of <i  >Linux Journal</i>&mdash;Ed.]</p><p>We started building our Internet server by calling our ISP
and signing up for a Class C address with a domain name and a
dedicated 28.8 line. After we received our Class C address block
(206.156.217.*), I picked one of the addresses for our host
(206.156.217.10) and proceeded to set up our network using the
<b  >netconfig</b> utility bundled with Linux.</p><p>Your ISP should be able to maintain the Domain Name Server
(DNS) entry for your machine. The DNS entry allows Internet surfers
to access your IP address using your domain name. IP addresses like
ours (206.156.217.10) are hard to remember and non-descriptive; the
DNS entry allows surfers and customers to reach our machine using
NetBrain.com without knowing the IP address.</p><p>In the resolv.conf file, there should be a listing of the
domain name servers you'll be accessing. The file should look
something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#resolv.conf
Nameserver 206.156.208.2
nameserver 206.156.208.8
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1218580.0x13108c8"></a>Setting up PPP</h2></div></div><p>Using the <b  >ppp-on</b> script (part of the
<b  >pppd</b> package), you establish how your want your
PPP connection set up. The <b  >ppp-on</b> script is
shown in <a href="2025l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>. You use this
list to set up parameters such as the IP address of your machine
and the host machine, whether you're running pppd on a modem or
through a network, and the device you're using to make the
connection. The <b  >ppp-on</b> script calls the
<b  >ppp-on-dialer</b> script which actually dials the
modem to connect to your ISP. The <b  >ppp-on-dialer</b>
uses <b  >chat</b>, which dials the modem and also
handles getting past the ISP's startup screen (user name,
password). (Passing the 0.0.0.0 as a parameter for the remote is
another way of saying &ldquo;we don't care.&rdquo;) The important parameters
in the <b  >ppp-on</b> script include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>115200&mdash;serial port speed&mdash;this doesn't mean your
modem is as fast, but with some compression, it might get
close.</p></li><li><p>/dev/ttyC2&mdash;your modem'd port default
route&mdash;specifies this connection is the default route out of the
machine, if it can't find the address locally.</p></li></ul></div><p><a href="2025l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. ppp-on-dialer
Script</a></p><p>Note that the chat has the <b  >ogin my_login</b>
and <b  >assword: my_password</b> lines. This is chat's
way of saying, &ldquo;If you see <b  >ogin:</b> then type
<b  >my_login</b>; then when you see
<b  >assword</b> type <b  >my_password</b>.&rdquo;
You'll have to dial in manually to your ISP using a terminal
program to see how this login screen looks.</p><p>If you type <b  >ppp-on</b> and hear the modem dial
and connect, you've taken your first step to running an Internet
server. When PPP is running, you should be able to
<b  >ping</b> one of your ISP's machines from the Linux
shell. A good address to <b  >ping</b> is your ISP's DNS
machine.</p><p>If <b  >ping</b> is successful, try to see if
TELNET works. A simple check is to <b  >telnet</b> to one
of the MOO sites (<b  >telnet baymoo.org 8888</b>). If
that works, you are connected and being routed correctly. If you
have an account on another machine, you can also test the incoming
connection via TELNET. This is more a test to make sure your ISP
has the correct DNS entry. If you get the <b  >Unknown
host</b> error, either your ISP didn't put the entry in or it
hasn't made it out&mdash;sometimes it takes a few days to make it to all
the other machines.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1218580.0x13114d0"></a>Connecting Other Machines to Your Server</h2></div></div><p>Once your connection to the Internet is stable, it is time to
connect your network. Your Linux machine and your other machines
should all have network cards installed, and your Linux machine
should have the kernel compiled with the appropriate
drivers.</p><p>Suppose you want to set up Doofus (a Windows 95 client) and
hook into your network to give it access to the Internet. Pick an
IP address for Doofus of 206.156.217.7 (it can be any number
available within your Class C block). To set up the Windows 95
machine to access your Linux server, you must go into the
<b  >Control Panel</b> and pick
<b  >Network</b>. Make sure TCP/IP is bound to your
network card. The Properties button lets you set up the following
items on each of your machines:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>IP Address: If you have a Class C address, you can
assign an IP address 206.156.217.7 and a subnet mask of
255.255.255.0.</p></li><li><p>DNS Configuration: Pick <b  >Enable
DNS</b> and give your machine the name
<b  >Doofus</b> for the host and
<b  >NetBrain.com</b> for the domain. This setup provides
the Windows machine with the name
<b  >Doofus.NetBrain.com</b>&mdash;or read another way,
<b  >Doofus</b> is within
<b  >NetBrain.com</b>. The DNS Server Search Order should
have your DNS entries added to be the same as the Linux server's
/etc/resolv.conf nameserver entries.</p></li><li><p>WINS Configuration: Pick <b  >Disable WINS
Resolution</b></p></li><li><p>Bindings: Add a gateway to your Linux machine. The
gateway helps your machine find its way out of the network and onto
the Internet. We added 206.156.217.10 to the list of installed
gateways.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1218580.0x1311c60"></a>Test Your Windows 95 Client</h2></div></div><p>After you've rebooted your Win95 machine, you should be able
to <b  >ping</b> it from your Linux host using
<b  >ping 206.156.217.7</b>. If it fails, possible
problems could be the cable, Linux drivers, Win95 drivers or your
Win95 configuration. Now from the other side... When you're ready
to test your Windows 95 client, open an MS-DOS window and ping your
server. The command <b  >ping 206.156.217.10</b> should
get a response from your server. You should be able to TELNET to
your machine (<b  >telnet mickeymouse.com</b>) and should
also be able to bring up a browser and go to any web site that
interests you. It's that easy.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1218580.0x1308758"></a>Multiport Serial Card for Dial-up Access</h2></div></div><p>Most personal computers have only two serial ports, and one
of those is usually used by the mouse. The best way to provide
dial-up access is to purchase a multiport serial card. We use the
Cyclades Cyclom 16Yep card, which provides 16 serial ports for
modem use. More important, the drivers are built into the Linux
kernel.</p><p>Before you purchase a specific card, make sure the drivers
for the card exist and your machine has the drivers compiled into
the kernel. You might have to create the ports your serial card
uses with <b  >MAKEDEV</b>. Our Cyclades card uses
ttyC0-ttyC15 for the serial ports instead of the standard ttyS0 and
ttyS1 for the standard serial ports. Fortunately, the Cyclades card
came with a <b  >makecyc</b> install script that did the
work for me.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1218580.0x1308968"></a>Initializing Serial Ports</h2></div></div><p>The program <b  >setserial</b> needs to be called
to initialize the serial port(s). The /etc/rc.d/rc.serial file may
need to be edited to properly set up your server's serial ports. To
use com2 for the dial-out modem, put the following line in
rc.serial:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#standard serial port - com2:
setserial /dev/cua1 spd_vhi auto_irq autoconfig
</pre><p>For the Cyclades card, I configured the ports 3-10 /dev/cub2
- /dev/cub10 (some unused&mdash;for expansion) as follows:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#configure Cyclades serial ports
setserial -b /dev/cub2 spd_vhi autoirq skip_test
setserial -b /dev/cub3 spd_vhi autoirq skip_test
setserial -b /dev/cub4 spd_vhi autoirq skip_test
setserial -b /dev/cub5 spd_vhi autoirq skip_test
setserial -b /dev/cub6 spd_vhi autoirq skip_test
setserial -b /dev/cub7 spd_vhi autoirq skip_test
setserial -b /dev/cub8 spd_vhi autoirq skip_test
setserial -b /dev/cub9 spd_vhi autoirq skip_test
</pre>


Make sure the rc.serial file is called from one of the startup rc
files, usually rc.s. This will configure your serial ports
automatically during boot.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1218580.0x1308bd0"></a>Modifying the gettys File</h2></div></div><p>Next, you need to configure the host to listen to the serial
port for incoming connections and to to answer these connections.
The /etc/gettydefs file is used to set up the
<b  >gettys</b> which make connections to the machine.
When a standard version of Linux is installed, you find these lines
in the /etc/gettydefs file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
c1:1235:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty1 linux
c2:1235:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty2 linux
c3:1235:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty3 linux
c4:1235:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty4 linux
c5:1235:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty5 linux
c6:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty6 linux
</pre><p>This provides your console (keyboard) with six virtual
logins. The fourth item in the line <b  >/sbin/agetty</b>
is the program polling the console for a login. The following
parameters describe the login speed, terminal number and terminal
emulation. You add the following lines for dial-up lines after the
parameters list.
<pre     class="programlisting">
# Dial-up lines using /sbin/getty
# (actually getty_ps)
s1:345:respawn:/sbin/getty ttyC2 115200 vt100
s2:345:respawn:/sbin/getty ttyC3 115200 vt100
s3:345:respawn:/sbin/getty ttyC4 115200 vt100
</pre>


We use a different getty (getty_ps) for our dial-up lines because
of trouble using agetty on the serial port. We also also heard that
getty_ps is more reliable. You can also use mgetty for the dial-up
lines, but getty_ps works great for us. The parameters for getty_ps
are slightly different, however: parameters following the getty
name are the tty, the /etc/gettydef label and the terminal
emulation default. The <b  >115200</b> in the preceding
lines refers to the label in /etc/gettydefs file shown here:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#/etc/gettydefs
# Modem locked at 115200: Serial port is at
# 115200, modem is much less, but should be
# able to compress.
#
# Last line of this file is described in next
# comment line as fields separated by # signs.
# label # initial-flags # final-flags # login prompt # next label
115200# B115200 CS8 CRTSCTS # B115200 SANE -ISTRIP CRTSCTS #@S login: #115200
</pre>


Now you have to provide the getty_ps with the startup values. In
the directory /etc/defaults, place the configuration files for each
dial-up line. For the dial-up line /dev/ttyC2, we have a
corresponding file called /etc/default/getty.ttyC2 shown in
<a href="2025l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>.
</p><p>If everything works as planned, the host should be able
accept shell logins. You should be able to dial into your machine
and run commands in the shell.</p><p>To monitor the dial-up connection, you can set the
<b  >DEBUG=777</b> in the /etc/default/getty.tty?? file
to create a log file. This will help you identify problems should
the modem not answer or not configure properly. The output is
dumped to the syslog file usually in /var/adm/syslog.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1218580.0x13090a0"></a>Dial-up Shell Access for Users</h2></div></div><p>This confirmation, which provides people with shell dial-up
access, can be modified to provide dial-up PPP access to customers.
We chose to modify the default <b  >login</b> program (in
the <b  >poeigl</b> package) because we wanted to provide
both PPP and shell access (useful when I'm remotely setting up
someone's machine). The <b  >ppplogin</b> program has a
prompt that looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Username: jsmith
Password:
Please select PPP or Shell access:
1) PPP
2) Shell
Please enter your choice: 1
</pre><p>If the user picks the <b  >shell</b>, Linux invokes
the standard defined shell for the user. If PPP is selected, a
script invokes <b  >pppd</b> for the dial-up user and
dynamically allocates him an IP address. Part of the C code for
invoking the ppp script file looks like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/* --- PPP account login --- */
execlp ("/bin/sh", "-sh", "-c",
   "/etc/ppp/ppplogin", (char *)0);
fprintf (stderr,
   "login: couldn't exec shell script: %s.\n",
strerror (errno));
exit(0);
</pre>


The /etc/ppp/ppplogin is shown in <a href="2025l4.html" target="_self">Listing
4</a>.
</p><p>When a user selects ppp, the server looks up the tty the
person dialing in is using and assigns the tty an IP address. If
the user always calls in on a specific line, he is given the same
IP address. A user dialing in on the first line comes in on ttyC6.
This is used to assign an IP address of 206.156.217.31 to the user.
This creates a PPP link to the dial-up line like the PPP link to my
host. The important parameters related to this tty/ppp connection
in the ppplogin script are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Detach&mdash;don't run as a background process.</p></li><li><p>Modem&mdash;use the carrier lines to detect things like
<b  >hanging up</b></p></li><li><p>206.156.217.10:206.156.217.35&mdash;I am known as
206.156.217.10, and the person on the other end is known as
206.156.217.35.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1218580.0x13097d8"></a>Keeping the Connection Established</h2></div></div><p>Early on we found our dedicated connection was frequently
dropped by the phone company. I solved this problem by using a
program called <b  >pppupd</b> which constantly pings our
ISP's machine and, if the <b  >ping</b> fails, it invokes
the <b  >ppp-on</b> script to redial the
connection.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1218580.0x13099e8"></a>Fax Services and Seamless Windows 95
Dial-up</h2></div></div><p>Most of our customers are Windows 95 users who did not like
having to type their name and password in each time they logged on
to the server. To remove this source of irritation, we found a
different getty package called <b  >mgetty</b>, which
provides autodetection of PPP dialers for Windows 95 users who want
to use the Dial-up Networking dialog box. This has saved us quite a
bit of time supporting Windows 95 users. The
<b  >mgetty</b> package
(http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Serial/mgetty+sendfax) is
difficult to set up, so read the documentation before building. One
wonderful feature of this package is the capability to receive
faxes on the incoming modem lines without additional hardware or
additional lines. We can use the same dial-up lines to receive
faxes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1218580.0x1309ba0"></a>E-mail</h2></div></div><p>E-mail for us was automatically configured with my Linux
installation. You can install <b  >pine</b> for shell
access and POP v3 for POP server e-mail. If you don't have the POP
server installed, you can get a package called
<b  >pop3d</b> from any of the various sites, such as
sunsite.unc.edu, and follow the instructions to install it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1218580.0x1309d58"></a>Web Server</h2></div></div><p>If you want your machine to host web pages, you have to
install a web server. We downloaded the Apache web server
(http://www.apache.org/) and recompiled and configured it using the
available documentation. Compiling the source should create an
<b  >httpd</b> executable which can be copied into
/usr/sbin. In addition, add the line
<b  >/usr/sbin/httpd</b> in the /etc/rc.d/rc.local
configuration file for it to be automatically started during boot
up.</p></div></div>
