    An introduction to building a database using SQL in Perl and

    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x176e580.0x18663f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>In my work, I often find myself writing
CGI programs that need to read or write information on the file
system attached to a web server. Sometimes, this information is
fairly simple, throwaway stuff, such as logging information accrued
when I am trying to debug a particularly difficult program.
</p><p>Sometimes, as we saw in a series of columns earlier this
year, we can use text files for the storage and retrieval of
structured information, such as the questions and answers for a
multiple-choice quiz. Those quizzes were stored in a simple format,
with each question placed on a line by itself. For example, here is
a line that might have come from one of those quizzes:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
What color was George Washington's white horse? White   Black   Gray    Pink    a
</pre><p>While the mechanics of magazine publishing mean that you
cannot see the difference between various whitespace characters,
the above line is separated into six fields: The question text, the
four answers presented to the user, and a letter (<b  >a, b,
c</b> or <b  >d</b>) indicating which of the four
answers is correct. Fields are separated by Tab characters (ASCII
9), which look identical to space characters (ASCII 32), but which
are quite different as far as the computer is concerned.
</p><p>The quiz programs we explored earlier this year expected to
read from files containing one or more such lines, with each line
representing a single question. A quiz containing a single question
(for users who prefer easy challenges) would have one line, while a
quiz containing 1000 questions would contain 1000 lines.</p><p>This raises the important issue of scalability, the
software's ability to remain efficient even when data sets become
quite large. It is not difficult to write programs that can handle
small amounts of data efficiently, particularly as hardware
continues to drop in price while increasing in performance. It is
much harder, though, to write software that can handle large
amounts of data.</p><p>ASCII text files are wonderful when dealing with small
amounts of data, since they are easy to manipulate from within
programs, particularly when using Perl, which is strong in handling
regular expressions. But when we must work with a large amount of
data, or when we want to perform sophisticated searches, we may
find ourselves reinventing the wheel or working with tools (such as
ASCII text files) that no longer fit our needs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x176e580.0x18667c0"></a>Basic SQL</h2></div></div><p>A common solution to this problem is to off-load the data
storage and retrieval to a program known as a relational database
server. The &ldquo;server&rdquo; part of the name indicates that it expects
to receive requests from one or more clients, and the &ldquo;database&rdquo;
part of the name indicates its storage and retrieval of information
on behalf of those clients. You may, however, be unfamiliar with
the &ldquo;relational&rdquo; part of the name, which means that data is
stored in sets of tables, which we can access using SQL, the
Structured Query Language. This month, we take a first look at SQL
queries, including how they can be integrated into our CGI
programs; in the coming months, we will explore this topic in
greater depth, using relational database servers for a variety of
projects.</p><p>SQL is an international standard to which many corporate
databases adhere. While the &ldquo;L&rdquo; in SQL stands for &ldquo;language&rdquo;,
it does not mean that you can write programs in SQL. Rather, SQL is
a language for formulating queries to database servers. The SQL
commands must be incorporated into programs written in a true
programming language, such as Perl or C.</p><p>Relational databases work on the client-server model, just as
the Web does. Whereas web clients and servers communicate using
HTTP, database clients and servers communicate with SQL. Needless
to say, SQL is much more complicated than HTTP, although as you
will see, it is fairly straightforward to learn. SQL may be easy to
learn, but that does not mean it is simple. On the contrary,
long-time database administrators and programmers understand more
about the storage and retrieval of data using SQL than I could ever
imagine.</p><p>The key to understanding SQL is to realize that everything in
an SQL database is stored in a table. Rows in the table represent
table records, while columns represent fields. Thus, we could
represent an address book as a table.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Name    Telephone
----    ---------
Reuven  04-824-2265
Andy    02-123-4567
Gil     04-999-8888
</pre><p>There are three records in this table, each represented by a
row. Each record contains two fields, each represented by a column.
Each table and column must have a name, so we will call this the
&ldquo;phone_book&rdquo; table, with two columns, &ldquo;name&rdquo; and &ldquo;telephone&rdquo;.
</p><p>So far, this might not seem like a great advance over what we
have done with text files. Why bother with rows, columns, and
tables when we can use an ASCII file?</p><p>The simple answer is that we can allow the database server to
do the work for us&mdash;and it will return an answer to us very
quickly, as per our instructions, without getting bogged down by
the number of records in the database. If we were interested in
finding Andy's telephone number with a text file version of the
above table, we would need to iterate through the entire file,
checking each record for a match. With a relational database, we
can issue an SQL query to the database server, asking for only
those rows which match our particular criteria.</p><p>Thus, if we were interested in retrieving Andy's telephone
number from the table above, we could use an SQL
<b  >select</b> command to do so:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
select telephone from phone_book where name =
        "Andy";
</pre><p>The SQL statement above asks the database server to return
the <b  >telephone</b> column from the table named
<b  >phone_book</b>, for each row in which the name is
Andy. If a single row matches the query, we receive a single row as
a response from the database server, but if multiple rows match, we
receive all of those rows. If no row matches our query, we receive
no rows, which might seem odd, until you realize that database
client programs often iterate over the results returned to them.
Iterating over no values is as easy as iterating over 100 values,
although most good client programs check to make sure that at least
one row was returned.
</p><p>We can insert a row into our table with the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
insert into phone_book (name,telephone) values
        ("Iris","04-999-8888");
</pre><p>After performing the operation above, our table looks like:
</p><p>Name Telephone---- ---------Reuven 04-824-2265Andy
02-123-4567Gil 04-999-8888Iris 04-999-8888</p><p>which we can see by retrieving everything, using an asterisk
to mean &ldquo;all columns&rdquo;:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
select * from phone_book;
</pre><p>If we want to retrieve all of the rows belonging to people
with the telephone number 04-999-8888, we use this line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
select name from phone_book where telephone =
        "04-999-8888";
</pre>


Note that we do not need to worry about two identical records,
since relational databases strictly require each record to be
unique in some way. Two rows might differ in only a single column,
but that column is enough to make the rows distinct.
</p><p>One advantage, then, of using SQL and a relational database
server is the increased efficiency, both of our programs (which no
longer need to read the entire contents of a text file) and
ourselves (since we no longer need to write matching engines and
define data formats). There are other advantages to using SQL and
relational databases too; most importantly, database servers handle
file locking in a sophisticated and efficient way, ensuring that
data is not lost while keeping operations moving along
quickly.</p><p>Relational databases also offer an amazing array of
optimization techniques and security levels, among other things.
And best of all, SQL is a portable standard that (mostly) works in
the same way on a great many database systems; that is, once you
learn how to write some basic SQL queries, you will be able to
store your data on just about any available platform.</p><p>Most of my SQL experience is with Sybase on Solaris systems,
but for the purposes of this article, I decided the time had come
to install a relational database server on my Linux machine
(running Red Hat 4.0 with a number of updated packages, including
the 2.0.30 kernel). I decided to download MySQL, a database server
that looked small but powerful, and which came in RPM (Red Hat
Package Manager) format, allowing me to install it quickly. (Don't
confuse MySQL with mSQL, another relational database package
available for Linux. For information on how to obtain MySQL, see
the sidebar accompanying this article.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x176e580.0x1867108"></a>Using SQL from Perl</h2></div></div><p>MySQL comes with a client program named, oddly enough,
<b  >mysql</b>, which allows us to enter SQL queries
directly to the database server, which is presumably running at all
times. We enter the database with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[1016] ~% mysql test
Welcome to the mysql monitor. Commands end with ; or \g.
Type 'help' for help.
mysql&gt;
</pre><p>Just as file systems store files within subdirectories within
directories, relational databases store tables inside of databases
inside of the overall structure. Thus, when we enter MySQL, we need
to specify the name of the database we would like to use. In
example above, we specified the <b  >test</b> database,
to which all users have access without needing to go through the
standard procedure of entering a user name and password. While user
names and passwords for relational databases can be the same as
those for the user's account on the system, they do not need to be.
Indeed, for the sake of system security, you should make them
distinct from your regular system passwords.
</p><p>Generally speaking, it is also a good idea to create one or
more databases exclusively for CGI programs, in order to avoid
giving programs complete access to all databases on the system. The
nature of CGI programming is such that users might be able to read
the user name and password from the program's source code, thus
giving them access to whatever tables are in a given database.
However, in the interest of time and space, I encourage you to read
the MySQL documentation, which describes how to set user
permissions for various databases on the system In the meantime, we
will use the <b  >test</b> database, to which all users
have access, for our examples</p><p>To create our telephone directory table, we type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mysql&gt; create table phone_book (name char(255),
        telephone char(255));
</pre><p>Whitespace is unimportant in SQL queries. In the above
example, I pressed enter between the end of the first line and the
<b  >go</b> statement on the second line. As you might
expect, the <b  >go</b> command tells a database client
to send the query to the database server, where it is evaluated and
executed. Alternatively, we can use a semicolon at the end of our
query, which will preclude the need for <b  >go</b>.
</p><p>The server responds to our query by giving us some
statistics:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.27 sec)
</pre><p>In other words, creating a table took .27 seconds and did not
affect any existing rows.
</p><p>You can quit <b  >mysql</b> by typing
<b  >quit</b> at the <b  >mysql&gt;</b>
prompt.</p><p>The MySQL programmatic interface from Perl works in much the
same way as the command-line program, except that it uses Perl 5
objects. The basic idea is straightforward; we create an instance
of a MySQL object, and then use that object to get through the
process of logging in, sending queries, and interpreting the
results.</p><p><a href="2421l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> contains a
functional program that can query our <b  >phone_book</b>
table and return the results. More importantly, though, that
program is the skeleton for every program we write using MySQL.
While the syntax might be slightly different for Sybase and other
databases, the general idea is the same&mdash;connect to the database
server, choose a database, send a query in SQL and iterate through
whatever results are returned.</p><p>First, we connect to the database server using Unix sockets,
in part because MySQL enables those sockets by default, which makes
for an easier explanation in a short column such as this one. You
can, of course, also connect to a database server running elsewhere
on the network, just as a web browser can connect to a web server
across a network.</p><p>Once we are connected to the MySQL server, we use the query
method to enter our SQL query. Just as connecting to the database
returns the database handle <b  >$dbh</b>, sending an SQL
query returns the statement handle <b  >$sth</b>. And
just as we need to use <b  >$dbh</b> in order to send a
statement, we need to use <b  >$sth</b> in order to
retrieve results. In this particular statement, we have asked to
see both of the table's columns, as well as all of the rows in the
table. However, we could restrict our query with a
<b  >where</b> clause, as described earlier, which would
return a subset of the table's rows. We could also ask for a subset
of the table's columns, such that only the name or the telephone
number would be returned.</p><p>Results are retrieved by iterating over the rows that were
returned from the server. If no rows match our query, the iteration
is not performed; if 100 rows match our query, it is performed 100
times. If we are interested in maximizing the efficiency of our
programs that handle SQL queries, it is in our interest to
construct queries that return only those rows that most interest
us, since iterating through a large number of rows can be quite
inefficient and time-consuming.</p><p>If I run the program in Listing 1 (named sql-test.pl on my
system) from the command line, I get:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[1031] ~/Text/<i  >LJ</i>% ./sql-test.pl
Iris    04-999-8888
Reuven  04-824-2265
Andy    02-123-4567
Gil     04-999-8888
</pre><p>We can, of course, use the above skeleton program to insert
rows, create tables and do more complicated things, such as joining
tables together (which is, to a large degree, the magic behind SQL)
and order results in ascending or descending order. If we were to
keep the area code in a different column from the telephone number
itself, we could refine our searches even further, asking for all
people within a given area code whose first name is
<b  >Iris</b>, for example.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x176e580.0x185e700"></a>Using MySQL from a CGI program</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have seen some basic uses of MySQL from within
Perl, let's spend some time thinking about how we can integrate the
use of MySQL into a CGI program. While this might seem like
overkill for some small jobs, database servers are so much more
reliable and efficient at this sort of task than our CGI programs
that it is almost always worth using such a server, assuming one is
available.</p><p>By using a database server, we can be sure that our data is
stored more reliably than with text files. As an added bonus, the
information is available using SQL, which is more efficient and
flexible than text files.</p><p>How can we use a database server from within our CGI
programs? The simple answer is that it is actually no different
from connecting to a database server from within non-CGI programs.
We still create the Mysql object, use its methods to send an SQL
query and retrieve results. The differences are in our ability to
modify our query based on input sent to us in an HTML form and the
necessity of sending our output to the user's browser using a
recognized content type (usually HTML). Such a program, which I
have called cgi-sql-test.pl is shown in
<a href="2421l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>.</p><p>While cgi-sql-test.pl is longer than the program on which it
is based, it is not much more complicated.</p><p>First, we fire up the CGI module for Perl, which you can get
via the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) at
http://www.perl.com/CPAN. After creating an instance of CGI, we
send an HTTP <b  >Content-type</b> header to the user's
browser indicating that we will be returning results of type
<b  >text/html</b>, i.e., HTML-formatted text.</p><p>Following our initialization of the CGI environment, we go
ahead with what we had done in the non-CGI version of the program,
namely connecting to the database, sending our query and retrieving
the results.</p><p>This is where the big difference lies. Rather than printing
the results to standard output, we send them in HTML format to the
user's browser, so that we can use all sorts of nifty HTML
formatting techniques to display the results.</p><p>In this particular example, I decided to put the results of
the telephone list in an HTML table, which is attractive and makes
it easy to understand the results. The
<b  >&lt;tr&gt;</b> tag introduces a table row, while the
<b  >&lt;td&gt;</b> tag introduces a column within a row.
Because each iteration through the <b  >while</b> loop
represents a new record in the database, we can start a new HTML
row at the top of each loop, ending it at the bottom of each
loop.</p><p>We will continue to explore the interaction between SQL and
CGI in the next few installments, but before I conclude this
month's column, I want to show at least one example of how we can
modify the SQL queries based on the user's input. For the sake of
simplicity, we modify our program such that it will ask the
database server to return only those rows whose
<b  >name</b> column matches what we enter in the query
string. Thus, if we are interested in finding out Gil's telephone
number, we can go to:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/cgi-bin/cgi-sql-test.pl?Gil
</pre><p>And if we are interested in finding out Andy's telephone
number, we can go to:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/cgi-bin/cgi-sql-test.pl?Andy
</pre>


which produces only that listing.
</p><p>But what happens if someone invokes our program without
entering a name in the query string? Well, our program cleverly
notices it and produces a very small page of HTML in response. This
small page of HTML asks the user to enter a name for which to
search and then uses the <b  >&lt;isindex&gt;</b> tag to
create a text field in the page of HTML.</p><p>The <b  >&lt;isindex&gt;</b> tag has generally
fallen out of favor, since HTML forms are more flexible and useful.
When a user enters information into an
<b  >&lt;isindex&gt;</b> field and presses enter, the URL
in which the <b  >&lt;isindex&gt;</b> tag appeared is
reloaded&mdash;with the user's input appended as part of the query
string.</p><p>Thus, if our program receives no input in the query string,
it produces a page containing <b  >&lt;isindex&gt;</b>.
Whatever the user enters in that text field causes our program to
be reloaded, this time with a value in the query string. That value
is picked up by our program and passed to MySQL, which returns the
results in an HTML table.</p><p>That concludes the basic introduction regarding the
integration of SQL and CGI programs. As you might imagine, SQL
databases are far more powerful than the programs and databases we
have seen this month. Over the next few months, we will spend some
more time looking at different ways in which we can use MySQL (and
relational database servers in general) to make for more
interesting, efficient and useful web sites.</p></div></div>
