a void that its acceptance is all but guaranteed. For Linux
programmers or anyone interested in learning Unix programming,
there is a new volume to add to your library: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Beginning
Linux Programming</em></span> by Neil Matthew and Richard Stones.
The book is an achievement both in terms of its subject coverage as
well as its surprising depth for a text whose focus, as the title
states, is the neophyte. The authors' aim is &ldquo;to cover enough
about a wide range of topics to give you a good beginning in each
subject.&rdquo; In this they succeed magnificently. Inside are full
chapters on shell programming (<b  >/bin/sh</b>), an
introduction to the Unix file system, terminal I/O, the curses
library and a chapter on processes and signals. There is a chapter
on how to use the GNU gcc compiler, the gdb debugger, make, RCS and
other development tools. (They even teach you the basics of how to
write a man page for all those new applications you'll write after
mastering Linux programming.) The authors cover Linux's
X/Open-compliant dbm database (some distributions have gdbm, the
GNU flavor of dbm). They devote one hundred and fourteen pages to
interprocess communication alone, including pipes, FIFOs, System V
IPC (Semaphores, Message Queues, Shared Memory) and Berkeley
sockets. There is a 93-page introduction to X programming which
focuses primarily on Tcl, Tk and Wish, along with a sip of Java.
The book concludes with two chapters devoted to Internet
programming, one covering HTML and the other CGI.</p><p>With such a vast scope, something had to be left out.
Coverage of Expect is assigned to two short paragraphs. Python is
missing, as is the majority of Motif programming outside of Tcl/Tk
(Xlib and Xt are only mentioned in passing). The only coverage of
Perl is an example CGI script, and the section on Java could pass
by you entirely, if your nose is not careful to pick up the scent
of the fresh brew at the close of the discussion of X programming.
(Interesting that Java is appended to X programming, not the
Internet programming chapters.) Nevertheless, such focus is
necessary to avoid a text of several volumes and to concentrate on
the omissions would be to miss the point of the work, which is to
introduce you to Linux programming through the use of hands-on code
examples, which are graduated and presented in a step-by-step
fashion. Each new topic is presented in a few short paragraphs and
is followed by a succinct but complete &ldquo;Try It Out&rdquo; code
example.</p><p>Over 10,000 lines of source code fill the pages, all of which
are available for download (the ubiquitous CD is missing from the
back cover). With such a supply of source code, the usual
peccadilloes occur, such as a case statement in the section on
shell programming, that lists the case as
&ldquo;<b  >[nN]*</b>&rdquo; (with quotes) instead of
<b  >[nN]*</b> without the quotation marks (the former
fails if you enter anything beginning with a <b  >n</b>
or a <b  >N</b>); or when, during the discussion of
pipes, the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sprintf(buffer, "Once apon a time, there ..."\n)
</pre><p>is magically spell-checked to &ldquo;Once
<span   class="emphasis"><em>upon</em></span> a time&rdquo; in the book's output listing
(unfortunately, my compiler isn't as smart as the editors and keeps
the spelling as &ldquo;apon&rdquo;). All in all, the source code compiles and
runs fine. Wrox Press, the publisher, has the source and a sample
chapter on its web site for your perusal, at http://www.wrox.com/.
</p><p>The example code gets to the point. The authors present the
minimum amount of code to illustrate an idea which, once given, is
quickly summarized as they move on to the next extrapolation or
improvement. This approach allows the new Linux programmer to get a
firm grasp on the subject without too much diversion or
interdependence. All examples are self-contained and may be
compiled and run&mdash;there are no code fragments here. Such an
approach facilitates and encourages the reader to experiment with
the code examples, since they are so confined few side effects can
be introduced, even by the most intrepid of newbies.</p><p>Although most of the examples are focused, the authors do
present and develop a larger application that implements a simple
audio CD cataloging program. The application begins life early in
Chapter 2 as an extremely simple shell script that exercises the
use of flow-control statements in shell programming and uses simple
text files for a database. The application reappears in Chapter 6.
This time rewritten in C with the same functionality as the shell
script version and with a new interface designed to exercise the
curses terminal library. In Chapter 7, the application acquires a
real database, dbm. In Chapter 11, the application evolves into a
small client-server system, which separates the database from the
user interface through the use of named pipes. This example
illustrates process synchronization and bi-directional data flow
between a single server and multiple clients. In Chapter 12, the
application substitutes a message queue for the named pipes from
the previous chapter, which solves some problems with I/O
synchronization previously encountered with named pipes. Finally,
the CD application takes to the Web in Chapter 17 as an example of
an HTML interface talking out a CGI layer to the database server.
This chameleon-like application greatly enhances the communication
of many of the principles presented in the book.</p><p>In short, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Beginning Linux Programming</em></span> is
a tutorial on the major topics in Linux programming. If you are
willing to spend some time getting up to speed, you will find
yourself with a book that not only will hold your hand in the midst
of the Magic Garden, but will eventually provide you with a fine
pair of walking shoes, well preparing you for your own
explorations. With this book at your side, as my son's beginning
reader puts it:</p><p>You have brains in your head.You have feet in your shoes.You
can steer yourselfany direction you choose.</p></div></div>
