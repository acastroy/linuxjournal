    A look at the sysctl system call that gives you the ability to
    fine
    tune kernel parameters.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bd7580.0x1ccf3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The
<span   class="bold"><b>sysctl</b></span> system call is an
interesting feature of the Linux kernel; it is quite unique in the
Unix world. The system call exports the ability to fine-tune kernel
parameters and is tightly bound to the /proc file system, a
simpler, file-based interface that can be used to perform the same
tasks available by means of the system call.
<span   class="bold"><b>sysctl</b></span> appeared in kernel 1.3.57
and has been fully supported ever since. This article explains how
to use sysctl with any kernel between 2.0.0 and 2.1.35.
</p><p>When running Unix kernels, system administrators often need
to fine-tune some low-level features according to their specific
needs. Usually, system tailoring requires you rebuilding the kernel
image and rebooting the computer. These tasks are lengthy ones
which require good skills and a little luck to be successfully
completed. Linux developers diverged from this approach and chose
to implement variable parameters in place of hardwired constants;
run-time configuration can be performed by using the
<span   class="bold"><b>sysctl</b></span> system call or more easily
by exploiting the /proc file system. The internals of
<span   class="bold"><b>sysctl</b></span> are designed not only to
read and modify configuration parameters, but also to support a
dynamic set of such variables. In other words, the module writer
can insert new entries in the sysctl tree and allow run-time
configuration of driver features.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bd7580.0x1ccf6b8"></a>The /proc Interface to System Control</h2></div></div><p>Most Linux users are familiar with the /proc file system. In
short, the file system can be considered a gateway to kernel
internals: its files are entry points to certain kernel
information. Such information is usually exchanged in textual form
to ease interactive use, although the exchange can involve binary
data when required. The typical example of a binary /proc file is
/proc/kcore, a core file that represents the current kernel. Thus,
you can execute the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gdb /usr/src/linux/vmlinux /proc/kcore
</pre><p>and peek into your running kernel. Naturally,
<b  >gdb</b> on /proc/kcore gives much better results if
vmlinux has been compiled using the <b  >-g</b> compiler
option.
</p><p>Most of the /proc files are read-only: writing to them has no
effect. This applies, for instance, to /proc/interrupts,
/proc/ioports, /proc/net/route and all the other information nodes.
The directory /proc/sys, on the other hand, behaves differently; it
is the root of a file tree related to system control. Each
subdirectory in /proc/sys deals with a kernel subsystem like net/
and vm/, while the kernel/ subdirectory is special as it includes
kernel-wide parameters, like the file kernel/hostname.</p><p>Each sysctl file includes numeric or string values&mdash;sometimes
a single value, sometimes an array of them. For example, if you go
to the /proc/sys directory and give the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
grep . kernel/*
</pre><p>kernel 2.1.32 returns data similar to the following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
kernel/ctrl-alt-del:0
kernel/domainname:systemy.it
kernel/file-max:1024
kernel/file-nr:128
kernel/hostname:morgana
kernel/inode-max:3072
kernel/inode-nr:384     263
kernel/osrelease:2.1.32
kernel/ostype:Linux
kernel/panic:0nn
kernel/printk:6   4    1   7
kernel/securelevel:0
kernel/version:#9 Mon Apr 7 23:08:18 MET DST 1997
</pre>


It's worth stressing that reading /proc items with
<span   class="bold"><b>less</b></span> doesn't work, because they
appear as zero-length files to the
<span   class="bold"><b>stat</b></span> system call, and
<span   class="bold"><b>less</b></span> checks the attributes of the
file before reading it. The inaccuracy of
<span   class="bold"><b>stat</b></span> is a feature of /proc, rather
than a bug. It's a saving in human resources (in writing code), and
kernel size (in carrying the code around).
<span   class="bold"><b>stat</b></span> information is completely
irrelevant for most files, as <span   class="bold"><b>cat</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span> and all the other tools work
fine. If you really need to use
<span   class="bold"><b>less</b></span> to look at the contents of a
/proc file, you can resort to:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cat
</pre>


If you want to change system parameters, all you need to do is
write the new values to the correct file in /proc/sys. If the file
contains an array of values, they will be overwritten in order.
Let's look at the kernel/printk file as an example.
<b  >printk</b> was first introduced in kernel version
2.1.32. The four numbers in /proc/sys/kernel/printk control the
&ldquo;verbosity&rdquo; level of the <b  >printk</b> kernel
function. The first number in the array is
<b  >console_loglevel</b>: kernel messages with priority
less than or equal to the specified value will be printed to the
system console (i.e., the active virtual console, unless you've
changed it). This parameter doesn't affect the operation of
<b  >klogd</b>, which receives all the messages in any
case. The following commands show how to change the log level:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# cat kernel/printk
6       4       1       7
# echo 8 &gt; kernel/printk
# cat kernel/printk
8       4       1       7
</pre>


A level of 8 corresponds to debug messages, which are not printed
on the console by default. The example session shown above changes
the default behaviour so that every message, including the debug
ones, are printed.
</p><p>Similarly, you can change the host name by writing the new
value to /proc/kernel/hostname&mdash;a useful feature if the
<span   class="bold"><b>hostname</b></span> command is not
available.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bd7580.0x1cd0058"></a>Using the System Call</h2></div></div><p>Even though the /proc file system is a great resource, it is
not always available in the kernel. Since it's not vital to system
operation, there are times when you choose to leave it out of the
kernel image or simply don't mount it. For example, when building
an embedded system, saving 40 to 50KB can be advantageous. Also, if
you are concerned about security, you may decide to hide system
information by leaving /proc unmounted.</p><p>The system call interface to kernel tuning, namely sysctl, is
an alternative way to peek into configurable parameters and modify
them. One advantage of sysctl is that it's faster, as no fork/exec
is involved (i.e., no external programs are spawned) nor is any
directory lookup. However, unless you run an ancient platform, the
performance savings are irrelevant.</p><p>To use the system call in a C program, the header file
sys/sysctl.h must be included; it declares the sysctl function
as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int sysctl (int *name, int nlen, void *oldval,
  size_t *oldlenp, void *newval, size_t newlen);
</pre><p>If your standard library is not up to date, the
<b  >sysctl</b> function will neither be prototyped in
the headers nor defined in the library. I don't know exactly when
the library function was first introduced, but I do know libc-5.0
does not have it, while libc-5.3 does. If you have an old library
you must invoke the system call directly, using code such as:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#include &lt;linux/unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/sysctl.h&gt;
/* now "_sysctl(struct __sysctl_args *args)"
   can be called */
_syscall1(int, _sysctl, struct __sysctl_args *,
        args);
</pre>


The system call gets a single argument instead of six of them, and
the mismatch in the prototypes is solved by prepending an
underscore to the name of the system call. Therefore, the system
call is <b  >_sysctl</b> and gets one argument, while the
library function is <b  >sysctl</b> and gets six
arguments. The sample code introduced in this article uses the
library function.
</p><p>The six arguments of the <b  >sysctl</b> library
function have the following meaning:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><b  >name</b> points to an array of
integers: each of the integer values identifies a sysctl item,
either a directory or a leaf node file. The symbolic names for such
values are defined in the file linux/sysctl.h.</p></li><li><p><b  >nlen</b> states how many integer
numbers are listed in the array <b  >name</b>. To reach a
particular entry you need to specify the path through the
subdirectories, so you need to specify the length of this
path.</p></li><li><p><b  >oldval</b> is a pointer to a data
buffer where the old value of the sysctl item must be stored. If it
is <b  >NULL</b>, the system call won't return values to
user space.</p></li><li><p><b  >oldlenp</b> points to an integer
number stating the length of the <b  >oldval</b> buffer.
The system call changes the value to reflect how much data has been
written, which can be less than the buffer length.</p></li><li><p><b  >newval</b> points to a data buffer
hosting replacement data. The kernel will read this buffer to
change the sysctl entry being acted upon. If it is
<b  >NULL</b>, the kernel value is not changed.</p></li><li><p><b  >newlen</b> is the length of
<b  >newval</b>. The kernel will read no more than
<b  >newlen</b> bytes from
<b  >newval</b>.</p></li></ol></div><p>Now, let's write some C code to access the four parameters
contained in /proc/sys/kernel/printk. The numeric name of the file
is KERN_PRINTK, within the directory CTL_KERN/ (both symbols are
defined in linux/sysctl.h). The code shown in
<a href="2365l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>, pkparms.c, is the
complete program to access these values.</p><p>Changing sysctl values is similar to reading them&mdash;just use
<b  >newval</b> and <b  >newlen</b>. A program
similar to pkparms.c can be used to change the console log level,
the first number in kernel/printk. The program is called
setlevel.c, and the code at its core looks like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int newval[1];
int newlen = sizeof(newval);
/* assign newval[0] */
error = sysctl (name, namelen, NULL /* oldval */,
         0 /* len */, newval, newlen);
</pre><p>The program overwrites only the first
<b  >sizeof(int)</b> bytes of the kernel entry, which is
exactly what we want.
</p><p>Please remember that the printk parameters are not exported
to <span   class="bold"><b>sysctl</b></span> in version 2.0 of the
kernel. The programs won't compile under 2.0 due to the missing
KERN_PRINTK symbol; also, if you compile either of them against
later versions and then run under 2.0, you'll get an error when
invoking sysctl.</p><p>The source files for pkparms.c, setlevel.c and hname.c (which
will be introduced in a while) are in the 2365.tgz1 file.</p><p>A simple run of the two programs introduced above looks like
the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# ./pkparms
len is 16 bytes
6       4       1       7
# cat /proc/sys/kernel/printk
6       4       1       7
# ./setlevel 8
# ./pkparms
len is 16 bytes
8       4       1       7
</pre><p>If you run kernel 2.0, don't despair&mdash;the files acting on
kernel/printk are just samples, and the same code can be used to
access any sysctl item available in 2.0 kernels with minimal
modifications.
</p><p>On the same ftp site you'll also find hname.c, a bare-bones
<span   class="bold"><b>hostname</b></span> command based on sysctl.
The source works with the 2.0 kernels and demonstrates how to
invoke the system call with no library support, since my Linux-2.0
runs on a libc-5.0-based PC.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bd7580.0x1cc7bd0"></a>A Quick Look at Some sysctl Entries</h2></div></div><p>Although low-level, the tunable parameters of the kernel are
very interesting to tweak and can help optimize system performance
for the different environments where Linux is used.</p><p>The following list is an overview of some relevant /kernel
and /vm files in /proc/sys. (This information applies to all
kernels from 2.0 through 2.1.35.)</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>kernel/panic</b></span> - The
integer value is the number of seconds the system will wait before
automatic reboot in case of system panic. A value of 0 means
&ldquo;disabled&rdquo;. Automatic reboot is an interesting feature to turn on
for unattended systems. The command-line option
<b  >panic=<i><tt>value</tt></i></b> can be
used to set this parameter at boot time.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>kernel/file-max</b></span> -
The maximum number of open files in the system.
<b  >file-nr</b>, on the other hand, is the per-process
maximum and can't be modified, because it is constrained by the
hardware page size. Similar entries exist for the inodes: a
system-wide entry and an immutable per-process one. Servers with
many processes and many open files might benefit by increasing the
value of these two entries.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>kernel/securelevel</b></span>
- This is a hook for security features in the system. The
securelevel file is currently read-only even for root, so it can
only be changed by program code (e.g., modules). Only the EXT2 file
system uses securelevel&mdash;it refuses to change file flags (like
<b  >immutable</b> and <b  >append-only</b>) if
securelevel is greater than 0. This means that a kernel,
precompiled with a non-zero securelevel and no support for modules,
can be used to protect precious files from corruption in case of
network intrusions. But stay tuned for new features of
securelevel.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>vm/freepages</b></span> -
Contains three numbers, all counts of free pages. The first number
is the minimum free space in the system. Free pages are needed to
fulfill atomic allocation requests, like incoming network packets.
The second number is the level at which to start heavy swapping,
and the third is the level to start light swapping. A network
server with high bandwidth benefits from higher numbers in order to
avoid dropping packets due to free memory shortage. By default, one
percent of the memory is kept free.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>vm/bdflush</b></span> - The
numbers in this file can fine-tune the behaviour of the buffer
cache. They are documented in fs/buffer.c.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>vm/kswapd</b></span> - This
file exists in all of the 2.0.x kernels, but has been removed in
2.1.33 as not useful. It can safely be ignored.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>vm/swapctl</b></span> - This
big file encloses all the parameters used in fine-tuning the
swapping algorithms. The fields are listed in
include/linux/swapctl.h and are used in mm/swap.c.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bd7580.0x1cc8678"></a>The Programming Interface: Plugging New
Features</h2></div></div><p>Module writers can easily add their own tunable features to
/proc/sys by using the programming interface to extend the control
tree. The kernel exports to modules the following two
functions:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
struct ctl_table_header *
        register_sysctl_table(ctl_table * table,
        int insert_at_head);
void unregister_sysctl_table(
        struct ctl_table_header * table);
</pre><p>The former function is used to register a &ldquo;table&rdquo; of
entries and returns a token, which is used by the latter function
to detach (unregister) your table. The argument
<b  >insert_at_head</b> tells whether the new table must
be inserted before or after the other ones, and you can easily
ignore the issue and specify 0, which means &ldquo;not at head&rdquo;.
</p><p>What is the <b  >ctl_table</b> type? It is a
structure made up of the following fields:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >int ctl_name</b> - This is a numeric
ID, unique within each table.</p></li><li><p><b  >const char *procname</b> - If the
entry must be visible through /proc, this is the corresponding
name.</p></li><li><p><b  >void *data</b> - The pointer to
data. For example, it will point to an integer value for integer
items.</p></li><li><p><b  >int maxlen</b> - The size of the
data pointed to by the previous field; for example,
<b  >sizeof(int)</b>.</p></li><li><p><b  >mode_t mode</b> - The mode of the
file. Directories should have the executable bit turned on (e.g.,
<b  >0555</b> octal).</p></li><li><p><b  >ctl_table *child</b> - For
directories, the child table. For leaf nodes,
<b  >NULL</b>.</p></li><li><p><b  >proc_handler *proc_handler</b> - The
handler is in charge of performing any read/write spawned by /proc
files. If the item has no <b  >procname</b>, this field
is not used.</p></li><li><p><b  >ctl_handler *strategy</b> - This
handler reads/writes data when the system call is used.</p></li><li><p><b  >struct proc_dir_entry *de</b> - Used
internally.</p></li><li><p><b  >void *extra1, *extra2</b> - These
fields have been introduced in version 1.3.69 and are used to
specify extra information for specific handlers. The kernel has an
handler for integer vectors, for example, that uses the extra
fields to be notified about the allowable minimum and maximum
allowed values for each number in the array.</p></li></ul></div><p>Well, the previous list may have scared most readers.
Therefore, I won't show the prototypes for the handling functions
and will instead switch directly to some sample code. Writing code
is much easier than understanding it, because you can start by
copying lines from existing files. The resulting code will fall
under the GPL&mdash;of course, I don't see that as a
disadvantage.</p><p>Let's write a module with two integer parameters, called
<b  >ontime</b> and <b  >offtime</b>. The
module will busy-loop for a few timer ticks and sleep for a few
more; the parameters control the duration of each state. Yes, this
<span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> silly, but it is the simplest
hardware-independent example I could imagine.</p><p>The parameters will be put in /proc/sys/kernel/busy, a new
directory. To this end, we need to register a tree like the one
shown in Figure 1. The /kernel directory won't be created by
<b  >register_sysctl_table</b>, because it already
exists. Also, it won't be deleted at <b  >unregister</b>
time, because it still has active child files; thus, by specifying
the whole tree of directories you can add files to every directory
within /proc/sys.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2365f1.jpg"></div><p><a href="2365l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a> is the interesting
part of <b  >busy.c</b>, which does all the work related
to sysctl. The trick here is leaving all the hard work to
<b  >proc_dointvec</b> and
<b  >sysctl_intvec</b>. These handlers are exported only
by version 2.1.8 and later of the kernel, so you need to copy them
into your module (or implement something similar) when compiling
for older kernels.</p><p>I won't show the code related to busy looping here, because
it is completely out of the scope of this article. Once you have
downloaded the source from the FTP site1, it can be compiled on
your own system. It works with both version 2.0 and 2.1 on the
Intel, Alpha and SPARC platforms.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bd7580.0x1fdd0b8"></a>Probing Further</h2></div></div><p>Despite the usefulness of
<span   class="bold"><b>sysctl</b></span>, it's hard to find
documentation. This is not a concern for system programmers, who
are accustomed to peeking at the source code to extract
information. The main entry points to the sysctl internals are
kernel/sysctl.c and net/sysctl_net.c. Most items in the sysctl
tables act on solely on strings or arrays of integers. So to search
through the whole source tree for an item, you will end up using
the <b  >data</b> field as the argument to
<span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span>. I see no shortcut to this
method.</p><p>As an example, let's trace the meaning of
<b  >ip_log_martians</b> in /proc/sys/net/ipv4. You'll
first find that sysctl_net.c refers to
<b  >ipv4_table</b>, which in turn is exported by
sysctl_net_ipv4.c. This file in turn includes the following entry
in its table:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
{NET_IPV4_LOG_MARTIANS, "ip_log_martians",
&amp;ipv4_config.log_martians, sizeof(int), 0644,
NULL, &amp;proc_dointvec},
</pre><p>Understanding the role of our control file, therefore,
reduces to looking for the field
<b  >ipv4config.log_martians</b> throughout the sources.
Some grepping will show that the field is used to control verbose
reporting (via <span   class="bold"><b>printk</b></span>) of
erroneous packets received by this host.
</p><p>Unfortunately, many system administrators are not programmers
and need other sources of information. For their benefit, kernel
developers sometimes write a little documentation as a break from
writing code, and this documentation is distributed with the kernel
source. The bad news is that, sysctl is quite recent in design, and
such extra documentation is almost nonexistent.</p><p>The file Documentation/networking/Configurable is a short
introduction to <span   class="bold"><b>sysctl</b></span> (much
shorter than this article) and points to net/TUNABLE, which in turn
is a huge list of configurable parameters in the network subtree.
Unfortunately the description of each item is quite technical, so
that people who don't know the details of networking can't
proficiently tune network parameters. As I'm writing, this file is
the only source of information about system control, if you don't
count C source files.</p></div></div>
