single issue. [June, 1997] However, you spelled my name wrong in
the &ldquo;Programming with GNU Software&rdquo; article by Randyl Britten. I
take that as a lapse on my part. I should be in touch with you more
often. (I tend to just drop by the booth at occasional
conferences.)</p><p>&mdash;Andy Oram O'Reilly &amp; Associates,
Inc .andyo@ora.com</p><p>Thanks for being so understanding. Unfortunately&mdash;a-hem&mdash;I
have to take full responsibility for the spelling. It's in my
original manuscript and there was no excuse. I offer my
apologies.</p><p>&mdash;Randyl Britten britten@u.washington.edu</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1997580.0x1a8f2f0"></a>More Novice Articles</h2></div></div><p>Thanks for your seamless renewal of my subscription, even
though I had decided in favour of the new <span   class="emphasis"><em>UK Linux
World</em></span> magazine, which has now disappeared after one
issue.</p><p><i  >LJ</i> continues as well as ever, but I'd
like to add my voice to the novice lobby&mdash;more stuff for us please.
After some easily understood articles on RCS, shell scripting and
the like, you've become all technical and clever again. I'd like to
see stuff on make and gdb&mdash;I've downloaded many applications as
source archives only to find the authors assume abilities I don't
have. Stuff on the startup and shutdown scripts would also be nice.
Anyway, great magazine.</p><p>&mdash;Bob Smith bob@bank.demon.co.uk</p><p>For every opinion, there's an equal and opposite opinion.

a Linux magazine, and <span   class="bold"><b>not</b></span> move

done in the last few months.</p><p>Also, I would like to see <i  >LJ</i> become
<span   class="bold"><b>more</b></span> technical, and move away from
the novice corner type stuff, which can easily be found in more
current form in places such as <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span>,

Rubini's excellent Kernel Korner columns. Or detailed articles on
Perl and shell scripting, hardware ports to alpha or networking
(the article on ghosting in June is a nice detailed article).
[&ldquo;Ghosting Onto the Net&rdquo;, Scott Steadman, June 1997]</p><p>I understand that Linux is new in some sense, and you may
feel justified in having the &ldquo;simpler&rdquo; stuff in there, so I offer
my feedback as simply another data point for your
consideration.</p><p>&mdash;Les Schaffer godzilla@futuris.net</p><p>We strive to be balanced, offering both a Kernel Korner and a

<i  >Linux Journal</i>. [&ldquo;Consistent Keyboard
Configuration&rdquo;, John Bunch] The article as published by
<i  >LJ</i> had several typos. I was able to get most
everything to work as described. Did not have much luck with the
arrow keys in Emacs running in an xterm. I have not been able to
determine the cause of this. Something to do with the xterm
translations?</p><p>&mdash;W. Paul Mills wpmills@sound.net</p><p>Note that on page 54, six lines are broken, forcing &ldquo;Arrow&rdquo;
onto the following line. These lines should be joined so that
&ldquo;Arrow&rdquo; is inside the comment. Also note that the escape
sequences are incorrect. The double backslashes should all be
single backslashes, so for example, the line for F117 should
read:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
string F117 = "\033\033[A" # Alt-Up Arrow
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>This type of error is present throughout the
article. On page 57, the key translation lines have two problems.
First, all of the double backslashes should be changed to single
backslashes. Second, the lines were broken improperly. The first
seven lines are shown in Listing 1.</em></span>
</p><p><a href="2434l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Keyboard
Corrections</a></p><p>Copy the rest of the lines from the man page for xterm(1).
Every line of the translations, except for the last line, should
end with either <b  >\n\</b> or <b  >\</b>.
Typographical errors here are very serious, because they cause
problems without generating any error messages.</p><p>Let me know if this helps.</p><p>&mdash;John F.

Issue 37, in particular the native PowerPC article [&ldquo;Native Linux
on the PowerPC&rdquo;, Cort Dougan, May 1997]. There was a performance
listing which compared MKLinux, native Linux-PPC and OSF and some
Sun operating systems, but the table was typeset all wrong. Being
so cryptic it is almost, if not completely, useless since one
cannot tell which digits belong to which columns. If you have so
many problems getting your magazine printed correctly, you should
probably hire better people, like me for instance.</p><p>&mdash;Ville Voutilainen vjv@stekt.oulu.fi</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1997580.0x1a90210"></a>Think Linux</h2></div></div><p>Hello. My name is Giacomo Maestranzi. I am from Italy and I
am a frequent reader of <i  >Linux Journal</i> because
I find it very interesting&mdash;especially the last issue (June 1997)
which covered Linux use in my region (TRENTINO ALTO ADIGE and the
city is BOLZANO). [&ldquo;Traveling Linux&rdquo;, Maurizio Cachia] What I
just have to say is that I love Linux and everything related to it,
and I have created a slogan for it that I would like to see in a
future issue. The slogan is:</p><p>THINK FREE...... THINK BIG.......THINK LINUX</p><p>Thank you again for <i  >LJ</i>. I apologize for
my English, but this is my best.</p><p>&mdash;Giacomo Maestranzi hoteuropeo@well.it</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1997580.0x1a904d0"></a>Push Media</h2></div></div><p>Kudos to Doc Searls for his insight into how the WWW has the
&ldquo;mainstream media/advertisers&rdquo; scrambling to remain a monopoly.
[&ldquo;Shoveling Push Media&rdquo;, June 1997]</p><p>I have been an active WWW user for about 2 years&mdash;started on
AOL as a newbie and graduated to a direct ISP. I am not interested
in push technology. My senses are offended often enough when I turn
on the TV or radio. Push technology will appeal only to the &ldquo;couch
potatoes&rdquo; of the world who purchase WebTVs to impress their
technophobic friends. I say leave TV on the TV.</p><p>The beauty of the WWW is that I can control what I see. If I
find a site uninteresting, I leave. The other compelling aspect of
using the Web is that I can remove the classic &ldquo;middle man&rdquo; from
my business transactions. When I want to buy something using the
Web, I go straight to the person(s) who offers it. I do not have to
be offended, goaded or otherwise angered by traditional
advertising. This fact scares technologically savvy advertisers. I
would be scared too, but that is the reason I write software for a
living.</p><p>&mdash;Jeffery C. Cann jc_cann@ix.netcom.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1997580.0x1a906e0"></a>Perfect Box</h2></div></div><p>Eric Raymond's article, &ldquo;Building the Perfect Box&rdquo; (April,
1997) was quite instructive, but he did not mention one essential
component&mdash;the keyboard. In my experience, this is one place you
should not skimp. A bad keyboard is frustrating to use and may
contribute to carpal tunnel syndrome. I like the top-of-the-line
IBM keyboards, but you should always try one out before you buy it.
When you experiment, you should sit in the same position you use
when typing.</p><p>By the way, if there is anyone out there who does not have
Raymond's book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The New Hacker's Dictionary</em></span>,
go out and buy it right now.</p><p>&mdash;James R. Miller jimxc@jimxc.seanet.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1997580.0x1a908f0"></a>Wireless Solution</h2></div></div><p>I read the &ldquo;Linux Means Business&rdquo; column with interest this
month [&ldquo;Connecting SSC via Wireless Modem&rdquo;, Liem Bahneman, May
1997], as I have recently switched from an analog modem to a
wireless solution for net access to the office from home. I
recommend Metricom's Ricochet service (http://www.ricochet.net/)
very highly. I consistently receive transfer rates of 2.5 to
3.5KB/s, and it is child's play to use it under Linux; it supports
the standard Hayes AT command set. I've never received a busy
signal and establishing a connection is lightning fast compared to
an analog modem's handshake.</p><p>&mdash;Nick Silberstein nick@fusion.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1997580.0x1a90a50"></a>Wabi Article</h2></div></div><p>I was surprised to see in the Wabi product review by Dwight
Johnson (<i  >LJ</i>, June 1997) a suggestion to
<b  >chmod&lt;\!s&gt;666 /dev/fd0</b>. Giving random
users permission to write to your floppy drive is not exactly a
good thing to do.</p><p>Also, near the end of the article, it was mentioned that one
should wait for Wabi 3.0 to drive 24-bit displays. Last time I
checked, Caldera's Wabi 2.4c (not yet released) should fix the
24-bit display problem.</p><p>As for the &ldquo;seamless integration of Microsoft Windows with
Linux,&rdquo; I personally find Wabi's handling of the focus most
annoying. For Windows tasks that take time to complete, you can
easily create havoc by focusing on a Linux window to do something,
just to be interrupted in the middle by a &ldquo;regain of focus&rdquo; by a
Wabi task. For machines with a lot of memory (and therefore the
ability to run two X servers), I find running Wabi on a separate X
server to be the safest.</p><p>(The article also did not cover keyboard remapping; the
information on keyboard remapping found on Caldera's web site is
not exactly helpful.)</p><p>&mdash;Ambrose Liac li@acli%interlog.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1997580.0x1e88fb8"></a>Security and Networking</h2></div></div><p>I just received your recent issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, and it was very helpful and informative. [&ldquo;The
SYN Denial of Service&rdquo;, Douglas Stewart, et al., June 1997] I do
have some problems with the SYN denial of service prevention. The
source was published in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Phrack</em></span> magazine, and
also includes the methods of prevention (which were the same as you
had discussed in <i  >LJ</i>). Unfortunately, TCP SYN
flooding is only one of many attacks; there is also Project Hades
which deals with TCP exploitation, and Project Loki which presents
the theory of ICMP_ECHO tunneling. These are just the articles I
have read. If you want to stay ahead in the security field, read
these articles as they also contain methods of prevention.

company's use of Progress on Linux. [&ldquo;Sticking with Progress&rdquo;,
Peter Struijk and Lydia Kinata, September 1996]</p><p>As an international non-profit organization, we have used SCO
Unix for 8 years and have been very pleased with it, except for the
growing resources needed to run it, as well as the cost to buy and
upgrade it.</p><p>At our international meetings in London last month, we
decided to do some testing with Linux to see if it works in our
environment and if it could be used as a replacement for our office
networking systems. Our German office has been running nicely on
Linux for several months, but has yet to get the Progress kit for
testing.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Did you have a shared library from SCO or did you
have to buy the license to make running Progress legal?</p></li><li><p>Are you running Progress 7 or 8 now?</p></li></ol></div><p>We are looking at linking Progress with &ldquo;static binding&rdquo; to
eliminate the need for the shared libraries, since we have the full
development kit.</p><p>Progress says it will probably never support Linux directly
since there is no standards body to refer to as there is with its
commercial counterparts.</p><p>&mdash;Ron Tenny ron@omusa.om.org</p><p>We actually use the free libraries distributed with iBCS:
that is, they are available in a separate archive. The only two we
need are libc_s and libnsl_s. I believe we still have an (old) SCO
license, but we never had a need to use the original libs (although
they work fine, too).</p><p>We are still running V6, but I've heard reports from the east
coast and Canada that V7 and V8 can be run on Linux without (major)
problems.</p><p>To join our mailing list for Linux Progress users, send
e-mail to info@linuxjournal.com with one line in the body
containing the word &ldquo;info&rdquo;.</p><p>&mdash;Peter Struijk info@linuxjournal.com</p></div></div>
