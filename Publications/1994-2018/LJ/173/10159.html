Get two terminals in the space of one with split screens on a
number of different command-line tools.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15bb580.0x16b33b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Even with the high-resolution flat-screen monitors we have these days,
screen real estate still can be at a premium. Of course, if
you spend a lot of your time in a terminal, this is even more true. When
you want to compare two files at the same time or monitor two different
sessions at once, you either carefully position terminal windows or rely
on tabs.
</p><p>
Tabs can be fine, but when I use terminals, I like to stick to the
keyboard as much as possible. Plus, I don't know about anyone else,
but for me, there are four main programs I run in terminals: mutt,
vim, screen and irssi. Luckily for me, all of these programs support some form
of split screens&mdash;the ability to divide the terminal either vertically
or horizontally. Although these features aren't necessarily anything new,
if you don't use them every day, it can be hard to remember how to split
the screen, navigate between the sections, and then go back to a single
screen. In this column, I discuss the split-screen features
in my four favorite terminal applications and provide a simple guide to
help us all commit them to memory.

Mutt Pager Indexes</h2></div></div><p>
I suppose if you want to be technical, this isn't exactly the same as
the split screens in the other tools, but while you are in the mutt pager
(the part that lets you view the body of an e-mail message), by default,
mutt fills the entire terminal with the e-mail. If you want, however, you can
tell mutt to take a specified number of lines at the top and use them
to display your index. This way, you can browse through the contents of
an e-mail message but still be able to keep an eye on the other headers in your
index. To use ten lines for this feature, simply add the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
set pager_index_lines=10
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15bb580.0x16b3778"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to your ~/.muttrc.

Vim Splits</h2></div></div><p>
Vim is my favorite text editor (I've used it for basically all of my
writing), and its split-screen feature is especially useful for sysadmin
work. I can't count how many times I've made a change in one configuration
file or script that I've wanted to add to a second file. To enable
split-screen mode for a horizontal split, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
:split
</pre>
</p><p>
And, for a vertical split, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
:vsplit
</pre>
</p><p>
By default, vim shows the same file in both
panes. Press Ctrl-W, and then use the regular HJKL keys (or arrow keys
if you aren't a home-row junkie like me) to navigate between panes. So,
if I had made a horizontal split and wanted to open a new file in the
bottom pane, I would press Ctrl-W J to move the cursor to that pane, and
then I would type <tt  >:open
<i>filename</i></tt> to open the new file. When you are finished
with a particular pane, make sure the cursor is in that pane, and
then save and close the file in the normal fashion.
</p><p>
Vim isn't limited only to two panes either&mdash;simply type the
<tt  >:split</tt> or
<tt  >:vsplit</tt> command again to add a third horizontal or vertical pane,
respectively. You even can split the window horizontally and then type
<tt  >:vsplit</tt> to split that pane further into two vertical panes.

Split Screen</h2></div></div><p>
Screen is another one of those indispensable command-line tools. If you
haven't used screen before, it essentially allows you to open multiple
numbered shells, and you can switch to them with Ctrl-A
<span   class="emphasis"><em>&lt;number&gt;</em></span>. Then, you can
detach from your screen session and connect to it later, and in
the meantime, all the shells you have opened within it keep their
state. One way I commonly use screen is for irssi, a command-line-based
IRC client. I open irssi within screen on a server that is always up.
Then,
no matter where I am, I can connect to the remote server and resume my
irssi session, which always stays connected.
</p><p>
Beyond the standard screen features, screen also supports a horizontal
split screen. This can be useful if you want to monitor IRC in one window
and perform other commands in the second. Also, if you use a text editor
or other tools that don't support split panes on their own, you can use
screen's split feature as a supplement.
</p><p>
To split the pane within screen, press Ctrl-A Shift-S. Then, you can press Ctrl-A
Tab to move your cursor between the two panes. You will notice that the
bottom pane is empty at the beginning. Once you have moved the cursor to it,
you either can switch to a currently open window with Ctrl-A
<span   class="emphasis"><em>&lt;number&gt;</em></span>,
or you can press Ctrl-A C to create a new window in that pane. Screen also
supports multiple panes. Simply press Ctrl-A Shift-S a second time to split the
session into three equally sized panes. When you are ready to close a
pane, press Ctrl-A Tab until it has the cursor, and then press Ctrl-A
Shift-X to close
that pane.

Irssi Split</h2></div></div><p>
Irssi is definitely my favorite IRC client, and I probably spend as much
time in it as I do in any other command-line program. It also supports
an interesting split-screen feature that takes some getting used
to. Basically, each channel you join in irssi ends up in its own numbered
window. On my setup, I always have particular channels set to open in a
particular window, so when I press Alt-7, for instance, I always will go
to #linuxjournal. Sometimes you have a lot of activity going on
in more than one channel and want to monitor all of them. So, for
instance, if I want to view both #linuxjournal (in window 7) and #nblug
(in window 4), and I already am in #nblug, I could type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/window show 7
</pre>
</p><p>
Now the irssi screen splits in half with #linuxjournal on the top
and #nblug on the bottom. If I want to chat in #linuxjournal, I
press Alt-7 to make sure it is selected (the topic header on irssi
updates to show the currently selected window). Then, if I want to chat
in #nblug, I press Alt-4.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10159f3.large.jpg"><img src="10159f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Irssi with Two Windows
</p></div></div><p>
Irssi split windows become interesting once you start switching beyond
two windows. Going back to the example, if I press Alt-5 now (my
#knoppix window),
the bottom window changes to that channel. By default, irssi
makes the top window in a split screen &ldquo;sticky&rdquo;, so that it appears
no matter what other windows you switch to along the bottom. If I 
want to turn off sticky mode for that window I would type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/window stick 7 off
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, when I switch between windows with the Alt key, the top or bottom
window switches, depending on which had focus last. If I want to
stick #linuxjournal on the top again, I type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/window stick 7
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you are finished with your split screen (or if you are getting
confused and want to turn it off), type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/window hide
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15bb580.0x16b4958"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to hide the currently selected window. If that window is sticky, it won't
be able to hide until you turn off stickiness with <tt  >/window
stick off</tt>.
</p><p>
Now, what would a column about splits be if I didn't show an
insanely complicated nested set of split screens? Note that I don't
advocate actually using a setup like the following on a daily basis,
but Figure 4 shows what happens when you split screen into two windows, open
a split irssi on the top window and a vertically split vim on the bottom.
I hope these split-screen features help you stay organized and
productive.
