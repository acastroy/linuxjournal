Recently released into the public domain, djbdns is a fast and secure replacement for BIND.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16e2580.0x17da300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Let's face it, DNS is not the most sexy component of the Internet's
infrastructure. It is an old technology and doesn't get the same
attention as newer, more flashy tools and software. Your Web site visitors
may comment on how cool your new AJAX widget is, but I guarantee they will
never tell the world how pleased they are with your DNS response time.
</p><p>
Nevertheless, DNS is crucial to the Internet. It is one of those services
that always should &ldquo;just work&rdquo;, and it's only when it doesn't work
that people
notice (and complain, loudly). Readers may remember the great &ldquo;Google
vanishing act&rdquo; in May 2005, when the search engine giant briefly
disappeared from the Internet. Many quickly assumed the site had been
hacked, but the problem turned out to be a DNS configuration issue. The
mishap was fixed quickly, but it highlighted how even the mightiest of
the mighty can be crippled easily by a simple misconfiguration.
</p><p>
My primary goal for this article is to demonstrate that there is a free,
secure and easy-to-configure alternative to BIND: djbdns. This article is
intended for people who may have some experience with DNS, but who would like
to consider new approaches. I assume only a basic understanding of
DNS&mdash;specifically, familiarity with the basic record types, such as A, CNAME,
MX, NS and SOA, as well as the concept of a TTL (time to live).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16e2580.0x17da670"></a>
A Brief History of BIND and djbdns</h2></div></div><p>
For the first 15 years of the Internet as we know it, there was only
one real choice when it came to DNS server software: BIND. BIND began life
as a project by several graduate students at the University of California,
Berkeley (thus the acronym, the Berkeley Internet Name Domain). In
the early 1990s, the Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) was created to 
maintain, distribute and support this critical software formally. The ISC released
BIND 8 in May 1997 as a major update to the aging BIND 4. Although there
were major configuration differences, both BIND 4 and 8 were based on the
original Berkeley code from the early and mid-1980s. While trying to raise
funding for a major rewrite, one of BIND's authors described this code as
&ldquo;sleazeware produced in a drunken fury&rdquo;. A new team worked on the rewrite
for several years, and BIND 9 was released formally in September 2000.
</p><p>
After years of dealing with security problems in BIND and frustration
with its configuration syntax, Dan J. Bernstein began work on djbdns in
1999. Bernstein (or DJB as he is commonly known) already had made a name
for himself as the author of qmail, the mail server software that was
quickly gaining popularity among system administrators. At the time,
Sendmail was the dominant mail server on the Internet, and, like BIND,
it was notoriously difficult to configure and had a history of security
problems. Bernstein's &ldquo;thinking outside the box&rdquo; design decisions
about security and configuration simplicity not only catapulted qmail
to success, but it also affected the way developers thought about writing
software for the increasingly volatile Internet (Postfix, Courier and
others were inspired by qmail's security partitioning design). Now that
Bernstein had secured and simplified mail, it was time to do the same for
DNS. The first alpha of djbdns was released in December 1999, and the
current version, djbdns 1.05, eventually was released on February 11,
2001. That's right, the current version is more than seven years old. Remember,
DNS is an old protocol, and it doesn't change very often. BIND software
updates almost always are for bugfixes or security patches.
</p><p>
In the past, Bernstein's software was controversial because it lacked
an explicit license. OS vendors were reluctant to distribute his packages
because of the uncertainty around its licensing. However, in December
2007, Bernstein placed djbdns (as well as daemontools and qmail) into the
public domain, allowing people to use or distribute it as they see fit.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16e2580.0x17da8d8"></a>
Why djbdns?</h2></div></div><p>
BIND has been around since the earliest days of the Internet. It's
still the most popular DNS server out there, so why should you consider
switching to djbdns? For one, djbdns does not have BIND's history
of problems. BIND's security record is on par with Sendmail's (not
something to be proud of), and configuring it beyond the basics can be
downright painful.
</p><p>
To complicate things further, BIND blurs the distinction between the
different functions of DNS. There are two primary types of DNS services:
DNS caches (also called recursive DNS servers) and DNS servers (also
called authoritative servers or name servers).
</p><p>
A DNS cache is what your desktop computer talks to when it needs to find
the address for a Web site you are trying to reach. When a cache receives
your request for the location of www.google.com, it first checks to see whether
it already knows the answer to your question. If it does, it quickly
tells you. If it does not know the answer already, it begins by first
asking the root servers for the answer. The root servers respond with
something similar to &ldquo;I don't know the answer but the .com servers
might;
here are their addresses, go ask them.&rdquo; The caching server continues
doing this until it has the IP for www.google.com, and then it returns
the answer to your computer. The IP addresses you see in /etc/resolv.conf
are for DNS caches. Caches talk to authoritative servers to get answers.
</p><p>
An authoritative server has a much more straightforward
responsibility. Its job is simply to publish information from domains
for which it is &ldquo;authoritative&rdquo;. An authoritative server will
give answers only to questions about domains for which it has been
explicitly configured. For example, ns1.google.com (one of Google's
authoritative DNS servers) never will answer a request for the address of
www.microsoft.com (unless Microsoft and Google merge some day).
</p><p>
Although these are completely different services, BIND uses the same
server for both. This may seem handy, but it complicates the configuration
and quickly can become a security headache.
</p><p>
On the other hand, djbdns adheres to the UNIX philosophy of &ldquo;do one thing,
and do it well&rdquo;. The server components of djbdns are separated, with dnscache
as the caching component and tinydns as the authoritative server (I
detail the advantages of each shortly).
</p><p>
This separation allows each program to run individually chrooted as its
own unprivileged user. If an attacker is able to crash your DNS cache, it
will not impact your authoritative DNS service. A side effect of this
is that dnscache and tinydns need separate IP addresses, so that each
may bind to port 53. You can't run both on the same IP address.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16e2580.0x17dad50"></a>
Installing djbdns</h2></div></div><p>
The latest version of djbdns compiles on all the major Linux
distributions. You also need to install daemontools (see sidebar),
another package by Dan Bernstein.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16e2580.0x17dae58"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>daemontools</b></p><p>
daemontools is a collection of tools for managing UNIX services. 
Like most of Dan Bernstein's software, djbdns relies on daemontools.
</p><p>
daemontools services are created in directories, and they must contain an 
executable script named run. To start a service, you simply create
a symbolic link from that directory into /service. Within five seconds,
the svscan process will notice the new service, start it and begin
monitoring it.
</p><p>
Logging is handled by the multilog program from the daemontools package. 
Anything written to standard output by the program is recorded in the
processes log file, named current. Typically, the logs are stored
within the service directory. For example, dnscache's logs would be
in /service/dnscache/log/main/current. multilog automatically rotates
the current file once it reaches a certain size.
</p><p>
These days, I prefer the Ubuntu server distribution, which recently 
introduced the upstart replacement for init. I've written a patch for
daemontools to make it compatible with upstart. See dnsfool.com/tips
for the patch. daemontools is available from <a href="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html" target="_self">cr.yp.to/daemontools.html</a>.
</p></div><p>
Download djbdns from Bernstein's Web site, and run the following
commands. The third line is a workaround for a glibc bug on Linux:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# tar xzf djbdns-1.05.tar.gz
# cd djbdns-1.05
# echo gcc -O2 -include /usr/include/errno.h &gt; conf-cc
# make
# make setup check
</pre>
</p><p>
See Bernstein's official documentation if you have further
questions about installing djbdns.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16e2580.0x17db2d0"></a>
Using dnscache, a DNS Cache</h2></div></div><p>
One of the easiest ways to begin using djbdns is to configure a DNS
cache on your local network. There are many reasons why you may want to
do this&mdash;from faster DNS lookup times to avoiding those pesky mistyped
domain search result pages. In either case, installing dnscache can help.
</p><p>
Let's assume you have a home network with several computers on
192.168.10.0/24. Additionally, a Linux machine (named linux1) is running
on 192.168.10.10. You want to install dnscache on linux1, so it can provide
DNS resolution service for the other machines on the network.
</p><p>
Fortunately, installing dnscache is trivial, thanks to the dnscache-conf
utility provided with djbdns. Before running dnscache-conf, you 
need to create one new group and two accounts on linux1. These will be
used exclusively by djbdns and should not be available for login:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# groupadd djbdns
# useradd -s /bin/false -d /etc/dnscache -g djbdns dnscache
# useradd -s /bin/false -d /dev/null -g djbdns dnslog
</pre>
</p><p>
The next step is to run dnscache-conf and provide it with four parameters:
the account for the dnscache process, the account for the logging
process, the dnscache service directory and the IP on which dnscache
should listen:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# dnscache-conf dnscache dnslog /etc/dnscache 192.168.10.10
</pre>
</p><p>
The /etc/dnscache directory now should exist. Before you can begin
using your new cache, you need to allow access to it from your
local network. dnscache checks to see if a machine is allowed to access
it by comparing the IP of the incoming request address against files
in /etc/dnscache/root/ip/. You can grant access to your whole network
simply by touching a single file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# touch /etc/dnscache/root/ip/192.168.10
</pre>
</p><p>
At this point, you are ready to start the cache. If you are running BIND,
you need to stop and disable it so that dnscache can take ownership
of port 53. Assuming daemontools is installed and running, you now
can start dnscache:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# ln -s /etc/dnscache /service/
</pre>
</p><p>
That's it. You now have a DNS cache running on your local network. Your
next step is to update the /etc/resolv.conf file on all your machines
to point to 192.168.10.10:

<pre     class="programlisting">
nameserver 192.168.10.10
</pre>
</p><p>
If your network is very busy, you may find you need to increase the
amount of memory that is allocated to your cache. Dan Bernstein provides
instructions on his Web site for adjusting the cache size, but you also may
want to take a look at Paul Jarc's cache-effect.pl Perl script or
Mike Babcock's dnscacheproc.py Python script.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16e2580.0x17db8a8"></a>
Using tinydns, an Authoritative DNS Server</h2></div></div><p>
If you have ever run BIND as an authoritative DNS server, it is likely that
at some point you neglected to increment the serial on an SOA record,
overlooked a missing semicolon somewhere or simply forgot to append a
period (.) at the end of a record. These are just a few of the common mistakes
people make when dealing with BIND's zone files. If you have been bitten
by any of these issues, you probably remember the trouble it created for
you. These errors can cause big headaches (just ask Google).
</p><p>
tinydns, the authoritative DNS server in djbdns, takes an entirely
different approach and makes it much more difficult to get yourself in
trouble. One major difference is that instead of separate zone files for
each domain, tinydns uses a single text file named data to store every
record of every domain. This data file is then compiled into a very
fast database in cdb format. Of course, if you prefer managing domains
in separate files, you still can, just concatenate them together before
compiling the database.
</p><p>
Let's get started by configuring our tinydns instance. You should have
daemontools already installed and running. Again, let's assume we are
running a home network on 192.168.10.0/24, and we now want to access
each host by name using DNS. We have another Linux machine (named linux2)
running on 192.168.10.20 that will publish DNS information with tinydns.
</p><p>
First, create the tinydns user:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# useradd -s /bin/false -d /etc/tinydns -g djbdns tinydns
</pre>
</p><p>
Like dnscache, there is a utility for creating and configuring instances
of tinydns. It also takes four parameters: the account for the tinydns
process, the account for the logging process, the tinydns service
directory and the IP on which tinydns should listen:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# tinydns-conf tinydns dnslog /etc/tinydns 192.168.10.20
</pre>
</p><p>
This creates the /etc/tinydns directory and populates it with
everything needed to begin publishing your DNS data. The last step is
to create a symbolic link for the tinydns service into /service. Again,
be sure to stop and disable any BIND instances first:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# ln -s /etc/tinydns/ /service/
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you can begin adding records for each host on your network.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16e2580.0x1bd4020"></a>
Adding DNS Records</h2></div></div><p>
Before we begin, let's see how our DNS data would look in the traditional
BIND zone file format (versions 8.2 and greater). Listing 1 shows
everything needed to configure forward records for example.com and
reverse records for 192.168.10.0/24. This includes the configuration
for named.conf, as well as the zone data for example.com and
10.168.192.in-addr.arpa. This clocks in at 38 lines of configuration
for our two domains.

30            IN  PTR  linux3.example.com.
</pre></div><p>
As I mentioned, tinydns takes a different approach. Instead of defining
records separately for forward and reverse zones, tinydns allows you
to combine them into single records. Listing 2 contains the exact same
configuration from Listing 1, except in tinydns format. Instead of 38
lines of configuration, we now have only ten lines. Let's go over what
these lines do.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16e2580.0x1bd43e8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. tinydns Configuration for example.com</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
# /service/tinydns/root/data
.example.com::linux2.example.com
.10.168.192.in-addr.arpa::linux2.example.com
@example.com:192.168.10.10:mail.example.com:0
=linux1.example.com:192.168.10.10

+spaghetti.example.com:192.168.10.20
+monster.example.com:192.168.10.30
Cnoodly-appendage.example.com:linux1.example.com
</pre></div><p>
The first character of each line is used to specify the type of record
or records that should be created. A period (.) line tells tinydns that it is
authoritative for example.com:

<pre     class="programlisting">
.example.com::linux2.example.com
</pre>
</p><p>
This creates an SOA (start of authority) record and sets
linux2.example.com as an NS record. If an IP address was provided between
the two colons, an A record also would have been created for
linux2.example.com with that IP address. This one @ line replaces
eight from the BIND zone file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
@example.com:192.168.10.15:mail.example.com:0
</pre>
</p><p>
This line creates two records. An A record is created for mail.example.com
with an address of 192.168.10.15, and an MX record is created for
example.com pointing to mail.example.com with a distance of 0. Now, let's
start defining our hosts:

<pre     class="programlisting">
=linux1.example.com:192.168.10.10
=linux2.example.com:192.168.10.20
=linux3.example.com:192.168.10.30
</pre>
</p><p>
These lines each create two records. For example, the first line creates
an A record for linux1.example.com with an address of 192.168.10.10 and a
PTR record (a reverse record) for 10.10.168.192.in-addr.arpa pointing
to linux1.example.com. If you manage both the forward and reverse zones
for your network, you probably already can see what a huge time-saver
this can be.
</p><p>
Finally, we define simple aliases for our hosts. Each host has an alias
that we prefer to use instead of the generic linux{1,2,3} names. To
create alias A records, we use + lines, which are exactly like =
lines, except PTR records are not created:

<pre     class="programlisting">
+flying.example.com:192.168.10.10         # alias for linux1
+spaghetti.example.com:192.168.10.30      # alias for linux2
+monster.example.com:192.168.10.30        # alias for linux3
</pre>
</p><p>
Although it's discouraged, you also could define an alias with a CNAME using a C line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Cnoodly-appendage.example.com:linux1.example.com
</pre>
</p><p>
All these records go in a single file, which in our case is
/service/tinydns/root/data. Save the file, and from that directory
run <tt  >make</tt>. This compiles the text file into data.cdb, a constant
database. If a data.cdb already exists, tinydns will continue
serving from it until the new one is ready, at which point it is moved
into place, and tinydns instantly begins using it. The Makefile simply
calls the tinydns-data command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
data.cdb: data
    /usr/local/bin/tinydns-data
</pre>
</p><p>
You can test that your new records are in the database by using the
tinydns-get utility. tinydns-get accesses the data.cdb file directly, so
you don't need to worry about your test queries being cached anywhere. For
example, you can use tinydns-get to see that your MX record is 
configured properly. First, make sure you are in the /service/tinydns/root
directory and that you have run make so that the database is up to date:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# tinydns-get mx example.com
15 example.com:
103 bytes, 1+1+1+2 records, response, authoritative, noerror
query: 15 example.com
answer: example.com 86400 MX 0 mail.example.com
authority: example.com 259200 NS linux2.example.com
additional: mail.example.com 86400 A 192.168.10.15
additional: linux2.example.com 86400 A 192.168.10.20
</pre>
</p><p>
This shows that linux2.example.com is defined as the authoritative name
server for example.com, that mail.example.com is the MX record for the
domain, and that its IP address is 192.168.10.15.

There are many other convenience features that tinydns offers. For
example, with tinydns, you do not need to remember to increment the serial
on the SOA record each time you change something in a zone file. tinydns
automatically generates serials from the last-modified timestamp on the
data file, which ensures that they are incremented whenever the file changes.
</p><p>
If you ever have had to migrate DNS for an active domain, you will
appreciate per-record timestamps. You can specify an exact time in the
future for a record to change, without worrying about how it is cached
around the Internet. tinydns dynamically calculates the TTL as it
responds to queries. For example, if you want to migrate samba.example.com
from 192.168.10.25 to 192.168.10.35 at 2 AM on October 15, 2008, you can
add the following two records:

<pre     class="programlisting">
=samba.example.com:192.168.10.25:0:4000000048f594fa
=samba.example.com:192.168.10.35::4000000048f594fa
</pre>
</p><p>
The last field on these records is a TAI64 timestamp representing
2008-10-15 02:00:00. (See Resources 
for tips on generating TAI64 timestamps.)
</p><p>
A cache that requests the A record for samba.example.com at 1:50:00 AM on
October 15, 2008, will receive a response of 192.168.10.25 with a TTL of
600 seconds (ten minutes). A cache that requests the same record at 1:59:45
AM will receive the same response, except with a TTL of 15 seconds. After
2:00 AM, tinydns will begin responding automatically with the new IP,
192.168.10.35. Because all prior responses were set to expire at exactly
2:00 AM, all caches will check back immediately for the new address.
</p><p>
It's the little things like this that make djbdns such a wonderful piece
of software.

DNS Replication</h2></div></div><p>
BIND servers use zone transfers to replicate DNS data between
servers. This process is rather complicated, has a history of problems
and is not exactly easy to configure. Instead, Bernstein recommends
using existing data transfer tools, such as rsync or scp, that are known
to be fast, efficient and secure.
</p><p>
Let's add linux3.example.com as second DNS server for the example.com
domain. Install djbdns on linux3 and configure tinydns as above (using
the appropriate IP address). Update your data file on linux2 with the
new record (anywhere in the file is fine):

<pre     class="programlisting">
.example.com::linux3.example.com
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, update /service/tinydns/root/Makefile on linux2 with the
new make target. Replace everything in the Makefile with the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
remote: data.cdb
    rsync -az -e ssh data.cdb \
        192.168.10.30:/service/tinydns/root/data.cdb
data.cdb: data
    /usr/local/bin/tinydns-data
</pre>
</p><p>
Be sure to use tabs instead of spaces at the beginning of the command
lines in your Makefile. Now, when you run make it will compile data.cdb and
immediately rsync it to linux3. We are using the IP for linux3 in the rsync
command, because DNS should not rely on itself (it would fail if your
DNS was broken). Also, you may want to create a special account for this
purpose and configure passwordless ssh access using keys. Dan Bernstein
provides more thorough instructions on his Web site for configuring
DNS replication.

DNS without the Pain</h2></div></div><p>
As I hope you have seen, DNS does not have to be a headache. Although
BIND is ubiquitous on Linux, djbdns is more secure, more efficient
and simply easier to use. And, now that it has been released into the
public domain, there are no longer any philosophical reasons for rejecting
it. We've only briefly covered what djbdns has to offer, so I hope you
will read the on-line documentation, download it and experiment with it
yourself. If you ever have found yourself babysitting a BIND instance,
you may want to consider giving djbdns a chance.
