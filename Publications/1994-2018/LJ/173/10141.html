Longtime subscriber here (from probably back in the late
90s or so).
I've spent time in various engineering, IT and support positions
during, before and after college to end up where I am now, and along
the way, I've continually found my ideal notebook shrinking further
and further, and my tolerance of bootup times shrinking
proportionately.
</p><p>
This finally came to a head in 2004, when your hardware reviewer
test-drove the Sharp Actius MM10, arguably the pinnacle of all
ultramobile notebooks that came before. I was convinced and bought
one from the same folks that supplied yours (in fact, I bought the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>actual</em></span> review unit your reviewer used). I immediately fell in
love with it for various reasons, and it followed me across the
country several times, from Alaska to Florida, from the US to India
and back. I became hooked to its light usefulness, and the 7.5&ndash;8
hours
on the 9-cell battery. I patched my kernel with laptop mode, tweaked
my journal commit times, and learned to love Xfce and later Fluxbox. I
could power and boot fully in less than 30 seconds (though I later added
some nice convenient things that lengthened it, but it still was less than
one
minute). I got used to its weird little keyboard and learned how
rarely I actually use an optical drive. I turned in lessons, then
later administered remote servers, and yet later wrote code in vim via
a VPN connection over wireless to the office from outdoors, airports and
friends' houses (truly&mdash;how boring a guest am I?).
</p><p>
This was all fantastic and magical until its motherboard decided to
stop playing nice with IDE devices sometime in late 2006. Nothing else
on the market came close. There was no direct replacement. Well, some came
close, but their 12" screens wouldn't fit the accessories I'd
accumulated over time, or their low-power modes wouldn't yield the
same battery life with their high-capacity batteries, or not all of
their hardware had kernel support, or they cost way too much. I felt
utterly abandoned by the industry, which seemed to assume that folks
with my needs are obviously in the market for an overpriced tablet PC,
essentially the only machines attempting to meet the MM10's form factor
and feature set.
</p><p>
Then, sometime last year, something interesting, amazing and incredible
happened. For completely tangential reasons, the industry saw fit to
meet this exact market and form factor, and then one-up me by
competing on price as well! Since then, I've tried to follow this
mini-notebook trend, largely publicized via OLPC's XO, then later
ASUS's Eee PC 700. And, the movement got a name&mdash;the netbook. I'm
not sure I'm sold on this name, but it is certainly adequate, and at
least I can tell the world that what I've been looking for has a name.
</p><p>
One great thing is these netbooks recognized that your typical desktop
distribution (further, <span   class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span> operating system available) didn't
really cater to a highly mobile audience and heavily customized them
to address this issue. Hence, full GNU/Linux support is a foregone
issue. Astounding! So, I have hope, and I'm in the market for an MM10
replacement now. It shouldn't be too hard, because most of the new
models out-sport comparable specs in most areas and exceed in others
(I'll take your 15G hard drive, and double it as an SSD, no less).
</p><p>
What about the HP 2133 Mini-Note KX872AA? How about the MSI Wind? Any
implementations of the new VIA OpenBook reference implementation? The
new Eee PC 900? The brand-new mystery Dell netbook that everyone's
salivating over now? There are others I know nothing about, I'm sure.
How about a netbook showdown?

Joshua's response to my showdate tech tip is indeed very helpful [see
Letters in the March 2008 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>].
Frankly, I was not aware of the versatility of GNU's date program. I wrote
showdate a long time ago and have used it for doing all sorts of date
arithmetic, and I thought it would be nice to share it with others.
showdate,
however, is not broken or quirky, and if someone does find a bug in it, please contact me at <a href="mailto:ssahore@yahoo.com">ssahore@yahoo.com</a>. It certainly has
room for improvement&mdash;for example, the
ability to change its datum or use string-valued symbols, such as now,
before, after, ago and so forth.

I would like to suggest an alternative solution for the image resizing
script presented by Dave Taylor in his Work the Shell column in the June
2008 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>.
</p><p>
The basic script on page 29 contains nine calls to system utilities.
That means every loop cycle will start nine separate processes. This is
the price for the string splitting and the floating-point arithmetic used,
which can be completely avoided by two simple tricks. What remains is
a solution with one call to file. This will save about 70% runtime when used in a loop running more than 100 arbitrary image files:


<pre     class="programlisting">
declare -i multiplier=75  # in percent (integer)

filename="edit.png"

string=( $(file "$filename") )  # make an array from output
width=${string[4]}  # select width
height=${string[6]}  # select height
height=${height/,/}  # remove trailing comma

let width=($width*$multiplier)/100  # new width
let height=($height*$multiplier)/100  # new height

echo "$filename scaled: width=$width height=$height"
</pre>

Everything shown in Dave Taylor's July 2008 Work the Shell
column using combinations of
sed/grep/cut/etc can be drastically simplified, not to mention lighten
the load on the system.
</p><p>
To grab the initial top list of films:


<pre     class="programlisting">
curl -s http://www.imdb.com/chart/top | \
 sed -e 's/&gt;/&gt;\
/g' | \
 sed -n -e 's/.*\(\/title\/tt.*\/\).*/http:\/\/www.imdb.com\1/pg' &gt;
top250.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
To fetch the titles:



<pre     class="programlisting">

curl -s "$1" | \
 sed -n -e '/&lt;title&gt;/s/&lt;title&gt;\(.*\) (\([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\)).*/\1 |
\2/p'

</pre>
</p><p>
And, finally, please&mdash;cat'ing a file into a pipeline that then uses
head to peel off a subset of lines?

<pre     class="programlisting">
for name in $(head -10 top250.txt)
do
 sh ./getfileinfo.sh ${name}
done
</pre>

<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span>
Thanks for your note and reminder of the power of sed. It's tricky. I
try to find a balance between having incredibly obfuscated but powerful
invocations of individual commands and having an evolving sequence of
commands in pipes that mimic how most people develop shell scripts.
Sometimes it produces utilities that are less than maximally efficient,
but really, if it's run once a week, do 535.4 milliseconds really
matter?

Thanks to Alolita Sharma for her article on DTV in the July 2008 issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>.
</p><p>
A couple years ago, my wife and I purchased a Hauppauge DVR-950 for use
with our HP laptop. At the time, we wanted to find out what was available
in HD via the local over-the-air stations before committing to the purchase
of an HDTV receiver. We continue to use the 950 occasionally to record and
play back programs.
</p><p>
I have been dual-booting the laptop since the release of Dapper Drake and
have found increasingly little use for Windows with the exception of
running the 950. Thanks to your article, I believe the day is close at hand
when I will be able to eliminate Windows entirely.
</p><p>
I picked up my copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> last Thursday and read your article over the
weekend. On Monday, I started working on the project, and by Monday
afternoon I had MythTV up and running. At first, I had a problem with
accessing the MySQL server, but after running the configuration utilities
and resetting the password, I was able to get into the back end set up. After
making a few educated guesses on the front end setup, I was able to get
MythTV to scan for and find the active broadcast channels, and now have it
working just fine for watching and recording DTV. I still need to refine
the setup just a bit but I don't think that will be difficult at all.
