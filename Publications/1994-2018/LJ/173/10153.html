<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #173, September 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
There's an interesting new project, the <span   class="bold"><b>Kernel
Library Project</b></span>, that
aims to port the Linux OS features, such as the Virtual Filesystem, into
a generic library that would work on any other operating system.
<span   class="bold"><b>Octavian Purdila</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>Stefania Costache</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Lucian
Adrian Grijincu</b></span> have
been working on this, and it could make it a lot easier to run Linux
software anywhere else a user might want to run it. If you find
this interesting, they're looking for volunteers to help out.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Mark Lord</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>Tejun
Heo</b></span> and a variety of others have been keeping <span   class="bold"><b>Serial
ATA</b></span> good and solid. At the moment, they are focusing on fixing, or at
least working around, all stability issues. In some cases, they've been
making very small speed sacrifices in order to make sure that certain
rare problems don't come up at all. At some point, they plan to revamp
some of the code, in order to solve the problems and improve
speed, but that will require more invasive changes. For the moment,
they simply want to make sure that absolutely nothing can go wrong for
users. Kudos to them for keeping up that discipline. As everyone
knows, it's much more fun to throw caution to the wind and just build
lots of new features.
</p><p>
Believe it or not, there still are plenty of people using <span   class="bold"><b>2.4</b></span> in the
world. I'm sure they all wish they could upgrade to 2.6, and the
kernel developers wish that too, but undoubtedly, there are reasons why
their entire corporate infrastructure and all their products would
break if they upgraded to 2.6. And for those users, <span   class="bold"><b>Willy Tarreau</b></span> has
just come out with <span   class="bold"><b>2.4.36.4</b></span>, which includes a small number of key
security fixes. Willy encourages all 2.4 users to upgrade to 2.4.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>David Woodhouse</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Paul Gortmaker</b></span> now are officially in charge of
<span   class="bold"><b>embedded systems</b></span>. The idea of having a maintainer for a general kernel
concept like embedded systems is fairly new, and it creates some
ambiguity for people submitting patches. Do they submit patches to
the maintainer of the specific hardware driver or to the embedded
system maintainers? In practice, it's likely that this won't be a real
concern, and folks will get used to cc-ing whomever they should on
their e-mail messages.
</p><p>
Another potential problem with having an overarching embedded system
maintainer is that such a person might become hypnotized by the idea
of reducing size at any cost, as <span   class="bold"><b>Andi
Kleen</b></span> has pointed out. But, David
has reassured him and everyone else, that size reduction is only one part
of supporting embedded devices, and that the new maintainers plan to
keep a broad outlook, making sure their changes are good for everyone
(or at least not harmful to larger systems or to the kernel sources
themselves).
</p><p>
One of David and Paul's main hopes, and <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew
Morton</b></span>'s as well as
the whole thing was his idea to begin with, is that companies
designing embedded devices will work with David and Paul to create a
better dialogue between that class of companies and the kernel
developers.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Adrian Bunk</b></span> has submitted a patch to
remove the final <span   class="bold"><b>PCI OSS driver</b></span>
from the kernel. The <span   class="bold"><b>Trident 4DWave/SIS 7018 PCI
Audio Core</b></span> has been
on Adrian's hit list for a very long time, but <span   class="bold"><b>Muli
Ben-Yehuda</b></span> always has
resisted. Now that Muli has moved on to other projects, and an
ALSA driver exists that works for the exact same hardware, Adrian's
patience has paid off. OSS finally is fully out of the kernel.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>UBIFS</b></span> seems to be on a relatively fast track into the main kernel
tree. The new Flash filesystem is likely to go into <span   class="bold"><b>Linux-Next</b></span> for
a while, and from there, it should feed relatively automatically into
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span>' tree at the next merge
window. <span   class="bold"><b>Artem Bityutskiy</b></span> set
the wheels in motion with a formal request to <span   class="bold"><b>Stephen
Rothwell</b></span>.
<span   class="bold"><b>Christoph Hellwig</b></span> had a lot of feedback on the code for Artem, and it
came out that NFS would be very difficult for UBIFS to support without
significant code revisions. Artem was surprised to learn about that,
and admitted that yes, probably the initial version of UBIFS in
Linus' tree would not support NFS. This doesn't seem to bother
anyone, and in any case, Artem already is working on some ideas to fix
the problems around NFS support. It does seem as though UBIFS will
soon be part of the official kernel releases.
</p><p>
Recently, there was a fairly significant effort to eliminate the <span   class="bold"><b>BKL</b></span>
(Big Kernel Lock) by replacing it with semaphores. This is an
excellent goal, with all kinds of speed implications for regular
users, but unfortunately, the particular implementation had some speed
problems of its own that led Linus Torvalds eventually to undo the
change entirely. This fairly severe step was prompted partly by the
speed issues of the semaphore solution and partly by the sense that
there must be a better solution out there.
</p><p>
Everyone, including Linus, wants to get rid of the BKL. But, doing this is
very hard. The BKL has various qualities that are difficult to
implement in any of the available alternative locking methods, and
it also has some subtleties that make it hard to determine whether a given
alternate implementation is doing the right thing or not.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Ingo Molnar</b></span>, therefore, has decided to cut through the morass, with a
partial solution that will make the full solution much more
manageable. He plans first of all to extract all the BKL code out of
the core kernel and into an isolated part of the source tree, where it
can one day be replaced entirely, without requiring any subtle changes
to core code. Eventually, he hopes to push each occurrence of the BKL
into the relevant subsystem code, where it could be replaced with
cleaner subsystem locks, which in turn could be eliminated in a more
normal and familiar way.
</p><p>
With Ingo on the job, and Linus taking an active part, a lot of other
big-time hackers have piled on, and there is no doubt that very
significant locking changes are in store for the kernel. What does
this mean for regular users? Probably a snappier, speedier kernel in
the relatively near future.

<h2 class="title">Adios Windows 9x</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Mitch Frazier</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #173, September 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The upcoming release of Cygwin version 1.7 will be dropping support for
Windows 9x (Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows Me).
If you're lucky enough never to have to use Windows, 
Cygwin probably seems like a waste of effort.
But, if you're not so lucky, Cygwin is what keeps you sane.
</p><p>
Cygwin is a Linux-like environment that runs on Windows.
It provides you with a command-line environment with most
of the tools you've come to know and love using Linux.
It even provides a number of Linux d&aelig;mons that can run
as Windows' services, most notably an SSH d&aelig;mon.
</p><p>
There also is a port of the X Window System called Cygwin/X, but it
appears to have been without a maintainer for a few years.
Given that most of the major open-source GUI toolkits now
support Windows, lack of the X Window System may not be a huge stumbling block.
</p><p>
Cygwin was started in 1995 by Steve Chamberlain, an engineer
working for Cygnus (later absorbed by Red Hat).
The earliest mailing list references on the Web are in early 1997,
by which time it appears to have been in a functional state.
</p><p>
If you understand programming on Windows and on Linux, and
you need some mental exercise, try to figure how you'd implement fork() on Windows.
If you want to cheat, check out cygwin/fork.cc in the Cygwin CVS.
</p><p>
We can all imagine a better world, one where our favorite
operating system is ubiquitous, but imagine a world without Cygwin.
If you have to use Windows now and then, that would be a scary world indeed.

<h2 class="title">Eclipse Ganymede</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Mitch Frazier</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #173, September 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The latest version of Eclipse, version 3.4, aka Ganymede, should be
available by the time you read this. If you've never looked at Eclipse
and you work with multiple programming languages or multiple platforms,
take some time to try Eclipse.
</p><p>
Be prepared. Eclipse is a large, complex tool, and you won't grok it if
you invest only 15 minutes. In addition to being large and complex,
Eclipse's roots are at IBM, and it's big in the Java world, so there's a
bit of &ldquo;Blue-Speak&rdquo; and &ldquo;Enterprise-Speak&rdquo; to
deal with at times (and,
of course, XML). 
</p><p>
Most IDEs come with built-in &ldquo;support&rdquo; for lots of programming
languages. Although for a lot of them, support means it colorizes
your code. Eclipse is a bit different. It doesn't come with built-in
support for many languages, or any, depending on the version you download.
Support is provided via Eclipse Plugins. And normally,
&ldquo;support&rdquo; means
more than just colorizing your code. You usually get something that
understands your language. It can show you an outline of the functions
and data in your code; it can help you refactor code; it can show where
something is defined, and it integrates with the language's debugger.
</p><p>
Eclipse is not without its annoyances. Perhaps the most annoying is
that it's <span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> an IDE and 
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a text editor. Of course it edits
text, but it's not a general-purpose text editor. If you want to open
a file that's not part of a project, it's a bit cumbersome. There's no
filesystem browser, and the open dialog doesn't remember the directory
that you used last time. And, if you don't have a plugin for the file
type you open, you don't get any code colorizing. So, you often end up
using Eclipse for your &ldquo;projects&rdquo; but then using another text editor to
look at files that aren't part of your project. 
</p><p>
If you develop only C++ applications for KDE on Linux, or only
XXX applications for YYY on ZZZ, there <span   class="emphasis"><em>might</em></span> be a better IDE
than Eclipse. However, if you use multiple languages and/or multiple
systems, and you want to use only a single IDE, there's no better
IDE than Eclipse. And, even if you use only one language on one system,
Eclipse sets the bar pretty high.

<h2 class="title">New Top-Level Domains on the Way</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Cory Wright</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #173, September 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In late June 2008, ICANN accepted a proposal to relax restrictions on the
top-level domain namespace and, in the process, opened up the possibility for
thousands of new domains. 
</p><p>
Currently, there are only 21 top-level domains,
such as .com, .org or .info, and around 240 active country-code domains,
such as .us, .de and .uk. The proposed plan would allow any organization
or person to apply for a customized top-level domain.
</p><p>
For example, New York City could operate the .nyc domain for addresses, such
as brooklyn.nyc, penn-station.nyc or www.central-park.nyc. &ldquo;It's a
massive increase in the 'real estate' of the Internet&rdquo;, said Dr Paul
Twomey, President and CEO of ICANN. The .com registry is by far the most
crowded at this point, with 71 million registered domains. For comparison,
the second (.de) and third (.net) most popular registries have only 11.2
million and 10.6 million domains, respectively. 
</p><p>
Before you rush to register your new top-level domain, you may want to check
your bank account first. ICANN is expected to charge a minimum of $100,000
for the right to operate your own top-level domain, provided you qualify.
Applicants must prove that they have a &ldquo;business plan and technical
capacity&rdquo;. There is hope that this measure will help keep domain squatters
out of the top-level namespace. 
</p><p>
ICANN also has a process in place to deal with controversial submissions,
as stated on icann.org: &ldquo;Offensive names will be subject to an
objection-based process based on public morality and order. This process
will be conducted by an international arbitration body utilizing criteria
drawing on provisions in a number of international treaties. ICANN will not
be the decision maker on these objections.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Applications for new names will be available in the second quarter of 2009.
</p><p>
Yes, it is true, ICANN HAZ MORE DOMAINS.

<h2 class="title">What They're Using: Christian Einfeldt, Producer, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Digital Tipping Point</em></span></h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Christian Einfeldt</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #173, September 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I have six basic different uses for free, open-source software: 1) my law
office practice; 2) managing and editing video for the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Digital Tipping
Point</em></span> Project; 3) running a 25-seat Edubuntu lab at a public middle school
as a volunteer in San Francisco; 4) placing ACCRC.org Linux computers in
classrooms; 5) giving out ACCRC.org Ubuntu computers to friends, neighbors
and the children who attend that school; and 6) supporting San Francisco's
Tech Connect program by demonstrating Linux boxes at events for nonprofits
and low-income individuals.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10153whatf1.large.jpg"><img src="10153whatf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
The boxes to my left are the thin clients. If you look
just over my right ear, you will see a silvery small computer between two
black monitors. That's the computer on which I captured this
photograph (Gutsy Ubuntu running on the ZaReason media box).
</p></div></div><p>
For my law practice, I use whatever cast-off computer I happen to have
available at the moment from the other computers that I give out to
students, friends or family. I generally can find a P4 computer with
about 512MB of RAM, and I just copy my data from one machine to an
external hard drive and then back onto the new machine. It really varies
depending on the needs of the students, friends and neighbors I am
helping. It's all part of a constant flow of equipment through my office.
For a while, I was using OpenSUSE, but I switched to plain-old,
brown GNOME Ubuntu, simply because most of the sysadmins who help me
prefer plain-old brown.
</p><p>
For the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Digital Tipping Point</em></span> video project, I am using three
machines. They all have the same &ldquo;last name&rdquo;, so to speak, as they are
all members of the &ldquo;Beast&rdquo; family. The least muscular is the Server
Beast (sb), with two single-core AMD processors at about 1GHz each,
running on a Tyan 2460 motherboard and 750GB of storage on two internal
hard drives (built by San Francisco Linux consultant Holden Aust). This machine has an added card with both USB 2.0 and IEEE
1394 ports. It's called the Server Beast because it was formerly a server
owned by a law firm. I use it either for capturing video from my Sony tape
deck, compressing the video, uploading the video to the Internet

Next up in the Beast family is the Render Beast (rb, also built by Holden
Aust). It has a Gibabyte-brand GA-MA69GM-S2H motherboard with an Athlon AMD 64 4200+ chip and 4GB
of RAM. This machine so far has been used mostly for the same basic thing
as the Server Beast, but it's much faster. It also has 1.5TB of internal
HD storage. 
</p><p>
Finally, the newest addition to the family is the TeraByte Beast (tbb,
built by San Francisco Bay Area Linux consultant Daniel Gimpelevich and
Holden Aust),
with a Gibabyte-brand GA-MA790FX-DS5 motherboard with an Athalon AMD 64
4200+ chip and 4GB of RAM. This machine's claim to fame (at least at
Beast family gatherings) is that it has 16 one-terabyte drives, for a
total of 16TB. It's primarily used for storing video,
although it occasionally is pressed into service to do the same
things as its Beast brothers. 
</p><p>
The public middle school's Edubuntu lab has three machines running various
flavors of Ubuntu (built by ZaReason, Inc., a Berkeley-based computer
retailer that sells only Linux-powered computers). There are two video-ready machines, each with an Intel
Core 2 Duo E6300 and 2GB of RAM. Each machine also has a 500GB SATA
drive. These are used
by the students for watching video and listening to music,
as well as practicing photo editing in The GIMP. The teachers have not
yet put together a video-editing course, as they
still are learning how to use video editing under
Cinelerra and Kino. Let's keep our fingers crossed for next year.
</p><p>
ZaReason also built the Edubuntu thin-client server, which is a Pentium D
940 with 2GB of RAM and a 320GB hard drive. That machine supports 23 thin
clients and is used by the students every day except Friday for on-line
research and composing essays and sending them to their teachers via e-mail. The
students also are taught to do presentations, which they deliver in front
of their science and social studies classes. For their essays and
presentations, they use Google Docs, which now has a presentation element
(OpenOffice.org was choking the server). As a nice little bonus, Microsoft
paid for all of the ZaReason boxes&mdash;a result of California's
antitrust settlement

</p><p>
With the help of Andrew Fife and Tom Belote of Untangle.com (a networking
security
company) and Linux
expert Drew Hess, we will be turning the Edubuntu thin-client lab into an
Edubuntu hybrid client network running the programs locally but serving up
the files from the Zareason.com server. The thin clients were choking the
server when audio or video was attempted, so we are shifting some of the
work to the clients next year.

James Burgett, who runs the Alameda County Computer Resource Center
(ACCRC.org) has been a really generous donor of equipment for the public
middle school I am supporting with free, open-source software. James gave
the school an initial donation of 30 HP P4 Ubuntu machines with 256MB of
RAM. Some of those boxes were given to students, and some were used in
the Edubuntu lab. Other boxes were placed in classrooms, where the
students use the machines for the same purposes as in the lab.
</p><p>
James Burgett (also of Untangle.com) and Andrew Fife 
organized a massive
installfest (<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/273770" target="_self">lwn.net/Articles/273770</a>) at the school and four
other locations in the San Francisco Bay Area
(<a href="http://untangle.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=393&amp;Itemid=139" target="_self">untangle.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=393&amp;Itemid=139</a>) on March 1, 2008. That
installfest allowed me to give neighbors and friends some of the
machines I had scrounged for the school, by replacing
those machines with newer machines from the ACCRC.org - Untangle
installfest. Also, many of the new machines were given out to students, many of whom have no computers
at home. ACCRC.org and Untangle.com are planning
another massive installfest
(<a href="http://untangle.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=351&amp;Itemid=139" target="_self">untangle.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=351&amp;Itemid=139</a>) for LinuxWorld Expo in August 2008 in San
Francisco.
</p><p>
Finally, the St. Anthony Foundation of San Francisco has loaned me seven Dell
GX 150 machines with 256MB of RAM, which I use to support Kari Gray in
her work with the City and County of San Francisco's Tech Connect Project
to introduce low-income people to technology. A video of an
event at St. Anthony's Foundation in San Francisco's skid row is available

<h2 class="title">Linux on the Desktop? Who Cares?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #173, September 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Every so often, you read on Slashdot, Digg or some other techie news site
that Linux is finally ready for the desktop. It's finally to the point that
any end user could sit down at a computer and happily compute away. The
applications are sufficiently sanitized and Windows-like that even the
average Joe can use them. I think, however, that it's fair to say most of
our previous conceptions of &ldquo;ready for the desktop&rdquo; are moot points.
</p><p>
The only folks who are still up in arms over whether Linux 
ever will be ready are the same folks who have been talking about it for years.
New users really don't care. I don't say that arbitrarily; I say that
because I work in a school, and I see the current generation of computer
users. They don't care if they use a Mac, a PC or a Linux machine. Most
don't even notice the difference. In an unofficial, random sampling of
college and high-school students, here's what they need from a computer:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Firefox (really, by name&mdash;cool, eh?).
</p></li><li><p>
A way to play music (iTunes often is mentioned, but not insisted upon).
</p></li><li><p>
Microsoft Office.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
And, that's it. The last point bummed me out a bit, so I asked more probing
questions. It turns out that Microsoft Office has become the common name for
an office suite&mdash;much like Kleenex became the name for facial tissue. For
almost everyone I asked, OpenOffice.org or even Google Docs (in a pinch) is the
same thing. In fact, some weren't really sure why I'd ask such a thing,
because &ldquo;aren't they all the same?&rdquo;
</p><p>
Some people want a specific type of computer for tasks like
video production or gaming, but they aren't the overwhelming majority
anymore. Everyone wants or needs a computer now, and the general population
doesn't seem to care much about what operating system it's running.
</p><p>
My suspicion is that Web 2.0 and mobile (smartphone) technology is doing
more to help Linux than anything else in history. It's not because Linux is
better at such things; it's because the world is moving to the Web.
The vehicle to get there is becoming less and less important.
</p><p>
The good news is that now Linux finally can take over the world, and most
people won't even notice!
