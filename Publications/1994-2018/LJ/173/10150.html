How Firefox became our very favorite browser.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1108580.0x1200250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
It took many years for Firefox to be an overnight success. Who would
have thought back in March 1998, when the struggling Netscape released
the source code for its Communicator Suite, that Firefox would be
the favorite browser on the Linux platform and a formidable insurgent
challenger to Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE) on Windows.
</p><p>
Gradually over the past ten years, Netscape morphed into the Mozilla
browser, which in turn gave rise to Firefox. Today, Firefox owns a
market share of around 20% worldwide (and much higher in certain places).
How was Firefox able to accomplish this rise from the ashes of
Netscape and go from underdog to hero?
</p><p>
The story of Firefox also is a story of the coming of age of open source,
of opportunities presented by Microsoft failing its users of IE, of Internet
users hungering for something new and of cutting-edge innovation that
blew our socks off.

Netscape: Firefox's Proprietary Great Uncle</h2></div></div><p>
Certainly you remember the browser wars of the mid- to late-1990s&mdash;the
ones that Netscape lost handily. Although we were fortunate that Netscape
cared enough to maintain a Linux version, we used the Communicator out
of necessity, not passion.
</p><p>
Little did we know at the time, but the seeds of change (and the
beginnings of the Firefox browser) would be planted on January 23,
1998, when Netscape announced the release of source code for Netscape
Navigator 5.0. Recall that back in 1998, the open-source model still
was viewed with widespread skepticism. At that time, Eric S. Raymond had
written the on-line version of <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cathedral and the
Bazaar</em></span>, which made
open source tangible to more people. Raymond, who guided Netscape through
its open-source strategy, noted that his contacts at the company had such
a huge sense of relief, or even gratitude, because market conditions had
become so bad, they could justify doing what they wanted to do anyway.
</p><p>
Netscape's Vice President of Products, Marc Andreessen, said his
company open-sourced Netscape because, &ldquo;we're at an inflection point,
a trigger point, when there's an alignment with the energy of growth.
Linux is hot. The technologists have adopted it, and it's growing fast
all through the Open Source community. This gives us the confidence that we
couldn't screw it up if we tried.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Raymond also called Netscape's decision, &ldquo;the long-awaited breakout of free
software into the commercial world&rdquo;. Little did he know the prescience
of his words at the time.
</p><p>
A few months later, in March 1998, mozilla.org was founded, the source
code for Netscape Communicator 4.0 was released and the community went
to work.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1108580.0x1201a08"></a>
The Making of Mozilla: 1998&ndash;2002</h2></div></div><p>
It took some time for Mozilla to come of age post-Netscape. Although
Netscape Communicator's source code was released in early 1998, the
Mozilla 1.0 suite, or applications framework as it is technically called,
was not finished until June 5, 2002. Despite Mozilla's Netscape-like
look and feel during this period, much was changing under the hood.
In November 2000, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> writer Mike Angelo
commented that &ldquo;if
you have any notions that Mozilla, the browser suite, is an upgrade
from Netscape Communicator 4.x, please lose them. Picture Mozilla as a
browser suite that is new from the ground up, but just looks and feels
lots like the Netscape 4.x browser suite, thanks to its skin&rdquo;.
</p><p>
In spite of the overhaul, Mozilla retained Netscape's
&ldquo;all-in-one&rdquo; suite
orientation, which was later to be shed by the self-standing Firefox.
Mozilla consisted of the applications Mozilla Navigator, Mozilla Composer,
Mozilla E-Mail, Mozilla News and ChatZilla.
</p><p>
During this period, in March 1999, Netscape went off to become part
of America Online. Nevertheless, the two organizations retained close
ties&mdash;for instance, many of Mozilla's developers were inside Netscape/AOL, and
Netscape/AOL continued to assist Mozilla financially. Furthermore, while
Netscape/AOL utilized the Mozilla code as a base for its own Netscape 6,
the company added its own proprietary features, such as AIM.
</p><p>
Development-wise, these six interim years were productive. Most
important, the Mozilla development team built the Gecko browser layout
engine from scratch and ensured full W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)
standards compliance. In addition, changing skins on the fly, security
features and the plugin model were expanded and improved significantly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1108580.0x11f85b0"></a>
Mozilla 1.0: Worth the Wait </h2></div></div><p>
After four long years of development, Mozilla 1.0, mostly free of
its Netscape Communicator past, was at last released on June 4, 2002.
CNET.com's Rex Baldazo raved that &ldquo;The four-and-a-half-year wait is
over&mdash;Mozilla 1.0 has gone gold, and from what we've seen, it's been
worth the delay.&rdquo; Immediately, users were impressed with Mozilla's
speed, stability and features, such as tabbed browsing, pop-up blocking and
custom skins.
</p><p>
Mozilla's features caught the surfing public's attention and 
re-ignited the browser wars of yore. Several different Web analytics
firms reported that Microsoft's Internet Explorer dropped from a 97%
market share in 2002 to 93% in late 2004. During the same period, Mozilla
went from a 2% market share with Netscape to more than 5% with all of its open-source
browser offerings.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1108580.0x11f8768"></a>
Firefox Grows in the Shadow of the Mozilla Suite</h2></div></div><p>
While the Mozilla browser was out in the world making Web surfers
everywhere gleeful, the development team at mozilla.org, led by Chief
Technology Officer Brendan Eich, already was laying the foundation for
a much better browser. On September 23, 2002, the Mozilla team released
Phoenix 0.1 (Pescadero), the first official version of a standalone
browser that would later be named Firebird and, eventually, Firefox.
Phoenix was a redesign of Mozilla's browser component but written using
the XUL user interface language and designed to be cross-platform.
Phoenix's developers stated that &ldquo;Phoenix is not your father's Mozilla
browser. It's a lean and fast browser that doesn't skimp on
features&rdquo;,
loading pages in half the time as Mozilla 1.1. Furthermore, they added, &ldquo;Not
only does Phoenix aim to match the feature set of Mozilla&mdash;subtracting
features deemed geeky and better offered as add-ons&mdash;but it extends it.
We also believe Mozilla, in general, is going in the wrong direction
in terms of bloat and UI, and see no reason for our releases to carry
those connotations.&rdquo;
</p><p>
On April 3, 2003, Mozilla announced its intent to develop what would become
Firefox (code-named Firebird at the time) as a standalone application
rather than as part of an integrated suite.
</p><p>
Mozilla's Eich summarized the new browser's philosophy in its
development road map as follows:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
[Firefox] is simply smaller, faster,
and better&mdash;especially better not because it has every conflicting
feature wanted by each segment of the Mozilla community, but because
it has a strong &ldquo;add-on&rdquo; extension mechanism....Attempting to
&ldquo;hard-wire&rdquo;
all these features to the integrated application suite is not legitimate;
it's neither technically nor socially scalable.
</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1108580.0x11f8b30"></a>
Firefox 1.0 Arrives</h2></div></div><p>
Six years, seven months and nine days after the birth of mozilla.org,
Firefox 1.0 was born on November 9, 2004. Looking back to the earliest
days of Firefox 1.0 with three and a half years of perspective and
comfortable browsing, it's easy to forget how exciting the post-release
vibe was. Firefox saw more than 100,000 downloads in the first few hours and
nearly 10 million per month shortly after the release. Toward the end
of its run, Firefox 1.0 reached 100 million downloads in October 2005.
This success translated into a market share of around 5%. By early
December 2004, according to OnStat.com, Internet Explorer's market share
dropped yet again to below 90%.
</p><p>
There was a palpable hunger for an alternative. As part of the Spread
Firefox campaign, 10,000 Firefox supporters coughed up some of their
hard-earned money to show support for their browser by contributing
to fund a full-spread advertisement in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>New York
Times</em></span>. Spread Firefox
is the nexus of global community volunteerism to promote Firefox via
guerrilla marketing activities.
</p><p>
The left page of the masterful <span   class="emphasis"><em>New York Times</em></span> ad
features the names of all
10,000 contributors over a shadowed Firefox logo. The ad asks
the reader, &ldquo;Are you fed up with your Web browser? You're not alone.
We want you to know there is an alternative.&rdquo; On the right page,
it featured, &ldquo;Introducing Mozilla Firefox 1.0&rdquo; in bold type, followed by
quotes from satisfied users and the advantages of Firefox, such as speed
and browsing free of pop-ups and spyware. &ldquo;Find out what 10 million
users from around the world already know: there is an alternative.&rdquo;
Unfortunately, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Times</em></span> ad is not printable in this space due to size
constraints, although you can see it at the Spread Firefox Web site.
</p><p>
There also was hunger for better security. On the Windows side, it
seemed that IE was once invincible. However, IE's
security problems pushed millions of users and countless organizations
out to the far edge of the plank; Firefox was the nudge that made them
jump ship in droves.
</p><p>
For most people, however, the reason to move to Firefox was its features.
They ate up the tabbed browsing, better standards support, integrated
search, a user-friendly plugin management system, easy installation
and removal procedures and, of course, better security. The latter was
possible, because Firefox lacks the deep hooks into the operating system
as is the situation with IE, which therefore suffers greater impact
from flaws.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1108580.0x11f9000"></a>
Firefox 1.5</h2></div></div><p>
During 2005, Firefox gained 10% of global market share from its rivals,
a feat that the proprietary Netscape could not muster after falling
behind Internet Explorer. The success train continued to roll down the
tracks, and Mozilla released Firefox 1.5 on November 29, 2005.
</p><p>
In Firefox 1.5, the Mozilla development team added new features, such
as even speedier page loading, drag-and-drop search, integrated RSS
reader, tab re-ordering, better pop-up blocking, binary patching for
upgrades, clearing of personal data with a single button and partial
SVG 1.1 support&mdash;not to mention all the new extensions that
continue to accumulate, which leave practically no limit to what you
can do with Firefox.
</p><p>
Despite the increased complexity of version 1.5, the Firefox development
team continued to prove itself more worthy than its rivals, not only attending to serious flaws but also avoiding them in
the first place.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1108580.0x11f91b8"></a>
Firefox 2.0</h2></div></div><p>
We need another metaphor for inertia, because Firefox 2.0 has it too.
As we sit on the verge of version 3.0, we can see that Firefox 2.0
has carved out another 8% of market share to reach 18%, according to
Net Applications. This translates into approximately 170 million users
worldwide.
</p><p>
For features, the 2.0 release added Google's anti-phishing software, Live
Titles for bookmarks, spell-checking, improved UI and improved support
for SVG and JavaScript 1.7.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1108580.0x11f9318"></a>
Firefox 3.0</h2></div></div><p>
As I finish this article, I longingly look ahead to the release date for
Firefox 3.0, which looms just a few tantalizing days out at the time of
this writing.
The day is also Download Day, an initiative by Spread Firefox to set
the Guinness World Record for Most Software Downloaded in 24 Hours.
As of mid-June, the number stands at 1.1 million and growing. Clearly,
now that open source has taken hold, it is possible to assert that one
should never underestimate the effectiveness of disciplined bands of
inspired volunteers to change the world of computing.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10150f1.large.jpg"><img src="10150f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Firefox says that Version 3.0 has more than 15,000 updates. 
Will it keep Firefox's momentum going?
</p></div></div><p>
Mozilla has raised expectations for Firefox 3.0, saying that it
will run double the speed of its predecessor and use much less
memory. Furthermore, the browser will be much smarter, as you can simply
begin typing into the location bar, or &ldquo;aweome bar&rdquo;, to find what you
are looking for, and Firefox offers a list of options it thinks are most
relevant to you. 
</p><p>
Version 3.0 also implements the updated Gecko 1.9 layout engine, which
allows it to pass the Acid2 test, a standards-compliance test for
Web-page rendering.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1108580.0x11f9738"></a>
From Underdog to Hero</h2></div></div><p>
Firefox's trajectory&mdash;from proprietary Netscape to Mozilla to
Phoenix/Firebird and finally Firefox&mdash;is an incredible story of triumph. What began as the outdated, proprietary Netscape
browser, with shrinking market share from a struggling company, was set
free with open source to transform itself into a technological and
organizational powerhouse. Firefox now ranks with Linux and Apache as
one of the world's premier open-source applications. Although it has
taken a decade, Firefox has valiantly clawed back to nearly 20% market
share worldwide, with 29% in Europe and more than 40% in countries like Finland
and Poland. This is quite an accomplishment, given that Firefox's main
competitors, IE and Safari, have huge pre-installation advantages.
</p><p>
Firefox came of age with open source and, as Technetra's Alolita Sharma observed,
&ldquo;has helped make open source mainstream&rdquo; and that &ldquo;its success as a
constantly evolving open-source product has validated the open-source
development model&rdquo;. Hats off to the pioneers like Eric S. Raymond
who helped Netscape see the light in 1998 and get started on the
right foot, as well as the hundreds of developers and activists who
contributed to Firefox technically and promotionally. Without the army
of Spread Firefox volunteers, who never would be so enthusiastic about
a proprietary product, Firefox's success would be much less viral.
</p><p>
Many thanks also go to Microsoft for so many things&mdash;its horrible
attention to security, lack of innovation and IE's overly tight integration
with Windows&mdash;all of which made users so fed up and thirsty for an
alternative. It helped tip so many millions to Firefox.
</p><p>
The past decade has been quite a run for our friend Firefox. It has
matured admirably over time, and version 3.0 continues the positive,
upward trend. As mentioned, however, competitors are in the wings
who would love to experience similar success and grab hold of some
of Google's millions that Firefox currently receives. Already there
are signs that Safari is eating into some of Firefox's market share in
North America. Regardless, if our fledgling hero can ride its current
wave of technical innovation and popular support, 
we should see Firefox residing on ever more desktops of satisfied
computer users.
