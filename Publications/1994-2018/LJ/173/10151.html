Run graphical applications from afar, securely.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1505580.0x15fd460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
There are many different ways to control a Linux system over a network,
and many reasons you might want to do so. When covering remote control
in past columns, I've tended to focus on server-oriented usage scenarios
and tools, which is to say, on administering servers via text-based
applications, such as OpenSSH. But, what about GUI-based applications and
remote desktops?
</p><p>
Remote desktop sessions can be very useful for technical support,
surveillance and remote control of desktop applications. But, it isn't
always necessary to access an entire desktop; you may
need to run only one or two specific graphical applications.
</p><p>
In this month's column, I describe how to use VNC (Virtual Network
Computing) for remote desktop sessions and OpenSSH with X forwarding
for remote access to specific applications. Our focus here, of course,
is on using these tools securely, and I include a healthy dose of
opinion as to the relative merits of each.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1505580.0x15fd6c8"></a>
Remote Desktops vs. Remote Applications</h2></div></div><p>
So, which approach should you use, remote desktops or remote
applications? If you've come to Linux from the Microsoft world, you
may be tempted to assume that because Terminal Services in Windows is so
useful, you <span   class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> to have some sort of remote desktop access in
Linux too. But, that may not be the case.
</p><p>
Linux and most other UNIX-based operating systems use the X Window System
as the basis for their various graphical environments. And, the X Window
System was designed to be run over networks. In fact, it treats your
local system as a self-contained network over which different parts of
the X Window System communicate.
</p><p>
Accordingly, it's not only possible but <span   class="emphasis"><em>easy</em></span> to run individual
X Window System applications over TCP/IP networks&mdash;that is, to display the
output (window) of a remotely executed graphical application on your
local system. Because the X Window System's use of networks isn't terribly secure
(the X Window System has no native support whatsoever for any kind of encryption),
nowadays we usually tunnel X Window System application windows over the Secure
Shell (SSH), especially OpenSSH.
</p><p>
The advantage of tunneling individual application windows is
that it's faster and generally more secure than running the entire
desktop remotely. The disadvantages are that OpenSSH has a history of
security vulnerabilities, and for many Linux newcomers, forwarding
graphical applications via commands entered in a shell session is
counterintuitive. And besides, as I mentioned earlier, remote desktop
control (or even just viewing) can be very useful for technical support
and for security surveillance.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1505580.0x15fd9e0"></a>
Using OpenSSH with X Window System Forwarding</h2></div></div><p>
Having said all that, tunneling X Window System applications over OpenSSH
may be a lot easier than you imagine. All you need is a client system
running an X server (for example, a Linux desktop system or a Windows
system running the Cygwin X server) and a destination system running
the OpenSSH d&aelig;mon (sshd).
</p><p>
Note that I didn't say &ldquo;a destination system running sshd
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> an X
server&rdquo;. This is because X servers, oddly enough, don't actually run or
control X Window System applications; they merely display their output. Therefore,
if you're running an X Window System application on a remote system, you need
to run an X server on your local system, not on the remote system. The
application will execute on the remote system and send its output to
your local X server's display.
</p><p>
Suppose you've got two systems, mylaptop and remotebox, and you
want to monitor system resources on remotebox with the GNOME System
Monitor. Suppose further you're running the X Window System on mylaptop and sshd
on remotebox.
</p><p>
First, from a terminal window or xterm on mylaptop, you'd open an SSH
session like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mick@mylaptop:~$ ssh -X admin-slave@remotebox
admin-slave@remotebox's password: **********
Last login: Wed Jun 11 21:50:19 2008 from dtcla00b674986d
admin-slave@remotebox:~$
</pre>
</p><p>
Note the -X flag in my ssh command. This enables X Window System forwarding
for the SSH session. In order for that to work, sshd on the remote
system must be configured with X11Forwarding set to yes in its
/etc/ssh/sshd.conf file. On many distributions, yes is the default
setting, but check yours to be sure.
</p><p>
Next, to run the GNOME System Monitor on remotebox, such that its output
(window) is displayed on mylaptop, simply execute it from within the
same SSH session:

<pre     class="programlisting">

admin-slave@remotebox:~$ gnome-system-monitor &amp;

</pre>
</p><p>
The trailing ampersand (&amp;) causes this command to run in the background,
so you can initiate other commands from the same shell session. Without
this, the cursor won't reappear in your shell window until you kill the
command you just started.
</p><p>
At this point, the GNOME System Monitor window should appear on mylaptop's
screen, displaying system performance information for remotebox. And,
that really is all there is to it.
</p><p>
This technique works for practically any X Window System application installed
on the remote system. The only catch is that you need to know the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span> of anything you want to run in this way&mdash;that is, the actual
name of the executable file.
</p><p>
If you're accustomed to starting your X Window System applications from a
menu on your desktop, you may not know the names of their corresponding
executables. One quick way to find out is to open your desktop manager's
menu editor, and then view the properties screen for the application
in question.
</p><p>
For example, on a GNOME desktop, you would right-click on the
Applications menu button, select Edit Menus, scroll down to
System/Administration, right-click on System Monitor and select
Properties. This pops up a window whose Command field shows
the name gnome-system-monitor.
</p><p>
Figure 1 shows the Launcher Properties, <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> for the GNOME System
Monitor, but instead for the GNOME File Browser, which is a better example,
because its launcher entry includes some command-line options. Obviously,
all such options also can be used when starting X applications over SSH.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10151f1.large.jpg"><img src="10151f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Launcher Properties for the GNOME File Browser (Nautilus)
</p></div></div><p>
If this sounds like too much trouble, or if you're worried about accidentally
messing up your desktop menus, you simply can run the application in
question, issue the command <tt  >ps auxw</tt> in a terminal window, and find
the entry that corresponds to your application. The last field in each
row of the output from ps is the executable's name plus the command-line
options with which it was invoked.
</p><p>
Once you've finished running your remote X Window System application, you can
close it the usual way (selecting Exit from its File menu, clicking
the x button in the upper right-hand corner of its window and so
forth). Don't forget to close your SSH session too, by issuing the command
<tt  >exit</tt> in the terminal window where you're running SSH.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1505580.0x15fe3d8"></a>
Virtual Network Computing (VNC)</h2></div></div><p>
Now that I've shown you the <span   class="emphasis"><em>preferred</em></span> way to run remote X Window System
applications, let's discuss how to control an entire remote desktop. In
the Linux/UNIX world, the most popular tool for this is Virtual Network
Computing, or VNC.
</p><p>
Originally a project of the Olivetti Research Laboratory (which was
subsequently acquired by Oracle and then AT&amp;T before being shut down),
VNC uses a protocol called Remote Frame Buffer (RFB). The original
creators of VNC now maintain the application suite RealVNC, which
is available in free and commercial versions, but TightVNC, UltraVNC
and GNOME's vino VNC server and vinagre VNC client also are popular.
</p><p>
VNC's strengths are its simplicity, ubiquity and portability&mdash;it runs
on many different operating systems. Because it runs over a single TCP port
(usually TCP 5900), it's also firewall-friendly and easy to tunnel.
</p><p>
Its security, however, is somewhat problematic. VNC authentication uses a
DES-based transaction that, if eavesdropped-on, is vulnerable to optimized
brute-force (password-guessing) attacks. This vulnerability is exacerbated
by the fact that many versions of VNC support only eight-character passwords.
</p><p>
Furthermore, VNC session data usually is transmitted unencrypted. Only a
couple flavors of VNC support TLS encryption of RFB streams, and it
isn't clear how securely TLS has been implemented even in those. Thus,
an attacker using a trivially hacked VNC client may be able to reconstruct
and view eavesdropped VNC streams.
</p><p>
Luckily, as it operates over a single TCP port, VNC is easy to
tunnel through SSH, through Virtual Private Network (VPN) sessions
and through TLS/SSL wrappers, such as stunnel. Let's look at a simple
VNC-over-SSH example.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1505580.0x15fe748"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
But Don't Real Sysadmins Stick to Terminal
Sessions?</b></p><p>
If you've read my book or my past columns, you've endured my repeated
exhortations to keep the X Window System off of Internet-facing servers,
or any other system on which it isn't needed, due to X's complexity
and history of security vulnerabilities. So, why am I devoting an entire
column to graphical remote system administration?
</p><p>
Don't worry. I haven't gone soft-hearted (though possibly slightly
soft-headed); I stand by that advice. But, there are plenty of contexts
in which you may need to administer or view things remotely besides
hardened servers in Internet-facing DMZ networks.
</p><p>
And, not all people who need to run remote applications in those
non-Internet-DMZ scenarios are advanced Linux users. Should they be
forbidden from doing what they need to do until they've mastered using
the vi editor and writing bash scripts? Especially given that it <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span>
possible to mitigate some of the risks associated with the X Window System and VNC?
</p><p>
Of course they shouldn't! Although I do encourage all Linux newcomers
to embrace the command line. The day may come when Linux is a truly
graphically oriented operating system like Mac OS, but for now, pretty
much the entire OS is driven by configuration files in /etc (and in users'
home directories), and that's unlikely to change soon.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1505580.0x15feab8"></a>
Tunneling VNC over SSH</h2></div></div><p>
To tunnel VNC over SSH, your remote system must be running an SSH d&aelig;mon
(sshd) and a VNC server application. Your local system must have an
SSH client (ssh) and a VNC client application.
</p><p>
Our example remote system, remotebox, already is running sshd. Suppose
it also has vino, which is also known as the GNOME Remote Desktop
Preferences applet (on Ubuntu systems, it's located in the System menu's
Preferences section). First, presumably from remotebox's local console,
you need to open that applet and enable remote desktop sharing. Figure
2 shows vino's General settings.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10151f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. General Settings in GNOME Remote Desktop Preferences (vino)
</p></div></div><p>
If you want to view only this system's remote desktop without controlling
it, uncheck Allow other users to control your desktop. If you don't want
to have to confirm remote connections explicitly (for example, because you
want to connect to this system when it's unattended), you can uncheck the
Ask you for confirmation box. Any time you leave yourself logged in
to an unattended system, be sure to use a password-protected screensaver!
</p><p>
vino is limited in this way. Because vino is loaded only after you log in,
you can use it only to connect to a fully logged-in GNOME session in
progress&mdash;not, for example, to a gdm (GNOME login) prompt. Unlike vino,
other versions of VNC can be invoked as needed from xinetd or inetd. That
technique is out of the scope of this article, but see Resources 
for a link to a how-to for doing so in Ubuntu, or simply
Google the string &ldquo;vnc xinetd&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Continuing with our vino example, don't close that Remote Desktop
Preferences applet yet. Be sure to check the Require the user to enter
this password box and to select a difficult-to-guess password. Remember,
vino runs in an <span   class="emphasis"><em>already-logged-in</em></span> desktop session, so unless you
set a password here, you'll run the risk of allowing <span   class="emphasis"><em>completely
unauthenticated</em></span> sessions (depending on whether a password-protected
screensaver is running).
</p><p>
If your remote system will be run logged in but unattended, you
probably will want to uncheck Ask you for confirmation. Again, don't forget
that locked screensaver.
</p><p>
We're not done setting up vino on remotebox yet. Figure 3 shows
the Advanced Settings tab.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10151f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Advanced Settings in GNOME Remote Desktop Preferences (vino)
</p></div></div><p>
Several advanced settings are particularly noteworthy. First, you should
check Only allow local connections, after which remote connections
still <span   class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> be possible, but only via a port-forwarder like SSH
or stunnel. Second, you may want to set a custom TCP port for vino to
listen on via the Use an alternative port option. In this example, I've
chosen 20226. This is an instance of useful security-through-obscurity;
if our other (more meaningful) security controls fail, at least we won't
be running VNC on the obvious default port.
</p><p>
Also, you should check the box next to Lock screen on disconnect,
but you probably should <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> check Require encryption,
as SSH will provide our session encryption, and adding redundant
(and not-necessarily-known-good) encryption will only increase vino's
already-significant latency. If you think there's only a moderate level
of risk of eavesdropping in the environment in which you want to use
vino&mdash;for example, on a small, private, local-area network inaccessible
from the Internet&mdash;vino's TLS implementation may be good enough for you.
In that case, you may opt to check the Require encryption box and skip
the SSH tunneling.
</p><p>
(If any of you know more about TLS in vino than I was able to divine
from the Internet, please write in. During my research for this article,
I found no documentation or on-line discussions of vino's TLS design
details whatsoever&mdash;beyond people commenting that the soundness of TLS
in vino is unknown.)
</p><p>
This month, I seem to be offering you more &ldquo;opt-out&rdquo; opportunities
in my examples than usual. Perhaps I'm becoming less dogmatic with
age. Regardless, let's assume you've followed my advice to forego
vino's encryption in favor of SSH.
</p><p>
At this point, you're done with the server-side settings. You won't have
to change those again. If you restart your GNOME session on remotebox,
vino will restart as well, with the options you just set. The following
steps, however, are necessary each time you want to initiate a
VNC/SSH session.
</p><p>
On mylaptop (the system from which you want to connect to remotebox),
open a terminal window, and type this command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
mick@mylaptop:~$ ssh -L 20226:remotebox:20226 admin-slave@remotebox
</pre>
</p><p>
OpenSSH's -L option sets up a local port-forwarder. In this example,
connections to mylaptop's TCP port 20226 will be forwarded to the same
port on remotebox. The syntax for this option is &ldquo;-L [localport]:[remote
IP or hostname]:[remoteport]&rdquo;. You can use any available local TCP port
you like (higher than 1024, unless you're running SSH as root), but the
remote port must correspond to the alternative port you set vino to listen
on (20226 in our example), or if you didn't set an alternative port,
it should be VNC's default of 5900.
</p><p>
That's it for the SSH session. You'll be prompted for a password
and then given a bash prompt on remotebox. But, you won't need it
except to enter <tt  >exit</tt> when your VNC session is finished. It's time to
fire up your VNC client.
</p><p>
vino's companion client, vinagre (also known as the GNOME Remote Desktop
Viewer) is good enough for our purposes here. On Ubuntu systems, it's
located in the Applications menu in the Internet section. In Figure
4, I've opened the Remote Desktop Viewer and clicked the Connect
button. As you can see, rather than remotebox, I've entered localhost as the
hostname. I've also entered port number 20226.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10151f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Using vinagre to Connect to an SSH-Forwarded Local Port
</p></div></div><p>
When I click the Connect button, vinagre connects to mylaptop's
local TCP port 20226, which actually is being listened on by my local SSH
process. SSH forwards this connection attempt through its encrypted
connection to TCP 20226 on remotebox, which is being listened on by
remotebox's vino process.
</p><p>
At this point, I'm prompted for remotebox's vino password (shown in Figure 2). On successful authentication, I'll have full access to my active
desktop session on remotebox.
</p><p>
To end the session, I close the Remote Desktop Viewer's session,
and then enter <tt  >exit</tt> in my SSH session to remotebox&mdash;that's all
there is to it.
</p><p>
This technique is easy to adapt to other versions of VNC servers
and clients, and probably also to other versions of SSH&mdash;there
are commercial alternatives to OpenSSH, including Windows versions. I
mentioned that VNC client applications are available for a wide variety
of platforms; on any such platform, you can use this technique, so long
as you also have an SSH client that supports port forwarding.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Thus ends my crash course on how to control graphical applications over
networks. I hope my examples of both techniques, SSH with X forwarding
and VNC over SSH, help you get started with whatever particular
distribution and software packages you prefer. Be safe!
