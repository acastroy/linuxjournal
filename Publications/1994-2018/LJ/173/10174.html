Programmers, network administrators, tech-support personnel and IT folks
in general are rarely in the limelight. It's no secret, however, that the
people behind the scenes are truly the ones running the world. As part of
the geeky infrastructure that keeps the planet going, we all know the power
of the underdog. Heck, we &ldquo;save the day&rdquo; on a regular basis, and most
people never are the wiser. Can you imagine a world without any IT staff?
Oh sure, that might seem a bit arrogant, but really, with little fanfare,
we keep the end users happy. And, our operating system of choice? Linux, of
course.
</p><p>
With its relatively small desktop market share, Linux often is considered
an underdog. Here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, we prefer to think of it more along
the lines of &ldquo;Undiscovered Superhero&rdquo;, but however you look at it, Linux
is the operating system that is easy to love. If you take off the wide-angle lens, however, and look strictly at software in the Open Source
community, we have underdogs of our own. This month, we decided it would
be nice to give the spotlight to those diamonds in the rough.
</p><p>
If you're reading this article on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Web site, chances are
you're using the Firefox browser to do so. Firefox certainly isn't an
underdog anymore, but James Gray gives us a play-by-play history of its
evolution from the very beginning. Hopefully, the Firefox success story
will be one we see repeated over and over. Will Xara Xtreme be the
next application to offer some serious competition in its field? Well,
switching to an open-source license for its core program certainly is a
step in the right direction. Dan Sawyer shows us this graphics and
illustration design program that is now available. If you're tired of
running Adobe Illustrator via Wine, you'll love the new Linux native Xara
Xtreme.
</p><p>
If indeed you are reading this on-line, you've probably correctly assumed
that LinuxJournal.com is hosted with Apache. That should come as no
surprise, but what might come as a bit of a shock is that Will Reese tells
us Nginx might be a better alternative. Thankfully, it's still very much
an open-source project, so we're at least willing to listen. Cory Wright
tells us about a wonderful alternative to BIND as well. If security and
configuration concerns about BIND have given you cause to worry, djbdns
just might be the ticket. Cory walks us through the why, how and where of
configuring this little-known DNS server.
</p><p>
What discussion regarding underdogs would be complete without talking about
the command line? Love it or hate it, Linux is built around the terminal.
Kyle Rankin tells us how to get the most out of our terminal by splitting
it up. If you're not sure what you would put in a split-window xterm, a
good place to start is with e-mail. Victor Gregorio tells us all about
Mutt, a command-line e-mail client that has more features than many of its
GUI counterparts.
</p><p>
Here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, however, we're all about choice. If the command
line makes you nervous, there are plenty of GUI alternatives. Heck, we
even have choices when it comes to the version of Linux distribution you
want to run. Many of us use the &ldquo;big dogs&rdquo; of the Linux world when it
comes to distros, but what about Gentoo? It's certainly not for the faint of
heart, but Mike Diehl thinks it might be worth the time it takes to
install.  Perhaps after reading his article, you'll agree.
</p><p>
If you're just looking to cheer for the underdog or hoping to
discover the Next Big Thing, this issue should educate, enlighten and
entertain. As always, we have our full lineup of regular columns, helpful
tech tips, and geek-friendly product reviews. So whether you stay up
reading all night or start a stockpile of reading material for the analog
television blackout in February (Doc Searls talks about that this month as
well), this issue is bound to be a keeper.
