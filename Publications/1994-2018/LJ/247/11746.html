vtop is a graphical activity monitor for the command line. In this article, I take you
through how I wrote the app, how it works underneath and invite you to
help extend it.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x227b580.0x2373250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
System monitoring tools have been with us since the early days of
computing, but on the terminal, many people still use the top command. Now, let me 
introduce you to my open-source activity monitor called vtop.
It uses Unicode Braille characters for richer visualization on the command
line. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11746f1.large.jpg"><img src="11746f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Background</h2></div></div><p>
For many, the top command has been a key way to monitor rogue processes
on *nix systems. William LeFebvre wrote the original top command more than
30 years ago on a Vax running BSD UNIX. He was inspired by the Vax VMS
operating system that listed the most CPU-hungry processes along with an
ASCII bar chart. The bar chart didn't make it across into his version;
the author went instead for a text-based approach to displaying data
that has stuck with us.
</p><p>
While the GUI-world enjoys increasingly feature-rich tools, terminal
applications sadly have lagged behind. Graphical representations in
system monitoring tools are nothing new. KSysguard and GNOME's System
Monitor sport fancy graphs and charts, but this isn't much use to us on
the command line.
</p><p>
Although there's absolutely nothing wrong with top's text-based approach,
it's not what I needed when I set out to write vtop. The original vtop
was a quick hack, mostly written in a day, and like all the best open-source
software, it scratched an itch. I needed to see CPU spikes to
debug some strange behaviour, and I couldn't use the graphical tools for
Linux, because I didn't want to install all that bloat on my servers. Just
looking at the numbers in top doesn't give you much of an idea of how
it's fluctuating over time.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11746f2.large.jpg"><img src="11746f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. A Flurry of Early Commits
</p></div></div><p>
I started hashing out the initial version, not worrying too much about
the tidiness of the code (I was trying to debug a problem quickly after
all). I ended up getting carried away with it, and I almost forgot to go
back and debug my original issue.
</p><p>
I ran the code on the remote server and was delighted at how immediately
useful it was, even in its crude and ugly form. I committed the code and
showed it to my colleagues at work. The reaction was a mixture of delight
(&ldquo;How do you even do that?&rdquo;) and horror (at my sloppy
programming &lt;blush&gt;),
but I knew this idea had legs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x227b580.0x2373a90"></a>
Write One to Throw Away</h2></div></div><p>
Worrying too much about the architecture early can be a waste of time.
It's usually best to write one to throw away, and this code base
certainly needed binning. The best structure for the application was
far more obvious once I had a working prototype.
</p><p>
I sketched out what I thought it should look like: a large area at
the top for CPU usage, then two smaller boxes for memory and a process
list. I started a new project and got to work.
</p><p>
I decided to write vtop using Node.js. It's built on Chrome's
V8 JavaScript engine and allows you to write fast and scalable
applications. This choice could pave the way for a Web-based front end
to be added in the future. JavaScript is coming into its own&mdash;it's
no longer the scrappy, badly implemented language that everyone used to
make sparkles follow their cursors on their Geocities pages. Node.js has
evolved the language&mdash;it's now a fully formed toolchain with a
thriving community. There's a Node package for just about anything you
can think of; you really can hit the ground running by picking up other
people's modules instead of writing from scratch.
</p><p>
At the beginning of the rewrite, I made an outline using simple box
drawing characters that I used to love playing with in my early DOS
programming days. Although this worked okay, I felt there might be an easier
way. I'd seen ncurses and wondered if there was anything more modern
kicking about. I eventually came across Blessed.
</p><p>
Blessed abstracts away the complexities of drawing a GUI in the
terminal. You tell it where to draw boxes, and they are 
resized automatically based on the terminal width and height. You also can listen to
scroll wheel and click events to enable even easier interaction. I
highly recommend checking it out.
</p><p>
I created a couple boxes in Blessed and populated the text content
of the first one with the Braille characters. Then I easily was able to
add different colors to the app.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x227b580.0x2373da8"></a>
Design Goals</h2></div></div><p>
The rewrite forced me to think about my design goals for the project. I
was keen to have other developers get involved, and hopefully, it can be
used for purposes I never imagined. The design goals can be distilled
to these three:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Extendible: plugins should be easy and quick to write, with clear separation
of UI code and data collection code. (There's still a little work to do
in this area.)
</p></li><li><p>
Accessible: when it comes to servers, the terminal rules the roost,
and nothing beats the convenience of being able to dive straight in over
SSH and fire up a command. That's not to say that a Web-based GUI would
be unwelcome, but each feature should work from the command line too.
</p></li><li><p>
Visual: it should take advantage of the latest and greatest
techniques&mdash;a visually appealing interface using color and Unicode characters to
great effect.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x227b580.0x2374118"></a>
Braille Display</h2></div></div><p>
Terminals have come a long way since the early days. xterm added
256-color support (which is just a sequence of escape codes printed out
as text) and mouse support (which is your terminal sending text escape
codes). Pretty much all terminal emulators support Unicode now, and in
vtop, we use this to our advantage.
</p><p>
Unicode Braille characters give you a convenient
8x2 grid of dots in every possible combination, starting at Unicode point
0x2800. We can use these as faux-pixels. You take a grid of coordinates,
and break it up into chunks for each character, and then just output them
to the screen like you would any other text. There are 256 combinations
(two states&mdash;on and off for each of the eight dots, which is
2<sup  >8</sup>), and
you can calculate which character you need by combining the hexadecimal
numbers for each Braille dot and adding that to the starting point.
Below are Braille Characters Representing a Slope on a Graph:

</p><p>
See <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/MrRio/90vdrs01/3/" target="_self">jsfiddle.net/MrRio/90vdrs01/3/</a>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11746f3.large.jpg"><img src="11746f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Hexadecimal Values for Each Braille Dot (Public Domain)
</p></div></div><p>
For example, the first character above would be 0x1 + 0x2 + 0x4 + 0x40 +
0x10 + 0x20 + 0x80 = 0xF7, then add this to the base of 0x2800 to get
0x28F7. You can try this in your browser's JavaScript panel:

<pre     class="programlisting">
String.fromCharCode(0x1 + 0x2 + 0x4 + 0x40 + 0x10 
 &#8618;+ 0x20 + 0x80 + 0x2800);
</pre>
</p><p>
There's a brilliant Node.js library that abstracts away this detail
for you called node-drawille. It allows you to plot onto a canvas and
returns Braille characters using the same method described here.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x227b580.0x2374698"></a>
Other Features</h2></div></div><p>
The main feature is the graphical interface, but it has a few other
tricks up its sleeve:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Vim-like keybindings: if you use vim, your muscle memory
is tied to its keyboard shortcuts. Type j/k to move up and down the list
and h/l to change the scale on the graphs. The arrow keys work fine too!
</p></li><li><p>
Grouped processes: vtop will group together processes with the same
name. Many applications are multiprocess&mdash;for example, Google Chrome
spawns a new process for each tab to increase stability and security. You
can get a true overall value of the CPU percentage it's taking up. It's
also great for monitoring Web servers like Apache and nginx.
</p></li><li><p>
Killing processes: simply type <tt  >dd</tt> to make a process die. This is
also the vim shortcut for deleting a line.
</p></li><li><p>
Sorting by CPU or memory: typing <tt  >c</tt> will sort the list
by CPU;
no prizes for guessing which key you press to sort by memory.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x227b580.0x2374b68"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Simply install npm with your favourite package manager. Then to 
install the command globally, just type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
npm -g install vtop
</pre>
</p><p>
Upgrade notifications appear within the application, and it can be upgraded
with a single key stroke.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x227b580.0x236b5b0"></a>
Contributing</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Getting Started with the Codebase:</b></span>
</p><p>
First off, start by forking the project on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/MrRio/vtop" target="_self">https://github.com/MrRio/vtop</a>.
</p><p>
One you've got your own fork, you can clone the source from GitHub (make
sure to replace &ldquo;MrRio&rdquo; with your own GitHub user name):

<pre     class="programlisting">
git clone git@github.com:MrRio/vtop.git
cd vtop
make
./bin/vtop.js
</pre>
</p><p>
The last command runs your development version of vtop rather than the
globally installed one.
</p><p>
Now you can begin hacking with the code.
</p><p>
To give you an idea of where to start, let me guide you through the
main areas of the application. The entry point for the application is
bin/vtop.js. This is a hybrid JS file and shell executable. It first
runs as a shell script, detects the name of the node executable (which
differs depending on the platform), enables xterm-256color and then runs
itself as JavaScript. It then includes the main app.js file in the root.
</p><p>
Then the app.js file loads in the required libraries, the most important
of which are Drawille for the Braille output, Blessed for the GUI
and commander, which is used to parse command-line options. It then globs
the themes/ directory for a list of themes and loads itself up via the
init() function.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
drawHeader is responsible for drawing the title bar, with the time
and any update notifications.
</p></li><li><p>
drawFooter prints all the available commands across the footer and a
link to the Web site.
</p></li><li><p>
drawChart is responsible for drawing Braille charts, and drawTable for
the process list, although this could do with refactoring into new files
to allow for more display options to be contributed.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Sensors are loaded in from the sensors/ folder and polled at the desired
frequency. Then the draw methods take this data and push it on to
the screen.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Themes:</b></span>
</p><p>
A theme is a simple JSON file containing foreground and background colors
for each element. Simply bob your theme into the themes/ directory, and
then run <tt  >vtop -theme yourtheme</tt>. Send a Pull Request, and as long as it
isn't too similar to another theme, we'll include it.
</p><p>
The themes files are broken up per component and handed straight over to Blessed's
style parameter for each component. It's possible to change the characters
used for the box lines, or even add bold and underline (check out
the Blessed documentation at <a href="https://github.com/chjj/blessed" target="_self">https://github.com/chjj/blessed</a> for more information):

Sensors:</b></span>
</p><p>
vtop currently has three sensors, CPU, Memory and Process List. A sensor has
a title, a type (which decides the kind of renderer to use), a polling
frequency with a function and a currentValue. The sensors know nothing
about the UI, and their sole job is to output a single number or a list
for the table type. vtop then takes this information and plots it out.
</p><p>
Sensors may need extending with more properties and methods depending on
the kinds of things people want to build with them. For example, an Apache
req/s sensor may need to be able to report its largest value, so vtop
can adjust the scale, or the memory sensor could be extended to report
multiple values for used, buffered, cached and free memory.
</p><p>
The following is an example sensor file&mdash;as you can see, they're pretty
straightforward to write. Why not try modifying the file to have it
report something else:

<pre     class="programlisting">
 /**
 * CPU Usage sensor
 *
 * (c) 2014 James Hall
 */
var os = require('os-utils');
var plugin = {
 /**
 * This appears in the title of the graph
 */
 title: 'CPU Usage',
 /**
 * The type of sensor
 * @type {String}
 */
 type: 'chart',
 /**
 * The default interval time in ms that this plugin 
 * should be polled. More costly benchmarks should 
 * be polled less frequently.
 */
 interval: 200,
 initialized: false,
 currentValue: 0,
 /**
 * Grab the current value, from 0-100
 */
 poll: function() {
   os.cpuUsage(function(v){
     plugin.currentValue = (Math.floor(v * 100));
     plugin.initialized = true;
   });
  }
};
module.exports = exports = plugin;
</pre>
</p><p>
If you have a basic understanding of JS, you can see how simple building
a sensor really is. If you can give vtop a number, it can plot it. You
could get these from existing npm modules or by parsing output of other
Linux command-line utilities.

Submitting a Pull Request</h2></div></div><p>
There are many tutorials on the Internet for getting started with Git (the
<a href="http://git-scm.com" target="_self">git-scm.com</a> Web site is good). It's
much less scary than you think. 
</p><p>
For features, simply make a branch called
&ldquo;feature/name-of-feature&rdquo;
and for bugfixes, &ldquo;bugfix/name-of-fix&rdquo;. Don't worry about getting it
perfect first time. Send your code in early for feedback, and people will
help you refine it and get the code into the master branch.
</p><p>
I look forward to seeing what you come up with!

Other Monitoring Software</h2></div></div><p>
There's more than one way to skin a cat, and this is especially true on
Linux. I've rounded up a few of my favorite monitoring tools outside
the usual top command. Some of these tools even may be easily integrated
into vtop as sensors.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>htop:</b></span>
</p><p>
This is a feature-rich interactive process viewer and has been around
for years. The author tweeted me to ask if he could use the Braille
graphing idea. I'm very excited to see how this develops
(<a href="https://twitter.com/hisham_hm/status/477618055452037120" target="_self">https://twitter.com/hisham_hm/status/477618055452037120</a>).

</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>iotop:</b></span>
</p><p>
This is a great tool for measuring applications that are hammering your
Input/Output. It calculates the number of bytes used. It's written in
Python and parses information out of /proc/vmstat.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
netstat:</b></span>
</p><p>
This ships as part of Linux and Windows, and it allows you to see all open
connections. It's often useful to pipe this command into
<tt  >more</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
netstat | more
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
apachetop:</b></span>
</p><p>
This parses Apache (and Apache-compatible) log files on the fly to give
you real-time requests, per-second stats, most popular pages and more. It's
very
handy for monitoring AJAX and other Web requests that aren't tracked in your
favourite Web-based analytics.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
NetHogs:</b></span>
</p><p>
This a great tool to see where all your Internet bandwidth is going. It
lists each hog individually by KB/sec. It doesn't require you to load any special
kernel modules&mdash;just fire it up and find the offending
process straightaway.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Slurm:</b></span>
</p><p>
This tool helps you visualize network activity on your system by plotting
red and green &ldquo;x&rdquo; characters.

The Future</h2></div></div><p>
It's time to think more about how our computers can represent data
over time, and how we can use tools that are more visual than top. What do you
want from a system monitor? Do you need to see what's going on inside
an app? Do you need to see the number of Web server requests, the
temperature of sensors or
the throughput of a database server? What other visualizations could be
done with Braille or other characters?
