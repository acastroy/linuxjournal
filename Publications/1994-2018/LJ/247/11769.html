Every time I write a Bash script or schedule a cron job, I worry about the
day I'll star in my very own IT version of a Folger's commercial. Instead
of &ldquo;secretly replacing coffee with Folger's Instant Crystals&rdquo;, however,
I worry I'll be replaced by an automation framework and a few crafty
FOR loops. If you've ever had nightmares like that, you're in the right
place. The truth is, the need for system administrators isn't going
down&mdash;it's just that our job function is shifting a little. If you stay
current, and resolve to be a lifelong learner, system administration
is as incredible as it's always been. (And far better than instant
coffee! Yuck!) This month, we focus on system administration. It keeps
us all relevant, all informed and most important, we should all learn
a little something along the way.

Reuven M. Lerner starts off the issue discussing the power of NoSQL databases
using PostgreSQL. If that seems like a contradiction in terms, you'll want
to read his column for more details. Dave Taylor follows up with part two in
his series on a script-based dream interpreter. You also will learn a few handy
scripting tips along the way that will be useful regardless of the project
you're creating. When the series is done, perhaps the dream interpreter can
help me figure out my recurring nightmare of being Winnie the Pooh being
hunted by angry bees. Or maybe I should just lay off the honey for my tea.

Kyle Rankin discusses DNS this month, but instead of setting up DNSSEC,
he describes how to set up DNS caches to make your networks more efficient. While
Kyle doesn't normally care for dnsmasq as a DNS/DHCP d&aelig;mon, in this
article,
he turns to it for its caching abilities. If you see your internal DNS
servers getting hammered, a caching situation might be just what you
need. I follow Kyle with an article on DevOps. Although it makes sense to
start a series on DevOps tools like Chef, Puppet, Ansible and so on, the
first thing to do is understand what DevOps is all about. If you
ask six people to define DevOps, you'll get a dozen different answers. This
month, I try to clear up any confusion or misconceptions, so that you can
benefit from the DevOps idea rather than be scared or confused by it.

No system administration issue would be complete without addressing the
most important issue facing the sysadmin. No, it's not uptime&mdash;it's backups. David
Barton walks through using zbackup, which is a deduplicating system
for backing up massive amounts of data as efficiently as possible. When
a single desktop hard drive can hold 4TB of data or more, the task of
backing up becomes monumental. David makes it a little more manageable.
</p><p>
Petros Koutoupis follows David with that other topic sysadmins are
concerned with: uptime. Migrating data from one system to another often
is expensive and time-consuming, and it usually means proprietary SAN storage. With
the advent of High-Availability Logical Volume Management (HA-LVM), that
same flexibility comes to folks using commodity hardware and open-source
tools. Petros explains the concept and process for creating and
maintaining highly available LVM solutions for the data center.

System administrators know that although central authentication is
a key to a successful network infrastructure, there also are local
accounts on servers and devices that must be kept local, and yet still
used. J.D. Baldwin shows an elegant way to manage those local SSH
accounts by leveraging ssh-agent to store authentication keys. If you've
ever had to change the password on 100 servers because an employee left
the company, you understand the problem. J.D. has an awesome solution.
</p><p>
Finally, James Hall describes the process he used when developing
the incredibly cool vtop program. A graphical activity monitor for the
command line alone is a enough to warrant an article, but James covers
his entire process from planning to creating to improving. Even
if you have no interest in using a CLI GUI-based program, it's a great
way to learn about the open-source journey. If you want to see how an
idea becomes a package, James' article is perfect.
</p><p>
We've also got a ton of tips, tricks, hints and pointers throughout
the issue. If you want to hear about the latest product announcements,
or just discover our favorite app of the month, this issue aims to
please. Whether you're a system administrator, a developer or even a
new Linux user getting your open-source feet wet, we hope you enjoy this
issue as much as we enjoyed putting it together.
