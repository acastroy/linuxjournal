<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #247, November 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Hardware errors are tough to code for. In some cases, they're impossible to
code for. A particular brand of hardware error is the <span   class="bold"><b>Machine-Check
Exception</b></span> (MCE), which means a CPU has a problem. On <span   class="bold"><b>Windows</b></span> systems, it's
one of the causes of the Blue Screen of Death.
</p><p>
Everyone wants to handle hardware errors well, because it can mean the
difference between getting a little indication of what actually went wrong
and getting no information at all.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Andy Lutomirski</b></span> recently suggested some
code to clean up <span   class="bold"><b>non-maskable
interrupts</b></span> (NMIs), which also typically indicate some sort of hardware
failure. But over the course of discussion, folks raised questions about
how to handle various cases&mdash;for example, when an MCE came immediately
after an NMI. Typically NMIs are not interruptable by any other code, but
should an exception be made for MCEs? If the OS detects a CPU error while
already processing another hardware error, should it defer to the more
pressing CPU issue or not?
</p><p>
There was a bit of debate, but ultimately <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> said that an MCE
meant that the system was dead. Any attempt to handle that in software, he
said, was just in order to crash as gracefully as possible. But he felt
that the kernel should not make any complicated effort in that case, since
the end result would just be the same crash. Deadlocks, race conditions
and other issues that normally would be important, simply weren't in this
case. Make a best effort to log the event, he said, and forget the rest.
</p><p>
Elsewhere, he elaborated more vociferously, saying, &ldquo;MCE is frankly
misdesigned. It's a piece of shit, and any of the hardware designers that
claim that what they do is for system stability are out to lunch. This is a
prime example of what <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to do, and how you can actually spread what was
potentially a localized and recoverable error, and make it global and
unrecoverable.&rdquo; And he added:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Synchronous MCEs are fine for synchronous errors, but then trying to turn
them &ldquo;synchronous&rdquo; for other CPUs (where they <span   class="emphasis"><em>weren't</em></span> synchronous
errors) is a major mistake. External errors punching through irq context is
wrong, punching through NMI is just inexcusable.
</p><p>
If the OS then decides to take down the whole machine, the OS&mdash;not the
hardware&mdash;can choose to do something that will punch through other
CPUs'
NMI blocking (notably, init/reset), but the hardware doing this on its own
is just broken if true.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Tony Luck</b></span> pointed out that <span   class="bold"><b>Intel</b></span> actually was planning to fix this in
future machines, although he acknowledged that turn-around time for chips
was likely to be very long. However, as <span   class="bold"><b>Borislav
Petkov</b></span> pointed out, even
after the fix went in, Linux still would need to support the bad hardware.
</p><p>
The tightrope-walk of <span   class="bold"><b>container security</b></span> has some controversy. One group
believes that containers should be able to do whatever an independent
system could do. Another group believes that certain abilities render the
container inherently insecure. The first group says that without these
features, the container isn't truly offering a complete environment. The
second group says that's how the cookie crumbles.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Seth Forshee</b></span> recently posted some patches
to allow containerized systems to
see <span   class="bold"><b>hot-plugged devices</b></span>, just the way a non-containerized system could. But
this, apparently, was a bridge too far. <span   class="bold"><b>Greg
Kroah-Hartman</b></span> said he had
long since expressed a clear policy against adding namespaces to devices.
And, that was exactly how Seth's code made the hot-plugged devices visible
to the containerized system.
</p><p>
It turns out that there are valid use-cases for wanting a containerized
system to be able to see hot-plugged devices. <span   class="bold"><b>Michael
H. Warfield</b></span> described
one such. And, Seth described his own&mdash;he needed hot-plug support in order
to implement <span   class="bold"><b>loopback devices</b></span> within the container.
</p><p>
Greg said loopback support in a container was a very bad idea, since it
provided all sorts of opportunities to leak data out of the container and
into the host system&mdash;a security violation.
</p><p>
He said this was not a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; use-case for containers. To
which <span   class="bold"><b>Serge
Hallyn</b></span> replied that any feature used by a non-containerized system was a
&ldquo;normal&rdquo; use case for containerized systems.
</p><p>
Serge argued that these features inevitably would go into containers. There
was no way to keep them out. As long as containers excluded features that
were included in non-containerized systems, there would be people with an
incentive to bridge the gap. Why not bridge it now and fix the bugs as
they showed up?
</p><p>
But Richard said, &ldquo;There are so many things that can hurt you badly. With
user namespaces, we expose a really big attack surface to regular users.
[...] I agree that user namespaces are the way to go, all the papering with
LSM over security issues is much worse. But we have to make sure that we
don't add too many features too fast.&rdquo;
</p><p>
And, Greg added that Seth's code was too hacky, implementing just what Seth
needed, rather than addressing the overarching issue of how to
handle namespaces properly within a container.
</p><p>
Greg also said he supported loopback devices within containers, but he and
<span   class="bold"><b>James Bottomley</b></span> said that the security issues were real, and the
implementation had to take account of them. It wasn't enough simply
to implement the feature and then fix bugs. The feature needed a proper
design that addressed these concerns.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Party Like It's 1994!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #247, November 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I really stink at video games. I write about gaming occasionally, but the
truth of the matter is, I'm just not very good. If we play
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span>, you'll
frag me just about as often as I respawn. I don't have great reflexes, and
my coordination is horrible. But if you give me an RPG, a 12-pack of Coke,
and a three-day weekend, I'll be a level 96 blood elf by dawn of the second day.
</p><p>
Yes, in my youth I was a bit of a nerd. I stayed home weekends playing
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Chrono-trigger</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Secret of
Mana</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Zelda</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dragon
Warrior</em></span> and, of course,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Final Fantasy</em></span>. I was happy to discover the other day that those same
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Final Fantasy</em></span> games I loved as a youngster are available in all their
remade glory on the Android platform! They are unfortunately a little
pricey, with each installment weighing in at $15.99, but they've been re-created
specifically for the touch screen, and they are really fun!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11761androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="11761androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
If you wonder which game to buy (and you don't plan to buy them all, like
some of us did), I highly recommend <span   class="emphasis"><em>Final Fantasy VI</em></span>. It was the best
game on the Super Nintendo, and I think it's the best game on Android as
well. Of course, if you're okay with slightly more awkward gameplay, the old
titles are easy to find in ROM format in the questionable corners of the
Internet. There are several really good SNES emulators for Android that
will allow you to play those original ROM files completely free. Honestly,
however, if you can afford the $15.99, the remakes are far more enjoyable
to play.

One of my career iterations put me in charge of a Windows server
that had Apache and PHP installed on it to serve as a Web server for
the corporate intranet. Although I was happy to see Apache used as the
Web server d&aelig;mon, the installation on the Windows server was the most
confusing and horrifying mess I've ever seen. To this day, I'm not sure
which of the three Apache instances was actually serving files, and there
were at least six PHP folders in various places on the hard drive, each
with a different version number.
</p><p>
If you're in a situation where you're required to use Windows, but don't
want to worry about the nightmare of installing Apache and PHP (much
less MySQL) on your machine, I urge you to check out XAMMP. It's not
a new program, but that's one of its greatest features. It's basically
just a single installer for Windows, OS X or Linux that installs Apache
with PHP and MySQL. Its maturity means that even on a Windows system,
it should install and work like you'd expect open-source software to work.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11761fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="11761fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Although XAMMP can be used to serve files to the actual Internet, it was
designed for individuals to install on their own workstations to test their
code. And in that situation, it works really well. If you have a server
connected to the Internet, I still recommend using a Linux server with
a proper Apache/PHP installation, but if you're stuck using a Windows
workstation, XAMMP can give you a stable, open-source Web server platform
that you can rely on. Grab a copy at <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org" target="_self">www.apachefriends.org</a>.

<h2 class="title">Drafting on Linux</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #247, November 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
One common scientific task is designing new hardware to help make
measurements. A powerful tool to help with this design work is a Computer
Aided Design system, or CAD software. Several tools are available
on Linux for doing CAD work. In this article, I take a look at LibreCAD
(<a href="http://www.librecad.org" target="_self">www.librecad.org</a>). 
</p><p>
LibreCAD started as an extension of QCad. For a short while, it was called
CADuntu, before finally being named LibreCAD.
It should be available as a package in most distributions. 
</p><p>
In
Debian-based distributions, you can install it with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install librecad
</pre>
</p><p>
And, you always can install it from source if you want the latest and
greatest features.
</p><p>
Once LibreCAD is installed, you can launch it from the application
launcher for your desktop, or you can run the 
<tt  >librecad</tt> command from a
terminal. The first time you start LibreCAD, you will be greeted
with a welcome window (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11761libf1.large.jpg"><img src="11761libf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. When you start LibreCAD the first time, you need to
set some initial options.
</p></div></div><p>
Here, you will be presented with the ability to set options for the
default unit, the GUI language and the command language. Once you set
those options, you will see a blank canvas where you can start your new
project (Figure 2). The main window is the actual drawing canvas
where you can set up your design. On the left-hand side, you should see a
palette of drawing tools. On the right-hand side, you will see two smaller
windows containing the layer list and the block list for your design.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11761libf2.large.jpg"><img src="11761libf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. LibreCAD starts up with a blank canvas, ready for your
new project.
</p></div></div><p>
If you already have done some design work, you can import that work
into LibreCAD. You can insert an image to your design by clicking the
menu item File&rarr;Import&rarr;Insert Image. LibreCAD can handle most common
file formats. If you had been working with another CAD program and have
a DXF file of that work, you can import it by clicking on the menu item
File&rarr;Import&rarr;Block (Figure 3). This option also handles CXF
files, in case you were using those. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11761libf3.large.jpg"><img src="11761libf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. You can import DXF files from lots of places.
</p></div></div><p>
You may have a text file with raw
point data for the object you are trying to draw. If so, you can click
on the menu item File&rarr;Import&rarr;Read ascii points. This will pop up an
option window where you can define what the points represent and how to
treat them. You even can import GIS data from a shape file
with the menu item File&rarr;Import&rarr;shape file.
</p><p>
Now you should be ready to start designing your project. Clicking
the icons in the palette on the left-hand side opens a new palette with
multiple options for each of the categories. For example, if you click on
the circle icon, you will see a new palette giving you the option to draw
circles with either two points on the circumference, a point at the center
and one at the circumference or a circle that fits within a triangle,
among many other options. 
</p><p>
The other icons in the drawing palette also
provide tools for drawing many other components, such as lines, arcs and
splines. All of these items are drawn on the default layer that you get with
a new project. You can add a new layer by clicking the plus icon in the
top pane on the right-hand side. This will pop up a new option window
where you can set things like the layer name and the drawing color for
the new layer (Figure 4). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11761libf4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. You can set options for new layers added to your
project.
</p></div></div><p>
You can toggle visibility of the various
layers by clicking the eye icon to the right in the layer list. When
you have a layer set the way you want it, you can make it uneditable by
clicking on the lock icon for that layer. That way, you won't accidentally
change it while you work on other layers. 
</p><p>
If you need to add labels
explaining parts of your design, you can click on the multi-line text
option in the tool palette. This will pop up a window where you can
enter the text and set options like font and color (Figure 5).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11761libf5.large.jpg"><img src="11761libf5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. You can set several options when you add a multi-line
text object.
</p></div></div><p>
Once you have the basic objects drawn on your project, you can use the
many modification tools available to fine-tune your drawing
or to generate more complex objects based on some modification of one
of the basic types. These modifications are available under the 
Modify menu item. You can do things like scaling, mirroring, rotating and
moving. 
</p><p>
Using these tools, however, isn't very intuitive. Say you want to scale an
element of your drawing. The first thing you will want to do is to click
on the Modify&rarr;Scale menu item. You next will notice that the
command-line box at the bottom of the window has changed, asking you to
&ldquo;Select
to scale&rdquo;. You then need to click on the element you want to scale, say
a line element, and press the Enter key. The command-line window then
will change to saying &ldquo;Specify reference point&rdquo;. LibreCAD scales based on a
reference point to act as a point of perspective, so go ahead and click on
a point. This will pop up an option window where you can set things like
the scaling factor and whether it is isotropic (Figure 6).
When you click OK, LibreCAD will apply the modification and refresh the
drawing.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11761libf6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. You can set several options for scaling an element of
your drawing.
</p></div></div><p>
You also can change the properties of the different elements,
which may be needed to clarify parts of special interest. To do this,
you need to click on the Modify&rarr;Properties menu item, and then
click on the element in question. This will pop up a dialog box where
you can edit properties that apply for that element type (Figure 7).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11761libf7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. You can change both the display properties of your
circle as well as the physical properties.
</p></div></div><p>
When you have finished your design, you will want to share it
with others. The default file format is the Drawing Exchange Format
(.dxf). LibreCAD supports versions 2007, 2004, 2000, R14 and R12. If
you need to, you also can save it as an LFF Font file (.lff), a QCad file
(.cxf) or a Jww Drawing file (.jww). If you just want a simplified output,
you can click on the File&rarr;Export menu item and save it in one of a
large number of image file formats. With these options, you should be
able to share your design with most people.
</p><p>
Hopefully, this article has shown you enough to help you decide whether
LibreCAD might be a good fit for your next design project. If so, you
can find even more information on the LibreCAD Wiki and forum.
A great deal of examples are available on the Internet that will show you
just what is possible with a good CAD system. And, because these examples are available in
DXF files, you can load them in LibreCAD and play with the possibilities.

<h2 class="title">The Awesome Program You Never Should Use</h2>

I've been hesitating for a couple months about whether to mention
sshpass. Conceptually, it's a horrible, horrible program. It basically
allows you to enter an SSH user name and password on the command line,
so you can create a connection without any interaction. A far better
way to accomplish that is with public/private keypairs. But it's still
something I find useful from time to time, and I'd rather mention it
with all the warnings in the world than to pretend it doesn't exist.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11761sshf1.large.jpg"><img src="11761sshf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
So, sshpass&mdash;it's a simple tool, but in a pinch, it can be incredibly
helpful. You use it with the user name and password as command-line
arguments (with some variations, see the help screen in the screenshot),
and it injects them into your <tt  >ssh</tt> (or
<tt  >scp</tt>) command.
</p><p>
Again, this is a horribly insecure method for entering passwords. However, I find
it particularly useful for setting up new machines, especially
computers or devices in a closed environment. I've also used it to
send files via <tt  >scp</tt> to hundreds of machines in my local network that
I'll never need to connect to again. It's a dangerous tool, but can be
a lifesaver if you need it. Search your distribution's repositories,
as it's available for most systems. And remember, don't ever use it!

<h2 class="title">Tomahawk, the World Is Your Music Collection</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #247, November 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I don't listen to music very often, but when I do, my tastes tend to
be across the board. That's one of the reasons I really like Pandora,
because the music selection is incredible (in fact, I can't recommend
the Pithos client for Pandora enough&mdash;I've written about it in past
issues). Unfortunately, with Pandora, you don't get to pick specific
songs. That's usually okay for me, but sometimes I want to hear a particular
song by a particular artist. Even worse, sometimes I want to hear a
particular version of a song. I've purchased 3&ndash;4 different versions of
a song, only to discover none of them were what I wanted.
</p><p>
Enter Tomahawk. It behaves much like a traditional music application,
and it will play music from your hard drive or network shares. Its real
strength, however, is its ability to connect to on-line resources to
find songs. When it finds those songs, it treats them just like a local
file. You can create playlists with a mix of local and remote media,
and search across an entire array of on-line services. Tomahawk will
connect to Spotify, last.fm, Jamendo, Beets, Subsonic and tons of other
sources. Of particular note, I love that there is a YouTube plugin that
will search YouTube for songs! (The YouTube plugin isn't included by
default, but it's free to install.)

</p></div></div><p>
Due to its ability to blur the lines between local and streaming media,
while functioning as a traditional desktop music app, Tomahawk earns
this month's Editors' Choice award. If you have fickle music tastes,
or just want to listen to your various music collections in a central
place, I urge you to give Tomahawk a try: <a href="http://www.tomahawk-player.org" target="_self">www.tomahawk-player.org</a>.
