Wibu-Systems' CodeMeter Embedded Driver</h2></div></div><p>
Embedded systems developers seeking to protect their IPs are the target
customers for Wibu-Systems' CodeMeter Embedded Driver, a comprehensive
security solution that secures embedded software against
reverse-engineering by encrypting and signing the binary code. CodeMeter
protects embedded systems, programmable logic controllers and industrial
PCs. The new CodeMeter Embedded Driver 1.7&mdash;a rebranded version of a
product called CodeMeter Compact Driver 1.6&mdash;offers new features and
functionality that are applicable specifically to embedded systems. New
features include an option to use the HID mode on dongles for communication
with the device without displaying drive status, protection of the secure
boot process, support for the file I/O interface for Linux and Android, and
support for the Secure Disk standard for reading and writing API-based data
without enumeration by the operating system. The driver is available for
VxWorks 7.0, Linux Embedded, Windows Embedded, Android and QNX, as well as
for different ARM, x86 and PowerPC platforms.

Linutop OS</h2></div></div><p>
Intruders beware, because the new Linutop OS 14.04 is here&mdash;the easiest way
to set up an ultra-secure PC, says its maker Linutop. Linutop OS 14.04 is a
customized version of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS that comes loaded with the light
XFCE classic graphic environment, as well as an array of ready-to-use Linux
applications, such as Firefox 28, LibreOffice 4, VLC 2 and Linutop Kiosk.
Version 14.04 offers three core enhancements, namely a Linutop Kiosk for a
secured Internet access point, Digital Signage functionality for display of
any media type and enhanced security and privacy. Linutop's system can
be locked in read-only mode, preventing alterations by viruses or other
mishaps. Linutop requires only a minimal HD space (850MB) and requires
minimal processing power: PIII 800MHz and 512MB of RAM. Linutop OS can
be installed quickly on a hard drive, USB key or Flash memory.

Logic Supply's ML400 Series Industrial PCs</h2></div></div><p>
For Logic Supply, the new ML400 Series of industrial PCs is more than just
the next step in the evolution of its product line. Rather, says Logic,
it's a distinct break from the &ldquo;black box&rdquo; paradigm that has ruled the
industrial hardware market. Logic Supply's new ML400 Series is a line of
high-performance, boldly styled, rugged Mini-ITX systems for commercial
applications where reliability is paramount. These fanless, ventless PCs
are the company's smallest to date and are engineered for use in harsh
environments. The models available at launch for the ML400 series offer a
versatile range of I/O and Intel processing capabilities, advanced EMI
protection and next-generation storage in order to maintain an
ultra-compact footprint.

Red Hat Software Collections</h2></div></div><p>
In order to keep up with developers' needs while maintaining production
stability, Red Hat keeps the Red Hat Software Collections' release schedule
at a more frequent release schedule than RHEL. The Collections, recently
upgraded to v1.2, is a package of essential Web development tools, dynamic
languages, open-source databases, C and C++ compilers, the Eclipse IDE, and
a variety of development and performance management tools. These updated
components can be installed alongside versions included in base Red Hat
Enterprise Linux. Highlights of the upgrade are the Red Hat Developer
Toolset 3.0, included in the Collections for the first time and also bringing
the Eclipse IDE to RHEL 7 for the first time; DevAssistant 0.9.1, a tool
for setting up development environments and publishing code; Maven 3.0, a
build automation tool for Java projects; Git 1.9.4, which previously was
only part of the Red Hat Developer Toolset; Nginx 1.6 Web server and Web
proxy; and the latest stable versions of popular dynamic languages and
open-source databases. Red Hat Software Collections 1.2 is available to
eligible users of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

Sven Vermeulen's <span   class="emphasis"><em>SELinux Cookbook</em></span> (Packt Publishing)</h2></div></div><p>
If you are a Linux system or service administrator and want to (wisely)
burnish your SELinux skills, then Packt Publishing and tech author Sven
Vermeulen have a book for you. It's called <span   class="emphasis"><em>SELinux
Cookbook</em></span>, and it carries a
breathless subtitle that sums it up better than any bumbling Linux
journalist could: &ldquo;Over 100 hands-on recipes to develop fully functional
policies to confine your applications and users using SELinux&rdquo;. These
policies can be custom to users' own needs, and users can build readable
policy rules from them. Readers can learn further about the wide range of
security controls that SELinux offers by customizing Web application
confinement. Finally, readers will understand how some applications
interact with the SELinux subsystem internally, ensuring that they can
confront any challenge they face. Author Sven Vermeulen is the project lead
of Gentoo Hardened's SELinux integration project and wrote Packt's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SELinux
System Administration</em></span> book as well.

Opera Software ASA's Opera TV Ads SDK</h2></div></div><p>
Over time, Opera has become much more than a browser maker. Opera's latest
development is part of the company's somewhat new niche in the media
convergence space: Opera TV Ads SDK. The new solution is targeted at app
publishers, Smart TV device manufacturers and pay-TV operators seeking to
better monetize their content by serving video advertising on any platform.
Opera TV Ads SDK previously was available exclusively to apps distributed
via the Opera TV Store application platform and developed through the Opera
TV Snap technology. With this new release, the solution is available as a
standalone feature for any HTML5 app or Smart TV device, whether on the
Opera TV Store or other application platforms. Opera says that Opera TV Ads
SDK offers a one-stop solution for placement of video advertising anywhere
inside the device user interface, including targeting users across apps and
interactive advertising via linear broadcast.
