fondly remember spending many hours leafing through the first
edition of O'Reilly's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming Perl</em></span> (also
known as &ldquo;the Camel Book&rdquo;), an excellent book covering the Perl
programming language up to version 4.0.36. That book was
well-written, technically correct and very witty. Two chapters of
the first edition of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming Perl</em></span> I was
particularly fond of, &ldquo;Common Tasks with Perl&rdquo; and &ldquo;Real Perl
Programs&rdquo; contained numerous common tasks and real programs using
Perl.
</p><p>In 1996, O'Reilly published the second edition of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming Perl</em></span>, an excellent book covering
all features of Perl including those features new to Perl version
5. The size of the book expanded from 465 pages in the first
edition to a whopping 645 pages in the second. Many topics new to
Perl 5 were added to the second edition, including a discussion of
references and object-oriented programming. However, due to its
size, portions of the first edition could not be covered in the
second. Therefore, parts of the first edition were deleted,
including my favorite &ldquo;Common Tasks with Perl&rdquo; and &ldquo;Real Perl
Programs&rdquo; chapters.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Perl Cookbook</em></span> (also known as &ldquo;the Ram
Book&rdquo;) is a companion to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming Perl</em></span>,
expanding the chapters of real Perl programs in the first edition
of the Camel book to a massive 757 pages of thoroughly explained,
useful Perl code. In this book, Tom Christiansen and Nathan
Torkington cover many topics providing numerous code examples known
as recipes (it is a &ldquo;cookbook&rdquo;, after all). The introduction
claims it is not a tutorial nor a reference, but rather states
&ldquo;this is a book for learning <span   class="emphasis"><em>more</em></span> Perl&rdquo;. And
so it is.</p><p>This is a book for all types of Perl programmers from
beginner to expert. If you are looking for a book with hundreds of
examples to cut and paste, or something that explains in detail how
to do many different things using Perl, this book is for
you.</p><p>The book starts with recipes to handle Perl's basic data
types. Each of the following five topics gets its own chapter:
strings, numbers, dates and times, arrays and hashes.</p><p>Chapter 6 discusses pattern matching and goes into great
detail on using Perl's regular expressions.</p><p>Chapters 7, 8 and 9 deal with file access, file contents and
directories. Chapter 10 discusses subroutines (check out the nifty
programs to sort e-mail at the end of this chapter).</p><p>Chapters 11, 12 and 13 discuss references, packages,
libraries, modules, classes, object and ties. These topics are
traditionally difficult to master with Perl, yet I found these
chapters to be well-written and understandable. I was particularly
impressed with the section on using
<span   class="bold"><b>tie</b></span> at the end of Chapter
13.</p><p>Chapter 14 covers database access, including UNIX DBM
databases and the DBI module. Chapter 15 discusses user interfaces
from the terminal, the Tk interface and the Expect programming
language.</p><p>The remaining five chapters discuss networking with Perl.
Topics include process management and communication, sockets,
Internet services, CGI programming and web automation.</p><p>I have found this book to be extremely helpful, technically
excellent and loaded with useful and usable source code. For
example, I recently wrote a CGI program that accepts a
floating-point number from the user, and I wanted to use a regular
expression to verify that the number entered was valid. I thought
to myself, &ldquo;Hmm, I can either create the regular expression
myself, or see if this issue is covered in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Perl
Cookbook</em></span>.&rdquo; Noting that &ldquo;Laziness&rdquo; is one of the three
primary virtues of a Perl programmer, I decided to look in the
book. In the table of contents, I immediately found a recipe titled
&ldquo;Checking Whether a String Is a Valid Number&rdquo;. Sensing I was on
to something, I turned to page 44 and found the following regular
expression to verify correct C-style floating point numbers:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/^([+-]?)(?=\d|\.\d)\d*(\.\d*)?([Ee]([+-]?\d+))?$/
</pre><p>I suppose that, with a bit of time and a lot of testing, I
could have come up with a working regular expression. But I didn't
need to&mdash;the answer was found in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Perl
Cookbook</em></span>.
</p><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Perl Cookbook</em></span> has the answers to
many common Perl questions. Need to find all unique entries in a
list? Try page 102. Want to create a hash, but retrieve the
key/value pairs from the hash in the order entered? Turn to page
139. Want to POP your e-mail from your server? See page 656.</p><p>I especially liked Chapter 20, entitled &ldquo;Web Automation&rdquo;.
Did you know it takes only five lines of Perl code to submit a form
to a CGI program using the <b  >GET</b> method? This
example is from page 710:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
use LWP::Simple;
use URI::URL;
my $url =
url('http://www.perl.com/cgi-bin/cpan_mod');
$url-&gt;query_form(module =&gt; 'DB_File', readme =&gt; 1);
$content = get($url);
</pre><p>Mirroring a web page takes only two lines of code (from page
724):
<pre     class="programlisting">
use LWP::Simple;
mirror($URL, $local_filename);
</pre>


Code like this makes Perl the world's most useful programming
language. Examples like these make the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Perl
Cookbook</em></span> the most useful Perl book I own.
</p><p>The book contains a mountain of source code, all of which is
available from the O'Reilly FTP site
(ftp://ftp.oreilly.com/published/oreilly/perl/cookbook/). There,
you can find over 130 full-length programs as well as all of the
code snippets from the book.</p><p>Since this is a cookbook covering a number of topics, readers
looking for in-depth discussions of the topics mentioned above
should be aware of the fact that they are not covered in minute
detail. For instance, the chapter on CGI programming is a brief
description that will be excellent if you have some knowledge of
CGI, but if you are looking for in-depth discussion, you should
check out a CGI book. This makes sense&mdash;cookbooks are not
tutorials. They present recipes, with the assumption that you know
the basics.</p><p>In summary, if you are a Perl programmer, this book is
essential. If you are new to Perl and want to become a Perl
programmer, this book is highly recommended as a tool to learn more
Perl. If you are wondering what Perl is all about and what Perl can
do for you, this book deserves a look. If you haven't heard of
Perl, where have you been?</p></div></div>
