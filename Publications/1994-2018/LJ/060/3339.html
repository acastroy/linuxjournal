    Linux's biggest strengths has always been as an operating system
    for all
    types of servers: e-mail, web, boot, you name it. This makes it ideal
    for use in networking computers.

for some time now, so it should come as no surprise that we
included it in our 1999 editorial calendar. Network computers
provide Internet/intranet services at a fraction of the cost of a
PC. With the popularity of the World Wide Web, the network
computer's time has come&mdash;companies dealing in network computers
show high performance on the New York Stock Exchange.
</p><p>One of Linux's biggest strengths has always been as an
operating system for all types of servers: e-mail, web, boot, you
name it. This makes it ideal for use in networking computers.
IGEL's Etherminal proved Linux's worth as a thin client back in
1994 and has kept on proving it ever since. Last year, Corel's
NetWinder joined the ranks.</p><p>Whether you want to learn more about using Linux in your
network, how to easily access your network services or how to speed
up your network, this month we have the articles you need. In
addition to the features listed below, we also have two articles on
our web site (see &ldquo;Strictly On-line&rdquo; in the Table of Contents):
one explaining the DECnet protocol and one providing Perl scripts
for accessing your network. Also on the web is an article about how
one international company is using Linux for network
management.</p><p>Along with these articles on the web site is the second part
of last month's internationalization feature by Stephen Turnbull,
&ldquo;Alphabet Soup&rdquo;. In this follow-up, he discusses standardization
of character sets&mdash;don't miss it.</p><p>&ldquo;Strictly On-line&rdquo; articles can be found at

now major hardware vendors are jumping on the Linux bandwagon. At
the end of January, Hewlett-Packard Co. and Silicon Graphics, Inc.
both announced they would be providing Linux as an option on their
computers with Intel chips. Rumor has it that Compaq, IBM and Dell
will be following suit. Even Apple has said they will make Linux an
option. These companies are not doing this to become popular with
the open-software crowd&mdash;they are doing it to make money. They have
seen that a market clearly exists and are taking advantage of that
fact. More on making money with open-source software will be found
in our June <span   class="emphasis"><em>Enterprise Solutions</em></span>
