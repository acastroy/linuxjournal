    A review of this networking computer from Canada.

ever seen. The slick little grey box makes me think of those
cream-filled half-moon cakes with a little chunk taken off the
edges. Sitting in its green plastic base, it beckons with a single
deep red window up front and two status lights telling you
everything is fine. It is about the size of my notebook, but unlike
my notebook, it weighs next to nothing.
</p><p>My time with the NetWinder was up a few days ago, but I have
been hanging on to it due to problems in scheduling a drop-off time
with the Corel sales representative. On my first attempt to deliver
the unit, I stopped off at a customer's site, NetWinder in hand. It
took an hour before I was allowed to leave again, as everybody in
the office had to get a look. &ldquo;That's a computer?&rdquo; was heard time
and again, as was &ldquo;And it has <span   class="emphasis"><em>what</em></span> inside?&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Tell me again what it can do?&rdquo; If nothing else, the
NetWinder gets looks. Luckily, there's more here than just
looks.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3288f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The NetWinder fits into any decor!
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2464580.0x255cad8"></a>Specs</h2></div></div><p>The NetWinder is based on a 275MHz StrongARM SA-110 RISC
processor which delivers 250 MIPS. It comes with 32 or 64MB of RAM
and a 2, 4 or 6GB disk. There are two Ethernet interfaces, one 10
and one 10/100 fast Ethernet port. It draws 15 watts from its power
brick, about the equivalent of a couple of night lights. The
NetWinder WS also comes loaded with Perl for CGI scripting, the
Apache web server, FTP, TELNET and DNS services. Also included are
multimedia support, a 16-bit stereo sound card and 2MB SVGA/XVGA
video.</p><p>The unit I reviewed is actually a DM demo. That translates to
&ldquo;a little bit of WS, DM, GS and LC all rolled into one&rdquo;. Its OS
version is based on Red Hat 4.2 with some Corel extensions. By the
time you read this review, NetWinder will come preloaded with Red
Hat 5.1.</p><p>A few different configurations are available. At this moment,
there are five NetWinder configurations. The WS (Web Server) and
the DM (Development Machine) are currently shipping. The LC (Linux
Computer) should be out by the time you read this; I was told &ldquo;in
time for Christmas 1998&rdquo;. The other two models, the RM (Rack
Mount) and GS (Group Server), are expected in early 1999. Pricing
and configuration options are available from the Corel Computer web
site at http://www.corelcomputer.com/. The open source software and
updates are available at http://www.netwinder.org/.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2464580.0x255cc90"></a>The Roundup</h2></div></div><p>The WS is designed to be an &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; web server.
Small ISPs and corporate intranets or web sites are the most likely
candidates for the WS.</p><p>The DM is aimed at the software designer and comes with a
suite of development and programming tools. It is primarily for
Corel NetWinder project developers.</p><p>The LC is seen as a business or enterprise desktop client,
although I also see this as potentially quite attractive to the
home user looking for a robust alternative to running MS Windows.
It comes with X, the KDE windows environment, Netscape Communicator
and WordPerfect 8. Supporting many client/server models, the LC
comes with Sun's Java VM, a Citrix ICA client to access 32-bit MS
Windows applications and good old terminal access.</p><p>For the workgroup environment, Corel offers the GS. Designed
as a local enterprise server, the GS offers e-mail services, HTML
authoring, discussion groups, and document management and indexing
functionality.</p><p>Finally, there's the RM. This NetWinder will appeal to larger
ISPs. Each RM can accommodate two NetWinders in the space of a
single rack unit. That means a possible 80 NetWinders in a standard
rack. Each RM is designed to be hot swappable from its partner. One
from each pair can be removed without powering down the other
unit.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2464580.0x255cef8"></a>First Impressions</h2></div></div><p>I decided to review this unit while leaning toward the WS
model, a more likely choice for ISPs and corporate intranets. When
I got my NetWinder home, I plugged the unit in, hooked up the
included mouse and keyboard and plugged in a 15-inch Digital SVGA
monitor. The NetWinder does not come with a monitor, because in the
case of the WS, Corel imagines the unit running in the background
without being looked at. After all, it <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span>
designed to be a server and can be administered through a web
interface. Personally, I can imagine lots of people wanting one of
these on their desktops.</p><p>After a few seconds, I heard little start-up tones,
&ldquo;Too-loo-toong!&rdquo;, followed by a strange, childlike voice saying,
&ldquo;Welcome to NetWinder&rdquo;. (I later found out that this is one of
the developer's children. The voice is kind of cute.) Next, I
logged in, as per the tiny (not much more than a dozen pages)
user's manual that came with it, as I was anxious to get started. I
completely ignored the part about &ldquo;setting it up for your
network&rdquo;.</p><p>I typed <b  >startx</b> and was greeted by a
bright, beautiful KDE desktop with Corel's logo floating on a black
background. I flipped through the four virtual desktops, each with
a different background. Number three, with its stone wall image as
the background, nearly blew me away; the brilliant definition
begged me to reach out and touch it in order to convince myself it
wasn't real. Corel has put nice video into their NetWinders. This
was actually the first time I had seen the KDE desktop, and I was
so impressed with it that I now run it on my Dell XPi notebook. KDE
is not included on the WS, but I couldn't resist playing with all
the toys on my DM.</p><p>I wandered around the desktop, played a couple of hands of
poker, and finally dragged myself back to writing this review. To
set the machine up for my network, I plugged the 10Mbps port into a
free port on the hub, typed <b  >netconfig</b> and
modified the address to fit in to my 192.168 existing class C.
Then, I used Netscape to access the NetWinder from my Dell notebook
running Red Hat 5.2.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3288f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. So simple, even Natika can use it.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2464580.0x255d3c8"></a>WebFront &amp; Administration</h2></div></div><p>Right away, I was presented with WebFront, Corel's
administrative interface for the WS. It took me awhile to figure
out how to log in to the administration utility. After chasing
through some of the CGI scripts under the /admin directory, I found
a reference to /usr/bin/htpasswd.sh which apparently you must run
at least once in order to get WebFront to realize your admin user
is legit. This script creates the .htpasswd file.</p><p>WebFront is a browser-based tool that makes it possible to
administer your NetWinder through a few simple forms. You can add,
delete or modify users and groups through the interface. The clean,
simple interface also serves up statistics on your NetWinder's
performance in a graphical form, giving you glimpses of your web
site's activity over different time scales.</p><p>To get a feel for its performance, I uploaded a few web sites
that were done in Microsoft FrontPage. The transfer was very fast,
a testament to the NetWinder's zippy little combination of
processor and network architecture. I did a couple of these, one
for our SF magazine <span   class="emphasis"><em>TransVersions</em></span> and another
for a customer's intranet. Both sailed by faster than the &ldquo;time to
go&rdquo; in FrontPage could keep up. What it estimated would take three
plus minutes flew past in less than ten seconds.</p><p>Access to the pages was very fast. I fired up Netscape and as
fast as I could click links, pages appeared in my browser. It was
almost disconcerting. My local Pentium-powered Linux system, which
we use as our corporate gateway/e-mail server/development machine,
seemed to crawl in comparison. I was starting to get a touch of
server envy.</p><p>Corel benchmarks with 16 clients connected to the NetWinder
at 70 requests per second or nearly 350,000 bytes per second. You
can expect as many as 150 concurrent requests per second, depending
on client load.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3288f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

does regularly is set up Internet gateway, e-mail server, firewall,
dial-on-demand combination systems that give customers inexpensive
access to the Internet. We use PPP and masquerading to quickly link
up a small office for transparent access. I decided to try this
with the NetWinder.</p><p>Using the supplied netconfig, I found no option for modifying
the PPP interface, so I created one using the Red Hat
<span   class="bold"><b>netcfg</b></span> utility and tried to
activate it. A message to the console informed me, &ldquo;Sorry&mdash;this
system lacks PPP kernel support&rdquo;. No problem, I thought. I'm a
UNIX guy. I can recompile the kernel with PPP support and be on my
way. It turns out I was mistaken. There is no kernel source on the
system, so PPP is impossible at this time.</p><p>Another thing I found disconcerting was the lack of an
&ldquo;off&rdquo; switch. Call me foolish, call me irresponsible, but I find
the fact that you can't shut down the machine distressing. While I
realize you'll want your network gateway to stay up forever, I'm
used to powering down my system every once in a while. If you want
to shut down the NetWinder, you can use the standard
<span   class="bold"><b>shutdown</b></span> command and wait for the
&ldquo;System halted&rdquo; prompt before disconnecting power by pulling the
power cord. That's right. You disconnect power, rather than turning
it off. Even then, the FAQ from the netwinder.org site says you
should not power down. The NetWinder has no battery for backup of
its system clock. What it does have is a &ldquo;big capacitor&rdquo; that
will hold a charge for about two days&mdash;any longer and you may need
to reset your clock. When I got my NetWinder for evaluation, it had
been off for some time and seemed to think we were already in the
next millennium.</p><p>One other thing I will admit is fairly minor. I find the fan
a bit loud, which is silly since the NetWinder is still quieter
than my usual server. Without the hum of the power supply, the disk
churning away and all the other noises one usually expects from
their computer, the NetWinder's little fan seems, well,
loud&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>bizarre</em></span>.</p><p>A little later, I wrote up a small list of &ldquo;would-be-nices&rdquo;
to pass along to Corel. I'd like some kind of database. The
freeware Postgres would be enough to make me happy. I'd also like
that PPP support, a built-in fax modem <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> the
source code so I could hack my kernel when I felt the need
to.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2464580.0x255dc08"></a>Corel Responds</h2></div></div><p>The next day, I called Corel's tech support engineers and
discussed this. They told me that in early 1999, NetWinder would
have PPP support and should include a V.90 modem for access. This
pleased me very much. Right now, the NetWinder is designed to sit
behind a router with one interface configured for the internal
network and the other (most likely the 10 Mbps interface) hooked up
to the outside world. This makes it a winner with small ISPs and
corporate intranets.</p><p>The Corel engineers have already considered many of these
things. After chatting with them, I was told that future NetWinders
would include full Red Hat distributions which should take care of
most of my software concerns. They have some other cool ideas as
well. Corel intends to offer customized NetWinders using swappable
daughter cards; some would come with ultra-wide SCSI to plug into
RAIDs, others with ISDN. Corel is keeping an open mind.</p><p>The LC was out at the end of 1998. The WS and DM are
available now. Corel is also looking into a TC or thin client. It
would run a core Linux OS and take everything else from the
network. Because it will be essentially diskless (OS on board),
this NetWinder will be completely silent; it wouldn't even need a
fan.</p><p>Ah, yes, the fan&mdash;Corel also thinks the fan is loud and is
currently working with different designs to make things
quieter.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2464580.0x25546a8"></a>Final Impressions</h2></div></div><p>The NetWinder seems like a good bet and I'm going to keep a
close eye on how this product plays out. What you need to do is
decide which NetWinder will suit your needs. In order to satisfy my
current customer's needs, I'd most likely turn to the GS when it
becomes available.</p><p>The NetWinder is small and fast and its power consumption is
minimal. It looks slick. Best of all, NetWinder runs on
Linux.</p></div></div>
