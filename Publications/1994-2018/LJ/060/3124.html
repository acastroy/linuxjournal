    A discussion of the need for certification and a proposal
    from Sair, Inc. for a Linux certificate program.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d3580.0x23cb3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Within the Linux community is a growing
discussion concerning the need for certification. Although
certification may not be appropriate for today's Linux enthusiasts,
it will be essential in the future as Linux software is brought
into corporate and government environments. Certification programs
and open source software will become significant as more and more
independent professional programmers integrate Linux and
Linux-based software into standard contract programming. Use of the
certification process to develop minimal standards that are
acceptable to the Linux community will also smooth the coming
transition to state board licensure of the Professional Software
Engineer.
</p><p>When comparing diverse professions such as law, civil
engineering, accountancy, clinical medicine, clinical psychology,
and even hairdressing, one notices they all have a requirement of
certification or licensure for the practicing professional.
Computer professionals, on the other hand, do not have such a
requirement.</p><p>The main reason for the lack of required credentials is
probably that the computer discipline is only about twenty-five
years old and, therefore, it has yet to come of age in industry or
academia. As evidence of this field's youthfulness, traditional
engineers often dismiss computer science as pseudo-engineering.
Programmers stress the art (as opposed to science) of programming
and the art of system administration. Computer science degree
programs have been placed in university liberal arts, business or
engineering schools. Meanwhile, computer scientists themselves
cannot agree on even a short list of essential degree requirements
for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS).</p><p>In spite of this awkwardness and uncertainty, our profession
is doing well. BSCS graduates command high initial salaries that
match or exceed other engineering disciplines. Computers control
much of the country's infrastructure and this control is
dramatically demonstrated by the manpower and resources currently
employed to address the year 2000 problem.</p><p>In other words, the debate over certification in general and
Linux certification in particular represents the growing pains of a
relatively new profession and society's need to understand what a
software engineer does. To make matters worse, the U.S. Department
of Labor predicts that the computer industry will have 300,000 more
programmer positions than programmers over the next few years and
universities will not be able to fill the predicted demand. In
fact, overall enrollment in computer science programs has decreased
slightly in the last year (see
http://stats.bls.gov/oco/ocos110.htm).</p><p>The role of certification, therefore, is to provide a method
by which employers can specify and expect a given level of computer
system expertise from employees without requiring them to have an
advanced computer science degree. In a secondary role,
certification acts as a supplement to a college or university
degree by providing professional development through continuing
education.</p><p>It is now time for the Linux community to shape the future of
the software engineering profession by agreeing upon minimal
industry requirements that will be codified into certification and
licensure requirements.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d3580.0x23cb6b8"></a>Why a Linux Certificate?</h2></div></div><p>A Linux system and its array of development tools and
applications represent a central core (or &ldquo;common body&rdquo;) of
knowledge for today's professional software engineer. Linux
&ldquo;empowers&rdquo; the software professional with a set of tools that
allows one individual to quickly provide sophisticated, flexible
and reliable system solutions on a variety of computing platforms.
These sophisticated solutions would otherwise require teams of
programmers working months to integrate proprietary and
incompatible software modules.</p><p>Second, a fundamental concern of corporate and government
managers is the cost of operations&mdash;and Linux dramatically reduces
this cost. The reduction is not so much from the idea of free
software, but more a result of increased programmer productivity
through complete control over the system. Another aspect of reduced
cost is that the entire Linux community, including business and
government, is continually debugging and improving the program
base, making the system even more cost effective with each new
distribution.</p><p>A third reason for a Linux certificate comes from state
licensing boards. Licensing is a governmental action that seeks to
safeguard the health, safety, welfare and property of its citizens
and businesses through regulation of the offer of services, review
of performance and use of the title &ldquo;Engineer&rdquo;.</p><p>On February 18, 1998, the Texas Board of Professional
Engineers stated its intention to recognize software engineering as
a legitimate sub-discipline. On June 17, 1998, the Texas Board
approved a license for the Professional Software Engineer, and on
August 3, 1998, began licensing software engineers through a waiver
process (http://www.main.org/peboard/).</p><p>Given how Linux is used, this is a significant move by the
Texas Board of Professional Engineers. Linux system software allows
the independent software professional to provide a competitive bid,
program the application and deliver a software product quickly. The
professional programmer knows that Linux is a complete and open
source software system that will simplify the solution of any
development problem. In other words, from embedded systems through
advanced networked clusters, Linux has already handled many
programming and integration issues. The software developer is free
to configure Linux in any way that best suits the required
solution. Hence, Linux is an integral part of the software
engineering process and as State Board licensure continues to grow,
Linux must be a part of the licensing process.</p><p>Finally, given the predicted demand for software
professionals, a Linux certificate will provide a valuable aid to
employers in discovering productive software professionals.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d3580.0x23cb978"></a>The Certification Process</h2></div></div><p>Certification is an assessment of an individual's knowledge
and skills in a given area of expertise. Currently, more than 170
certificates are offered and many of these have overlapping areas
of expertise. These certificates are generally centered around a
vendor's hardware or software product.</p><p>The certificate provider typically defines core knowledge and
develops texts, study guides and other course material that cover
the defined expertise. Students enroll in the certificate program
and purchase the appropriate texts and study guides. Supporting
materials such as video and/or audio tape lectures are sometimes
offered for an additional fee.</p><p>Core knowledge is usually divided into four to six areas,
with separate tests for each area. The goal of such test taking is
not to compare one person's test performance to another's, but to
determine whether an individual meets or exceeds the minimal
requirements of the vendor training program. A typical student
(given family and job obligations) takes the tests over a six- to
twelve-month period.</p><p>Once the candidate earns a passing grade on all of the
required tests, a certificate is issued authorizing the software
professional to list the certificate with their name. The
certificate provider usually offers &ldquo;perks&rdquo; that include a
technical hot line or exclusive forum with other certificate
holders, a WWW database listing of member skills and services,
plaques, photo ID badges and logos for business cards and
letterheads. The cost of obtaining these certificates can range
from $2,000 to $10,000 US.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d3580.0x23cbb88"></a>Key Certification Benefits</h2></div></div><p>Certificates assure employers that the holder has a specific
set of skills and a minimal level of competence. Company
management, in turn, exploits certification by advertising the
employee's skills to their customers and billing customers more per
hour than for non-certified employees.</p><p>Certification typically gives an employee more job options
and yields better pay. Certification in a high-demand area can lead
to a wage increase of $5 to $10 US per hour (that's $10,000 to
$20,000 US per year) over non-certified computer
professionals.</p><p>Many corporate managers consider certification an investment
in human resources and, as a result, they pay for or otherwise
assist with certification costs. The consensus among managers is
that certification leads to improved employee service, reduced
problem-solving time, easier assimilation of new technology and
higher overall employee productivity.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d3580.0x23cbd40"></a>It Is Time for Linux Certification</h2></div></div><p>Several issues have come together that indicate it is time
for us to offer a Linux community-based certificate. First, there
is a clear consensus among the Linux community that Linux should
continue to grow, receive wide acceptance among programmers and
should offer an alternative to traditional software products.
However, the growth of Linux functionality and acceptance is not a
simple straight line on a graph. Over the last two years and
especially within the last year, Linux distributions have reached a
&ldquo;critical mass&rdquo; of stability, reliability and completeness that
will accelerate the growth of Linux over the next few years.
Second, the expected rapid growth of Linux will create a need for
business and government managers to have an additional metric in
the selection of new employees as well as an additional metric for
employee merit pay increase and employee promotions. Third, as
other State Boards of Professional Engineers see what has been
established in the State of Texas, it will be only a matter of time
before licensing software engineers is common. Consequently, a
Linux certificate will act as a conduit to build a community
consensus on certification and licensing.</p><p>Hence, now is the time for a Linux certificate and it is
Sair, Inc.'s intention to act as a conduit for the Linux
certificate by describing our certification process in detail,
soliciting critical analysis, debating the specifics and creating a
Board of Advisors. The Board of Advisors will consist of respected
Linux community members given the responsibility of ensuring that
the certificate meets minimal community standards and covers
material representative of how Linux is used in business,
government and independent programmer shops. Furthermore, the Board
will recommend actions to advance Linux in the computer
industry.</p><p>A component of this advancement will be combining the
accumulated certificate knowledge with activism to ensure that the
Linux community is represented at the State Board licensing
level.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d3580.0x23cbef8"></a>The Linux Certificate</h2></div></div><p>The proposed Linux certificate will cover four areas:
installation, networking, shells and commands, and security. In the
future, and depending on the directions Linux takes in business, a
Linux kernel certificate that covers the details of kernel
development, maintenance and embedded systems will be considered.
There will be tests for each of the four areas and candidates can
take them one at a time or in clusters. Hands-on demonstrations may
be an essential component of some tests.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d3580.0x23cc000"></a>Examination Topics</h2></div></div><p>A working draft of a comprehensive outline of the proposed
certificate material is at http://www.linuxcertification.org/.
Although the outline may be missing a given topic or detail, a
surprising amount of information must still be covered. Given the
large amount of Linux system information that exists, we have yet
to define the exact breadth versus depth of the exam. For example,
it is assumed in the study guides that the student already
understands basic operating system concepts such as memory and
process management, interprocess communication, file management,
device drivers, system abstractions, network layers and so on. A
separate section devoted to these concepts may have to be developed
in the future.</p><p>Candidates will need additional background study material to
support the &ldquo;narrow&rdquo; study guides. Currently, we are employing
existing Linux texts to provide background and related details for
the Linux certificate topics. In the future, we will integrate
other on-line documents into the study guide through either cross
reference or additional independent study guides. This means that,
at least initially, the Linux student will require a larger
textbook library than that required for other certificates. (See
the web site for a suggested reading list of background
texts.)</p><p>Existing study guides (with background text references) are
being refined and more are being developed. They can be reached
from the &ldquo;study guide&rdquo; hyperlinks in the working draft outline,
for example at http://www.linuxcertification.org/introqa.html.
These guides are in the form of essay questions followed by
answers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d3580.0x23cc1b8"></a>Exam Administration</h2></div></div><p>Members of the Linux community would clearly like to take
certification exams on the Web. (See
http://www.linuxjournal.com/HyperNews/get/certification.html.)
Unfortunately, no straightforward method exists for user validation
(fraud prevention) over the Web. Assuming the Linux certification
process becomes a self-sustaining enterprise, we will be developing
fraud-proof technology for web-based exams. Until that time, we
will use traditional testing methods and environments. Initial
tests will be based upon &ldquo;book knowledge&rdquo;, while advanced tests
may include hands-on demonstrations. Assuming enough interest, book
knowledge tests can be given in commercial testing centers such as
Sylvan Prometric. Testing on advanced material and hands-on
demonstrations will be made available as the need arises.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d3580.0x23cc2c0"></a>Milestones for the Linux Certificate</h2></div></div><p>These items need to be completed:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Solicit community comments. (Initial outline at
http://www.linuxcertification.org/.)</p></li><li><p>Complete development of study guides, using
selected background texts and on-line material as reference.
(Initial study guides are hyperlinked at
http://www.linuxcertification.org/.)</p></li><li><p>Use community comments and Board recommendations to
improve study guides.</p></li><li><p>Upon completion of the first study guide, accept
candidates for the certificate.</p></li><li><p>Based upon interest, schedule tests while study
guides for each area are developed.</p></li><li><p>Upon completion of all study guides, schedule final
tests and begin awarding certificates.</p></li><li><p>Begin active consulting with State Boards
concerning Linux and its relationship to licensing.</p></li><li><p>Develop continuing education credits and
courses.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d3580.0x23cc9a0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>In planning for the future, we are developing a Linux
Certificate now. We want the certificate to be truly representative
of the Linux community, and your comments are essential in helping
us achieve that representation. We believe certification has
significant mutual benefits for employers and employees and will
become a key tool for managers as Linux software is brought into
corporate and government environments.</p><p>As more and more independent professional programmers
integrate Linux software into their standard contract programming,
we will be promoting Linux as core knowledge in the State Board of
Professional Engineers licensure process.</p><p><a href="3124s2.html" target="_self">Resources</a>
