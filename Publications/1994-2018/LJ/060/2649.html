    A look at one man's experiences setting up Linux as an
    application and boot server for Neoware network computers.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x249d580.0x2595500"></a></h2></div></div><p>For over three years, the computer
industry has been touting the benefits of network computers,
including higher reliability, lower cost of ownership and simpler
administration. Yet despite this, few people have seen a network
computer. Even fewer have configured, installed and supported them.
</p><p>The premise behind network computers is increasing both
reliability and manageability. The former is done by removing
components with high failure rates, such as the hard drive and
fans; the latter is improved by centralizing applications on
servers. A standard proposed to the Open Group embodies these
principles in the &ldquo;NC1 Reference Profile&rdquo;. The hardware
specifications require only a keyboard, pointing device, network
adapter, audio, 8MB RAM and 640x480 resolution. The PC industry
proposed the &ldquo;NetPC&rdquo; standard which further requires an X86 style
processor, hard drive and plug-and-play compatibility.</p><p>The NC1 standard is followed by Neoware's line of network
computers. In addition, Neoware added a Java virtual machine,
support for PCMCIA cards, higher video resolutions and more memory.
Also supported is a wide variety of network protocols, making
integration into existing networks fairly easy. For this, Neoware
is consistently rated among the top of the NC manufacturers and is
also the reason we chose to work with them.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2649f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. A Look Inside

</p></div></div><p>The company I work for is Unique Systems, Inc., based in
Toledo, Ohio. We have a large customer base throughout the Midwest.
Our primary focus is custom programming and support for an
accounting and job cost system. In addition, we are often asked to
perform system administration for our clients. As a result,
simplicity and remote administration are essential. We do not have
the time or the staff for long-term on-site maintenance. NCs are a
perfect fit.</p><p>Before I get into configuring and using an NC with Linux, let
me describe the basic functionality of a Neoware NC, in particular
NeoStation 200. When the NC is first turned on, it establishes a
TCP/IP network connection and obtains its IP address via BOOTP,
DHCP or from a value stored in flash memory. Next, it downloads its
operating system (Neoware uses netOS) from a boot server and
initializes it. The user is then presented with a graphical login
screen similar to XDM. It has the ability to authenticate against
any host on the network. After logging in, a window manager is
started. The default is
<span   class="bold"><b>netoswm</b></span>&mdash;similar to FVWM95. Open
Look and Motif window managers are also available. All the window
managers are capable of running remote X applications or Windows
applications using ICA. Many applications can be downloaded and
executed out of RAM as needed; others can be run remotely using
either X or ICA (Independant Computing Architecture) thin-client
desktops.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2649f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. A Windows ICA Session, Remote Character Application and a
Netscape Window

</p></div></div><p>Many of our clients need to do only basic office tasks:
access to the accounting system (which we can provide via a
terminal session or a Java applet front end), e-mail and an office
suite. An NC is a good match for these applications. Terminal
emulation is provided by the TeemNC application. E-mail can be done
with Navio's Netscape Navigator 3.0 for netOS. For an office suite,
we install Applixware on a Linux server and execute it remotely
from the NC (this is much faster than you might think).</p><p>What else do you need beside a Linux server to make it work?
The short answer is&mdash;nothing. In practice, however, a few things
need to be done on other platforms. In particular, I have had
difficulty getting the daemon
<span   class="bold"><b>in.timed</b></span> to work properly to
provide time services, and several commercial applications have not
yet been ported to Linux.</p><p>Let's start from the beginning with how the netOS gets loaded
onto the NC and what part Linux plays in the process. When a
NeoStation is turned on, it gives the option of entering a
configuration screen; all the network configuration can be done
from here. The IP addresses of the DNS server, gateway and boot
host (all Linux machines) can be supplied, as well as the address
of the NC itself. The location (directory) on the boot host where
the netOS operating system resides also needs to be supplied. The
access method can be either NFS, FTP or TFTP, with NFS being the
preferred method. Once the NC is configured and restarted, it
searches the network for the specified boot host, attaches to it
using the chosen protocol and downloads its OS.</p><p>Neoware supplies netOS on a CD with an installation shell
script. This script ensures the license key is valid, prompts for
the installation directory and copies files off the CD into that
directory.</p><p>Configuration of the boot host is a little more complicated.
NFS needs to be configured if it is to be used as the access
method. Usually this involves editing the /etc/exports file and
adding an entry for the netOS installation directory. You might
also want to make sure NFS starts up on boot. We usually configure
the boot host to run domain name services and
<span   class="bold"><b>sendmail</b></span> for the network, just
because Linux is so good at it.</p><p>Now, assuming all this is in place and running, the NC should
boot up and present the user with a login screen. Any host can be
used to authenticate against, but it is easiest to supply it with a
user account on the Linux boot host. After logging in, the NC looks
for a window manager configuration to run. It defaults to a
system-wide configuration on the boot host if it can't find a
custom one in the user's home directory.</p><p>Any applets/applications installed with the netOS are part of
the default window manager configuration. These include Netscape
Navigator 3.0 and miscellaneous utilities such as a calculator. You
can run them by navigating through a menu tree similar to the
infamous &ldquo;Start&rdquo; button, or through a floating button bar on the
desktop. Unfortunately, adding anything requires knowledge of how
to edit a window manager configuration file. The saving grace is
that the format is similar to many &ldquo;standard&rdquo; UNIX configuration
files. One of the first things I do is edit this file to remove the
button for the &ldquo;Setup&rdquo; utility and add buttons for Applixware and
TELNET access to remote hosts.</p><p>Neoware ships an ICA client with netOS that allows you to run
Windows applications alongside X, Java and character applications.
If you need to run Windows applications, you can set up an NT
Terminal Server with Citrix's MetaFrame for Terminals (which is
significantly less expensive than other MetaFrame products). The
client can be started through the root window menus. In the
screenshots (see Figures 2, 3 and 4), you can see all of these
running alongside each other. Interestingly, when that screenshot
was taken, only half of the system memory was being used&mdash;16MB were
free.</p><p>Working with netOS is not very difficult. The console window
on an NC offers several UNIX-like commands that can be used to show
the current hardware configuration, connect to remote machines
(such as by TELNET and FTP) and browse the file system. The file
system is similar to an NFS file system: most of the files reside
on a remote computer, but the local ROM can also be examined. Very
few configuration files on the server ever need to be edited and
almost all of them lie in the same directory. Devices can be
accessed, similar to UNIX. You can access the parallel port through
/dev/pp0, for example.</p><p>Is it that easy? Yes, provided you have a good understanding
of configuring NFS and adding hosts to the network. Almost all the
problems encountered when setting up a boot host are associated
with NFS permission problems on the part of the NC. A boot log is
generated on the NC that can be viewed to troubleshoot problems.
Setting up the first NC on the network is the hardest part, because
of all the configuration that has to be done on the server. After
that, getting other NCs up and running applications on the network
happens about as fast as you can unbox them. In fact, it is not an
exaggeration to say it takes longer to open up the boxes than it
does to configure the NC.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2649f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Windows with Different Emulations

Figure 4. A Few X Applications, Applixware and Netscape

</p></div></div><p>With the amount of X and character-based applications
available, why haven't NCs caught on? The most obvious reason is
the drop in price of PCs. Before 1995, it was next to impossible to
find a PC for less than $1000 US; now, nearly every computer
manufacturer offers a few to choose from. Another reason is the
lack of Java applications that were promised. NCs were supposed to
be the ideal platform to run all the Java applications that have
yet to appear. For better or for worse, the industry leaders in the
NC market are not the industry leaders in the PC market.</p><p>All that aside, network computers are still the ideal
platform for many people who use computers. Anyone using a terminal
to access a character-based application on a server can benefit
enormously by the ability to have multiple windows open and
viewable simultaneously on an NC. The learning curve on an NC can
be tailored to fit individual users by changing the complexity of
the desktop. For curious users or those unfamiliar with computers,
it is next to impossible for them to accidentally render an NC
unusable. Network computers and Linux servers make a powerful
combination.</p></div></div>
