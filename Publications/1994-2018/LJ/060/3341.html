have O'Reilly's book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning Linux</em></span>, which is
a good reference. The only problem I have is that I cannot access
/dev/fd0. When I type this command in an xterm, a message states
that access to the device is forbidden. What am I supposed to do? I
have looked up information on the Linux USENET listing, but I
cannot find anything specific. &mdash;P. Kincaid,
pkincaid@osf1.gmu.edu</p><p>You either need to be root to access /dev/fd0 or belong to a
group (e.g., floppy) to which users with access permissions to
/dev/fd0 belong. On my system, it looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

not configured. A good way to get started is to run xf86config.
This program will step you through several questions and then set
up a simple XF86Config file that should get you up and running
quickly. Once you get X running you can make any other changes you
might need. &mdash;Chad Robinson, chadr@brt.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d23580.0x1e1b710"></a>Upgrading an Old Kernel</h2></div></div><p>I want to upgrade my kernel. The one I am currently using is
a few years old. Can I upgrade all the way to 2.0 or 2.1? One of
the things I need in a new kernel is support for the CMD 640 chip.
Right now, Linux can see only one of my hard drives. I am also
looking for something that will play audio CDs from my NEC 260 2X
CD-ROM. A few more specifics: I downloaded kernel 2.0.33 (I think).
It has the support for the CMD chip. I can get all the way through
<b  >make config</b>, but then I get errors when trying
to compile the kernel. It tells me I need gcc 2.6.3 or above. I got
2.7.2 from an FTP site and installed it along with the current
libraries. However, now when I type <b  >gcc</b>, it says
it cannot execute the binary file. What's up? &mdash;Jim Coonradt,
coonmanx@yahoo.com</p><p>A lot has changed since your system was brought up. Linux
went through three binary formats (a.out, elf/libc5 and elf/libc6
aka glibc). There is a lot to fix and upgrade on your system to get
a recent kernel to compile and run properly. If you are interested
in doing so, you can look at /usr/src/linux/Documentation/Changes/
on a recent kernel, and learn about the three binary formats, but
be prepared to do a lot of reading. A much easier alternative is to
back up your user data, and install a brand new Linux distribution.
If you are interested in running 2.1 and the upcoming 2.2 kernels,
you should consider installing Red Hat 5.2, Debian 2.0 or higher,
or SuSE 5.3. &mdash;Marc Merlin, marc@merlins.org</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d23580.0x1e1b920"></a>Wrong Date</h2></div></div><p>The date on my Linux box is not correct. My time is GMT+5. I

myself and use <span   class="bold"><b>su</b></span> to become root
using the root password. What's up? &mdash;Scott Hall,
shall@ccae.org</p><p>The file called /etc/securetty defines the terminals a root
user may log in to. Make sure ttyp0, ttyp1 and so forth are defined
in that file. Each TELNET session uses one of these terminals, so
define several. If you don't and normal users are logged in on p0
and p1, you will not be able to log in as root on p2. &mdash;Chad
Robinson, chadr@brt.com</p><p>TELNET is set up to deny root access as a deliberate security
measure. This keeps a cracker from compromising the root account
directly&mdash;he has to first compromise a user account, thereby making
it twice as hard to become root on your Linux box.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Incidentally, the potential cracker's job is made
even harder by not indicating that</em></span> no password will work
for root when logging in remotely. The cracker can't tell whether
his login attempt is failing because he has the wrong password, or
because remote root logins are entirely disabled. &mdash;Scott Maxwell,

questions:</p><p>How can I tell if I have a.out binaries on my system? Any
mention of these suggest them to be an old format. Is there
anything still around that I'm likely to be using that requires
a.out support in the kernel?</p><p>Also, how can I tell which shell(s) I need on my system? It
seems several get installed, but I'd be happy to stick to just one.
Do I need to scan for scripts that may use something other than the
default shell? If so, could someone suggest an appropriate scan
script to demonstrate &ldquo;The Power&rdquo; to a newbie, please?</p><p>Perhaps the savings are modest for each of these, but so are
  the resources for my foray into the Linux world! &mdash;Barry Johnson,
barryjj@ibm.net</p><p>To search for a.out binaries, type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
find / -mode +400 -exec file {}\; | grep MAGIC
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The <b>find</b> command looks for files
with the executable bit set. <b>file</b> prints what
they are and <b>grep</b> extracts a.out files
(identified as either ZMAGIC or NMAGIC or similar strings. System
scripts use only /bin/sh (no csh, zsh or other shell). On the other
hand, some scripts may be written in other languages, and their
interpreter is sometimes called shell. These dependencies, however,
are managed by your packaging system. If you are curious, repeat

prints the shell and file name of all executable shell scripts on
your system. Run it as root. The shells are printed first so that
you can pipe the script's output through
<span   class="bold"><b>sort</b></span> to sort the results by shell;
this helps you quickly skip past the shells you decide to keep. It
will take some time to run and probably will produce a great deal
of output, so you should redirect the output to a file. &mdash;Scott

down some information. Maybe you can help me out or point me in the
right direction.</p><p>1. I have Red Hat 5.2, Netscape 4.5 and cable internet
access. My FTP throughput is excellent, but general browsing on the
Internet is almost unbearable. My 9.6 modem could be faster (well,
almost). It's kind of disappointing, compared to my NT system.
Anyway, my first question: I hear regular disk activity, every five
seconds or so. It's like some kind of paging is going on. What do
you think is going on in the background? If I leave the PC alone
for 15-20 seconds, it quiets down.</p><p>2. My second question is: while a web page is loading, I can
start up <span   class="bold"><b>top</b></span> in an xterm window,
move the window around and actually get faster downloads. I can't
explain it. I can be sitting with a partially loaded page for 30
seconds, then bring up top and it's like Linux woke up and started
updating the screen. &mdash;Daryle Dianis, ddianis@home.com</p><p>1. I take it this disk activity isn't linked to a
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> job, but indeed to paging. A
good way to make sure is to install and run
<span   class="bold"><b>procmeter</b></span>; it can show you all
kinds of activity meters, including disk activity and
paging.</p><p>2. You don't give any details about your hardware, but it
sounds like some kind of hardware and/or driver problem. Make sure
you are running the latest version of X (3.3.3.1), and you don't
have any interrupt conflicts. For example, you may have an
interrupt configured for your video card (you don't need one) that
conflicts with the interrupt of your network card. You can also try
changing the interrupt of your network card. &mdash;Marc Merlin,
marc@merlins.org</p><p>This may be a long shot, but do you have power management
turned on? If your hard drive is spinning up and down, it might be
producing this type of problem. Anything that represents more
frequent activity (like top) that kept your drive from spinning
down (or your CPU from slowing, etc.) would seem to speed up your
computer.</p><p>An interesting thing to try would be to go into your BIOS at
boot time and turn off all of your power management features. If
that turns out to be helpful, you can turn it back on one feature
at a time until you isolate the issue. &mdash;Chad Robinson,
chadr@brt.com</p></div></div>
