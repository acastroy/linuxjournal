    The world-class research center at Purdue University is
    getting serious about cutting edge development of security
    related projects.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x242b580.0x25233f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Keeping the bandits out is not the only
reason you will need educated security experts to maintain your
system in the future. What will happen when the demand for security
administrators is so high your firm cannot afford them? Or if the
total development cost for secure software is more than the debt in
the U.S. alone? Your answer to my last question may be, &ldquo;We will
use open-source code&rdquo;--good point! However, you will still need
experienced security personnel to maintain your system.
</p><p>As most of the industry is struggling to prepare their
systems for the year 2000, academia is facing the problem of
educating enough computer scientists. Government reports predict
that in the year 2000, on-line commerce in the U.S. alone will
exceed 15 billion dollars per year, and the sales of security
software will exceed two billion dollars per year. The need for
increased training and research in information security will only
expand in the coming years as the use of wide-area computer
networks spreads.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x242b580.0x2523558"></a>Fighting Information Warfare with
Education</h2></div></div><p>As computer crime is increasing, Purdue University in Indiana
is addressing the issue. For the last seven years, the Purdue
Computer Science Department has been the home of the Computer
Operations, Audit and Security Technology (COAST) laboratory. COAST
is one of the largest academic research groups and graduate studies
laboratories in practical computer and network security in the
world. The laboratory is expanding into a newly established
center.</p><p>Purdue's University Center for Education and Research in
Information Assurance and Security (CERIAS as in &ldquo;serious&rdquo;) is a
pioneer in the area of information security. This new university
center was designed to educate the next generation of computer and
network security specialists. With projects encompassing Linux,
Solaris, Windows 95/NT, smart cards, iButtons, biometrics, ATM
networks and firewalls, their research will work toward the goal of
reducing the threat of so-called information warfare.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x242b580.0x25236b8"></a>One of a Kind</h2></div></div><p>The director of the laboratory and of the newly founded
center, Professor Gene Spafford, is a computer scientist who has
been a major contributor to the discipline of information security.
Spafford is an ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) fellow and
has written several books on information security. He also helped
to analyze and contain the Internet worm in 1998. Together with 15
faculty members and 40 graduate and undergraduate students (see
Figure 1), he is steering the center toward a common goal: to
provide world-class research and education in information
security.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3175f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Professors, staff and students in the COAST/CERIAS
facility at Purdue University
</p></div></div><p>Currently, the faculty and students are drawn heavily from
the computer science area. However, the center is opening its doors
to a diversity of disciplines (e.g., philosophy, linguistics,
political science, industrial engineering, management, sociology
and electrical and computer engineering).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3175f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Graduate Student COAST Laboratory
</p></div></div><p>The laboratory (see Figure 2) and the new center have
attracted professors and students from 13 countries. One reason is
that there are few highly competent academic security laboratories
with industry support. The diversity does not end with
nationality&mdash;almost 40 percent of the students are female. Security
has drawn the interest of women since the early days, and the
number of female students has been increasing steadily in the last
few years.</p><p>The research includes audit trails format and reduction,
network protection, firewall and software evaluation, creation of a
vulnerabilities database and testing. Additionally, several
undergraduate projects dealing with authentication and security
archive are in progress. The main COAST projects are described
briefly below.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x242b580.0x2523c38"></a>A Different Approach to Intrusion
Detection</h2></div></div><p>Intrusion Detection (ID) is a field within computer security
that has grown rapidly over the last few years. The AAFID
(autonomous agents for intrusion detection) project in the COAST
laboratory is about intrusion detection.</p><p>Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) collect data
from one or more hosts and process the data in a central machine to
detect anomalous behavior. This approach has a problem in that it
prevents scaling of the IDS to a large number of machines, due to
the storage and processing limitations of the host that performs
the analysis.</p><p>The AAFID architecture uses many independent entities, called
&ldquo;autonomous agents&rdquo;, working simultaneously to perform
distributed intrusion detection. Each agent monitors certain
aspects of a system and reports strange behavior or occurrences of
specific events. For example, one agent may look for bad
permissions on system files, another agent may look for bad
configurations of an FTP server, and yet another may look for
attempts to perform attacks by corrupting the ARP (address
resolution protocol) cache of the machine.</p><p>The results produced by the agents are collected on a
per-machine level, permitting the correlation of events reported by
different agents that may be caused by the same attack.
Furthermore, reports produced by each machine are aggregated at a
higher (per-network) level, allowing the system to detect attacks
involving multiple machines.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3175f4.large.jpg"><img src="3175f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The Agent Window of the AAFID Prototype
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3175f5.large.jpg"><img src="3175f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The Main Window of the AAFID Prototype
</p></div></div><p>The AAFID group consists of ten graduate and undergraduate
students within the COAST laboratory. A prototype implementation
(see Figures 3 and 4) can be found on the AAFID project web page at
http://www.cs.purdue.edu/coast/projects/autonomous-agents.html.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x242b580.0x2524210"></a>Security Archive</h2></div></div><p>During the past several years, students at Purdue have been
maintaining the Internet's largest on-line archive of
security-related tools, papers, standards, advisories and other
materials. The main problem they face is the efficient management
of such highly dynamic information. The group will mirror
constantly changing sites and will maintain the most recent copies
of those sites. Additionally, new sites are continually starting
up&mdash;new papers, new tools and more information that must be added
to the archive.</p><p>The other major concern is being able to find what they are
looking for in the archive. With so much information, it is
difficult to navigate through all the data. The Archive group has
used a combination of Red Hat Linux 5.2 and the open source ROADS
(see Resources) document ordering system to build the prototype.
This will transform the FTP-based archive to an HTTP-based
information system, allowing users to search based on different
criteria or enter a Yahoo-like browsing mode. The group always
welcomes contributions and suggestions
(security-archives@cs.purdue.edu).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x242b580.0x2524370"></a>Tripwire</h2></div></div><p>One of COAST's better-known projects is Tripwire. It was
primarily a project of Gene Kim and Professor Gene Spafford. The
product is now used worldwide and is the most widely deployed
intrusion detection security tool. Tripwire is an integrity
monitoring tool for Linux and other UNIX systems. It uses message
digest algorithms to detect tampering with file contents that might
have been caused by an intruder or virus. In December 1997, Visual
Computing Corporation obtained an exclusive license from Purdue
University to develop and market new versions of the product.
Tripwire IDS 1.3 has been released for Linux. For more information,
see the web site http://www.tripwiresecurity.com/.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x242b580.0x2524478"></a>Underfire</h2></div></div><p>The Underfire team consists of seven graduate and
undergraduate students. Their goals are to gain direct experience
in the installation, evaluation, configuration and usage of
different firewall systems; to investigate new technologies for
network perimeter defenses, including next-generation networks such
as ATM; and to investigate the integration of host- and
network-based security mechanisms with network perimeter defenses.
Underfire is an ongoing project which began in 1997.</p><p>The Underfire team's main goal is to create an architecture
for automated firewall testing. The final product will be an engine
that will test a firewall without human interaction. This will be
achieved with a modular system: the engine, a packet sniffer and
scripted attacks. The engine executes the attacks and uses the
packet sniffer, or other networking protocols, to test the success
or failure of the attack. Finally, a report can be automatically
generated that explains the weak points of the firewall based on
the attack data.</p><p>Having finished the design and initial implementation of the
engine, the Underfire team is currently scripting known attacks.
The automatic report generator is something that will also need to
be completed in the future. Until now, Underfire has taken only
protocol level attacks into account; a future step will be to
extend the tests to the application level such as RPC and
X11.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x242b580.0x2524630"></a>Next Generation Authentication</h2></div></div><p>The need to change the old-fashioned login name and password
procedure of authentication is an obvious place to base research
for the laboratory. By using biometrics devices and tokens such as
smart cards and iButtons, several research and application
development projects can be conducted in this area. Security tokens
under Linux will provide a wide array of security features for the
multiuser operating system.</p><p>One of the COAST students heads the MUSCLE project (Movement
for the Use of Smart Cards in a Linux Environment), one way to
integrate security tokens into the Linux environment. MUSCLE
focuses on smart card and biometrics security under Linux and
consists of several projects. The first is standardizing on a
PC/SC-compliant smart card resource manager written in C++, along
with cryptographic libraries based on the Public-Key Cryptography
Standards (PKCS-11 and PKCS-15). The resource manager also allows
secure remote authentication by using secure channels to
communicate between multiple resource managers. The resource
manager will be used to develop many applications, including secure
login, ssh, xlock, FTP, TELNET, et al., via pluggable
authentication modules (PAM) along with smart card security.</p><p>MUSCLE supports a wide array of smart card readers along with
ISO-7816-4-compliant smart cards. On the web site, you can find
many different smart card specifications, source code for different
projects, on-line tutorials and a mailing list. MUSCLE can be found
at http://www.linuxnet.com/.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x242b580.0x25247e8"></a>Enhancing the Linux Audit Trail</h2></div></div><p>COAST graduate students have been studying ways of enhancing
audit trails on Linux systems. Additionally, penetration and
vulnerability analysis efforts have benefited from the use of Linux
machines with the enhanced auditing systems.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3175f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Network Auditing Trail
</p></div></div><p>Generally, operating systems' audit trails or logs are
inadequate for a variety of applications such as intrusion
detection. The students have developed two different approaches to
enhancing the data collected by Linux. One approach was to use the
technique of interposing shared objects to collect new
application-level audit data. Using this technique, a program can
be instructed to record and act upon certain library calls and
their arguments without modifying the binary or source code of the
program. (See Figure 6.)</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3175f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Snapshot of the Kernel Code
</p></div></div><p>Another part of the project involves using a Linux 2.0.34
kernel (see Figure 7.) to audit low-level network data. This
involves adding a mechanism to the kernel to report network packet
headers to user processes. By correlating these data and intrusion
detection systems, host-based intrusion detection systems can
detect low-level network attacks such as &ldquo;Land&rdquo;, &ldquo;Teardrop&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Syn floods&rdquo;. This mechanism uses a version of the existing
kernel log code, modified to accommodate arbitrary binary
data.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x242b580.0x251b5a0"></a>Vulnerabilities Database and Testing</h2></div></div><p>The vulnerability database and analysis group at COAST is
collecting and analyzing computer vulnerabilities for a variety of
purposes. The project includes the application of knowledge
discovery and data mining tools to find non-obvious relationships
in vulnerability data, to develop vulnerability classifications and
to develop tools that will generate intrusion detection signatures
from vulnerability information. One goal of the group is to develop
methods of testing software in order to discover security flaws
before the software is deployed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x242b580.0x251b6a8"></a>Future</h2></div></div><p>In the words of Professor Spafford:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>With the increasing use of computers and
networks, the importance of information security and assurance is
also going to increase. Concerns for privacy, safety and integrity
may soon become more important to people than speed of computation.
This represents a tremendous challenge, but also a tremendous
opportunity for those who seek to understand&mdash;and provide&mdash;workable
security.</p></blockquote></div><p><a href="3175s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a>
