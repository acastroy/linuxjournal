    My goal was to have <i  >Linux Journal</i> address as many of the needs of the community as possible.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b4580.0x29ac240"></a></h2></div></div><p>In 1993, before I began publishing
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, I knew that in order to succeed
the magazine would need the support of the Linux community. At that
time, most of the community existed on the Internet&mdash;not
surprising, since Linux development was primarily on the Internet
and most developers had met only over the Internet.
</p><p>To test the waters, I posted a questionnaire to the
comp.os.linux newsgroup on Usenet. I had two goals: to find out how
much interest existed for a print publication and what information
was needed. Interest was high; I received very positive feedback.
My goal was to have <i  >Linux Journal</i> address as
many of the needs of the community as possible.</p><p>The first need was to help newcomers join the Linux
community. Many were not familiar with Usenet or didn't have access
to it. These newcomers needed an accessible source of information
in a convenient format&mdash;a print magazine addressed that
market.</p><p>Introducing businesses to Linux was another area that had to
be addressed. While our very existence was a help&mdash;many people have
told us they managed to get Linux integrated into their business by
showing their boss a copy of <i  >LJ</i> to prove Linux
was real&mdash;we wanted to be more active. We started our &ldquo;Linux Means
Business&rdquo; column to show <i  >LJ</i> readers where
Linux was being used as a business solution.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b4580.0x29ac5b0"></a>The Community Evolves</h2></div></div><p>Today, the Linux community is quite different from what it
was five or six years ago. A strong development community still
exists, but the business and commercial user community is now a
significant portion of the total Linux community and growing
rapidly. Linux is no longer a development project&mdash;it is a real
solution for a significant number of enterprises.</p><p>The Jay Jacobs retail chain is installing point of sale
systems based on Linux in their 180 stores. The U.S. Postal Service
has installed 5000 OCR systems based on Linux to scan mail. Also,
Linux is being used to run elevators in Japan, trains in Germany
and interactive TV in Denmark&mdash;even to mediate reality in
Canada.</p><p>Is there still a community here? Yes. Its members aren't
sales clerks in Jay Jacobs stores or postal workers bagging mail,
who most likely don't even know they are using Linux. They are the
people porting software to Linux, IT managers selecting Linux and
those installing Linux. These people need to work together and
learn from the work of others.</p><p>To help build this community, <i  >Linux Journal</i> has done two things. First, I volunteered to
coordinate a mailing list for Independent Software Vendors (ISVs)
as part of the Linux standardization project. This list is designed
to give ISVs an opportunity to have a united voice in the
standardization effort. Second, we added an IT Solutions supplement
to <i  >Linux Journal</i>, designed to help IT
professionals see Linux as a possible solution to their needs. The
first supplement appeared with the January, 1999 issue of
<i  >LJ</i>; the next will appear with the June
issue.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b4580.0x29ac8c8"></a>Two Communities?</h2></div></div><p>We are, in fact, building two communities. If this was
happening with proprietary software such as Microsoft products, I
would see this as a problem. In the Linux realm, however, I feel
all is well. Let me explain.</p><p>The Linux development community benefits from growth in the
commercial use of Linux. This growth also means more hardware and
software vendors will want to support Linux, resulting in more
potential employment for Linux professionals.</p><p>On the other end, commercial users of Linux benefit from
growth in the development community. Unlike proprietary software,
more developers means better software without increased
cost.</p><p>These two communities complement each other. Their levels of
interests or understanding may not all be the same, but one
benefits the other; hence, cooperation is needed between the
two.</p><p><i  >Linux Journal</i> has plans to aid in that
cooperation. Just as we provided a forum for developers and
newcomers in the early stages, we hope to provide a forum for the
development and commercial communities to better understand each
other. We are addressing this goal by doing the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>IT Solutions supplements, help for business
professionals wanting to know what Linux can do for them</p></li><li><p>Linux Resources (http://www.linuxresources.com/), a
starting place for finding all you want to know about Linux</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em><i>Linux Journal</i> Interactive</em></span>
(http://interactive.linuxjournal.com/), containing serious articles
on Linux from both a technical and a business point of view</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span>
(http://www.linuxgazette.com/), an open forum for discussion of
technical issues, as well as articles and Linux tips</p></li></ul></div><p>SSC, the owner of <i  >Linux Journal</i>,
publishes books and reference cards to help people use Linux and
Linux-related programs. Examples include books on Samba and the
GIMP and a whole series of reference cards to help the more
technical user deal with utility programs included in Linux
distributions. In 1999, expect to see new titles to help Linux move
to the desktop. More information can be found at
http://www.ssc.com/.
</p><p>The bottom line is we have been a part of the Linux community
since 1993 when SSC first began selling Linux distributions. The
Linux community and <i  >Linux Journal</i> have grown
up together, and we plan to remain the primary print resource for
Linux as its evolution continues.</p><p>Phil Hughes, Publisher</p></div></div>
