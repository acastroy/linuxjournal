    No, it is not that thing you use to stir up food in your
    kitchen&mdash;it is a hot new state-of-the-art 3-D modeler.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ad580.0x16a5500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Blender is a free, full-featured 3-D
modelling and rendering environment. In the words of the Blender
web site:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Being the in-house software of a high quality
animation studio, Blender has proven to be an extremely fast and
versatile design instrument. The software has a personal touch,
offering a unique approach to the world of three dimensions. Use
Blender to create TV commercials, to make technical visualizations,
business graphics, to do some morphing or to design user
interfaces. You can easily build and manage complex environments.
The renderer is versatile and extremely fast. All basic animation
principles (curves and keys) are well-implemented.</p></blockquote></div>

If you have any previous experience with 3-D modelers, one of the
first things you will notice after playing around a bit with
Blender is that it is incredibly fast. The primary author, Ton
Roosendaal, says one of his favorite hobbies is throwing extraneous
code out of Blender, and it shows.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ad580.0x16a56b8"></a>Blender History</h2></div></div><p>Way back in 1989, Ton Roosendaal started up an animation
studio called NeoGeo with a handful of friends. They wrote their
own in-house 3-D software, &ldquo;Traces&rdquo;, but Ton was not satisfied
with it. He evaluated it (as well as SoftImage and Alias), analyzed
its shortcomings, and in 1995 started work on Blender. In January
1998, NeoGeo released the SGI version of Blender. Due to the
immense popularity of the program, Linux and FreeBSD versions were
soon released in April. In mid-1998, NeoGeo was partly taken over
by another company (Alatis), so Ton created a new independent
company, &ldquo;Not a Number&rdquo;, to take over Blender development.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ad580.0x16a57c0"></a>Getting Blender</h2></div></div><p>The main Blender web site is at
http://www.blender.nl/blender.html. The software is available at
NeoGeo's FTP site, but it is best to find an FTP site
geographically closer to you. Linux and FreeBSD x86 versions are
available, but if you have an Alpha, SPARC or Power PC, you are out
of luck. Hopefully, ports will soon be released for other
platforms. However, there is a broader availability for SGI's&mdash;from
R3000-based Indigos all the way to the R10000-based Octanes.</p><p>Download the archive file you want, either
blenderLinux-dynamic_<span   class="emphasis"><em>x.xx</em></span>.tar.gz or
blenderLinux-static_<span   class="emphasis"><em>x.xx</em></span>.tar.gz, where
<span   class="emphasis"><em>x.xx</em></span> is the version number. (The current
version at the time of this writing is 1.37.) The dynamic version
is linked to the Mesa 3.0 libraries as well as a few others, so if
you don't have Mesa, get the static version.</p><p>If you want, you can also grab the Blender tutorial files
(tutor_1.01.tar.gz and tutor_2.0.tar.gz). The version 1.01
tutorials aren't actually tutorials&mdash;they are example files, but
they don't show you how to create the files. Regardless, try them
out, since they are pretty cool. Examples include a bat animation,
a short sequence from &ldquo;The Lost Ride&rdquo;, a 3-D game by NeoGeo and a
cool walking spider animation, in addition to a bunch of others.
The version 2.0 tutorial shows how to morph a cube into a sphere
and includes a tutorial on how to do the morphing. In addition to
the two tutorial files, you can get the Blacksmith demo which
includes examples of particle animation (i.e., fire and
smoke).</p><p>I would suggest getting the manual&mdash;manual_1.02.html.tar.gz.
While it is a little out of date, some of the information still
holds true. It especially helps in understanding how Blender is
object-oriented.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ad580.0x16a5ad8"></a>System Requirements</h2></div></div><p>Even though the Blender web site says the minimum system is a
Pentium 90 with 32MB of RAM, I've found that a fast 486 (DX2 66 or
better) with 16MB of RAM is adequate for simple modelling and even
for some more complex stuff. Still, if you want to do serious
modelling, you definitely need at least a P90. As noted above,
however, at this time you must have an x86 machine. You will need
at least an 800x600 resolution screen (the buttons are a bit
squashed though, so if you can get 1024x768 or better, go for it)
and you definitely need at least 15bpp. You might be able to get
away with 8bpp, but I would heavily advise against it. For one
thing, everything is green, and in some rare cases, Blender might
even crash.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ad580.0x16a5be0"></a>Installing Blender</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Once you've downloaded the Blender archive file,
move it to the installation directory and unpack it:
<pre     class="programlisting">
        gunzip -c blenderLinux-xxx.tar.gz | tar -xv
</pre>

</p></li><li><p>Change directories to the blenderLinux_xxx
directory (<b  >cd&nbsp;blenderLinux_xxx</b>).</p></li><li><p>Copy all of the .B files to your home directory
(<b  >cp&nbsp;.B*h&nbsp;~</b>).</p></li><li><p>For bash users: edit your /etc/profile file (or if
you're installing locally, $HOME/.bash_profile) by adding a line
that reads:
<pre     class="programlisting">
        export BLENDERDIR=/
</pre>

</p></li><li><p>For tcsh and csh users: create an environment
variable <b  >BLENDERDIR</b> in your $HOME/.cshrc file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
        setenv BLENDERDIR /
</pre>

</p></li><li><p>Restart your shell.</p></li><li><p>Run Blender (<b  >blender</b>).</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ad580.0x16a6420"></a>Basic Usage</h2></div></div><p>If you haven't used 3-D software before, the GUI may look
complex and difficult at first, but you'll get used to it. When you
first start up Blender, you'll see a large grid in the center of
the screen&mdash;that's the 3-D window. Down on the bottom is the
buttons area. Finally, at the top is the options area, where you
choose which scene to edit, font paths, etc. If you are running on
a small display (800x600 or less), you may not be able to see most
of the top window. In this case, click on the edge of the top
window and drag it down until you can see it. For now, you need
only be concerned with the 3-D window and the buttons
window.</p><p><a href="3140s1.html" target="_self">Basic keystrokes/mouse
movements</a></p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3140f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Initial Blender Screen
</p></div></div><p>All of the Blender widgets and menus are rendered through
Mesa; this means you can zoom in and pan around almost anything.
For example, in the buttons window (down at the bottom), you can
hold <b  >Ctrl-MiddleMouseButton</b> and drag around to
zoom in or out. Notice that when you zoom, the buttons, including
the fonts, are scaled. To pan, use the middle mouse button and drag
around. This works everywhere&mdash;even in the button bars on each
window.</p><p>The black cross with a red and white striped circle around
the center is called the 3-D cursor. Whenever you add an object, it
will be placed at the location of the 3-D cursor. To move the 3-D
cursor, just left-click on the spot where you want it.</p><p>The black triangle with the little yellow ball (a few units
down from the center) is the camera. Right-click on it to select,
then press <b  >g</b> to move it around. When you decide
on a location for the camera, click the left mouse button.</p><p>The Blender windowing system is somewhat similar to HTML
frames. Each window can be infinitely split (though a practical
limit does exist&mdash;if you can't see the windows any more, you've
gone too far) by moving the mouse into the window to be split, then
clicking with the middle mouse button on the window pane
perpendicular to the direction of split. If you want to split a
window horizontally, click on either the left or right vertical
pane. Then when &ldquo;Split?&rdquo; comes up, click on it. To join two split
windows, right-click on the pane you want to remove, then click on
&ldquo;Join?&rdquo; when it comes up.</p><p>Two main editing modes are included: normal and edit. You can
toggle between the two using the <b  >tab</b> key. When
you add an object, Blender automatically switches to edit mode (for
most objects, anyway). For example, let's say we add a Mesh cube.
When the cube appears on the screen, it is in edit mode. If you
right-click on one of its vertices (the purple dot means it is not
selected, the yellow dot means it is), you can then press
<b  >g</b> to move the vertex around. If you press
<b  >b</b>, which stands for &ldquo;Border Select&rdquo;, you can
draw a rectangle over the selected vertices.</p><p>The Toolbox is brought up using the space bar and enables you
to add objects. Note that you can also use the <b  >Add
primitive</b> function (<b  >shift-A</b>), which
brings up the Toolbox and the Add submenu. Most of the hot keys are
placed here. If you need to get out of the Toolbox window, either
press <b  >esc</b> (the standard for Blender windows) or
move the mouse away from the window.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3140f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
