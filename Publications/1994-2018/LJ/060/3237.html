    Using Perl to make network task is easy&mdash;here's how.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af0580.0x1be83f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Perl has been called the glue that holds
the Internet together because it is an extremely powerful text
processing and CGI programming language. Although Perl was designed
in the beginning to be a text manipulation language, it has evolved
into a potent multi-purpose programming language. One area in which
Perl has shown its power is that of network programming.
</p><p>Perl makes network programming easy by providing built-in
functions that can be used to create low-level client/server
programs from scratch. Also, many modules are freely available that
make programming common networking tasks simple and quick. These
tasks include pinging remote machines, TELNET and FTP sessions.
This article presents examples of each of these types of network
programs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af0580.0x1be8558"></a>Introduction</h2></div></div><p>Client/server network programming requires a server running
on one machine to serve one or more clients running on either the
same machine or different machines. These different machines can be
located anywhere on the network.</p><p>To create a server, simply perform the following steps using
the built-in Perl function indicated:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Create a socket with
<span   class="bold"><b>socket</b></span>.</p></li><li><p>Bind the socket to a port address with
<span   class="bold"><b>bind</b></span>.</p></li><li><p>Listen to the socket at the port address with
<span   class="bold"><b>listen</b></span>.</p></li><li><p>Accept client connections with
<span   class="bold"><b>accept</b></span>.</p></li></ul></div><p>Establishing a client is even easier:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Create a socket with
<span   class="bold"><b>socket</b></span>.</p></li><li><p>Connect (the socket) to the remote machine with
<span   class="bold"><b>connect</b></span>.</p></li></ul></div><p>Several other required functions and variables are defined in
the <span   class="bold"><b>Socket.pm</b></span> module. This module
is probably already installed on your machine, but if not, it is
available at the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN), the
official Perl source code repository (see Resources). To use this
module in our programs, the following statement is required at the
top of the program:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
use Socket;
</pre><p>This statement will locate the file Socket.pm and import all
of its exported functions and variables.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af0580.0x1be8f50"></a>Viewing Module Documentation</h2></div></div><p>All examples in this article use modules that are available
at no cost from CPAN.</p><p>Perl modules are usually self-documenting. If the author of
the module follows the generally accepted rules of creating a Perl
module, they will add Plain Old Documentation (POD) to the module's
.pm file. One way to view the POD for the Socket module (assuming
Perl and Socket.pm were installed correctly) is to execute the
following at the shell:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
perldoc Socket
</pre><p>This command displays Socket.pm's POD converted to a man
page. The output is a relatively thorough discussion of the
functions and variables defined in this module.
</p><p>Another way to view the documentation is to convert the POD
to text using:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
pod2text \
/usr/lib/perl5/i686-linux/5.00404/Socket.pm | more
</pre><p>The program <span   class="bold"><b>pod2text</b></span> is
included in the Perl distribution, as are the programs
<span   class="bold"><b>pod2html</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>pod2man</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>pod2usage</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>pod2latex</b></span>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af0580.0x1be9420"></a>A Simple Server</h2></div></div><p><a href="3237l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a></p><p>Our first programming example is a simple server running on
one machine that can service only one client program at a time
connecting from the same or a different machine. Recall that the
steps for creating a server were to create a socket, bind it to a
port, listen at the port and accept client connections.</p><p>Listing 1, server1.pl, is the source code for this simple
server. First, it is generally a good idea to compile using Perl's
strict rules:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
use strict;
</pre><p>This requires all variables to be declared with the
<span   class="bold"><b>my</b></span> function before they are used.
Using my may be inconvenient, but it can catch many common
syntactically correct yet logically incorrect programming bugs.
</p><p>The variable <b  >$port</b> is assigned the first
command-line argument or port 7890 as the default. When choosing a
port for your server, pick one that is unused on your machine. Note
that the only way to ensure you select a port that does not have a
predefined use is to look at the appropriate RFC (see
Resources).</p><p>Next, the socket is created using the socket function. A
socket is like a file handle&mdash;it can be read from, written to or
both. The function <span   class="bold"><b>setsockopt</b></span> is
called to ensure that the port will be immediately reusable.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>sockaddr_in</b></span> function
obtains a port on the server. The argument
<b  >INADDR_ANY</b> chooses one of the server's virtual
IP addresses. You could instead decide to bind only one of the
virtual IP addresses by replacing <b  >INADDR_ANY</b>
with</p><pre     class="programlisting">
inet_aton("192.168.1.1")
</pre><p>or
<pre     class="programlisting">
gethostbyname("server.onsight.com")
</pre>


The bind function binds the socket to the port, i.e., plugs the
socket into that port. Then, the listen function causes the server
to begin listening at the port. The second argument to the listen
function is the maximum queue length or the maximum number of
pending client connections. The value <b  >SOMAXCONN</b>
is the maximum queue length for the machine being used.
</p><p>Once the server begins listening at the port, it can accept
client connections using the accept function. When the client is
accepted, a new socket is created named <b  >CLIENT</b>
which can be used like a file handle. Reading from the socket reads
the client's output and printing to the socket sends data to the
client.</p><p>To read from a file handle or socket in Perl, wrap it in
angle brackets (&lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>FH</em></span>&gt;). To write to it,
use the <span   class="bold"><b>print</b></span> function:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
print SOCKET;
</pre><p>The return value of the accept function is the Internet
address of the client in a packed format. The function sockaddr_in
takes that format and returns the client's port number and the
client's numeric Internet address in a packed format. The packed
numeric Internet address can be converted to a text string
representing the numeric IP using
<span   class="bold"><b>inet_ntoa</b></span> (numeric to ASCII). To
convert the packed numeric address to a host name, the function
<span   class="bold"><b>gethostbyaddr</b></span> is used.
</p><p>Let's assume all of the servers referred to in this article
are started on the machine named server.onsight.com. To start the
server on this machine, execute:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[james@server networking]$ server1.pl
SERVER started on port 7890
</pre><p>The server is now listening at port 7890 on
server.onsight.com, waiting for clients to connect.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af0580.0x1fe21c8"></a>A Simple Client</h2></div></div><p><a href="3237l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2.</a></p><p>Listing 2, client1.pl, shows a simple client. The first
command-line argument to this program is the host name to which it
should connect, which defaults to server.onsight.com. The second
command-line argument is the port number which defaults to
7890.</p><p>The host name and the port number are used to generate the
port address using <span   class="bold"><b>inet_aton</b></span>
(ASCII to numeric) and sockaddr_in. A socket is then created using
socket and the client connects the socket to the port address using
connect.</p><p>The <b  >while</b> loop then reads the data the
server sends to the client until the end-of-file is reached,
printing this input to STDOUT. Then the socket is closed.</p><p>Let's assume all of the clients are started on the the
machine named client.avue.com, although they could be executed from
any machine on the network. To execute the client, type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[james@client networking]$ client1.pl server.onsight.com
Hello from the server: Tue Oct 27 09:48:40 1998
</pre><p>The following is the standard output from the server:
<pre     class="programlisting">

when you want to control how the socket is created, the protocol to
be used, etc. But using the functions above is too hard; I prefer
the easy way&mdash;<span   class="bold"><b>IO::Socket</b></span>.</p><p>The module IO::Socket provides an easy way to create sockets
which can then be used like file handles. If you don't have it
installed on your machine, it can be found on CPAN. To see this
module's POD, type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
perldoc IO::Socket
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af0580.0x1fe2850"></a>A Simple Server Using IO::Socket</h2></div></div><p><a href="3237l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3.</a></p><p>Listing 3, serverIO.pl, is a simple server using IO::Socket.
A new <b  >IO::Socket::INET</b> object is created using
the <span   class="bold"><b>new</b></span> method. Note that the
arguments to the method include the host name, port number,
protocol, queue length and an option indicating we want this port
to be immediately reusable. The new method returns a socket that is
assigned to <b  >$sock</b>. This socket can be used like
a file handle&mdash;we can either read the client output from it, or
write to it by sending data to the client.</p><p>A client connection is accepted using the accept method. Note
the accept method returns the client socket when evaluated in
scalar context:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$new_sock = $sock-&gt;accept()
</pre><p>and returns the client's socket and the client's IP address
when evaluated in list context:
<pre     class="programlisting">
($new_sock, $client_addr) = $sock-&gt;accept()
</pre>


The client address is computed and printed the same as in Listing
1, server1.pl. Then the socket associated with that client is read
until end-of-file. The data read is printed to STDOUT. This example
illustrates that the server can read from a client using &lt; &gt;
around the socket variable.

<b  >IO::Socket</b>. This time, a new object is created
that connects to a host at a port using the TCP protocol. Ten
strings are then printed to that server, then the socket is
closed.</p><p>If the server in Listing 3, serverIO.pl, is executed and then
the client Listing 4, clientIO.pl, connects, the output would
be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

with one another in both directions. For instance, the client may
send information to the server, then the server may send
information back to the client. Therefore, network programs can be
written so that the server and client follow some predetermined
protocol.</p><p><a href="3237l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5.</a></p><p>Listing 5, server2way.pl, shows how a simple server can be
created to read a command from a client, then print out an
appropriate response to the client. The module
<span   class="bold"><b>Sys::Hostname</b></span> provides a function
named <span   class="bold"><b>hostname</b></span> that returns the
host name of the server. To insure output is seen as we print, IO
buffering is turned off for the STDOUT file handle using the
<span   class="bold"><b>autoflush</b></span> function. Then a
<b  >while</b> loop is executed that accepts connections.
When a client connects, the server reads a line from the client,
chopping off the newline character. Then a
<b  >switch</b> statement is executed. (The
<b  >switch</b> is cleverly disguised as a
<b  >foreach</b> loop, which happens to be one of my
favorite ways of writing a <b  >switch</b>.) Depending on
the input entered by the client, the server outputs an appropriate
response. All lines from the client are read until
end-of-file.</p><p><a href="3237l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6.</a></p><p>Listing 6, client2way.pl, shows the companion client. A
connection to the server is made, then the client prints a few
commands to the server reads the response and prints the response
to <b  >STDOUT</b>.</p><p>The following is the output of the client code in Listing
6:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

STDIN and sends them to the server, the easiest solution is to
write a client that forks a child. (A solution can be written using
<span   class="bold"><b>select</b></span> that does not fork, but it
is more complicated.) The client's parent process will read the
commands from the user through STDIN and print them to the server.
The client's child process will then read from the server and print
the responses to STDOUT.</p><p><a href="3237l7.html" target="_self">Listing 7.</a></p><p>Listing 7, clientfork.pl, is an example of a client that
forks.</p><p>To fork in Perl, call the cleverly named
<span   class="bold"><b>fork</b></span> function. It returns

returns <b  >0</b> to the child, non-zero (the child's
pid) to the parent. In clientfork.pl, an <b  >if</b>
statement checks the value of <b  >$kid</b>, the return
value from the fork. If <b  >$kid</b> is true (non-zero,
the child's pid), parent executes reading from STDIN printing to

approach to a server that can handle more than one client is a
server that forks a child process to handle each client connection.
Listing 8, serverfork.pl, is an example of a forking server.</p><p>One way for the parent process to reap its children is to
define a subroutine and assign a reference to that subroutine to
<b  >$SIG{CHLD}</b>. (The hash <b  >%SIG</b> is
Perl's way of handling signals.) In this example, a subroutine
named <span   class="bold"><b>REAP</b></span> is defined and a
reference to this subroutine is assigned to
<b  >$SIG{CHLD}</b>. When the parent receives the
<b  >CHLD</b> (child terminated) signal, the REAP
subroutine will be invoked.</p><p>Within the <b  >while</b> loop that accepts all the

parent is running and it executes the <b  >next</b>
statement which immediately transfers control to the

of closing the child socket and waits for the next client to
connect. If the fork returns <b  >undef</b>, then the
fork failed, so the server dies. If the fork returns neither true
nor <b  >undef</b>, then the child is running, so the
parent socket is closed and the child reads from the client and
processes the client. When the child is finished processing the
client, the child exits and is reaped by the parent.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af0580.0x1ef5ea8"></a>Thread Programming in Perl5.005</h2></div></div><p>Perl version 5.005 supports thread programming. This means a

automating TELNET sessions easy. Listing 13, telnet.pl, is an
example of connecting to a machine, sending a few system commands
and printing the result.</p><p>First, a server and a user name are used. The user name
defaults to the user running the script by assigning to
<b  >$user</b> the value <b  >$ENV{USER}</b>.
(The hash <b  >%ENV</b> contains all of the environment
variables the script inherits from the shell.)</p><p>Next, the password is requested, then read in. Note that
turning off the stty echoing is done through a
<span   class="bold"><b>system</b></span> call. It can also be done
using the <span   class="bold"><b>Term::ReadKey</b></span>
module.</p><p>Then, a <b  >Net::Telnet</b> object is created. To
log in to the server using this object, the
<span   class="bold"><b>login</b></span> method is called. Several
system commands are executed using the
<span   class="bold"><b>cmd</b></span> method which returns the
STDOUT of the system command which is then printed. Note that part
of that output is the system prompt, which is printed along with
the output of the command.</p><p>Also note that the code
<b  >$tn-&gt;cmd('/usr/bin/who')</b> is evaluated in list
context and stored in <b  >@who</b>, which is an array
that contains all the lines of ouptut of that command, one line of
output per array element.</p><p>After all of the system commands are executed, the TELNET
session is closed.</p><p>Here is an example output of Listing 13, telnet.pl:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
