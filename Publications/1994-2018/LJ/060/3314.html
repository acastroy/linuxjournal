community with the freely available Tcl scripting language and its
companion toolkit Tk. These days he is busy running his company
Scriptics, where he is developing commercial tools for use in
developing Tcl/Tk applications. I talked to him by phone in
December 1998, when Scriptics released TclPro 1.1 for Linux.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: The first thing I
would like to know is what is the big deal with porting to Linux?
Haven't Tcl products always worked with Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: The big deal! You have
to distinguish between Tcl the language and the TclPro product. Tcl
the scripting language, its toolkit Tk and all the various
extensions available for them have worked on Linux for years,
probably five years or more. They are present on most of the
popular Linux distributions, various CDs by Red Hat and others. The
news we are talking about right now is our company's TclPro
product, which is a set of development tools. We have just made a
new release that supports Linux for the first time. Our previous
releases did not support Linux, although you could run Tcl programs
on Linux, our development tools which make it easier to develop Tcl
scripts were not yet available to you.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What operating
system were they running on?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: Scriptics is a fairly
young company&mdash;we've been around just about a year now. We released
our first product, TclPro 1.0, in September and it ran on Windows
95 and 98, NT and two UNIX variants, Solaris and HP-UX. We thought
about including Linux support from the start, but we guessed that
since Linux was a free platform that not many people would be
interested in buying products for it. The TclPro Toolset is a
commercial product.</p><p>So, we didn't initially support Linux. We thought we'd
probably do it eventually, just not right away. Then as soon as we
made the first beta release last summer, we were inundated with
requests for Linux&mdash;it was truly a pleasant surprise to see how
much interest there was from the Linux community. It began to
appear to us that, in fact, Linux people are actually interested in
this kind of tool and would even be willing to pay for it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: It's amazing,
isn't it?&mdash;that they'd be willing to pay!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: Well, my take on this
is that Linux may have started off with a community of gung-ho
users who were attracted by the freeness of it. I think more and
more people are now using Linux because of the sophisticated
features and reliability it provides, and the fact that it is free
is a bonus. People are willing to pay for software that adds value
to their Linux systems.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: I think they are
too, definitely.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: Once we started
getting all these requests for Linux, we realized we had goofed in
not planning for Linux in our first release. We looked at getting
it into that 1.0 release, but it would have messed up the schedule
too much. So, we planned a 1.1 release as soon as possible after
the first release. That's what we are doing right now. It's been
about three months since we made the 1.0 release. The 1.1 release
adds a port for Linux and the SGI platform.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: How much work did
it take to do the port? We've heard from some people that all
they've had to do is run <b  >make</b>.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: Yeah, Tcl is very
portable, and so was TclPro. The only hassle was actually getting a
Linux machine here and getting the build environment set up with C
compilers, etc. Once we had that done, it was only a day or two of
work to get TclPro running on Linux.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: We like to hear
that it was quick and easy.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: One of the neat things
about Tcl is that it is an extremely portable programming
environment&mdash;Tcl, all its applications, and all the TclPro tools
are actually built with Tcl. Thus, they are all very portable. In
some sense, this is a relatively minor announcement for Scriptics
in that it is an upgrade release. It has a couple of new features
but nothing earthshaking in the way of features. However, I think
it's a very interesting release as yet another confirmation of how
much demand there is for commercial products for Linux. I also
think it is an interesting confirmation of how important Tcl is to
the Linux community&mdash;people who use Linux are crying out for it.
Tcl is one of the best ways of doing graphical user interfaces and
also a variety of other applications on Linux.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: I think that's
true, too. What advantages do you think Tcl has over other
scripting languages?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: That's a good one. The
real power Tcl brings is that it's wonderful for creating
integration. Compared to other scripting languages, Tcl's advantage
is that it can be used for a huge variety of applications. Most
other scripting languages were designed for a particular domain.
For example, Perl was initially designed for system administration
and reporting tasks; JavaScript was designed for scripting in web
browsers. These languages work great in the areas for which they
were designed, but sometimes don't work as well in other areas (for
example, JavaScript isn't used much at all outside web browsers).
Tcl was designed to be used in many different areas, and it has
worked well that way. Thus, if you have a variety of things to
integrate, Tcl is likely to provide the most flexible
platform.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Which tools
included in Tcl do you think will be most appreciated by Linux
developers?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: Well, definitely the
debugger&mdash;all programmers need that tool. Also, the Error Checker
and the Wrapper will be useful for Linux programmers. Actually,
after thinking about this some more, I think all four of the TclPro
tools will be useful for Linux developers. Linux developers are not
that different from other developers, so I think they will use all
the same tools.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Tcl has always
been Open Source; TclPro is commercial. How does Scriptics intend
to balance this act in the future?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: The core code for Tcl
and Tk will always be freely available. This is a commitment we
have made to the Open Source community. What we will do
commercially is develop products such as TclPro that aid in Tcl
program development. If we gave all our products away, we wouldn't
stay in business long.</p><p>We allow people to download TclPro from our web site with a
free 30-day evaluation license. Since the Linux version became
available in beta form at the beginning of November, it has been
the number two platform in terms of popularity. About 55% of the
evaluation downloads are for Windows (95 and NT). Linux is second
with about 21% of the downloads. Solaris, which we had expected to
be the number two platform, is a distant third with only 13% of the
downloads.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Do you think the
time will come when free software will do away with commercial
software altogether?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: No, but I would be
happy to be proven wrong.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Some say that with
free software, programmers would make their living by consulting
and support.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: That's an interesting
idea, if you think about the personality of someone doing this.
They're most likely going to build something they want to use
themselves, then give it away to others. They tend not to produce
other types of software, leaving many areas open for commercial
software development.</p><p>I think that's why you see operating system cores, scripting
languages, mail delivery tools, web servers and other things which
expert programmers enjoy using themselves as open source and you
don't see enterprise resource planning applications or even things
like word processors and spreadsheets yet.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Well, there are
some applications out there&mdash;they are just not very far
along.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: People like Eric
Raymond think we are just at the beginning of the evolutionary
development of open source software, and that all of these other
applications will come about in time. Maybe he's right. My personal
hunch is that open source development is mostly going to be the
platform and tool kind of software.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: I think the two
examples Eric gives for spreadsheets and word processors are
Maxwell and xxl.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: Well, I'd be happy to
be proven wrong on that too, you know.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Well, I've always
wondered how it would work. As you say, people somewhere along the
line have to make a living.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: I think the whole open
source movement is incredibly intriguing and an amazing and
empowering device for the individual. One smart person with a good
idea and a bit of spare time can harness the energy of thousands of
other people and build software that gets used by hundreds,
thousands or millions of people. How many industries in the world
can be found where such an incredible impact can be made by a
single person? It's a really neat thing that smart people with good
ideas can change the world.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Someone told me
recently that they heard you speak at one of the conferences and
that you didn't feel the open source movement currently addressed
the needs of the unsophisticated or new user. Is that true?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: I think it is often
true. Again, it gets back to the mindset of the open source
developer&mdash;that they are typically building programs for
themselves. So when they make programs available to others, they
tend to have a level of documentation and installation appropriate
for a fairly sophisticated programmer rather than for a novice
programmer. Again, this is an area where commercial efforts can
fill in the gaps by providing the means to make things even easier
to use. A great example of that in the Linux sphere is the arrival
of companies like Red Hat, Caldera and SuSE which have provided
Linux distributions that are much easier to install than they used
to be.</p><p>If you look back about two or three years before those
companies existed, it was a much bigger proposition to install
Linux&mdash;not for the faint of heart!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What motivated you
to decide to write a new scripting language in the first
place?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: Like many other people
doing open source stuff, I was solving a problem of my own. The
problem I had was that I was building a whole bunch of different
tools that needed to have command languages in them and I wanted
them to have a powerful command language. I didn't have the time to
build a separate one for each tool. So the idea for Tcl was to
build a small interpreter that I could plug into different tools,
thus using the same basic language as the command language for many
different programs. I did that by building an extensible language;
Tcl provides all the basics. It can then be dropped into an
application with all of the application's features hooked into Tcl
as extensions adding to the basic features of the language. That
way, I have a very powerful command language in every program, and
all programs share the same core part of the language&mdash;the Tcl
interpreter. That was the basic idea. From there, I added an
extension to do graphical user interfaces called Tk. Then we
suddenly discovered you can actually write many interesting Tcl
scripts without putting Tcl inside another application, but instead
using it stand alone. With Tcl and Tk together, you can write great
GUIs and other sorts of integration applications. Once that
happened, usage by other programmers just exploded.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: One of the first
articles we got about Tcl/Tk was about using it to write a
GUI.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: That ability wasn't
the first thing on my mind when I was writing Tcl, but it turned
out that in solving my problem, I had also built something that was
very easy to use for developing general purpose GUIs.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: How about some
personal type stuff about you? What do you do for fun?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: I do things with my
family for fun. Between being CEO of a startup and trying to be a
good father to my kids, there isn't a lot of time for anything
else. But I enjoy lots of activities with my family.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Okay, how about
where did you go to school, that sort of thing?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: I was an undergraduate
at Yale University in the early 70s and got my Ph.D. in Computer
Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1980. I was a professor
at Berkeley from 1980 to 1994, when I went to Sun. I ran a Tcl
development team at Sun until spinning out to start Scriptics in
January of 1998.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Thanks very much
for your time.</p></div></div>
