    A report on Caldera's new Linux Administration Course.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f0c580.0x2004558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Imagine you are at a piano recital.
Expecting the choppy, hesitant performance of a scared youth, you
suddenly learn that Van Cliburn is in town and has volunteered to
step in so the poor boy can study for finals. What follows is the
smooth, effortless performance of a master, an incredible bargain
for the price of your tickets. So it is with Caldera's new Linux
Administration class.
</p><p>As Linux completes the transition from religious movement to
corporate initiative, the need for serious, accredited training
grows. The class composition in this, the second-ever Linux
Administration course, hailed from all across the U.S. and
reflected the broad appeal of the operating system. Joining me in
the pilgrimage to Caldera's Utah offices were an Internet service
provider, an IT administrator from a community college, a couple of
CAD/imaging specialists, a medical records administrator, an
officer from a medical supplies company, a VAR and a system
administrator from an on-line catalog firm. Previous Linux
experience ranged from extensive to nil.</p><p>I came because the Engineering Tools group I manage at
MCIWorldcom develops web-enabled databases. I'd been using Linux
off and on for several years, but recent testing of the new Linux
releases of Sybase and Oracle had convinced me that a significant
corporate hurdle to using Linux, the availability of major-league
databases, was now gone. Could Linux replace our present NT-based
web and database servers? I attempted to find out.</p><p>The Linux Administration class runs four days, with an
installation class on day five. The course makes few assumptions:
you begin by learning how to properly start and shut down the
system, configure the boot loader, create partitions and file
systems. From there you cover basic system commands, then user and
group management. After learning how to customize the environment
and set permissions, you move on to a very thorough treatment of
networking. We set up a simple network, configured serial
terminals, used NFS and Samba. We synchronized each machine to a
time server, configured FTP and web servers and then set up full
domain name services.</p><p>CGI programming, Sendmail, security and firewalls were
covered briefly but thoroughly. After a session on printing and
package management, we delved into the arcana of system
initialization processes, loading and unloading modules on the fly,
backing up the kernel, even rebuilding the kernel to customize it.
After a discussion of log files and troubleshooting techniques, we
spent the last day installing OpenLinux systems on our class
PCs.</p><p>Throughout the course, I was impressed with the depth of
knowledge the instructor (Wilson Mattos) displayed and the
resources Caldera brought to bear on difficult questions. Eric
Ratliff (working with Linux since release 0.11) and Allan Smart (a
Caldera director) were always on hand to explore involved topics as
deeply as we wished.</p><p>How does the class compare to other industry training
courses? I've taken most of the classes Oracle offers and a good
number from Sun. Unlike other industry courses, our instructors at
Caldera stayed in the room during exercises to help the students.
The instructors didn't read PowerPoint slides to us, and the
exercises in the book were relevant, clear and useful. Even given
the beta nature of the class and the occasional bobble in the
documentation, I would rate the level of instruction and the
professionalism as good or better than most industry short
courses.</p><p>Also to Caldera's credit, the Linux instruction was as
vendor-neutral as possible. The class used networked Caldera
OpenLinux PCs, but Mr. Mattos always covered variations which might
arise with distributions from Red Hat, Debian, Slackware, SuSE,
etc. Class participation was invaluable; members contributed many
useful tips about distribution idiosyncrasies and about Linux in
general.</p><p>The little things you'd expect from a Linux vendor were also
present&mdash;the &ldquo;Designed for Windows95&rdquo; sticker strategically
placed on the copier waste basket, abundant refreshments, the
vigorous debate that arose over future Linux certification tests.
(Does complying with the GNU open-source license mean Caldera must
include answers with the certification questions?)</p><p>The one-day installation class at the end of the week
clarified the often obscure aspects of loading up Linux. In
addition to giving everyone a boxed copy of their latest Linux
release, Caldera instructors even helped class members get Linux up
and running on their personal laptops.</p><p>I would have preferred more elementary coverage of certain
basics (shell scripting, for example) at the expense of advanced
networking instruction, but the class did a good job of distilling
the core knowledge of Linux into a retainable, five-day
package.</p><p>Will I now go back and lobby MCIWorldcom to put Linux on
every desktop? Probably not. Even with the slick new KDE X
interface in Caldera's latest distribution, I think it is still
going to take further evolution before the corporate desktop line
is breached. However, my company places a premium on finding the
most cost-effective, efficient ways to run its telcom business, and
ignoring opportunities has never been a winning strategy. I think
Linux can find a secure home right now on machines used as
corporate servers. No matter how you slice it, running Linux on
network file, print, mail, database and web servers delivers potent
bang for the buck. These systems scale quite well, are remarkably
stable and are least restrictive in terms of development options.
Major league databases are now running quite well on Linux (Sybase
comes bundled with the latest OpenLinux release) and the remaining
corporate concerns about support and formal training are being
handled capably by companies like Caldera.</p><p>I'd like to thank the Caldera staff for good value on the
education dollar and for their hospitality during the class. I'd
also like to thank the Engineering Tools group at MCIWorldcom for
tolerating my Linux evangelism.</p></div></div>
