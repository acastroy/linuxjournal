computers. The shareware price is user-defined.</p></li><li><p>Reviewer: Charles Curley</p></li></ul></div><p>Arkeia software presents a backup solution to administrators
of heterogeneous networks of all sizes. From a one-computer shop to
a large shop with hundreds of computers, Arkeia is designed to work
on any size IP network. It also works cleanly with a mix of widely
different operating systems. The product is aimed at professional
network administrators, but don't let that scare you off. It is
documented well enough that an amateur who is reasonably
knowledgeable about Linux and his organization's network can set up
and run the software. The product installs easily on Linux and on
Windows 95. This is the kind of product that will make Linux a
serious contender as a real-world operating system.
</p><p>The server software can run on Linux, Solaris, SGI, AIX,
HP-UX or SCO. Give it a fast connection to your network and one or
more fast tape drives, and you are ready. Clients, in addition to
the servers just listed, include Windows NT, Windows 95 and 98,
Novell, VMS, ICL and others. The servers and clients communicate
over TCP/IP, so the physical layer of your network doesn't matter.
You don't need Windows sharing or NFS to do your backups.</p><p>To review the software, I downloaded the shareware version. I
set up the server on my 333 MHz Pentium II Red Hat 5.0 Linux box
and put the Windows 95 client on my 166 MHz Pentium laptop. They
are connected over a TCP/IP network on Ethernet. The installation
and operation manuals are in Adobe PDF format.</p><p>The software for Linux comes in gzipped tar files and
contains its own installation software. The installation software
inserts the NLSERVD daemon into the boot sequence and starts it
running, so as soon as you finish the installation you are ready to
use the product. Knox does not offer an RPM version. The software
goes into its own /usr subdirectory and uses one file of its own
under /etc, so there is no conflict with an RPM system.</p><p>The Windows 95 client software is delivered in a
professionally done InstallShield package. The average Windows user
who can install his own software will be able to install it with no
problem. It correctly saves and restores Windows 95
attributes&mdash;something backups over SAMBA to a non-Windows tape
server won't necessarily do. The Windows 95 client will not back up
a file while Word 6 has it open, but will get the automatic backup
file if there is one. This is a failing of Windows 95, not Arkeia;
the only workaround is for users to shut down programs when they
leave for the day.</p><p>The interface for the software is a GUI using X on Linux. It
was a bit disconcerting when I first saw it but is internally
consistent, and I quickly learned to use it. Tool tips make the
software much easier to use.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3166f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Backing up a Windows 95 laptop showed an average rate of
20MB per minute and a compression ratio of 1.4 to 1.

</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3166f2.large.jpg"><img src="3166f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The main backup window shows a test backup to the null
device. 65MB into the backup, the average data rate of 81MB per
minute shows what the software could do on a Pentium II processor
at 333 MHz. Note the error message with the yellow flag, which will
be logged.

</p></div></div><p>Because the software is clearly designed to support large
shops, Arkeia is conceptually more complicated than typical backup
software such as BRU. Before you can even do a test backup, you
must define a number of objects.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>You must define tapes to the system. Provisions are
made for writing labels with bar codes for use with robot arms.
(Since I don't have a robot arm, I was unable to test that part of
the system.)</p></li><li><p>Tapes are combined into tape pools. The software
rotates the tapes within each pool as needed.</p></li><li><p>You also define &ldquo;savepacks&rdquo;. These are the
computers and directories on the computers to be backed up in
units. For example, I have a savepack that consists of my laptop. I
could easily define a savepack that consists of several computers
(say, a department of a company) or one that consists of a single
directory on one machine (such as an engineer's CAD
drawings).</p></li></ul></div><p>Customer support, even for the shareware package, is
excellent. I made an error and e-mailed the support address for
help. They replied with a preliminary diagnosis and a request for
some log files. I returned those and got a diagnosis back within 24
hours of my first e-mail. Try that with any large software vendor.
I was favorably impressed. I also made some suggestions for
improving the product. The return e-mail indicated that my
suggestions will be seriously considered. Again, Knox compares
favorably with many software vendors.
</p><p>One thing I like in a backup package, but is missing, is a
manual retension command. Of course, I can use <b  >mt
retension</b> on most any UNIX or Linux box. Arkeia also has
a provision for a user-defined command-line operation before and
after each backup. If you like retensions before each use of a
tape, add it here. This is customization I have not seen with other
tape backup programs.</p><p>Scheduled backups are essential in any production shop.
Defining them is simple and flexible. You can run daily, weekly,
monthly and yearly backups. Periodic backups are defined in terms
of savepacks and tape pools. For unattended backup, you can require
a new tape with each backup.</p><p>Pricing is reasonable compared to an NT server network backup
package. The shareware version has no set price, but a quarter of
contributions over $20 will be contributed to Software in the
Public Interest, the organization which supports the Debian Linux
distribution. Details are readily available on the Knox web
site.</p><p>Using Arkeia on Linux means no expensive NT server licenses.
It also means you can find a use for that old 486 box the IT
department has been using for a doorstop because NT on anything
short of a Pentium 200 is too slow to use.</p><p>Network backup is probably <span   class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span>
mission-critical application in any organization. I have no qualms
about recommending Arkeia on Linux for that application. If you
want to investigate this package further, get the manual from
Knox's web site and read it. Better yet, get the manual and the
software and use them, as I did.</p></div></div>
