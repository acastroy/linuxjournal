media)</p></li><li><p>Reviewer: Stephanie Black</p></li></ul></div><p>The need for business applications that run on Linux is well
documented. We all want something that will further diminish the
hold of the Redmond Contingent on the corporate market. We want to
be able to cheer on anyone bold enough, brash enough and bright
enough to create a successful rival to Microsoft Office 2000.
&ldquo;Successful&rdquo; is the key word here.
</p><p>This certainly is an office suite. The manual says you can do
everything administrative from &ldquo;one place&rdquo;. It's described as
&ldquo;intuitive&rdquo;. The first claim assumes that the user has no
temporal requirements with respect to those administrative tasks:
it can take a while just to find the required administrative task.
The second claim assumes that the user has been doing this sort of
work for far too long, only under one other operating system.
&ldquo;Star&rdquo; quality is elusive.</p><p>Granted, it doesn't cost a few hundred units of your local
currency, even if you want the media. It installs without a hitch.
It no longer requires every iota of available memory to run, unlike
its predecessors. It's not a &ldquo;special&rdquo; or &ldquo;millennium&rdquo; edition.
It's available for several different platforms. It doesn't crash
when you open it. Technically, all the pieces are there in nearly
the exact order as described in the manual. It apparently works as
a word processor, presentation tool and Swiss Army Knife clone.
And, I have to admit, the technical support available for it really
is superb.</p><p>The problem is, someone decided StarOffice should follow St.
Paul's dictates, to wit: to be all things to all people. StarOffice
is not, and will never be, all things to all people. If it manages
to be a simple suite of office software that is clean, original,
functional and comprehensible, it will be enough for thousands.
Especially if running it on 64MB of RAM makes for a quick
initialization, as opposed to one during which you can talk with
your lawyer, editor, mother-in-law and local bill collectors and
still have time to get a cup of Starbucks Special before the
software is ready to actually use.</p><p>Hint: there's a Start button at the bottom left of the
application window, and it's labeled that way. The butterfly pixmap
makes no difference to the functioning of the software.
Really.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2472580.0x256aa28"></a>Installation Notes</h2></div></div><p>You will not necessarily require a whole Gig of either hard
drive space or RAM to install StarOffice. Both, admittedly, might
be helpful if you're going to use really large databases, but
they're not necessary. I chose a custom installation of about 250MB
running on SuSE 6.4. You can choose parts of packages, if you don't
want the full allotment of graphics, templates, effects and
backgrounds, but wish for only a selection of those gallery items
that suit your purposes. This applies to other components of
StarOffice as well. For this review, Draw, Image, Basic and Calc
were omitted.</p><p>Note: StarOffice includes a kind of BASIC for macro and
script creation. This would have usable applications under Windows
but under Linux seems rather misplaced, given that C is the mother
tongue of Penguinese and Bash.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2472580.0x256ab88"></a>StarOffice Desktop</h2></div></div><p></p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4433f1.large.jpg"><img src="4433f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. StarOffice Desktop</p></div></div>
</p><p>It is cause for concern that, by default, the &ldquo;Integrated
Desktop&rdquo; option is enabled in StarOffice. A splash screen is
something common enough with applications run in a GUI environment.
A suite of applications taking over the desktop without the user's
knowledge (or choice) is something else entirely. However,
deselection of View --&gt; Integrated Desktop (or Ctrl-Shift-l)
will allow you to keep your chosen desktop and reduce the desktop
to an application-size window.</p><p>To get started, you will need to look for a vertical grey
arrow on the left-hand border of the desktop window. By opening
Click &amp; Go (see Figure 2) you will see a list of choices of
what you can do.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4433f2.large.jpg"><img src="4433f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Click &amp; Go</p></div></div>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2472580.0x256b160"></a>StarOffice Writer</h2></div></div><p>As mentioned, the word processor functions all seem to be
present and accounted for. Mercifully, there are some elements that
exist and can (once you've closed the &ldquo;correction&rdquo; windows) be
ignored, such as the tendency for the automatic spell checker to
write &ldquo;quantitative&rdquo;, when you were simply typing &ldquo;quantity&rdquo;.
The manual mentions &ldquo;streamlining routine formatting tasks&rdquo;,
which by all accounts involves turning on wordwrap as a default
setting and not indicating this to the user.</p><p>My personal bias against HTML editors was confirmed upon
attempting to draft a simple grey-on-black information page. SO 5.2
did not display the grey-on-black information page; it did display
a black-on-black information page, which may indicate a certain
independence of spirit to its creators but is hardly a useful
quality in web publication.</p><p>There are several formats supported by Writer, including Word
6.0, Rich Text Format and StarOffice's &ldquo;housebrand&rdquo; of text
formatting. ASCII is, thankfully, also supported&mdash;although you have
to confirm this choice when saving your document.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2472580.0x256b318"></a>StarOffice Mail and StarOffice
Discussion</h2></div></div><p>There are two ways to configure Mail and Discussion: you can
specify that the configuration parameters should be the same as
used in Netscape Messenger, and choose for the program to do this
automatically, or you can manually enter these parameters. As I'm
not altogether certain of the security risks involved in the first
choice, I've chosen to do this manually. You can bypass these
options by specifying &ldquo;Don't Use Internet&rdquo; with the click of a
mouse.</p><p>E-mail is a nice thing to be able to access whilst pounding
away on a recalcitrant document. Access you may, but replying to
that proton epistle is a wee bit more of a challenge than one might
wish, especially if &ldquo;Reply&rdquo; buttons/keystrokes are your custom.
If all else fails (and it will), right click. The same principles
apply to newsgroup-reading.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2472580.0x256b478"></a>StarOffice Impress and StarOffice Player</h2></div></div><p></p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4433f3.large.jpg"><img src="4433f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. StarOffice Impress and StarOffice
Player</p></div></div>
</p><p>Need to make a presentation to the board? Need to be able to
rehearse timings of slides and make the best impression you
can?</p><p>Both of these tools were surprisingly good. I'm no graphic
artist but still managed to get a little slide up in less than
seven minutes. Actual presentation makers could probably get the
whole presentation done in that time. As it was, I attempted to
make a few more &ldquo;slides&rdquo;, create a slide show, change the order,
etc., and view the results with Player. In terms of tools that are
designed for productivity, and not for messing about with
configuring/de-configuring options, these two applications
exemplify the ease of use the developers of other StarOffice
applications should be aiming for.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2472580.0x256b840"></a>Miscellaneous Information</h2></div></div><p>There are minor components of SO 5.2 that are interesting and
provide pleasant &ldquo;dressing&rdquo; to the office suite. Some of the clip
art is quite welldesigned. The Schedule is very nicely set up,
allowing the user to survey an entire week at a glance. Fonts, as
well as 2-D and 3-D effects, make for some eye-catching
products.</p><p>On 10/13/2000 (yes, a Friday) Sun made the code for
StarOffice 5.2 available for download
(<a href="http://openoffice.org" target="_self">http://openoffice.org/</a>).
It's worth noting that Sun is still retaining the copyright of the
project, regardless of who contributes what code or how much of the
code is completely rewritten.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2472580.0x256b9f8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>From what this writer has seen, three elements are missing
from Star Office 5.2: consistency, modularity and unity. There is
no consistent quality among the applications: some work very well
indeed, while others are &ldquo;not-yet-ready-for-prime-time&rdquo;.
Modularity would allow each application to run separately, as does
Player, and therefore give the user more direct control over what
s/he wants to run. Running everything from &ldquo;one place&rdquo; sounds
nice, but better results would arise out of an expanded context
menu than from a bulky pseudo-desktop, which is more visible and
serves less purpose than the menus concealed in its left
border.</p><p>An office suite is normally categorized as &ldquo;Productivity
Software&rdquo;. StarOffice 5.2 doesn't yet belong here.</p><p><a href="4433s1.html" target="_self">The Good/The Bad</a></p></div></div>
