the Microsoft Way, but I see little sense in it. A number of recent
converts want to get away from Microsoft for whatever reason, but
then expect everything to be done in the Microsoft way. I would
never even <span   class="emphasis"><em>mention</em></span> Microsoft except as a bad
example. Now I hear a cry for a Linux registry. Good grief, Charlie
Brown! This is one of the elements in Windows that causes more
problems than it solves. Why move simple, easy-to-read and edit
(okay, not always so simple to read) files out of /etc and cram
them into one large file that requires special tools to edit? I
vividly remember a promise that the Windows registry would never
have to be edited, that it was only for use by the system. To date,
I have never seen a Windows system that did not need the registry
edited. But I guarantee the learning curve on the files in /etc is
a lot less steep than the Windows registry. So before screaming for
changes, why not make sure that whatever changes are proposed are
changes for the better? Linux needs to improve, but a Linux
registry will not qualify as an improvement.
</p><p>Simple Document Management System:
<a href="http://sdms.cafuego.net" target="_self">http://sdms.cafuego.net/</a></p><p>This simple document management system is exactly what it
says it is: simple. It is simple to install and simple to use. I've
seen other document management systems, and while this one does not
seem to have all the flair of some others, it works exceedingly
well. The nicest part is that it uses a web browser. That document
you need that's halfway around the world is now accessible. Of
course, if it's a sensitive document, you'll want to use a secure
web server. It uses ACLs, so you can restrict who can do what with
the documents. Requires: MySQL, web server with PHP4 and MySQL
support, a web browser.</p><p>djpim:
<a href="http://www.tcomeng.com/djpim" target="_self">http://www.tcomeng.com/djpim/</a></p><p>This utility, called Daryl Jones' Personal Information
Manager (djpim), is a well-implemented web-based information
manager. It can be used for a number of things, including tracking
projects within a department. As a &ldquo;Personal Information Manager&rdquo;
it lacks an integrated calendar. You can pop up a small calendar in
two places, but it's not quite the same. Other than that, if you
need to be reminded of a list of tasks, this utility is
aesthetically pleasing and well organized. Requires: Web server
w/PHP and MySQL support, MySQL, a web browser.</p><p>Internal People Tracking System:
<a href="http://dev.wslogic.com/~anderson/ipts" target="_self">http://dev.wslogic.com/~anderson/ipts/</a></p><p>If you have folks scattered all over town, or worse, all over
the state, you can keep track of them with this little tool. You
might want to add or change some of the IN/OUT information provided
in the web page, but that's easily done. The most difficult part of
using IPTS is going to be making the employees use it. Requires:
MySQL, web server w/PHP and MySQL support, web browser, and Perl
modules: HTML::Template, CGI_Lite, DBI, and DBD::mysql.</p><p>pad:
<a href="http://www.lammah.com/pad" target="_self">http://www.lammah.com/pad/</a></p><p>If you have very sensitive data, you can use this utility to
break up the data into multiple, encrypted files. By putting each
resulting file on a different server and telling someone where to
find them, only someone with access to all the files can reassemble
them. No password is required to encrypt or decrypt, but it is
necessary to have all the required files intact. The only
disadvantage is that your storage requirements will, at a minimum,
double. Requires: libcrypt, libm, libc, libdl.</p><p>SafetyNet:
<a href="http://unixpimps.org/safetynet" target="_self">http://unixpimps.org/safetynet/</a></p><p>This shell script makes sure the services you want running at
all times continue to run. If they are not running, it restarts
them and sends you an e-mail. No more wondering if all the services
you need are running or not. If, for some reason, the service can't
be restarted, you'll see that in the e-mail message as well.
Requires: a Bourne shell, recommends cron.</p><p>slmon:
<a href="http://www.m00se.hsn.pl/slmon" target="_self">http://www.m00se.hsn.pl/slmon/</a></p><p>Just what we needed, another system performance monitor. But
wait, this one is a little different, and you might want to take a
second look at it. It boasts a couple different modes and supports
multiple CPUs for those fortunate enough to have them. You can see
a graph showing each CPU and its memory or view a histogram of each
CPU's load one at a time. Requires: libslang, glibc, libdl,
libm.</p><p>GtkPortFolio:
<a href="http://www.centercube.com/GtkPortFolio" target="_self">http://www.centercube.com/GtkPortFolio/</a></p><p>For all you market wizards out there, GtkPortFolio is a very
well-done quote downloader. It's easy to use. This is what is
really better termed userware. Want to add a symbol? No need to
edit files, just put the symbol in the Add Symbol box, and it will
be remembered. Don't know a symbol? Put the company's name in the
search box, and it will open Netscape and show you the symbol(s) it
found. It's about as simple as it comes. Requires: Perl, perl
modules: Gtk, Gtk::Gdk::ImlibImage, Finance::Quote,
Finance::YahooChart, Time::localtime, LWP::Simple.</p><p>nscache:
<a href="http://nscache.sourceforge.net" target="_self">http://nscache.sourceforge.net/</a></p><p>If you've ever used Netscape, you know how large the cache
can become. Or maybe you don't, but let me tell you it can get
<span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> large. This utility allows you to use a
GTK GUI to browse through your Netscape cache. You can select from
two views: tree view or sorted view. The sorted view allows you to
see the various entries sorted by URL (default), size, access time
or mime type. Both views allow you to delete any file in the list.
Now's your chance to dump some of those really large cached files.
Hit the sorted view, sort by size, scroll down to the bottom, right
click on your largest entries, select delete and recoup some space.
Requires: libdb, libgtk, libgdk, libgmodule, libglib, libdl,
libXext, libX11, libm, glibc.</p><p>Until next month.</p></div></div>
