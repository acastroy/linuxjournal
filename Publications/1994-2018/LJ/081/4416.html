    Ogg Vorbis is the Open-Source Community's hot alternative to
    MP3.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x277e580.0x2876500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Audio has become one of the killer apps
of the network. With the distribution power that the global network
offers, the music industry is being reshaped forever.
</p><p>The boom of audio applications and files on the Internet is
responsible for much current litigation surrounding copyright law
and music licensing. The record industry is just now figuring out
what most early users knew the first time they played an audio file
on their computer: it's a new world for artists, listeners and
record labels.</p><p>At the center of the upheaval are the technologies that make
it all possible and a new technology, Ogg Vorbis, is ready to put
this revolution into an even higher gear.</p><p>Ogg Vorbis is an open-source and patent-free audio codec that
is being developed by Xiphophorus along with several other
multimedia projects (cdparanoia and Icecast, to name two).
Xiphophorus is a collection of open-source, multimedia-related
projects and programmers who are working to ensure that Internet
multimedia standards reside in the public domain where they belong.
The work on Ogg Vorbis is currently funded by iCAST, the
entertainment arm of CMGI.</p><p>Ogg Vorbis is an open standard, and this is important for a
number of reasons. There are few truly open standards in the realm
of digital audio. Look at Windows Media, Quicktime or RealAudio.
These standards are all closed and proprietary, and because of
this, none of the standards interoperate well (or at all outside of
their corporate walls) with one another. When was the last time
that you could play Quicktime 4 in RealPlayer or vice versa? When
will Linux have Quicktime or Windows Media support? Linux and the
Internet are founded on open standards, and as multimedia on the
Internet and on Linux rapidly matures, the need for multimedia
applications like Ogg Vorbis grows rapidly as well.</p><p>There are two parts to Ogg Vorbis: Ogg and Vorbis. Ogg is a
wrapper format, similar in some ways to Apple's Quicktime or
Microsoft's Active Streaming Format. It helps you collect a group
of things that belong together. For example, if you have an Ogg
movie file, it might contain a Vorbis stream alongside a video
stream in another codec. Or the Ogg movie file might contain ten
Vorbis streams, one for each language available.</p><p>Vorbis is a codec that is written inside the Ogg framework.
It is a general-purpose audio codec that is suitable for
compressing most audio sources with good results. It doesn't use
subbanding like some codecs do, but it does use vector quantization
similar to others.</p><p>Vorbis is the only codec we've written so far, but not the
only one we plan to write. There also are Squish and Tarkin.</p><p>Squish is a lossless audio codec, meaning that there is no
loss in quality at all, and in fact, the decoded stream would be
byte-for-byte identical with the original stream. You might want to
use this for archiving master copies.</p><p>Tarkin is our fledgling video codec. It's a work in progress,
but I can tell you it's based on wavelets, not on the MDCT like
most modern codecs including MPEG-4 and JPEG. We're still playing
around with it, but it's quite promising.</p><p>Codecs are hard to develop. They take a lot of math skills
and a lot of time. Once you finish development, you still have to
tune it, fix bugs and think of cool new things to add. This is why
Ogg Vorbis focuses primarily on Vorbis and the Ogg framework at
this point.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x277e580.0x2876978"></a>What's Wrong with MP3?</h2></div></div><p>A lot of readers are probably wondering why we'd bother to
develop Ogg Vorbis with MP3 already enjoying such widespread use.
What's wrong with MP3? It's free, right? Wrong.</p><p>Have you ever noticed the amazing lack of free MP3 encoders,
especially considering how popular MP3 has become? I can count them
all on one hand. Some people will remember the famous letter from
Fraunhofer back in late 1997. The letter asked for all the
open-source and free MP3 encoders to cease and desist or start
paying patent royalties. There are around 12 patents on the
algorithms used by MP3, and all of them are heavily enforced by the
owner Fraunhofer.</p><p>This patent enforcement has several negative effects. It's
nearly impossible to have a free MP3 encoder because of the
licensing fees for doing so. It costs $2.50 per download ($5 if you
use the Fraunhofer code). Most of the free encoders disappeared
without a way to pay this kind of tribute. MusicMatch, which makes
a popular Windows encoder, sold a significant percentage of its
company to Fraunhofer in exchange for an unlimited license.</p><p>Fraunhofer can change their rules at anytime, too. Prior to
1997, distributing MP3 encoders was fine. Right now, broadcasting
in the MP3 format is free, but Fraunhofer stated that he intends to
charge licensing fees for such use at the end of this year.</p><p>The deals the RIAA cuts for the broadcasting of commercial
music are typically one-third to one-half a penny per song, which
is quite reasonable considering that Fraunhofer may want to charge
you 1% of revenue with a minimum of a full penny per song (these
are my extrapolations from the current fees on commercial MP3
downloads). Is MP3 really worth three times more than the music it
delivers?</p><p>It costs $.50 a copy to license a decoder. These aren't the
only costs associated with MP3, and really, some are just my
speculations (hopefully the real fee for broadcasting will be
considerably lower), but the patent holders can set or change the
licensing fees to whatever they want, anytime they want. And, they
already stated that they intend to do so at the end of this year
for broadcasting. The point isn't whether it's $15,000 or $5. The
point is they have the right to set the price however they see
fit.</p><p>MP3 is an old technology. Audiophiles and programmers have
been tuning encoders for a long time, but the technology is not
improving anymore. Even LAME, one of the best MP3 encoders around,
has new options that break the specification to try to squeeze more
quality out. There just isn't anymore room in the format for new
tweaks or improvements.</p><p>The alternatives aren't great either. Advanced Audio Coding
(AAC), which is a part of MPEG-4, has quite a bit more IP
restriction than MP3. There's more than one company involved in
most of the technologies, which makes licensing even more
cumbersome. The VQF format is locked up tightly by NTT and Yamaha.
RealNetworks and Microsoft aren't known for their open standards
either. Several derivative codecs like MP+ are problematic because
they face the same patent restrictions that the regular MP3 codec
has.</p><p>With all of these inherent problems and the need for a better
way to work with audio on the Internet, it's not surprising that a
solution would come from the Open-Source Community.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x277e580.0x2876d40"></a>Ogg Vorbis vs. MP3</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4416f1.large.jpg"><img src="4416f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Ogg Vorbis vs. MP3
</p></div></div><p>Ogg Vorbis is patent free and it was designed that way from
the beginning. There are no licensing fees or costs associated with
using the format for any purpose whether it is commercial or
noncommercial. It's also open source under terms of the LGPL, so
even the source code is free for companies and fellow
hackers.</p><p>It's not enough just to be free. Vorbis has superior sound
quality, which is what one would expect from a next-generation
audio codec. Due to an extendable format, Vorbis' quality will
improve for years to come without affecting decoders already being
used. Vorbis sounds great now, but the quality is nothing compared
to the Vorbis that will be around six months from now.</p><p>Quality is not the only advantage that Vorbis offers. Vorbis
has some unique technical features as well: extensible comments,
bitrate peeling and access to the raw codec packets.</p><p>Comments are defined in the format, so there are no worries
about ugly and limiting hacks like ID3 tagging. The comments are
stored in name=value pairs, and while there is a standard set of
comments for applications to comply with for often-used data, you
can add arbitrary comments if you need to.</p><p>Bitrate peeling allows for lowering the bitrate of a stream
or file on the fly without re-encoding. This is achieved by
encoding the most useful data toward the beginning of a packet.
Slimming the stream is simply a matter of chopping the tails off of
every packet before you send them out. Imagine listening to a radio
stream that changes the bitrate based on your personal bandwidth
needs. If you have dropouts, it sends you a smaller stream; if your
download finishes, it sends you more data.</p><p>For multicast or other special applications, access to raw
Vorbis packets allows complete control over how data is organized
and shuffled around.</p><p>And, there's no reason to put up with leading or trailing
silence since Vorbis has sample granularity on seek and decode.
Remember all those gaps between tracks on your favorite trance CD?
They disappear with Vorbis. Need to seek exactly to sample 303054?
Vorbis provides a mechanism to do this. This makes Vorbis well
suited to production work in ways that MP3 never was.</p><p>Developers and users, will appreciate having a high-quality
set of reference libraries. This means that not everyone who wants
to write an audio player needs to write their own decoder.
Developers also have more time to spend on other things besides
audio formats. This allows them to build more sophisticated and
useful software.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x277e580.0x2877268"></a>Current Status</h2></div></div><p>Two and a half years of Vorbis development (most of it as a
side project) finally brought us the Ogg Vorbis beta1 release in
mid-June of this year. It was limited to one bitrate, but it
already had plug-ins for most players as well as support on many
platforms.</p><p>In August, Ogg Vorbis beta2 release was launched at
LinuxWorld Expo in San Jose, California. Five bitrates from 128kbps
to 350KBps and several quality improvements were the main
features.</p><p>Right now we're rapidly approaching the beta3 release, which
has a number of significant quality improvements. This is mostly
due to the many pairs of ears that report artifacts and bugs. The
code has been organized toward the goal of a permanent API, and
several new tools have been added.</p><p>Several optimizations were made that resulted in the decoder
being twice as fast. We've also tuned the code to be tolerant for
those who implement Vorbis using integer-only math. This allows
hardware and embedded devices to more easily support Ogg Vorbis
playback.</p><p>We've had over 100,000 downloads of Ogg Vorbis in the three
months since its release, and third-party support has been
wonderful so far. Xmms, Freeamp and Kmpg already support Vorbis
playback (even popular Windows players like Sonique and Winamp
support Vorbis). LAME can now produce Ogg Vorbis files as well as
MP3 files and can re-encode MP3s to Vorbis in one step. Several
people reported success with Grip the CD ripper, and new
applications are popping up all the time.</p><p>A few content producers who are early adopters have started
to embrace the format as well. Vorbisonic.com and eFolkmusic.com
have Ogg Vorbis files up for download, and you can find more sites
listed on the
<a href="http://www.vorbis.com" target="_self">www.vorbis.com</a>
pages.</p><p>Shortly after our beta1 release, we did some random searches
for domain names with &ldquo;vorbis&rdquo; in them that showed that a lot of
people were buying Vorbis-related domain names. Several
Vorbis-related sites have already turned up, including govorbis.com
and vorbiszone.com.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x277e580.0x28775d8"></a>Where We Are Going</h2></div></div><p>We have only started the optimization process. On the
decoding side, Ogg Vorbis is nearly as fast as the current MP3
decoders and should catch up soon. Several people already claim
good playback on Pentium 120 machines. On the encoding side,
real-time encoding is already possible on fast Pentium IIs and
Pentium IIIs. Now that the API is getting stable and more features
are getting knocked out, more and more people have started to turn
to the issues of speed.</p><p>Comparing Vorbis to MP3 is almost unfair, since Vorbis has no
channel coupling, but we're still ahead. There are some tricky
patents that we must navigate, but the development team is looking
to Ambisonics to fill this gap. Ambisonics was patented, but the
patents have since expired. The company itself went out of business
due to stiff competition from Dolby. Ambisonics technology would
provide Vorbis with true three-dimensional, spherical sound, which
can be mapped onto any number of speakers&mdash;all this in only four
channels (one and two for stereo, three for surround and four for
spherical sound). Taking advantage of channel coupling should
easily drop bitrates by 40 percent.</p><p>Streaming is also very high on the list. We are currently
testing streaming and should have a few test stations up before
November. Soon after, Icecast should begin supporting Vorbis as its
primary format for audio. This gives Internet radio fans higher
quality streams, and it offers broadcasters a way out of
end-of-year broadcasting royalties.</p><p>For streaming, lower bitrates are vital. Right now the lowest
bitrate that the reference encoder outputs is approximately
128KBps. Typical streams range from 24KBps to 64KBps, and we'll
soon focus on the tuning necessary to make low bitrate Vorbis sound
fantastic. Lower sample rates are also on the horizon.</p><p>And, as always, we rigorously tune and improve the audio
quality by adding quality-enhancing features and eliminating
noticeable artifacts.</p><p>Ogg Vorbis 1.0, which includes the features outlined above,
should be completed by the time you read this.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x277e580.0x2877898"></a>Gaining Ground on MP3</h2></div></div><p>A lot of people ask us how we plan to take over the ground
MP3 has already claimed. Some people don't even think that it's
possible. I think it is. You can't really compare Vorbis to other
audio codecs that have tried to accomplish what we have, because no
other audio codec other than Vorbis is more free and more open than
MP3. Part of the reason that the MP3 movement succeeded was due to
the massive amounts of software that supported it. The software
support happened because there was code lying around all over the
Internet and documentation on how to use it or to write your own.
Some people compare MP3 versus Vorbis to VHS versus Betamax. They
say that just because we're technically superior doesn't that mean
we will win. I guess those people don't realize that VHS won
because the technology was actually more open.</p><p>Our strategy is to go after two groups: the artists and the
developers.</p><p>Artists, and other content producers need, Vorbis to avoid
paying percentages of their revenue to some technology company in
Germany. Most of these people are also interested in having the
best sounding quality product that they can get. People won't
choose Vorbis or MP3 files simply for the sake of technology.
People want music from artists they appreciate, or shows on topics
they like, and they want the music to be available, transferable
and easy to manipulate.</p><p>Developers want to include audio in their software&mdash;and not
just for decoding and playback. Rich-media creation tools are only
possible in the open-source world with open-media standards and
patent-free algorithms like Ogg Vorbis. Including Vorbis into
software is easy (it takes little time for a programmer to write a
playback plug-in even if they are new to Vorbis and the Vorbis
plug-in API).</p><p>If there is content being produced in Vorbis and applications
all support Vorbis, the user probably won't even notice. Ease of
use is achieved with transparency. Years from now, we might still
be calling on-line music &ldquo;MP3&rdquo; just as some people still call
making photocopies &ldquo;Xeroxing&rdquo;, but the technology will come from
different sources.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x277e580.0x2877b00"></a>How You Can Help</h2></div></div><p>Just like any open-source project, Vorbis reaches its full
potential only with the help of the community. Programmers,
audiophiles, musicians and evangelists are all needed. Encode some
music with Vorbis, listen to Vorbis files and let us know if you
hear anything that isn't in the original. Artifacts, once someone
identifies them, are usually easily fixed. If you currently have a
project that could (or does) play or encode audio, try Vorbis. Not
only will the audience for Vorbis grow, but users will appreciate
the functionality that Vorbis offers. Instead of creating music and
putting it on-line in MP3, do it in Vorbis. By producing Vorbis
files, you avoid limitations that patent holders enforce, and you
increase user demand for Vorbis. Tell your friends, family and
coworkers about Vorbis. Any effort to promote open standards like
Vorbis for Internet audio is time well spent. And at this infant
stage in Vorbis' life, we could really use the help.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x277e580.0x2877c08"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Open standards for Internet multimedia are a worthwhile and
attainable goal, especially with a high-quality open-source audio
codec such as Vorbis.</p><p>Just as HTTP, FTP, TCP/IP and other open standards helped
change the landscape for networking, our goal is to change the face
of multimedia with tools that sound better, look better and work
together better than the closed or patent-encumbered alternatives.
You most likely use an operating system that relies on open
standards and open source at its very core; why not expect the same
from the multimedia applications you use?</p><p>Please visit the Ogg Vorbis demonstration site at
