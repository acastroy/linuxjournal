    Linley explores the potential for Home Networks.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca8580.0xda04a8"></a></h2></div></div><p> Although home networks are merely geek
chic today, new products are emerging to help drive them into the
mainstream. These new devices, many based on Linux, will drive an
explosion of interest in home networks in affluent, but not
necessarily tech-oriented, households. As in any revolution,
however, various players are each pushing their own visions of how
the technology will work, creating conflicting information for
potential customers.
</p><p>Many important vendors recently created the Internet Home
Alliance to help promote home networks. These vendors include
diverse players such as networking giants Cisco Systems, Sun
Microsystems and 3Com; consumer-focused companies Best Buy,
CompUSA, Panasonic and Sears; and chip makers Motorola and Texas
Instruments. Although these vendors are working together, each of
them is trying to solve a particular problem: sharing a broadband
connection, for example, or creating a music network (see &ldquo;Linley
on Linux&rdquo;, page 186 of October 2000). Indeed, many early efforts
will be single-purpose networks driven by a particular vendor's
solution. Once home networking becomes established, however, there
will be many new uses. For example, the TiVo DVR (digital TiVo
video recorder) does an excellent job of storing TV programs on its
hard drive for later viewing. But there is no practical way to
record programs between two televisions in different rooms. A home
network would allow a single DVR to drive video streams to multiple
televisions.</p><p>Ultimately, I expect the home network to look much like the
network in a small office, with a single server connected to a
number of clients. The server will have two main components: the
residential gateway and the storage server.</p><p>Many vendors are touting their expertise in residential
gateways, but few are available today. These devices are similar to
WAN gateways, connecting the internal home LAN to the Internet,
typically through a broadband connection such as DSL or cable
modem. Unlike a standard broadband modem, however, the residential
gateway has a LAN interface to distribute data to multiple
clients.</p><p>The storage server will consist of a processor, network
connection and one or more hard drives, providing data storage for
all devices in the home. This server could back up the hard drives
of any PC in the home; store digital photographs, music and video;
and stream audio or video content to any network client. It should
be programmable enough that it can host applications, such as TiVo,
that autonomously obtain broadband content or perform other
housekeeping functions.</p><p>Client devices include PCs, Macs and Linux systems that use
the residential gateway to access the Internet and use the storage
server to back up important files or simply as shared data storage
(ideally, the storage server should use a RAID design so the
inevitable hard-drive failure does not eliminate vital data).
Photographs or music files can be created on a PC or downloaded
from the Internet, then transferred to the storage server.</p><p>Once on the storage server, a photograph can be displayed on
any TV screen or monitor in the house via a simple video client. A
video client has only a processor, a network interface and a video
output. The client downloads an image from the storage server,
decompresses it and displays it. The video client also downloads
and displays a video stream from the server. Similarly, an audio
client connected to an amplifier and speakers can play any music
file on the storage server. The audio client has a similar bill of
materials as the video client. Either client should sell for less
than $100 in high volume, making it cost-effective to have several
throughout the house.</p><p>Other potential network clients are Internet appliances,
non-PC devices that have a web browser and e-mail. Video games
connect to the network to enable multiplayer gaming. Even
appliances such as refrigerators and thermostats might connect to
the home network to share usage information and operate more
efficiently.</p><p>This architecture centralizes the storage and main compute
resources in the storage server, where disk space can be shared
efficiently and upgraded easily using internal or external
drives&mdash;&ldquo;Honey, can you pick up a few gigabytes on the way home?&rdquo;
Initially, single-function products such as TiVo and AudioReQuest
will employ their own hard drives, but these units will ultimately
give way to low-cost thin client devices.</p><p>Linux is likely to play a key role in this growing network of
consumer products. The storage server in particular needs a robust
but inexpensive operating system with built-in networking
capabilities. Since the storage server is likely to run more
complicated applications that organize and manage audio, video and
web content, it needs a platform with good software-development
tools and standards. Linux is an ideal fit.</p><p>The residential gateway may be a simple networking device,
but it is likely to run a firewall and perhaps other software as
well. Linux may play a role here. Some of the client devices may
run embedded Linux as well; the key issue here is maintaining a
small memory footprint for reduced cost. Certainly, Linux is a good
choice for Internet appliances with web browsers.</p><p>One concern with home networks is the choice of physical
connection. The most cost-effective choice today is to use a home's
existing phone wiring (HPNA). I don't see this as a good long-term
solution, because most homes, particularly outside of the US, don't
have enough phone jacks. The long-term winner is likely to be a
wireless solution such as 802.11. The 802.11b standard provides
enough bandwidth for several audio streams but only one video
stream. The forthcoming 802.11a version is needed for multiple
simultaneous video streams.</p><p>In the short-term, these two media, as well as power-line
networking (HPPA), will slug it out, creating confusion in the
market. The solution is to support two or all three standards in
the residential gateway, creating a mixed-mode LAN compatible with
clients of different types. This method will increase the cost of
the gateway but ease consumer concerns.</p><p>As these problems are resolved and costs begin to drop, home
networks will flourish. Some studies project that more than
one-third of US homes will have a broadband Internet connection by
2004. These homes will be prime candidates for home networks. As
music, photos and video all become compressed digital files, the
advantages of a home network will become clear. The growth of home
networks will create opportunities for new Linux-based devices,
such as residential gateways and storage servers.</p></div></div>
