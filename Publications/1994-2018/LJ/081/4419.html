    &ldquo;Show me the Linux!&rdquo; you say? Embedded Linux-based
    technology is closer than you think.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29fb580.0x2af3608"></a></h2></div></div><p>People keep asking, &ldquo;All this talk about
Embedded Linux taking off like a rocket sounds great, but are any
real companies using Embedded Linux in real products? And, if so,
when do these Embedded Linux-based products start hitting the
market?&rdquo;
</p><p>The answer is &ldquo;You bet they're designing Embedded Linux into
real products! Lots of 'em!&rdquo; As for when these products start
shipping to customers, some are already being delivered in large
quantities, and many more are in varying stages of development.
Bear in mind, the gestation cycle of most new product-development
projects is roughly nine to twelve months, whereas Embedded Linux
itself has only just begun to see widespread interest in the past
twelve months. If you do the math based on those two assumptions,
you'll quickly realize that the rollout of Embedded Linux-based
products ought to be starting right about now and is expected to
pick up momentum toward the end of this year.</p><p>Although <i  >Linux Journal</i> and others have
covered a number of consumer-oriented, Embedded Linux-based devices
through news announcements, preview stories and product reviews,
many design projects are, for obvious reasons, conducted beneath a
cloak of secrecy. As you can imagine, suppliers of Embedded Linux
are fond of saying, &ldquo;We really wish we could tell you about some
of the exciting products we've been designed into, but we're under
nondisclosures that prevent us from talking about them.&rdquo;</p><p>Here, then, is a brief rundown on many of the Embedded
Linux-based, consumer-oriented devices that have been disclosed
publicly. Bear in mind that the list below represents merely the
tip of the Embedded Linux iceberg, as it were.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29fb580.0x2af3870"></a>PDAs</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Samsung Yopy PDA</b></span>--The Yopy
