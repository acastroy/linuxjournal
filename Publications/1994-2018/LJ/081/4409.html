Figure 1.The SuSE Linux 7.0 Package
</p></div></div><p>The SuSE Linux 7.0 Package is the &ldquo;other&rdquo; OS for my CAD
work. I had a 6GB drive available, so I pulled the other drive and
dropped this one in. This is just being overly cautious, I never
know when I'll get a call and need to run that &ldquo;other&rdquo; OS, and I
need to be able to get back up ASAP. I did another install before
this one, and the installer does recognize and offer to setup LILO
for other OSes. The machine is a Pentium 166 with 80MB RAM. I went
into the BIOS set up, re-scanned for the new HD and set the boot
options to boot from CD.</p><p>This brought me to a text-based screen that said &ldquo;Have a Lot
of Fun!&rdquo; and then proceeded into a normal kernel boot, scanning
for devices, etc. One addition I noticed was the kernel scanning
for braille devices&mdash;a nice touch. In fact, the box says SuSE Linux
is entirely suitable for use by the blind. I also noticed that
software RAID support is included in the provided kernel. I
recently implemented this at a client's site, and it has worked out
quite nicely, with two drives in a RAID 1 array for a redundant,
mirrored system.</p><p>From the initial boot, the screen went blank, the speaker
emitted a beep and that was it! At this point, according to the
install, I should have been in YaST2, the SuSE graphical installer.
Apparently I have issues with my video card, an ATI Mach64-based
card. The notes in the CD folder mention typing &ldquo;manual&rdquo; at the
LILO prompt for expert installation with YaST1, so I reboot and try
this route, and the install goes into YaST1. This time I get to a
&ldquo;dialog&rdquo;, text-based install that asks my preferred language and
proceeds to the option of a text-based YaST (see Figure 1), or
graphical YaST2 (see Figure 2). I decide to live dangerously and
try YaST2. This time I do get to the graphical interface, a little
grainy at 800x600, but functional. So far, no mouse, but I can tab
through the options, and it gets me to a screen where I can select
my mouse type and port. Now we are off and running. Next we get to
the keyboard layout and time zone, after which I am asked whether I
want to upgrade or do a fresh install. I choose the fresh install.
Next we have a choice of installs:</p><p>

<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4409f3.large.jpg"><img src="4409f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. YaST2</p></div></div>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Almost Everything</p></li><li><p>Minimal</p></li><li><p>Default</p></li><li><p>Default with Office</p></li><li><p>Detailed Selection.</p></li></ul></div><p>I choose Default with Office so I can appraise what gets
installed by default.
</p><p>Next I'm asked where I would like LILO to be installed and go
with the suggested <b  >/dev/hda</b>.... Then I
personalize the installation with my first name, last name, login
and password, and lastly, the root password I would like to
use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xadc580.0xbd5688"></a>Partitioning</h2></div></div><p>The default partitioning scheme sets up just three
partitions: <b  >/boot,</b> / and swap. I back up and opt
for custom partitioning, which allows me to choose between ext2 and
ReiserFS. I set up <b  >/</b> and
<b  >/boot</b>, <b  >/usr</b> and
<b  >/home</b>. The install gives you an option at this
point to save your settings to floppy so, in case there is a
problem, you can get back into where you left off.</p><p>While we're on partitioning, I should mention a little about
ReiserFS. This is a relatively new journaling file system for Linux
that boasts certain improvements over the standard ext2 file
system. Journaling, if you're not familiar with database systems,
implies that each file system transaction is written to a journal
or log. It's possible to replay this journal in the event of a
catastrophe and recover the lost transactions. The journal is
flushed periodically once it is certain the transactions have
actually taken place.</p><p>Here's the freshmeat.net entry on reiserfs:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>reiserfs is a revolutionary new approach to file
system design which stores not just file names but the files
themselves in a B*-tree. It is a generation ahead of alternatives
that use older, plain B-tree technology and that cannot store the
files themselves in the tree.</p></blockquote></div><p>Since I have some extra space on this drive, and don't quite
know what to expect with ReiserFS at this point, I set up duplicate
<b  >/home</b> and <b  >/usr</b> partitions,
one with ext2 and one with ReiserFS. The chart below shows the
layout I came up with:
</p><p>/ 1GB ext2 /boot 7.8MB ext2/usr 1.5GB ReiserFS/usr2 1.5GB
ext2/home 900MB ReiserFS/home2 900MB ext2swap 160MB</p><p>I'll cover more on ReiserFS later in the article, once we
have things installed and set up.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xadc580.0xbd5c60"></a>Package Installation</h2></div></div><p>The partitions are set up, and we move to the installation of
341 packages. As the install progresses, you get a typical status
screen displaying the package name being installed, a short
description, and an overall progress update and percentage of disk
space consumed. The installation I selected uses a little over 1GB
of space.</p><p>At 242 packages, I am informed that the LILO boot sector has
been set up, and I can restore the old one with the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
lilo -u /dev/hda
</pre><p>Then the installer starts the new system, and a text screen
tells me the base system has been successfully installed. The
graphical YaST2 continues, asking for CD2, then resumes installing
packages. Another pause at package 326, and I'm asked for CD3.
Another pause at 331 for CD4.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xadc580.0xbcc700"></a>X Setup</h2></div></div><p>Now we move on to X set up. I am asked for my monitor, a Mag
MX17, and then the video card, which it correctly identifies as an
ATI and sets for 1240x1168@16bpp. I try the test at this
resolution, my color palette shifts to an unusual look and the
system appears to lock up. I can't switch to a different VT, nor
does CTL-ALT-Backspace or CTL-ALT-DEL have any effect, so I resort
to the reset button. The system boots into SuSE and runs checks on
the file systems since it wasn't shut down properly, then gets me
back into YaST2 at the monitor configuration. This was nice. Even
though I hit a major problem, the install recovered and resumed
where I left off. This time I try a more conservative setting,
640x480@8bpp&mdash;and get a black screen and another lockup. Hmm. Seems
the ATI driver has a problem with my card. There is no option to
override with a generic SVGA card, so I opt for no X11 and move on.
The install does tell me I can set X up later with SaX.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xadc580.0xbcc808"></a>Peripherals/Networking</h2></div></div><p>From here, YaST2 moves on to setting up the printers, sound,
Internet and network. I do not have a modem on this machine, and
YaST2 tells me it has not detected a modem or ISDN adapter. It does
recognize my Creative sound card and my 3Com NIC. I go ahead and
set up my IP address with the default gateway through my file
server and a host name with DNS pointing to my ISP's name servers.
The install checks to certify that I have entered valid IP
addresses.</p><p>YaST2 tells me the NIC was configured correctly and
networking is set up, which I verify by pinging the box from my
file server. Looks good!</p><p>The sound card setup allows me to set the volume and test,
and it plays a nice little orchestral piece&mdash;good again! Later on I
look at the loaded modules, and it looks like sound is handled by
ALSA.</p><p>For printing, I have an HP print server on the LAN with a NEC
Silentwriter and an HP Deskjet 693C. The installer scanned the
local LAN for hosts and failed to find anything, probably because
I'm not running DNS on the server. Since I have a custom lpr script
on the server that powers up my printers via an X10 control module
when I need to print, I route the print jobs to the file server,
using its IP address, and it takes care of the filtering too. One
minor annoyance here is the first network printer is called
&ldquo;remote&rdquo; with no opportunity to override that name except on the
second printer. I would rather have preferred setting it to
something more descriptive.</p><p>That was it on this screen, so I moved on to &ldquo;Finish
Installation&rdquo;, and was told I could log in as &ldquo;stew&rdquo;. The manual
reminds you to change your BIOS settings back to boot from hard
drive and/or floppy.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xadc580.0xbcca70"></a>First Login</h2></div></div><p>I log in, do a <b  >ps -ax</b> to see what is
running&mdash;looks normal enough, httpd, lpd and several copies of
nscd, which the man pages tell me is a name server caching
d&aelig;mon&mdash;okay. <b  >lynx localhost</b> gets me to
some local SuSE pages&mdash;good. My server is on line, so I try lynx on
some remote web pages, and they come up too. Looks like networking
is working fine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xadc580.0xbccc28"></a>Back to X Setup</h2></div></div><p>I take a quick visit to the SuSE web site and search their
support database to see if I see anything on my X issues, but the
info seems to refer only to SuSE6.4 and older versions, so I forge
ahead on my own.</p><p>To see if I could pick up anything on my X issues I do
an</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -q -a | grep mach
</pre><p>from the command line. I see the following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
xmach64-3.3.6-44
</pre>


This explains my problems since YaST2 was trying to use the
XFree4.0 server. Doing a similar search on xf
<pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -q -a | grep xf86
xf86-4.0-55
xf86_3x-3.3.6-44
</pre>


It looks like sticking with XFree3.3.6 would be the wise thing to
do. I log out and re-log in as root to finish setting things up.
</p><p>I was able to run SaX from the command line and correctly
configure XFree3.3.6 by manually choosing my ATI video card, an
Xpression card. Then I was able to fine tune the settings and get
it set up for 1024x768@16bpp. The card is an older card with only
2MB VRAM, so this is about as good as it gets. Running
<span   class="bold"><b>startx</b></span>, I am in the KDE desktop.
SaX uses XFree 3.3.6 vs. SaX2, which uses XFree4.0.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xadc580.0xbccf98"></a>Running X</h2></div></div><p>Okay, now we can run <span   class="bold"><b>startx</b></span>
and get into X, which defaults to the KDE desktop environment. I
run the KDE control panel and try some of the settings. System
sounds are disabled by default, and I notice that none of the
default KDE sounds are associated with their actions. I set up the
associations and enable sound, and they work as expected. I also
tried an audio CD with KSCD, and it plays as expected, as did an
MP3 I grabbed off my file server.</p><p>The rest of the KDE settings for colors, desktop, etc., are
the same as those with which I'm familiar in other distributions.
This is KDE 1.1.2, not the version 2 that everyone is talking
about, although the beta comes on the SuSE 7.0 CDs.</p><p>If you prefer different Window managers or desktop
environments, those are included too. I did not see the switchdesk
application, common on Red Hat-based systems. When you have X
working though, you can enable the graphical login kdm via YaST.
Once this is done you have a choice of KDE, Windowmaker, twm or
fvwm2. An interesting tool is DyDe (see Figure 3), a SuSE dynamic
desktop configurator, that allows you to mix-and-match window
managers and desktop environments on the fly. Once I went back into
YaST2 and installed them, GNOME, Enlightenment, Sawmill and Xfce
were also available.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4409f4.large.jpg"><img src="4409f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Dynamic Desktop Configurator
</p></div></div><p>I was pleasantly surprised to find a new version of the GIMP,
version 1.2 prerelease when I went to do the screenshots for the
article. The GIMP is the favorite graphics tool of most Linux
users, and it looks like the new version adds some nice features.
Xsane was also installed by default and works nicely with my HP
ScanJetIICX.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xadc580.0xbcd3b8"></a>The Kernel</h2></div></div><p>The kernel version installed is 2.2.16, although the box
claims 2.2.17-pre. Looking on the CD, it looks like source is there
for version 2.2.16 as well as an assortment of precompiled modules
in <b  >/lib/modules/2.2.16</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xadc580.0xbcd518"></a>User Login</h2></div></div><p>Logging in as a normal user, the KDE desktop is set up with
icons for Netscape, StarOffice and icons for both my CD and CDR, my
Zip drive and Bernoulli drive. You are also greeted with a SuSE
welcome screen (see Figure 4). Clicking the StarOffice icon
launches the StarOffice 5.2 Workstation installation, which lets
you do an individual install for each user. This only requires
1.6MB of space per user in their home directories. StarOffice still
uses their Star Desktop work space, but I understand that they will
be breaking the applications up in the open-source version to come.
With Netscape 4.73 up and running, I initiated a call to the
Internet from my server and successfully navigated to the SuSE web
site, so my gateway setup is working. The local Apache server
launches a cute page with links to local documentation, as well as
SuSE's site (see Figure 5).</p><p>

</p><p>Even after all these years, pine is still my e-mail reader of
choice, and there it was, like an old friend, along with fetchmail.
If you go for the GUI e-mail programs, kmail and Netscape messenger
are installed by default with many more on the CDs.</p><p>There's also an alternate file manager for KDE&mdash;kruiser,
which is an MS Explorer-style file browser.</p><p>On the commercial applications side, there are an assortment
of free and demo versions including VMware, ADABAS D Personal
Edition, Arkeia Backup, Lutris Enhydra, Hummingbird Exceed and Via
Voice.</p><p>I won't go into all of the packages installed or on the CD,
or this would turn into a SuSE 7.0 supplement. Suffice it to say
with the wealth of applications provided, I don't think you will be
needing to go to freshmeat or rpmfind for a while.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xadc580.0xbcdba0"></a>ReiserFS Tests</h2></div></div><p>Since the journaling aspect of ReiserFS seems to be what
everyone talks about, and this system is essentially virginal, I
decided to do a completely unscientific test. I backed out of X,
reverting to the graphical kdm login, then switched to VT1, logging
in as root, typed &ldquo;sync&rdquo; to sync the file system and did the
unthinkable&mdash;hit the power switch. As you might expect, when I
booted back up, the kernel notes that the file system was not
closed out properly and proceeds to run fsck on the ext2
partitions. For the <b  >/usr2</b> and
<b  >/home2</b>, at 1.5GB and 900MB, this takes 20-40
seconds each and recovers without any serious issues. Remember, I
did do a sync, which flushes the disk cache buffers. For
<b  >/usr</b> and <b  >/home</b>, which are
ReiserFS, the kernel runs reiserfsck, and it completes two to seven
journaled entries in one second and moves on&mdash;nice! Just for
laughs, I repeated this test a couple of times with and without
syncing, with similar results. Don't use this as your first line of
defense for catastrophic failure, but it does look like a good way
to get up and running quickly in case of such an emergency.</p><p>The messages I read on the Net talked of speed issues in
using ReiserFS instead of ext2. To get a look at this, I downloaded
bonnie from freshmeat.net and ran a couple of tests. In both cases,
I was the only one logged into the system via Telnet with kdm
running but no X session. All the rest of the system d&aelig;mons
were those running by default.</p><p><a href="4409l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>On the single 200M file there did not seem to be much
difference. On the 30 files tested, it looks like ReiserFS does
have a bit of a cost in terms of speed, looking at the /sec
readings. Again, this is not exactly a controlled, scientific test,
although I did run the tests a second time with similar results. I
also ran them as root, so it did not seem to be a permissions
issue. In actual use, I did not notice any performance hitch in
running applications. Whether you want to go for the speed of ext2
or the safety of journaling is up to you. I'll leave ReiserFS
running on this system for a while.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xadc580.0xbcdf68"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>In summary, it looks like SuSE 7.0 Professional has most of
what Linux users want in a distribution and then some. The
&ldquo;Default with Office&rdquo; had almost everything I would want in a
desktop system. All of my hardware was detected and set up except
my IDE-CDR, which would require a kernel recompile to burn CDs with
it. I did have the initial problem with my ATI video card and
YaST2, but the install had a workaround for this. I did not call
SuSE support, but the package includes 90 days of installation
support via telephone, e-mail and fax. SuSE's web-based support
database is pretty comprehensive as well, although apparently 7.0
is still too new to have many entries. I recently did a 6.4 install
on my iMac, and several of the issues I had there were covered in
the database. If you are accustomed to a Red Hat-based
distribution, some of the configuration tools and file locations,
as well as the init scripts are a little different, but not a big
issue in my book. For the $69.95 US they are asking at SuSE Shop,
it's a steal compared to some other OSes.</p></div></div>
