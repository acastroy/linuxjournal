was initially struck by the number of warning labels visible, each
proclaiming such things as &ldquo;Violent Subject Matter&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Animated Blood and Gore&rdquo;. And who can forget &ldquo;Low-Violence
Installation Option Included&rdquo;. Inside, the CD-case itself was also
littered with these warnings; clearly, this game has some
self-esteem issues. Without reading the manual, I loaded up the
software, started the game and was met with the main menu screen.
Yet even <span   class="emphasis"><em>more</em></span> warnings here (I was up to about
nine at this point), including a scrolling text window at the
bottom of the main menu whose message informed me of the game's
&ldquo;MA&rdquo; rating and even how to access the parental controls in an
appropriate menu. The net effect of all these warnings was perhaps
the opposite of their intention; I felt a distinct urge to see what
the heck these people were going on about.</p><p>I started up the first level. After a short introductory
movie, I was in the thick of it, heading down a hallway to stop
some terrorist bad guys and free their hostages. About three steps
into the hall, the first bad guy swung out, leveling his pistol at
me. I aimed the shotgun for a leg shot, hoping to be a nice guy.
Boom! The shot cleanly REMOVED his leg and blew the detached
portion a few feet behind him, leaving not only a bloody stump with
an exposed femur and jetting arterial spray, but also producing a
terrifically realistic scream of pain and agony from my would-be
assassin as he slid to the floor clutching his bloody stump and
literally <span   class="emphasis"><em>moaning</em></span> for a few moments before his
virtual life ended. I leaned back away from the keyboard slightly
with an audible, &ldquo;whoa&rdquo;. After a short pause, a slow grin crept
across my lips. &ldquo;This is going to be interesting.&rdquo; Indeed it
was.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ba580.0x26b2d40"></a>The Story</h2></div></div><p>The story for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Soldier of Fortune</em></span> is a
sort of evil twist on the Rainbow Six story line. You're John
Mullins, a mercenary of the highest caliber (no pun intended), who
works on the darker side of the counter-terrorism world. You're on
the team the good guys call when they want their dirty deeds done
dirt cheap. The bad guys, a fanatical terrorist organization
hell-bent on mass destruction, have seized some nukes.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Soldier of Fortune</em></span> takes you on a series of
missions against this organization and its leader to recover or
destroy the nukes before they can be used against the world. Each
mission is worth a specified amount of money, payable upon
successful completion and leads to the next mission in some way,
perhaps giving clues about where the next mission should be,
etc.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4381f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Your Partners: &ldquo;Hawk&rdquo; Parsons and Sam Gladstone
</p></div></div><p>Unfortunately, as much as this description would seem to
indicate that there is a fluid plot with specific goals, pieces to
fit together and money to earn and accumulate, there really isn't.
The plot itself is about as deep as a Dr. Seuss book and only
randomly seems to interject coherent story line ties. The good news
is that it's okay. It's a first-person shooter; we don't expect
much of a plot, just a clear shot to the next bad guy and a general
sense that we're getting somewhere. I admit, I kept waiting for the
&ldquo;hook&rdquo; in the story line, the weird twist at the end that would
have made it all the more interesting. When it did predictably
arrive, it was a letdown, mainly because of the lack of plot
development leading up to it. The aspect that you're getting paid
for all this killing only enters into the game in the most
tangential of ways, and no matter how much you make, you really
don't get anything from the cash that you wouldn't get normally.
You either win the mission and get the cash, or you play the
mission until you win the mission and get the cash so you can
continue to the next mission. Again, the good news is that once you
start playing, the game is fun enough that you don't care.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ba580.0x26b3108"></a>The Game</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Soldier of Fortune</em></span> is, if nothing else,
rather detailed in the blood-n-gore department. It uses Raven's
proprietary rendering system, appropriately called GHOUL, to
deliver what Raven calls &ldquo;Bolt-on Gore&rdquo;. Using GHOUL (which also
provides a number of lighting, texture, network and modeling
enhancements) <span   class="emphasis"><em>Soldier of Fortune</em></span>'s programmers
were able to create individual characters that can react
differently based on weapon impacts in any of 26 discrete &ldquo;Gore
Zones&rdquo;. Shoot someone in the foot, they hop around for a moment
yelping in pain. Shoot someone in the throat, they grasp at their
throat, gurgle, and fall to the floor. They don't always die,
however. I walked around one room for five minutes trying to figure
out where a soft slurping sound was coming from only to find that
one of my targets was on the floor, alive, yet gurgling softly
through a hole in his throat. Nice touch. You can even shoot the
gun from someone's hands if your aim is good enough. Parents fear
not; all the really nasty stuff in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Soldier of
Fortune</em></span> can be controlled via the parental controls by
disabling and password-protecting such things as Damage Skins,
Blood, Death Animations, Dismembered Limbs (my favorite) and
so-called Adult Textures (which mainly deals with the adult
language used in the dialogue subtitles.)</p><p>Though the gory details are very cool, gamers expecting
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Rainbow Six</em></span>-type combat reality are likely to
be disappointed with the rather <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span>-like
feel of the rest of the game. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Soldier of
Fortune</em></span> actually runs on a slightly hacked version of
the Quake II engine, and you can feel some of that old blockiness
in the game environment. However, Raven has done some really nice
work in creating interesting levels, and some especially sick and
twisted levels. Most levels are littered with the typical
&ldquo;unlikely FPS props&rdquo; such as doors that open with the push of a
big red button, first-aid boxes or conveniently located ventilation
system crawl spaces. The feel of the game is a bit <span   class="emphasis"><em>Duke
Nukem</em></span>-like (you'll see yourself twirling a gun on your
finger casually as you walk along, for instance) and even at
moderate levels of difficulty, the level of combat proficiency of
the AI characters you fight could probably be eclipsed by that of a
two-year-old in a temper tantrum. That said, all these aspects
actually work in concert to make a first-person shooter that is,
quite simply, incredibly fun to play.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4381f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ba580.0x26b3688"></a>Multiplayer</h2></div></div><p>I found the multiplayer environment to be great
entertainment. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Soldier of Fortune</em></span>'s
multiplayer games betray its <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span> heritage
and no cooperative multiplayer modes exist. The favorites are
there, like standard <span   class="emphasis"><em>Deathmatch</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Capture the Flag</em></span>, along with a couple new
types: &ldquo;Arsenal&rdquo; where random weapons are assigned to you by the
computer and you must score a kill with each of your weapons;
&ldquo;Assassin&rdquo; where you must kill a specific player and defend
yourself against players who are assigned to specifically kill you;
and &ldquo;Realistic&rdquo;, a multiplayer type where weapons do realistic
damage to arms and legs, and medkits repair specific body parts
(fixing your legs so you can run again, or your arm so you can aim
again, etc.). Like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SOF</em></span>'s multiplayer mode seems to warp space and
time, shrinking what originally appears to be a long, boring
evening into a short series of endless multiplayer levels and
countless virtual homicides.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ba580.0x26b39a0"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Loki, as usual, did a spectacular and totally seamless job
porting <span   class="emphasis"><em>Soldier of Fortune</em></span> to Linux.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SOF</em></span> does require a 3-D accelerated video card
and uses Mesa/OpenGL to support 3-D hardware acceleration. Loki
lists the Voodoo Banshee, Voodoo2, Voodoo3, G200, G400, RIVA TNT
and TNT2, and the GeForce 256 as supported chip sets. I had no real
difficulty getting the software to install cleanly on a standard VA
Linux Systems 6.2.3 load (a Red Hat 6.2-based system) with a Matrox
G400, or on my Debian (woody) system with the XFree4 CVS tree and a
GeForce GTS. The footprint of the install is a bit hefty (about
700MB for the full install, which is the only option) and comes
with both text and graphical install modes. Loki's minimums include
glibc 2.1, a 2.2.x series kernel and an OSS-compliant sound card
and driver. Obviously, if you want multiplayer games, you'll need a
network card and either TCP/IP or IPX support (for LAN games)
enabled in your kernel. Joysticks are supported. Minimum box
hardware, according to Loki, is 64MB RAM, and a Pentium II
processor; I had very nice performance on both a 400MHz PII and a
550MHz PIII, each with 128MB system RAM.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ba580.0x26b3b58"></a>In Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>I'd have to say that I totally dig <span   class="emphasis"><em>Soldier of
Fortune</em></span>. It's fun. It's got character. It's definitely
not afraid to get in your face. Most of the things I found lacking
in it also are the things that make it such a great first-person
shooter game. Did I mention how fun it is? If you're looking for
some middle ground between <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Rainbow Six</em></span>, this is probably your
game.</p></div></div>
