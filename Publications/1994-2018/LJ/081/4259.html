<a href="http://ragingsearch.altavista.com" target="_self">http://ragingsearch.altavista.com/</a>),
there are only 50,665 web pages containing the words &ldquo;my cat&rdquo;,
but 57,615 instances of &ldquo;streaming media&rdquo;. This is not the Web we
thought we knew. As people put bigger, fancier media on the Net
instead of just pictures of Mittens, you might think that we would
have learned the lesson of the humble GIF file: don't make human
communication depend on a patent license.
</p><p>But people <span   class="emphasis"><em>didn't</em></span> learn it, and we're in
for another patent mess with the patented MP3 format and several
others. As I write this, I'm checking out the mp3licensing.com page
about Broadcasting/Streaming (see
<a href="http://www.mp3licensing.com/royalty/broadcast.html" target="_self">www.mp3licensing.com/royalty/broadcast.html</a>).
Want to run an Internet radio station with MP3 compression? On
January 1, 2001, you'd better get out your checkbook. And &ldquo;Bob&rdquo;
help you if you want to say something their lawyers don't
like.</p><p>So what happens now? Do we make some huge corporation in
Europe the new Ministry of Information of Internet radio? Hell no.
This is <i  >Linux Journal</i>, and we love freedom. In
this issue, we're going to give you a crash course in free,
open-source multimedia tools. Remember, when speech depends on
software, free speech depends on free software.</p><p>SoundTracker and Broadcast 2000: If content is king,
low-fidelity content is a mad, drooling king whose nonsensical
decrees go unheard while better-sounding invaders march into his
country, and the people throw flowers before them. Get SoundTracker
and learn how to create MOD audio tracks to keep your listeners
happy. Broadcast 2000 lets you edit your own movies with
cut-and-paste ease.</p><p>FIASCO: Fast, free streaming video depends on a patent-free
compression algorithm. FIASCO, which Ullrich Hafner developed over
the course of five years for his PhD thesis, is a replacement for
MPEG video released under the GPL. Now you don't need to get a
patent license to develop video applications.</p><p>In &ldquo;Streaming Media&rdquo; Frank LaMonica looks at what you need
to do to roll out a streaming media site&mdash;from codecs to RAID
drives to quality of service. And in &ldquo;Running a Net Radio Station
with Open-Source Software&rdquo;, Andy Faulkner and the rest of the
opensourceradio.com crew explain exactly how they did it. They're
using the patented MP3 format, though, which brings us to &ldquo;Ogg
Vorbis&mdash;Open, Free Audio&rdquo; by Jack Moffitt. Ogg Vorbis, the free
replacement for MP3, is definitely ready for prime time, so vorbize
a couple of tracks, clean the wax out of your ears and have a
(patent-free) listening session.</p><p>Finally, we have some really high-tech articles about writing
games that are 3-D both for the eyes and the ears. In &ldquo;The Story
of OpenAL&rdquo; Bernd Kreimeier teaches us about the new standard API
for 3-D audio. I wonder how far you can get in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Heretic2</em></span> with headphones on and your eyes
closed. And, last but not least, we have a sneak preview of the
eagerly anticipated book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Game
Programming</em></span>. Learn how to get started in SDL, a fast
LGPLed library of game development tools.</p><p>&mdash;Don Marti, Technical Editor</p></div></div>
