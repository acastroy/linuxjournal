    The following article is based on a chapter in the author's
    Linux Music and Sound, published by No
    Starch Press in October 2000.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d7580.0x21cf5b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>SoundTracker is the most feature-packed
of all the trackers I've used with Linux. Its interface presents
all the program's tools on a single screen, making it easy to
understand and a pleasure to use. As you will see, tracking with
SoundTracker is a simple process and great fun.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d7580.0x21cf6b8"></a>Getting It, Building It</h2></div></div><p>SoundTracker is available in full source code, as well as RPM
and tarball binaries. Update patches are also available to apply
against previous version source trees. The following instructions
detail building SoundTracker from the full source package.</p><p>Before building the program, study the Requirements page on
the SoundTracker web site and verify that you have all the
necessary libraries and development tools. SoundTracker runs in the
X Window System, so most of what you will need should be included
with any mainstream Linux distribution. However, if you're running
an older Linux distribution, you may need to acquire the most
recent GNOME and GTK packages to build and utilize all of
SoundTracker's features. Visit the the project web sites at
<a href="http://www.gnome.org" target="_self">http://www.gnome.org/</a> and
http://www.gtk.org/ to pick up the latest packages. You should also
install Michael Pruett's libaudiofile, available at
<a href="http://www.68k.org/~michael/audiofile" target="_self">http://www.68k.org/~michael/audiofile/</a>.
SoundTracker's installation documentation also specifies what you
need to build the program, so be sure to read the INSTALL and
README files for the latest instruction updates.</p><p>After you have downloaded SoundTracker and acquired the
necessary support software, you're ready to begin building
SoundTracker. Type <b  >./configure -help</b> for a list
of options you can select to customize the build process, then run
<b  >./configure</b> (with your selected options) to
create the makefiles needed to compile SoundTracker. If no errors
were reported by the configuration procedure, you can then type
<b  >make</b> and watch the compilation take place. If no
errors were reported by the make process, become the superuser by
typing <b  >su root</b> and entering your root password,
then type <b  >make install</b>. The tracker is now ready
to use; you can start it by simply typing
<b  >soundtracker</b> in an xterm window.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d7580.0x21cfb30"></a>Some Preliminary Instructions</h2></div></div><p>As of version 0.5.5, the documentation for SoundTracker
consists of a single README file, but little more is needed.
Trackers all follow a similar design, and the reference materials
found on the United Trackers and MODPlug Central sites will help
you understand the basic use of almost any tracker.</p><p>If you have never used a tracker, you might want to pick up
some mods to load and play in SoundTracker. The resource listings
at United Trackers and MODPlug Central will guide you to some
superb mod collections. Pick some in either MOD or XM format, load
them into SoundTracker, then listen, study and learn.</p><p>All sounds used in mods are sampled sounds, so you'll want to
build a collection of samples that meets your compositional needs.
You can rip samples from existing modules, or you can gather sounds
from the various sample collection sites listed on the United
Trackers and MODPlug Central web pages. SoundTracker can load any
audio file type supported by libaudiofile, so you can freely mix
WAV, AIFF and AU files in the same module.</p><p>SoundTracker uses only monaural samples. If you try to load a
stereo sample, the program politely informs you of that fact, then
gives you the option of loading either the left or right channel or
a mix of the two.</p><p>Spend some time preparing your samples. Tuning and looping
are basic considerations, and SoundTracker supports extensive
editing of a sample's volume and panning. Although a sample editor
is included in the program, you may want a more powerful sound file
editor such as MiXViews, Snd or DAP for finer editing. These
dedicated editors provide greater resolution, more effects
processing and file conversion routines not available in the
editors included with trackers.</p><p>You may find it helpful to load a number of samples into
instrument locations before beginning the tracking process.
SoundTracker provides 128 locations for your samples, so you can
load large libraries of sounds, then scroll through the Instr
number box (just above the Module Info tab) to quickly find the
sound you want. You can easily test any selected sound by pressing
one of the &ldquo;pitched&rdquo; computer keyboard keys (see below for more
details).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d7580.0x21cfdf0"></a>Using SoundTracker</h2></div></div><p></p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4356f1.large.jpg"><img src="4356f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. SoundTracker's Tracker
Display</p></div></div>
</p><p>Figure 1 shows the basic track display from SoundTracker.
I'll discuss how the data got there in a moment, but for now you
only need to know that each of the six columns represents a track
(also called a channel), and each of the four rows represents a
beat.</p><p>Here is the breakdown of the rows in the first track in
Figure 1:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Beat    Pitch   Instrument      Volume  Effect command  Effect parameters000      C-6       01             --         --                 --001      --        --             --         --                 --002      D-6       02             --         --                 --003      --        --             --         --                 --
</pre><p>We see that Instrument #01 (a bass drum sample) plays on the
first beat with a pitch of C6, the default value for volume, and
with no command information for effects processing. Instrument #02
(a snare drum sample) is played on the third beat with a pitch of
D6. If we pressed the Play Pattern button, we would see the track
display repeatedly scroll the columns past the rectangular cursor,
and we would hear a continuously looping pattern of four beats with
bass and snare drums on beats one and three.</p><p>Instrument samples are played at the indicated pitches, and
the instrument numbers may be changed within the channel. Values
can carry or ramp from beat to beat. The effect command and effect
parameter values define the type of effect and its intensity, and
effects can be dynamically controlled beyond the first instance of
a sound. Note that defining varying pitches for your percussion
instruments gives a more realistic sound to drum tracks.</p><p>Taken all together, the events in Figure 1 make up a single
track in a pattern. Each pattern can be up to 64 beats long and can
contain up to 32 tracks. Tracks and patterns can be cut, copied and
pasted. By default, all tracks are set to play together. Left click
on a track's oscilloscope to toggle the track's mute status, right
click the scope to solo the track.</p><p>As shown in Figure 1 (SoundTracker's default display mode),
the program's global organizing controls are at the top left, a
bank of oscilloscopes sits at top right, and the file manager,
tracking display, instrument editor and other tools are organized
in a tabbed block in the bottom half of the screen. We have seen
what a track looks like, now let's find out how to create one of
our own.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d7580.0x21d0370"></a>Entering Events into a Track</h2></div></div><p>You can insert events into a track by using either your
computer's QWERTY keyboard or an external MIDI keyboard. Both
methods can be used in either real-time mode (entering and deleting
events while the pattern loops) or in step-entry mode (inserting
and deleting events one by one, manually incrementing the cursor
position). Let's look at the QWERTY method first.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d7580.0x21d0478"></a>Inserting Events with the QWERTY
Keyboard</h2></div></div><p>Event entry is easy with a two-octave span of notes mapped to
your computer keyboard as is demonstrated in Table 1.</p><p><a href="4356t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Two-Octave Span of
Notes</a></p><p>You can change the starting octave in the Octave scrolling
window to the right of the Editing button (see Figure 1).</p><p>Click on the Editing button, then use the computer keyboard
to audition and insert your instruments (samples) into your tracks.
Just click Play Pattern while in Editing mode, and you can insert
events in real time while the pattern loops (this method is easier
and more accurate at slower tempos). Alternately, you can add
events one by one by scrolling to an entry point and inserting
sounds in step-entry mode. Events are deleted simply by selecting
them with the tracker display cursor (or waiting for the event to
scroll by in real time) and hitting the Delete key.</p><p>You can use the keyboard in other ways as well. Controls are
available for song or pattern play, and nearly all the editing
functions. The combined keyboard/mouse interface is easy to master,
and you'll quickly be able to compose in SoundTracker with ease.
(See Table 2 for a list of the keyboard accelerators.)</p><p><a href="4356t2.html" target="_self">Table 2. Keyboard
Applications</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d7580.0x21d07e8"></a>Inserting Events with a MIDI Keyboard</h2></div></div><p>If your Linux sound system utilizes the ALSA drivers, and if
you have configured SoundTracker for ALSA support, you can use an
external MIDI keyboard to enter events. MIDI input is basically
identical to the QWERTY method. However, you'll need to configure
SoundTracker for MIDI input.</p><p>Open the Settings/MIDI Configuration menu from the top menu
bar. Clicking the Volume button lets SoundTracker use the MIDI
velocity value for the volume of the inserted event. Clicking on
the channel button locks MIDI input to a particular track, so that
MIDI Channel 1 equals Track 1, MIDI Channel 2 equals Track 2 and so
forth. If you select the MIDI channel button, you must change the
MIDI Out channel on your keyboard to input data to another track.
If you leave the button unchecked, you can simply use the Tab or
Shift-Tab keys to select a track for recording (i.e., you won't
need to change your MIDI Out setting on your keyboard). Set the
client and port numbers if necessary (the defaults work fine for
me).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d7580.0x21d0948"></a>Tracking a Module</h2></div></div><p>Tracking (i.e., creating a module) in SoundTracker is a
simple five-step process:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Set your pattern number and length with the
controls in the upper-left block of the display.</p></li><li><p>Click on the Editing radio button and select
Instrument 1 in the global section.</p></li><li><p>Click the Sample Editor tab to load the sample you
want for that instrument.</p></li><li><p>Click the Tracker tab, use the arrow keys to
position the cursor box over the first event entry space for
Instrument 1 and select the note desired from the QWERTY or MIDI
keyboard as described above. Remember, any note can be deleted
simply by selecting it again and pressing the computer keyboard's
Delete key.</p></li><li><p>Repeat this process for each beat until you have
the pattern and instrumentation desired. You can play your pattern
at any time, a feature that greatly speeds up the composition
process.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d7580.0x25c9068"></a>Event Details</h2></div></div><p>We have already seen that the event entry line has four
fields, shown as columns of numbers, indicating the pitch chosen
for the sample playback, the instrument number, the volume and the
effects field. The effects field combines the effect command and
parameter value into one three-digit entry. Only the pitch
indicator follows the traditional pitch/octave notation; all other
values are represented by decimal or hex numbering (you can select
the representation you prefer).</p><p>The effects command not only adds typical effects such as
vibrato, tremolo, LFO and filtering, it also provides signals to
start the subsequent pattern, jump to a new position in the event
list, and even jump to a new position and loop from that point for
a specified time. It also provides a fine-tuning parameter for more
accurate intonation of a sample at a particular pitch level.</p><p>The highlighted line in Figure 2 shows a typical tracker
event entry: a bass instrument with a pitch of C6 and the defaults
for volume and effects. The entry is located on the first beat of a
four-beat pattern.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4356f2.large.jpg"><img src="4356f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. A Single Bass Note in a Four-Beat
Pattern</p></div></div>
</p><p>Figure 3 shows the procedure carried out to create a C major
scale, rising over a period of 16 beats, from C6 to C7 (the
highlight line is mid-scale at F6). In Figures 1 and 2, the tempo
has been set to 100BPM (beats per minute), and only two channels
are represented, with nothing in channel two yet.
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4356f3.large.jpg"><img src="4356f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. A Scale Played by the Bass
Instrument</p></div></div>
</p><p>Note that SoundTracker provides a Tempo control as well as a
BPM setting. This control is perhaps best thought of as a kind of
&ldquo;throttle&rdquo; over the BPM setting. A Tempo of one is the fastest,
and all higher numbers gradually slow the speed of the pattern
playback. The default Tempo of six matches the BPM to the speed of
a metronome with the same BPM setting. Note also that Tempo and BPM
are global, so changing their settings will affect the speed of all
patterns in your song.</p><p>The pattern length and number of channels can be varied at
will in the global section. Changing the pattern length or the
number of channels in the global section immediately updates both
the global and tabbed sections.</p><p>Figure 4 shows a more complex pattern from a completed song.
The screenshot was taken while looping pattern five, so you can see
the activity of the individual instruments in the oscilloscopes at
the upper right. The pattern is set to 16 beats (4/4 time) with
events added for bass guitar, bass drum, snare, hi-hat, cymbal and
guitar.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4356f4.large.jpg"><img src="4356f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. A More Complex Pattern</p></div></div>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d7580.0x25c99b0"></a>From Pattern to Song</h2></div></div><p>After creating patterns, you chain them together to create a
completed song. This is also an easy procedure. In the upper left
corner, set the song length desired (the Insert/Delete buttons can
also dynamically control Song length), use the Current Position box
to select an insert location point for your pattern, and then use
the Pattern box to select which pattern will play at that location.
In the example shown in Figure 4, the song length is set to 46
patterns. The display can show only one pattern at a time, but
scrolling the Current Position box would reveal that positions 0
through 3 are taken by pattern 2, positions 4 through 6 are
occupied by pattern 1, position 7 belongs to pattern 11 and so
forth.</p><p>When completed, files can be saved in the common XM (Extended
Module) format. You can also render your XM to a WAV file directly
from SoundTracker.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d7580.0x25c9b10"></a>Additional SoundTracker Features</h2></div></div><p></p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4356f5.large.jpg"><img src="4356f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5. SoundTracker's Sample
Editor</p></div></div>
</p><p>Figure 5 shows a bass WAV file loaded in the Sample Editor.
SoundTracker's editor is not intended to be a full-fledged sound
file editing environment, but it does provide basic cut/copy/paste
operations, along with the loop mode settings and initial volume,
pan and fine-tune controls. It also has the option to load 8-bit
sound files.</p><p>You can record your own samples directly into SoundTracker by
clicking on the Monitor button. When the Sampling Window appears,
click on the Start Sampling button and record away.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4356f6.large.jpg"><img src="4356f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 6. SoundTracker's Instrument
Editor</p></div></div>
</p><p>Figure 6 shows the Instrument Editor display where you can
edit the volume and pan envelopes of a sample (while the song or
pattern is playing, if you wish). This panel also provides a
keyboard for mapping your samples across an instrument's
range.</p><p>XI instruments can be loaded and saved in the Instrument
Editor as well as from the Instrument menu in the top menu bar.
These instruments are samples specially prepared for use in
trackers with defined loop points and envelopes for volume and
panning as well as vibrato effect information. You can load and
edit your sounds in the Sample Editor, edit them further in the
Instrument Editor, and save them as your own XI instruments simply
by selecting the Save XI option from either the Instrument Editor
tab or the top menu bar Instrument menu.</p><p>For more information regarding the XI instrument format,
please see the file xi.txt in the SoundTracker doc
directory.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4356f7.large.jpg"><img src="4356f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 7. Tracking in Jazz Edit
Mode</p></div></div>
</p><p>With the Tracker tab displayed, select Edit/Jazz Edit Mode
from the top menu bar. A row of buttons will appear across the top
of the Tracker panel, corresponding to the number of channels in
your pattern. Click on any of these buttons to define the number of
tracks to remain active for Jazz Edit mode. Now, when an event is
entered into an active channel, the cursor box will automatically
advance to the next active channel.</p><p>Figure 7 shows the Tracker display opened in Jazz Edit mode.
The pattern has four channels, with channels 2 and 4 selected for
Jazz Edit mode. After entering an event into Track 2, the cursor
box will advance to the next beat in Track 4; after entering an
event in Track 4, the cursor will return to Track 2 and so on. You
can override this activity at any time by using the Tab or
Shift-Tab keys to relocate the cursor box to another
channel.</p><p>Jazz Edit is very handy in real-time tracking. In Figure 7,
channels 1 and 3 will continue to play as usual while you shuttle
between the tracks selected for Jazz Edit mode. Note that you can
change your instrument numbers in real time and even load new
samples while your pattern plays (though larger samples will likely
cause playback to &ldquo;hiccup&rdquo;). In fact, real-time edits can be made
in any entry box not greyed-out during playback.</p><p>You can modify your computer keyboard's note entry behavior
by clicking on the Volume Envelope button in the Instrument Editor
and then clicking on the Sustain button (seen at the right side of
Volume Envelope display in Figure 6). Now, when you play your
keyboard, it will respond like a real synthesizer keyboard, with
your &ldquo;note-off&rdquo; following the key release. You may need to adjust
your audio buffers for the shortest possible latency (open the
Settings/Audio Configuration menu and select Editing Output from
the key at the top of the dialog box). In effect, your keyboard can
now be played with polyphony (simultaneous sounds) as high as the
number of channels selected for Jazz Edit mode.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d7580.0x25ca560"></a>Closing Remarks</h2></div></div><p>SoundTracker is the most developed Linux tracker available,
and it continues to grow in power and flexibility. The program is
consistently maintained by its author, often incorporating features
and fixes submitted by users corresponding via an active and
helpful mail-list. Performance is quite stable, and, as you have
seen, the program is very easy to use. Whether you're a seasoned
pro or a complete newbie to tracking, SoundTracker is a first-rate
tool for creating your Linux mod masterpieces.</p><p>The author sends special thanks to Michael Krause and
&ldquo;Mister X aka Kim&rdquo; for their helpful comments and suggestions.
