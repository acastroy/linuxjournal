    Breaking through the maximum process number restriction in
    i386-based Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1566580.0x165e660"></a></h2></div></div><p>Process management is the most import
part of an operating system. Its design and implementation can
greatly affect performance. In a multiprocess OS, many processes
run simultaneously, thus increasing the CPU usage and system
performance. By running processes concurrently, we provide multiple
services and serve more clients at the same time, which is the main
task of a modern OS.
</p><p>In the Linux Intel i386 architecture, multiprocess is already
supported. By choosing proper process scheduling algorithms, it has
lower average response time and relatively high system performance.
But unfortunately, there is a limitation in the Linux kernel 2.2.x
that limits the number of running processes to 4090. This number
may be enough for a desktop system but is inadequate for an
enterprise server.</p><p>Consider the basic principle of a typical web server, which
is based on multiprocess/multithread technology. When a client
request comes, the web server creates a child process or thread to
handle the request. So it is easy for a heavy load server to have
thousands of processes running. In fact, most of such enterprise
servers run operating systems like Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, etc.,
rather than Linux.</p><p>Many Linux developers have noticed this problem and have
tried to solve it. In experimental version 2.3.x and prerelease
2.4, this limitation has been dealt with. But, it will still be a
while before the official release of 2.4, and it may take even
longer for it to be stable. Does this mean we have to choose
another OS? Is it possible to find a solution that can break
through that limitation for Linux 2.2.x? In order to answer this
question, first we have to know how process management in 2.2.x
works.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1566580.0x165e870"></a>Intel i386 Architecture and Linux 2.2.x Memory
Management</h2></div></div><p>Process management is tightly bound with memory management.
Since the implementation of memory management is based on hardware
architecture, we have to have a look at the i386 architecture
first. In modern operating systems, virtual memory technology is
widely employed. Thanks to virtual memory technology, software can
use more memory than is physically present. That is to say, the
memory addresses used by software are virtual and are converted to
real address by processor-provided mechanisms during access.</p><p>There are two basic memory management methods: segmentation
and paging. Segmentation means dividing memory into several
segments and accessing memory by both segment pointer and offset.
This method is used in early systems like PDP-11, etc. Paging means
dividing memory into several fixed-size pages and using pages as
the basic memory management unit. When accessing memory, an address
is converted to a physical address according to the page
table.</p><p>Memory management in the i386 architecture is called
segmentation with paging. The virtual address space is divided into
segments first by using two tables: the Global Descriptor Table
(GDT) and Local Descriptor Table (LDT). After this, the virtual
address is converted to a linear address. Then the linear address
is converted to a physical address using two-level page tables: the
Page Directory Table and Page Table. Figure 1 shows how the virtual
address has been converted to a real address.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4407f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Virtual Address Convert
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4407f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Global Descriptor Table
</p></div></div><p>In Linux, the kernel runs in ring 0. By setting GDT, the
kernel puts its code and data into a separate address space. All
other programs run in ring 3 with their data and code in the same
address space. Creating different page tables protects those user
programs. The GDT table in Linux 2.2.x is shown below in Figure 2.
In practice, a user program can use other code/data segments by
setting LDT.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1566580.0x165edf0"></a>Kernel 2.2.x Process Management</h2></div></div><p>A process is a running program with all resources allocated.
It is a dynamic concept. In the i386 architecture, &ldquo;task&rdquo; is an
alternative name for process. For convenience, here we will use
process only. Process management is a concept concerned with system
initialization, process creation and destruction, scheduling,
interprocess communication, etc. In Linux, process is actually a
group of data structures including the context of process,
scheduling data, semaphores, process queue, process id, time,
signals, etc. This group of data is called Process Control Block or
PCB. In implementation, PCB is in the bottom of the process
stack.</p><p>Process management in Linux relies greatly on the hardware
architecture. We have just discussed the basis of page-with-segment
memory management in i386, but in fact, segment plays a more
important role than just a block of memory. For example, Task
Status Segment is one of the most important segments in i386. It
contains much data that is required by the system. Each process
must have a TSS pointed by TR register. According to the definition
of i386, the selector in TR must select a descriptor in GDT.
Additionally, the selector in LDTR, which defines a process LDT,
must have a corresponding entry in GDT as well.</p><p>In order to satisfy the above requirements, Linux 2.2.x GDT
is allocated for all possible processes. The maximum concurrent
process number is defined when booting the kernel. The kernel
reserves 2 GDT entries for each process.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1566580.0x165efa8"></a>System Initialization</h2></div></div><p>In Linux 2.2.x, some process-management-concerned data
structures are initialized when booting the system. The most
important of these are GDT and the process list.</p><p>When the kernel starts, it must decide the size of GDT. Since
two GDT entries must be kept in GDT for each process, the size of
GDT is defined by the maximum concurrent process number. In Linux,
this number is defined as NR_TASKS at compile time. According to
Figure 2, the size of GDT is 10+2(with APM)+NR_TASKS*2.</p><p>The process list is actually an array of PCB pointers,
defined below:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Struct task_struct *task[NR_TASKS] = {&amp;init_task,};
</pre><p>In the above line, <b  >init_task</b> is the PCB of
the root process. After inserting this process into the process
list, the process management mechanism can begin its work. Note the
size of process list is also dependant on
<b  >NR_TASKS</b>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1566580.0x165f2c0"></a>Process Creation</h2></div></div><p>In Linux 2.2.x process is created by a system call, fork. The
new process is the child process of the original process. Using a
clone can create a thread, which is actually a lightweight process.
In fact, there is no real thread in Linux 2.2.x. Figure 3 shows how
the fork system call works.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4407f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Fork System Call
</p></div></div><p>The key steps in fork are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Create the new process PCB: the kernel allocates
two pages for the new process stack, and the PCB is put at the
bottom of it.</p></li><li><p>Insert the new process into the process list: the
kernel must find a empty entry from the process list. If the system
has reached the maximum concurrent process limit, no empty entry
will be found and the system call fails.</p></li><li><p>Copy parent address space: the child process has
its own address space, but first it shares address space with its
parent using copy-on-write mechanism. The corresponding GDT
descriptor of the new process LDT is also created in this
step.</p></li><li><p>Setting TSS for new process: the TSS of the new
process is created in PCB and the corresponding GDT descriptor is
also created.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1566580.0x165f8f0"></a>Scheduling</h2></div></div><p>The core of scheduling is the algorithm listed below. But
here we just take a look at process switching. In Linux 2.2.x
process switch is done in the switch_to function. It works like
this:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>load new TSS by setting TR</p></li><li><p>save old FS and GS registers into old PCB</p></li><li><p>load LDT if needed by new process</p></li><li><p>load new page tables for new process</p></li><li><p>load new process FS and GS</p></li></ol></div><p>Note that the value of TR and LDTR are coming from PCB.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1566580.0x16566a8"></a>Breakthrough the Maximum Process Number
Restriction</h2></div></div><p>What is the maximum process number restriction? According to
the above discussion, we can easily find why there is a maximum
process number restriction. The NR_TASKS defined in Linux 2.2.x
statically defines the maximum concurrent process number at the
compile time. NR_TASKS also defined the size of GDT at compile
time. As defined in i386 architecture, the maximum size of GDT is
8192*8 bytes, which means it can contain 8,192 descriptors. In
Linux 2.2.x, when booting the kernel, GDT is used as described
below:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>NULL descriptor (entry 0), reserved descriptor
(entry 1,6,7)</p></li><li><p>Kernel code and data descriptors (entry 2,3) and
user code and data descriptors (entry 4,5)</p></li><li><p>APM BIOS descriptors (entry 8-11)</p></li></ol></div><p>In total, 12 entries are used. And since each process needs
two GDT entries, in theory we can get (8192 -12)/2 = 4090 processes
running concurrently.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1566580.0x1656a70"></a>Solution to This Problem</h2></div></div><p>Although GDT size is restricted by hardware, we still can
find a solution for this problem. For one CPU, only one process can
be running at a certain time. That is to say, it is not necessary
to reserve GDT descriptors for all possible processes at all. When
a process is about to run, we set its descriptors
dynamically.</p><p>After analyzing the PCB structure, we can find the TSS and
LDT (if any) in it. So when doing a process switch, we can find
these two segments by PCB pointer, like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
TSS: proc-&gt;tss
LDT:proc-&gt;mm-&gt;segments
</pre><p>In fact, when doing a process switch, we can find the PCB
pointer from the process list. Since both TSS and LDT can be found,
keeping them in GDT at all times is unnecessary.
</p><p>Our solution is to reserve only two GDT descriptors for each
CPU, using common entries for all processes. For example, in a
machine with two CPUs, four GDT entries are reserved. When process
A will run on CPU1, GDT entry three and four will be set to the
descriptor of TSS and LDT of process A. Old values of these entries
are discarded. Remaining GDT entries are used just the same as the
original system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1566580.0x1656cd8"></a>Implementation Brief</h2></div></div><p>The basis of our solution is to set the process TSS and LDT
descriptor dynamically (see Listing 1).</p><p><a href="4407l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. System
Initialization</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1566580.0x1656e90"></a>Process Switch</h2></div></div><p>In the original design, when doing the fork operation, the
tss.ldt and tss.tr in PCB are used to save selectors in LDTR and
TR. According to the original algorithm, the selector of the LDT of
a process may exceed its 16-bit limit. So we use extra variable
tss.__ldth with tss.ldt to save the selector. Since tss.__ldth is
not used in Linux 2.2.x, our modification won't break the kernel.
The saving of LDTR and TR now works like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
((unsigned long *) &amp; (p-&gt;tss.ldt)) =
   (unsigned long)_LDT(nr);
if (*((unsigned long *) &amp; (p-&gt;tss.ldt)) &lt;
   (unsignedlong)(8192&lt;&lt; 3)
        set_ldt_desc(nr,ldt, LDT_ENTRIES);
        // original code here else{
        //do nothing
        //let the process switch code handle LDT
        //and TSS
}
</pre><p>One of the benefits of this implementation is that we can
easily discover if this process number is greater than 4088 by
inspecting the value of tss.ldt. This is important for performance.
</p><p>If a process number is greater than 4,088, it has no reserved
descriptor in GDT and must use the shared GDT entries. We can find
these entries by this code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
SHARED_TSS_ENTRY + smp_processor_id();
</pre><p>Listing 2 shows the code for dealing with the shared GDT
entries.
</p><p><a href="4407l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Using Shared GOT
Entries</a></p><p>After doing these, we have broken through the maximum process
number restriction. We can even add an extra parameter in the lilo
configuration file to set this number dynamically. The following
line will set the maximum process number to 40,000, which is much
greater than 4,090:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        Append = "nrtasks=40000"
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1566580.0x16572b0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>According to the above solution, we can set the upper limit
of concurrent process number to 2G, in theory. But in practice,
hardware and OS still limit this number. When creating a new
process, the kernel will allocate memory for it, like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Process stack (2 pages) + page table (1 page)
+ page directory table (1 page) = 4 pages
</pre><p>So if the computer has 1G memory and uses five pages per
process where the OS uses 20M of memory, the maximum process number
can be:
<pre     class="programlisting">
(1G - 20M) / 20K = 51404 ~= 50,000
</pre>


More practically, a process will use 30K memory at least, so the
number now is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
50000 * (2/3) = 33,000
</pre>


This number is still much greater than 4,090.
