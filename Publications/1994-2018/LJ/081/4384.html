<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4384f1.jpg"></div>
 Buying a laptop computer teaches you all about confusion and
sometimes about yourself too. Nothing brings out anal-retentive
dithering like considering spending thousands of dollars on
something you can tuck under your arm. Nothing sparks confusion
like going through dozens of nearly identical but critically
different specifications, searching for some clue about how you
should spend your money.</p><p>It seems simple enough when you start: maximize the features,
minimize the price. Simple does not describe the details, though.
The details can drive you insane. Screen size, CPU type,
DVD/CD/CD-RW drives, hard drive capacity, battery life, weight,
mouse substitute, expansion ports, video capabilities&mdash;just
describing it is enough to make a person hyperventilate. Not only
is it an immense list, every item represents a trade-off. Want the
best battery life? Be prepared to carry a couple of extra pounds or
have a weak processor and few features. Want the biggest screen? It
won't look as good. The fastest CPU? The batteries won't last as
long. Lots of expandability? Everything gets bigger.</p><p>And the safe shortcuts that people fall back on aren't always
reliable. Buying by brand is a good way to donate an extra thousand
dollars to a big company for the exact same product. It is not
unusual to find three laptops, each supposedly from different
makers, which are exactly the same unit: the same OEM, the same
expandability and the same hardware capabilities. But not the same
price&mdash;far from it. Just to confuse things, sometimes supposedly
identical laptops sold under different brand names seem the same,
but do not have exactly the same features. The display available
from one vendor may not be sold by any of the others, though all
are the same core unit.</p><p>Adding Linux compatibility to your requirements list only
makes matters worse. Virtually every laptop has
<span   class="emphasis"><em>something</em></span> that Linux can't quite take
advantage of. Maybe the power-saving suspend feature won't actually
suspend; maybe the sound is difficult to get working; maybe
everything will work fine once Linux is installed, but you can't
install unless you have a network because the CD-ROM isn't
recognized by any of the standard Linux boot floppies.</p><p>Whatever mix of requirements you have, finding a laptop that
does what you need can involve a lot of Net time, a lot of
searching and a lot of faith in the manufacturers. Even when your
requirements seem simple, it is seductively easy to start out
looking for a $1,200 economy laptop and end up buying a $3,400
full-featured desktop replacement. Every step seems so reasonable
that you hardly even realize what you are doing until the bill
comes. Car dealerships could learn a lot from laptop manufacturers
about up-selling their products.</p><p>But, after your nervous breakdown and before the credit card
bill arrives, there is something really wonderful about a great
laptop. It may have cost more then a nice used car, but you can't
take a car into a restaurant either. Knowing that you are carrying
around enough computing power to cause a gadget freak from ten
years ago to pass out is a pleasure that extends beyond pure
geekdom: anyone can understand it.</p><p>The TuxTops Obsidian is exactly that sort of machine. As
close to a no-compromise laptop as you can buy, it combines battery
life, performance, display and video capabilities and even
ergonomics in a package that will make most people happy&mdash;if
anything will. Most importantly, every TuxTops laptop comes with
Linux pre-installed. Yeah, that other desktop OS is available, but
Linux is the main deal here.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x228c580.0x2384c38"></a>So, What's It Got?</h2></div></div><p>The TuxTops Obsidian is a top-of-the-line laptop, and the
test unit was configured to prove it. Start with a 650/500MHz
SpeedStep Pentium III, 256 Megabytes of RAM, an 18 gigabyte hard
drive, 8MB ATI Rage mobility LT video chip set, 6 speed DVD drive,
a 15-inch 1024x768 display and all of the usual features like
sound, dual PC-CARD/Cardbus slots, a floppy drive, a built-in
Lucent Winmodem, IrDA, serial and parallel ports, a port replicator
connector for desktop use and more, most of which are ready to use
the first time the system boots into Linux.</p><p>In laptop jargon the TuxTops Premium is a three-spindle
design, meaning that the floppy drive, hard drive and CD/DVD drive
can all be installed in the laptop's case and used at the same
time. The CD/DVD is actually in a quick-release media bay that can
accept a CD/DVD ROM, ZIP, CD-RW or even a second battery.</p><p>Physically, the TuxTops Premium is about as no-nonsense and
as tough as you can get without resorting to titanium. The case is
a tough black plastic that seems immune to casual scratching from
watchbands, keys and just about anything else. The age-old problem
of break-off dust covers that weren't meant to break off has been
solved by leaving the covers out entirely. The only part that
really seems vulnerable is the large display. It twists noticeably
if adjusted by holding only one corner. If you have a diskette in
the floppy drive, the eject button extends rather far, preventing
you from storing a disk in the drive while the computer is in its
carrying case.</p><p>The keyboard has an above average feel, but in my opinion the
key layout is a bit strained in places. For example, the home, end,
page up and page down keys are at the top of the keyboard and the
regular cursor controls are at the bottom. I prefer laptops that
use the FN key to merge all of the cursor controls into the same
four keys. The FN key is in general rather under-used, with only
five or six functions, mostly related to controlling the hardware.
Of the standard keyboard keys, only SysRq, Scroll Lock and Break
require the use of the FN key.</p><p>The mouse is a two-button touch pad, which can be a critical
issue for some users. Emotions run strong. People either love them
or hate them, and arguments about the most appropriate laptop
pointing device have been known to degenerate into fist fights. You
should spend a few minutes using a laptop with a touch pad before
you make up your mind, but if your thumbs tend to drift around
below the space bar, you may find your mouse pointer bouncing
around when you least expect it. When used in X, the two buttons
must be chorded&mdash;clicked at the same time&mdash;to emulate the third
mouse button. A minor inconvenience for normal use, but tedious
with software that makes extensive use of the third button.</p><p>There is also a selection of connectors and buttons that
aren't used in Linux, such as the single USB connector, the
push-button style external volume control and, depending on your
kernel version, the Lucent WinModem.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x228c580.0x2384ef8"></a>Reliability</h2></div></div><p>Having a laptop fail is not only more expensive than the same
failure in a desktop computer, but more likely: you carry laptops
around and what gets carried gets dropped. Or, if not dropped,
mistreated in other ways. A laptop lives a dangerous life.</p><p>A real laptop test would involve a few well-staged drops from
tables or small office buildings. A real test would...but I'm a
coward. Cheap, too. I didn't do anything to intentionally damage
the TuxTops laptop, but I haven't been gentle either.</p><p>What I have done is carried it almost everywhere for the last
month or so. It has traveled over 1,700 miles (I counted) over
six-lane highways and dirt roads, shared table space with dozens of
hamburgers, been lugged in and out of office buildings, houses,
shopping malls, public parks and anywhere else I could safely go.
It has been opened and closed, demonstrated to strangers, shoved
haphazardly into its carry bag to allow quick escapes from
coworkers and other undesirable associates, been tossed into
trunks, loaned to friends and generally abused as much as I could
abuse it without actually, officially, trying to harm
anything.</p><p>I have given it the workout that a truly laptop-enchanted
geek would give their computer if it wasn't going to be their
computer forever and if they didn't have to pay for repairs. I've
done my best to put a year of use into a month of time&mdash;and the
result has been enlightening.</p><p>The worst problem is that the display is difficult to clean.
I have learned that laptop displays and fast food don't mix, which
says more about the American diet than the reliability of this
laptop, though.</p><p>There has been an assortment of little problems, some
trivial, some preventable and some troubling, but none critical.
Perhaps the most trivially bothersome problem has been the little
rubber feet. They come off if you try to slide the computer across
a desk or tabletop. So far, they have always reattached themselves
when pushed back into place, but it would be easy to lose them.
Several of the screws securing the various access covers on the
bottom of the case showed a tendency to come loose, though that may
have been caused by my surreptitious opening of each cover after
receiving the laptop. The most troubling problem isn't really a
problem, but it could become one: there seems to be a loose screw
or another small part rattling around in the case, near the floppy
drive. Whatever is rattling around hasn't caused any damage yet,
but the laptop wasn't rattling when I received it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x228c580.0x23851b8"></a>Is It Cool Enough?</h2></div></div><p>Cramming a 650MHz or faster CPU into a tiny case without
paying careful attention to getting rid of the heat modern CPUs
produce is a recipe for melted plastic. Modern laptops get
hot&mdash;sometimes very hot. The TuxTops Obsidian uses a flow-through
heat sink with a thermostat controlled fan that draws air from the
side and pushes it out the back of the case when the CPU
temperature climbs. The fan is very small, and in a quiet office or
home environment the sound it produces can be very noticeable. In a
restaurant or car you'll probably never realize it has turned on,
though. Perhaps literally&mdash;the first person I loaned the TuxTops
to, returned it after less than 20 minutes of use, citing a fear
that the unit would melt if left on. It does get hot (hot enough to
keep it off your lap, unless you have thick pants) but not hot
enough to melt. This is normal. The designers chose to use the
bottom of the case for heat dissipation, helping them reduce their
dependence on the power-wasting fan.</p><p>Running the computer with a blocked air vent is definitely
not advised, though. After an hour or so the smell of hot plastic
will probably give you a headache.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x228c580.0x2385318"></a>Battery Life</h2></div></div><p>The single Lithium Ion battery provided about three hours of
normal use when using the SpeedStep feature to reduce the CPU speed
to 500MHz and using the automatic power management in the BIOS. The
life was a little longer in some cases, with the longest being
about three and a half hours. It was significantly shorter with
heavy disc use or when the CPU was turned up to full speed.</p><p>For extended use, you can easily install a second battery by
removing the DVD/CD-ROM drive and hot swapping the batteries to
keep the computer running as long as you have charged batteries.
The system will automatically fully deplete the first battery
before starting on the second, so you can easily manage your
battery use.</p><p>The batteries are, at $100 to $200 each (depending on when
and where you buy them), priced similarly to other batteries of the
type. In other words, they are very expensive. The extra price is
well worth it for the long run times these batteries provide. Each
battery has its own microprocessor to monitor the charge status and
control the charging appropriately for the particular battery.
There is a built-in charge indicator that will, at the touch of a
button, light an LED bar graph to indicate the charge state of a
battery that is not installed in the laptop, so you can keep track
of which batteries you've used and which are ready for use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x228c580.0x23854d0"></a>What about Linux?</h2></div></div><p>Linux support is where TuxTops really shines. The folks at
TuxTops are real-life Linux users, not just suits who saw some
advantage to offering &ldquo;Linux for the weirdos&rdquo;. The folks at
TuxTops know and use Linux, and they know and use their own
products, so when you ask a support question they can answer it
from personal experience. The test laptop came with an unofficial
Red Hat 6.2 release pre-installed and configured to take advantage
of the Laptop's hardware. All of the hardware drivers are
pre-installed, as is the XFree86 configuration file for the LCD
display. The first time you boot your TuxTops Obsidian, you are
asked to supply some basic information to configure features such
as networking. After that, the system will always boot into an
X11-based login screen.</p><p>Also included was a bootable CD-ROM with Red Hat and several
laptop-specific RPM packages ready for installation. Reinstalling
Linux is as easy as booting from the CD and acknowledging the
repeated warnings that you will lose all Linux files on the hard
drive. Unfortunately, there is no way to specify how the hard drive
will be partitioned, or which partitions will be formatted, so you
will always have a large /home partition with new files on it. This
reduces the value of having a /home partition at all.</p><p>The biggest problem with the Red Hat installation was
actually the lack of choices when installing it. TuxTops installs
the software you need, and the result is a laptop where everything
that can work, works, but a lot of the choices have been taken
away. The default desktop is GNOME, and while KDE is installed
there is no option to make it the default-user environment.
Likewise, there are very few choices about how the rest of the
system is installed and what software is used.</p><p>The folks at TuxTops report that by the time this article is
in print they will be offering a wide range of Linux distributions
pre-installed on the Obsidian and all of their laptops. I didn't
have a chance to try out any of the other distributions, but if
they are as well configured as the Red Hat installation, TuxTops
will make a lot of people who want or need other distributions
happy.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x228c580.0x23856e0"></a>And the Other Operating System?</h2></div></div><p>The review laptop came in a dual boot configuration with Red
Hat and Microsoft Windows98. The Windows installation was about as
bare bones as you will find in a computer. The operating system was
installed, but there was no user software&mdash;no office suite, no DVD
player software, nothing but Windows. This makes sense from a
company that really isn't trying to sell Windows at all, but you
should be aware that if you buy a dual boot system, you will need
to add your own software to make the Windows installation
useful.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x228c580.0x23857e8"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>The TuxTops Obsidian provides top-of-the-line performance,
great expandability and great support at a price that is a lot
lower than nearly identical hardware from other vendors. If you are
looking for a desktop replacement system or a highpowered laptop,
it is hard to go wrong with the TuxTops Obsidian.</p><p><a href="4384s1.html" target="_self">The Good and The Bad</a></p></div></div>
