Introducing KDE 4&mdash;the desktop revolution is coming. 
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbec580.0xce4240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
KDE 4, first announced two years ago, is the next step for the popular
UNIX desktop environment. With the shift to a new major version of
the toolkit used to build KDE, developers are able to break free of
requirements for compatibility and make radical changes to the codebase.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbec580.0xce43f8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Qt 4</b></p><p>
Qt 4 is a library for building user interfaces in C++. It
provides most of the graphical elements of KDE applications.
</p><p>
Qt 4 heralds vastly better memory efficiency and a new painting system
that is able to leverage new advances in X.org for previously unseen
levels of eye candy. It also provides, for the first time, a GPL'd version
of the library on Apple's OS X and Microsoft's Windows, making porting
KDE applications to other platforms a possibility.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbec580.0xce4660"></a>Plasma</h2></div></div><p>
The default desktop infrastructure, well remembered as operating
on similar lines since KDE 2, is being completely redesigned. The new
desktop shell, Plasma, promises to re-invent the desktop paradigm. Headed
by Aaron Siego, Plasma's team of developers has been working on a
complete replacement for the previous infrastructure of the KDE panel
and desktop, and the results are breathtaking.
</p><p>
Plasma incorporates most of what is seen on screen at first login. It is
a flexible, fully scalable and rotatable desktop shell with the ability
to embed mini-applications and media as applets or widgets known as
plasmoids. The concept of applets is not a new one to desktop design,
but Plasma brings a few innovations to the table.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9946f1.large.jpg"><img src="9946f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Plasma, Showing Some of the Included Plasmoids
</p></div></div><p>
Plasma divorces the data engine from the presentation, allowing developers
to write a data engine once and then present this in an arbitrary number
of ways in an applet. For example, once an engine to extract system
performance state has been written, multiple plasmoids can present this
information in different ways. A desktop plasmoid might have a large,
detail-rich display, but the same data displayed on the panel might
recognise its spatial constraints and display a simpler view.
</p><p>
Native Plasma applets can be implemented as containments, which are simply
applets that can contain another applet. The panel is a containment,
as is the desktop itself, and an applet contained within the panel can
be dragged to the desktop or another panel, and vice versa, reforming
and reflowing itself to fit its physical constraints.
</p><p>
This flexibility opens up, among other possibilities, the ability for
scalable displays to enable a content-rich desktop on a PC or a display
that's more suited to low-screen resolutions on an embedded device. KDE 4.1
plans to support OS
X dashboard widgets, hinging on
new features in a release of WebKit scheduled for early 2008.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbec580.0xce4ad8"></a>Oxygen</h2></div></div><p>
Oxygen is the name chosen for the cohesive look and feel for the new KDE
desktop. As well as creating beauty, the Oxygen team of artists
is working with user interface guidelines to ensure that identification
of elements is a priority. The result is a clean break from the previous
KDE style, obviously inspired in part by already-existing artwork, but
bringing it together with something fresh that is distinctly Oxygen's
own. Oxygen also incorporates the system sound package, combining with
the rest of the artwork to create something that is uniquely KDE.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9946f2.large.jpg"><img src="9946f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Oxygen Icon Set
</p></div></div><p>
With a team of three core icon designers, Oxygen relies on a set of strict
style guidelines and an official colour palette to ensure a consistent
result. The colours chosen are rich without being overpowering, and the
icon design is modern and appealing.
</p><p>
An advantage of the new Oxygen icon theme is that it will be the first
truly open KDE icon theme. The previous default for the long-running
KDE 3 series, Crystal, never had its sources made available. The Oxygen
team has been working exclusively in SVG, ensuring the set remains open.
</p><p>
The Oxygen style and window decoration is a large-scale departure from
the Plastik style that became default in the late 3.x series. The muted
pale gray and blue colours have made way for a brilliant off-white for
both window decoration and controls. Green, orange and blue highlights
are used sparingly with pleasing effect. The result looks extremely
clean and modern, although such a large departure no doubt will draw
some criticism. A wide range of colour schemes are available to suit
almost every taste.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9946f3.large.jpg"><img src="9946f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Oxygen uses bold highlights with low-contrast widgets to achieve
a clean and modern look.
</p></div></div><p>
One minor concern about the new style is how much screen real estate
it seems to use. We looked at KDE 4 on a Lenovo ThinkPad at
1400x1050 pixels, which seemed adequate for the task but by no means
overgenerous. People still using 1024x768 or lower resolutions may
struggle with the defaults.
</p><p>
A new wallpaper set has been collated, with the Oxygen artists acting
as judges to select community submissions. The team chose 15 wallpapers,
and the results are breathtaking. This kind of community involvement is
unquestionably one of the strengths of the open-source development model.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9946f4.large.jpg"><img src="9946f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
Unfortunately, we were unable to preview the Oxygen sound theme
properly&mdash;at the time of this writing, KDE 4 had not yet been
released, and something
about our sound card was causing the KDE sound system, Phonon, to crash.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbec580.0xce5370"></a>Solid</h2></div></div><p>
Another core KDE 4 technology is the introduction of Solid. Solid is a
library for hardware discovery, network and power management. It's an
attempt to deal better with the ever-changing devices and connections of
portable systems in our increasingly wireless world. Solid will integrate
with popular frameworks, such as freedesktop.org's HAL and Novell's Network
Manager, to leverage their features on supported platforms.
</p><p>
Solid implements graceful handling of off-line/on-line state for
applications that use it. A Solid-aware e-mail client would, for example,
know that you were off-line and not attempt to connect to your mail
server if you opened it to check an older e-mail message or look up a contact
while off-line.
</p><p>
Solid also includes a command-line utility called solidshell to manipulate its API for
scripting purposes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbec580.0xce5580"></a>Phonon</h2></div></div><p>
Phonon is a sound framework that was created to supply a stable and
consistent API for KDE applications. It's capable of using a variety of
engines as its back end and can switch between those engines on the
fly. Phonon integrates closely with Solid to maintain awareness of
sound-capable hardware attached to the system. It's capable of per-application
volume settings, grouped by category, and also is able to route different
categories through different devices&mdash;for example, selecting to 
deliver a VoIP conversation only through the headset and leaving the other
system sounds to play through the sound card.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9946f5.large.jpg"><img src="9946f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Phonon Settings Dialog
</p></div></div><p>
Phonon is written to be cross-platform, needing only a platform-specific
engine as a back end to it. Along with the Xine back end that the KDE Project
developed, the maker of Qt (Trolltech) has released Phonon back ends
for GStreamer (Linux), DirectShow (Windows) and Core Audio/QuickTime
(OS X) to be developed in KDE's source repository. Trolltech has stated
its intention to include Phonon itself in Qt from version 4.4.
</p><p>
This is excellent news for the future of Phonon, signaling significant
amounts of funded development time, as Trolltech will be maintaining the
engines and contributing to Phonon.
</p><p>
KDE has long had a policy of leaving hardware support to the
distribution. Although KDE 3.x has very basic support for removable
storage devices with support for freedesktop.org's hardware abstraction
layer, HAL, in the 3.5 series, many KDE installations have less than
stellar hardware management due to the limitations of the distribution
implementation. Whether it's correct or not, to many users, the desktop
is the computer and their expectation is that it should handle their
hardware well.
</p><p>
Solid and Phonon look to overcome these issues, leveraging what user-space
support they find into as consistent an experience as possible for KDE
users, regardless of platform. Although the project has come under some
criticism for creating Yet Another Abstraction Layer, Solid and Phonon
make porting KDE to other platforms just a little bit easier. They
also remove a lot of the complexity in dealing with hardware from most
basic individual applications and keep it in a single place. Phonon isn't
considered to be a one-size-fits-all solution, however; it's recognised
that some applications may require more than Phonon's simplistic view
of the world, like professional music editing applications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbec580.0xce59a0"></a>Dolphin</h2></div></div><p>
Another major change for KDE 4 is the inclusion of Dolphin as the
default file manager. Konqueror's file management abilities still will 
be available for the nostalgic or power user. Some of Dolphin's
features include a &ldquo;breadcrumb&rdquo; style location bar and side panes for
information and tree or bookmark views.
</p><p>
Dolphin as a project focuses on usability and simplicity. One of the
larger benefits of including Dolphin is a long-sought-after separation
of configuration between the Web browser and the file manager. A standing
complaint among KDE users is the way that Konqueror's profiles mechanism
doesn't achieve adequate separation between roles. Rearranging the
toolbars in one profile would affect another, and bookmarks were the same
between the browser and the file manager. Possibly even more confusing,
clicking the Home button on the browser toolbar took one to the file
management view of the user's home directory.
</p><p>
Although Konqueror is an exceptionally powerful and flexible tool,
these configuration quirks were extremely frustrating to users
who expected their file manager and Web browser to behave as separate
applications. Not all flexibility is lost in the name of usability,
however;
Dolphin fully supports KDE's Kioslaves and Konqueror service menus.
</p><p>
There are myriad other changes to look forward to in the 4.x development
cycle, but it would require far more space than is available here to
detail them all. At the time of researching this article, KDE 4 was in
a release-candidate state, with features still in a state of flux.
</p><p>
KDE 4 has been promising a desktop revolution, and it really looks as
though it just might deliver. The first generation of new KDE technologies
is shaping up to transform our expectations of what the Linux desktop
should bring. When one considers that this is the state of the 4.0
release, and then looks at the length of the 3.x development cycle,
the path that the evolution of the 4.x series will take stimulates
the imagination.
