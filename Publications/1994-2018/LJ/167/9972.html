Securing Ubuntu is as straightforward as installing it.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x239b580.0x2493450"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For a couple years, I resisted my friends' attempts to get me to
check out Ubuntu. I thought, &ldquo;What's the big deal? It's just another
Debian derivative.&rdquo; But, of course, I was wrong. Ubuntu is remarkably easy
to install and use, and although it is indeed based on Debian, its emphasis
on usability and simplicity sets it apart.
</p><p>
Furthermore, both the Desktop and Server editions of Ubuntu use
dual-purpose live CDs that can be used either to install Ubuntu or 
run it from CD without affecting any other operating systems on your hard
disk. This makes it easy to test-drive Ubuntu before installing it
to your hard disk. (The live CD method of booting Linux has important,
useful security ramifications; however, that will be the topic of an entire
future column.)
</p><p>
So, I have been messing around with Ubuntu quite a bit lately and thought
you might enjoy a survey of its security capabilities.
</p><p>
First, a quick note about the scope of this article&mdash;I'm sticking to Ubuntu
Desktop; space doesn't permit me to include Ubuntu Server, but I might
cover it in a future column. Suffice it to say for now that Ubuntu
Server is a subset of Ubuntu Desktop, lacking the X Window System and
most other non-server-related software.
</p><p>
I also do not explicitly cover Kubuntu, which simply is Ubuntu running the
KDE desktop rather than GNOME; Edubuntu, which emphasizes educational
applications; or Xubuntu, which is Ubuntu with the Xfce desktop. Everything
I cover in this article should apply to these Ubuntu variants, but there may be
subtle differences here and there.
</p><p>
Note also that Gobuntu, an experimental subset of Ubuntu consisting
only of completely free/unencumbered software packages, probably has
considerably fewer security features and packages than Ubuntu
proper.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x239b580.0x2493818"></a>
Ubuntu vs. Debian</h2></div></div><p>
Ubuntu security isn't very far removed from Debian security; underneath
the GUI, Ubuntu is very similar to Debian. In this sense, Ubuntu shares
all of Debian's security <span   class="emphasis"><em>potential</em></span>, and then
some. If a given
security tool is available as a deb package that works correctly in
the current version of Debian, it also can be installed in the
current version of Ubuntu.
</p><p>
So, why dedicate an entire article to Ubuntu security? Two reasons. First,
because it has been more than a year since my last article on Debian
security. Second, Ubuntu has a few key differences from standard
Debian: its status as a live CD distribution (which among other things
makes it a good choice for running on untrusted hardware) and its ease of
use, which on the one hand, doesn't yet much apply to Ubuntu's security
features, but it does make Ubuntu more attractive to non-expert users than
Debian proper, amplify the ramifications of Ubuntu security. Ubuntu also uses AppArmor, a powerful means of restricting
d&aelig;mon behavior.
</p><p>
Software is the key difference between Debian and Ubuntu. I've long
been of the opinion that Debian's staggering array of software packages
is also one of its biggest challenges. Figuring out which of those
thousands of packages you need can be confusing even for expert
users. A key design goal of Ubuntu is, therefore, to support a smaller,
carefully selected subset of Debian's packages.
</p><p>
Ubuntu, however, doesn't merely rebundle standard Debian packages. Ubuntu
maintains its own versions, and according to Wikipedia, in many cases,
Debian and Ubuntu packages aren't even binary-compatible. (The Ubuntu
team has pledged to keep Ubuntu compatible with Debian by sharing all
changes it makes to Debian packages, but the Debian team has grumbled
about Ubuntu's team not being prompt enough in doing so.)
</p><p>
The biggest source of confusion I've experienced with
Ubuntu personally is that Ubuntu uses a different package repository schema than Debian,
and Ubuntu's own Web pages aren't terribly clear as to how it works. But,
it's actually straightforward.
</p><p>
The main repository consists of fully supported, free (unencumbered)
packages that are maintained by the Ubuntu team, the core of which is
employees of Canonical Ltd. The main repository, therefore, is the heart of Ubuntu.
</p><p>
The restricted repository consists of nonfree (copyrighted) packages
that are nonetheless fully supported and maintained, due to their critical
nature. The majority of these packages are commercial hardware drivers
that lack open-source equivalents.
</p><p>
The universe repository contains free software packages that are
not considered part of Ubuntu's core, and therefore, they are not fully
supported. The Ubuntu team takes no responsibility for security patches
for these packages; unlike those in the main repository, security
patches for universe are issued only when the software's developers
issue them.
</p><p>
The multiverse repository contains commercial or otherwise IP-encumbered
packages that are not part of Ubuntu's core, and it has the
least amount of support from the Ubuntu team. As with universe,
multiverse security updates are purely opportunistic.
</p><p>
In all four repositories, the vast majority of Ubuntu packages correspond
with Debian packages. But, again, because all Ubuntu packages are maintained
separately, don't assume it's safe to install a package
from the universe or multiverse repositories just because it's fully supported in
Debian. The Ubuntu team is committed to providing prompt security patches
only for the main and restricted repositories.
</p><p>
In my opinion, this is a perfectly justifiable trade-off, just as it
is in RHEL and CentOS&mdash;the fewer packages a distribution supports,
the greater the feasibility of supporting them <span   class="emphasis"><em>well</em></span>, and the
lesser the complexity of the distribution. High complexity and effective
security seldom go together. However, the fact that you can't rely on
timely security updates for universe and multiverse packages also
means that Ubuntu may not be the best choice for you if you're going to
depend heavily on packages from those repositories.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x239b580.0x2493df0"></a>
Ubuntu Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Now that I've explained how Ubuntu's repositories are structured, I can
describe how to use them. Obviously, there's a lot more to system security
than installing or not installing software. But, software is one of the
biggest, if not the biggest, differentiators between Linux distributions,
so it's a logical place to start.
</p><p>
One interesting thing about the Ubuntu Desktop installer is that at
initial setup/installation, it doesn't ask you which software packages
to install. It installs a static set of applications, and 
subsequently you can only add to or remove from it. Nor does the Ubuntu Desktop
installer configure firewall rules or allow you to set any other security
parameters, beyond creating the first nonroot user account.
</p><p>
Clearly, this installer emphasizes simplicity and
speed. Luckily, Ubuntu is configured with reasonably good security
by default.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x239b580.0x2493fa8"></a>
The Rootless Ubuntu Experience</h2></div></div><p>
For example, it isn't possible to log in as root. Instead, you log in
using an account with administrative privileges, such as that initial
account the installer creates for you, then you use the sudo command
to execute individual commands as root. (You can use the Users and
Groups applet in the System&rarr;Administration menu to grant or revoke
administrative privileges to users.)
</p><p>
Using sudo prompts you for your <span   class="emphasis"><em>own</em></span> password (the root account on Ubuntu
doesn't even have a password!), and then executes the given command. Graphical
programs in Ubuntu automatically use sudo and prompt you for your
password as needed.
</p><p>
Using sudo provides granular control over who can execute what privileged
commands. It also logs all commands it executes. Having the root account
present but essentially disabled also makes it somewhat more difficult for hostile
code to gain root access. In short, I heartily approve of this design
decision in Ubuntu. For more information, take a look at the Ubuntu RootSudo page
(see Resources).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x239b580.0x2494210"></a>
Installing Optional Software</h2></div></div><p>
Once you've installed Ubuntu, you can install additional software
packages as needed, using the Install and Remove Applications applet
(Add/Remove... in the Applications menu) or the Synaptic Package
Manager (in the System menu under Administration). Figure 1 shows
the Install and Remove Applications applet.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9972f1.large.jpg"><img src="9972f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Install and Remove Applications Applet (aka Add/Remove
Applications)
</p></div></div><p>
This applet is very simple to use, and it comes preconfigured with a set of
Ubuntu repositories on the Internet. If you want to install packages from
universe or multiverse, you need to enable this under Preferences. By default, only packages from main and restricted are shown.
</p><p>
Personally, I prefer the Synaptic Package Manager (Figure 2). It
handles dependencies more gracefully and offers more options for
filtering and listing packages. It also lists raw packages (all the
individual deb packages that make up an application), whereas the
Add/Remove Applications applet lists packages only by application name
(which isn't as precise). If installing an application involves four
separate component packages plus seven dependencies, I want to know it.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9972f2.large.jpg"><img src="9972f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Synaptic Package Manager
</p></div></div><p>
Note that both the Add/Remove Applications applet and the Synaptic
Package Manager use the Software Sources applet to obtain current
lists of available packages. You need to know this, because by default,
neither the universe nor multiverse repositories are enabled, and the
Software Source applet is where you enable them. In the Ubuntu desktop's
System menu, open the Administration submenu to find the Software
Sources applet. If you make changes in this applet, you'll be prompted
to download fresh package lists before quitting.
</p><p>
Before I discuss actual packages, here's one more note about obtaining
them: besides the Ubuntu repositories on the Internet, you also can install
packages from the Ubuntu Desktop 7.10 CD. However, beyond the packages
installed automatically, this CD contains only 29 additional packages
from main and three from restricted. Therefore, in practice, you'll have
to download most of the software you install after the initial system
installation.

Notable Ubuntu Packages</h2></div></div><p>
Ubuntu Desktop 7.10 automatically installs with a number of important
security-related software packages. Table 1 lists some of my favorites.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x239b580.0x24948f0"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. Security-Related Packages Installed by Default</b></p><table     summary="Table 1. Security-Related Packages Installed by Default9972t1.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>

I've mixed security-auditing tools (fping and tcpdump) alongside defense
tools (gnupg, SELinux and TCP Wrappers). Obviously, you need to give some
thought as to whether a given system is going to have an
&ldquo;offensive&rdquo; role
versus a &ldquo;defensive&rdquo; role with respect to security; security scanners
can be dangerous!
</p><p>
The main repository contains a wealth of additional security software
packages. Table 2 lists more of my favorites.

But wait, there's more! We've actually scratched only the surface. The
universe and multiverse repositories contain many, many more
security software packages. Table 3 lists a <span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> small subset of
these. Remember, the Ubuntu team offers no guarantee of timely security
patches for these packages.

As you can see, Ubuntu Desktop is an extremely versatile distribution. It
contains a wide variety of security tools, representing many different
ways to secure your system (and the network on which it resides).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x239b580.0x27a2768"></a>
Automatic Updates in Ubuntu Desktop</h2></div></div><p>
Once you've installed a bunch of software, keeping it patched is
easy. To configure automatic updates, run the Software Sources applet,
and select the Updates tab (Figure 3). These settings determine the
behavior of the Update Manager applet.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9972f3.large.jpg"><img src="9972f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Setting Up Automatic Updates in Ubuntu Desktop
</p></div></div><p>
The Update Manager applet runs automatically in the background, but you
also can start it manually from the System menu in the Administration
section. You can configure it (from Software Sources) to do any of the
following: 1) notify
you of updates, 2) download patches automatically and notify you
when they're ready for installation, or 3) download and install patches
automatically.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x239b580.0x27a2a80"></a>
Novell AppArmor in Ubuntu</h2></div></div><p>
Remember back in my August 2006 article &ldquo;An Introduction to Novell
AppArmor&rdquo;, when I commented that despite its SUSE roots, AppArmor 
probably would be ported to other distributions soon? (No? Well, I did say
that&mdash;you can look it up!) Sure enough, not only does Ubuntu have a
port of AppArmor, but it's also installed and enabled by default.
</p><p>
If you're unfamiliar with it, AppArmor is an implementation of Type
Enforcement, a type of Mandatory Access Control. What this means in
English is that AppArmor lets you restrict the activities of system
d&aelig;mons&mdash;what files they can read, which directories they can access,
which devices they can write to or read from and so on. It is a powerful
means of containing the effects if a protected d&aelig;mon is
compromised&mdash;even if attackers succeed in hijacking a given process, they can't
use it to execute arbitrary commands, read arbitrary files and so forth.
</p><p>
Perhaps surprisingly, given Ubuntu's very slick look and feel, AppArmor
is configurable in Ubuntu only via the command line, using the aa
tools (aa-status, aa-genprof and so on) in the apparmor-utils package.
Visit
the Ubuntu AppArmor page for more information (see Resources).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x239b580.0x27a2ce8"></a>
Managing Users and Groups</h2></div></div><p>
In the root/sudo discussion above, I mentioned the Users and Groups
applet. This applet is deceptively simple to use. It's actually one of
the more sophisticated front ends to adduser, addgroup and so on that
I've seen. If you select a user, click Properties, and click the
User Privileges tab, you can not only grant that user the right to
&ldquo;Administer the system&rdquo; (that is, to execute commands as root
using sudo),
you also can select from a long list of other system privileges (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9972f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Setting User Privileges in Ubuntu
</p></div></div><p>
If you're an old-school sysadmin like me, you know that none of these
privileges are handled directly by tools like adduser; the settings in
this part of the applet simply determine to which groups the user
belongs&mdash;groups that the Ubuntu team carefully has configured to correspond with
real-world system administration-related commands and objects. This is
a clever and simple way to manage administrative functions, especially
in combination with sudo.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x239b580.0x2a1ed38"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
As you can see, Ubuntu's ease of use doesn't come at the cost of
security&mdash;it has Debian's abundance of security-related software
packages
combined with straightforward but effective security design decisions,
such as disabled root and AppArmor, and easy update management.
