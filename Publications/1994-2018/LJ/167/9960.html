When Lotus Symphony faces the music, the question becomes, &ldquo;Do we really
need another proprietary office suite based on OpenOffice.org?&rdquo;
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25a7580.0x269f348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Talking about IBM Lotus Symphony in any meaningful way is impossible
without constant references to OpenOffice.org. Consisting of three
applications&mdash;the self-explanatory Documents, Presentations and
Spreadsheets&mdash;Symphony is not only a proprietary rival to OpenOffice.org in
the cross-platform office space, but also is based on OpenOffice.org code, a
move made possible by OpenOffice.org's release under the GNU Lesser General
Public License. Under these circumstances, comparing the two applications
is by far the quickest and most accurate way to explore Symphony's general
features and interface, as well as what new features it adds to the
codebase and what it leaves out.
</p><p>
To say the least, the result is mixed.
</p><p>
Specifically, Symphony is the OpenOffice.org 1.14 code dropped into an
Eclipse framework, without any attempt to include the various add-ons
available for the original. The version choice has the advantage of
ensuring that Symphony is based on a mature codebase, and the reliance
on Java sidesteps the need to bring developers up to speed on every
intricacy of OpenOffice.org's notoriously cryptic code.
</p><p>
However, these choices also extract a price. For one thing, version 1.14
is two years old and missing many of the improvements in the 2.x releases.
These include such features as version 2.3's new chart system, the ability
to use movie and sound clips in presentations, and the expansion and
improvement of the on-line help. All that Symphony seems to have borrowed
from later releases is the enhanced drawing toolbar.
</p><p>
As for any add-ons, forget them. Symphony does not even include
ExtendedPDF, which gives users expanded control over exports to
PDF.
Although Symphony does allow exports to PDF, the feature is basic compared
to the one offered in the latest versions of OpenOffice.org in most
distributions, which install ExtendedPDF by default.
</p><p>
Similarly, although reliance on Java may speed development&mdash;IBM boasts
that the current beta 2 was developed in less than two months&mdash;it does
not make for compact apps without careful coordination of development.
Symphony's installation size is huge&mdash;683MB compared to less than 200MB for
recent versions of OpenOffice.org, even though it does not include versions
of OpenOffice.org's drawing, database and equation editors. Symphony's
start-up speed is slow too, taking at least twice as long as the latest
versions of OpenOffice.org using the same equipment. Although these figures
may improve in later releases, they seem unlikely to match OpenOffice.org's
any time soon.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25a7580.0x269f710"></a>
The Interface</h2></div></div><p>
Despite improvements during the last two years, including a change from
battleship gray to beige, OpenOffice.org's interface has never been an
example of beauty. It tends to be ramshackle, never sure if it should
borrow from MS Office and other proprietary apps or develop its own design.
Nor has any attempt been made to enforce design standards, which means that
new features, such as the dictionary and font installers, follow a logic of
their own. If there ever was a program that demanded an interface
redesign, it was OpenOffice.org.
</p><p>
And, at first glance, Symphony provides that redesign. Its selection of
blues with the occasional orange highlight may be chosen mainly for IBM
branding, but the overall effect is much more unified and pleasant to the
eye than anything OpenOffice.org has managed to offer so far. However,
this unity is mainly on the surface. Open a dialog box, and you are back
with OpenOffice.org's familiar, starkly functional designs.
</p><p>
In much the same way, Symphony attempts to edit and rearrange
OpenOffice.org's menus. Because many OpenOffice.org features are omitted (see
below), Symphony can hardly help but have shorter menus, making them easier
to use. In fact, Symphony even has the space to make some features more
prominent, dragging the Direct Cursor out of Tools&rarr;Options to place it
in the Edit menu, or to make page numbering a top-level item rather than
hiding it among Insert&rarr;Fields to the puzzlement of new users. Such
changes can only increase ease of use.
</p><p>
Too often though, the changes seem arbitrary. Replacing Format Cells
with Text and Cell Properties in Spreadsheets does nothing for clarity,
any more than replacing the Format menu with Layout or the Insert
menu with Create does. And, is there any reason for labeling spreadsheets with
letters instead of OpenOffice.org's numbers?
</p><p>
The same mixture of usefulness and arbitrariness occurs with the
positioning of items. Moving the Options item from the Tools menu to the
File menu (where it is called Preferences) seems sensible, because the
File menu is where you expect to find basic setup settings. But, why shift
page setup from Format/Layout to the File menu? The fact that MS Word used
to do so hardly seems reason enough.
</p><p>
A more concrete improvement is Symphony's borrowing of a Web browser
format, opening on a useless Home page and opening new documents by default
in tabs in the same window. From there, a document can be opened in a
separate window via a right-click. This arrangement is enhanced
further by a thumbnail view of documents in the Window menu, which can be set to
view only a specific type of document.
</p><p>
However, the addition of a docked Properties window on the right side of
the editing window is less useful. This window displays elements that
are selectable from the menu in OpenOffice.org, showing Text and Paragraph
settings in Documents, Page settings in Presentations and cell settings in
Spreadsheets. Anyone familiar with OpenOffice.org might wonder not only
about the advisability of another floating window to add to the Navigator,
Styles and Formatting, Gallery and Data Sources (although Symphony
eliminates Data Sources), but also why the Properties window is so important
that it is the only floating window that can be docked on the right side of
the editing window.
</p><p>
Even more important, the effect of showing the Properties window by
default is to encourage manual formatting at the expense of styles.
Particularly in the word processor, this emphasis is equivalent to teaching
someone to make hand signals when learning to drive and not bothering to
mention the signal light. More than any other office suite, OpenOffice.org
relies on styles, with several features, such as tables of contents and
outlines, being much more difficult to use if you rely on manual
formatting.
</p><p>
Perhaps the Properties window is in response to OpenOffice.org users who
do not want to be forced into using styles (as though styles were anything
except a time-saver for them), but its prominence suggests that Symphony's
designers do not understand the logic of the program they are mutating. If
you are using the code the way it was intended to be used, the Properties
floating window is an irrelevance.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25a7580.0x269fb30"></a>
Missing Features</h2></div></div><p>
To those familiar with OpenOffice.org, one of the distinguishing
characteristics of Symphony is how many features have been ripped out. In
all the applications, the list is a long one.
</p><p>
To start with, many features for interoperability are missing. For
instance, unlike in OpenOffice.org, in Symphony you cannot store data for
use in other documents, embed one document in another or export a list of
headers in the word processor to create the slides in a presentation.
</p><p>
In Documents, the list of the missing continues. All wizards are gone,
as well as any capacity to create labels, business cards or anything else
that requires a mail merge. No Autotext, bibliographies, hyphenation,
thesaurus, outline numbering, autoformats for tables or master
documents are available. Neither are many types of fields, including ones
for hidden paragraphs or text, input lists, document information or user
data.
</p><p>
Presentations and Spreadsheets are somewhat less devastated. Still,
Presentations lacks the initial wizard or any sound support, and
Spreadsheets lacks the ability to split or freeze windows to improve the viewing
of long documents or to autoformat selected cells. However, in
Presentations, you might think that more is missing than really is the
case, because
many items are concealed in main and right-click menus, and combo boxes for
things such as slide transitions list only a half-dozen items at a time and
require clicking Other to see other selections.
</p><p>
In none of the three programs can you edit keyboard shortcuts or
customize menus and toolbars. You still can run macros, but without these
customizing features, they are less accessible. Instead of assigning them
to keystrokes or adding them to the toolbar, you have to drill down through
several levels of menus in order to use them.
</p><p>
What is left is enough for most users in undemanding circumstances. Still,
the logic behind what is omitted is obscure. Although the tendency is
to exclude anything that requires instruction to learn or increases users'
ability to customize, perhaps the true reason is to trim the hard drive
requirements as much as possible.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25a7580.0x269fdf0"></a>
New Features and Old</h2></div></div><p>
Against these omissions, Symphony boasts only a handful of innovations. The
single window for opening applications includes a Web browser accessible
from the New button, but this hardly seems the time to introduce one.
OpenOffice.org dropped its Web browser when its code was first released,
and the integration of applications on GNU/Linux desktops is strong enough
that nobody has missed it since.
</p><p>
Otherwise, new features&mdash;as opposed to ones made more prominent by
repositioning&mdash;are surprisingly few in Symphony's applications. Aside
from the single window with search and thumbnail features, probably the
main addition is the Freehand Table feature it borrows from MS Office. And
this feature, although showy, is slow and impractical compared to choosing the
number of rows and columns by dragging the mouse over a grid.
</p><p>
However, Presentations does include one legacy feature that longtime
OpenOffice.org users might still be pining for: the arrangement of slides
in tabs. This arrangement is more economical with space than the slide pane
that replaced it in OpenOffice.org's Impress, allowing much more room to
display the currently active slide. But, this feature is hardly enough to
attract users by itself.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25a7580.0x269ffa8"></a>
A Lack of Purpose</h2></div></div><p>
How Lotus Symphony fits into IBM's corporate strategy is anybody's
guess. Perhaps it is a matter of corporate pride, an attempt to revive a
product line that was a contender in the office application market more
than a
decade ago? A desire to support open standards by releasing programs that
support the Open Document format?
</p><p>
If the intent is to undermine MS Office's dominance on the desktop, as
some have alleged, then as an under-featured, proprietary application,
Symphony seems to have poor odds for success. So far, at least, there is
not even any evidence that Symphony will integrate with Lotus Notes to
offer the combination of office applications and calendaring that
OpenOffice.org lacks. IBM would strike a greater strategic blow if it
contributed directly to the latest version of OpenOffice.org instead of
focusing on what seems a quixotic and halfhearted project at best.
</p><p>
That, in the end, is why Symphony disappoints. As a project,
OpenOffice.org badly needs some fresh ideas. Its interface probably needs
redesigning from the ground up, both in terms of names and positioning of
features. Some features deserve to be more prominent, while some may be no
longer relevant or require radical redesign. Symphony attempts all these
things, but with no clear vision and only halfheartedly.
</p><p>
In the end, all Symphony offers is a version of OpenOffice.org stripped
to the basics and suitable mainly for those who won't take the time to
learn to use office applications properly. Such an outcome is disappointing
for those who would like to see OpenOffice.org undertake some basic
improvements, and not nearly sufficient to justify Symphony's independent
existence.
