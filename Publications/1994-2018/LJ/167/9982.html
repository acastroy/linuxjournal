You have been on the phone for an hour, Fran&ccedil;ois, and it is nearly
time for our guests to arrive. Who are you talking to? Your cousin in
Riviere-du-Loup? And, you're helping her with her Linux system? That
is commendable, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>, but we have work to do. Yes,
I realize
it takes a great deal of time when you have to ask the other person to
describe what she sees while you try to tell her what she should do
next. It might be easier to demonstrate. Yes, I know she lives a few
hundred kilometers away. With your Linux system and the right tools,
being there doesn't have to mean hours and hours of driving. Wrap up
your call quickly, and you'll learn everything you need to know when I
serve up today's menu. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite!</em></span> Our guests are arriving
as we speak.
</p><p>
Welcome, everyone, to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>. It is a great
pleasure
to have you here, where fine Linux and open-source software meets great
wine. Please, sit, while my faithful waiter takes a short trip to the wine
cellar. Fran&ccedil;ois, please bring back the Collavini 2005 Villa Canlungo
Pinot Grigio. Quickly, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>.
</p><p>
It only makes sense that being there, in person, to show somebody how
to work with his or her system isn't always convenient. Taking control of
an existing remote desktop session lets you work with the desktop
as though you were there, without having to walk up a floor or drive
several hundred miles. In that respect, it's not only a time-saver, but
also environmentally-friendly (imagine having to fly overseas). Another
great incentive for remote control is the office environment. Do you
need to show users how to add an icon to their desktops? Connect to
their desktops and let them watch. Have you received a call asking
for help interpreting an error message? Connect to the system and ask
the user to re-create the scenario while you watch. The possibilities are
endless. Taking control of a remote desktop also provides everyone with a
learning experience. For you, the person doing the teaching, it lets
users show exactly how whatever went wrong, went wrong. For users,
it lets them watch a master at work, so they too can learn the ways
of Linux. This remote control is probably better referred to
as desktop sharing.
</p><p>
Excellent, Fran&ccedil;ois has returned with the wine. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon
ami</em></span>,
after you have taken care of filling our guests' glasses, please take
care of mine as well.
</p><p>
Both of the most popular Linux desktop environments&mdash;KDE and
GNOME&mdash;come equipped with excellent solutions for desktop sharing.
With these
tools, users can invite someone either to watch their desktop session or
take control of it. In an office environment, system
administrators also can
set it up so they can take control whenever necessary. Let's
start this tour with the KDE desktop sharing application.
</p><p>
On my Kubuntu Linux system, remote desktop sharing is under the
Internet menu. The command name is <tt  >krfb</tt>, if you want
to start
it directly using your Alt-F2 run dialog. When you do so, a window labeled
Invitation - Krfb appears (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9982f1.large.jpg"><img src="9982f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Invitations to desktop sharing come in different flavors.
</p></div></div><p>
The window offers you three important choices. You can create either
a New Personal Invitation or Invite via Email. The third button provides
a more complex interface that allows you access to invitations that already
have
been created. You can delete existing invitations or create new
personal invitations. There's also a Configure button at the bottom&mdash;a
button that is of particular importance to system administrators. Let's
leave those things for now and concentrate on creating a personal
invitation. To do that, click the Create Personal Invitation button, and a
window labeled Personal Invitation - Krfb appears (Figure
2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9982f2.large.jpg"><img src="9982f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. When you create a personal invitation, it expires an hour later.
</p></div></div><p>
For security reasons, the invitation itself lasts only an hour. If
you don't do anything else, Desktop Sharing automagically comes up with
a password and an expiration time for the session. The host address
necessary for the connection also is displayed. Overriding either the
password or the expiration time is not allowed. Make sure you pass on
the information as it is shown to the person who will be connecting. When
you have passed on the information (or written it down), click Close.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2343580.0x243bdf0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
The IP address displayed may be an issue if you
are trying to connect to a remote system that is on the other side of
a home router or firewall. In those instances, you may need to set
up a port redirect to allow port 5900 to connect to the PC you need
to access. Because the way to do this varies from ISP to ISP and router
manufacturer to router manufacturer, there isn't a quick way to explain
it here. Your router documentation should cover this.
</p></div><p>
The other option is an e-mail invitation, which is essentially the
same thing, except the connection details are sent via e-mail rather than
read over the phone. The only catch here is that you are sending the means
to
access your system via e-mail during that one-hour period. If you choose
this option, you'll receive a warning about plain-text e-mail over the
Internet and the wisdom of encrypting said e-mail. Click Continue to get
past the warning, and a KMail message appears (with instructions on how to
connect), ready for you to click Send. If no one answers the invitation,
it disappears within an hour.
</p><p>
Before we move on, click Close to get past all those invitations, and
we'll have a look at another means of providing access&mdash;uninvited
connections (that's our mysterious Configure button). If sending an e-mail
invitation presents interesting security concerns, a wide-open,
permanent invitation should ring additional bells. Nevertheless,
in an
office environment, it also may be the sanest method of giving yourself
access. Click the Configure button to bring up the Configure dialog
from the KDE Control Centre (Figure 3). Yes, that is correct. This
configuration dialog also is available by running the KDE Control Centre
from the K menu (or by using the <tt  >kcontrol</tt> command
name) and
looking under the Internet &amp; Network menu for
Desktop
Sharing.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9982f3.large.jpg"><img src="9982f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Creating a persistent, uninvited connection adds convenience, but
don't
ignore security.
</p></div></div><p>
If you check the Allow uninvited connections box, you still have to
assign a password for connecting. Furthermore, you have the opportunity to
&ldquo;Confirm uninvited connections before accepting&rdquo;. You also can
decide whether to
give those uninvited connections the ability to control the desktop. If
you don't check the latter, users can give you control at any time
by selecting the desktop sharing icon that appears in their system tray.
</p><p>
On the GNOME side of things, there's a program called Remote Desktop
Sharing. On a typical GNOME setup, click System on the top menu bar,
then look under Preferences for Remote Desktop (if you like, you can
run the command directly using
<tt  >/usr/lib/vino/vino-server</tt>). The
Remote Desktop Preferences menu appears as shown in Figure 4. Needless to
say,
I love the name.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9982f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. GNOME's
remote desktop invitation is run by a command named vino-server. Suddenly,
I'm thirsty.
</p></div></div><p>
Some of this is going to look very familiar, because many of the
questions mirror those of the KDE Control Centre configuration for desktop
sharing. If you simply want to show what your desktop is doing (and let
somebody
follow along), click the Allow other users to view your desktop
check box. If you are looking for help, or you want to help the person
on the other end, make sure the person sharing checks the Allow box,
second from the top. Users who want to leave a sharing session open all
the time may decide to check the Ask you for confirmation button, so
that a remote user has to have their permission. Finally, if this is an
unattended connection, you'll surely want to assign a password to allow
this connection to happen. Although it may not seem apparent here, you
also can generate an e-mail invitation by clicking the command listed under
Users can view your desktop using this command.
</p><p>
To connect to a remote shared desktop, you can use any VNC client&mdash;the
GNOME vino-server program suggests <tt  >vncviewer</tt> as the
command to
use&mdash;including a Java-enabled browser. The invitation e-mail tells you
how to do this. The slicker, desktop-oriented way to do this is by using
the tools provided by your desktop environment. The KDE Remote Desktop
Connection program (Krdc) can be started from the Internet K
Menu, where you'll see it listed as Remote Desktop Connection. From the
dialog that pops up, you can enter the host connection information as
shown in Figure 5.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9982f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Connecting
with the KDE remote connection program&mdash;note the :0 at the end
of the address.
</p></div></div><p>
The connection program can be used simply by entering the sharing
host's address and pressing Connect. Another window appears asking
you to specify the quality of your connection&mdash;whether it be a fast
LAN
connection, a slow dial-up connection or something in between. When you
do connect, what happens depends on how the invitation was created. If
the confirm option was set, a warning message appears on the remote
desktop asking for confirmation. On the client side, you then may be
asked for a password.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2343580.0x243c948"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
KDE client programs can connect to GNOME desktops
and vice versa.
</p></div><p>
On the GNOME side of things, remote connections are done with the
Terminal Server Client program (Figure 6). You'll find it under
Applications in the Internet menu, but you also can run it directly with
<tt  >tsclient</tt>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9982f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. The GNOME Terminal Server Client Program
</p></div></div><p>
The Terminal Server Client has five tabs, the most important of which
is the General tab. Enter the remote computer's address (including the
:0 display extension as shown by the desktop sharing server program),
and make sure you select VNC as the protocol from the drop-down list. For
these remote desktop sessions, you simply can click Connect and be done. As
with the KDE client, the remote user may need to confirm the session
(which may require you to enter a password) and then manually give you
control of the mouse and keyboard. The additional tabs allow you to
define your display size, set color depth or modify some
performance-related parameters. Incidentally,
both the KDE remote client and the
GNOME Terminal Server Client also let you connect to an RDP session as
well.
</p><p>
Once a session is open, a tray icon appears in your system tray. The
GNOME icon looks like a small terminal screen (Figure 7), and the
default KDE tray icon (Figure 8) looks like a screen with a globe in
front of it. In both cases, you can right-click on the tray icon where
a drop-down or pop-up menu will show you active connections and give
you a means to terminate them.

Figure 8. The KDE desktop
sharing system tray icon (top right next to the clock) lets you manage
connections and desktop control.
</p></div></div><p>
Once you have established a connection, the remote system becomes a
window on your current desktop. You can switch to full-screen mode, or
as is the case with the KDE client, you can drag the window to any size
you desire, then click the Scale button to resize the remote
control session dynamically (Figure 9).

Despite the many advantages of doing things at a distance, there
is only one way to enjoy a glass of wine, and that is by being
there. Luckily, Fran&ccedil;ois, our most excellent waiter, is not elsewhere,
but right here in this restaurant. As the clock ticks ever closer to
closing time, I'm sure we can convince him to let us enjoy a little more
wine before we head to our respective homes. If you please, Fran&ccedil;ois,
make sure everyone's glass is refilled.
Raise your glasses, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, and let us all drink to
one
another's health. <span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute;! Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
