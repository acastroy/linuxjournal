An easy-to-love, ultraportable PC.

The ASUS Eee PC is an extremely small, ultraportable notebook at the
cheapest end of the market. At $399 US, it's supremely affordable. The
entire industry has been buzzing around it, with Asus claiming that it was
America's most popular Christmas gift.

</p><p>
When we arrived at the store to pick up our Eee to review, all the
salespeople were busy. We looked near the laptops for it and couldn't
see it&mdash;had the shipment been delayed?
</p><p>
We finally snared a salesperson to ask about the Eee and were led to the
small electronics cabinet. There, nestled among the compact cameras and
iPods,
was one of the smallest laptops we'd ever seen. Its box was 
also diminutive. Inside the box is the Eee, manuals, CD, charger,
neoprene sleeve and the Eee's battery. We appreciated the inclusion of the
sleeve&mdash;most notebook bag and case makers have nothing for a machine this
small.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cb7580.0x1daf500"></a>
First Impressions</h2></div></div><p>
Asthetically, the Eee looks like exactly what it is&mdash;a miniature laptop. Ours
came in pearl white. It drew comments and admiring glances everywhere we
took it&mdash;for both its extremely small size and smooth
styling. The
only aspect that mars its appearance is a large screen bezel. We feel the
Eee would be vastly improved cosmetically if the screen filled even half 
that bezel. But, that's a minor issue in an otherwise very attractive
notebook.

The Eee has a nice touchpad, although a little small. There is a single-width
button that will execute a right-click if you press down on the right-hand
side. We found this a little difficult to get used to, as it was hard to
tell without looking exactly where you were about to click. The touchpad
will scroll if one traces a finger down the far right&mdash;an extremely small
target we found difficult to hit reliably. We've read a lot of reviews that seem
displeased with the keyboard, and frankly, we just can't see why. The
keyboard has an excellent feel to it, although again, it is extremely small.
It took less than an hour to get used to touch-typing on it at
quite a reasonable speed.
</p><p>
The screen is LED-backlit, making it extremely bright. Unfortunately, that's
the only kind thing we can say about it. The contrast and colour is
dreadful, and although the screen is a reasonable DPI, the resolution is just
not high enough for Web browsing. Most sites these days are optimised for
at least a 1024x768 resolution, and having a screen only 800 pixels wide
made us 
scroll sideways fairly often to see whole pages.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9947f1.large.jpg"><img src="9947f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Web browsing shows how cramped the Eee screen is.
</p></div></div><p>
The speakers are surprisingly good. Sure, the sound isn't studio-quality,
but the volume can be maxed out without distortion, and the clarity is
acceptable. With good headphones, sound is even
better,
although it did have a slightly muddy quality. The headphone socket is
extremely clean with no discernible hiss even at high volumes. The internal
microphone is adequate for voice chat, and plugging in a headset with an
external microphone works exactly as you'd expect.
</p><p>
Connectivity is excellent with 10/100 Ethernet, 802.11b/g wireless and
three USB ports. There's also an SD card slot on the left-hand side, and the
card sits flush with the side of the laptop. It supports SDHC cards, which
is a very viable option for expanding the onboard storage. There's also a
VGA-out port that displays up to 1280x1024 on an external display with
excellent acceleration. This feature alone makes the Eee far more
worthwhile for serious use, as the mediocre internal display becomes
an acceptable compromise&mdash;having a tiny device to carry around, but a
reasonable screen resolution while at home.

Software</h2></div></div><p>
ASUS's customised &ldquo;easy&rdquo; interface is built on Xandros and consists of a
tabbed desktop application launcher and the IceWM window manager and panel.
The interface is slick and well optimised for the low screen resolution. A
home key on the keyboard where the Windows key usually is minimises
all applications and reveals the program launcher. It's pretty clear ASUS
anticipates that most people will be running applications maximised. The launcher
tabs are divided into Internet, Work, Learn, Play, Settings and
Favourites.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9947f2.large.jpg"><img src="9947f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. ASUS &ldquo;Easy&rdquo; Interface
</p></div></div><p>
The Internet tab includes launchers for Firefox, Skype and the Pidgin
instant-messaging client, as well as some shortcuts for loading Firefox with a
preconfigured page to access services, such as Wikipedia, various Webmail
providers and Internet radio. The version of Skype installed does not
support video chat, which we feel to be a fairly glaring omission for a
device with a built-in Webcam.
</p><p>
The Work applications include Thunderbird for e-mail, KDE's Kontact suite for
PIM and Adobe's Linux Acrobat Reader software. OpenOffice.org version 2.0
is available, and it performs surprisingly well given Eee's limited
resources. One feature that isn't immediately apparent, but mentioned in
the manual, is that a terminal can be accessed with the keybinding
Ctrl-Alt-T. SSH and rdesktop are two applications that can be accessed this
way for those who are terminal-savvy.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9947f3.large.jpg"><img src="9947f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Kontact's excellent PIM suite is a little squished.
</p></div></div><p>
KDE's edutainment suite is well represented under the Learn tab with
science-,
language- and math-related educational tools from the project included. Tux
Typing, Tux Math and Tux Paint complete the selection. With the addition of
on-line learning facilities, we feel the Eee would make an excellent
educational aid.
</p><p>
The Play tab includes quite a few subcategories for various types of
media. A basic image viewer (Gwenview) is included, as well as an excellent
MPlayer front end capable of viewing most multimedia formats. We found
that getting high-quality, full-screen, highly compressed media content was quite the struggle,
but with a bit of practice, we're sure we can encode some video files that
the Eee will play well. DVD content off an external drive plays reasonably.
</p><p>
We were very pleased to see some of our favourite procrastination-enablers
under the Games tab. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Frozen Bubble</em></span> is insanely
addictive, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Crack Attack</em></span> looks
like it will be second on the list of &ldquo;Reasons This Review Will Almost
Certainly Be Late&rdquo;. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Penguin Racer</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Potato Guy</em></span> are old-fashioned
favourites, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Solitaire</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sudoku</em></span>
and a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tetris</em></span> clone round out the
selection.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9947f4.large.jpg"><img src="9947f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. How can a game this simple be so insanely addictive?
</p></div></div><p>
The Settings tab allows for minimum configurability&mdash;here are
options for setting up printers, configuring the touchpad and checking for
updates, among others. We eagerly looked through the personalisation dialog but
were disappointed to see it did not allow us to change the theme to
one that does not attempt to model Microsoft Windows XP's much-hated style.
The tool to enable an external display is simple and straightforward&mdash;something we certainly haven't found on other Linux desktops.
</p><p>
The Favourites tab lets us create launchers to our favourite applications,
although there was no way of creating a launcher to an application that
wasn't already on another tab. The option to create a custom launcher would
be appreciated.
</p><p>
The first thing we tried was connecting to various wireless networks,
using a USB GSM modem. For some unknown reason, there actually are two
networking tools installed on the Eee: one that can scan and connect to
wireless networks, and one that handles all other connections and
saved profiles for wireless networks. It took quite a few connections where
we had to enter the key in every single time before we discovered 
the second tool, with the key saved. It seems utterly needless to
have two separate tools for this when the various Network Manager front ends
are an excellent example of an all-in-one tool that's painless to use.
Hopefully, ASUS will merge these tools in a later release.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9947f5.large.jpg"><img src="9947f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Networking Tools
</p></div></div><p>
We were blown away by how easy it was to configure a USB 3G modem&mdash;the
connection wizard did almost all of the work for us, and we were on-line
within five minutes. Powering the modem seems to reduce the battery life to
about two and a half hours, but we still were impressed that the laptop and modem are 
less than 1kg to carry around. Battery life in general is a bit of a
sore point. The Eee gets a little more than three hours in our testing, if it's on
wireless, and we feel this just isn't really enough for an ultraportable.
That said, the power adapter for the Eee is quite small; it looks a bit
like an oversized cell-phone charger. Carrying the charger to top up
the Eee whenever you happen to see a power point really doesn't add much
weight or bulk.
</p><p>
Although we appreciate that the Eee could include only so much for the
price,
it would have been nice to see Bluetooth support and a larger screen. At
the end of the day though, every time we thought of a way the Eee could
be improved, we kept coming back to the price&mdash;$399. The
cheapest ultraportable from other vendors is closer to $1,200, and those 
aren't as small or totable as the Eee. It's no wonder that the Eee is
taking off so quickly and developing such a following. Out of the box,
it's a compelling little appliance.
</p><p>
Most of the Eee's downsides are eliminated when you see how the
machine can be customized. With some custom packages and a full Linux
desktop, the Eee is a formidable tool for the intermediate Linux
user.
In my opinion, the Eee is five minutes away from being a great
backup writing and open-source development tool. Install Subversion, add a
USB HSDPA modem, and I'd have an extremely portable, very cheap and rugged
tool for basic hacking tasks and for writing articles&mdash;most of this article
was written on the Eee, sitting in various caf&eacute;s around Wellington. With a
USB-to-serial adapter and the addition of minicom, it would be a great tool to
take into server rooms to aid me in my day job as a sleep-deprived systems
administrator. It's been my constant companion for the past few
weeks&mdash;coming with me to places I wouldn't dare to risk my far-more-expensive
and delicate Sony Vaio. Throw it in a backpack or even a large handbag, and
it's ready and waiting. I'd far rather risk spilling beer on it at
a pub hackfest, getting knocked around in my carry-on luggage or being taken
to conferences where I have an absolute gift for having computers stolen.
Although $399 isn't cheap enough to make it disposable, it's far more so than
something costing $2,000.
</p><p>
Next month, I'll take you through various ways the Eee
can be hacked to unlock the full power of the Linux it's running
underneath, and I'll also take a look at trying different Linux distributions on
it.
