IRC is still popular among techies, but it's not friendly to mobile
devices. Here are some tips on making it more effective when you're
on the run.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xff3580.0x10eb1f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is one of the older real-time communications
methods still in active use on the Internet. Due to its popularity,
flexibility and cross-platform nature, it still has a very vibrant user
base today. Personally, I've been on IRC since the late 1990s, and it's
been very useful and lots of fun&mdash;particularly the #linuxjournal room
on Freenode&mdash;stop in sometime!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xff3580.0x10eb3b0"></a>
Drawbacks to IRC</h2></div></div><p>
As great as IRC can be, there's one thing about it that's always bothered
me, and it's something that Jabber got right&mdash;the concept of a resource
and priority. In IRC, when you log in as whatever user you are, you can't
log in as that user again from another machine. Jabber allows multiple
user logins, so long as the &ldquo;resource&rdquo; is different, and it'll route
your messages to the client with the lowest priority. IRC doesn't even
have that concept, so once you log in on your desktop, you have to log in
as another user if you want to log in on your laptop, which results in
lots of logins like &ldquo;WildBill|Laptop&rdquo; and such. This causes a problem
if people want to private-message (PM) you, as they never know what
login you're on.
</p><p>
For years, I've used a fairly common workaround to bypass this problem
to a certain degree. If you use a text-based client like Irssi, and
run that client on a machine that's on all the time, you can run the
client within a terminal multiplexer, such as GNU Screen. That gives
you the ability to run the client, detach from the terminal session,
then log in via SSH on another machine and reattach to your session,
where you can catch up on what you may have missed. By and large, this
is an acceptable workaround...except when I forget to log in to that
Screen session. I've been known to have a few days' worth of PMs piled
up before I remember to log in and check. By that time, people who PM'd me
probably forgot what they pinged me about.
</p><p>
The other major flaw with this scheme is that it doesn't work well with
mobile devices like tablets and mobile phones. Yes, I could SSH from
my iPhone to my Linux server and attach to that Screen session with
Irssi running in it, but a terminal emulator on a 3.5" screen, where
a good portion of the screen is taken up with an on-screen keyboard,
is a recipe for a headache. There are excellent IRC clients
for mobile phones, like Colloquy on the iPhone, Yaaic for Android
and wIRC for WebOS, but if you run them while you have a Screen session
going, you're back to the same problem mentioned above where you wind up with a
&ldquo;WildBill|Phone&rdquo; login. There simply <span   class="emphasis"><em>had</em></span> to be a better way.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xff3580.0x10eb720"></a>
Is There a Better Way?</h2></div></div><p>
It turns out, after noodling around for a while one day, I did find a
way. Irssi, the text-mode client I usually use via Screen and SSH, has
a &ldquo;proxy&rdquo; (or &ldquo;bouncer&rdquo;) mode where you can have it listen on a couple
additional ports and then attach another IRC client to it. Enabling
the proxy is relatively easy, and it can be done from within Irssi with
only
a few commands (assuming your Irssi is packaged and includes the proxy
module). This also assumes you have Irssi already configured to work properly
with whichever IRC networks you wish. Of course, substitute your
own password for &ldquo;mypassword&rdquo;, define whatever IRC
networks you want
to proxy with Irssi, and pick an arbitrary open port on which to have the proxy
listen:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/LOAD proxy
/SET irssiproxy_password mypassword
/SET irssiproxy_ports linuxjournal=9000
/SAVE
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you get the proxy module running successfully, connecting to
it is as easy as pointing another IRC client at it. Just specify the
fully qualified domain name of the host running your Irssi client in
your second IRC client's configuration, and give it the password and
ports you called out in the Irssi commands above. This client can be a
&ldquo;regular&rdquo; desktop or laptop, or it can be a mobile device, such as an
Android phone or an iPad running an IRC client.
</p><p>
Although this works just fine, it bothers me a little bit, as the password
that's sent between the mobile device and your Irssi session that's
running in Screen is sent in the clear. I'd much prefer that to be
SSL-encrypted, so no one can intercept that password. Unfortunately,
the Irssi proxy module doesn't support SSL, but there's a way around
that through the use of the stunnel utility.
</p><p>
Stunnel is a generic encryption wrapper that's designed to add SSL
encryption to any non-encrypted service. It's not hard to wrap the Irssi
proxy service with stunnel. First, to prevent anyone on the outside from
accessing the proxy without SSL, I bound the ports on the Irssi proxy
to the loopback interface using the following Irssi command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/SET irssiproxy_bind 127.0.0.1
/SAVE
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, use your distribution's method for installing stunnel. On Ubuntu
10.04, a simple <tt  >sudo apt-get install stunnel4</tt> took care of that. I
had to create a self-signed SSL certificate (see Resources 
for a how-to on this), and I put that cert in /etc/stunnel. Next, I had
to create an /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf that referred to the certificate
I created and specified the Irssi proxy in the stunnel.conf file. An
example follows below (adjust the file paths, &ldquo;accept&rdquo; IP address
and port as necessary):


<pre     class="programlisting">
; stunnel.conf code snippet
; Certificate/key is needed in server mode and optional in client mode
cert = /etc/stunnel/cert.pem
key = /etc/stunnel/key.pem
[linuxjournal]
accept=123.123.123.123:9000
connect=127.0.0.1:9000
</pre>
</p><p>
So, what the previous code snippet does is specify the cert/key file for the
self-signed SSL cert, then binds the SSL side of stunnel to the external
IP address 123.123.123.123 on port 9000, and it'll hand off packets to
my Irssi proxy running in the clear on 127.0.0.1 (localhost) on port
9000. The last adjustment to this setup would be to go to the mobile
device and specify that the IRC connection should be SSL, and now I
have a secure proxy I can attach to with any client of my choice. Now
I can log in to IRC from my regular Irssi client, but then when I'm on
my phone, I can use the friendlier interface that Colloquy provides,
all without having different nicknames on IRC.

Being &ldquo;Pinged&rdquo; and Getting Alerted</h2></div></div><p>
I still have a problem though. I still forget to log in to IRC and check
my private messages&mdash;and some friends stack up many
&ldquo;pings&rdquo; before
they finally give up in frustration. I got to thinking and realized that
since I'm on a mobile phone, it might be possible to send an e-mail to
the SMS gateway my mobile provider runs when I get a PM. That'd give me
a reminder to log in to IRC in the event that I forget. After searching the
Internet for a bit, I discovered some other fellow had much the same
idea. Michael Lustfield explains it on his blog in far more detail than
I can put in this article (there's a link in the Resources section), but
I'll summarize his technique here. He's got two Irssi scripts he uses:
screen-away.pl monitors if there's an active connection to the Irssi
proxy, and awayproxy.pl sends any highlights off to a designated e-mail
address if there isn't an active client connected to the Irssi proxy.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11100f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Getting an SMS on WebOS
</p></div></div><p>
&ldquo;But Bill...e-mail isn't an SMS!&rdquo; You may think that, but just
about every mobile carrier can accept SMS messages for delivery to
a mobile phone via e-mail. In my case, I use AT&amp;T, so any e-mail sent
to &lt;myphonenumber&gt;@txt.att.net will arrive as a text message on my
phone. So, all I have to do is drop Michael's scripts in my Irssi scripts
folder, adjust awayproxy.pl so that the
<tt  >$config{emailto}</tt> variable
is <tt  >mymobilenumber@txt.att.net</tt>, and then activate both scripts from
within Irssi by doing a <tt  >/script load awayproxy.pl</tt>
and <tt  >/script load
screen-away.pl</tt>. Now, any mention of my name in any of the channels I
sit in will cause an SMS to be fired off to my phone, and I can log in
from my phone or tablet and jump into the conversation.

We Can Rebuild It, We Have the Technology...</h2></div></div><p>
This solution, although totally usable, isn't quite as elegant as I'd
like. My &ldquo;main&rdquo; tablet and phone are both iOS devices (iPad
and iPhone, but let's not discuss my choice of mobile devices here), and Apple has a very
clean, integrated push notification system. I started poking around to see
if there was any way to send push messages to my iDevices rather than rely
on SMS&mdash;that way my iPad would receive IRC &ldquo;pings&rdquo; as
well. 
</p><p>
It turns out,
the Internet already had an answer for this problem as well. A fellow
named Chris Jones already put together a patched version of Irssi and an Irssi script that does all the heavy lifting for this solution. His Web
page (see Resources) talks all about the details on this and
how to install it. He even mentions using Irssi with stunnel!

</p></div></div><p>
In closing, utilizing this set of scripts has really brought IRC into
the 21st century for me. I love the idea of IRC, but it shows a lack of
mobility features due to its age. With this set of scripts and the right
mobile tools, you can bring your IRC addiction up to date&mdash;and have
it with you, anywhere you go!
