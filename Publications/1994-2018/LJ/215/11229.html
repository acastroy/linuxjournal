William E. Shotts Jr.'s <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Linux Command Line</em></span> (No Starch)</h2></div></div><p>
Once you've dived into William E. Shotts Jr.'s <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Linux Command
Line: A Complete Introduction</em></span>, you may find your mouse gathering
dust, says the book's publisher No Starch Press. In order to 
appreciate Linux's premier advantages fully&mdash;its power, customizability
and rich UNIX-supercomputer heritage&mdash;every new user should fire up
the Bash shell and explore what's possible with the command line.
Shotts takes readers from first keystrokes to writing full
programs in Bash. Along the way, they will learn the timeless skills
handed down by generations of gray-bearded, mouse-shunning gurus:
file navigation, environment configuration, command chaining, pattern
matching with regular expressions and more. In addition to that
practical knowledge, Shotts reveals the philosophy behind these tools
and the rich heritage that desktop Linux machines have inherited from
their UNIX forebears. Shotts' hope is that his readers eventually
will find that the command line is a natural and expressive way to communicate
with a computer.

Eric Redmond and Jim R. Wilson's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Seven Databases in Seven
Weeks</em></span> (The Pragmatic
Bookshelf)</h2></div></div><p>
Data is getting bigger and more complex by the day, and so are the choices
in handling it. Cutting-edge solutions for managing this complexity
range from traditional RDBMS to newer NoSQL approaches, seven of which
are explored in Eric Redmond and Jim Wilson's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Seven Databases
in Seven Weeks: A Guide to Modern Databases and the NoSQL
Movement</em></span>. The
book is a tour of some of the hottest open-source databases today that
goes beyond basic tutorials to explore the essential concepts at the
core of each technology. With each database&mdash;Redis, Neo4J, Couch, Mongo,
HBase, Riak and Postgres&mdash;readers tackle a real-world data problem that
highlights the concepts and features that make it shine. Readers also
explore the five data models employed by these databases: relational,
key/value, columnar, document and graph to determine which kinds of
problems are best suited to each, and when to use them.

Xi3 Corporation's TAND3M Software</h2></div></div><p>
Go green and save green with Xi3 Corporation's TAND3M Software, an
application that enables two people to share and use one
(Linux or Windows) Xi3 Modular Computer for all computing functions
simultaneously. Xi3's
CEO says that by taking advantage of the underutilized resources of the
Xi3 Modular Computer, the operating system and the other applications,
computing costs are cut in half without a drop-off in performance. Each
Xi3 Modular Computer needs only 20 Watts to operate, and the addition
of TAND3M Software halves the electricity needs to a mere 10 Watts
per seat. Such low power use is due in large part to Xi3's unique
architecture that separates the traditional computer motherboard into
three distinct pieces: one for processor and memory option, a second for
display and power options, and a third for I/O or special connectivity
options. Xi3 says that its patented design and architecture solves
many of the problems blocking the progress of advanced computing.

Wind River Solution Accelerators for Android</h2></div></div><p>
Intel subsidiary Wind River Software wants to help you jumpstart
your Android device development with its new Wind River Solution
Accelerators for Android. The three specialized software
offerings&mdash;one each for user experience, connectivity and
medical-specific devices&mdash;can accelerate Android device development and reduce engineering
time and cost to help developers turn around high-quality devices
faster than ever. Modular in nature, the offerings give developers
flexibility to pick and choose software components to fill in gaps in
expertise and instantly integrate complex, differentiating features. The
user-experience module accelerates boot times and supports features
like multi-windowing screen navigation, multimedia functionalities and
advanced firmware management. The connectivity module supports multimedia
interoperability capabilities via the DLNA standard, SyncML support
and FM radio capabilities. The medical module helps medical device
manufacturers leverage Android's platform richness and flexibility
for innovation.

Apache Hadoop</h2></div></div><p>
Although the organizations that already use Apache Hadoop make up
a Who's Who of the Net, this open-source framework for reliable,
scalable, distributed computing officially has achieved the level of
enterprise-readiness to earn a 1.0 designation. A foundation of cloud
computing and at the epicenter of &ldquo;big data&rdquo; solutions, Apache Hadoop
enables data-intensive distributed applications to work with thousands
of nodes and exabytes of data. The framework enables organizations
to store, process, manage and
analyze the growing volumes of data being created and collected every
day more efficiently and cost-effectively. It can connect thousands of servers to process and analyze data at
supercomputing speed. Version 1.0 reflects six years of development,
production experience, extensive testing and feedback. New features
include support for HBase, strong authentication via Kerberos, Webhdfs,
performance-enhanced access to local files for HBase and other features
and fixes. The Apache Software Foundation directs the development of
Apache Hadoop.

Opera TV Store</h2></div></div><p>
If you thought Opera was just a niche browser company, think
again. The company recently released its newest offering, the Opera TV
Store, a HTML5-based store solution for connected TVs. Opera says that
its goal with the TV Store is &ldquo;to bring apps to the world of TV in a
huge way&rdquo; by providing users with a &ldquo;lean-back Web
experience&rdquo;
and to provide developers, content providers and manufacturers with
&ldquo;convenient, cross-platform technology&rdquo;. The store is optimized for
HD-Ready screens and standard remote controls, so users simply can fire
up the cool apps, including video, games and news. The Opera TV Store can
be installed by OEMs on any set-top box, Blu-ray player or HD-Ready TV,
and manufacturers can harness the power of TV apps on any device running
the Opera Devices SDK. Opera also says that &ldquo;OEMs can rest assured that
their users will get the best possible experience, without having to worry
about the content themselves.&rdquo;

Scribus</h2></div></div><p>
After an intense, four-year-long slog, the developers of Scribus&mdash;the
multiplatform, open-source, professional desktop publishing
application&mdash;have released the new stable version 1.4. The upgrade integrates a
whopping 2,000+ feature requests and bug resolutions. The most notable
new feature is that Scribus 1.4 is now based on Qt4, which developers
say enables it to run equally reliably on all supported platforms. Other
feature highlights include improved object handling, advanced options
for text and typography, undo/redo for nearly all text-related actions,
usability improvements, new features for vector objects, better fill
handling, additional color palettes, a rendering frame, more vector
import filters and much more.
