Data science is big. If you want to learn it, where do you start?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14b8580.0x15b0408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my last few articles, I've written about data science and
machine learning. In case my enthusiasm wasn't obvious from my
writing, let me say it plainly: it has been a long time since I last
encountered a technology that was so poised to revolutionize the world
in which we live.
</p><p>
Think about it: you can download, install and use open-source data science libraries, for free. You can download rich data sets on nearly
every possible topic you can imagine, for free. You can analyze that
data, publish it on a blog, and get reactions from governments and
companies.
</p><p>
I remember learning in high school that the difference between freedom
of speech and freedom of the press is that not everyone has a printing
press. Not only has the internet provided everyone with the
equivalent of a printing press, but it has given us the power to
perform the sort of analysis that until recently was exclusively
available to governments and wealthy corporations.
</p><p>
During the past year, I have increasingly heard that data science is
the sexiest profession of the 21st century and the one that will
be in greatest demand. Needless to say, those two things make for a very
appealing combination! It's no surprise that I've seen a major uptick
in the number of companies inviting me to teach on this subject.
</p><p>
The upshot is that you&mdash;yes, you, dear reader&mdash;should spend time
in the coming months, weeks and years learning whatever you can
about data science. This isn't because you will change jobs and
become a data scientist. Rather, it's because everyone is going to become a data scientist. No matter what work you do, you'll be better at
it, because you will be able to use the tools of data science to analyze
past performance and make predictions based on it.
</p><p>
Back when I started to develop web applications, it was the norm to
have a database team that created the tables and queries. Nowadays,
although there certainly are places that have a full-time database staff, the
assumption is that every developer has at least a passing familiarity
with relationship (or even NoSQL) databases and how to work with
them. In the same way that developers who understand databases are
more powerful than those who don't, people in the computer field who
understand data science are more powerful than those who don't.
</p><p>
There is a bit of bad news on this front, though. If you thought that
the pace of technological change in programming and the web moved at a
breakneck pace, you haven't seen anything yet! The world of data
science&mdash;the tools, the algorithms, the applications&mdash;are moving
at an overwhelming speed. The good news is that everyone is
struggling to keep up, which means if you find yourself
overwhelmed, you're probably in very good company. Just be sure to keep
moving ahead, aiming to increase your understanding of the theory,
algorithms, techniques and software that data scientists use.
</p><p>
Where should you start? In this article, 
I describe some of the resources I've found to be the most helpful
as I've been diving deeper and deeper into data science.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14b8580.0x15b0880"></a>
Statistics</h2></div></div><p>
There's no way around it. If you're going to do data science,
you're going to need to learn some statistics. I took a year of it in
graduate school, and then I did some analysis as part of my dissertation,
but there's a lot I don't know, so I've been trying to improve
my understanding. Every little bit helps! Whether you're simply
learning Bayes' Theorem, figuring out how linear regression works or
learning how to modify your data to minimize errors, statistics is a
crucial part of this.
</p><p>
So, where do you start? There are a number of courses, often for free
or at very low cost, at edX, Udemy and Coursera. A particularly
popular introduction to machine learning, which includes the basic
statistical knowledge you'll need, is taught by Stanford professor
Andrew Ng via Coursera. If you're looking for something more
hard-core, I definitely recommend the Udemy courses by
LazyProgrammer.
</p><p>
Two good and standard textbooks on the subject are <span   class="emphasis"><em>An Introduction to
Statistical Learning</em></span> (by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani) and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Elements of Statistical Learning</em></span> (by Hastie, Tibshirani and
Friedman). Both books are published by Springer, and both are available in PDF
form, as free downloads: <a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461471370" target="_self">www.springer.com/us/book/9781461471370</a> (<span   class="emphasis"><em>An Introduction
to Statistical Learning</em></span>) and <a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn" target="_self">statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn</a> (<span   class="emphasis"><em>Elements of
Statistical Learning</em></span>).
You probably should download and read those books; over
time, the ideas and methods they describe will help you to reason about
what you're doing.
</p><p>
I also want to recommend the various books and courses offered by Jason
Brownlee at his site <a href="http://machinelearningmastery.com" target="_self">machinelearningmastery.com</a>. His writing is clear,
and he tries to be very practical about what he shows you. Especially if you're
using Python for machine learning, his books are a great way to get started and
improve your understanding.
</p><p>
Note that you definitely should not wait until you have read
through books, watched lectures and taken courses to start playing
with machine learning. That would be akin to saying you should
try to learn a language only after you have mastered its grammar. As
with language, you should be trying to use it at the same time that you're
learning how it works.
</p><p>
Along with understanding the math, it's also important to have a good
skeptical, statistical look at the world. Jake VanderPlas has a talk
called &ldquo;Statistics for Hackers&rdquo; that not only translates the
mathematical ideas into code, but it also concentrates on the aspects
that are most likely to be of interest in data science.
</p><p>
Two other books worth mentioning are <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cartoon Guide to
Statistics</em></span>
(by Larry Gotnick and Woollcott Smith) and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Statistics Done
Wrong</em></span> (by
Alex Reinhart). Both books are good for getting you to think in this way&mdash;by
which I mean, when someone presents you with data, or if you are about
to present others with data, you'll at least find some of the holes in
the argument or alternative explanations to yours.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14b8580.0x15b0f08"></a>
Data Science Theory</h2></div></div><p>
Although statistics certainly is an important part of data science, it's
not the only part. Indeed, there are a number of model types that
aren't statistical, such as K Nearest Neighbors.
</p><p>
Knowing the different types of algorithms that are available, when
each is appropriate and how to tweak them will be invaluable. In
many cases, you'll just want to throw a bunch of algorithms at the
problem&mdash;and if your data set is small and/or easy to understand,
that'll be just fine. But if it takes a long time to train your
model, trying a dozen different algorithms is neither smart nor
effective. Just as an expert cook knows which knife to use, and a
good programmer should know which language is appropriate for a given
task, someone building machine learning models should know which
algorithms are more likely to be useful. (It's not always 100%
obvious, but you do want to narrow down your starting set.)
</p><p>
In addition to the books I mentioned above, some others are well worth
reading and reviewing. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Doing Data Science</em></span> by Cathy O'Neil and
Rachel Schutt, as well as the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Python Data Science Handbook</em></span> by Jake
VanderPlas, introduce the ideas behind data science, but they also
include working code and examples that you can and should play with.
</p><p>
A phenomenal resource is the Analysis Vidhya site
(<a href="http://analyticsvidhya.com" target="_self">analyticsvidhya.com</a>) that summarizes, describes and
instructs in a truly staggering number of technologies, algorithms
and theories. Daily email messages from this site always
are interesting and useful&mdash;and, quite frankly, overwhelming in their
number and scope.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14b8580.0x15b1278"></a>
Data Science Hacking</h2></div></div><p>
Although statisticians have been using software for many years, one of
the key differences between statistics and data science is that the
latter requires programming knowledge. It's no surprise, given its
shallow learning curve and huge, friendly community, that Python has
become the leading language for data science. If you choose to use
Python (which I definitely recommend), you'll need to learn a
number of libraries that don't always adhere to the standard Python
way of doing things: NumPy and Pandas provide data structures,
and then there's also scikit-learn, which provides the algorithms and supports
for machine learning.
</p><p>
The websites for each of these packages, but especially scikit-learn,
are huge, and they likely will make you think you never can learn it all. And
indeed, no one is expecting you to know everything that those packages
can do by heart. But over time, you will be expected to understand
more and more algorithms and ideas, and also how to implement them.
</p><p>
If you're using Python, the the Jupyter notebook is likely to be your
day-to-day tool of choice. Jupyter (<a href="http://jupyter.org" target="_self">jupyter.org</a>) continues to
expand in impressive functionality, with new versions released every
few weeks. If you're new to Python or to dynamic languages in general,
Jupyter can feel a bit odd, but it quickly grows on you and
will become a fluid part of your day-to-day work.
</p><p>
As you can see, it's important to practice. I often say that
programming languages are like human (natural) languages, in that you
need to practice using them to gain true fluency. Data science is the
same, but it's also different, in that you need fluency in several
related disciplines in order to succeed.
</p><p>
Fortunately, the world of data science is large and growing, providing
a lot of interesting data sets for people to analyze, both for fun and
practice, and also for serious use. &ldquo;I Quant NY&rdquo;
(<a href="http://iquantny.tumblr.com" target="_self">iquantny.tumblr.com</a>) is a blog that not only provides
interesting information about New York City from city-supplied data
sets, but it also shows how data scientists can ask questions and provide
answers that affect many people. If you're looking for data sets,
it's hard to know just where to start or what sort of analysis
might be most appropriate. The weekly newsletter &ldquo;Data is Plural&rdquo; by
Jeremy Singer-Vine (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural" target="_self">https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural</a>), the
&ldquo;data sets&rdquo; subreddit (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets" target="_self">https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets</a>) and the
new website Data.World (<a href="http://data.world" target="_self">data.world</a>) all offer a staggering
number of data sets on a variety of topics. Choose something that's
of interest to you, and see what questions you can ask and
answer.
</p><p>
I would be remiss if I didn't mention a few of the podcasts to which I
listen. Not only do they provide me with the latest news,
information, anecdotes and updates from the world of data science,
they also allow me to understand the trends better&mdash;for example,
in favor of neural networks and deep learning. &ldquo;Partially Derivative&rdquo;
(<a href="http://partiallyderivative.com" target="_self">partiallyderivative.com</a>) and &ldquo;Linear
Digressions&rdquo;
(<a href="http://lineardigressions.com" target="_self">lineardigressions.com</a>) are my two favorites, but there are
some others, such as &ldquo;Data Science at Home&rdquo;
(<a href="http://worldofpiggy.com/podcast" target="_self">worldofpiggy.com/podcast</a>) and &ldquo;Data Skeptic&rdquo;
(<a href="https://www.dataskeptic.com" target="_self">https://www.dataskeptic.com</a>). Podcasts aren't going to help you to
code better; only more coding can really do that. But they will give
you perspective and understanding that make the code more obvious.
</p><p>
Finally, although I believe that data science is changing our world for
the better, we do need to be on the lookout for potential issues.
Cathy O'Neil's book, &ldquo;Weapons of Math Destruction&rdquo;, is a must-read for
anyone entering this world. Even if you aren't writing algorithms
that will affect millions of people, awareness of our biases as
humans, and of our need to be transparent when implementing
policy via machine, is an important one. This easily is one of the
best books I've read in the last few years.
</p><p>
I'll definitely return to data science topics in the future, 
given its importance to developers. But for my next article, I plan to
return to the world of web applications and databases, looking at the
languages, libraries and packages we use to create modern
applications.
