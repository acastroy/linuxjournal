How do you organize and manage something so hugely successful and widely varied? Not
easy, but Harvard's Cyberlaw Clinic has some good advice.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12c0580.0x13b8300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
As of today (June 1, 2017), we've been talking about open source for exactly 19
years, 3 months and 23 days. The start date was February 8, 1998, when Eric S.
Raymond distributed an open letter by email with the subject line <span   class="emphasis"><em>Goodbye,
&ldquo;free
software&rdquo;; hello, &ldquo;open source&rdquo;</em></span>. What followed was a deliberate (though barely
coordinated) effort by many geeks (including yours truly and this magazine) to make
open source a thing.
</p><p>
It worked. In books alone, the result looked like what's shown in Figure 1. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12189f1.large.jpg"><img src="12189f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Google Books Ngram Viewer: Open Source
</p></div></div><p>
I am sure that the line would have continued rising toward the sky if Google hadn't
tired of scanning books in 2008
(<a href="https://backchannel.com/how-google-book-search-got-lost-c2d2cf77121d" target="_self">https://backchannel.com/how-google-book-search-got-lost-c2d2cf77121d</a>).
</p><p>
Anyway, we succeeded. As both an concept and a practice, open source is embedded in
technology, business, culture, government&mdash;you name it. In fact, it is so widely
uttered, you might even call it mature.
</p><p>
But it's not, because making full sense of open-source development is still an
uphill struggle, especially if you're an organization trying to manage
it&mdash;especially in a world that still doesn't fully understand it, even though it
gets talked about constantly.
</p><p>
This is why it's good to have help such as just came from Organization and Structure
of Open Source Development Initiatives (<a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/30805146" target="_self">https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/30805146</a>),
a new report by Dalia Topelson Ritvo
(<a href="https://tara.law.harvard.edu/cyberlawclinic/bio/dalia-topelson-ritvo" target="_self">https://tara.law.harvard.edu/cyberlawclinic/bio/dalia-topelson-ritvo</a>), Kira
Hessekiel (<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/khessekiel" target="_self">https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/khessekiel</a>) and Christopher T. Bavitz
(<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/cbavitz" target="_self">https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/cbavitz</a>) of the Cyberlaw Clinic

Center for Internet &amp; Society (<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu" target="_self">https://cyber.harvard.edu</a>) and Harvard Law School. (Disclosure: these are all

fellow.)
</p><p>
The angle of the report is organizational, and the organizations it addresses are
less those of the development efforts themselves than of companies that need to get
some kind of handle&mdash;or several handles&mdash;on the simple fact that they already
support open-source work, either by employing developers of open-source code or
because they have a code base they would like to open up and release to the world.
There are as many answers to <span   class="emphasis"><em>What should we do?</em></span> as there are companies and
developers, which also doesn't make things easy. But there are controlling factors
in the real world that can help guide decisions, even as the same factors can be
deeply frustrating.
</p><p>
For example, taxes.
</p><p>
Early on it was easy for an open-source project in the US to obtain 501(c)(3)
status, which relieves an organization of the need to pay taxes. Apache and Mozilla
both got their 501(c)(3) status right out of the gate, without much sweat. Coming
along later, the Open Source Elections Technology Foundation (OSET) had to wait six
years for it, after an initial denial by the Internal Revenue Service. Then
there were the IRS's BOLO&mdash;&ldquo;Be On the Look-Out&rdquo;&mdash;lists. According to the
report, &ldquo;Every released BOLO dated between August 2010 and July 2012 included
open source organizations.&rdquo; Why? Because, said the IRS, &ldquo;[t]he members of these
organizations are usually the for-profit business or for-profit support technicians
of the software. The software is provided for free, however; fees are charged for
technical support by the for-profit.&rdquo; This, says the report, &ldquo;misrepresented the
wide variety of open source business models, ignoring that many open source
organizations do not have affiliations with for-profit businesses.&rdquo;
</p><p>
BOLOs are gone now, but the IRS's sphincter remains no less tight. Concludes the
report:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
While some open source software organizations may continue to obtain
501(c)(3) status, this option may be closed off&mdash;in particular, for organizations
that choose not to or cannot offer activities to educate the public in software
development or a demonstrable connection to a charitable purpose. Given these
changes, open source software organizations can no longer count on obtaining
501(c)(3) status and may want to evaluate the pros and cons of adopting alternative
business structures.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Those include 501(c)(4) and 501(c)(6), which are alternative tax-exempt status
recognitions. The former is for &ldquo;civic leagues or organizations...devoted
exclusively to charitable, educational, or recreational purposes&rdquo;. The latter is for
&ldquo;business leagues&rdquo;. Specifically:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
In the open source software community, 501(c)(6)
organizations generally act as umbrella organizations for many projects rather than
working directly on a single project. For example, the Dojo Foundation and the
Eclipse Foundation are 501(c)(6) organizations that support open source software
projects.25 But, a shift in IRS policy toward open source software organizations
applying for 501(c)(6) status&mdash;which parallels the shift regarding 501(c)(3)
applications&mdash;may be underway.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
That happened, for example, when the IRS turned
down the OpenStack Foundation's application for 501(c)(6) recognition.
</p><p>
Advice: 
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Given the complexities associated with achieving exemptions from federal
income tax, open source software organizations may have to begin reassessing their
business models. Organizations may decide to continue to operate as nonprofits while
paying federal income taxes, generate and rely on profits, or adopt a middle path
between those two extremes.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
There are many choices for middle paths: Limited
Liability, S, C and Benefit Corporations, for example. The report unpacks all of
them.
</p><p>
Then there's the matter of governance. Back in the early days, governance wasn't
much of an issue. It still isn't in cases where leadership is strong and clear, such
as with Linux. But in countless other cases, governance can get complicated and
contentious&mdash;because humans, basically.
</p><p>
Recently, for example, the Drupal Association went through a major crisis when one
of its main contributors was exiled for an unspecified infraction involving sexual
kinks&mdash;or...something. Not clear&mdash;if you want the particulars, links abound on
the web. The two most relevant to the governance issue, however (at least at the
time of this
writing), are &ldquo;Working through the concerns of our community&rdquo; (March 31, 2017,
<a href="https://www.drupal.org/association/blog/working-through-the-concerns-of-our-community" target="_self">https://www.drupal.org/association/blog/working-through-the-concerns-of-our-community</a>)
and &ldquo;Next
steps for evolving Drupal's governance&rdquo; (April 10, 2017,
<a href="http://buytaert.net/next-steps-for-evolving-drupal-governance" target="_self">buytaert.net/next-steps-for-evolving-drupal-governance</a>).
</p><p>
Both Linus Torvalds and Dries Buytaert (of Drupal) are what the report calls
benevolent dictators. But while Linux remains at the bazaar end of the
bazaar-cathedral spectrum of projects, Drupal has some cathedral elements. For
example, Dries also runs Acquia, a for-profit company that deploys Drupal in the
world.
</p><p>
The report also describes other models: meritocracies (Apache for example),
delegated governance (Ubuntu, possibly, with qualifications), dynamic governance (or
sociocracy). There are also models from outside the open-source world&mdash;for example,
federated nonprofits, aka &ldquo;Model E&rdquo;. Examples of that are the Girl Scouts and the
American Red Cross. These are important to recognize and learn from, because they've
been around a long time and have survived troubles that many open-source projects
still haven't encountered. Hence this advice:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
One major challenge for all organizations&mdash;but particularly those focused on
specific skill sets (like institutions engaged in open-source software
development)&mdash;is recognizing the value of outside perspectives and non-technical
skills. Because the heart of every open source project is the development and
maintenance of the project's code, it's not always apparent how
non-technical contributions should be recognized, or how they might improve
development processes or community relations. In the same vein, those who are the
best developers and code contributors may not always possess the soft skills
required for open-source leadership roles.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
As we know.
</p><p>
Bottom lines:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
When open source creators launch new projects, their primary concerns may be
technical. But expanding their focus to the organizational can have enormous
benefits. Projects that make thoughtful decisions around corporate formation may
streamline dealings with the IRS and also create stable entities that will help them
be sustainable and dedicated to their ultimate missions. Projects that spend time
considering questions about corporate formation set themselves up to create a
welcoming project community with engaged and invested contributors; and then govern
that community effectively....
</p><p>
Though it is sometimes overlooked, the history of the open source movement shows us
that the projects that defined their corporate structure and governance practices
early and concretely set themselves up for success. While some elements of the
landscape have changed&mdash;most notably the IRS's attitude toward open source
projects&mdash;the benefits of intentionality remain.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
To me the most important issue is the tax one, because we still haven't made
clear the leverage on both technology and the economy that comes from nonprofit work
on open-source code. If we had made this clear, the IRS's job would be easier today,
and fewer projects seeking nonprofit status would be stuck in limbo.
</p><p>
But maybe that job is an impossible one.
</p><p>
A few years back, a former FCC chairman told me there were two things that federal
lawmakers, almost across the board, didn't understand: &ldquo;One is technology and the
other is economics.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Still, it's worth trying.
</p><p>
Maybe the sell is to ask them if they think technology is a Good Thing. If they say
yes, we can add that open source causes commercial successes, and that it's not the
other way around. In other words, if you want to maximize commercial successes and
technology benefits in the world, go ahead and give nonprofit status to open-source
projects that want it. The good work those projects do will throw off a lot more tax
money as well.
