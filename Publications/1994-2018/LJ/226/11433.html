Although it sometimes might seem as if relational databases have gone
the way of the dinosaur, making way for non-relational (NoSQL)
databases, such as MongoDB and Cassandra, a very large number of
systems still depend on a relational database. And, although there is no
requirement that a relational database use SQL as its query language,
it's a rare database product that does not do so.
</p><p>
The good news is that SQL is relatively easy to work with,
particularly when the queries are straightforward. It's fast and easy
to create tables, insert data into them, update that data and
write queries that retrieve some or all parts of the data. SQL also
makes it fairly easy to combine (&ldquo;join&rdquo;) information from multiple
tables, letting you normalize the data, while keeping speed and
flexibility at a maximum.
</p><p>
SQL might not be difficult to work with on its own, but you rarely
work with it in a vacuum. Usually, your SQL statements reside within a
program you have written. The SQL is kept as a text string within
the application and is then sent, via a network socket, to the
server.
</p><p>
There are several problems with this. First, it means you
have to mix two different languages within the same program. Inside
your Web application, which you've worked hard to write, and which
you try to ensure is maintainable, you have code in a totally separate
language, inside strings, which you cannot test or maintain
directly.
</p><p>
Even if the SQL queries weren't written inside strings, you 
still would be faced with the fact that the majority of your Web application
is written in one language, but your data-manipulation routines are
written in another language. A Web application contains, no matter
how you slice it, components in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as
whatever server-side language you're using. Adding SQL to this can
only complicate things further.
</p><p>
Even if SQL and a typical server-side language were on equal footing
in terms of the syntax of a Web application, there's a fundamental
mismatch between the ways in which they handle data. SQL operates
with rows and columns within tables; everything in a relational
database has to fit into this table-centric view of the world. By
contrast, modern programming languages have a rich variety of data
structures and typically are object-oriented to some degree or
another.
</p><p>
Libraries that bridge the gap between procedural code and SQL are
known as object-relational mappers, or ORMs. ORMs typically
represent database records as instances of a particular class. In
order to represent 50 records, you would need 50 instances of a
class, with the state of each instance reflecting the names, types
and values of the columns in that record.
</p><p>
There are two basic paradigms for passing data between the
object-oriented data structures and the database, both of which were
described by Martin Fowler. In the first paradigm, known as Active
Record, each instance is tied directly to a row in the database, and
the class itself (as well as each object) is responsible for ensuring
that the data is saved to the database. In other words, Active Record
requires that you create a single class, and that it handles both sides
of the object-relational divide. The Active Record class in Ruby on
Rails is (not surprisingly) an implementation of this paradigm and
provides a great deal of power and flexibility.
</p><p>
A second paradigm is known as Data Mapper, and it requires the use of
three different object classes: a class that represents the data
itself at the object level, a class that represents the database
table and a &ldquo;mapper&rdquo; object that acts as a go-between, ensuring that
the object and relational parts of the system are appropriately
synchronized.
</p><p>
An excellent and popular example of the Data Mapper paradigm can be
found in the SQLAlchemy project. SQLAlchemy has been around for a
number of years already, and makes it possible to work with relational
databases flexibly from within your Python program, without having
to write any SQL.
</p><p>
In this article, I 
take a look at SQLAlchemy, exploring a number of its
options and features, and considering how it can be used in Web and
other applications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe11580.0xf098d8"></a>
Connecting to a Database</h2></div></div><p>
Installing SQLAlchemy should be straightforward to anyone who has
installed Python packages before. You can get SQLAlchemy from PyPi,
the Python Package Index, either by downloading it from
<a href="http://pypi.python.org" target="_self">pypi.python.org</a> or by using the easy_install or pip programs to
retrieve and install it. I was able to install it with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pip install sqlalchemy
</pre>
</p><p>
You might need to install SQLAlchemy as root. Or, you can install
it into a virtual machine, using the popular virtualenv package for
Python, which gives you nonroot control and permissions over a Python
environment.
</p><p>
You also will need to install a driver for the database you intend to
use. My favorite relational database is PostgreSQL, and I use the psycopg Python
driver, also available on PyPi and (by
extension) via pip.
</p><p>
I should note that although I know SQLAlchemy works with Python 3,
much of the work I do nowadays is still in Python 2, mostly
because that's what my clients are using. My examples, thus, also
will be in Python 2, although I believe they will work in Python 3
with little or no change.
</p><p>
Let's assume you have a database table, People:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE People (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
                     first_name TEXT,
                     last_name TEXT,
                     email TEXT,
                     birthday DATE);
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's also add some initial records:


<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO People (first_name, last_name, email, birthday)
    VALUES ('Reuven', 'Lerner', 'reuven@lerner.co.il', '1970-jul-14'),
           ('Foo', 'Bar', 'foobar@example.com', '1970-jan-1');
</pre>
</p><p>
In order to access this table using SQLAlchemy's ORM, you first need to
create a database session object, which itself must be created using
an &ldquo;engine&rdquo;. Each database driver has its own style of URL. In the
case of PostgreSQL accessed via the psycopg2 driver, you would use
something like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
dburl = 'postgresql+psycopg2://reuven:reuven@localhost/atf'
</pre>
</p><p>
This URL indicates not only the database and driver type, but also my
user name and password (&ldquo;reuven&rdquo; in both cases), the hostname
(localhost) and the name of the database I'll be accessing
(&ldquo;atf&rdquo;).
If the database is not available at the default PostgreSQL port of
5432, you can specify that as well in the URL.
</p><p>
You then tell Python to create a new engine based on this URL:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine(dburl)
</pre>
</p><p>
Now that you have the engine defined, you can create a session based
on this engine. Doing so requires two steps: first you create a new,
custom Session class for this engine, and then you create an instance
of the Session class that you will use to access the database:


<pre     class="programlisting">
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker # import sessionmaker class
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)     # make custom session type
session = Session()                     # make instance of session
</pre>
</p><p>
You're now connected to the database! But, that's not quite enough. If
you want to map your database table to one or more Python objects, you
need to define a class. You do this by defining a normal Python class,
with a few subtle changes:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The class must inherit from Base, a class returned from the
declarative_base function provided by SQLAlchemy.
</p></li><li><p>
The database columns must be defined as class attributes, as
instances of the SQLAlchemy-provided Column class.
</p></li><li><p>

You connect the class with your database table by defining the
<tt  >__tablename__</tt> class-level attribute.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
For example, the following Python class provides a mapping to the
People database table:


<pre     class="programlisting">
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, DateTime
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
Base = declarative_base()
class Person(Base):

    __tablename__ = 'people'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    first_name = Column(String)
    last_name = Column(String)
    email = Column(String)
    birthday = Column(DateTime)

    def __init__(self, firstname, lastname, email, birthday):
        self.first_name = firstname
        self.last_name = lastname
        self.email = email
</pre>
</p><p>
It might not be obvious at first glance, but this class implements the
Data Mapper design pattern. The class attributes that you have defined
describe the columns in the database table and can contain a great
deal of detail, including indexes, uniqueness requirements and even
custom integrity constraints, such as those provided by
PostgreSQL.
The class itself is a standard Python class.
</p><p>

But behind the scenes, because this class inherits from Base, you get a
number of other attributes, including <tt  >__mapper__</tt>, which indicates how
your Python class will be mapped to the database table. You can see
this in an interactive Python shell by asking to see the printed
representation of <tt  >Person.__mapper__</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">

Person.__mapper__
&lt;Mapper at 0x10af5ef90; Person&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
You now have a session that connects to the database and a table in
the database that has been described in Python. You now can execute a
query against your table:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for p in session.query(Person):
    print p.first_name
</pre>
</p><p>
That gives the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Reuven
Foo
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, <tt  >session.query</tt> is executing a query against the
database, without you having to specify the SQL. You also can restrict
the records you'll get, by chaining the
<tt  >filter_by</tt> method to your
query:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for p in session.query(Person).filter_by(id=1):
    print p.first_name
</pre>
</p><p>
That gives the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Reuven
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that the <tt  >filter_by</tt> method is not acting on the results of
<tt  >session.query</tt>. Rather, it is changing the SQL that
eventually is sent
to the database. You can see this by assigning printing to the query
object without executing it or putting it in an iteration context:

<pre     class="programlisting">
print session.query(Person).filter_by(id=1)

SELECT people.id AS people_id,
       people.first_name AS people_first_name,
       people.last_name AS people_last_name,
       people.email AS people_email,
       people.birthday AS people_birthday
FROM people
WHERE people.id = :id_1
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can see from this query that SQLAlchemy binds parameters to
variables inside your query, rather than directly placing your
values. Not only does this allow you to re-run queries later with
different variable values, but it reduces the possibility that you will
suffer from an SQL injection attack, which still is surprisingly
common.
</p><p>
You also can order the results:


<pre     class="programlisting">
for person in session.query(Person).order_by('first_name'):
    print person.first_name

Foo
Reuven
</pre>
</p><p>
And, you also can do all of the basic &ldquo;CRUD&rdquo; activities that
you would
expect. For example, you can create a new instance of your Person class
and then save it to the database:


<pre     class="programlisting">
p = Person('newfirst', 'newlast', 'new@example.com', '1-jan-2012');
session.add(p)
session.commit()
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice how I can handle multiple inserts (or other actions) inside 
a single transaction by only issuing
<tt  >session.commit()</tt> after adding
several objects. Similarly, I can update the object and the
corresponding row in the database:

<pre     class="programlisting">
p.first_name = '!!!'
session.add(p)
session.commit()
</pre>
</p><p>
I also can delete the object:

<pre     class="programlisting">
session.delete(p)
session.commit()
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe11580.0x13033e8"></a>
Relationships</h2></div></div><p>
If SQLAlchemy could only do this, it still would be a nice
library, simplifying your queries. But the real power of SQLAlchemy
occurs when you define relationships between tables. For example,
let's assume that I have an Appointments table, indicating when I'm
meeting with various people:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE Appointments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  person_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES People,
  meeting_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  notes TEXT
);
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's also add some appointments:


<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO Appointments (person_id, meeting_at, notes)
    VALUES (2, '1-jan-2013', 'New Year meeting'),
           (2, '1-feb-2013', 'Monthly update');
</pre>
</p><p>
Now I need to create a Python class that represents appointments:


<pre     class="programlisting">
class Appointment(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'appointments'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    person_id = Column(Integer)
    meeting_at = Column(DateTime)
    notes = Column(String)
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, this class will work just fine. However, there's no
relationship, according to Python, between the Person class and the
Appointment class. To make this work, you'll need to change each of
these table definitions. In the case of Appointment, you'll need to
indicate that the person_id column doesn't just contain an integer,
but that it is a foreign key that points to the &ldquo;id&rdquo; column on the
People table:

<pre     class="programlisting">
person_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('people.id'))
</pre>
</p><p>
On the Person table, you'll need to add a line to the class attributes,
after describing all of the columns:


<pre     class="programlisting">
appointments = relationship("Appointment", backref="person")
</pre>
</p><p>
Thanks to these two lines, you get an &ldquo;appointments&rdquo; attribute
on your
Person model. But thanks to the &ldquo;backref&rdquo; parameter, you also get a
&ldquo;person&rdquo; reference on the appointment. This means you can do
something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for a in session.query(Appointment):
    print a.person

for p in session.query(Person):
    print p.appointments
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that the assumption is that you'll have multiple appointments per
person, representing a one-to-many relationship.
</p><p>
Let's say, however, that you want to have a many-to-many relationship
between people and appointments, such that you can meet with more than
one person at a time, and you can have more than one appointment with a
particular person. In order to do that, you need to modify your
database table and code somewhat, adding a third (association) table.
SQLAlchemy makes it easy to do that. Although I don't have space to show
it here, the basic idea is that you create the third table, and you
use the <tt  >relationship()</tt> function to indicate that there is a secondary
relationship between the class and the join table.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe11580.0x1303c80"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
SQLAlchemy is packed with features. In addition to the introductory
examples I showed here, it handles everything from
joins to connection pooling, to dynamically calculated column values,
to creating Python classes based on an existing database table.
There is no doubt that it's a powerful system, one that I expect to
use in some of the Python projects on which I work.
</p><p>
That said, I found SQLAlchemy to be a bit overwhelming for the
newcomer. Perhaps it's because I have long used the Active Record
model in Ruby, which has minimal configuration and syntax, but I
found the syntax for SQLAlchemy to be a bit overly verbose. Then
again, Python has long preferred things be explicit, and there's
no doubt that SQLAlchemy provides a clear and explicit ORM, without much
magic and with obvious ramifications for every function call and parameter.
</p><p>
The other thing that might throw off newcomers to SQLAlchemy is that
the documentation is complete, but not particularly friendly. Once
you start to use the system, I expect that you (like me) will be able
to understand the documentation and make good use of it. But I found
that even the tutorial documents were a bit formal, trying to tell you
too much before moving ahead with actual code. Hopefully, this
article can help some more people become interested in SQLAlchemy.
</p><p>
In conclusion, SQLAlchemy is a great Python module, one that deserves
its sterling reputation and broad popularity. If you're interested in
working with databases from Python programs, you 
definitely should take a look at SQLAlchemy.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe11580.0x1303e90"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Resources</b></p><p>
The home page for SQLAlchemy is <a href="http://sqlalchemy.org" target="_self">sqlalchemy.org</a>, and the
documentation is at <a href="http://docs.sqlalchemy.org" target="_self">docs.sqlalchemy.org</a>. The Python language
is at <a href="http://python.org" target="_self">python.org</a>. I suggest that you read through the
introductory section and then the ORM documentation, rather than look
at the document sequentially.
</p><p>
There are a number of on-line tutorials for SQLAlchemy. Two that I
enjoyed, which are freely available to the public, are
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=399c-ycBvo4" target="_self">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=399c-ycBvo4</a> and 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKAdehPHOMo" target="_self">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKAdehPHOMo</a>.
</p><p>
Finally, Rick Copeland's book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Essential SQLAlchemy</em></span>, published by
O'Reilly in 2008, is a good introduction, particularly if you look at
the ORM section. The rest is a bit dry and technical, even if the
examples are well written. This book is not completely up to date,
and there are several items in it that reflect the fact that it was
published several years ago. Nevertheless, having an additional
reference can be quite handy and can provide examples for certain
features that aren't otherwise obvious.
