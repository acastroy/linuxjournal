AdaCore and Altran Praxis' SPARK Pro</h2></div></div><p>
SPARK Pro is a product jointly developed by Altran Praxis and AdaCore that
provides the language, toolset and design discipline for engineering
high-assurance software. The developers say that the new version 11 of SPARK
Pro offers many enhancements related to the way that functions and proof
functions are handled. These changes are said to improve project efficiency by
eliminating the vast majority of rules that previously were encoded manually.
The main changes include a more powerful language for specifying proof
functions and the ability to use the functions in any proof context. This
greatly simplifies the task of writing and maintaining functional contracts
for critical software, providing high assurance at lower cost. SPARK Pro
combines Altran Praxis' SPARK language and verification tools with AdaCore's
GNAT Programming Studio and GNATbench Integrated Development Environments.
There are SPARK versions based on Ada 83, Ada 95 and Ada 2005, so all
standard Ada compilers and tools work out of the box with SPARK, say the
companies.

Wolfram Research Mathematica</h2></div></div><p>
Wolfram Research calls its Mathematica application, recently upgraded to
version 9, &ldquo;the  broadest, deepest computation system in the
world&rdquo;.
Mathematica 9 adds more than 400 functions in new and expanding application areas
and also introduces the Wolfram Predictive Interface. The latter, intended to
help users fully utilize Mathematica's vast scope and depth, is a suite of
features that intelligently suggests what to try next based on sophisticated
heuristics and data from millions of queries from the Wolfram|Alpha site.
Other new features include highly integrated units support; major new data
science, probability and statistics functionality; full R integration into
the Mathematica workflow; 3-D volumetric image processing and others. Supported
platforms include Linux x86, Windows and Mac OS X.

Opengear's ACM5504-5-G-W-I Gateway</h2></div></div><p>
Improving the management of critical infrastructure in remote locations is
what the new Opengear ACM5504-5-G-W-I Remote Infrastructure Management (RIM)
Gateway is all about. A new member of Opengear's ACM5500 product family, this
sibling offers IT managers a wide range of connectivity options with its new
integrated wireless access point (Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n) to complement the
cellular, wired and wireless access already present in other gateways. Besides
enabling direct management of Wi-Fi-enabled devices, the solution provides the
option of convenient wireless access to the management network using mobile
devices, such as tablets and smartphones. All RIM gateways in the ACM5500
product family provide serial console-port connectivity, environmental
monitoring, power management and monitoring and remote site storage of off-line
logs and running configuration files.

Jon William Toigo's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Office Automation 2.0</em></span> (Apress)</h2></div></div><p>
Those in our midst who look after enterprise-wide IT planning should sneak a
peek into Jon William Toigo's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Office Automation
2.0</em></span>. The Apress title
is an essential guide to office automation in the post-PC era and helps
businesses assess such technologies as virtual desktop infrastructure,
mobile clients and cloud services in terms of their practical applications to
streamlining workload. Toigo emphasizes that rollouts of the latest
enterprise-class technologies cannot produce business value unless management
ensures that the front office is trained to use them correctly, and that
end-user practices and IT processes are dynamically and efficiently coupled in
the organizational culture. Toigo also provides practical guidance for
innovative managers who are seeking to make every automation investment dollar
count toward the three key metrics of business value: cost-containment, risk
reduction and improved productivity.

Philatron Wire and Cable's Flexy CordT</h2></div></div><p>
Traditional extension cords can waste you a lot of time, either by having to
unwind and rewind them repeatedly, or worse, when you struggle trying to
untangle a mess of wire. The answer to this struggle, says Philatron Wire and
Cable, is not in the numerous cord reeling and wrapping devices on the market,
but rather in the company's new Flexy CordT, which it bills as the &ldquo;21st
Century extension cord&rdquo;. Flexy CordT line of extension cords are designed
with a reduced cord and increased coil diameters, which gives them suppleness
properties similar to the Slinky toys. In addition, Flexy Cords are developed
with specially engineered materials with &ldquo;memory&rdquo; (so they
&ldquo;remember&rdquo; their
original retracted length) and are tangle-proof and kink-proof. Flexy Cords
are available in different compact lengths: 4 inches (extending to 8 feet), 5
inches (extending to 10 feet), 10 inches (extending to 20 feet) and 20 inches
(extending to 45 feet).

MetaCase's MetaEdit+</h2></div></div><p>
The new v5.0 release of MetaEdit+ from MetaCase's adds a wide range of 
features to the company's flagship software development tool. MetaEdit+ is
aimed at expert developers who seek to create graphical domain-specific
languages and code generators rapidly. MataCase states that the rich graphical
notations go beyond plain icons and links; they can change on the fly
depending on model data, be nested to unlimited depth, retrieved from
libraries and have a fixed or dynamically varying number of ports to which to connect. These new features allow domain-specific models to mimic closely the
problem domains they describe. The new version integrates into programming
tools like Visual Studio and Eclipse. Software developers get one-click access
from their IDE to MetaEdit+ models, can integrate generated code with
hand-written code and libraries, and automate their build process. Versions
for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X are available.

TeamViewer</h2></div></div><p>
TeamViewer is a popular remote control and on-line meetings application for
Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. The most notable feature in the new version 8 is
the TeamViewer Management Console, a cloud-based administration tool that
offers a wide range of capabilities that addresses the needs of corporate
environments, with emphasis on accountability, stricter security guidelines
and the need for central control of user accounts. Other major new
capabilities of TeamViewer 8 include connection reporting of all sessions and
browser-based single-click connections. New features that reflect the latest
demands of telecommuters include session handover, remote printing, deeper
Microsoft Outlook integration, transmission of remote sound and video and
enhanced session recordings.
