was written by Mark F. Komarinski and Cary Collett. The authors
claim to have nearly two decades of experience between them in
system administration, most in Linux, though some in other UNIX
systems. Reading the cover, I attempted to gain some insight into
what lay in the pages ahead. The cover did promise much in the line
of system administration tasks, security, hardware configuration,
and much more. The book also included the gratuitous CD-ROM. (What
Linux book doesn't these days?) The cover, however, gave no
indication of the kind of audience it was aimed at, so I began
reading, not exactly sure what to expect. The primary task I took
on myself, then, for this review was to determine what audience the
authors were aiming for.
</p><p>The first few chapters cover boot-up and shut-down and a
review of System V start-up, then dive into user administration and
user shells. These chapters do not discuss Linux installation per
se, but I am very familiar with Caldera's OpenLinux Lite, the
distribution included with the book, and it really doesn't require
much in the way of installation instructions, at least not for
anyone vaguely familiar with Linux installation. Besides, all of
Caldera's pertinent documentation is included in the
Appendices.</p><p>As I continued reading I was impressed with some of the
jewels of wisdom and little-known (or not well-documented) facts
about Linux that only seasoned administrators would know.
Unfortunately, this was often offset by short, terse explanations,
short chapters and one- or two-sentence summaries for those basic
chapters toward the front of the book.</p><p>Going a little further and getting into the coverage of
nitty-gritty network administration, the chapters grow longer. Like
an administrator who's finally been given his favorite project to
work on, the chapters suddenly take on more detail and more life.
The authors go into great detail explaining some of the
lesser-understood and lesser-used of the well-known services, the
kinds of problems you can expect, and how to configure,
troubleshoot and maintain them. In fact, most of the chapters where
they went into this kind of detail are quite well-done. Much of the
information presented showed the authors do indeed know a good deal
about those programs and services to which they have had personal
exposure.</p><p>Continuing on, they discuss some of the important issues for
decision makers wanting to know about applications for Linux. Here,
they took on the daunting task of trying to do justice to all the
applications beginning to show up for Linux, from open-source
software to commercial native Linux applications to those which can
be adapted to Linux. They did a creditable job and warned the
reader they would discuss only those programs with which they had
some familiarity. However, I was still surprised they didn't do a
bit more homework for the reader, including a few more applications
which they don't use, but are available.</p><p>For example, in the section on databases, they mention that
Oracle, while not supported on Linux, can use the SCO binaries with
iBCS. While they don't mention it, the same is also true of
Informix. Native Linux applications such as Adabas and YARD (both
from Germany) were not mentioned. I find this even more curious
since Adabas is sold by Caldera, and YARD rivals Informix in its
ability to do nested outer joins and other complex SQL queries.
YARD is also ANSI SQL 92 and SQL3 compliant, something most
open-source Linux databases can't begin to boast about. The authors
talk about distributions later on and mention WGS, which positions
the Flagship database as its premier Linux product, but this isn't
mentioned in the database section.</p><p>While I was hoping that this would be a good book to help
beginners discover Linux, mostly due to the exceptionally
easy-to-install OpenLinux distribution, it is hardly that. Some
omissions and skimpy coverage of basics would lead me to conclude
that this is not a good book for a novice administrator. For
example, in the rather short chapter on &ldquo;Common Features&rdquo;, where
the authors discuss setting environment variables under the bash
shell, they don't mention the
<span   class="bold"><b>export</b></span> command, its usage or
implications. This kind of oversight could have novices wondering
why subshells or programs invoked by the shell haven't inherited a
particular environment variable.</p><p>On the other hand, I also can't recommend this book to
experienced system administrators on the strengths of its detail in
the lesser of the well-known services, even though these sections
are well done. While the book would make an excellent addition to a
library lacking the details of network news (NNTP) or other
services, it isn't justified because of the light or non-existent
treatment given to other areas.</p><p>I can, however, recommend it to managers who may have noticed
their system administrators have begun to use Linux on their
network or are contemplating allowing this to occur. The book does
a good job of introducing Linux in a way that would give managers a
good feeling about this oft-called &ldquo;Renegade OS&rdquo; being put to
work in their companies.</p><p>On a scale of one to five, I would have to rate this book a
solid three. Its apparent lack of focus, its terse coverage of some
important areas, and redundant coverage of some network issues
among the Networking and the Internet Connectivity chapters make me
conclude this first edition doesn't deserve a higher rating.</p><p>For those who think I may be a little harsh, my initial
impression was much lower. While I may be tolerant of a few
clich&eacute;s or awkwardly worded phrases, the authors trounced
solidly on a pet peeve of mine throughout the first few chapters by
misusing the phrase &ldquo;try and&rdquo; when they really wanted you to
&ldquo;try to&rdquo; do something.</p><p>However, I hope the authors will soon begin work on the
second edition, because I can see the framework for a good Linux
system administration handbook. Some other things I hope the
authors will consider is either changing the distribution to Red
Hat, which is what they talk about in many examples, or changing
their examples and discussions in the book to reflect the
distribution. For those who don't know, Caldera OpenLinux, while
using the RPM system, is not a Red Hat distribution, but is based
on the German LST distribution. I would also like to see more
discussion of the File Hierarchy System (FHS), partitioning schemes
and disk recovery with emphasis on
<span   class="bold"><b>fsck</b></span>, and other pertinent
commands. Hopefully, they'll also close some of the really gaping
holes, like forgetting to even mention one of the major Linux
distributions, Debian, not to mention all the foreign
distributions, such as S.u.S.E.</p><p>Overall recommendation for this book: look twice before you
buy. Managers who don't actually administer systems, but make
decisions regarding whether Linux is &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;, or
intermediate users who can use the better-fleshed-out chapters to
complement other manuals they have, could find the book a good
value. Otherwise, I'd hold out to see if the next edition is a more
solid investment.</p></div></div>
