    How SMB-encrypted passwords actually work,
    and a walk-through of the steps required to enable encrypted
    passwords in Samba.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x183e580.0x19363f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>By default, Samba uses plaintext
passwords to authenticate clients who access network resources.
Samba also supports the use of LanManager- and NT-encrypted
password authentication. Using encrypted passwords with Samba has
its advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, encrypted
passwords mean that plaintext passwords cannot be &ldquo;sniffed&rdquo; off
the network when users log in to a Samba share. This is
particularly important when users connect to a Samba server across
a public wide-area network, like the Internet. Furthermore, the
latest service packs for Windows 95 and Windows NT do not allow
plaintext authentication to be used when connecting to an SMB
server. When using the latest version of Windows, either Samba must
be configured to use encrypted passwords, or the registry must be
edited to enable plaintext passwords.
</p><p>On the negative side, using encrypted passwords requires some
extra administrative work. The SMB-encrypted-password algorithm is
incompatible with the standard UNIX encryption method. As a result,
a second password file containing the LanManager- and NT-password
hashes for each user, must be created. If someone makes use of
other services on the server, a technique to keep both password
files synchronized will have to be used.</p><p>As of Samba version 1.9.18, the best reason to not use
encrypted-password authentication has been eliminated. Previous
versions of Samba made use of a Data Encryption Standard (DES)
library to compute LanManager password hashes. Because it was
linked against a DES library, a compiled version of Samba would be
illegal to export from the United States. Strong encryption, like
DES, is still considered a munition by U.S. law. To make it easier
for stateside mirrors of the Samba FTP archive to distribute Samba,
precompiled Samba binaries usually did not contain support for
encrypted passwords. Beginning with version 1.9.18, Samba uses a
crippled version of DES that is still suitable for calculating
LanManager hashes, but is legal to export from the United
States.</p><p>Since the latest service packs to Windows NT and Windows 95
disable the ability to connect to shares, setting Samba to process
encrypted passwords has become even more desirable. While it is
possible to edit the registries on all of your machines to
re-enable the use of plaintext passwords, it is probably easier to
configure Samba to use encrypted passwords.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x183e580.0x1936608"></a>SMB Password Hashes</h2></div></div><p>There are two styles of SMB-encrypted-password
authentication: LanManager and Windows NT. Both techniques use a
file which contains hashed values of a user's password, not
plaintext passwords, just as the standard UNIX authentication
method does. However, each uses its own technique to generate this
hash.</p><p>LanManager-style hashes are generated using this
algorithm:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Convert the password entered by a user to all
capitals.</p></li><li><p>Either truncate the resulting password to 14
characters if it is longer, or pad the password with null bytes if
it is shorter than 14 characters.</p></li><li><p>Use this 14-byte value as two 56-bit DES keys to
encrypt a secret 8-byte value twice, creating a 16-byte value. This
value is the hashed password which is stored in the password file.
This secret value is a string consisting of the characters
<b  >KGS!@#$%</b>.</p></li></ol></div><p>Unfortunately, this algorithm has a serious weakness. First,
the password is converted to all uppercase before it is hashed.
This reduces the number of possible characters in the password from
95 to 69. However, since most punctuation characters are also
denied, the number of possible characters is closer to 40. This
reduces the actual size of the keyspace from 9514 to about 4014.
Further, each half of the password is encrypted independently. This
means that either half of the password can be recovered without
recovering the other half. A better approach would have been to
&ldquo;chain&rdquo; the two encryptions together by feeding the output of the
first encryption into the second encryption. This technique is
called cipher block chaining. The entire 16-byte hashed password
has a possible keyspace of 2128, or 3.4 x 1038. Not using cipher
block chaining reduces the number of possible hashed passwords from
this value to 2(407) or 3.2 x 1011.
</p><p>As a result, it is possible to use brute force to crack the
LanManager passwords in a reasonably short period of time.
L0phtcrack, from L0pht Heavy Industries (http://www.l0pht.com/),
has been demonstrated to exhaust the keyspace in 62 hours on a quad
Pentium Pro 200 SMP box. Since even paranoid users rarely change
their passwords more frequently than every few weeks, systems are
vulnerable to system crackers with more conventional hardware at
their disposal.</p><p>In contrast, the Windows NT hashing algorithm is much
stronger. The NT hashing algorithm consists of computing a 128-bit
MD4 hash of a Unicode version of the user's password. Since the
password is not truncated and makes the entire Unicode character
set available for use, this technique makes use of the entire
128-bit keyspace. Unfortunately, for the sake of backwards
compatibility, nearly all SMB servers allow access using either
hashing technique. This means that an SMB server, like Samba, must
store both hashes in its password database. As a result, at least
for the immediate future, it doesn't matter that the NT algorithm
is stronger.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x183e580.0x1936b30"></a>The Process of SMB-Encrypted
Authentication</h2></div></div><p>The process of SMB-encrypted authentication is the same
whether LanManager or NT encryption is being used. When a client
indicates that it can support encrypted-password authentication
during the protocol negotiation stage, the server will respond with
a random 8-byte value known as the challenge. The challenge is
different for each client request. The server stores the challenge
until the client is authenticated or denied access.</p><p>After the client obtains the password from the user, it
computes the hash value using one of the previously defined
algorithms. The resulting 16-byte value is appended with 5 null
bytes. This 21-byte value is used as three 56-bit DES keys to
encrypt the 8-byte challenge value three times. The resulting
24-byte value is known as the response.</p><p>The server also executes the same algorithm, using the stored
hashed password. If the value the server computes matches the value
returned by the client, the client had to have known the password
or at least the 16-byte hash value generated from the password. As
a result, access will be granted as an authenticated user.
Otherwise, access is denied. In either case, a plaintext password
was not passed over the network, where it could be sniffed by an
eavesdropper.</p><p>However, there is a snag with using this technique. Unlike
the UNIX password hash, the SMB password hash is a password
equivalent. This means that even though it isn't plaintext, it
might as well be. It is the responsibility of the authentication
client to accept a plaintext password and generate a hash before
using it to encrypt the challenge from the server. Unfortunately, a
custom client can be written that, rather than generating the
password hash from a plaintext password, simply accepts a password
hash and uses it to generate the appropriate response to the
server. <span   class="bold"><b>smbclient</b></span>, a component of
the Samba suite, can be modified to accomplish this task. To sum
up, even though it is possible to crack the LanManager password in
a reasonably short period of time, it isn't actually necessary to
gain access to a share if you already know the password hash. The
bottom line is that the Samba-encrypted-password file and the NT
Security Accounts Manager (SAM) both contain sensitive information.
Don't let the fact that it is &ldquo;encrypted&rdquo; lead you to believe
that you don't have to protect it from snoopers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x183e580.0x1936d98"></a>Using Encrypted Passwords in Samba</h2></div></div><p>Configuring Samba to use encrypted passwords is easy&mdash;just
include this setting in the global section of your configuration
file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
encrypt passwords = yes
</pre><p>Encrypted passwords work with all three security levels:
share, user and server. Setting the security option to
<b  >user</b> or <b  >share</b> requires that
the Samba-encrypted-password file exist. If security is set to
<b  >server</b>, no further configuration is necessary,
since all authentication requests will be passed off to a different
SMB server. The server security option provides an easy way to
integrate a Samba server into an existing NT domain. However, most
installations of Samba will use user- or share-level security. The
most common configuration is this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
security = user
encrypt passwords = yes
</pre>


Both the share and the user modes require the smbpasswd file, which
contains the LanManager and NT password hashes for each user who
will be accessing the Samba server.
</p><p>The Samba-encrypted-password file, smbpasswd, is stored by
default in /usr/local/samba/private. This directory is normally
owned by root, with its permissions set to 500, so that only root
can look at its contents. However, this configuration isn't
strictly required&mdash;your smbpasswd file can be stored any place you
wish. The Samba Red Hat package stores the smbpasswd file in the
sensible location of /etc/smbpasswd. Wherever the smbpasswd file is
stored, its permissions should be set to 600 (only user read and
write) and it must be owned by root. It must not be possible for
any user other than root to read this file.</p><p>Users can be added to the smbpasswd file in several ways. The
best way is to use the <b  >smbpasswd -add</b> command.
For example,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
smbpasswd -add jdblair foobar
</pre><p>will add an entry for <b  >jdblair</b> with a
password of <b  >foobar</b>. When adding a user while the
Samba server is running, this command must be used to ensure that
the smbpasswd file is properly locked before it is modified.
</p><p>Another way to create a new smbpasswd file is to use the
mksmbpasswd.sh script that comes with Samba. This script is, oddly
enough, stored in the /source subdirectory of the Samba
distribution. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat /etc/passwd | mksmbpasswd.sh &gt; \
        /usr/local/samba/private/smbpasswd
</pre><p>If the system uses NIS, you should use this command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ypcat passwd | mksmbpasswd.sh &gt; \
        /usr/local/samba/private/smbpasswd
</pre>


After using the mksmbpasswd.sh script, edit the file by hand to
remove root, bin and daemon just to be on the safe side.
</p><p>Finally, to allow users to update their encrypted password,
set the permissions on smbpasswd to be setuid root as
follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chmod u+s /usr/local/samba/bin/smbpasswd
</pre><p>The last problem to note is keeping the smbpasswd file
synchronized with the default UNIX authentication method. If users
access the UNIX machine only through the Samba server, this won't
be a problem. However, most systems also allow users to access
shell accounts, pop servers or other services that will
authenticate using the default UNIX password file. Many techniques
can help keep these two files in sync. A hacked version of the
<span   class="bold"><b>passwd</b></span> command is available that
will update both files at the same time. Many people use
<span   class="bold"><b>expect</b></span> scripts to update a user's
password, entering both the passwd and the smbpasswd command after
prompting the user for a new password. Reportedly, a PAM module to
handle updating almost transparently is in the works and may be
available by the time this article is printed. Asking on the Samba
mailing list (samba@samba.anu.edu.au) for solutions other people
have cooked up to alleviate this problem can be a big timesaver.

with SMB-encrypted passwords, it is still a good idea to make use
of them. Even a slightly half-baked encrypted-password algorithm is
superior to transmitting plaintext passwords across a network.
Keeping the smbpasswd file secure and making sure users don't
choose easily-guessed passwords will help minimize the
risks.</p></div></div>
