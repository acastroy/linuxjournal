courses&mdash;different levels of calculus and differential equations. I
actually enjoyed both, finding them a constant challenge to master.
At that time, I was also working on mastering another exciting
puzzle&mdash;Linux. Back then, there weren't a lot of commercial
applications or even books on Linux. I had just spent a whole night
downloading and copying to floppies, and migrated from Sunsite to
ordering the InfoMagic set and printing out all the FAQs and HOWTOs
I possibly could. I also had to maintain a MS Windows/DOS partition
to run my math software, which was then Maple V. I wasn't happy to
have to reboot to use the software, but when projects requiring
Maple were due, I had to do it.
</p><p>Today, many commercial products are available for Linux. One
of them is Mathematica, a full-featured, powerful, math lover's
paradise. I would have loved to have had it three years ago.</p><p>Recently, I had the privilege of reviewing this product and
will look at as many features as possible in such a brief
forum.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x141c580.0x1514d98"></a>What is Mathematica?</h2></div></div><p>Wolfram states, &ldquo;Mathematica is the world's only fully
integrated environment for technical computing.&rdquo; Instead of having
various packages or tools for a variety of mathematical functions,
Wolfram has integrated them all into one package. For this review,
I tested the mathematical capabilities and ease of use of this
integrated package, using the many math examples given in the huge
book by Stephen Wolfram that is included with the package.</p><p>There is no limit to the things one can do with Mathematica;
each would take an entire book in itself to review. I will stick to
simple uses here, and keep the beginner in mind.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x141c580.0x1514ef8"></a>Package Contents</h2></div></div><p>Mathematica comes in a big box that includes the
following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The Mathematica Book</em></span> by
Stephen Wolfram, which is 1403 pages of excellent examples,
applications and colorful illustrations of Mathematica in
action.</p></li><li><p>Getting Started Guide</p></li><li><p>Standard Add-On Packages Book</p></li><li><p>Mathematica System Administrators Guide</p></li><li><p>License Certificate</p></li><li><p>Installation media on CD</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x141c580.0x15154d0"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>The installation of Mathematica was quite smooth. The
installer is a simple shell script that asks various questions,
such as directory and program password. The password can be
obtained at Wolfram's web site upon product registration and is
required in order to have a fully functioning program. Other
options for registering are via fax or mail. The registration links
the copy of Mathematica to the host name on which you are
installing. Once the installation is performed and the password
obtained and included in the installation step that asks for it,
you can begin using Mathematica. It is possible to install the
password at a later time, but you will be able to run in MathReader
Mode only.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x141c580.0x15155d8"></a>Usage</h2></div></div><p>There are two ways to run Mathematica: via X, using the
notebook and palette window (see Figure 1) or via the command line.
The benefits of using the notebook and palette are the
point-and-click interaction and the ability to save each session as
a worksheet.</p><p><a href="2213f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Palette</b></span></a></p><p>The benefit of the command line is quick computations. Note
that graphics are a separate process. If you are running from the
command line in an xterm, any graphics you generate will go to
Mathematica's graphics output window. If you are running from a
virtual terminal, the graphics will be plain ASCII.</p><p>The language to interact with Mathematica is quite simple and
intuitive and also well-documented. If you have any rudimentary
programming experience, it will be even easier to use. When using
the worksheet window, it checks syntax and gives a system bell if
you use the wrong type of bracket.</p><p>The first two examples of this are plotting (sin 1/x2)(e-x)
(Figure 2) and power series (Figure 3):</p><p><a href="2213f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2. (sin
1/x2)(e-x)</b></span></a></p><p><a href="2213f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3. Power
Series</b></span></a></p><p>I was running the equations in Figures 2 and 3 on a 486/100,
and all of the computations ran quite fast.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x141c580.0x1515b58"></a>More Advanced Computations</h2></div></div><p>One of the major parts of one math course I took was power
series. One such equation done with Mathematica is shown in Figures
4 through 6.</p><p><a href="2213f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4.
Differential Equations</b></span></a></p><p><a href="2213f5.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 5.
Integration</b></span></a></p><p><a href="2213f6.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 6.
Graphical</b></span></a></p><p>This is just the tip of the iceberg in regard to the many
mathematical equations you can perform with Mathematica. You can
also program Button Boxes to perform specific actions when you
click on them. This option enables you to create interactive
worksheets (see Figure 7). Other capabilities include sound,
animation and transforming input files (such as an image file) or
external sounds. Mathematica's language can be used to read in
files, output to files, read directory contents (explicitly and
type-globbing), change to a different working directory and delete
files, all of which I found to be quite useful. Any programmer will
appreciate the Mathematica feature that converts a Mathematica
expression to a C or FORTRAN expression&mdash;an extremely useful
feature (Figure 8).</p><p><a href="2213f7.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 7.

Mathematica worksheets to HTML or TeX.</p><p>I tested the HTML conversion, and it basically produced an
HTML document with links to images containing all of the worksheet
contents, both text and graphics (see
<a href="2213l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>). Output from
Mathematica can be sent to an external file, or one file can be
combined (spliced) with another. External commands can be launched
from Mathematica, e.g., to start Netscape or any one of the various
word processing packages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x141c580.0x150cc28"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Mathematica is an excellent tool with limitless features. I
was impressed at how smoothly it ran with both Netscape and
StarOffice running at the same time. I truly wish this had been
available when I was in school, not only because it is available
for Linux, but because of all the useful features and the fun I
have using it. I like the flexible language Mathematica uses, and
the documentation is excellent. I found <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Mathematica
Book</em></span> to be full of great examples and explanations on
usage. Best of all, it runs on Linux and takes full advantage of
Linux's speed, both in computations and graphics rendering.</p><p>Users of this product could be engineers, scientists,
chemists, teachers, students and general math enthusiasts. I highly
recommend Mathematica to anyone who is involved in the sciences.
This is one tool you will always find invaluable, and it is well
worth the price.</p></div></div>
