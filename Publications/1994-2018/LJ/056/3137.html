    This month, Mr. Lerner returns to the subject of Embperl,
    showing us
    how it can be used to edit database records.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb30580.0xc28500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Those who have read more than a few of my
&ldquo;At the Forge&rdquo; columns know that I am a great fan of HTML/Perl
templates, which allow us to mix the two in a single document. In
October, I introduced Embperl, a templating system that can
function as a stand-alone CGI program, but can also be integrated
into the mod_perl module for Apache. This month we will take a
closer look at Embperl, exploring ways in which it can allow us to
edit records in a database.
</p><p>There are a number of good reasons to use templates. First of
all, by putting code and design in the same document, designers and
programmers can each modify the elements for which they are
responsible. No longer is the programmer the bottleneck when a site
decides to change its design, as is the case when dynamic output is
produced by CGI programs.</p><p>Even when you are unlikely to change the look of a
dynamically generated HTML page, Embperl (and similar in-line
templating mechanisms that allow you to mix code and HTML) enables
you to stick it all together, making the logic easier to follow. I
have written many CGI programs in which the dynamic output was
dwarfed by the static output&mdash;but because even one portion of the
resulting HTML page had to change over time, the entire thing had
to be within the province of the program.</p><p>Since the time I wrote October's introduction to Embperl, the
package has been improved significantly. Perhaps the most
significant change is that recent releases of Apache 1.3.1 and
mod_perl 1.15 free you from having to recompile everything when
installing a new version of Embperl. Now, Embperl can be installed
and upgraded separately from Apache and mod_perl, just as you
install and upgrade other Perl packages from CPAN. Please see the
&ldquo;Resources&rdquo; sidebar to learn where to obtain the latest
information, including installation instructions, on Apache,
mod_perl and Embperl.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb30580.0xc28710"></a>Why Databases?</h2></div></div><p>Databases are an increasingly important part of the Web.
Using them, we can create customized and personalized sites,
bringing people the specific information they want, rather than
simply handing them all the information we have.</p><p>In addition, databases are designed to store and retrieve
information easily. If text files and DBM files are too insecure or
unstructured for your needs, consider using a relational database.
Relational databases store their information in tables, where each
table has columns (describing the various fields) and rows (with
one record stored per row). Using multiple tables is where the
&ldquo;relational&rdquo; part comes in, and it can be an extremely powerful
tool. You could probably program this functionality on your own,
but doing so would be quite complicated&mdash;and besides, someone has
already done the work for you.</p><p>Relational databases are manipulated using SQL, the
Structured Query Language developed by IBM in the 1970s. You don't
write programs in SQL; instead, you write &ldquo;queries&rdquo; that
manipulate one or more tables. Using SQL, you can create tables,
modify their contents and request combinations of columns and rows
containing particular types and pieces of data.</p><p>SQL is not a programming language, so it must be created and
submitted to a database server by a programming language. In the
past, each database product required its own version of Perl in
order to allow access; this led to versions known as Oraperl,
Sybperl, et al. Recently, the generic DBI (database interface) has
produced a stable and portable database engine that allows access
to any relational database with the same interface. The
database-specific parts are kept in DBDs (database drivers) loaded
dynamically by DBI. Assuming you stick to standard SQL rather than
database vendors' proprietary extensions, you should be able to
switch database brands by modifying a single Perl statement.</p><p>The relational database I use in these examples is MySQL,
described by its author as a &ldquo;mostly free&rdquo; database. I have been
using MySQL for quite some time now, and while it does not have all
the optimization and locking features of its larger competitors, it
performs admirably&mdash;and more features are on the way. For more
information on MySQL, see the &ldquo;Resources&rdquo; sidebar.</p><p>Once you have installed Embperl, you need to tell Apache
which documents should be interpreted with Embperl rather than as a
straight HTML document. On my computer (running a modified version
of Red Hat Linux 5.1), I put the following in the srm.conf
configuration file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Alias /embperl/ /usr/local/apache/share/embperl/
</pre><p>In addition, I put the following in the access.conf
configuration file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /embperl&gt;
SetHandler perl-script
PerlHandler HTML::Embperl
Options ExecCGI
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>


In other words, I told Apache that any URL beginning with /embperl
refers to files actually in /usr/local/apache/share/embperl, and
that any files in /embperl should be interpreted by the
HTML::Embperl content handler. After restarting Apache, Embperl was
up and ready to run.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb30580.0xc28ad8"></a>Creating our Table</h2></div></div><p>This month, we will create a database consisting of a single
table, a list of clients for a consulting practice. One of the
central tables in this system is the Clients table, which contains
basic information about each client.</p><p>Here is the SQL necessary to create this table:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE Clients (
        id MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL
           AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
        address1 VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
        address2 VARCHAR(40) NULL,
        city VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
        state VARCHAR(40) NULL,
        country VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
        zip VARCHAR(40) NULL,
        contact_name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
        contact_phone1 VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
        contact_phone2 VARCHAR(40) NULL,
        contact_fax VARCHAR(40) NULL,
        initial_contact_date DATE NULL,
        dollars_per_hour TINYINT NOT NULL,
        UNIQUE (name)
 );
</pre><p>Again, we cannot enter this SQL directly into a relational
database server; we must use a program that has been compiled with
the correct client libraries. MySQL comes with a program
(<span   class="bold"><b>mysql</b></span>) that allows interactive
communication with the database; alternatively, we can use DBI to
send the above SQL.
</p><p>Each column in Clients is defined as a VARCHAR, that is, a
variable-length text field. The length of the field is determined
by the number in parentheses, which I set to 40 mostly to make
other elements of the programming easier. (Over time, I expect to
make most of these fields quite a bit shorter.)</p><p>The <b  >id</b> field is special, not only because
we define it as an unsigned integer (giving us the option of
including up to 16 million different clients), but because it is
set to be the &ldquo;primary key&rdquo;. As far as the database is concerned,
each row can be identified uniquely with the primary key alone. We
set <b  >id</b> to <b  >AUTO_INCREMENT</b>,
meaning that MySQL will give the first client an ID of 1 in the
archive file, the second an ID of 2 and so forth. Each client will
receive an automatically generated, unique ID number.</p><p>We also declare the <b  >name</b> column to be
unique, since having more than one client with a given name could
be confusing for the people involved. The database would accept
several identically named columns, as long as the ID numbers were
different. However, we will avoid the possibility of having two
clients named &ldquo;IBM&rdquo; by checking for this in the database.</p><p>You may wonder why we didn't use <b  >name</b> as
the primary key, since it is guaranteed to be unique. We could have
done so, and everything would work fine (perhaps a bit slower,
since text strings are larger than integers). But consider what
will happen if a client changes its name&mdash;we would have to update
all of the references to that client, since old ones will no longer
point to the right place. By making our primary key independent of
any information the client changes, we can continue to keep track
of the client regardless of what information changes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb30580.0xc29058"></a>Inserting Records into the Table</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have defined our table, we will create an Embperl
document that will let us insert new records. (Right now, our table
is empty.) An Embperl document is largely the same as an HTML
document, so you can use the <b  >&lt;H1&gt;</b>,
<b  >&lt;P&gt;</b> and <b  >&lt;Blink&gt;</b>
tags as well as regular text, and it will work just fine.</p><p>However, you can insert Perl code within the Embperl document
by putting it within special square brackets. Here are the four
types of square brackets that Embperl understands:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >[- CODE -]</b>: Evaluate
CODE.</p></li><li><p><b  >[+ CODE +]</b>: Evaluate CODE,
inserting the final value into the HTML document.</p></li><li><p><b  >[! CODE !]</b>: Evaluate CODE as
<b  >[- CODE -]</b>, but only once.</p></li><li><p><b  >[$ Meta-code $]</b>: Evaluate
Embperl meta-commands.</p></li></ul></div><p>Thus, we can include this statement:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[- $foo = 5; -]
</pre>


and <b  >$foo</b> will be set to 5&mdash;a value that persists
over multiple invocations, since mod_perl and Embperl cache such
values. If instead we include:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[+ $foo = 5; +]
</pre>


then a &ldquo;5&rdquo; will appear in the document where the brackets were.
If you are unfamiliar with the idea of a &ldquo;final value from an
expression&rdquo;, you might want to end every Embperl block with the
name of a variable. Variables return their values, so if you type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[+ @reverse_list = reverse @list; $foo +]
</pre>


then a &ldquo;5&rdquo; will be inserted into the HTML document at that point.
</p><p><a href="3137l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>, add-client.html,
is a simple Embperl document that adds a client to the database. It
does not check the data we hand it&mdash;since MySQL will do much of
that for us&mdash;although it will show the user any database errors
that might occur.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb30580.0xc299f8"></a>Creating the Form</h2></div></div><p>If you are new to templates, it might take a while to
understand the idea of a single file containing both an HTML form
and the program necessary to process it. Consider that this is no
different from a CGI program producing the form from which it can
get input.</p><p>Listing 1 contains two parts: form processing and form
creation. While Embperl looks at the former before the latter, we
will look at creation first, since it is generally easier to
handle, especially when working with templates for the first
time.</p><p>We will have one HTML form element for every column in our
table except for <b  >id</b>, since MySQL generates the
ID for us automatically. Later, we'll expand this program to handle
editing and deleting of rows in our table, which means we will need
to handle one form element for each column and row in our database,
in addition to one for the &ldquo;new&rdquo; record we will be
submitting.</p><p>My solution is to give each form element the name of the
column to which it is attached, followed by a hyphen and the ID
number. The &ldquo;city&rdquo; column for the row with id = 5 will be an
element named &ldquo;city-5&rdquo;, and the name of the client with id = 30
will be an element named &ldquo;name-30&rdquo;. Since MySQL starts
auto-incrementing ID with 1, we can use &ldquo;name-0&rdquo;, &ldquo;address-0&rdquo;
and so forth for our new entry.</p><p>Early on in our program, we will define the
<b  >@colnames</b> array, which will contain the names of
the columns in our database:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
@colnames = (id name address1 address2 city
        state country zip
         contact_name contact_phone1 contact_phone2
        contact_fax
         initial_contact_date dollars_per_hour);
</pre><p>Now that we have defined <b  >@colnames</b>, we can
create the HTML form with Embperl's meta-commands. We want to
create an entry for each element (except for <b  >id</b>,
since modifying that would create serious problems), so we will
iterate through each element of <b  >@colnames</b>,
adding the necessary HTML and remembering to skip
<b  >id</b>. This part of my implementation looks like
this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[$ foreach $column @colnames $]
[$ if $column ne "id" $]
&lt;TR&gt; &lt;TD&gt;
        [+ $column +]
 &lt;/TD&gt; &lt;TD&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" name="[+ $column +]-0"
         size="40" maxlength="40" &gt;
 &lt;/TD&gt; &lt;/TR&gt;
 [$ endif $]
 [$ endforeach $]
</pre>


The above code looks a lot like Perl, with good reason. It uses a
<b  >foreach</b> loop, which iterates over the elements
of an array (<b  >@colnames</b>), putting each successive
element of the array in a scalar (<b  >$column</b>). We
can then use that scalar value by putting it in square-plus
brackets at the appropriate points in our HTML.
</p><p>You are probably not used to seeing the
<span   class="bold"><b>endif</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>endforeach</b></span> meta-commands in the
square-dollar brackets. These tell Embperl where the
<span   class="bold"><b>if</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>foreach</b></span> meta-commands end their
scope, just as closing curly braces would do in a standard Perl
program.</p><p>We set the maximum length of each field to &ldquo;40&rdquo;, just as
the fields in our table are all defined to be
<b  >VARCHAR(40)</b>. If we were to modify the table
definition such that each column were set to a more reasonable size
(e.g., <b  >name</b> should probably be closer to 60, and
<b  >contact_phone</b> closer to 15), we would also want
to modify the size of each field in the HTML form. Otherwise, users
will blindly enter too many characters, and their input will be
silently truncated by the database server. The MySQL DBD
(<b  >DBD::mysql</b>) has a <b  >length</b>
attribute that can be used for such purposes, if you wish.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb30580.0x1022698"></a>Processing the Form</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have created the form, let's think about how we
can process it once we receive it. The Embperl document will
receive the form's name-value pairs exactly as if they were being
submitted to a CGI program, although we will have to extract them
somewhat differently. The pairs are sent in the
<b  >%fdat</b> hash, in which the hash's keys are names
of the submitted HTML form elements, and the hash's values are
those values. We can grab the name of the new client with
<b  >$fdat{"name-0"}</b>, the main telephone number with
<b  >$fdat{"contact_phone1-0"}</b> and so forth.</p><p>Inserting a record into a table follows the pattern:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT (column1, column2, column3) "
 VALUES ("value1", "value2", "value3")
</pre><p>We will want to do something like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT (@columns)
 VALUES (%fdat)
</pre>


Of course, life isn't quite that easy; we must first create a new
array, <b  >@insert_colnames</b>, with the names of the
columns we wish to insert&mdash;in other words, everything except
<b  >id</b>:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[- @insert_colnames = grep !/^id$/, @colnames; -]
</pre>


Then we turn that into a comma-separated list, which is what we
will need for the first part of the INSERT:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[- $insert_colnames = join ', ', @insert_colnames; -]
</pre>


With that accomplished, we will use Perl's built-in
<span   class="bold"><b>map</b></span> function to turn
<b  >@insert_colnames</b> from an array of column names
into an array of column values. We then convert the resulting array
into a scalar, in which each value is separated by a comma and
surrounded by double quotation marks:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[- $values = join '", "', map {$fdat{$_ .
"-0"}}
        @insert_colnames -]
</pre>


If <b  >@insert_colnames</b> were to consist of
<pre     class="programlisting">
(column1, column2, column3)
</pre>


the above use of map would turn it into:
<pre     class="programlisting">
($fdat{"column1-0"}, $fdat{"column2-0"},
$fdat{"column3-0"})
</pre>


which <b  >join</b> would then turn into:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$fdat{"column1-0"}",
"$fdat{"column2-0"}",
"$fdat{"column3-0"})
</pre>


There aren't any quotes at the beginning or the end, but we can add
them when we finally construct the query:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[+ $sql = "INSERT INTO Clients ($insert_colnames)
        VALUES (\"$values\")"; +]
</pre>


We use square-plus brackets here in order to see (and debug, if
necessary) the query we send to the database. Don't forget that if
we are using double quotes to take advantage of variable
interpolation, we must escape the double quotes we wish to send in
our query with backslashes.
</p><p>We finally send that query with the statements:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[- $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare($sql); -]
[- $sth-&gt;execute; -]
</pre><p>If there are any errors, print them for the user:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;[+ $sth-&gt;errstr +]&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
</pre>


Our new record is now inserted in the database.
</p><p>This entire form-processing section is unnecessary if the
user has not submitted any form elements. In Listing 1, you can see
how we used the Embperl <span   class="bold"><b>if</b></span>
meta-command to exclude evaluation of this entire block of code if
the user has already done something.</p><p>The first time you run this, don't be surprised if everything
seems to work <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> you get your original form
back. As they say, that's not a bug&mdash;it's a feature! If Embperl
finds fields in an HTML form that match the name-value pairs in
<b  >%fdat</b>, it fills them in automatically. You can
turn this option off by modifying the
<b  >EMBPERL_OPTIONS</b> bitmask field, described in the
Embperl documentation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb30580.0x10231f0"></a>Creating an All-Purpose Editor</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have seen how to enter new records using Embperl,
let's expand the template such that it will allow us to modify and
delete existing records, as well as add new ones. You can see the
complete listing for such a template in
<a href="3137l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a> in the archive file,
client-editor.html.</p><p>The first task is to retrieve existing elements from the
database and turn them into a list of form elements the user can
grab. As we saw earlier, it will be easiest if we give each form
element the name of the column with which it is associated, along
with a number indicating its record ID number.</p><p>The first order of business is to retrieve rows from the
current database. We do that with a SELECT statement, whose syntax
looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT column1, column2, column3 FROM Tablename;
</pre><p>We set up our query as follows:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[- $sql = "SELECT $colnames FROM Clients"; -]
</pre>


Now we prepare and execute the query using the standard DBI syntax:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[- $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare ($sql) -]
[- $sth-&gt;execute -]
</pre>


The result from a SELECT is a table, which we can retrieve in a
number of different ways. Perhaps the easiest method is to grab it
as an array reference, then turn that array reference into an array
containing the name-value pairs, continuing to fetch array
references until we run out. If we use Embperl's
<span   class="bold"><b>while</b></span> meta-command, we can do that
fairly easily:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[$ while ($record = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_arrayref) $]
</pre>


We then grab the <b  >id</b> column:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[- $recordid = $record-&gt;[0]; -]
</pre>


We can turn that array reference into an array, using Embperl's
<span   class="bold"><b>foreach</b></span> meta-command to iterate
over each element, printing each one except <b  >id</b>
in a table row. If we store the current record (row) number in
<b  >$recordid</b> and the current field number in
<b  >$fieldcounter</b>, we can create this by iterating
over the following code:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;[+ $colnames[$fieldcounter] +]&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
 &lt;input type="text"
 name="[+ $colnames[$fieldcounter] .
        '-' . $recordid +]" size="50"
maxlength="100"
        value="[+ $field +]" &gt;
&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
</pre>


We will also add a set of three radio buttons to indicate whether
the user wishes to delete this record, modify it or do nothing. We
will set &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; as the default, since we don't want users to
inadvertently delete any elements. We create the radio buttons,
using the <b  >modify-</b> stem just as we would in
normal HTML. However, we will add the current ID number to that
stem:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;P&gt;&lt;input type="radio" value="nothing"
 name="modify-[+$recordid +]" checked&gt; Do nothing
 &lt;input type="radio" value="modify"
 name="modify-[+$recordid +]"&gt; Modify this client
 &lt;input type="radio" value="delete"
 name="modify-[+$recordid +]"&gt; Delete this client &lt;/P&gt;
</pre>


As you can see in Listing 2, we also added a check box to the
initial &ldquo;new client&rdquo; form to indicate whether a user is
interested in adding a new client. This check box can be hardcoded
in HTML, since we are allowing users to add new elements from only
that one form, with the pseudo-ID of 0:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;P&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox"
name="modify-0"&gt;
 Add this new client &lt;P&gt;
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb30580.0x1023980"></a>Inserting, Updating and Deleting</h2></div></div><p>Just as add-client.html (Listing 1) was divided into a
processing section (the first part) and the form-generation section
(the second part), so too is our full client-editor.html (Listing
2). The above section describes how we will use SELECT to create
the HTML form, so all that remains is describing the processing
section, which comes at the top of the template.</p><p>With add-client.html, we could assume that the user wanted to
add a new client. There are now four possibilities: adding a new
client, updating an existing client, deleting an existing client
and doing nothing at all. While
<span   class="bold"><b>add</b></span> can be true only for
<span   class="bold"><b>modify-0</b></span> (the new record), we have
to check every set of HTML form elements that comes to us. The
simplest case, of course, is when the <b  >modify-</b>
radio button is set to &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;.</p><p>If the user wants to add a new record, the element
<b  >modify-0</b> will be checked. We can use an Embperl
<span   class="bold"><b>if</b></span> meta-command to check for its
existence:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[$ if $fdat{"modify-0"} ne "" $]
</pre><p>In other words, if the user checked
<b  >modify-0</b>, we will add a new record, just as we
did in add-client.html.
</p><p>Finding out if the user checked <b  >modify</b> for
one of the records is a bit trickier. We take the names of all
submitted form elements <b  >(sort keys %fdat)</b>, and
use <span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span> to grab all of those with
the <b  >modify-</b> stem:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[$ foreach $clientid
 (grep {($_ =~ /^modify-\d+$/) &amp;&amp; ($fdat{$_} eq
        "modify@bb:1.      )}
 (sort keys %fdat)) $]
</pre><p>If the above looks a bit intimidating, remember that
<b  >$_</b> contains the value of the scalar currently
being handled by grep. We tell grep to return only those array
elements that match <b  >modify-\d+</b> (that is,
<b  >modify-</b> followed by one or more digits), and
whose value is <b  >modify</b>. We then take the array
returned by grep and iterate over it using Embperl's
<span   class="bold"><b>foreach</b></span> meta-command.
</p><p>Once inside the foreach loop, how do we create the SQL query?
We first have to grab the ID of the element in question, so that we
will update only the appropriate record. We do that by
giving:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$clientid =~ m/(\d+)$/;
</pre><p>This puts the ID value in the temporary variable $1. We then
use a combination of grep, map and join to create the list of
name-value pairs necessary to complete an UPDATE statement syntax
with:
<pre     class="programlisting">
UPDATE Clients SET
name1="value1",name2="value2"
 WHERE id = $1
</pre>


We use grep to grab all column names except for
<b  >id</b> (once again, we don't want to change that
value). We then filter that result through map, turning the list of
column names into a list of <b  >name="value"</b> pairs.
Finally, we join that list together with commas, resulting in the
scalar <b  >$pairs</b>:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$pairs = join ', ',
 map {"$_ = '" . $fdat{$_ . "-$1"} . "'"}
 grep (!/^id$/, @colnames);
</pre>


We can then set up the SQL query as follows:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$sql = "UPDATE Clients SET $pairs WHERE id = $1";
</pre>


Deleting elements is easier than updating, since we don't need the
name-value pairs. We can use the statement:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$sql = "DELETE FROM Clients WHERE id = $1";
</pre>


where <b  >$1</b> matched the number of the current
element.

needs some help with its user interface, since it is still possible
for someone to enter an illegal value (e.g., a bad
<b  >DATE</b> element for
<b  >initial_contact_date</b>, or a fraction for the
<b  >TINYINT</b> column
<b  >dollars_per_hour</b>). If you have more than three
or four clients, this interface quickly becomes tedious. The lack
of truly descriptive names for each column gives a hard-to-use look
to a program that is far easier and less error-prone than entering
straight SQL would be.</p><p>However, improving the interface is fairly straightforward
once you understand how to perform the four basic database
operations: <b  >INSERT</b>, <b  >SELECT</b>,
<b  >UPDATE</b> and <b  >DELETE</b>. Indeed, we
have seen that doing all of these in Embperl can be quite simple.
Creating alternative interfaces should not be hard to do, given the
examples we have already seen.</p><p>More importantly, this Embperl template is useful for much
more than just the Clients table. By modifying the value of
@columns and the name of the table, you could use this same
template to modify nearly any record in any table.</p><p>I hope you have enjoyed this romp through the world of
Embperl and templates. A number of templating systems are now
available for doing similar things; even if you are unaccustomed to
using such templates to communicate with databases, you should
consider getting one of the available packages and trying it. Their
power may convince you of their utility, too.</p><p><a href="3137s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
