    This article explains the concept of CIDR and shows you how
    you can implement it on your network.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e88580.0x1f803f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>CIDR, Classless Inter-Domain Routing,
allows you to maximize use of the limited address space under the
current implementation of the Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4).
After reading this article, even if you have never configured a
computer for network communications before, you should have a good
understanding of these references to networking.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e88580.0x1f80500"></a>Background</h2></div></div><p>CIDR is the current trend in routing and has been for over
three years. This concept was introduced in 1993 to alleviate the
shortage of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses until the next
generation (IP version 6&mdash;IPv6, aka IPng for IP next generation)
arrives.</p><p>Currently in testing, IPng will significantly expand the IP
address space by several orders of magnitude. IPng will also come
with its own security enhancements. Those desiring to participate
in the future today may have the opportunity to do so, since Linux
has kernel-level support for IPng. Until IPng is deployed on a wide
scale, making the best use of what we have is what CIDR is all
about.</p><p>To help you understand why we need CIDR at all, let's journey
back in time to the beginning of this decade. IPv4, the protocol
used by computers to find each other on a network, was in use then,
but there really weren't many connections to the Internet or
machines needing Internet connections. In fact, a good number of
systems still relied on uucp, the UNIX to UNIX copy protocol, where
machines &ldquo;called&rdquo; each other at predetermined times and exchanged
e-mail traffic. At that time, the IP-address pool seemed unlimited.
That was also about the time Mosaic, the first web browser,
appeared.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e88580.0x1f806b8"></a>IP Basics</h2></div></div><p>Those who consider themselves well-versed in &ldquo;classful&rdquo;
routing may wish to skip ahead to the next section. Computers
understand base 2 numbers (ones and zeroes), and humans understand
base 10 (0-9), so engineers worked out a compromise to give
computers numbers while keeping it simple for use by humans. All
computers on the Internet have a unique IP address which can be
represented by a string of ones and zeroes. If that string is
divided up into four sets of eight (octets), you get four numbers
with a range from 0 (eight zeroes) to 255 (eight ones), which are
arranged in the form XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX. This arrangement is called
&ldquo;dotted decimal notation&rdquo; and makes understanding the
significance of each unique IP address a little easier for us
humans. These addresses were then further broken down into
arbitrary &ldquo;classes&rdquo; A-D. Looking at the first half of the first
octet:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Class A = 0-127 (0000)
Class B = 128-191 (1000)
Class C = 192-223 (1100)
Class D = the rest (1110)
</pre><p>The positions beginning from the left represent 128, 64, 32
and 16&mdash;see <a href="3017t1.html" target="_self">Table 1</a>. Furthermore,
Class A uses only the first number as the network number, e.g.,
10.XXX.XXX.XXX; Class B uses the first two numbers as the network
number, e.g., 172.32.XXX.XXX; Class C uses three numbers as the
network number, e.g., 192.168.1.XXX; Class D is reserved for
testing purposes. A network address can be thought of as having a
network and host portions represented by numbers and XXXs
respectively. For a Class C address, the network portion consists
of the first three octets with the host portion as the final
octet.</p><p>The following concepts with respect to networking computers
must be understood. Note that the &ldquo;definitions&rdquo; I provide here
are given to aid in understanding basic concepts for use in this
article, and are not the actual definitions of the terms.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>host address</b></span>: A
unique address assigned to a communications device in a computer.
If a computer has multiple communications devices (e.g., Ethernet
cards or modems), each of these devices will have its own unique
address. This means that a host (computer or router) can be
multi-homed, i.e., have multiple IP addresses. This can also be
artificially created by assigning different IP addresses to the
same device (called IP aliasing).</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>network address</b></span>:
The base (lower) address assigned to a network segment, depending
on its netmask. This is the first host IP number on a subnet. For
example, on the Class C network that extends from 192.168.1.0 to
192.168.1.255, the network address would be 192.168.1.0.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>broadcast address</b></span>:
The upper address assigned to a network segment. In the example
above, this address would be 192.168.1.255.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>netmask</b></span>: A mask
consisting of that portion of the IP address where all greater bits
consist of ones (in base 2) and all lower bits consist of
zeroes&mdash;in other words, ones represent the network portion of the
address, and zeroes represent the host portion. For the example
above, this mask would be 255.255.255.0.</p></li></ul></div><p>With this introduction to IP addressing, and remembering that
a decade ago almost no PCs participated in networking, it is easy
to see why during the 1980s IPv4 seemed to have an endless supply
of addresses, even though not all addresses could be assigned.
Theoretically, if you could make use of all the usable IP addresses
available, you'd have a maximum of approximately 500 million
addresses, but even 100 million is extremely optimistic and
insufficient for today.
</p><p>Before leaving this section, I'd like to describe an
experiment. This experiment will not work properly if performed in
an environment with machines using only the Microsoft Windows IP
stack, since its implementation is broken, or at least doesn't
follow the rules everyone else plays by. Therefore, you will need
to be on a UNIX or Linux machine with other UNIX or Linux boxes on
your network. Type the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ping -c 1
</pre><p>What you will see in response is every UNIX box answering
back with its IP address, and each reply following the first one
will have (DUP!) next to it, indicating it is a duplicate reply.
The <b  >-c 1</b> argument tells
<span   class="bold"><b>ping</b></span> to send only one ping packet.
The number of replies received will depend on how many (non-MS)
machines you have on the network. If this is performed from an MS
Windows machine (95 or NT), you will receive a reply from the local
machine only.
</p><p>What is the point of this little demonstration? If you change
the netmask on a machine, say from 255.255.255.0 to 255.255.0.0
thereby changing its network and broadcast addresses, even though
nothing else changed (i.e., it still has the same IP address and is
still connected to the network the same way) it will cease talking
to its neighbors. In other words, this machine is now on another
network and will require a gateway to talk to the other machines on
the local net (all bets are off for the Microsoft machines).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e88580.0x1f81000"></a>CIDR</h2></div></div><p>While IP classifications A-D are still in use in the
networking world, those terms are obsolete. For the sake of
clarity, I will continue to use them to explain how CIDR works and
how you can implement it. Along with CIDR comes the concept of
variable length subnet masking (VLSM).</p><p>Basically, with a &ldquo;Class&rdquo; address, you have a default
subnet mask. For a Class C address, this default subnet is 24 bytes
long, so putting all ones in the first 24 bytes and zeroes in the
rest, we have 255.255.255.0. For class A and B, this would be
255.0.0.0 and 255.255.0.0, respectively. This basically gives
anyone assigned a full Class C address 256 unique addresses, of
which two are reserved, one each for network and broadcast
addresses. Under &ldquo;classful&rdquo; addressing, we are limited to
providing full Class A, B or C addresses to those requiring IP
addresses. With &ldquo;classless&rdquo; addressing, we can subnet these
addresses quite simply. As stated above, the network portion of the
address is equivalent to that portion of the IP address
corresponding in base 2 to all ones, and the host address to all
zeroes. This means that a Class C address looks like:</p><p><b  >11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 =
255.255.255.0</b> (<b  >128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1</b> in
the first three positions and 0 in the last). Again, note that this
is 24 ones and 8 zeroes, for a total of 32 positions.</p><p>Let's say we have one Class C address (192.168.1.0) available
for use, but we have two offices with approximately 75 hosts at
each location, one in New York and one in New Jersey. While we
could simply use the Class A address at each site with each office
using unique numbers, we can't connect them together because
machines in New Jersey can't find those in New York and vice versa.
The reason these two portions of the network can't find each other
is because in order for a computer to find another on a network, it
assumes an address on its local network (the host portion where all
the numbers are zeroes) is directly connected to it, and one on
another network is reachable only by going through a
gateway.</p><p>A gateway is a machine (computer or router) that has two or
more network addresses, at least one on the local network and one
or more on other networks. A gateway sends any communications not
on the local network via one of its other communications devices,
depending on the information stored in its routing table. Under
classful routing, we would need two half-used Class C addresses for
each office, which would be very wasteful of scarce IP
addresses.</p><p>With CIDR, we can cut the Class C address into two different
networks. To do this, we will extend our netmask by one more bit,
giving us two separate networks, where before we just had one. This
will change our netmask from 255.255.255.0 or 24 ones (hereinafter
referred to as /24) to a /25 network, or 255.255.255.128. Both of
our new networks will have this same netmask; all other rules
remain the same. We now have one network with a network address of
192.168.1.0 and a broadcast address of 192.168.1.127. The other
network will use a network address of 192.168.1.128 and a broadcast
address of 192.168.1.255.</p><p>In the same manner, we can continue slicing up our network
into four, eight, sixteen, thirty-two, ... networks. In fact,
starting at /8, we can slice and dice until we reach /30. Since we
have 32 numbers to work with, a /32 represents just one address,
and in this special case, there's no need for network or broadcast
addresses. That also means a /31 would represent two addresses, but
since one would be the network address and the other the broadcast
address, this would leave us with no host addresses&mdash;almost
certainly undesirable.</p><p>Under this scheme, the first octet of the netmask would
remain 255, but after that we could change any of the other
numbers. Instead of being restricted to 255 and 0, we may find
ourselves replacing the first zero in our netmask with any of 128,
192, 224, 240, 248, 252 or 254, except in the last octet as noted
above. The network and broadcast addresses would bind each subnet
(see <a href="3017t2.html" target="_self">Table 2</a> for details). Now,
any network can be referred to by its variable length subnet mask,
or the number of ones in the host portion of the address from /8 to
/32 (excepting /31). By extrapolation, each host can be referred to
directly by its IP address and the VLSM notation, so that it is
readily apparent what the network and broadcast addresses and
netmask are.</p><p>For example, if someone told me to assign my machine
192.168.0.50/27, I would know that the network address was
192.168.0.32, the broadcast address was 192.168.0.63, and the
netmask was 255.255.255.224. For those of you who still have
problems visualizing how this all translates, I've provided a chart
to assist you <a href="3017t3.html" target="_self">(Table 3)</a>.</p><p>You will find more uses for classless addressing than this.
CIDR can also give you a way to isolate departments in large
organizations to provide better security (by implementing internal
firewalls) and decrease traffic on any given network segment,
reducing collisions and increasing response times.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e88580.0x1f81580"></a>Private Address Groups</h2></div></div><p>Another way many companies can expand their pool of usable IP
addresses is to take advantage of the private IP addresses set
aside for companies and individuals not requiring direct Internet
access on all their machines. These numbers can be used as seen
fit.</p><p>By using a firewall or proxy server that performs network
address translation (NAT), called &ldquo;masquerading&rdquo; in the Linux
community, these machines can still connect to the Internet. The
bright side is you won't be routing internal company addresses to
the Internet, since most routers are set up to not route these
private addresses. Conversely, no one can directly access your
systems, so rogue web sites springing up in your company will not
come back to haunt you. In order for anyone to access an internal
computer, they would have to either log in to the proxy server
first, then continue in, or be redirected by the proxy through the
server to the designated machine.</p><p>The reference for those addresses we can make use of with no
prior coordination is RFC 1918, &ldquo;Address Allocation for Private
Internets&rdquo;, February 1996. These private addresses are as follows
(excerpt from RFC):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix)
172.16.0.0   - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix)
192.168.0.0  - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)
</pre><p>Note that under the old classful addressing, while the first
address segment is one Class A network, the second would actually
be 16 Class B networks, and the final segment 256 Class C networks.
By implementing a Linux gateway box and setting up some simple
rules in <span   class="bold"><b>ipfwadm</b></span> (generally
available with all Linux distributions), we can perform
masquerading or Network Address Translation, giving all computers
on the private network full Internet access. However, those on the
Internet cannot get to any of the computers with private addresses
unless one of two things happens. One, the administrator sets up
the gateway to act as a proxy server; proxying requests on a
particular port to a particular computer, or two, by the Internet
user using TELNET to access the gateway box first, then on to the
internal computers. Thus, private addresses stay private.
</p><p>These address groups can also be put to use in private
networks that piggy back on the Internet. By using two &ldquo;live&rdquo;
(non-private) IP addresses, one on each network's &ldquo;gateway&rdquo;
machine, we can tie two private networks together using Linux's
IPIP, IP tunneled inside IP. While this won't provide privacy
unless the two gateways are running an encryption program such as
<span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> (secure shell), it can provide
a virtual network.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e88580.0x1f818f0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>While live Internet addresses are becoming scarce, companies
and individuals can maximize use of their current address space and
even expand their address space through the use of private
addresses. CIDR can also be used to improve security and increase
network response time through subnetting.</p><p>By staying current with trends in such things as CIDR and
Linux's networking software, most obstacles to Internet and
Intranet connectivity can be easily circumvented. As CIDR provides
everyone with a way to maximize the little we have, private
addresses afford us the flexibility to expand beyond those
addresses provided by our Internet Service Provider.</p></div></div>
