    Mr. Williams presents a tool to handle all of your
    user-administration tasks.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x192e580.0x1a264a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of the most time-consuming tasks of
every system administrator (Linux or not) is user account
maintenance. Whether adding or removing accounts, or even
occasional suspending or enabling, it is definitely something that
can be done by a user other than root. Why spend time going through
a stack of papers on your desk with one thousand user accounts to
modify when the person who wrote the work orders in the first place
could just as easily do it?
</p><p>Now you may ask, &ldquo;How are these people supposed to do this
job? I am not giving out the root password!&rdquo; Well, to get around
the password problem, I have a quite simple response: use
<span   class="bold"><b>sudo</b></span> (pronounced soo-doo). You can
get this neat little gem from http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/.
<span   class="bold"><b>sudo</b></span> allows a permitted user to
execute a command as superuser (real and effective UID is set to 0,
and GID is set to root's group ID as set in the password file).
Using a utility like this, you can permit certain users to run
certain programs, such as an
<span   class="bold"><b>adduser</b></span> script or a
<span   class="bold"><b>chfn</b></span> command. Although certain
sanity checks must be in place, I have found sudo to be a viable
solution to keeping the root password secure.</p><p>To get around the problem of letting others mess with user
accounts, I created User Manager. Now I rarely spend time dealing
with user accounts. User management is done by the technicians, the
billing department and the salespeople. User Manager, primarily a
Korn shell script, does it all. (The Korn shell can be obtained
from ftp://ftp.cs.mun.ca/pub/pdksh/.)</p><p>The User Manager script is a framework for your system that
can be customized to add in RADIUS support, multi-homing support
and domain management. For example, one system I set up builds all
DNS, web and stats package configurations and sets up the user
account for a multi-home web customer. It was fairly simple to add
this support to the script, and it provides a great learning base
in system automation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x192e580.0x1a26818"></a>The Preparation</h2></div></div><p>The User Manager tar archive file can be found at
ftp://ftp.inetinc.net/pub/usrmgr/usrmgr.tgz. It includes the
<span   class="bold"><b>usrmgr</b></span> Korn shell script, a C
program and a simple Perl script, a README file, an INSTALL file
and an ASCII welcome screen. The C program, newpass.c, helps with
encrypting new user passwords and the Perl script, loginterp.pl,
generates reports from information logged when User Manager is
run.</p><p>In order to configure the User Manager software, you should
know the locations of several common utilities on your system. Some
of these include <span   class="bold"><b>finger</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>edquota</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>sort</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>mail</b></span>. You can see the complete
list in the sidebar <a href="3050s1.html" target="_self">&ldquo;Programs and their
Locations&rdquo;</a>. Make sure all of these are set correctly in
usrmgr before running the script. If they are not, the script will
not execute properly&mdash;steps may be left out.</p><p>Once you have the locations of the programs set up, you have
some choices to make. Where do you want your log file to go? Where
do you want the scripts to reside? Which administrator (or
administrators) will be receiving e-mail messages noting the user's
actions? Here are the answers I gave when I set up my
system:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Log File <b  >-&gt;</b>
/usr/local/adm/usrmgr.logfile</p></li><li><p>Scripts Reside in <b  >-&gt;</b>
/usr/local/usrmgr</p></li><li><p>Administrators <b  >-&gt;</b>
brw,matt,billing@inetinc.net</p></li></ul></div><p>Note that the administrators can be local user names and/or
full Internet e-mail addresses. For multiple entries, simply
separate each address with a comma and no spaces.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x192e580.0x1a27000"></a>The Report Generator</h2></div></div><p>The reports generated by User Manager's Perl script can be
very helpful tools, not only for your system administration team
but also for the billing and administrative personnel at your
company. With sudo installed, the reports list the user name of
each person who ran User Manager, instead of just logging
everything as root. Listings 1 and 2 show the two different report
formats available.</p><p>The simple log in <a href="3050l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>
is summary information aimed at system administrators. It lists the
number of <span   class="bold"><b>adds</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>suspends</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>enables</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>deletes</b></span> performed by each user and
can be used to track any unwanted or unauthorized users who might
be abusing User Manager. If you set up your system to allow only
administrators to access User Manager through sudo, you can easily
track malicious activity by checking what root is doing. If the
machine where I obtained the Listing 1 data was a production
machine, I would be very wary of the one
<span   class="bold"><b>add</b></span> done by root, and would check
the detailed logs for more information.</p><p><a href="3050l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a> shows a more
detailed report that can be turned on or off by setting verbose to
0 or 1 in the loginterp.pl script. My personal recommendation is to
leave it on so that you can send these reports to your billing and
account managing crew. It is also helpful in investigating any
malicious activities which may have shown up in the summary
reports.</p><p>For example, one entry in the summary report detected root
doing an add to a user's record:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Function Performed:  User Added
Done by:    root
Login:     jhanish
Password:    ilovesouthpark
UID:      1003
GID:      1003
Real Name:   Joe Hanish
Home:      /home/jhanish
Shell:     /bin/tcsh
Date:      07.29.1998
</pre><p>One might deduce that a possible security hole was exploited
and now a new user, <span   class="bold"><b>jhanish</b></span>, has
been added to the system. So, we take a look at the /etc/passwd
entry to see what else may have happened.
<pre     class="programlisting">
jhanish:x:0:1003:Joe Hanish:/home/jhanish:/bin/tcsh
</pre>


In this case, after adding himself to the system, he then created a
back door to access the system as root if he wished. Of course, a
skilled hacker would not leave traces like this, but someone just
playing around can easily be caught.
</p><p>You may want to set a <span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span>
job to run loginterp.pl on a weekly or monthly basis to generate
report files and send them automatically to administrators through
e-mail. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
6 0 1 * * root /usr/local/bin/loginterp.pl |
mail -s UserMGRLogs root,billing
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x192e580.0x1a276e0"></a>The Scalability</h2></div></div><p>User Manager was built as a basic shell for all your user
managing functions. As a system administrator, I realize every
system has a unique function, operating system and system
administrator's style of managing. User Manager gives you a
platform on which to create a customized software package to handle
everything you do when managing users. This will give you time to
do more interesting tasks without worrying about whether you missed
a step in the process.</p><p>One other application for this script could be to add in
web-hosting support. An ISP that hosts web sites could automate all
the steps required to add customers to its systems. To do this,
start with the User Manager framework and add in the other
steps.</p><p>For example, one system I am familiar with is a small
web-hosting company that has two main servers. The second server is
really only a backup mail spooling system and a secondary DNS. Even
though this is a simple example of added functionality in User
Manager, the concept can be applied across an infinite number of
servers and/or locations.</p><p>The User Manager software is on the main system. Once a web
customer is added, the script goes out and builds the DNS record,
rebuilds the /etc/named.boot file on the fly, passes the
configuration to the secondary name server and rebuilds its
/etc/named.boot file. After all the configurations are built, it
reloads each name server's database.</p><p>Once all the DNS is complete, it then takes care of the
/etc/sendmail.cw file (this step always caused me problems) and
sends a HUP signal to <span   class="bold"><b>sendmail</b></span> to
get it to recognize the changes. When that is done, it actually
adds the user account. It then builds the
<span   class="bold"><b>httpd</b></span> configuration on the fly as
well as the <span   class="bold"><b>stats</b></span> package
configuration.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x192e580.0x1a27a50"></a>The Solution</h2></div></div><p>User Manager is the solution to all your user-administration
problems. With the added help of sudo and the report generation
program, user management is no longer a worry. Due to the script's
scalability and robustness, it can be ported to any system with
ease. Even a BSD password database system can have User Manager
running on it. Because it is written as a Korn script, it is not
limited by any flavor of UNIX. It can be every system
administrator's friend and might even cut your work week down
dramatically, giving you some time for the things that truly matter
in life.</p></div></div>
