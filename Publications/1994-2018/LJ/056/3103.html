Everyone wants to know about the new kernel in 2.2. What new
features have been added? Anything going away?
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3103.jpg"></div>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Most of the new 2.2
features are about performance, especially on high-end hardware.
The SMP support is much better, and the kernel is more aggressive
about caching file names, etc. Also, it works on more
hardware.</p><p>There have been some nervous people wondering whether it
would still work on the small machines, and I essentially spent the
last week making sure it still does. We had some tweaks that needed
to be made simply because there had been bit-rot with respect to
small machine behaviour&mdash;none of the main developers use small
machines much during the development phase.</p><p>Features going away? I think we're phasing out some of the
support for things that people no longer seem to be using very
actively, so yes, some of the esoteric code may be gone, partly
because nobody cared to maintain it. On the whole, it's all there,
larger and better than ever.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: You seem to be
quite excited about the addition of SMP&mdash;tell us about it. Will
having this feature open new doors for Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: We had SMP support in
2.0 too, thanks mainly to Alan Cox. The new thing about 2.2 is that
the SMP support is no longer just a tacked-on feature no one
actually trusts, but is much better integrated. I've done all my
development on SMP machines for the last year and a half.</p><p>With 2.2, the Linux SMP code comes of age&mdash;it's still not a
stately old statesman, but more like a boisterous young
teenager&mdash;it's there and it's reliable. It's going to be polished
up in the future, because we're still cutting some corners to get
it up easily and reliably, but now it's really more a matter of
polishing than rewriting completely.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: I've been talking
to one of the local ISPs, and they have been having problems with
both NFS and NIS. The main problem with NIS is that the newest
version hasn't been ported to the SPARC. Has any work been done in
these areas? Who is working on it?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: I have to admit I
haven't followed the SPARC port very closely at all. Mostly I've
been involved with the Alpha, and even that has been surpassed by
my main interest in SMP. You'd better ask others about the SPARC
side.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Is there anything
different in the installation procedures that users should be
watching out for?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: When it comes to the
kernel, not really. The module loading is different, and some of
the system utilities need to be reasonably current with the latest
kernels, but on the whole if you have a reasonably recent
distribution, you can just plop in a new kernel and it will work
(apart from maybe upgrading your
<span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span>, etc., details).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What do you think
is missing from Linux? What new features will we be seeing in the
future?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: There are many &ldquo;big
system&rdquo; features we haven't quite gotten to yet, but little that
impacts most users. Clustering, high-end SMP scalability (expecting
scaling from 8 to 32 CPUs is fairly unrealistic right now),
journaling file systems, etc. Few people need them; the ones who do
will get them done eventually.</p><p>I think most of the missing functionality a lot of people
care about tends to be in &ldquo;user land&rdquo; rather than the kernel.
That was true some time ago; it's become even more true these days.
Happily, it's also being addressed more, both on a high-end server
scale (Oracle, etc.) and on a lower-end desktop scale (Corel, KDE,
Gnome, etc.).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What is the status
of Wabi and Wine? Will the time come when MS Windows 95 and 98
programs will run on Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: I don't think you'll
see all Windows programs running, but yes, I still believe that
Wine can do it. (Wabi seems to be a dead product, and fairly
uninteresting these days since it does only 16-bit programs.) Wine
is still improving, and some people are actually using it for what
they need (mainly Quicken and a few games, it seems).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Do you think a
standard GUI is a necessity for Linux? Will any of the currently
available desktops (KDE, GNOME, etc.) fill the bill?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: I don't think it's a
necessity to have a <span   class="emphasis"><em>standard</em></span> GUI. We need a
better interface than plain X and TWM, but FVWM took us a long way,
and KDE and Gnome are tackling the integration and complete desktop
issues rather than just the window manager. I think we'll end up
with both KDE and Gnome for awhile, and they'll eventually do the
same things and work pretty much the same. Then you'll choose
whichever you like more, because all the programs you want to run
will run on both.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: People always ask
you, &ldquo;What direction do you want to see Linux take?&rdquo; Let's
reverse that: &ldquo;What directions do you want to make sure Linux does
not take?&rdquo;</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: I want to make sure
Linux doesn't stagnate. I like to see new areas open up&mdash;the people
who did the port of Linux to the PalmPilot must be crazy, but I
enjoyed seeing that kind of thing happen.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: When did you
realize that the &ldquo;chaos Linux development&rdquo; model was really
working?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: I had never realized
it wouldn't work. It wasn't planned chaos, and I never thought
there would be problems. And there never really were. It worked out
of the box&mdash;it's just scaling up to a larger scale.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: You seem to be at
every show that involves Linux. How do you balance traveling, work
and family and stay sane?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Lots of
medication.</p><p>Heh. Actually, I haven't been traveling too much lately. I
did a reasonable amount of flying earlier this summer because there
were a few conferences close to each other, but on the whole I try
to avoid going to too many conferences. They're fun, but only when
done in moderation.</p><p>Not traveling still doesn't mean I have tons of free time,
obviously, and there have certainly been some weeks when I
considered myself too busy. Things tend to calm down every once in
a while, and I can take a breather.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What can you tell
us about working at Transmeta? (Or is it still a secret?)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: I still can't tell
you anything but that it's a ton of fun.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: On a personal
note, tell us about your family and living in the U.S.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: We like it here. My
younger daughter was born here, and as such is a dual citizen of
both the U.S. and Finland. We haven't really had too many problems
getting used to it being sunny all the time, and going around in
T-shirts and shorts for 70% of the year.</p><p>We've had a few silly paperwork issues (can you believe
getting a driver's license took nine months because it had to go
through the INS?), but all in all, it's been very enjoyable.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What's your
favorite breakfast?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Breakfast? You have
time to eat breakfast? I drink a cup of cappuccino every morning to
wake up.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Any words of
wisdom you'd like to leave us with?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Nope. &ldquo;Be good to
each other&rdquo; and &ldquo;don't you eat that yellow snow&rdquo; have both
already been taken.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Thanks for your
time.</p></div></div>
