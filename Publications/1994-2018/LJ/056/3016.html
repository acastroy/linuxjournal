    Mr. Bandel takes a look at system initialization for various
    distributions.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d57580.0x1e4f4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>As the title indicates, I will discuss,
in one form or another, how Linux system initialization works.
System initialization starts where the kernel bootup ends. Among
the topics I intend to explain include system initialization
&agrave; la Slackware&mdash;a BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)
knock-off&mdash;as well as System V (five) initialization &agrave; la
Red Hat, Caldera, Debian, et al., and also point out the
differences between them. You'll soon see that the systems are
truly more similar than they are different, despite appearances to
the contrary. I will also cover passing switches through LILO to
init during the boot process&mdash;this is used mostly for emergencies.
</p><p>What I will not discuss (for brevity's sake) are the details
in some of Red Hat's, Caldera's or other initialization scripts,
specifically configuration information found in the /etc/sysconfig
or /etc/modules directories. For those details, you're on your own.
Besides, those details are more subject to change from one release
to the next.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d57580.0x1e4f608"></a>BSD vs. System V</h2></div></div><p>Back in the days when UNIX was young, many universities
obtained &ldquo;free&rdquo; copies of the operating system (OS) and made
improvements and enhancements. One was the University of California
at Berkeley. This school made significant contributions to the OS,
which were later adopted by other universities. A parallel
development began in a more commercial environment and eventually
evolved into what is now System V. While these two parallel systems
shared a common kernel and heritage, they evolved into competing
systems. Differences can be found in initialization, switches used
by a number of common commands (such as <b  >ps</b>:
under BSD, <b  >ps aux</b> is equivalent to System V's
<b  >ps -ef</b>), inter-process communications (IPC),
printing and streams. While Linux has adopted System V inits for
most distributions, the BSD command syntax is still predominant. As
for IPC, both are available and in general use in Linux
distributions. Linux also uses BSD-style printcaps and lacks
support for streams.</p><p>Under initialization, the biggest difference between the two
(BSD and System V) is in the use of
<span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> scripts. System V makes use
of run levels and independent stand-alone initialization scripts.
Scripts are run to start and stop daemons depending on the runlevel
(also referred to as the system state), one script per daemon or
process subsystem. System V states run from 0 to 6 by default, each
runlevel corresponding to a different mode of operation; often,
even these few states are not all used. BSD has only two modes
(equivalent to System V's runlevels), single-user mode (sometimes
referred to as maintenance mode) and multi-user mode. All daemons
are started essentially by two (actually more like four to six )
scripts&mdash;a general systems script, either rc.K or rc.M for single-
or multi-user mode, respectively, a local script and a couple of
special scripts, rc.inet and rc.inet2. The systems script is
usually provided by the distribution creator; the local script is
edited by the system administrator and tailored to that particular
system. The BSD-style scripts are not independent, but are called
sequentially. (The BSD initialization will be most familiar to
those coming from the DOS world.) The two main scripts can be
compared to config.sys and autoexec.bat, which, by the way, call
one or two other scripts. However, the likeness ends there. Having
only these few scripts to start everything does not allow for the
kind of flexibility System V brings (or so say some). It does,
however, make things easier to find. In System V circles (but only
in System V circles), BSD initialization is considered
obsolete&mdash;but what do they know? Like a comfortable pair of shoes,
it won't be discarded for a very long time, if ever.</p><p>Recall that earlier I said Slackware did a BSD knock-off, and
yet it still uses the rc.S/rc.M, et al., scripts. This is because
<span   class="bold"><b>inittab</b></span>, (which we'll look at
later) uses the same references to runlevels, and uses those (very
much System V) runlevels to decide which scripts to run. In fact,
the same <span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> binary is used by
all the distributions I have looked at, so there is really less
difference between Slackware and Red Hat or Debian than appears on
the surface, not at all like older BSD systems that reference only
modes &ldquo;S&rdquo; or &ldquo;M&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d57580.0x1e4f9d0"></a>init: Where It All Begins</h2></div></div><p>Once the kernel boots, we have a running Linux system. It
isn't very usable, since the kernel doesn't allow direct
interactions with &ldquo;user space&rdquo;. So, the system runs one program:
<span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span>. This program is responsible
for everything else and is regarded as the father of all processes.
The kernel then retires to its rightful position as system manager
handling &ldquo;kernel space&rdquo;. First, init reads any parameters passed
to it from the command line. This command line was the LILO prompt
you saw before the system began to boot the kernel. If you had more
than one kernel to choose from, you chose it by name and perhaps
put some other boot parameters on the line with it. Any parameters
the kernel didn't need, were passed to init. These command-line
options override any options contained in init's configuration
file. As a good inspection of what's really going on will tell you,
runlevels are just a convenient way to group together &ldquo;process
packages&rdquo; via software. They hold no special significance to the
kernel.</p><p>When init starts, it reads its configuration from a file
called <span   class="bold"><b>inittab</b></span> which stands for
initialization table. Any defaults in inittab are discarded if
they've been overridden on the command line. The inittab file tells
init how to set up the system. Sample Slackware, Red Hat and Debian
inittabs are included later in this article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d57580.0x1e4fbe0"></a>inittab Specifics</h2></div></div><p>Reading inittab, we'll be skipping any lines that begin with
a &ldquo;#&rdquo;, since these are comments and ignored by init. The rest of
the lines can be easily read as many other typical UNIX-like
configuration tables, i.e., each column is separated by a &ldquo;:&rdquo;
(<b  ><i><tt>id</tt></i>:<i><tt>runlevel</tt></i>:<i><tt>action</tt></i>:<i><tt>process</tt></i></b>)
and can be read as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>id</em></span>: This first column is a
unique identifier for the rest of the line. On newer Linux systems,
it may be up to four alphanumeric characters long, but is typically
limited to two. Older systems had a two-character limitation, and
most distributions have not changed that custom.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>runlevel</em></span>: The second column
indicates what runlevel(s) this row is valid for. This column may
be null or contain any number of valid runlevels.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>action</em></span>: This can be several
different things, the most common being <b  >respawn</b>,
but can also be any one of the following: <b  >once</b>,
<b  >sysinit</b>, <b  >boot</b>,
<b  >bootwait</b>, <b  >wait</b>,
<b  >off</b>, <b  >ondemand</b>,
<b  >initdefault</b>, <b  >powerwait</b>,
<b  >powerfail</b>, <b  >powerokwait</b>,
<b  >ctrlaltdel</b> or
<b  >kbrequest</b>.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>process</em></span>: This is the specific
process or program to be run.</p></li></ul></div><p>Each row in inittab has a specific, unique identifier.
Normally, you will want this to be something easily associated with
the specific action performed. For example, if you want to put a
<span   class="bold"><b>getty</b></span> on the first serial port,
you might use the identifier <b  >s1</b>. When I execute
<span   class="bold"><b>w</b></span> to see what processes are
running, I can more easily identify who is logged in via the modem
on com1 when that user is identified as being on s1.
</p><p>The runlevels are identified as 0 to 6 and A to C by default.
Runlevels 0, 1 and 6 are special and should not be changed
casually. These correspond to system halt, maintenance mode and
system reboot, respectively. Changing runlevel 1, for example, can
have far-reaching consequences. Note that to enter maintenance mode
(state 1), you can pass init (via <span   class="emphasis"><em>telinit2</em></span>)
the argument <b  >1</b>. Alternately, you can use
<b  >S</b> or <b  >s</b> for maintenance mode.
If you change what transpires for state 1, the same changes will
apply when <b  >S</b> or <b  >s</b> is passed.
However, runlevels 2 through 5 can be customized as desired.</p><p>Many systems have the command
<span   class="bold"><b>runlevel</b></span> (usually found in /sbin).
Executing this command will output the previous runlevel and the
present runlevel as follows: <b  >N 2</b>. The
<b  >N</b> indicates no previous runlevel. If you make a
change, say, to state 3 and then reissue the runlevel command,
you'll see <b  >2 3</b>.</p><p>Since a good demonstration will illustrate better than just
telling you about it, try this on your system. (Note that I have
done this successfully on Debian 1.3 and a few others, such as an
older Red Hat [perhaps 3.0], but not many others, so your mileage
may vary.) As root (only root can tell init to change states),
issue the init command. You should see a usage message telling you
to pass init an argument consisting of a number from 0 to 6, the
letters A to C or S or Q. Lowercase letters are syntactically the
same as their uppercase counterparts. If you pass init anything
other than legal values, you should receive this same usage
message. Now pass init the argument <b  >8</b>, as in
<b  >init&nbsp;8</b> (or <b  >telinit 8</b>, if
you wish). If nothing appears to happen, don't worry. Now type
<b  >runlevel</b> again, and you should see <b  >2
8</b>. If you don't have runlevel on your system, try
<b  >ps ax | grep init</b> and you may see <b  >init
[8]</b>. You may or may not see the runlevel listed in square
brackets. Once you have confirmed that you actually did change to
runlevel 8, change back to your previous runlevel. Note that,
should your gettys die, they won't respawn at this runlevel, so you
could have a problem logging in again after you log out. If you are
unsure what your default runlevel is, look in inittab near the top
for a line where the first column is <b  >id</b> and the
third is <b  >initdefault</b>. The second column in this
line is the default runlevel. An example line looks like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
id:3:initdefault
</pre><p>This demonstration was designed to show you that while
runlevels 7 to 9 are undocumented, they actually are available for
use should you need them. (I'll explain later why nothing happened
when you changed states). They aren't used only because it's not
customary. The customizable states for Linux (2 through 5) are
usually more than sufficient for anyone.
</p><p>The letters A to C are used when you want to spawn a daemon
listed in inittab and have this &ldquo;runlevel&rdquo; designation on a
one-time basis (on demand). Therefore, telling init to change to
state C doesn't change the runlevel, it just performs the action
listed on the line where the runlevel is listed as C. Perhaps you
want to put a getty on a port to receive a call, but only after
receiving a voice call first (not every time). Let's further
suppose you want to be ready to receive either a data call or a fax
call, and when you get the voice message, you'll know which you
want. You can put two lines in inittab, each with its own ID, and
each with a runlevel such as A for data and B for fax. When you
know which you need, you simply spawn the appropriate one from a
command line: <b  >telinit A</b> or <b  >telinit
B</b>. The appropriate getty will be put on the line until
the first call is received. Once the caller terminates the
connection, the getty will drop, because by definition, an
on-demand process will not respawn.</p><p>The other two letters, S and Q, are special. As I noted
earlier, S will bring your system to maintenance mode which is the
same as changing state to runlevel 1. The Q is necessary to tell
init to reread inittab. <span   class="bold"><b>inittab</b></span>
may be changed as often as required, but will be read only under
certain circumstances: one of its processes dies (do we need to
respawn another?), on a powerfail signal from a power daemon (or
the command line), or when told to change state by telinit. So the
Q argument will tell init, &ldquo;I've changed something, please reread
the inittab.&rdquo;</p><p>Before I delve into sections grouped by distribution, I'd
like to emphasize that they don't stand alone. Each of the
following sections will complement the others.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d57580.0x215c158"></a>Slackware (BSD) inittab</h2></div></div><p>Let's take a look at the sample Slackware inittab in
<a href="3016l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>. I've numbered the lines
for easy reference. The numbers don't appear in your inittab&mdash;your
inittab will begin two spaces to the right of the line numbers.
Within the inittab file, lines beginning with a &ldquo;#&rdquo; sign are
disabled and left as explanatory remarks or examples for possible
future use. Be sure to read all the comments throughout; they were
inserted to help you and may give you a hint on how to better
customize your own inittab. Most programs, such as
<span   class="bold"><b>mgetty</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>efax</b></span>, that were meant to run from
inittab come with examples of how to implement them.</p><p>Since you already know how to read a line
(<b  >id:runlevel(s):action:process</b>), I'm going to
cover only those few lines of special interest.</p><p>As I've already mentioned, Slackware isn't a true BSD system
in the old style. Rather than having just a single-user mode and
multi-user mode, it actually uses runlevel 3 as its default
runlevel. It runs a system initialization script first, rc.S. This
script is designed to be run only once at bootup. Then it runs
rc.M. It skips the line with rc.K unless a system operator
intervenes and deliberately changes to that state. When changing
states between single-user and multi-user modes, the appropriate
script is called. (See Listing 1, lines 15, 18 and 21.)</p><p>rc.0 and rc.6 are each files that are also run when the
system is brought down. (See Listing 1, lines 27 and 30.)</p><p>You will see power management (UPS power management) handled
in the script as well as the <b  >ctrl-alt-del</b> key
sequence. (See Listing 1, lines 24, 33, 36 and 39.)</p><p>Something odd you should notice about this inittab (which was
lifted straight from a distribution CD): while the default init
runlevel is 3, if a power daemon signals the system to shut down,
then power is restored, the shutdown is canceled, and the system is
brought back up at runlevel 5. However, since runlevels 3 and 5 are
essentially identical (they run the same rc scripts), there is no
difference in this case.</p><p>Now we come to the standard part which all inittabs were
specifically designed to handle: initializing and respawning
gettys. When UNIX was young, dumb terminals hung off serial ports.
These dumb terminals were called teletype terminals or simply TTYs.
So, the program that sent a login screen to the tty was called
<span   class="bold"><b>getty</b></span> for &ldquo;get TTY&rdquo;. Today's
getty performs the same basic function, although the TTY today is
not likely to be quite so dumb. Adding and subtracting virtual
terminals is as easy as adding or subtracting lines in the inittab;
you can have up to 255.</p><p>Next, you'll see a line that allows the X Display Manager
(XDM) to be respawned in runlevel 4.</p><p>About the only thing I haven't mentioned is that the scripts
which do all the work on the Slackware system are all located in
/etc/rc.d. Look them over. Slackware uses a minimal number of
scripts to start background processes. Specifically referenced by
inittab are rc.S, rc.K, rc.M, rc.0 and rc.6. Called by scripts
(such as rc.M), but not by init, are rc.inet, rc.inet2, rc.local,
rc.serial and others.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d57580.0x215c730"></a>Sys V inittab (&agrave; la Red Hat)</h2></div></div><p>Take a look at the Red Hat inittab
<a href="3016l2.html" target="_self">(Listing 2)</a>. In this file are some
good explanations of what Red Hat does with runlevels. I won't
belabor it further here. Note that the runlevels chosen for use by
Red Hat are just one convention and not indicative of all System V
UNIX systems, not even other Linux System V initializations.</p><p>As you can see, Red Hat defaults to runlevel 3, but you can
change this to 5 once you have the X server properly configured.
(See Listing 2, lines 18 and 56.) Given the number of graphical
tools Red Hat has put together, you'd think they'd encourage the
use of runlevel 5, but using that as the out-of-the-box default
would cause trouble if X was not properly configured first.</p><p>Just below the default runlevel, you'll see the system
initialization script (Listing 2, line 21). This is run once when
the system boots. Then init jumps down to (in this case) line 13
(Listing 2, line 26). The lines for 10 through 12 and 14 through 16
are skipped because our default runlevel is 3.</p><p>Notice that <span   class="bold"><b>ud</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>ca</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>pf</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>pr</b></span> run regardless of the runlevel.
When the runlevel column is null, the process is run in every
runlevel.</p><p>The getty lines should look familiar to you. Don't be
bothered by the fact that Red Hat chose
<span   class="bold"><b>mingetty</b></span> over getty. They both do
the same thing: send a login banner to the tty.</p><p>Finally, runlevel 5 spawns XDM (X Display Manager).</p><p>Under Red Hat, you'll find all the system initialization
scripts in /etc/rc.d. This subdirectory has even more
subdirectories&mdash;one for each runlevel: rc0.d to rc6.d and init.d.
Within the /etc/rc.d/rc#.d subdirectories (where the # is replaced
by a single digit number) are links to the master scripts stored in
/etc/rc.d/init.d. The scripts in init.d take an argument of
<b  >start</b> or <b  >stop</b>, and
occasionally <b  >reload</b> or
<b  >restart</b>.</p><p>The links in the /etc/rc.d/rc#.d directories all begin with
either an <b  >S</b> or a <b  >K</b> for start
or kill respectively, a number which indicates a relative order for
the scripts and the script name&mdash;commonly the same name as the
master script found in init.d to which it is linked. For example,
S20lpd will run the script <span   class="bold"><b>lpd</b></span> in
init.d with the argument <b  >start</b> which starts up
the line-printer daemon. The scripts can also be called from the
command line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/rc.d/init.d/lpd start
</pre><p>The nice part about System V initialization is that it is
easy for root to start, stop, restart or reload a daemon or process
subsystem from the command line simply by calling the appropriate
script in init.d with the argument <b  >start</b>,
<b  >stop</b>, <b  >reload</b> or
<b  >restart</b>.
</p><p>When not called from a command line with an argument, the
<span   class="bold"><b>rc</b></span> script parses the command line.
If it is running K20lpd, it runs the lpd init script with a
<b  >stop</b> argument. When init has followed the link
in inittab to rc.d/rc3.d, it begins by running all scripts that
start with a K in numerical order from lowest to highest, then
likewise for the S scripts. This ensures that the correct daemons
are running in each runlevel, and are stopped and started in the
correct order. For example, you can't start
<span   class="bold"><b>sendmail</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>bind</b></span>/<span   class="bold"><b>named</b></span>
(Berkeley DNS or Domain Name Service daemon) before you start
networking. The BSD-style script Slackware uses will start
networking early in the rc.M script, but you must always be
cognizant of order whenever you modify Slackware startup scripts.
Remember when we changed to runlevel 8 above and nothing happened?
Since no subdirectory rc8.d exists and consequently no kill or
start scripts, no scripts were run when we changed states. Had we
come from boot directly to runlevel 8, we would have had a problem.
Only the kernel, init and those daemons started via the
<span   class="bold"><b>sysinit</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>boot</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>bootwait</b></span> commands in the inittab
would have been running. I'll let you look at the scripts in the
../init.d/ directory for yourself, but an example for those with
Slackware systems is shown in <a href="3016l3.html" target="_self">Listing
3</a>.</p><p>For those who find editing links to add or delete scripts in
any particular runlevel a tedious task or who are just not
comfortable doing this, Red Hat distributes a program called
<span   class="bold"><b>tksysv</b></span>. This program uses a
graphical interface (using Tcl/Tk) to read the script names in
/etc/rc.d/init.d and displays them on the far left side of the
application box. If you have a system with init.d in a different
location, you can install symbolic links (for each of the rc#.d
directories) and it will function just fine, or hack the script and
customize it to your system. The system also reads the links in
each of the rc#.d subdirectories and displays them for each
runlevel from left to right with start scripts above and kill
scripts below. (See Figure 1.) You can add, delete and even change
the order of execution as you see fit.</p><p><a href="3016f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
System V Runlevel Manager</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d57580.0x215d6a8"></a>SysV inittab (&agrave; la Debian)</h2></div></div><p>Now take a look at the sample Debian inittab. While similar
to Red Hat's inittab, it also has some differences. First, you'll
notice that while Red Hat used runlevel 3 for non-graphical mode
and runlevel 5 for graphical mode, Debian uses runlevel 2 for both
(see <a href="3016l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a>, line 5). The
difference is in Debian's use of a start/kill script for
XDM.</p><p>I'd also like to draw your attention to a very special line,
line 12. The line begins with &ldquo;~~&rdquo; (two tildes). Note that in
single-user mode (state 1 or S),
<span   class="bold"><b>sulogin</b></span> is called. This prevents
someone from just booting the system and becoming root. While it
doesn't prevent other tricks from being used to &ldquo;back door&rdquo; the
system and isn't a substitute for physical security of the system,
it does prevent the casual user from obtaining root access simply
by rebooting. The use of the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
boot from c: only, vice boot a: then c:
</pre><p>combined with password protection of the BIOS setup screens,
and a lock on the case to prevent someone from resetting the BIOS
on the motherboard, and finally setting LILO to 0 seconds, the
computer is almost 50% of the way to being secured from
unauthorized tampering. (You can get almost another 45% from the
system itself, but note that the last 5% is effectively out of
reach.)
</p><p>Just below the script calls for each runlevel is another line
to put a login screen up for root in runlevel 6. This is only for
emergencies, should something go wrong with the kill scripts in
runlevel 6 and the system does not halt properly. It should never
run. (See Listing 3, lines 22 to 30).</p><p>The Debian inittab also includes some examples to enable
gettys on modem and serial lines, should you find a use for them.
The line that invokes mgetty, however, will obviously not work
unless you've installed the mgetty package.</p><p>Following the logic through a boot-up, during a normal boot
<span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> knows it will run in state 2.
Armed with this information and not overridden during boot-up, init
first runs the /etc/init.d/boot script. Once this script has run,
init then executes /etc/init.d/rc with an argument of 2.
<span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> also runs the commands
associated with <span   class="bold"><b>ca</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>kb</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>pf</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>pn</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>po</b></span>. If you read up on
<span   class="bold"><b>powerfail</b></span>, you'll see that nothing
will happen until a change occurs with the power. Next, we see that
init spawns gettys on the virtual terminals. In this case (runlevel
2), it will spawn six (see Listing 4, lines 50-55). The rest of the
lines are commented out, and not used.</p><p>Looking at the /etc/init.d/rc script, you can see how it
determines what to run to achieve a state change or to bring the
system to the initial state.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d57580.0x23d8798"></a>Emergencies</h2></div></div><p>Editing inittab or any of the rc scripts requires some degree
of caution. Even the best tests cannot simulate a complete system
reboot, and a script may appear to function properly after a system
has initialized but fail during system initialization. The reasons
are diverse, but usually involve getting things out of
order.</p><p>In Caldera's Network Desktop, which ran on a 1.2.13 kernel
and used modules, I had modified a script to start the
<span   class="bold"><b>kerneld</b></span> process early in the boot
sequence. When I upgraded the system to Caldera's OpenLinux v1.0
which ran a 2.0.25 kernel, I made the exact same changes to the
same script, tested it and when I was satisfied all was well, I
rebooted. Much to my dismay, the boot process hung, and guess
where&mdash;yes, loading kerneld. I found that in the newer kernels,
kerneld needed to know the host name of the computer, which was not
yet available. Things like this can happen to anyone. Something as
simple as typing the wrong key or forgetting to give the full path
name of a file can leave you in the lurch.</p><p>Fortunately, you can pass boot-time parameters to init. When
the system boots and you see: <b  >LILO:</b>, you can
press the <b  >shift</b> key, then the
<b  >tab</b> key to see the kernel labels available for
booting. You can then add a kernel label and follow it by any
required parameters to boot the system. Any parameters the kernel
needs are used and discarded. For example, if you have more than
64MB of RAM, you need to pass that information to the kernel in the
form <b  >mem=96MB</b>. If you pass the
<b  >-b</b> switch, the kernel won't use it, but will
pass it on to init. The same goes for any single-digit number or
the letters S or Q in either upper or lower case.</p><p>By passing any of the numbers or letters to init, we are
overriding the defaults in inittab, as I stated earlier. Most of
these numbers or letters do exactly what they would do if passed
from a command line on a running system. However, the
<b  >-b</b> is special: it is the emergency boot
parameter. This parameter tells init to read the inittab, but for
some special exceptions not to execute any of the commands, just
drop into maintenance mode. Thus, no rc scripts will be executed.
You may mount the system read-write and fix it. One exception to
not executing any inittab commands is the process id ~~ that should
have as its process <b  >sulogin</b>. This will give you
a prompt for root's password so no unauthorized person can alter
system files such as /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow.</p><p>What if you've made a mistake in the inittab file? Can the
system be saved? Yes, but I must warn you not to do this unless
absolutely necessary. Coded into the kernel is the instruction to
start init once it is completely loaded and in memory. If the
/etc/inittab is corrupted to the point that init can't run, not
even with the <b  >-b</b> switch (I've personally never
seen this), it is possible to tell the Linux kernel to run a
different program at bootup instead of init. Instead of issuing the
<b  >-b</b> switch, substitute
<b  >init=/bin/sh</b> after the kernel name. This will
cause the kernel to run the bash shell, and you will be logged in
as root. Be careful here, as nothing else is running, e.g., system
logging or the update daemon. This is not a normal mode of
operation for the system. Fix whatever is necessary and
reboot.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d57580.0x23d8dc8"></a>Standards</h2></div></div><p>Now that I've explained a significant part of how Linux
system initialization works, I'll tell you how Linux compares to
some of the systems I've worked with.</p><p>For BSD-style systems, the first time I saw Slackware, I was
amazed at its similarity in boot-up to Ultrix which I was using on
some DEC-5000s&mdash;it has the same structure with the rc scripts in
/etc/rc.d and the same names. If Slackware used any system as a
pattern, Ultrix could have been one of them. I haven't used any
newer BSD-style systems, so I cannot comment further.</p><p>For System V, I can compare the various Linux distributions
to several others. The one with the most resemblance seems to be
Sun Solaris, which uses the same structure as Debian, but uses
runlevel 3 as its default and implements XDM startup as Debian.
Also, runlevel 5 is used for system shutdown, and the rc scripts
are moved to /sbin. HP-UX 10.20 is also similar, but HP puts the
init.d, rc.d and other runlevel directories under /sbin. IBM's AIX
uses System V style initialization, but with most of the individual
scripts for subprocesses called directly from its inittab. Finally,
SCO OpenServer uses a system similar to Debian for its boot-time
initialization, but does not use symbolic links to init.d. Instead,
all start-kill scripts are located in rc2.d.</p><p>The latest Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) v2.0 for Linux
dated 26 October 1997 states either BSD or System V style
initialization is acceptable. It stopped short, however, of
outlining exactly where the rc scripts would go, except to say they
would be below /etc, and future revisions to the standard may
provide further guidance. I find that unlikely, since Red Hat and
Debian, both very popular distributions, do it a little
differently. I have no particular preference, and in fact my system
has symbolic links which make each look like the other in case an
install process makes an invalid assumption about how my systems
are configured. I will tell you that as lazy as I am, less typing
to start and stop daemons is more to my liking, so /etc/init.d/
gets my vote.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d57580.0x23d8fd8"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>While this article hasn't been all-encompassing by any means,
hopefully you've gained some knowledge of how your Linux system
initializes during boot-up. All these tables and scripts are simple
ASCII text files easily modified with
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> or any text editor of your
choice. Just read them and follow their logic. I've shown you how
to read and interpret /etc/inittab and provided you with basic
information regarding how init works.</p><p>I've also shown you how to recover in case you've managed to
create a script that hangs the boot process or prevents init from
starting. Take a look at your inittab and the scripts it runs to
better understand your system and optimize it for your own
