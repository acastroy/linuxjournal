mistake was made by the editors. In my submission I wrote:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Many UNIX editors allow some text to be processed
by the shell. Take for instance vi with:</p></blockquote></div><pre     class="programlisting">
        !}tr A-Z a-z
</pre><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>It replaces all uppercase characters of the next
paragraph to lowercase. Another example:</p></blockquote></div><pre     class="programlisting">
        !jtr a-z A-Z
</pre><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>This one capitalizes the current and next line
(the character after the &ldquo;!&rdquo; is a movement character).</p></blockquote></div><p>The editor changed this by prepending a &ldquo;:&rdquo; to the
commands. That is definitely wrong; in that case, you would start a
subshell and it would try to run <b  >}tr A-Z a-z</b> and
<b  >jtr a-z A-Z</b>. Both of which would most likely
fail. Without the &ldquo;:&rdquo; prepended, some lines of text (to be
determined by the movement character) are piped to tr and the
output is inserted back.

<span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span>) and the ways to check a PPP

programs or to direct syslog to Console 9 as one reader suggested.
I think the easiest way is to run
<span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> with the
<b  >-d</b> (debug) option and
<span   class="bold"><b>chat</b></span> with the
<b  >-v</b> (verbose) option and then, during the process

network monitoring and some form of gateway between UNIX and
Netware. It has never crashed once.

program listings. I know it is possible to get these listings if I
know the exact location/file name; however, if I don't remember
this, I am lost. I can browse the &ldquo;Table of Contents&rdquo; on the web
site and find the article in question, but there is no link or clue
as to where the program listings might be found. How about
including a link to each article's program listing from the web
site TOC?</p><p>&mdash;Jan Thomas Moldung janth@x2.hd.uib.no</p><p>Good suggestion-we've put links into the TOC. All listings
are located at ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue##/, where ##

off to my friends. One embarrassing problem for me lately has been
the need to boot from a floppy, because a hard drive was too large
for my BIOS and I couldn't configure LILO properly. A recent
response in the &ldquo;Best of Tech Support&rdquo; column supplied my answer,
and now it boots fine.</p><p>The technician who installed the drive under Windows 95 had
to shorten it to accommodate the BIOS and Windows 95. Linux has
allowed me to reclaim the rest of the drive and ditch Windows
95.</p><p>Your magazine is my favourite Linux resource.
Congratulations.</p><p>&mdash;Stephen Roach stroach@altnews.com.au</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d69580.0x1e62108"></a>Minor Correction&mdash;Issue 53</h2></div></div><p>I just finished another fine read&mdash;nice issue as always. One
minor error I noticed though is on page 45, &ldquo;Technical
Considerations&rdquo; by Richard Kent.</p><p>He says, &ldquo;Within these toolkits are functions which have a
variable number of arguments, much like the standard
<span   class="bold"><b>printf</b></span> system call.&rdquo;</p><p>Ah, and there's the rub&mdash;printf isn't a system call. It is a
function from the standard library (section 3). System calls are,
as you know, described in section 2.</p><p>I know this is minor, but students new to the C programming
language have enough trouble with the documentation and how to read
it without reference problems.</p><p>&mdash;Wayne Bjorken wab@courier.cb.lucent.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d69580.0x1e623c8"></a>How Many Distributions?</h2></div></div><p>I have done years of FORTRAN, C and assembly programming on
CPM, NS32000 and DOS systems, developing a system for operating
laboratory equipment, and processing and displaying experimental
data. After having seen so many platforms disappear, each time
forcing a painful migration, I have just begun moving to Linux. The
first issue I confronted, and resolved by making a semi-random
choice, was selecting the distribution. There seems to be no
guidance for newbies in this matter. After I got it installed, I
started trying to learn how to program it. Here I ran into another
obstacle. I have been spoiled by the packaged and documented
software from Borland. Now I have to find tools for Linux and
instructions for using them by looking in a huge collection of
books and Internet sites. I find there is a horrendously steep and
bewildering initial portion of the Linux learning curve, which
could easily be a barrier to many people. Distributions need to
address this if Linux is going to compete with MS Windows.</p><p>&mdash;Bill McConnaughey mcconnau@biochem.wustl.edu</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d69580.0x1e62528"></a>Interview with Charles Andres</h2></div></div><p>I read your interview with Charles Andres in the August, 1998
<i  >LJ</i> with great interest.</p><p>I just want to add one point on your question about &ldquo;How
does Sun feel about the Open Source movement?&rdquo; If Sun feels that
it might be advantageous for their business to give the source code
to everyone, they will do so. Proof of this statement: When Sun
tried to start a &ldquo;Motif vs. OpenLook&rdquo; war, they freely gave away
the source code of XView (which was one of the best X toolkits
around). It didn't help them win that war, but in the Linux
community XView can still be used (guess what I am looking at ...)
for free. All this happened long before the issue hit the
newsstands.</p><p>Same story with Netscape: if a company feels it can win
something, it will open the source. Sun will do it again if they
think it would be good for them, but they won't do it for political
or philosophical reasons.</p><p>&mdash;Erwin Dieterich e.dieterich@ndh.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d69580.0x1e62790"></a>I'm paying for the content, not
advertisements</h2></div></div><p>I have been reading <i  >Linux Journal</i> for
quite some time. It is a very informative magazine and I like it a
lot.</p><p>However, I cannot help noticing one very bad thing: the
portion of <i  >LJ</i> occupied by advertisements has
reached approximately one third of the entire magazine. It seems to
be growing even further at the cost of actual content.</p><p>While it is clear to me that you earn good money from the
advertisements, in the end you still need your subscribers. I am
afraid you might lose at least one, if you continue your
transformation from a journal into an advertising bulletin. I hope
you will realize this before it is too late.</p><p>&mdash;Denis Havlik havlik@lisa.exp.univie.ac.at</p><p>Actually, compared to other magazines, 30% advertising is
low. We need at least this much to stay in business without raising
subscription rates. Our November issue was at 35%. If advertising
either stabilizes or increases, we will most likely expand the
magazine by another 16 pages. It is also true that many readers
find value in the ads&mdash;I even had one who said we should increase
the number of ads &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d69580.0x1e62aa8"></a>About the Inventor Article</h2></div></div><p>I am Guy Barrand from Linear Accelerator Laboratory (LAL) at
Orsay (France).</p><p>In the article &ldquo;Open Inventor&rdquo; by Robert Hartley (September
1998), Mr. Hartley mentions the Apprentice project. I have looked
at the Apprentice code, and a question has occurred to me.</p><p>How far can one go in re-implementing commercial software? In
Apprentice, the API differs from that of Inventor only by the
prefix &ldquo;Ap&rdquo; that replaces the Inventor &ldquo;So&rdquo;. A good use of the
<span   class="bold"><b>tr</b></span> command (also documented in the
same issue of <i  >LJ</i>) could easily transform an
Apprentice distribution to an Inventor one. Does the Apprentice
developer have the right to use the &ldquo;So&rdquo; prefix?</p><p>In general, is it legal to reuse a commercial product API and
to provide a free implementation of this product? I assume that the
Linux community has looked at these problems for a long time. Can
you enlighten me on these points?</p><p>&mdash;Guy Barrand barrand@lal.in2p3.fr</p><p>Good question&mdash;I don't have the answer. Perhaps, one of our
readers will know the legalities and let us know &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d69580.0x225b068"></a>OSDD Article</h2></div></div><p>I track operating environments for IDC and just read Phil
Hughes' article on the Open Source Developers Day (November 1998).
Just wanted to take a moment to echo your thoughts at the end of
the article regarding applications and Linux.</p><p>I often speak to my clients and vendors about Linux (or the
&ldquo;Linux Experience&rdquo; as I've taken to calling it; one has to have
some fun). I have been telling these clients and vendors that
applications drive OS sales. It really is that simple. Although
there are many barriers to Linux in enterprise, the recent
application development advancements/announcements are a positive
step for Linux. However, now is not the time to rest on these
victories. When I think about Linux &ldquo;standards&rdquo; and applications,
I believe that involvement from the beginning by the application
vendors is crucial.</p><p>&mdash;Bill Peterson wpeterson@idc.com</p></div></div>
