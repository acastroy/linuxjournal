<h1 class="title">ModSecurity and nginx</h1>

<h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">nginx is the web server that's replacing Apache in more and more of the
world's websites. Until now, nginx has not been able to benefit from the
security ModSecurity provides. Here's how to install ModSecurity
and get it working with nginx. By Elliot Cooper</h2>

<p>
Earlier this year the popular open-source web application firewall,
ModSecurity, released version 3 of its software. Version 3 is a
significant departure from the earlier versions, because it's now
modularized. Before version 3, ModSecurity worked only with the Apache
web server as a dependent module, so there was no way for other HTTP
applications to utilize ModSecurity. Now the core functionality of
ModSecurity, the HTTP filtering engine, exists as a standalone library,
libModSecurity, and it can be integrated into any other application via
a "connector". A connector is a small piece of code that allows any
application to access libModSecurity.
</p>

<p>
A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a type of firewall for HTTP
requests. A standard firewall inspects data packets as they arrive and
leave a network interface and compares the properties of the packets
against a list of rules. The rules dictate whether the firewall will
allow the packet to pass or get blocked.
</p>

<p>
ModSecurity performs the same task as a standard firewall, but instead of
looking at data packets, it inspects HTTP traffic as it arrives at the
server. When an HTTP request arrives at the server, it's first routed
through ModSecurity before it's routed on to the destination application,
such as Apache2 or nginx. ModSecurity compares the inbound HTTP request
against a list of rules. These rules define the form of a malicious or
harmful request, so if the incoming request matches a rule, ModSecurity
blocks the request from reaching the destination application where it
may cause harm.
</p>

<p>
The following example demonstrates how ModSecurity protects a WordPress
site. The following HTTP request is a non-malicious request for the
index.php file as it appears in Apache2's log files:

</p>
<pre><code>
GET /index.php HTTP/1.1
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
This request does not match any rules, so ModSecurity allows it onto the web server.
</p>

<p>
WordPress keeps much of its secret information, such as the database
password, in a file called wp-config.php, which is located in the same
directory as the index.php file. A careless system administrator may
leave this important file unprotected, which means a web server
like Apache or nginx happily will serve it. This is because they will
serve any file that is not protected by specific configuration. This
means that the following malicious request:

</p>
<pre><code>
GET /wp-config.php HTTP/1.1
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
will be served by Apache to whomever requests it.
</p>

<p>
This is where ModSecurity offers protection to an application accepting
HTTP data. In this case, the free, core ModSecurity ruleset contains
rules to deny any HTTP request that attempts to access any sensitive
file in a WordPress installation. The core ruleset also contains rules
for another popular CMS, Drupal.
</p>

<p>
The core ruleset also contains rules covering the many other ways
that HTTP requests can be constructed maliciously to gain access or
confidential information from a website. These methods include SQL
injection, vulnerability scanning, Java and PHP exploits and many
more. ModSecurity also supports custom rules, so you can protect your
HTTP application against specifically targeted attacks by writing your
own rules.
</p>

<p>
First let's install the core ModSecurity library,
libModSecurity, and then let's install the nginx connector that enables
nginx to use ModSecurity. Before version 3, it wasn't possible to
use ModSecurity with nginx. If you are using Apache2, you should continue
to use ModSecurity version 2, as the Apache2 connector is still quite
buggy and not recommended for production use.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Compiling and Installing libModSecurity</h3>

<p>
ModSecurity3 isn't available via the package manager for any of the
major Linux distributions. Instead, you'll need to clone the ModSecurity GitHub
repository and build the library from its source code. Before you can do
that though, you must install all of the required build tools and dependencies. The
following list of packages provides all of the required and most of
the optional discrepancies on Debian and Ubuntu distributions:
bison, flex, make, automake, gcc, pkg-config, libtool, doxygen, git, curl, zlib1g-dev, libxml2-dev, libpcre3-dev, build-essential, libyajl-dev, yajl-tools, liblmdb-dev, rdmacm-utils, libgeoip-dev, libcurl4-openssl-dev, liblua5.2-dev, libfuzzy-dev, openssl and libssl-dev.
</p>

<p>
Note that some of those packages have different names on Red Hat-based
distributions. This <a href="https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Compilation-recipes-for-v3.x">page</a> will help you figure out what the specific
package names are.
</p>

<p>
After installing those packages, you can move on to compiling the
library. These instructions are distribution-agnostic.
</p>

<p>
First, clone the libModSecurity git repository, which will download
all the source code you need to build the libModSecurity. Use
the /opt/ directory as the destination for all source code. Move to the
/opt/ directory, and clone the libModSecurity git repository with the
following commands:

</p>
<pre><code>
cd /opt/
git clone https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Next, move into the new directory that you created when you
cloned the ModSecurity repository, and switch to the v3 branch. You'll
also need to pull in a couple necessary sub-modules:

</p>
<pre><code>
cd ModSecurity
git checkout v3/master
git submodule init
git submodule update
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
You're now ready to build libModSecurity. This should be a familiar
process to anyone who has compiled a program from source code. You need
only the following three commands to compile and install the library:

</p>
<pre><code>
sh build.sh
./configure
make
make install
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
The <code>make</code> command takes a few minutes if you are running this on
a modest virtual server. The libModSecurity library now is installed
at /usr/local/modsecurity/lib/libmodsecurity.so. However, it can't do
anything until you install an application and connector that will redirect
the HTTP data to the libModSecurity library along with some rules. The next
section looks at installing the nginx connector and the core ruleset provided by the ModSecurity developers.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Compiling the nginx Connector</h3>

<p>
Let's compile the nginx connector by utilizing nginx's capability of
dynamic loading of third-party modules. nginx has been able to do this
since version 1.11.5. This version or one higher is not available from
the standard repositories of most of the major distributions. nginx
provides repositories for the current stable releases of Red Hat/CentOS,
Debian and Ubuntu that contain a version that supports dynamic module
loading. This <a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/install">page</a> lists these repositories along with information for adding the nginx repository to your
distribution. After you have added the nginx repository to your repository
configuration, you need to install nginx using your package manager. When
you have installed nginx, find the version you installed
with this command:

</p>
<pre><code>
nginx -v
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
When you have the version number, change to the /opt/ directory and download
the source code that matched your nginx version from this <a href="http://nginx.org/download">page</a>,
and unpack the archive that you downloaded.
</p>

<p>
Next, you need to clone the git repository for the ModSecurity nginx
connector. From the /opt/ directory, run the following command to clone
this repository:

</p>
<pre><code>
git clone https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity-nginx
</code>
</pre>


<p>
Now change into the new directory that you created when you unpacked
the nginx source archive. In that directory, run the following commands
to compile the connector:

</p>
<pre><code>
./configure --with-compat 
 ↪--add-dynamic-module=/opt/ModSecurity-nginx
make modules
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Now you need to copy the connector module into the nginx modules directory
with this command:

</p>
<pre><code>
cp objs/ngx_http_modsecurity_module.so /etc/nginx/modules/
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Now that you've compiled the nginx connector and copied it to the right
location, you need to configure nginx to use it. In addition, you also
need to download the rules that libModSecurity will use to filter the HTTP data.
</p>

<p>
First, move to the nginx configuration directory:

</p>
<pre><code>
cd /etc/nginx/
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
and add the following line to the nginx's main configuration file at
/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:

</p>
<pre><code>
load_module modules/ngx_http_modsecurity_module.so;
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
You need to put this line in the first section under the line that begins
<code>pid</code> and not in either the <code>events</code> or <code>http</code> sections.
</p>

<p>
Next, create a new directory and load the ModSecurity rules
and configuration into it:

</p>
<pre><code>
mkdir /etc/nginx/modsec
cd /etc/nginx/modsec
git clone https://github.com/SpiderLabs/
↪owasp-modsecurity-crs.git
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Use the ModSecurity rules configuration file that was downloaded
from the git repository by renaming it with the following command:

</p>
<pre><code>
mv /etc/nginx/modsec/owasp-modsecurity-crs/
↪crs-setup.conf.example /etc/nginx/modsec/
↪owasp-modsecurity-crs/crs-setup.conf
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Now you need to copy the ModSecurity configuration file from the directory
where you built libModSecurity to /etc/nginx/modsec/:

</p>
<pre><code>
cp /opt/ModSecurity/modsecurity.conf-recommended 
 ↪/etc/nginx/modsec/modsecurity.conf
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Finally, create a new configuration file that loads these two
configuration files and all the rules files. This file will be invoked
by a couple lines in an nginx server configuration block, which will
invoke the use of ModSecurity. Create and start editing this file with
a text editor:

</p>
<pre><code>
nano /etc/nginx/modsec/main.conf
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Add the following three lines to this file:

</p>
<pre><code>
Include /etc/nginx/modsec/modsecurity.conf
Include /etc/nginx/modsec/owasp-modsecurity-crs/crs-setup.conf
Include /etc/nginx/modsec/owasp-modsecurity-crs/rules/*.conf
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
You've now completed building and installing nginx,
libModSecurity, the nginx connector and ModSecurity rules. Now
you can start or re-start nginx to load the new configuration. If everything is
working, you won't see any errors printed when you restart nginx.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Testing ModSecurity</h3>

<p>
Let's test ModSecurity by adding a couple lines to the "default"
server and making a request that will be blocked by ModSecurity. The
default server configuration is the configuration that nginx uses on
installation and is listening only on localhost and not on the internet-facing network interface. This makes it secure to start nginx before
any custom server configuration has been created, because the default
configuration is inaccessible from the internet.
</p>

<p>
The default server configuration is located at
/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf. Open this file with a text editor, and
add the following two lines under the <code>server_name</code> line:

</p>
<pre><code>
modsecurity on;
modsecurity_rules_file /etc/nginx/modsec/main.conf;
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Restart nginx again to load this new configuration. Now, all you
need to do to test that ModSecurity is working is make an HTTP request
that matches a banned rule.
</p>

<p>
ModSecurity has two modes of operation. The default is that it will
only log any queries that match banned rules but allow them to pass
to the application. This mode allows system administrators to run
ModSecurity for a period and ensure that no false positive requests are
getting blocked that would interfere with the normal operation of the
website. ModSecurity records these requests that match banned rules
to /var/log/modsec_audit.log.
</p>

<p>
You can create an HTTP request that will be recorded to that log file by
using <code>curl</code> to make a request that contains a banned user agent header. The
following command makes an HTTP request that contains the header
"User-Agent: masscan". This is a banned user agent, so ModSecurity
records that it witnessed a banned HTTP request. This command looks like:

</p>
<pre><code>
curl -H "User-Agent: masscan" http://localhost/
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
nginx returns the default welcome page as raw HTML, but ModSecurity
creates a lengthy log entry in /var/log/modsec_audit.log that begins:

</p>
<pre><code>
ModSecurity: Warning. Matched "Operator `PmFromFile' 
 ↪with parameter `scanners-user-agents.data' against 
 &amp;rarrhkk;variable `REQUEST_HEADERS:User-Agent' (Value: `masscan' )
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
This indicates that ModSecurity successfully intercepted and matched
the malicious HTTP request.
</p>

<p>
When you want to toggle ModSecurity from logging malicious
HTTP requests to blocking them actively, edit the line in
/etc/nginx/modsec/modsecurity.conf from:

</p>
<pre><code>
SecRuleEngine DetectionOnly
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
to:

</p>
<pre><code>
SecRuleEngine On
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
and restart nginx. Now the same <code>curl</code> request will result in a 403 error:

</p>
<pre><code>
curl -H "User-Agent: masscan" http://localhost/
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;403 Forbidden&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body bgcolor="white"&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;403 Forbidden&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;center&gt;nginx/1.12.2&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
The blocked request also will be logged to /var/log/modsec_audit.log.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Additional ModSecurity Connectors</h3>

<p>
The new modular nature of ModSecurity means that any application that
accepts or processes HTTP data can use ModSecurity and its rules to
analyze HTTP data. At the time of this writing, ModSecurity v3 has been of release quality only for
a few months, so there aren't many additional connectors that enable
applications to hook into libModSecurity.
</p>

<p>
The Google Summer of Code has produced a couple interesting new
connectors. The first extends the ability of Snort v3 to use the
ModSecurity rules. Snort is an intrusion-detection and real-time
packet-sniffing and logging application. This connector allows Snort to
send captured HTTP data to libModSecurity and get it checked against
the ModSecurity ruleset. The home page for this project is <a href="https://akoul.github.io">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
A second Google-sponsored connector targets the node.js server. Node.js
is a JavaScript runtime that enables the creation of scalable
network applications. This connector routes all inbound HTTP
requests via ModSecurity, thereby adding a security layer to the Node
application. You can read more about this project at its <a href="https://m2n.me/gsoc">home page</a>.
</p>

<p>
The release of ModSecurity v3 has transformed ModSecurity from an
Apache module to a flexible application that is easily leveraged by
any application that accepts HTTP data. Given that more and more of the
applications that people depend on are moving from their local computers into
data centers, the need to ensure the security of those applications and
that data is becoming increasingly important.
