Lazy Fully Scripted—Linux from Scratch</h3>

<p>
I really enjoyed Petros Koutoupis' article on building your own distro (see
<a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/diy-build-custom-minimal-linux-distribution-source">"DIY:
Build a Custom Minimal Linux Distribution from Source"</a> from the June
2018 issue). I have not
had the time to build it yet, but I will.
Also I'm very interested in building Fedora SPINS, mostly minimal because with
adding PHP, NodeJS, Ruby, etc., it's very easy to eat up HDD space. I found a post from
Alagappan Karthikeyan from India on building his own distro in three hours,
based on Ubuntu.
</p>

<p>
But the video that impressed me the most was Tutorial:
Linux from Scratch by Anton, and he has four videos on time lapse and
successfully builds LFS. I got the book, but I never successfully did an
installation.
</p>

<p>
I remember in one of my RHCE classes the instructor mentioned that everybody
can copy/paste, and still it takes a good deal of time, but why not...so I put
together a set of shell scripts to accomplish this task:
<a href="https://github.com/dinooz/lfslfs/blob/master/lfslfs_get_started.sh">https://github.com/dinooz/lfslfs/blob/master/lfslfs_get_started.sh</a>.
Requirements:
</p>

<p>
1) The scripts will be executed in the same order they are listed.
</p>

<p>
2) VirtualBox→Xubuntu Live CD and HDD with 10GB HDD.
</p>

<p>
3) As xubuntu:

</p>
<pre><code>
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dinooz/lfslfs/
↪master/lfslfs_get_started.sh
chmod 755 lfslfs_get_started.sh
./lfslfs_get_started.sh
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
4) All the needed shell scripts will be right there at your fingertips,
executing one at a time, and will follow exactly as reading the online LFS.
</p>

<p>
5) Some scripts will be absolutely necessary to run as root and others as lfs,
and the generic as xubuntu for generic OS checks.
</p>

<p>
I have a video that illustrates the first part of the scripts installing the
temp system.
Some notes are required for the second part because bash breaks the shell
script, that's why I copy ... software2.sh to another script to continue the
execution.
</p>

<p>
I'm happy to say that I've learned a lot from this first part. I'm looking forward to
another script recipe for X, depending on the desired environment, and who
knows, maybe a package manager.
I just wanted to share this with you guys. Keep doing a great job.
</p>

<p>
—Dinooz
</p>

<p><strong>
Petros Koutoupis replies:</strong> Bernardino (Dinooz),
thank you very much for the encouraging words. Traditional LFS cookbooks are
written to build custom and more fully featured distributions (that is, with more
packages) on (and only for) your local machine. The recipes provided on the
official website are a wonderful source of information. Unfortunately, not
many individuals are able to operate in such an environment, which is why I
decided to take the cross-compilation route. The general theme behind the
cross-compiled and lightweight Linux distribution is centered around building
your minimal distribution for whatever architecture on your local machine and
in a sandboxed environment. Then take the final image and deploy it
anywhere—physical or virtual machine.
</p>

<p>
I do appreciate you bringing this GitHub project to my attention. For those
who wish to build a more fully featured Linux distribution from source, these
scripts definitely can help without the headache of running each command one
at a time (copied from the cookbook and pasted into the CLI). In the interim,
I have noted your suggestions. Since the publication of that guide, many have
requested a second part. I definitely can look into adding a graphical
environment and building a minimal X equipped with a basic window manager.
Package management may be a tricky one.
</p>

<p>
Thank you again!
</p>

PEP 572</h3>

<p>
Regarding Reuven M. Lerner's <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/python-and-its-community-enter-new-phase">"Python
and Its Community Enter a New Phase"</a> in
the August 2018 issue: I'm not a fan of Python primarily because of its significant whitespace
feature and the 2 vs. 3 incompatibility, although the significant whitespace
generally causes me more grief than does the 2 vs. 3 issues. But it's
incredibly useful because of the large collection of modules available, so I
find it invaluable for rapid prototyping.
</p>

<p>
From the perspective of a non-sophisticated user of Python, I can't see the
reason for all this controversy and animosity for a change that lets code like
this:

</p>
<pre><code>
x = 5

while x := x - 1:

    print(f"x is {x}")
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
now work, while still allowing code like this not to work as before:

</p>
<pre><code>
x = 5

while x = x - 1:

    print(f"x is {x}")
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
What am I missing that makes this a "big deal"? It's been a part of C
forever.
</p>

<p>
However, the print function in the example looks strange to me, so I tested it
in a Python 3.5.2 interactive session, and I got this:

</p>
<pre><code>
&gt;&gt;&gt; x=3
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(f"x is {x}")
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1
    print(f"x is {x}")
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
So is there a typo in the article? Or is it a Python 3.5.2 vs. newer version issue?
</p>

<p>
—wally
</p>

<p><strong>
Reuven M. Lerner replies:</strong> Yes, "f-strings", as they're known, were introduced
in Python 3.6. The leading "f" before the opening quote allows you to
evaluate anything within curly braces in a string. Thus:

</p>
<pre><code>
x = 5
y = 2
print(f"{x} + {y} = {x+y}")
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Before version 3.6, this would give you an error, as you saw.

Erratum: #geeklife Article in the August 2018 Issue</h3>

<p>
As a motor-home camper for the last 16 years, I was very interested in 
Kyle Rankin's <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/geeklife-weboost-4g-x-otr-review">"#geeklife:
weBoost 4G-X OTR Review"</a>. The problems are very familiar to those of us who spend extended
time far from civilization. I was very interested in the review of the
weBoost, although I assume the captions on the external antenna pictures were
interchanged.

<p>
Keep up the good work on <em>LJ</em>.

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Server Automation</h3>

<p>
Bravo for Adam McPartlan's <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/easy-ssh-automation">"Easy SSH
Automation"</a> tip in the August 2018 issue of <em>LJ</em>.
</p>

<p>
This is by far the clearest recipe for setting up passwordless login that I've
seen—a task I've done countless times, but each time with trepidation.
</p>

<p>
I'd love to see more server automation scripts from Adam and others.
</p>

<p>

<p>
<strong>Adam McPartlan replies:</strong> Thanks for the feedback. There is an excellent article
written by Kyle Rankin and published by <em>Linux Journal</em> regarding the use of the
ssh-agent, which is worth reading to help make things a little more secure for
you while maintaining a key exchange-based authentication:
<a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/secret-agent-man">"Secret Agent
Man"</a>.
</p>

<p>
Server automation is a big subject, and there are many great tools. Using the bash
script method is a good exercise. I have done work for companies that refused
to accept the new tools of the trade like Ansible, so it's nice to get a
good understanding of how you can achieve similar results. Most of my server
automation is derived from the script shared in the article. I have used it to
reboot servers, install and configure software, restart services, copy files,
query databases and pull reports.
</p>

<p>
I also recommend reading up on expect scripting. This can help with working on
many different network devices deploying new vlans, updating ntp settings and
adding radius servers. I'll be sure to share in due course.
