This is the time of year when the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> staff turns to you, our
readers, for insight on the best programs in the Linux world. I love this
time of year. No, not because you all do most of the work, but rather
because I get to see how my preferences compare to those of our readership. You get
to do the same. Whether you're looking for validation with your software
choices or hoping to fill a gap in your digital repertoire, this
issue should please.
</p><p>
Along with the Readers' Choice winners, we have an issue full of
&ldquo;choice&rdquo;
articles we've picked to go along with this month's theme. Reuven M. Lerner
shows us an easy way to scale Web applications with Amazon's Simple Queue
Service (SQS). Amazon makes scaling services simple, and Web applications
are no exception. Dave Taylor describes how to make a scale of our own for
rating Twitter accounts. Using scripting (Dave's specialty), extracting
data about a Twitter account is pretty simple. Come up with your own
formulas for what makes tweets terrific, and you can make a script that is
judge and jury all in one.
</p><p>
Our other command-line guru, Kyle Rankin, teaches us to laugh in the face of
E Ink and scoff at the Kindles of Amazon. In the same way Kyle chats with
Irssi, e-mails with Mutt and system-administers from an xterm, this month he shows how to
read <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> with his e-reader of choice: a terminal window. If you're
a minimalist like Kyle or just like to out-geek the person next to you,
you'll want to read Kyle's article. At the very least, it will make you
thankful for your digital e-reader!
</p><p>
Michael Nugent addresses a problem this month that is near and dear to me.
Every sysadmin should have a monitoring system, but what happens when that
monitoring system is more annoying than helpful? I get daily e-mail
messages from
several of my systems with reports on their success or failure. After
20&ndash;30
days of &ldquo;all normal&rdquo;, the messages tend to slip past my radar. Then one day
when they stop arriving, their absence goes unnoticed. The opposite can be
true though as well. How may times have you been woken up by your pager
beeping incessantly over a false positive? At 3 o'clock in the morning?
Michael discusses some best practices for making your monitoring system
effective at doing its job while not driving you insane in the process.
</p><p>
If you're a software developer, you will want to check out Daniel
Bartholomew's article on databases. Sure, databases aren't the most
exciting things in the world, but if you're a programmer, interfacing with
them is important. Add to that Joey Bernard's article on Mercurial for
revision control, and it's like soup for the programmer's soul. 
</p><p>
We realize not everyone is into programming though, and for you hardware
hackers, we have a couple exciting articles as well. James Tandon shows us
the open-source processor OpenRISC and teaches us some tricks for
utilizing it. As a community that historically has struggled with working with
proprietary hardware, the open-source hardware idea is very attractive.
Roderick W. Smith helps us stay ahead of the hardware transition game this
month too. He describes the new EFI boot mechanism that is
slowly taking over the role of BIOS in computers. Since hardware
manufacturers will be moving more and more toward EFI, it's important for
us to understand. After all, &ldquo;booting up&rdquo; is a pretty important part of any
operating system&mdash;even if it is only once every few years for Linux users.
</p><p>
Networking folks haven't been left out this month either. Paul Amaranth
shows us a pretty neat method of fixing broken NAT protocols using
NF_QUEUE. NAT works so well anymore, most of us take it for granted.
Sometimes it doesn't work as magically as we expect, however, and Paul
shows us how to do some magic of our own. Bill Childers and Kyle Rankin
close off the issue with a scary, but educational, story about wiping out their
data center&mdash;over and over. It's scary the damage we can do accidentally
when we work on production servers. Bill and Kyle are two people I turn to
when I have issues I can't solve, and as you'll read this month, they've
learned much of their knowledge at the school of hard knocks.
</p><p>
We'd like to thank you, our readers, for making this issue fun for us. It's
great to hear from you regarding what software and hardware you prefer. It
not only helps us produce a magazine that will fit your needs, it also
gives us a chance to learn from you. So sit back with your Kindle, prop up
an iPad or flip through digital pages with your Android. This month,
you get to see how you line up with other <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> readers. We hope
you enjoy.
