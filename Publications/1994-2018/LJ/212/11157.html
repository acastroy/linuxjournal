How you can use open-source hardware in your next embedded
system project.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b18580.0x1c10250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Linux has become a very mature operating system with support for a wide
variety of devices and processors. There have been several bumps on the
way though&mdash;a common problem for kernel developers is that manufacturers
sometimes want to keep hardware proprietary by releasing binary-only
device drivers. This issue has caused considerable consternation to both
the manufacturers and the Open Source Software community. Open-source hardware resulted partially from this friction. 
</p><p>
A sizeable community develops open hardware so that hobbyists and
professional FPGA and ASIC developers can implement advanced hardware
functions in their systems. The fruits of their labor have matured into
the OpenRISC soft processor core. The GNU C cross-compiler project team
for OpenRISC worked in tandem with the processor project team, and now
it runs our favorite operating system, Linux! My aim in this article
is to explain how embedded system engineers now use open hardware for
system design, and how Linux can run on an OpenRISC 1200 chip. The article
explores what people have done so far with OpenRISC, then introduces you
to several options for developing with Linux and OpenRISC yourself.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b18580.0x1c103b0"></a>
What Is Open-Source Hardware?</h2></div></div><p>
The principle behind open-source hardware is the same as with software,
except that they generally use different design languages. The common
languages used today for hardware are Verilog and VHDL. Just as you
can download the C language source code to Linux, you can download the
Verilog code to the OpenRISC 1200 processor. Do you want to implement
a multicore OpenRISC? No problem! You can instantiate as many cores as
you want. Do you want to implement a network processor? Just download
an Ethernet MAC core and connect it. Do you want hardware acceleration
for your MPEG codec in your embedded Linux system? You can implement
this in Verilog and access it directly from your processor with custom
processor instructions. This is the beauty of open hardware. You can mix
and match hardware components (commonly called cores) to create your own
unique processor. Sound, graphics, networking, robotic control&mdash;anything
is possible.
</p><p>
The tricky part is implementation. Very few people have a budget to pay
a chip foundry like IBM or TSMC to manufacture chips using the fanciest
chip technology. For a small manufacturing run, you can expect to pay tens
of thousands of dollars to build a test chip. Also, there is no guarantee
it will work the first time. Because of this, only companies with millions
of dollars, or government organizations, can afford it. However,
hobbyists are not left out completely. The field programmable gate array
(FPGA) is a special kind of chip that can run &ldquo;synthesized&rdquo; Verilog
code. This is very similar to running compiled C code. The penalty for
using an FPGA is that the circuit runs about two to three times slower
while using more power. However, you can purchase a prebuilt FPGA board
with an ethernet PHY, RS232, VGA or similar devices for as little as
$200. It is a much more reasonable way to implement complex hardware.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b18580.0x1c105c0"></a>
What Is the OpenRISC?</h2></div></div><p>
The OpenRISC architecture is a 32-bit instruction, 32-/64-bit data
processor. It is a specification that allows chip developers to implement
the processor so that it is optimized for high speed, reduced power
or minimized cost. It includes an optional cache and memory management
unit (MMU) as well, which makes porting Linux possible with only minimal
changes to the primary code base. Floating-point instructions also are
an option. The processor uses a special on-chip bus architecture called
Wishbone to connect to other on-chip devices like an Ethernet, VGA
or SDRAM controller. Also, because the processor is open-sourced, it is
possible for you to extend the processor with your own instructions and
registers. This is very useful for hardware acceleration. And, one key point
in its favor: OpenRISC is licensed under the Lesser GNU Public License
(LGLP), so it has very wide appeal.
</p><p>
The OpenRISC 1200 is an implementation of the OpenRISC architecture in
Verilog that is known as a &ldquo;soft core&rdquo;. Several soft-core processors
are available for chip designers to purchase today. One you may
know is the ARM architecture. Apple licensed an ARM soft core for
the iPhone, then customized the processor for implementation in mobile
applications. Nintendo used two separate ARM processors in the Nintendo
DS handheld video game system. The OpenRISC uses a very different
instruction set from ARM. However, many of the processing capabilities
are the same. If you want to use the ARM soft core for integrating your
project, you need the backing of a large company or research institution
to license the core. Time, money and red tape prevent individuals from
downloading and improving on proprietary cores, whereas OpenRISC is
freely available to anybody. You can download the source and simulate it
now in an open-source Verilog simulator like Icarus Verilog or Verilator.
</p><p>
An open-source processor is very beneficial to the community, but this
raises a question: what can it do? Rather than talk about possibilities,
let's look at a sample of what the community has accomplished so far
with the OpenRISC:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A full processor architecture specification with an extendible instruction
set.
</p></li><li><p>
Implementation in the Verilog HDL (OpenRISC 1200).
</p></li><li><p>
Simulation in Icarus Verilog, an open-source simulator.
</p></li><li><p>
VGA and PS2 keyboard interface implemented for usage like a traditional
desktop.
</p></li><li><p>
Verified OR1200 to run at 50MHz or better in FPGA.
</p></li><li><p>
ASIC implementation of OR1200 runs at 150MHz in 0.18um technology
(possible to run much faster in the latest 28nm technology).
</p></li><li><p>
Implemented as control processor for robotic control.
</p></li><li><p>
Full integration with Ethernet to implement an embedded Web server.
</p></li><li><p>
Play a digital music file.
</p></li><li><p>
Other devices that you can implement include USB, UART, I2C, SPI, SDRAM,
SD and many more.
</p></li><li><p>
GNU C Compiler 4.5.1 cross-compiler works.
</p></li><li><p>
Working implementations of both uClibc and newlib: two standard C library
implementations for embedded systems.
</p></li><li><p>
OpenRISC support included in the Linux 3.1 code base!
</p></li><li><p>
A software simulator so programmers can write software without purchasing
hardware.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If you decide to use the OpenRISC processor for your project, you
can proceed with the knowledge that your base system has been proven in
hardware multiple times.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b18580.0x1c11278"></a>
Getting Started with OpenRISC</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you know something about OpenRISC, you might be ready
to try downloading the soft core and associated development tools
yourself. Several smaller projects compose the OpenRISC Project that
you should look at:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
OpenRISC 1000/2000 specifications&mdash;provides a full listing of the
processor architecture and instruction opcodes.
</p></li><li><p>
Wishbone bus specification&mdash;standard interface for connecting devices to
OpenRISC.
</p></li><li><p>
OpenRISC 1200 processor source code (Verilog)&mdash;synthesizable soft core
implementation.
</p></li><li><p>
OrpSoc&mdash;synthesizeable embedded processor with Ethernet, SPI, SDRAM, VGA
and other peripherals.
</p></li><li><p>
OR1KSim&mdash;the software simulator for people developing software for
OpenRISC processors.
</p></li><li><p>
GNU C cross compiler for OpenRISC (version 4.5.1).
</p></li><li><p>
GNU binutils for OpenRISC (version 2.20.1).
</p></li><li><p>
uClibC for OpenRISC (version 0.9.0).
</p></li><li><p>
Linux for OpenRISC (version 2.6 modified or version 3.1 integrated).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The OpenRISC 1200 is a bare core that does not include any
peripherals&mdash;not even RAM. It is just a processor with a bare,
addressable bus interface. If you want a more-complete processor
with a bootloader and basic I/O interfaces, such as a serial port,
VGA controller or keyboard interface, you need to start with the more-complete ORPSoC package. You can check out the latest version of the
OpenRISC source tree using Subversion. Visit the
Web site <a href="http://opencores.org/or1k/Main_Page" target="_self">opencores.org/or1k/Main_Page</a> to get started. Follow
the links describing how to check out a copy of the OpenRISC repository
with Subversion. This will give the the latest version of the processor
with all relevant bug fixes. If you prefer to download tarballs, visit
<a href="http://opencores.org/download,or1k" target="_self">opencores.org/download,or1k</a> instead.
</p><p>
The OpenRISC trunk line does not include all the software, however. You
probably will want to download the latest versions of Linux and GCC that
are patched for OpenRISC as well. These are stored in git repositories
and no registration is required. Just follow the instructions at
<a href="http://www.openrisc.net/toolchain-build.html" target="_self">www.openrisc.net/toolchain-build.html</a> to get started. These
development versions may be unstable, so obtaining a release copy of
the Linux 3.1 kernel or later from <a href="ftp://ftp.kernel.org" target="_self">ftp.kernel.org</a> may be a
safer approach.
</p><p>
This will get you the latest versions of the OpenRISC software
development tools. With these packages, you now have everything you need
to perform software-only and hardware-software simulation on OpenRISC
with Linux. A lot of information is available for installing and
running these tools, but if compiling and simulating with these packages
seems intimidating, don't worry. All software is built using familiar
configure scripts and make files. For the hardware hackers, the Web site
<a href="http://www.opencores.org" target="_self">www.opencores.org</a> has a large community dedicated to OpenRISC
and a number of peripherals that can connect directly to it. Chances are,
if the extensive on-line help section does not answer your questions,
somebody in the forums will have encountered your problem
before. If you are more of a software person with a knack for programming
embedded systems, take a look at <a href="http://www.openrisc.net" target="_self">www.openrisc.net</a> and the
mailing lists listed there instead.

Experimenting with OpenRISC</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have the software and hardware source code, your designs are
limited only by your creativity. You can take three separate development
paths when developing with the current version
of OpenRISC: embedded software development, custom digital circuit
implementation in FPGA-based systems or creation of your own custom
processor (ASIC).
</p><p>
If you do not have the time or inclination to understand and develop an
FPGA or ASIC but want to develop software, you will want to use the
emulator, or1ksim. This high-level software emulator
allows you to test your programs for correctness without having to
purchase a prebuilt system. For instance, say you created a Web server
control panel, but you want to test it on OpenRISC. The simulator has
an Ethernet device option that your software can access and control. If
you wished to simulate a handheld game system, there is emulation
for general-purpose I/O (for push-buttons) and a VGA display. Here's another
possibility: you already have an open-source project, but would like to
test that it compiles and runs on OpenRISC/Linux. The simulator can help
you see if your software package compiles and runs properly. The project
is still young, so do not expect real-time 3-D rendering (yet). However,
if you want to test basic functionality of your open-source project to
OpenRISC, or1ksim is the way to go.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b18580.0x200a0d0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Programming Embedded Processors</b></p><p>
So, you are ready to bootstrap your embedded Linux system on a brand-new
OpenRISC implementation. How do you do this? With a cross compiler, of
course. The GNU C compiler project can generate binary executables for
32-bit i386 processors or x86-64 64-bit processors on your basic GNU/Linux
installation. However, if you want to develop for OpenRISC, you have to
recompile the GNU C compiler so it can target OpenRISC. This is a rather
involved process, which may require a special implementation of the standard
C library&mdash;this means you need to write code so that printf()and scanf()
know how to read and write characters! The instructions
at <a href="http://www.openrisc.net" target="_self">www.openrisc.net</a> are concise and quick. If you follow them, you can
get a full working copy of the GNU tool chain for OpenRISC very quickly.
</p><p>
If you want to understand how to build the OpenRISC toolchain from
scratch, or make modifications for your custom implementation, I recommend
reading <a href="http://www.openrisc.net/toolchain-build.html" target="_self">www.openrisc.net/toolchain-build.html</a> by Gene Sally. He
does an
excellent job of introducing the details of cross compilers.
</p></div><p>
The hardware hackers reading this article mostly will develop with
FPGAs. Altera and Xilinx produce excellent FPGA options for running
the OpenRISC processor. Both companies have embedded processor
cores; however, neither is open-sourced. If you develop for the Xilinx
Microblaze processor, for instance, you are locked in to using Xilinx
exclusively. OpenRISC gives you freedom to choose the best FPGA for
speed, power or area optimization. The fastest tested processor speed
I have observed in FPGA tests is 50MHz, although I suspect that the
fastest may go above 150MHz if the source Verilog and implementation
scripts are fine-tuned properly for one of the newest FPGAs like the
Stratix V or the Virtex-6. Altera claims that digital circuits can reach
550MHz on its latest FPGA architecture, although this is a best-case
scenario. The OpenRISC processor is fully capable of controlling a
robotic arm, and this application has been demonstrated (video at
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv1Gow7WZxM" target="_self">www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv1Gow7WZxM</a>).
</p><p>
The most extreme development path you might take is integrated circuit
(ASIC) development. This work tends to be left to professionals,
but open-source tools exist for layout and simulation of integrated
circuits. Compiling, also known as synthesizing, Verilog and VHDL to
a net list consisting of only simple logic gates is possible, though
very rudimentary without proprietary tools. Also, open-source tools for
placement and routing of logic gates in integrated circuits are virtually
nonexistent. The best place to look for source code that compiles a
net list, does place and route, or extracts parasitics is to search
the Web pages of university research projects. 
</p><p>
If you have the budget
for proprietary chip-design software (think millions of dollars USD),
tit is possible to design for the latest manufacturing process
available. Apple, Inc., has licensed the ARM processor and developed
the A6 processor in a 28nm technology node for the iPhone, and at the time
of this writing, it is currently in testing. OpenMoko and Android
are both Linux-based distributions for smartphones. A company
developing a smartphone processor that is targeted for use with
these distributions might consider using the OpenRISC target. General
chip design is beyond the scope of this article, but if you are really
interested, <a href="http://opencircuitdesign.com" target="_self">opencircuitdesign.com</a> or my personal Web site
<a href="http://www.jamestandon.com" target="_self">www.jamestandon.com</a> will get you started.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11157f1.large.jpg"><img src="11157f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Layout of an OpenRISC 1200 processor
in 0.18um technology implemented at the University of Tokyo. It has a
serial port, Ethernet, I2C, 128kB of on-chip memory and a custom serial
communication interface.
</p></div></div><p>
One group of people who have benefited tremendously from the OpenRISC
are university researchers who explore new technologies in digital and
mixed-signal development of integrated circuits. If a graduate student
needs to research how custom hardware interacts with software quickly,
it is possible to simulate and fabricate a processor without spending
years developing a processor core with a corresponding C compiler. A
researcher can test the system in FPGA, then submit a custom chip for
fabrication within six months.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b18580.0x200a860"></a>
The Future</h2></div></div><p>
OpenRISC has a large following in the integrated circuit research
community and the hardware hacker community. The OpenRISC/Linux
development team recently submitted their patch for inclusion in the
main Linux distribution. If all goes well, you will soon see the OpenRISC
build target when you download version 3.1 of the Linux kernel. Work on
the latest 3.1 OpenRISC kernel patch continues. If you feel inclined to
help, a lot of testing is needed for the latest development version.
</p><p>
Will it be possible to purchase an OpenRISC ASIC in the future? Quite
possibly. The team at <a href="http://opencores.org" target="_self">opencores.org</a> is soliciting donations for a custom
ASIC implementation. Hardware hackers who decide to commercialize
their FPGA projects may want a faster, lower-power version of OpenRISC
when selling their applications. Another possibility is that open-source
integrated circuit design will become available as well, making it
possible for small groups of people, or even individuals, without millions
of dollars, to submit custom chip designs to a manufacturer. The fabless
semiconductor company has become a much more viable business model in
the past 15 years.
</p><p>
The place where OpenRISC truly shines right now is in FPGA
design. Anybody can purchase a single FPGA for as little as a few dollars
or a prebuilt FPGA board for as little as $200 USD. This means that
anybody with a little extra cash can build a custom embedded system with
the OpenRISC. While processor cores that manufacturers provide confine you
to their architecture, the OpenRISC allows you to choose the best FPGA
for your project. Because Linux can run effectively on OpenRISC, you can
include any number of open-source projects on your custom hardware. If
