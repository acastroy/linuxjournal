Don't be afraid of using your chosen database's command-line client.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c98580.0x1d90250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I might as well say this up front: I don't like using GUI (aka
non-command-line or graphical) tools with my databases. This is likely
because when I first learned it was with command-line tools, but even so, I think
command-line database tools often are the best way to interact
with a database manually.
</p><p>
Two of the most popular databases in use on Linux are MySQL and
PostgreSQL. Each of them have very useful, if slightly different,
command-line clients. If you ever need to move between these two
databases, or if you're new to databases in general, a comparison of
the two is helpful.
</p><p>
But, because a two-horse race isn't as thrilling as a three-horse one,
I wanted to include a third database command-line client in my comparison. I
chose SQLite, because it is arguably the most popular database in the
world. You probably have several SQLite databases on your local computer
right now. The command-line client is nice too.
</p><p>
Also, I use MariaDB instead of MySQL in my examples, because that's
what I have installed, and because I like the improvements MariaDB includes
in both the command-line client and in the database server. MariaDB
and MySQL are very compatible, and my examples are simple, so whenever
I mention MariaDB, you can assume it applies to MySQL as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c98580.0x1d90460"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
To Serve...or Not</b></p><p>
PostgreSQL and MariaDB have what is known as a client/server
architecture. Clients connect to the server, and although client and
server often are installed together and you may think of them as a single
entity, they actually are not. The client does not need to be run on
the same machine as the server. The MariaDB server is called mysqld,
and it always is running while the server is up. Likewise, the PostgreSQL
server is called postgres.
</p><p>
SQLite does not have a client/server architecture. There is just the
database you are using, which is a local file, and client programs, which
can interact with it.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c98580.0x1d906c8"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
I won't go into how to install MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite3
here. Most distributions have packages for them, and in the case of
MariaDB, there are packages for Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat and a generic
Linux binary available from its download page. See the documentation
for each and your distribution's documentation for instructions.
</p><p>
On Ubuntu, you can install all three with the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install mariadb-server postgresql sqlite3
</pre>
</p><p>
Other Linux distributions are just as easy for the most part.
(You need to have added the appropriate MariaDB Ubuntu repository for
the above to work. Instructions are on the MariaDB downloads page.)

Basic Client Commands</h2></div></div><p>
The client programs for MariaDB, PostgreSQL and SQLite3 are mysql,
psql and sqlite3, respectively. I've listed several useful commands
for each client in Table 1. The first entry shows the basic command used to connect
to a database; however, each client has several options. These include
(in the case of MariaDB and PostgreSQL) options for specifying the user,
password and database host server. You will need these often, so refer
to the man pages for the clients for what they are and how to use them.
Some of the commands listed in Table 1 have extended options; refer to the
documentation for details.

The first time you connect to a newly installed MariaDB or PostgreSQL
database, you need to connect as the database superuser because
you likely have not set up any other users.
</p><p>
To launch a freshly installed MariaDB mysql client, do the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mysql -u root -p
</pre>
</p><p>
You will be prompted for the password you entered during the package
install process.
</p><p>
To launch a freshly installed PostgreSQL psql client, do the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo su - postgres
psql
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c98580.0x218aee8"></a>
Creating and Deleting a Database</h2></div></div><p>
Just installing database clients and/or servers does not automatically
give you a database to work with. For MariaDB and PostgreSQL, a database
can be created either with the client or with an external utility.
</p><p>
In MariaDB and PostgreSQL, to create a database called library, the
command is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE DATABASE library;
</pre>
</p><p>
To connect to this newly created database in MariaDB, do:

<pre     class="programlisting">
USE library
</pre>
</p><p>
In PostgreSQL, do:

<pre     class="programlisting">
\c library
</pre>
</p><p>
To delete the newly created library database, drop it with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
DROP DATABASE library;
</pre>
</p><p>
I shouldn't have to say this, but be careful with the above command. If
you just dropped the library database, create it again. You'll need
it later to follow along with the examples in this article.
</p><p>
In SQLite3, there is no database server, and databases are just regular
files, often with a .db extension. To create a database, name it on
the command line when you launch the client, and if it doesn't exist, the
client will create it, like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sqlite3 library.db
</pre>
</p><p>
To remove an SQLite3 database, just remove it like you would any other file
(with <tt  >rm</tt> or via your file manager).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c98580.0x218b4c0"></a>
Managing Users and Permissions</h2></div></div><p>
There isn't space to go into the details of how to create and manage the
permissions of database users here. Refer to the MariaDB and PostgreSQL
documentation for details. I will continue to use the default
superuser accounts for the examples here.
</p><p>
There is no internal database user or user permissions management with
SQLite3. If local users have write access to the database file, they
can do anything they want.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c98580.0x218b620"></a>
Common SQL Operations</h2></div></div><p>
This article is about the command-line clients for MariaDB, PostgreSQL
and SQLite, but one of the main things you do when using such clients
is write SQL statements. So let's look at some of the basic
SQL-related similarities and differences between the three.
</p><p>
The most common SQL statements are selects, inserts, updates and
deletes. As a computer language, SQL is one of the more popular ones, and
there is an official standard, ANSI SQL, which has gone through various
revisions through the years. Most relational database management systems
(RDBMSes) use SQL as their query language, but they differ in how closely
they adhere to ANSI SQL. Of the three I'm exploring here, PostgreSQL
sticks closest to the standard. MariaDB drifts from the standard in
places to make it easier to use. SQLite3 doesn't pretend to support
every feature of ANSI SQL. Instead, it supports only a subset. After all,
it's supposed to be &ldquo;Lite&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Some people would like to see SQL die and never be used again. I
am not one of those people. SQL has issues, but so do most computer
languages. I find SQL easy to read, flexible and well worth the time it
takes to learn it. The examples below are simple, and I gloss over a
lot of the complexity of SQL. I also don't explain every part of every
statement. My goal here is to give you a taste of what SQL looks like
in practice and to point out some of the similarities and differences
between the three databases. The on-line documentation for each of these
databases (and the in-client help for MariaDB and PostgreSQL) includes
extensive information on SQL syntax. I found the SQLite syntax diagrams
to be especially helpful for that database.
</p><p>
SQL statements can be written on a single line, or they can be broken up across
many lines to make it easier to read. In the examples below, I do the
latter. SQL statements usually end with a semicolon (;).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c98580.0x218b8e0"></a>
The CREATE TABLE Statement</h2></div></div><p>
You won't get very far in your database adventures without some
tables. If you're not familiar with databases, think of database tables
as spreadsheet sheets, without all the fonts and border styles.
</p><p>
Returning to our library example, the most common things in a library are books, so let's create a books
table:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE books (
  bookid serial PRIMARY KEY,
  title varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  seriesid integer,
  authorid integer
);
</pre>
</p><p>
The above works for both MariaDB and PostgreSQL, but it doesn't work for
SQLite3, because of the use of the SERIAL datatype, which often is used
as the datatype for a PRIMARY KEY. See the &ldquo;The SERIAL Datatype&rdquo; sidebar
for more information.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c98580.0x218bb48"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
The SERIAL Datatype</b></p><p>
A datatype is how you tell the database what type of data is in a
column. Common datatypes include integer, text, varchar and date. The
SERIAL datatype is a special one. In MariaDB, the SERIAL datatype is an
alias for the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT UNIQUE
</pre>
</p><p>
That's quite a mouthful, but it does the job of creating a
column suitable for use as a PRIMARY KEY. BIGINT is a large integer;
UNSIGNED means no negative values; NOT NULL means it can't be empty;
AUTO_INCREMENT means that if a specific value is not specified when a
row is inserted, the value should be &ldquo;the current highest value +
1&rdquo;; and UNIQUE means that no other row in that table is allowed to have
the same value in that column.
</p><p>
In PostgreSQL, the SERIAL datatype is an alias for this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT nextval('tablename_colname_seq')
</pre>
</p><p>
The strange <tt  >nextval('tablename_colname_seq')</tt> bit is referring to an
&ldquo;ALTER SEQUENCE&rdquo;, specifically:


<pre     class="programlisting">
ALTER SEQUENCE tablename_colname_seq OWNED BY tablename.colname;
</pre>
</p><p>
This is just PostgreSQL's way of creating an auto-incrementing
column. Thankfully, when you create a column with type SERIAL, PostgreSQL
creates the ALTER SEQUENCE for you. This column also is suitable for
use as a PRIMARY KEY.
</p></div><p>
A common feature of many database tables is a PRIMARY KEY. This key
uniquely refers to a single row of a table. The PRIMARY KEY can be a
combination of two or more columns in a row (as long as the combination is
guaranteed to be unique in that database table), but most commonly, there
is a specific, auto-incrementing column that is used as the PRIMARY KEY.
</p><p>
Every row in an SQLite3 table automatically has a PRIMARY KEY column
(SQLite calls it the RowID) created when you create the table. However,
it is hidden unless you specify a column with a type of <tt  >integer PRIMARY
KEY</tt>. So for SQLite, change the bookid line in the CREATE TABLE statement
above to this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bookid integer PRIMARY KEY,
</pre>
</p><p>
And, SQLite3 will create a table with equivalent settings to MariaDB
and PostgreSQL.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c98580.0x209cc98"></a>
The INSERT Statement</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have a table, it's time to enter (or INSERT) some
information. Inserting data between the three databases is very similar,
but there is one important difference. Both MariaDB and PostgreSQL allow
you to insert multiple rows of information in one statement. SQLite3,
on the other hand, lets you insert only a single row at a time.
</p><p>
For example, to insert some data into the books table you created
earlier, use this SQL statement for both MariaDB and PostgreSQL:

<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO books (title, seriesid, authorid) VALUES
  ('The Fellowship of the Ring', 1, 1),
  ('The Two Towers', 1, 1),
  ('The Return of the King', 1, 1),
  ('The Sum of All Men', 2, 2),
  ('Brotherhood of the Wolf', 2, 2),
  ('Wizardborn', 2, 2),
  ('The Hobbbit', NULL, 1);
</pre>
</p><p>
You may have noticed a typo in the last line. I did it on purpose so
you would have something to fix later.
</p><p>
For SQLite3, each row that you are inserting needs to be done separately,
like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO books (title, seriesid, authorid) VALUES
  ('The Fellowship of the Ring', 1, 1);
INSERT INTO books (title, seriesid, authorid) VALUES
  ('The Two Towers', 1, 1);
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c98580.0x209cf58"></a></h2></div></div><p>
...and so on.
</p><p>
In the SQL statements above, I don't specify the bookid in the column
names section. I do this because that column is set up as the PRIMARY
KEY, and it is filled automatically by the database with the correct value.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c98580.0x209d0b8"></a>
The SELECT Statement</h2></div></div><p>
SELECT is the most common database operation. The only reason I didn't talk about this
first is because until the table
was CREATE-ed and had data INSERT-ed into it, as you did in the previous
sections, there was nothing to SELECT.
</p><p>
On all three of the databases, SELECT statements work pretty much the
same. Basic SELECT statements, such as the following, will work on all three:


<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT * FROM books;
SELECT title, authorid FROM books WHERE authorid = 1;
SELECT * FROM books ORDER BY authorid;
</pre>
</p><p>
Joins also work very well across all three. Joins are where you combine
information from two or more tables together. For example, here is a join
that matches author names to their books based on the authorid number:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT title AS "Book Title", givenname, surname
  FROM books INNER JOIN authors USING (authorid)
ORDER BY surname;
</pre>
</p><p>
The above SELECT statement presupposes the creation of an authors table
and the insertion into it of at least a couple rows of data, like so:
</p><p>
On MariaDB and PostgreSQL:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE authors (
  authorid serial PRIMARY KEY,
  surname varchar(100),
  givenname varchar(100),
  birthdate date
);
</pre>
</p><p>
On SQLite3, change the authorid line to the following, and the CREATE TABLE statement will
work properly:

<pre     class="programlisting">
  authorid integer PRIMARY KEY,
</pre>
</p><p>
Here is some data for the table, formatted to work on all three:

<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO authors (surname, givenname) VALUES
  ('Tolkien', 'J.R.R.');
INSERT INTO authors (surname, givenname) VALUES
  ('Farland', 'David');
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, you can run the <tt  >SELECT ... JOIN</tt> statement.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c98580.0x209d690"></a>
The UPDATE Statement</h2></div></div><p>
Remember that typo? Well, it's time to fix it. This UPDATE line works
for all three:


<pre     class="programlisting">
UPDATE books SET title = 'The Hobbit' WHERE title = 'The Hobbbit';
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c98580.0x209d848"></a>
The DELETE Statement</h2></div></div><p>
Deleting rows also is the same across all three:

<pre     class="programlisting">
DELETE FROM books WHERE bookid = 7;
</pre>
</p><p>
The above will delete the row in the books table that has a bookid of 8. If
you've been following along, there should not be an entry with that
bookid, so nothing will happen.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c98580.0x209da00"></a>
The ALTER Statement</h2></div></div><p>
Suppose I decide to remove the seriesid column from the books table. In
MariaDB and PostgreSQL, the following statement will do it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ALTER TABLE books DROP seriesid;
</pre>
</p><p>
SQLite3, on the other hand, does not support the removal of columns
from tables. You can add columns to a table, or modify columns, but the
only way to remove a column is to create a new table without a seriesid
column, transfer the data from the old table to the new table, drop
the old table, and then rename the new table to the original name. It's
not as annoying as you might think, thanks to some SQL INSERT trickery
(well, I thought it was tricky the first time I saw it in action). The
basic idea is to use the output of a SELECT statement as the input to
an INSERT statement, like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE books2 (
  bookid integer PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  title varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  authorid integer
);
INSERT INTO books2 (bookid, title, authorid)
  SELECT bookid, title, authorid FROM books;
DROP TABLE books;
ALTER TABLE books2 RENAME TO books;
</pre>
</p><p>
The above trick also works as written in MariaDB and PostgreSQL as long
as you change the bookid line of the CREATE TABLE statement to the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bookid serial PRIMARY KEY,
</pre>
</p><p>
But, that's an awful lot of work if you just want to drop a column
from a table.
</p><p>
These examples should be enough SQL to give you a picture of how the three compare to
each other.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c98580.0x209dd70"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
SQLite Output</b></p><p>
When trying the SQL examples, you will notice the SQLite output is not
nearly as pretty as the output from MariaDB/MySQL or PostgreSQL. By
default, SQLite doesn't print column names or try to pad columns so that
they line up nice and fancy like the others do. To make SQLite do so for the
<tt  >SELECT ... JOIN</tt> statement, enter the the following commands before the
statement:

<pre     class="programlisting">
.explain ON
.mode column
.width 30 10 10
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >.explain</tt> command instructs SQLite to display column headers;
<tt  >.mode</tt> sets the output to display in columns, and the
<tt  >.width</tt> command
sets the width of the columns. The only issue with doing this is that it
will mess up the output of future queries (unless they happen to look
fine with the <tt  >.width</tt> values you specified). To reset things back to
the default, set the output mode back to the default &ldquo;list&rdquo; with <tt  >.mode
list</tt>. Doing this also turns off <tt  >explain</tt> and resets the column widths
back to their defaults.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c98580.0x209e2f0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Single vs. Double Quotes</b></p><p>
In the SQL examples I use single quotes (') for most things and double
quotes (") sparingly. MariaDB and SQLite allow you to use single or double
quotes interchangeably for most quoted text in queries. PostgreSQL is
pickier, because it tries to stay closer to the ANSI SQL standard, which
says single quotes should be used for values (for example: <tt  >title =
'The Hobbbit'</tt>), and double quotes should be used for system identifiers
(field names, table names and so on&mdash;for example: <tt  >SELECT title AS "Book
Title"...</tt>). You can force MariaDB to obey the standard&mdash;and reject
double-quoted values&mdash;with the command <tt  >SET sql_mode='ANSI_QUOTES'</tt>.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c98580.0x209e608"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
It is not hard to interact with databases on the command line. In my
opinion, doing the tasks listed above is much easier on the command line
than through a graphical database program.
</p><p>
Of course, manipulating your database by hand, whether on the command line
or with a graphical program, probably should be avoided in many cases
in favor of using an automated front end&mdash;for example, a PHP content
management front end for the database that contains the content for your
company Web site. However, for those times when you do need to dive in
and tweak something manually, or for small projects that don't justify
the time or expense of a custom front end, there is no need to be afraid
of using the command-line client of your chosen database.
