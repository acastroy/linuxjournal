Broken protocols can be fixed on the fly with Netfilter's ability
to direct packets to userspace programs.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x165c580.0x1754250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Recently, one of my clients was experiencing problems with remote
print servers. These print servers were on an internally NATted
network connected to a central records system located across the
state through the Internet. The print servers would not stay
connected, dropping the connection after a few minutes. 
Investigation finally tracked this problem down to the keep-alive
protocol used between the central system and the remote print servers. 
The keep-alive protocol employed a UDP packet with the source and
destination IP addresses contained within the data. Normally, this
would just mirror the addresses in the UDP header and would seem to be
redundant. In this case, the server ignored the UDP header addresses
and used only the internal addresses. When the packets went through
NAT translation, the internal addresses were sent through unchanged, and
the central server was attempting to reply to a nonroutable
10.xxx.xxx.xxx address.
</p><p>
Working with my client, we identified the problem and located
documentation that specifically stated the protocol would not work with
print servers behind NAT. For a number of reasons, my client was
unable to move the print servers to a non-NATted environment, which
left the problem of fixing the protocol.
</p><p>
Because all the keep-alive packets already were passing through the Linux
firewall, that seemed to be the logical place to fix them. The NF_QUEUE
facility in netfilter turned out to be the perfect solution.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x165c580.0x1754408"></a>
Netfilter and NF_QUEUE</h2></div></div><p>
Netfilter is part of the packet filtering framework within the Linux
2.4.x and 2.6.x kernels. As stated on the netfilter home page:
&ldquo;Netfilter provides a set of hooks inside the Linux kernel that allows
kernel modules to register callback functions with the network stack. 
A registered callback function is then called back for every packet that
traverses the respective hook within the network stack.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The NF_QUEUE facility extends this ability to userspace, allowing
packets to be directed using iptables rules to a userspace
program.
The program then can look at the packet and take action based on the
packet content. The program might decide to accept or reject the
packet, for example, allowing the firewall to filter packets based on
content. The program also might decide to modify the packet and return
it to netfilter for further processing. It is this latter ability that
allows broken protocols to be fixed on the fly.
</p><p>
The QUEUE facility initially was introduced into the 2.3 kernel and
allowed for a single queue. This was changed to NF_QUEUE in the 2.6.14
and later kernels to allow for multiple queues with a 16-bit queue
identifier, so it is possible to have up to 65,535 queues. If the
queue number is left off the iptables rule, it will default to queue 0 and
the behavior is equivalent to the older QUEUE behavior.
</p><p>
An important point to remember is this is a queue. The kernel queues up
packets for processing in userspace, and there is finite space to
buffer the packets. If it takes too long to process the packet, the
queue will fill up and packets will be lost.
</p><p>
Although my situation and this example use IPv4, the NFQUEUE facility
is also available in the IPv6 netfilter code and the ip6tables
command. The details of mangling the packet change to reflect the
protocol and headers that are involved, and there are slight differences
in the ip6tables chain traversal, but the overall process
remains substantially the same.
</p><p>
Because the packet processing takes place in userspace, you are not
limited to writing the program in C. You can use any language you want,
as long as there is a binding to the NF_QUEUE facility. At the time of this
writing,
in addition to C and C++, you can use Perl and Python to write your
packet handler (see Resources).
</p><p>
In my case, I chose to write my routines in C. Because the firewall in
question also serves as a gigabit router between two internal networks,
supports a VPN gateway as well as handling almost a thousand iptables
rules, I was interested in keeping overhead low. C was the natural
choice.
</p><p>
Before using NF_QUEUE, it must be enabled in the kernel. If your kernel
supports the config.gz option, you can use the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gzcat /proc/config.gz|grep -E "NETLINK|NFQUEUE"  
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x165c580.0x1754828"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and see if the configuration options listed below are set. If you do not
have gzcat, it's just a hard link to gzip; many distributions seem to leave
that out. 
</p><p>
If NF_QUEUE is not configured, you'll have to configure and rebuild the
kernel. The configuration parameters that you will need to set are the
following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CONFIG_NETFILTER_NETLINK=y
CONFIG_NETFILTER_NETLINK_QUEUE=y
CONFIG_NETFILTER_NETLINK_LOG=y
CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_NFQUEUE=y
</pre>
</p><p>
Use your favorite kernel configuration tool, rebuild, install and reboot.
</p><p>
If not present, you also need to build and install libnfnetlink and
libnetfilter_queue (see Resources).
</p><p>
Listing 1 shows the standard boilerplate code for an NF_QUEUE packet
handler. Steps 1&ndash;3 are basic setup. Step 4 creates a
specified queue and binds the program to it. The queue identifier must
match the queue number used in the iptables rules. This call also
registers the callback function, which is where the packet actually
is processed. Step 5 tells NF_QUEUE how much data is to be sent to the
userspace program. The choice is none, all or just the packet metadata
(information from NF_QUEUE, but no packet data).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x165c580.0x1754ae8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. NF_QUEUE Boilerplate Code in C</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

struct nfnl_handle *nh;
struct nfq_handle *h;
int ec, fd, rv;
char buf[1500];

// 1) Open library handle. For space reasons, the
//    error checking is not shown.

h = nfq_open();

// 2) Unbind existing nf_queue handler for AF_INET.
//    Ignore return code for 2.6.23 kernel.
//    See Resources for link.

ec = nfq_unbind_pf(h, AF_INET);

// 3) Bind the queue connection handle.

ec =  nfq_bind_pf(h, AF_INET);

// 4) Create queue, bind to queue 0 since that is
//    what the default QUEUE target in iptables
//    expects, specify callback function.

qh = nfq_create_queue(h, 0, &amp;nfqueue_cb, NULL);

// 5) Set the amount of data to be copied to
// userspace for each packet sent to the queue.

nfq_set_mode(qh, NFQNL_COPY_PACKET, 0xffff);

// Get the netlink handle associated with the queue
// connection handle.

nh = nfq_nfnlh(h);

// Get a file descriptor for the netlink handle.

fd = nfnl_fd(nh);

// Packet loop.

while ((rv = recv(fd, buf, sizeof(buf), 0)) &amp;&amp;
        rv &gt;= 0) {
  nfq_handle_packet(h, buf, rv);
  }

</pre></div><p>
This is pretty standard, except that under 2.6.23 kernels, step 2 will
return an error, which may be safely ignored. The packet is not
actually read using the recv() function; it is accessed by a callback
function invoked by the nfq_handle_packet() function. In addition to
the packet data, this allows access to additional NF_QUEUE metadata
and permits re-injection of the packet as well as ACCEPT and DROP
decisions to be made. The return code from the recv() call may be used
to determine if the queue has filled and packets are being dropped.
</p><p>
Before the program exits, it should close gracefully by unbinding the
queue with a call to nfq_destroy_queue(), followed by a call to
nfq_close(). In my implementation, I elected to include a signal
handler that closed any log files and unbound the queue on receipt of a
SIGINT or SIGHUP signal.

Packet Mangling</h2></div></div><p>
The callback function is where the real action is. Here you have
access to the entire packet, including headers and NF_QUEUE
metadata.
Listing 2 shows a simple callback routine that prints the source and
destination IP addresses and dumps the packet contents in hex.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x165c580.0x1754f08"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. Sample Callback Function That Will Dump a Packet in Hex</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

// Sample NF_QUEUE callback function.
static int nfqueue_cb(struct nfq_q_handle *qh,
                      struct nfgenmsg *nfmsg,
                      struct nfq_data *nfa,
                      void *data) {

    struct nfqnl_msg_packet_hdr *ph;
    int id = 0;
    int size = 0;
    int i;
    unsigned char *full_packet;
    unsigned char * c;
    struct in_addr ipa;
    char src_ip_str[20];
    char dst_ip_str[20];

ph = nfq_get_msg_packet_hdr(nfa);

if (ph) {

  // Print out metatdata.
  id = ntohl(ph-&gt;packet_id);
  fprintf(stdout,
        "hw_protocol = 0x%04x hook = %u id = %u\n",
         ntohs(ph-&gt;hw_protocol), ph-&gt;hook, id);

  // Retrieve packet payload.
  size = nfq_get_payload(nfa, &amp;full_packet);

  // Get IP addresses in char form.
  ip = (struct iphdr *) full_packet;
  ipa.s_addr=ip-&gt;saddr
  strcpy (src_ip_str, inet_ntoa(ipa));
  ipa.s_addr=ip-&gt;daddr;
  strcpy (dst_ip_str, inet_ntoa(ipa));

  fprintf(stdout,
         "Source IP: %s   Destination IP: %s\n",
          src_ip_str, dst_ip_str);

  // Print out packet in hex.
  c = (unsigned char *)payload;
  for (i=0; i&lt;size; ++i,++c) {
    fprintf (stdout, "%02x", (unsigned int)*c);
  }
  fprintf (stdout, "\n");

  // Done with packet, accept it.
  nfq_set_verdict(qh, id, NF_ACCEPT, 0, NULL);
  }
}

</pre></div><p>
When you have finished processing the packet, the routine must return 
a verdict using the nfq_set_verdict() function. This can be NF_ACCEPT
or NF_DROP (other verdicts are possible, but these two cover 99% of the
cases). If the packet is unchanged, a zero value length parameter
and null pointer can be returned. If the packet has changed, these
parameters should point to the new packet. In any case, a call to
nfq_set_verdict() must be made for every packet retrieved so the kernel
can remove the packet and associated information from its internal data
structures.
</p><p>
With access to the packet, combined with an understanding of the
protocol, you can mangle the packet to fix almost any conceivable
problem. In my case, I used a small lookup table to translate the
internal IP addresses to an external address on packets being sent to
the central system and the external IP address to the internal address
on packets being returned to the print server.
</p><p>
A very important point with packet mangling is that any change to the
packet contents will, almost certainly, change the packet checksum.
The IP header checksum will be unchanged unless you modify the source
or destination IP addresses. However, any change to the packet
contents will change the checksum for UDP or TCP packets. When the
kernel NATs the packet, it does not recompute the checksums. Instead,
it optimizes the process by modifying only the current checksums with
the difference between the old and new addresses. If the kernel does
not use NAT, the checksum is not even inspected. This means the
checksums must be correct when returning the packet to the kernel. 
Actually, with UDP packets, you can cheat by using a 0 checksum. The
UDP protocol specification states the checksum is optional, and a 0
value indicates that you have not calculated it. That is not a
recommended practice, particularly when traversing external networks,
but you can get away with it. With TCP packets, this is not an option;
the TCP header must contain a correct checksum. Any packet with an
incorrect checksum will be dropped by the next network device it hits.
</p><p>
There are a number of ways to determine if your checksum is correct. 
The easiest is to look at the packet using a sniffer like Wireshark
(Figure 1). Unlike tcpdump, which will print only the packet contents,
Wireshark will verify the packet checksums and even tell you what they
should be if not correct.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10939f1.large.jpg"><img src="10939f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Not only does Wireshark tell you the checksum is wrong, it also tells
you
what it should be.
</p></div></div><p>
The UDP checksum is fairly easy to calculate, although it does involve
constructing a pseudo-header containing the source IP, destination IP,
UDP data length and the UDP protocol number. I was in a hurry and
grabbed two different routines off the Net and found that both 
calculated incorrect checksums on a 64-bit platform. I finally had to
rewrite one of the routines to generate correct checksums (see
Resources for a download link). During development, you can use the 
checksum calculator URL in Resources to paste in a hex dump of your
packet to verify your results.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x165c580.0x17554e0"></a>
NF_QUEUE Hooks</h2></div></div><p>
When NF_QUEUE activates a callback, along with the requested data is a
parameter containing the hook that invoked it. The possible values of
the hook are defined in netfilter_ipv4.h as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING       0
NF_IP_LOCAL_IN          1
NF_IP_FORWARD           2
NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT         3
NF_IP_POST_ROUTING      4
</pre>
</p><p>
The value of the hook tells you which iptables chain was employed to
direct the packet to the callback. You can use different iptables
commands with different chains to change the behavior of your program by
checking the value of the hook parameter. You might direct packets from
your internal Net to the PREROUTING chain and packets from the external
Net to the POSTROUTING chain, for example.
</p><p>
Understanding how iptables behave is essential in picking the right
hook. The URL for faqs.org listed in Resources has one of the
clearest explanations I have found. Figure 2, adapted from this
reference, illustrates the packet path through iptables. The top label
in the ovals is the table name while the lower label identifies the
chain.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10939f2.large.jpg"><img src="10939f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Packet flow through iptables tables and chains.
Table names are in lowercase, chain names in uppercase.
</p></div></div><p>
In this case of mangling packets transiting the firewall, the LOCAL_IN
and LOCAL_OUT hooks will not be used (they apply only to packets
originating from or destined to the local host). That leaves three choices:
PRE_ROUTING, FORWARD or POST_ROUTING (note that older kernels had
more limited choices for the mangle table).
</p><p>
In this case where the IP header and actual source and destination
addresses are not changed, any of the three choices would work. This might
not be the case if you modify the source or destination addresses, which
might affect subsequent routing decisions. If the destination address
were changed to the local system, for example, you would be limited to
the PREROUTING chain. If you want to modify the packet after all
filtering has been done and intercept any locally generated packets as
well, you would use the POSTROUTING chain. The FORWARD chain is
useful for packets transiting the system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x165c580.0x1755958"></a>
iptables</h2></div></div><p>
At this point, you have a kernel with NF_QUEUE enabled, the nfqueue and
nfnetlink libraries are installed, you have a packet sniffer ready to go,
and your program is compiled and ready to test. How do you connect it
to iptables?
</p><p>
The iptables target QUEUE will send any matching packets to a program
that has registered itself for that queue, which defaults to Queue 0. An
optional <tt  >--queue-num</tt> parameter may be used to specify a nondefault
queue. It is also possible to use a <tt  >--queue-balance</tt> parameter with
recent kernels that specifies a range of queues. This allows multiple
instances of a userspace program on multicore architectures to improve
throughput. If no program has registered itself for the queue, the
QUEUE target is equivalent to DROP.
</p><p>
iptables has four built-in tables: filter, nat, mangle and raw. Each
table supports different chains (Figure 2). The filter table, which is
the default for the iptables command, is useful if your program is
making an accept or deny decision on the packet, thus allowing firewall
filtering based on content. The nat table is used for address
translation, and the raw table, a recent addition, is used only for
setting marks on packets that should not be handled by the conntrack
system. The table to use when altering packets is, as the name
implies, the mangle table. Listing 3 illustrates a few iptables commands
that will set up NF_QUEUE forwarding for UDP packets destined for port 1331.
In practice, this can become more complicated if you limit the source and
destination addresses using additional iptables commands or include other
selection criteria.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x165c580.0x1755bc0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

Testing</h2></div></div><p>
The NF_QUEUE application must run as root, at least when setting up the
queue. Otherwise, you will get a -1 return from the unbind or bind calls.
</p><p>
In my case, the print server generated a ready supply of keep-alive
packets, so I had no need of a packet generator. In the general case,
you will need some way of generating test packets to verify that your
system is operating correctly. A plethora of packet
generators are available. One example is PackETH, which is a GUI-based
packet generator that is quite easy to use, although still a little
unfinished.
</p><p>
Another necessary requirement is the ability to capture packets both
before and after processing to verify the output packet is
correct.
This can be easily done using tcpdump or Wireshark to view packets on
the input and output interfaces of the test system. Wireshark may be
used directly if you have X libraries available on the test system. In
my case, since I was running the packets through a production system, I
used tcpdump and then viewed the packet dump files offline with
Wireshark.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x165c580.0x1a60da0"></a>
Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>
The project turned out to be very successful. Fixing the keep-alive
packets as they traversed the firewall resolved the problem without
requiring any configuration changes on either endpoint. It was a
completely transparent solution and my client was very happy with the
result.
</p><p>
After being in place for a while, a crisis ensued when the remote system
IP was changed. The printers stopped, because the remote IP was
hard-configured into the print servers, and local personnel were unavailable to
reconfigure them. With the addition of a DNAT firewall rule and a tweak
to the protocol d&aelig;mon to fix the server address within the packet (all
done remotely), the printers came back on-line in time to run payroll.
</p><p>
TCP protocols also can be fixed using this approach. Because TCP is a
connection-oriented protocol rather than a datagram, the program will
need to keep some state information as it processes the data stream. 
This is a little more complicated than a UDP protocol, but not
unreasonable in practice.
</p><p>
I've posted a small sample NF_QUEUE packet sniffer on my Web site
containing complete build and execution directions. It's fairly basic,
but it allows you to get a hex dump of UDP or TCP streams determined by
iptables rules and can serve as a basic framework if you're building
an NF_QUEUE handler.
