Home Router Hacking</h4><p>
I thoroughly enjoyed Kyle Rankin's article &ldquo;Practice Hacking on Your Home
Router&rdquo; in the October 2011 issue. Usually system cracking gets a bit deep for
me, but this example was both practical and easy to follow&mdash;nice! One
minor nit: data encoded into a URL is actually GET data rather than POST
data. (I'll give him a pass this time on &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; vs.
&ldquo;cracking&rdquo;.)

<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle Rankin replies:</b></span> Hey, precision is
important, so thanks for the nitpick!
You are right. The way
I was submitting data to the router was GET data. GET or POST, the lesson
is that if you accept input, sanitize it. If you are curious about why I
use &ldquo;hacker&rdquo;, I explain it in detail in my November 2010
column &ldquo;Some Hacks
from DEF CON&rdquo;.

Return to Solid State</h4><p>
I enjoyed getting a little comparative data on SSD performance [see Kyle
Rankin's &ldquo;Return to Solid State&rdquo; review in the October 2011
issue]. My own
experience is with an under-powered Acer Aspire One Netbook. One note, to
further improve disk IO time and SSD wear, I load all partitions with
noatime and nodiratime options in fstab.

<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle Rankin replies:</b></span>
Thanks for the feedback&mdash;a good point about atime. I can understand that it
makes sense to disable atime completely on some filesystems for speed
(such as mountpoints dedicated to database storage), but for me, I find
such benefit in atime for forensics that if speed is a concern, I like to
use the new relatime option in the fstab. That way, I still get atime;
however, atime writes are cached so it gives much better performance.

The Digital Subscription</h4><p>
I want to thank you for converting to all-digital download for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>. I see that in the past the magazine kept shrinking slowly over
time, and now that you have gone 100% digital, it has grown in size! I think
that is a plus for you. At first, I was worried about whether I would like the
digital version, but after two months, I find I have begun to like it. Keep
up the good work and the great articles!

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Jim Brown  <br><br>
</p><p>
You bring up a point I hadn't even considered in regards to the
&ldquo;thickness&rdquo;
of the magazine. We can be a little more flexible now than we could
be with paper. Thanks for the kudos as well. In all the chaos involved with
the digital transition, the one thing we wanted to maintain was
content.&mdash;Ed.

Digital Format Surprise</h4><p>
I'm a longtime reader, first time feedbacker. I just finished reading my first
digital copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, and although I thought I would hate the
experience compared to reading in dead-tree format, I was pleasantly
surprised. I spend all day staring at LCD pixels, and I rather disliked the
idea of including my casual reading here. With the paper version of the
journal, I often would read about something cool and say to myself, &ldquo;Neat
project I should check this out next time I sit and my computer.&rdquo; Only I
would never remember to remember to check it out. I love the HTML links
built in to the digital version of the journal. It is so much more of an
interactive experience. And that got me thinking, take one more step by
creating a wiki-like version of the journal with user comments that show up
next to articles, videos and so on&mdash;just a thought.
Keep up the good work.

<br><br>&mdash;<br>

Cool idea Dan. As we learn to do this whole digital thing better and better
every month, it will make new ideas feasible. Now that the entire
production process is in-house (no more sending off to the printer), it
makes experiments much easier as well. I totally agree regarding
hyperlinks too. In the past, I've done my best to include short URLs in
printed articles, but now we can use the real links and not worry about
someone typing them in by hand. My favorite thing about digital though?
Searching.&mdash;Ed.

epub</h4><p>
I tried out the epub version of the September <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> on my Nook
Color and enjoyed reading it on that device&mdash;until I came to the
graphics. It seems that images, such as a Bash screen in an article,
are too small on the Nook to be read. They don't magnify either. I
tried turning the Nook on its side for landscape view, which it will do
with books and Web pages, but the pages wouldn't landscape. Yuck!
</p><p>
So, please study the epub version for a way to fix landscape or
magnify images (perhaps embed a clickable bigger picture). Perhaps
the problem is really with the Nook and epubs. In general, the
Nook has problems with PDFs also. Usually they will magnify, but the
landscape mode tends to be busted or useless with it still in a smaller
portrait mode while turned 90 degrees.
</p><p>
I guess for now I won't be able to read <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> on my Nook with much
success. I'll read it on my computer instead.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Dave   <br><br>
</p><p>
You are absolutely correct. Although we've been doing magazine layout
forever, this whole &ldquo;flowing text&rdquo; thing is new for us. Trying to make
epub files that work well on all devices is really challenging. We are
working hard every month to make the experience a little better, and I
think we've succeeded a little bit each month. Another challenge is example
code. Because devices are so varied in size, it's rough to make
the code &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; on each reader.
</p><p>
Like I said, we're working on honing our skills, so you should see
improvement every month. Sending in comments like this
<span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> helps us
determine what to focus on, so thank you again!&mdash;Ed.

Please Write about epub Tools</h4><p>
This month, I received <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> in pure electronic form. I got it in PDF
and mobi formats, and I can read it directly on my Kindle. I realized that since
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> decided to deliver its content in e-formats, may be it can write
about it. For instance, do an overview of available software tools, techniques for
text formatting (especially code formatting suitable for gadgets), tools for
transforming from one format to another and so on. I think it would be great topic
for readers.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Valentin   <br><br>
</p><p>
I agree! I want to see some articles on epub creation myself, so hopefully
we can find some experts on the topic. I know there are many conversion
tools out there, but what I'm looking for (and I think you're looking for)
are tools to create them or edit them. The epub format offers so many cool
features like table of contents, chaptering, graphic placement and so on,
and I want
to learn how to make or tweak my own. Thanks for sharing my
interest.&mdash;Ed.
