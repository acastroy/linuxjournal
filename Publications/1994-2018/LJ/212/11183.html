It's not easy to determine whether someone's worth following on
Twitter, but Dave takes on the task with a shell script that extracts
account stats for a given Twitter account, then calculates their follow
value. He also explains the philosophy behind the project and
finds that Twitter has some weirdnesses in its HTML that makes parsing the
results interesting.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcab580.0xda3358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
So, you've been using Twitter since it was all about the fail whale and
not about the corporate sponsorships and back-end analytics. Me too. The problem
is, Twitter also has become even more crazy and hard to understand as
it has gained its millions of followers and its utility ecosystem has
expanded and contracted variously. 
</p><p>
One thing that's always interested me though, is whether there's a
way to calculate a numeric value for given Twitter users based on both
their visibility and engagement. How do you measure those? Visibility could
be calculated simply by looking at how many followers someone has, but most
Twitter users follow lots of random people, so that they can have lots of
followers. 
</p><p>
This behavior is based on what Dr Robert Cialdini calls the Principle of
Reciprocity in his brilliant book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Influence</em></span>, wherein he observes
that if someone does something for you, you feel an inherent obligation to
return the favor. Think Hare Krishnas at the airport giving you a flower
before they ask for a donation. Think of the self-appointed pundits and
gurus telling you their rules of netiquette, or of your own reactions&mdash;&ldquo;if
this person's following me on Twitter, I should follow them back.
It's only polite, after all.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The upside is that if you just look at how many followers someone
has without also checking how many people they follow, you can be duped into
thinking something along the lines of &ldquo;25,000 followers?
Impressive.&rdquo; without ever noticing that the person follows 30,000 people in
turn. 
</p><p>
One way to differentiate these different types of Twitter users, therefore,
is to calculate the ratio of followers to following. That's half the
calculation. 
</p><p>
Engagement is trickier to calculate, but if you examine someone's Twitter
stream, you can separate out broadcast messages from those that are either
an at-reply (as in &ldquo;@DaveTaylor nice column!&rdquo;) or a retweet.
</p><p>
It's another ratio. If the majority of tweets from someone are broadcast
tweets, their level of engagement is low, whereas a Twitter user whose
messages almost always are responses is high on the engagement
scale.
</p><p>
One more criterion: gross numbers. How many followers does someone have overall?
How many tweets has the user sent? An account with a high engagement but only
seven
tweets in the last six months is less interesting than one with lower
engagement but an average of 20 tweets a day. 
Agreed? 
</p><p>
So, how do we calculate these sort of figures? 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcab580.0xda3930"></a>
Understanding a Twitter Profile Page</h2></div></div><p>
Twitter offers up quite a bit of information for its public profiles (and
just about every Twitter profile is public), including the key stats we
want to start with: follower count and following count. 
</p><p>
To get them, we don't even need to negotiate the OAUTH login. We can just
use curl from the command line: 


<pre     class="programlisting">

$ curl -s http://twitter.com/davetaylor |
    grep 'stats_count numeric'
  &lt;span id="following_count" class="stats_count numeric"&gt;566 &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span id="follower_count" class="stats_count numeric"&gt;10,187 &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span id="lists_count" class="stats_count numeric"&gt;790 &lt;/span&gt; 

</pre>
</p><p>
You can see that my Twitter account, @DaveTaylor, has 10,187 followers,
while I'm following 566 people. The &ldquo;list&rdquo; figure suggests
popularity too, but since most Twitter users I know eschew lists, let's
just ignore that for now. 
</p><p>
We'd also like to grab the raw tweet count to see if it's an account
that actually has sent some tweets or is dormant. Examining the HTML
closely reveals that although the previous items are put into the class
<tt  >stats_count</tt>, the number of tweets sent is put in a similar, but
not quite identical, class called <tt  >stat_count</tt>. Typo? Maybe.
Meanwhile, it forces us to tweak our regular expression: 


<pre     class="programlisting">

$ curl -s http://twitter.com/davetaylor |
  grep -E '(stats_count|stat_count)'
  &lt;span id="following_count" class="stats_count numeric"&gt;566 &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span id="follower_count" class="stats_count numeric"&gt;10,187 &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span id="lists_count" class="stats_count numeric"&gt;790 &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;li id="profile_tab"&gt;&lt;a href="/DaveTaylor" accesskey="u"&gt;
  &lt;span id="update_count" class="stat_count"&gt;30,055&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Tweets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 

</pre>
</p><p>
It's a bit ugly, but it's not much work to extract and reformat the data in a
script. The challenge really is just to strip away all the HTML junk,
because once
we've used it to select the lines in question, we don't actually
need it any more.
</p><p>
My first attempt is this: 

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ echo "&lt;test me&gt;hello&lt;test 2&gt;" | sed 's/&lt;.*&gt;/-/g'
- 

</pre>
</p><p>
That didn't work. We want &ldquo;hello&rdquo; as the result, because we
don't want to lose the non-HTML values. Here's my second try: 

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ echo "&lt;test me&gt;hello&lt;test 2&gt;" | sed 's/&lt;[^&gt;]*&gt;/-/'
-hello&lt;test 2&gt; 

</pre>
</p><p>
Aha! That's what we need&mdash;a regular expression that basically says
&ldquo;&lt; followed by as many characters as are present other than the
'&gt;' character&rdquo;.
</p><p>
To strip all the HTML, simply make it a global search and replace by
appending a &ldquo;g&rdquo; to the sed statement: 

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ echo "&lt;test me&gt;hello&lt;test 2&gt;" | sed 's/&lt;[^&gt;]*&gt;/-/g'
hello 

</pre>
</p><p>
That's great. Now we can turn the mess of results into something
hopefully a bit more useful: 


<pre     class="programlisting">
curl -s http://twitter.com/davetaylor | grep -E 
 &#8618;'(stats_count|stat_count)' | sed 's/&lt;[^&gt;]*&gt;/ /g'
   566 
   10,187 
   790 
       30,055  Tweets 
</pre>
</p><p>
We still need to get rid of those pesky commas, but that's a small addition
to the sed statement, right? Let's use this instead: <tt  >sed
's/&lt;[^&gt;]*&gt;/ /g;s/,//g'</tt>.
</p><p>
The results are ready to be parsed: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
566 
10187 
790 
    30055  Tweets   
</pre>
</p><p>
That can be done with one of my favorite scripting commands,
<tt  >cut</tt>. The wrinkle, however, is that when we drop this into a shell
script, the results are a bit surprising if we look at my @FilmBuzz movie
news Twitter profile. First, the script snippet: 


<pre     class="programlisting">
stats="$(curl -s $twitterurl/$username | grep -E 
 &#8618;'(stats_count|stat_count)' | sed 's/&lt;[^&gt;]*&gt;/ /g;s/,//g')" 
echo $stats 
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcab580.0xda4590"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And, the results: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./tstats.sh filmbuzz

#side .stats a:hover span.stats_count 
 &#8618;#side .stats a span.stats_count 1701
4529 303 13034 Tweets 
</pre>
</p><p>
Although this just impacts the field number of the <tt  >cut</tt> command, it
turns out to be more tricky than it first seems. I run the same tstats
script against @DaveTaylor and look what happens: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./tstats.sh davetaylor
566 10187 790 30055 Tweets 
</pre>
</p><p>
Different output. Jeez&mdash;there's always something. 
</p><p>
Let's stop here with this small dilemma, and next month we'll pick up
the parsing challenge and then proceed to calculating some numeric scores
for Twitter users. Stay tuned!
