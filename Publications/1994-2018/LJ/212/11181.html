We have to die. Code doesn't.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbd2580.0xcca300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I'm writing this the day after Steve Jobs died, and the man's famous
&ldquo;reality distortion field&rdquo; has surely survived him. It will be months or
years before anybody can get a good-enough handle on what the guy did, and
meant. Meanwhile his death looms, larger than life. As it should, because
death and life both matter, and both need each other.
</p><p>
Life, far as we can tell, exists only on the surface of one planet of one
star among a hundred billion in our galaxy, which is one of a hundred
billion other galaxies. The chance of life happening elsewhere exceeds
zero, but not the chance of finding out for sure in our lifetimes. Our
deathtimes are another matter. We are all dead for most of eternity.
</p><p>
But if life exists elsewhere, it depends on death no less than does our
own. That's because death is more than the end or the absence of life. It
is a condition required by life. The living eat the dead. The living also
heat, forge, manufacture, build and destroy with the dead. Except for wind,
water, sun and radioactive elements, we produce all our electricity with
products and by-products of death. Oil, coal, wood and gas come straight
from death. So do asphalt, concrete, plastics and all natural and
artificial fabrics. Without death, we would not have handy forms of geology
known only on Earth: limestone, marble, travertine, chert, diatomite. None
of the world's most beautiful caves would have formed, and there would be
no stalactites or stalagmites. Without death, no great pyramids, no Notre
Dame, no Pantheon, no Parthenon.
</p><p>
Death uses us to make more of itself. It wants us
out of the way. Sooner or
later, we are obliged to cease living, and to burn or flush our remains
into death's system. Steve Jobs knew that, years before he departed. Here's
what he said in a commencement address to graduating students at Stanford
in 2005:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die
to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has
ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely
the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out
the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not
too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away.
Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.
</p><p>
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't
be trapped by dogma&mdash;which is living with the results of other
people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your
own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart
and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become.
Everything else is secondary.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
As I write this, much is being said about how the tech world will miss
Steve's creative muse, his leadership, his taste and the rest of it. Which
it will. But &ldquo;what would Steve do&rdquo; is exactly kind of dogma trap the man
warned us about. So is being like Steve, or like anybody other than
ourselves.
</p><p>
Like lots of other people, I appreciated a lot of what Steve Jobs created,
even as his control freakiness also drove me nuts. But he did what only he
could do, and now he's gone. His shadow remains long. Yet we have to step
out of it.
</p><p>
Most of us in the Linux community have long made a point of working as far
as possible outside of Steve Jobs' shadow, as well as those of Bill Gates
and other industrial giants of the computing and networking
worlds. What
I'm wondering, now that Steve's dead and Bill has left the building, is
what more we can do with Linux, free software and open source, than we
would if they were still around.
</p><p>
There are huge opportunities, especially with mobile devices. It's been fun
to see Samsung rolling out kernel code
(<a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2011/09/21/att-samsung-galaxy-s-ii-kernel-source-code-released" target="_self">www.androidpolice.com/2011/09/21/att-samsung-galaxy-s-ii-kernel-source-code-released</a>) for its Android devices, even as
Google closes doors on Android 3.0 &ldquo;Honeycomb&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/google/google-android-30-honeycomb-open-source-no-more/2845" target="_self">www.zdnet.com/blog/google/google-android-30-honeycomb-open-source-no-more/2845</a>). I even take heart in the
weirdness of Nokia once again moving toward Linux, this time for its
low-end phones, though something called Meltremi
(<a href="http://thenextweb.com/mobile/2011/09/29/nokias-meltemi-project-tipped-to-bring-new-low-end-linux-os-to-the-next-billion" target="_self">thenextweb.com/mobile/2011/09/29/nokias-meltemi-project-tipped-to-bring-new-low-end-linux-os-to-the-next-billion</a>). (What was wrong with
Maemo?)
</p><p>
But a strength of Linux has always been its non-corporate nature. Android
might belong to Google, but Linux doesn't belong anybody. Linux's sole
purpose is to be useful. What makes us keep improving it is a deeply felt
need to maximize that usefulness. That usefulness outlives us, but not
because it's dead.
</p><p>
See, free and open code is a kind of living building material. It's like
wood that's still quick. And nothing needs to die for it to keep improving.
It's a product of life that lives to support more life. All it needs is to
be used, patched and re-used. As creators, the roles are reversed: code's
gods are mortal, but code doesn't have to be.
