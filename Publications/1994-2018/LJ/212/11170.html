Sometimes events and equipment conspire against you and your team to cause
a problem. Occasionally, however, it's lack of understanding or foresight
that can turn around and bite you. Unfortunately, this is a tale of where
we failed to spot all the possible things that might go wrong.

Flashback...</h2></div></div><p>
It was 2006, and we were just getting our feet wet with piloting a new
server architecture for our company. We'd just received our first fully
populated Hewlett-Packard blade chassis (a P-Class chassis with eight dual-core
blades, for those of you who're savvy with that type of gear), a new EMC
Storage Area Network (SAN) and three VMware ESX licenses. We had just
finished converting a fair amount of the development network over to the
VMware environment using a Physical-to-Virtual (P2V) migration, and things
were going quite well. Matter of fact, many of the people in the company
didn't quite understand exactly the improvements we were making to the
systems, but they did notice the performance boost of going from machines
that were something like single-processor Pentium 4-class servers with IDE
disks to a dual-core Opteron where the storage was backed by the speed of
the Fibre Channel SAN. In all, things were going quite well, and the
feedback we'd received to date fueled a rather rapid switch from the aging
physical architecture to a much faster virtual machine architecture.

Background</h2></div></div><p>
Before we dive into the story, a couple bits of background
information will become very important later on. As I said, we'd
received eight dual-core blades, but only three of them at that time were set aside
for VMware hosts. The rest were slated to become powerful physical
machines&mdash;Oracle servers and the like. All these new blades were configured
identically: they each had 16GB of RAM, two dual-core Opteron processors,
two 300GB disks and Fibre Channel cards connected to the shiny new EMC
SAN. With respect to the SAN, since we were devoting this SAN strictly to
the blade servers, the decision was made not to add the complexity of
zoning the SAN switch. (Zoning a SAN switch means that it is set up to allow
only certain hosts to access certain disks.) The last tidbit relates to
kickstart. 
</p><p>
Both Kyle and I have written a few articles on the topic of
kickstarting and automated installation, so by now you're probably aware
that we're fans of that. However, this was 2006, and we both were getting
our feet wet with that technology. We'd inherited a half-set-up kickstart
server from the previous IT administration, and we slowly were making
adjustments to it as we grew more knowledgeable about the tech and what we
wanted it to do.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>[Kyle: Yes, the kickstart environment technically worked, but it required that
you physically walk up to each machine with a Red Hat install CD, boot from
it, and manually type in the full HTTP path to the kickstart file. I liked
the idea of kicking a machine without getting up from our desks, so the
environment quickly changed to PXE booting among a number of other
improvements. That was convenient, because those blades didn't have a CD-ROM
drive.]</em></span>
</p><p>
Getting back to the story...we'd moved a fair amount of the development
and corporate infrastructure over to the VMware environment, but we still
had a demand for high-powered physical machines. We'd gotten a request for
a new Oracle database machine, and since they were the most powerful boxes
in the company at the time, with connections to the Storage Area Network,
we elected to make one of the new blades an Oracle box. 
</p><p>
As my imperfect memory recalls, Kyle fired up the lights-out management
on what was to be the new Oracle machine and started the kickstart
process, while I was doing something else&mdash;it could have been anything
from surfing Slashdot to filling out some stupid management paperwork. I
don't remember, and it's not critical to the story, as about 20 minutes
after Kyle kickstarted the new Oracle blade, both of our BlackBerries started
beeping incessantly.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>[Kyle: Those of you who worked (or lived) with us during that period might
say, &ldquo;Weren't your BlackBerries <span class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span> beeping
incessantly?&rdquo; Yes, that's true, but this time it was different: one, we
were awake, and two, we actually were in the office.]</em></span>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x211e580.0x2216c48"></a>
Trouble in Paradise</h2></div></div><p>
We both looked at our BlackBerries as we started getting &ldquo;host
down&rdquo; alerts
from most of the machines in the development environment. About that time,
muttering could be heard from other cubicles, too: &ldquo;Is the network down?
Hey, I can't get anywhere.&rdquo; I started getting that sinking feeling in the
pit of my stomach as Kyle and I started digging into the issue.
</p><p>
Sure enough, as we started looking, we realized just about everything was down.
Kyle fired up the VMware console and tried restarting a couple virtual
machines, but his efforts were met with &ldquo;file not found&rdquo; errors from the
console upon restart. File not found? That sinking feeling just accelerated
into free-fall. I started looking along with Kyle and realized that all the
LUNs (disks where the virtual machines reside) just flat out stopped being
available to each VM host. 
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>[Kyle: It's hard to describe the sinking feeling. I was relatively new to
SAN at the time and was just realizing how broad a subject it is in its own
right. SAN troubleshooting at a deep level was not something I felt ready
for so soon, yet it looked like unless we could figure something out, we had
a large number of servers that were gone for good.]</em></span>
</p><p>
I jumped on the phone and called VMware while Kyle continued
troubleshooting. After a few minutes on the line, the problem was
apparent. The LUNs containing the virtual machines had their partition
tables wiped out. We luckily could re-create them, and after a quick reboot
of each VM host, we were back in business, although we were very worried and confused
about the issue. 
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>[Kyle: So that's why that sinking feeling felt familiar. It was the same one
I had the first time I accidentally nuked the partition table on my own
computer with a bad dd command.]</em></span>
</p><p>
Our worry and concern jumped to near-panic when the issue reared its head a
second time, however, under similar circumstances. A physical machine
kickstart wound up nuking the partition table on the SAN LUNs that carried
the virtual machine files. We placed another call to VMware, and after some
log mining, they determined that it wasn't a bug in their software, but
something on our end that was erasing the partition table.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x211e580.0x2217118"></a>
A Light Dawns</h2></div></div><p>
Kyle and I started to piece together the chain of events and realized that
each time this occurred, it was preceded by a kickstart of a blade server.
That led us to look at the actual kickstart control file we were using, 
and it turned out there was one line in there that caused the whole problem.
The directive <tt  >clearpart --all --initlabel</tt> would erase the partition table
on all disks attached to a particular host, which made sense if the
server in question had local disks, but these blades were attached to the
SAN, and the SAN didn't have any zoning in place to protect against this.
As it turns out, the system did exactly what it
was set up to do. If we had
placed the LUNs in zones, this wouldn't have happened, or if we'd have
audited the kickstart control file and thought about it in advance, the
problem wouldn't have happened either.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>[Kyle: Who would have thought that kickstart would become yet another one of
those UNIX genie-like commands like dd that do <span class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span>
what you say. We not only placed the LUNs in zones, but we also made sure that
the clearpart directive was very specific to clear out only the disks we
wanted&mdash;lucky for us, those HP RAID controllers show up as /dev/cciss/
devices, so it was easy to write the restriction.]</em></span>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x211e580.0x22173d8"></a>
Lessons Learned</h2></div></div><p>
We learned a couple things that day. First was the importance of
zoning your SAN correctly. The assumption we were operating under&mdash;that
these boxes would all want to access the SAN and, therefore, zones were
unnecessary&mdash;was flat out wrong. Second, was the importance of auditing
and understanding work that other sysadmins had done prior and
understanding how that work would affect the new stuff we were
implementing. Needless to say, our SAN always was zoned properly after
that.
