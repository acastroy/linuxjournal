Further notes on custom live CD security.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1415580.0x150d460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The past couple months, I've been showing how to create your
very own customized Ubuntu live CD. In &ldquo;Customizing Linux Live CDs,
Part I&rdquo;
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, May 2008), I provided a basic procedure for mounting an Ubuntu Desktop
7.10 ISO image; removing, adding and updating its software packages;
and repacking it into a new ISO image.
</p><p>
In Part II (<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, June 2008), I showed how to create an encrypted virtual
disk volume using TrueCrypt and explained how to use it in conjunction with your
customized live CD&mdash;for example, by mounting it over the live CD default
user's Documents folder.
</p><p>
This month, I wrap up the endeavor with some odds and ends,
including my thoughts on network d&aelig;mons and firewall scripts, on
plausible deniability scenarios and why you probably don't need to
bother trying to enable user logins with your live CD.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1415580.0x150d7d0"></a>
To Log On, or Not to Log On</h2></div></div><p>
As I was wrapping up Part II last month, I mentioned that the default
account on Ubuntu live CDs, ubuntu, has no password. And, I implied that
next time we might talk about &ldquo;fixing&rdquo; that.
</p><p>
At least, that's what was lurking at the back of my mind when I wrote
the article. Why not, I wondered, set a password for the ubuntu account on
the live CD, and configure GDM to start with a logon prompt?
</p><p>
But, the more I think about this, the less I think it's worth the
effort. Let me take a few minutes to discuss why that may be.
</p><p>
Security is all about risk management. What controls can be employed to
reduce or eliminate the risk of some bad thing happening? Is that risk
likely enough to be worth the trouble of the controls? Does the control
itself add <span   class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> risks?
</p><p>
We set up accounts with passwords in order to mitigate the risk that
some unauthorized person may gain access to system resources or data. On
a system that has multiple users, or that is reachable over networks
(especially if it's always connected), this is a serious risk.
</p><p>
But on an ephemeral system, such as a live CD with no hard drive of its
own, there are better ways to protect access and data. Access is 
controlled easily by setting up your live CD so that when booted, it doesn't run
any network services to which unauthorized users can connect. You can
protect your personal data by keeping all of it elsewhere&mdash;for example,
on a TrueCrypt-encrypted volume on a USB drive, which I showed you how
to set up last month.
</p><p>
The sad fact of the matter is that anybody with physical access to your
live CD in any form (burned onto a CD, or stored as an ISO image) can
simply recustomize it using the same procedure you used and delete the
password field in your custom user account's entry in /etc/passwd. Or,
more likely, the attacker can skip customizing it all together and
simply mount and copy the interesting parts of your squashfs image. No
boot, no login!
</p><p>
This is the same reason that with &ldquo;normal&rdquo; Linux systems (hard
drive or Flash-based systems) physical access is so important. Unless
you're using encrypted system volumes, anybody with physical access to
your Linux computer can reboot from a live CD, mount your hard drive,
and copy and alter system files at will.
</p><p>
So again, the best way to protect the data you use with your live CD is
to store it on an encrypted volume&mdash;either one small enough to fit on
your live CD image (assuming you can live with read-only access to that
data), or one stored on a USB drive. And, the best way to control access
to your live CD system is not to run any network services.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1415580.0x150dd50"></a>
Network Services and Ubuntu Live CDs</h2></div></div><p>
The good news here is that by default, on Ubuntu Desktop 7.10, there are
only two network d&aelig;mons that run by default: the CUPS printing system
and the Avahi d&aelig;mon, which is part of the Zeroconf system for automated
file/music sharing and Voice-over-IP client discovery. And, of these two
things, only Avahi is problematic, because CUPS listens only on the local
loopback interface&mdash;by default, CUPS doesn't accept connections from
nonlocal processes.
</p><p>
How &ldquo;problematic&rdquo; is Avahi? Actually, not necessarily very much so at
all. Truth is, I'm not aware of any critical security vulnerabilities
in Avahi. However, it <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> the only thing standing between you and
a system that accepts no foreign connections! If you disable Avahi, your
system will be <span   class="emphasis"><em>completely</em></span> unresponsive to port scans and security
scans. If a house with locked doors is secure, a house with no doors at
all is <span   class="emphasis"><em>extremely</em></span> secure.
</p><p>
Disabling Avahi is a very simple step to add to the process of customizing
an Ubuntu live CD (see the Appendix for the commands described in Part
I of this series). Once you've mounted your ISO, mounted your squashfs
image, and chrooted yourself into your live CD image's root filesystem
(steps 00 through 12 in the Appendix), you need to issue only one command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
12.5-# update-rc.d -f avahi-daemon remove
</pre>
</p><p>
You could, of course, also run a personal firewall script to be extra
safe. But in this context (bootable-CD-based desktop), I'm not convinced
it's worth the trouble, if it's possible to run without network d&aelig;mons
in the first place. First, you can't necessarily be sure what your local
IP address and Ethernet interface names will be, if you're going to run
your live CD from random hardware, such as coffee-shop workstations. This
makes it difficult to write things like anti-IP-spoofing rules.
</p><p>
Second, neither Ubuntu nor Debian (on which it's based) has a native
firewall script service. If they did, you simply could add your firewall
rules to an existing script somewhere in /etc, as with RHEL and
SUSE. Instead, with Debian and Ubuntu, you either need to create your own
startup script or install additional software like Firestarter on your
live CD image, <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> configure that software on some
<span   class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span>
system the way you want it on the live CD, <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> copy the resulting
configuration file(s) over to your live CD's filesystem.
</p><p>
Again, in this context, going network-d&aelig;mon-free is much simpler. Note,
however, that this is one of very, very few situations in which I
recommend against using iptables for local protection. Ordinarily,
that is an important protection!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1415580.0x150e328"></a>
Plausible Deniability, Live CDs and TrueCrypt</h2></div></div><p>
Suppose you're a human-rights activist working in a country with a
paranoid, totalitarian government, and you use a live CD for sending
factual reports to the press about local civil-rights abuses. Suppose
further you want to prevent your live CD or the accompanying TrueCrypt
volume you keep on your USB Flash drive from being used as direct or
circumstantial evidence that you've been &ldquo;committing treason&rdquo;.
</p><p>
I have three easy suggestions for you. First, <span   class="emphasis"><em>don't</em></span> customize
your live CD; instead, use a <span   class="emphasis"><em>standard</em></span> live CD from Ubuntu Desktop,
Linux Mint or whatever your favorite distribution is. If you've got a
lot of customized but mundane settings for your desktop manager, you
can store them in an unencrypted loopback file image on your USB drive
and manually mount it over /etc or your home directory.
</p><p>
In some places in this crazy world of ours, simply possessing a CD
containing Tor, Privoxy and other privacy/anonymity tools is all the
proof somebody needs that you're up to no good. Besides, this has the
added advantage of being less work than using a customized live CD!
</p><p>
Second, use a TrueCrypt hidden volume. Keep only boring things in the
nonhidden part of your TrueCrypt volume.
</p><p>
You can refer to the TrueCrypt link in the Resources section of this
article for more
information, but suffice it to say that this feature takes advantage
of the fact that once you create a TrueCrypt volume, its size remains
constant. Empty space is filled with random data. Or, as the case may be,
with random data plus a hidden volume that is impossible to distinguish
from the random data, except by someone who knows both that the
TrueCrypt volume contains a hidden volume and the hidden
volume's passphrase.
</p><p>
My third suggestion is to rename the TrueCrypt binary you'll need to keep
on your USB drive (because you're using a stock Linux live CD), and while
you're at it, make sure your TrueCrypt volume (or volumes) isn't named
conspicuously. Both the TrueCrypt binary itself (which, by default, is named
truecrypt) and TrueCrypt volumes can be called whatever you like.
</p><p>
So, there's nothing to stop you from renaming truecrypt to something
inconspicuous like cooking-schools.dat, and your TrueCrypt volume file
to checkered-pants-sources.dat. Anybody who executes cooking-schools.dat
will, of course, immediately see the TrueCrypt GUI, but why would someone
try to execute what appears to be a data file? Note that the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span>
feasible way to identify a TrueCrypt volume as such is to try to mount
it with TrueCrypt.
</p><p>
By telling you these three things, naturally I trust you'll use this
knowledge for good, and not for evil&mdash;for example, by committing real
kinds of treason that don't involve simply speaking the truth.

Ubuntu 8.04 and Debian Live</b></p><p>
There are two things that are mostly out of scope for this article,
but worth bringing to your attention nonetheless. The first is that Ubuntu
Desktop 8.04 will have been available for at least a month by the time
you read this, but it was still in beta testing at the time I wrote this
article.
</p><p>
Needless to say, I didn't have enough time to do a comprehensive check of
my live-CD-customizing procedure (see Appendix) against Ubuntu 8.04. But,
I did mess around with it enough to determine that my procedure is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>probably</em></span> 100% compatible and relevant with Ubuntu 8.04.
</p><p>
The only strangeness I encountered is that the squashfs image on the
Ubuntu 8.04 live CD uses a new version of the squashfs file format. You
won't be able to use earlier versions of Ubuntu to remaster 8.04 images
unless you compile a kernel (or at least the squashfs kernel module) from
raw source from kernel.org. Support for the new version of squashfs
has not, to my knowledge, been backported to the kernel in Ubuntu 7.10.
</p><p>
Second, an alert reader recently pointed out to me that Debian, a
distribution that normally ships on 21 CDs, now has a
live CD version that is very easily customized. See Resources
for a URL to the Debian Live Project's Wiki.

Parting Notes</h2></div></div><p>
In this series of columns, I've really only gotten you started down
the custom live CD path, but hopefully well enough for you to figure out
more ways to use and customize Ubuntu live CDs on your own. Here are a
few things you might have fun figuring out:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Pre-installing and preconfiguring Firefox plugins, such as NoScript
and RefControl.
</p></li><li><p>
Incorporating dmcrypt for encrypted system volumes.
</p></li><li><p>
Pre-installing and preconfiguring the bittorrent and bittorrent-gui
packages.
</p></li><li><p>
Customizing GNOME for maximum elite-looking-ness.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Whether you're an intrepid human-rights activist or simply someone with a
need for a maximally portable Linux system, live CDs are a handy, simple
and potentially safe way to run Linux without changing or leaving any
trace of itself on the hardware on which it's run.
</p><p>
By the way, I'm taking next month off from the Paranoid Penguin (though
not from being paranoid, of course), but I'll be back in two
months. Until then, be safe!
