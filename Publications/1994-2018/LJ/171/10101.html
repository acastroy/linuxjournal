<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> has called on all <span   class="bold"><b>Cogito</b></span> users to switch over to using
<span   class="bold"><b>git</b></span> natively. When Linus first created git, he envisioned a tool that
would provide a clean set of very low-level data-tracking actions.
There was no point, he felt, in writing a bunch of complex, high-level
revision control features, especially considering his existing
penchant for system internals. The git tool was to be the &ldquo;system
call&rdquo; layer, on top of which people could script their own favorite
feature set. Cogito was the first attempt at such a wrapper, and for
a while, it was the only way for people to use git without having to have
a deep understanding of git's data-tracking concepts. But nowadays,
git has added its own set of porcelain commands on top of the deeper
plumbing. People still can use the lower-level commands to script
their favorite front-end interface, but git's native high-level
interface is likely to stay more up to date than any of those scripts,
because it is so integrated into the original tool. Cogito itself, as
Linus points out, has not been maintained for more than a year, and he says
it's time for everyone just to switch over. This also will, he points
out, have the added benefit that any problems uncovered by users will
be debugged and fixed more easily, as the developers won't have to
worry about which tool might have the bug.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kernel development</b></span> is always much messier than application
development. When an application crashes, you can start to
debug the core file or restart the application immediately for another test. When
the kernel crashes, you typically have to reboot, which can be
time-consuming. Kernel developers always are looking for ways to 
restart a test quickly or to identify potential bugs without actually having to
experience the bad results of running into them. One
technique that's been available for a while is to run the kernel as a
user application itself on an already-running system, so that if the
userland instance crashes, the rest of the system remains intact. That
is so cool! Another attempt has recently come from <span   class="bold"><b>Thomas Gleixner</b></span>.
His concept is to insert a whole new layer of debugging code in the
kernel (it would be disabled for folks who just want to use their
system) to track what happens to RAM after it has been allocated for
clusters of variables. If the data suddenly changes when it wasn't
supposed to, Thomas' code sees this as a big red flag and logs it.
So, instead of discovering a bug because the entire system locks up,
developers now, in many cases, can discover bugs before any symptoms
affect the user experience. It's possible that Thomas will merge his
code with something <span   class="bold"><b>Chris Mason</b></span> did a
while ago. In Chris' project, a
background thread would allocate memory, mark it with data, and then
check periodically to see whether it had been corrupted. Thomas' and
Chris' approaches are different and complementary in a couple
different ways. For one thing, Thomas' code interacts with actual
kernel objects that are currently in use, while Chris' checks an
unrelated block of memory. Also, Thomas' code performs its checks
after specific kernel operations, while Chris' does its checks after
planned intervals of time. Both are good techniques, and it's likely
that Thomas' code will tend to gather additional features over time.
</p><p>
Some kernel folks are considering alternatives to the <span   class="bold"><b>MAINTAINERS
file</b></span>. <span   class="bold"><b>Krzysztof Halasa</b></span> has suggested the file is no longer necessary
and should be replaced by formatted comments in the code itself. This
way, people interested in finding out whom to talk to about a particular
piece of the kernel would be able to find what they needed right in
the part of the kernel in which they were interested. <span   class="bold"><b>Jan Engelhardt</b></span> is in
favor of this, but added the suggestion that instead of comments,
maintainer information should be embedded in the source code itself.
That way, compiled into the kernel binary, it could be read via a
simple command by anyone who was interested. But, Krzysztof points out
that the only people who are going to be interested in this data are
people hacking on the kernel, so there's no need to bloat
the kernel binary with the information. Regardless, it does seem as
though there is some support for reconsidering how maintainership
information is handled. But, it may be that one of the MAINTAINERS
file's greatest values is how visible it is. It's just fun to poke
around in it! So undoubtedly, a wide range of issues will be hashed
and rehashed by everyone before a decision is made.
</p><p>
It's probably safe to say that the <span   class="bold"><b>2.2
kernel</b></span> is in the utter deep
dark icy freeze of death. The latest release candidate for 2.2.27 is
from January 2005, and efforts to continue to patch it have been met
with resistance. <span   class="bold"><b>Willy Tarreau</b></span> points out that any release, even a
release candidate, might be interpreted by users as an indication that
the 2.2 kernel was being maintained actively&mdash;an impression he did not
feel corresponded to the truth. For one thing, he says that there are
known security fixes that also have not been included in any of the
patches. He feels the 2.2 kernel is just too out of date to bring
back. But <span   class="bold"><b>Xose Vazquez Perez</b></span> feels that if the 2.2 kernel is going to
be that deeply frozen, it shouldn't be listed on the front page of
kernel.org as if it were a living kernel. If it's really dead, let it
die, Xose argues. And, if it's not really dead, let it be updated. But,
it may be that the 2.2 kernel still should be recognized just for
historical value, even if it won't be developed anymore.
</p><p>
Apparently, <span   class="bold"><b>802.11</b></span> is complex&mdash;like, more than usual for the kernel.
It turns out that wireless devices are regulated differently everywhere,
so hardware manufacturers have started producing just a generic
device, relying on the software to implement the regulations&mdash;ouch.
<span   class="bold"><b>Luis R. Rodriguez</b></span> recently suggested constructing a massive database
to keep track of the large and growing variety of legal restrictions
the kernel will have to take account of in order to implement
802.11 properly. And, where would all this data be stored? In the kernel,
naturally! Luis at first suggested an external Web site, something
interactive that the whole community could participate in maintaining.
But, as <span   class="bold"><b>Bruno Randolf</b></span> said, this would make the kernel sources, as far
as 802.11 was concerned, dependent on this external source, while the
kernel itself should be the true source, he said. So, the
kernel probably will grow some very complex 802.11 legal information in the
near future.

<h2 class="title">Man vs. Myth: Greg K-H and the Kernel Driver Project</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #171, July 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Don't tell Greg Kroah-Hartman that Linux hurts for device drivers. He's
heard too much of that rap, and he's already done plenty to stop it. We
should thank him and help pick up the ball. I'm doing both here.
</p><p>
The beginning of the end of the Missing Drivers Myth came at the 2006
Ottowa Linux Symposium, where Greg said, &ldquo;Linux supports more different
types of devices than any other operating system ever has in the history of
computing.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Still, the OSDL (later the Linux Foundation) board&mdash;composed mostly of
large vendors&mdash;listed device drivers as the #2 &ldquo;most pressing
issue&rdquo;. So
the Linux Driver Project (LDP) was created. Alas, Greg reports on his blog,
&ldquo;No vendors showed up.&rdquo; But after he announced, &ldquo;Tell me all of the hardware
that you know of that is not supported by Linux!&rdquo;, he writes,
&ldquo;the response
from users was overwhelming&rdquo;. Thus, a canonical wiki list was created at the
LDP.
</p><p>
After this, Greg went to each vendor personally, and the conversation almost always went like this:
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>GREG:</b></span>
&ldquo;What hardware do you ship that is not currently supported by
Linux?&rdquo;
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>VENDOR:</b></span>
&ldquo;It all is.&rdquo;
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>GREG:</b></span>
&ldquo;But wait, why are you claiming that 'Linux drivers' is your second
most pressing issue today with Linux?&rdquo;
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>VENDOR:</b></span>
&ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Thanks to those clues, missing drivers is out of the board members' top ten
pressing issues.
</p><p>
But, there always is work to be done. As Greg puts it, that work falls into
four categories of user complaints. Here they are, with excerpts of Greg's
responses to each:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Printer and scanner support:
&ldquo;...already being handled very well by the Linux Printing Project and
the SANE Project. Printer and scanner drivers in Linux are user-space
programs and libraries and have nothing to do with the kernel at all. If
you have any issues with these types of devices, please go ask the
developers of those projects about them.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
Older devices no longer manufactured that people really want to see
working on their Linux machines someday:
&ldquo;...is hard. It would be great for Linux to support all of these
older devices, but without the specs for the device, or in many cases, a
company that is still in business, Linux support is going to be very
difficult to achieve....Luckily, for almost all modern hardware devices,
it is not necessary.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
Wireless device support:
&ldquo;the Linux-Wireless group of developers has done an amazing amount
of work in the past year, adding a whole new wireless protocol stack to the
Linux kernel, as well as numerous different hardware drivers, some
initially created by vendors and others created by reverse-engineering the
hardware with no vendor help or approval. The latest kernel.org releases
contain a raft of new hardware support for wireless drivers, and the number
of active drivers in the queue to be added in the near future is quite
large. Alas, there are still some wireless vendors that do not provide
Linux support directly. Two of these, Atheros and Broadcom, have drivers
created by the community through reverse-engineering efforts....Hopefully,
this will change in the future.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
Video input device support:
&ldquo;...there is an active Linux developer community in this area, but
it seems to be hampered by a different development model...and a lack of
full-time developers, not to mention a high degree of interpersonal
conflicts that seem quite strange to outsiders. Support for a large
majority of these devices is slowly trickling into the main kernel
tree&mdash;the most important being the USB video class driver, which will support
almost all new USB video devices in the future, thereby removing the major
problem most users will face when purchasing a new video device.&rdquo;
</p></li></ol></div><p>
In addition to further education, Greg has opened development by keeping
all code related to the LDP in a quilt patch series that is
automatically included in the linux-next-daily kernel releases, which are
then contained in a git tree that &ldquo;provides a place where developers can
provide changes, updates and see where they can help out if they wish to
do so in a much easier manner. It also provides a way for companies
participating to observe the status of their code in a much more open
manner.&rdquo;
</p><p>
It would be nice if Atheros and Broadcom were among those companies.

In April 2008 (at the time of this writing), the Linux Foundation published a progress
report with the plain-wrapper title &ldquo;Linux Kernel Development&rdquo;, authored
by Greg Kroah-Hartman, Jonathan Corbet and Amanda McPherson. Relying
heavily on Jonathan's gitdb and other tools, they probed the kernel.org
Web site and the git kernel depository and organized the results into a
neatly arranged assortment of tasty nuggets. Here are a few of them:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
For each day during the past 2.5 years, 3,621 lines were added, 1,550
lines removed and 1,425 lines changed. &ldquo;That rate of change is larger
than any other public software project of any size.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
Fifteen percent of kernel code contributions during the past three years
have come from the top ten individual developers. Thirty percent has come
from the top 30 developers.
</p></li><li><p>
The top five individual developers, in order, were Al Viro, David
S. Miller, Adrian Bunk, Raif Baechle and Andrew Morton. Each contributed
more than a thousand changes.
</p></li><li><p>
More than 70% of kernel development is being done by contributors
being paid for their work.
</p></li><li><p>
The size of the individual development community has doubled in the
last three years.
</p></li><li><p>
Of 31 listed corporate sources of kernel code changes (that is,
companies employing individual developers contributing changes), the top
two, with 13.9% and 12.9%, respectively, were None and Unknown. These
were followed in order by Red Hat (11.2%), Novell (8.9%), IBM (8.3%)
and Intel (4.1%). &ldquo;The numbers presented are necessarily
approximate&rdquo;,
the report says.
</p></li><li><p>
Companies outside the IT business contribute too. For example,
&ldquo;the 2.6.25 kernel will include an implementation of the PF_CAN
network protocol, which was contributed by Volkswagen. PF_CAN allows
for reliable communications between components in an interference-prone
environment&mdash;such as that found in an automobile.&rdquo;
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The concluding line is a model of hedged understatement: &ldquo;With the
current expansion of Linux in the server, desktop and embedded markets,
it's reasonable to expect this number of contributing companies&mdash;and
individual developers&mdash;will continue to increase.&rdquo;

Nicco Mele was born in West Africa, has lived all over the world, speaks
many languages, and produces, among many other things, the Junglecast
podcasts.
</p><p>
He also is probably the only human&mdash;and certainly the only geek&mdash;who
has worked for a full house of presidential candidates: Howard Dean, Barack
Obama, Hillary Clinton and John McCain. I first met Nicco in the server
room of the Dean campaign in Burlington, Vermont, in the winter of 2004.
The servers were running Linux. Geeks with laptops were flopped all over
the place, hacking in Drupal and otherwise pioneering the political hackery
now being leveraged in countless campaigns and political Web sites and
services. Nicco ran that show.
</p><p>
Now he runs EchoDitto, an Internet strategy and consulting company with
offices in New York, Washington, DC and Cambridge, Massachusetts, where we are
neighbors and get to hang out. &ldquo;At work, we rely heavily on customized
Drupal and WordPress setups&rdquo;, he says. But what he'd rather talk about is
his home tech life:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I'm a believer in open source, well beyond just technology. For

This begins with the Man Cave. When my wife and I, as newlyweds, bought
our first home about 9 months ago, my wife&mdash;terrified of the
proliferation of cables around our old apartment&mdash;offered me the basement
for all of my technological needs. And lo! The Man Cave was born. With a
110" screen, a hi-def projector and surround sound&mdash;and complete
darkness in the bright noon of day, the Man Cave is ideal for consuming
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Battlestar Galactica</em></span>. Managing all this with open source? Enter my MythTV
box, recently upgraded thanks to the wonders of&mdash;Woot!&mdash;Core 2 Quad Q6600
processor with four cores on one chip. Two 320GB 7200 RPM SATA drives for
640 gigs. Add some free software, and I've got a DVR and media server that

<h2 class="title">Olympic MIDs</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #171, July 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
From a Linux perspective, the most remarkable location at January's CES
(Consumer Electronics Show) was Intel's Mobility booth. It was so crowded,
I could barely elbow my way to the display cases. When I asked to see
gear that ran Linux, I was told Linux was running on most of the gear they
were showing there.
</p><p>
And sure enough, it was. I got to see and handle MIDs, or Mobile Internet
Devices, from Lenovo, Clarion, Aigo, Samsung and Digifriends. Most appeared
to be running China's Red Flag Linux and the CoolFox
browser&mdash;obviously,
a Mozilla derivative. The UIs were modeled on the iPhone, with square
application icons and a &ldquo;coverflow&rdquo;-like file browser that let you fan
horizontally or vertically through choices.

</p><p>
Since then, it has become clear that Intel and its OEMs are pushing to have
some of these products ready for the Summer Olympics in Beijing. It should
be interesting to see not only how much reporting in the wild is made
possible by these new Linux handhelds, but also how many cool new hacks on them
will be encouraged by the setting.
</p><p>
Of particular interest to me is the Lenovo Ideapad U8 Mobile Internet
Device, for two reasons.
</p><p>
First, Lenovo is already the first major PC hardware OEM to market Linux
aggressively. Its US index page (<a href="http://lenovo.com/us/en" target="_self">lenovo.com/us/en</a>) at
the time of this writing (in
April 2008) says, &ldquo;ThinkPad notebooks with Linux&rdquo; right up front, rather than
buried somewhere down the directory tree.
</p><p>
Second, the Ideapad U8 is an interesting device. It lacks the slide-out
keyboard of the Nokia N810 (the Linux pioneer in the category), but it has a
virtual QWERTY keyboard that can pop up along the bottom of the
screen&mdash;plus a numeric hardware keypad on the right of the screen for T9
predictive text entry. In addition to the touchscreen (for finger or
stylus), it has a hardware pointer reminiscent of the familiar red ThinkPad
nub, but with no moving parts. And it has a bunch of other features you'd
expect in a Linux handheld PC.
</p><p>
The Ideapad U8 was vetted at the Spring 2008 Intel Developer Forum in
Shanghai, where Intel also shared details of the Menlow platform on which
the device (along with many others) is based. Menlow puts the new
Silverthorne CPU on the single-chip Poulsbo chipset. Significantly, at
least one of the units being shown came with a colorful back badged with
Olympics imagery.
</p><p>
An open question at this point is hackability. Nokia has openly courted and
supported individual developers through the Maemo development platform.
Nokia's purchase of Trolltech earlier this year also says it's serious
about Linux development on mobile devices. Will Menlow-based MIDs veer in
the &ldquo;applianced&rdquo; direction (like the iPhone) or the
&ldquo;generative&rdquo; direction
(like the Nokia MIDs)? For more about the difference, read &ldquo;A Tale of Two
Futures&rdquo; in this month's EOF on page 96.
</p><p>
From what I gather by talking to Intel folks, these new MIDs are more
likely to veer generative, on the model of the ASUS Eee PC, which
ships with Xandros jiggered for &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; use, but which also remains
completely hackable. We look forward to reports from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> readers
as these new MIDs flow into the market starting this summer. May the best
ones win.
