Integrate OpenID into any Rails application, using off-the-shelf libraries and a bit of
custom code.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b7b580.0x1c73358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The past few months, we've looked at two different ways to
authenticate users coming to a Web site. First, we looked at OpenID,
an increasingly popular distributed authentication system. With
OpenID, users control their information, as well as which
applications are allowed to use that information.
</p><p>
Last month, we looked at acts_as_authenticated, a plugin for the Ruby
on Rails framework that is quite traditional, asking visitors to enter
a user name and password in order to access restricted services.
</p><p>
This month, we take an initial look at how we might be able to
incorporate OpenID&mdash;and by extension, a combination of OpenID and
traditional authentication&mdash;into our own Rails applications. In
OpenID lingo, we want our application to be a &ldquo;consumer&rdquo;, asking an
OpenID &ldquo;provider&rdquo; of the user's choosing for authentication
information, rather than gathering and checking that information
ourselves.
</p><p>
OpenID is a pretty well established standard, and integration into a
Rails application isn't all that difficult. However, the number of
OpenID-supporting libraries and plugins has gotten a bit out of
control, such that it's sometimes hard to know (or believe) which ones
actually work, not to mention which ones are easiest to work with.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b7b580.0x1c73720"></a>
Authentication and OpenID</h2></div></div><p>
Authenticating users for a Web site is normally a straightforward
task. You ask users, via an HTML form, to enter their user names and
passwords, and then compare that combination against the database.
(For security purposes, of course, it's usually best to encrypt the
password in the database, and then compare the encrypted
input with what is in the database.) If the user name/password
combination exists in the database, the user can log in.
</p><p>
Of course, HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means there isn't
really any such thing as being &ldquo;logged in&rdquo;. Rather, we rely on
cookies, pieces of data provided by the server but stored in the
user's browser, which are passed to the server with each subsequent
HTTP request. In this system, logging in takes place when the
server sets a cookie on the user's browser. In Rails and many other
Web frameworks, cookies also are used to keep track of a user's
&ldquo;session&rdquo;, attributes associated with this user on this browser.
</p><p>
In order to incorporate OpenID into a Web application, we don't need
to replace the whole cookie/session/login portion of the framework.
Rather, we need to change the way we authenticate users,
setting the login cookie after an OpenID provider has indicated that a
user has been identified legitimately.
</p><p>
A traditional Rails-based login system would involve an HTML form, a
controller action that compares the submitted form values against a
database, and then a login page. To replace this with OpenID, we
need to modify our controller such that it asks an OpenID server
to authenticate the user.
</p><p>
But, wait a second. The whole point of OpenID is that users
enter a URL (that is, their unique OpenID), and that they authenticate
against a server associated with that URL. This means the HTML
form needs to change, such that it asks for a URL instead of a
user name and password.
</p><p>
Moreover, we have to take into account the fact that our server
needs to redirect users to an OpenID server, which then
will redirect back to our system, indicating whether the user has
logged in successfully.
</p><p>
There are, as I indicated above, many Ruby- and Rails-related
resources having to do with OpenID. Unfortunately, many of them are poorly
documented, out of date or relatively hard to use. For example,
there is a Ruby gem called openid_login and a plugin called
open_id_authentication that might well work with a bit of hacking.
But, their documentation is out of date, and I encountered problems
with, among other things, the double suffixes (.html.erb) that Rails
now uses with templates. So, although I'm sure it's possible to get
this gem to work with OpenID and modern Rails installations, it 
probably will take time and effort&mdash;more than I would expect from a
prepackaged solution.
</p><p>
Thus, my suggested solution to the whole question of OpenID is to use
the simple, low-level ruby-openid gem, which happens to have support
for Rails applications built in. This gem is actually very
well documented in its current form&mdash;version 2.0.4 at the time of this writing.
But, be careful; much of the documentation you'll find on-line is out
of date and implements OpenID-related functionality using the 1.x
version of this gem with an older, incompatible API.
</p><p>
To install the gem, of course, we write:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gem install ruby-openid
</pre>
</p><p>
We then create a controller for handling our OpenID-related
actions:


<pre     class="programlisting">
script/generate controller openid new create complete openid_consumer
</pre>
</p><p>
These four actions, the fourth of which is private, are what we'll
need in order for people to log in with OpenID.
</p><p>
Now we can create an HTML form in a view; I created this simple view
as login.html.erb within views/openid/new.html.erb:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Log in with OpenID&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;% if not flash[:error].blank? %&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;%= flash[:error] -%&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;% end %&gt;

    &lt;% form_tag "/openid/create" do %&gt;
      &lt;%= text_field_tag "openid_url" %&gt;
      &lt;%= submit_tag "Log in with OpenID" %&gt;
    &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Because everything between &lt;% and %&gt; in an ERb template is evaluated as
Ruby code, we'll need to understand what is going on here. First, we
create a form that is not connected to any object using the form_tag
helper. (If the form were connected to an object, we would
simply use the form helper.) We give it a URL of /openid, which
we will discuss in a little bit, when we look at routing.
</p><p>
The form contains a single text field, whose name and id
attributes both will be set to openid_url. Modern browsers
recognize this name and use it to fill in an OpenID
URL automatically. A submit button and a closing end tag complete the form.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b7b580.0x1c73f60"></a>
Storing User Information</h2></div></div><p>
When we display this form in our browser, the user has one option&mdash;namely, to sign in with OpenID by entering a URL. The action
(create) that is invoked has to find the user's OpenID server
and redirect to that server. In order to do this, we need an
instance of OpenID::Consumer, an object defined by the ruby-openid
gem. Because we will continue to need this, we can create it as an
instance variable:


<pre     class="programlisting">
def openid_consumer
 if @openid_consumer.blank?
   @openid_consumer =
     OpenID::Consumer.new(session,
           OpenID::Store::Filesystem.new("#{RAILS_ROOT}/tmp/openid"))
 end

 return @openid_consumer
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that we're storing the OpenID information on the filesystem, in
the tmp directory under the root of our Rails project directory.
This is a bad idea when you have multiple Web servers, but is
certainly good enough for a small or beginning site.
</p><p>
Now that we have a method named openid_consumer and an instance
variable named @openid_consumer, we can implement the create action,
to which our HTML form is going to be submitted:


<pre     class="programlisting">
def create
 # Get the OpenID parameter
 openid_url = params[:openid_url]

 # Make sure we got something
 if openid_url.blank?
   flash[:error] = "No OpenID was entered; try again"
   redirect_to :back
   return
 end

 # Get an OpenID response
 openid_response = openid_consumer.begin openid_url

 home_url = url_for :controller =&gt; "openid", :action =&gt; "index"
 complete_url = url_for :controller =&gt; "openid", :action =&gt; "complete"
 openid_redirect_url = openid_response.redirect_url(home_url, complete_url)
 redirect_to openid_redirect_url

 return
end
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, we get the user's OpenID URL, and we check that it
wasn't blank. Then, we use our instance of OpenID::Consumer to begin
the OpenID login process, using open_consumer.begin, passing it the
user's OpenID URL. If all goes well, this returns an instance of
SuccessRequest, which also hands us the URL to which we should
redirect the user. (If the request fails, the response will be a
subclass of OpenIDStatus.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b7b580.0x1c742d0"></a>
Completing the Login Process</h2></div></div><p>
When we send the user to the user's OpenID server, we have to provide
two different URLs as arguments: one that we're calling home_url,
and the other that we're calling complete_url. The former is the root
URL of our site; typically, it'll be a top-level URL. The latter,
complete_url, tells the OpenID server to which URL the user should be
redirected after logging in. In both cases, I use the built-in Rails
url_for method, which constructs a URL out of a controller and
action name.
</p><p>
When the user returns from the OpenID server, it will be to the URL
indicated in complete_url. This means we have to define our
complete method as well:


<pre     class="programlisting">
def complete
 home_url = url_for :controller =&gt; "openid", :action =&gt; "index"
 complete_url = url_for :controller =&gt; "openid", :action =&gt; "complete"

 openid_response = openid_consumer.complete(params, complete_url)

 session[:openid] = openid_response.identity_url
 flash[:error] = "You have been logged in as '#{session[:openid]}'"
 redirect_to :action =&gt; "new"
 return
end
</pre>
</p><p>
After defining home_url and complete_url once again, we invoke the
complete method on our instance of OpenID::Consumer. If the
response is good (and here we assume that it is, ignoring the
possibility that we might have gotten an instance of OpenIDStatus
back). Obviously, your real-life applications should include such a
check.
</p><p>
Sure enough, when we put all this in place, it works! We can
enter our user ID into the HTML form. We get verified by the user's
OpenID server, even if that means another redirect. And, we get the
user verified with basic information.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
OpenID is a simple but powerful idea that is slowly but surely
transforming the way we manage identities on the Internet. A
growing number of applications use OpenID, and it is becoming
increasingly popular among users as well.
</p><p>
Adding OpenID to an application does not need to be complicated or
difficult. As I show this month, incorporating OpenID into a Rails
application requires understanding one particular Ruby object, namely
OpenID::Consumer, and the odd, redirect-based, three-part OpenID login
system specification.
