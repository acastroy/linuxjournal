A review of some current state-of-the-art digital TV tuner cards, focusing
on how well they support digital television in Linux.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x151c580.0x16142a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
My ten-year-old TV set gave out recently. Being a Linux geek, I use a
variety of open-source distributions on my notebook and desktop. So,
the demise of my TV was a great opportunity to see if I could watch
television on Linux instead of getting another TV set. It's just in time
too, because over-the-air television broadcasts in the US will convert
to all digital in February 2009. So, it was exciting to switch
over to digital TV on my desktop.
</p><p>
In my quest to understand the state of digital TV (DTV) on Linux, I
looked at digital TV tuner cards, antennas and accessories. I chose
to set up MythTV, and by the end of the entire experience, I had a
cool digital TV right on my Linux desktop with Picture-in-Picture and
remote control. It was enough high-definition (HD) TV to turn me into
a serious couch potato. I'm happy to report that Linux,
along with hardware support from digital TV tuner cards, video cards,
LCD monitors and rich software, such as MythTV, is ready for prime
time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x151c580.0x1614510"></a>
Digital TV Environment</h2></div></div><p>
For this review, I used a PC with an Intel Core 2 Duo 3GHz, with
4GB memory, an NVIDIA 8800 GT graphics card, and a 750GB SATA hard
disk. The display was a Samsung SyncMaster 245BW, with a resolution
of 1920x1200. I ran Ubuntu 7.10, with all the latest updates, as my
operating system. Using a powerful graphics card was essential for
viewing HD programs on a high-resolution, wide-screen display.
</p><p>
A good antenna also is a critical component of the DTV setup. I
tested both indoor and outdoor antennas, and discovered that the reception
improved dramatically when using an outdoor antenna. The reception
also improved with amplified indoor antennas. Standard indoor antennas
performed adequately only when positioned very carefully. Because HDTV
content is high-resolution (1920x1080), if your signal is weak, you may
see a lot of artifacts. Frequent artifacts result in a very poor viewing
experience. Hence, choosing an amplified indoor antenna or an outdoor
antenna is recommended. Standard-definition TV (SDTV) is not as high-resolution and has greater tolerance for weak broadcast signals. But,
even here a good antenna is essential.
</p><p>
I used MythTV (version 0.20.2) to view over-the-air DTV
channels. MythTV is an open-source home entertainment software application
for Linux and Mac OS. It has grown to become one of the most comprehensive,
feature-rich platforms for viewing and recording television programming from
over-the-air and cable broadcasts. I also used another open-source
software application called tvtime (version 1.0.2)
to view over-the-air analog NTSC channels.
</p><p>
So, what can we watch? There are a lot of over-the-air programs available in all
major US metropolitan areas. For example, ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC offer
standard and high-definition programming in addition to analog NTSC. In my
location, the San Francisco Bay area, local public broadcasting stations
(PBS) broadcast high-quality educational and topical content in HDTV
format from 5pm to 6am each day.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x151c580.0x1614720"></a>
Digital Tuner Card Evaluation</h2></div></div><p>
To evaluate various digital tuner cards, I tested first whether the
hardware was recognized by Linux at boot time by checking the system
logs. If it wasn't recognized, I had to find and build a device driver
manually. Once this step was successful, I configured the tuner card
within MythTV. As a part of configuration, MythTV scans for channels
available in the broadcast area. On average, it took MythTV about seven
minutes to find more than 25 digital channels. Once the channels were found,
we were ready to watch digital TV. 
</p><p>
I evaluated a range of digital tuners that included PCI, PCI Express
and USB bus types.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x151c580.0x1614880"></a>
pcHDTV HD-5500</h2></div></div><p>
The pcHDTV HD-5500 is a PCI card and is the only hardware designed and
marketed to support Linux right out of the box. The HD-5500 supports
digital (ATSC), analog (NTSC) and unencrypted cable TV signals. This
low-profile PCI card provides a coaxial input for a TV antenna, a
stereo audio output jack for analog TV and a nine-pin port for an adapter
cable. The adapter cable provides inputs for S-Video and stereo audio, an
RCA video output, and an IR transmitter (to control a set-top box). pcHDTV
ships a CD with the HD-5500 tuner card, which includes drivers for 2.4 and
older 2.6 kernels, command-line tools to capture and manipulate digital
(ATSC) data streams and signals, and a version of the Xine video player
customized to support HDTV.
</p><p>
This tuner card worked out of the box&mdash;configuration was as easy as
installing the card into the PCI slot of my desktop test machine. Both the
digital (ATSC) and analog (NTSC) tuners on the hardware were recognized
right away and were fully functional at system bootup. Configuring the
tuner as a &ldquo;DVB DTV capture card (v3.x)&rdquo; in MythTV was simple. If I had
installed additional pcHDTV cards, I could have tested out multicard
features, such as Picture-in-Picture (PiP) in MythTV. pcHDTV claims you
can put up to four such cards in a single system.
</p><p>
The picture quality for both high-definition and standard-definition
programs was superb. To top it off, the whole idea of having an
end-to-end Linux DTV solution with a no-fuss setup and a great viewing
experience is just plain cool. The HD-5500 is an ideal choice for a
desktop Linux system. It would be nice to have a USB version for laptops
as well. A remote control, as offered by several other DTV tuner products,
would be icing on the cake.
</p><p>
I had the chance to catch up with pcHDTV's CEO, Jack Kelliher, by
e-mail (see the Interview with Jack Kelliher, CEO and Cofounder of pcHDTV
sidebar).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x151c580.0x1614b40"></a>
Pinnacle PCTV HD Pro Stick</h2></div></div><p>
Pinnacle's PCTV HD Pro Stick is a USB 2.0 tuner card that supports both
digital (ATSC) as well as analog (NTSC) TV signals. This tuner card
comes with a portable telescopic antenna, a mini-remote control with
batteries, a USB extender cable and an A/V adapter cable with inputs
for S-Video, composite video (RCA) and stereo audio (1/8" jack). An
integrated infra-red (IR) receiver on the device supports the remote
control. This tuner card is slightly bigger than a typical USB thumbdrive and has a coaxial TV antenna input on one end and a USB connector
on the other. When plugged in to my system, the tuner's width blocked
adjacent USB ports. However, using the USB extender cable that came with
the tuner card circumvented this problem. The portable antenna that
comes with this card is good enough for viewing nearby HDTV channels,
but it always helps to have an amplified antenna.
</p><p>
Out of the box, this card is not supported under Linux. To get this
card to work with Linux, I had to download and compile its driver. I
discovered that this tuner is based on an Empiatech EM2880 chipset, whose
support has been added to the latest development version of the Video
for Linux Digital Video Broadcasting (v4l-dvb) Project. I downloaded
the v4l-dvb development source code and compiled the necessary modules
for the running kernel (see the Building Device Drivers for Pinnacle PCTV
HD Pro Stick and Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-950 on Ubuntu 7.10 sidebar). Compiling the kernel modules
went through without a hitch, and after a system reboot, the Pinnacle
PCTV HD Pro Stick was recognized by the system. Its digital (ATSC) tuner
was registered as a DVB front end (/dev/dvb/adapter0), and its analog
(NTSC) tuner was accessible as a v4l video device (/dev/video0).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x151c580.0x1614ca0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Building Device Drivers for Pinnacle PCTV HD Pro Stick and
Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-950 on Ubuntu 7.10</b></p><p>
First, enable universe and multiverse package repositories by selecting
System&rarr;Administration&rarr;Software Sources from the GNOME
desktop menu.
Click on the tab labeled Ubuntu Software, and make sure the boxes are checked for Community-maintained Open Source
software (universe) and Software restricted by copyright or legal issues
(multiverse).
Click Close.
</p><p>
Next, apply all latest updates from Ubuntu by selecting
System&rarr;Administration&rarr;Update Manager from the GNOME
desktop menu, apply all system updates, and reboot the system.
</p><p>
Then, in a terminal, do <tt  >sudo su</tt>
to become the root user.
Install the necessary packages to build em28xx kernel modules:

<pre     class="programlisting">
aptitude install mercurial build-essential linux-source
</pre>
</p><p>
Download firmware version 4, necessary for USB tuner cards:


<pre     class="programlisting">
wget -q http://konstantin.filtschew.de/v4l-firmware/firmware_v4.tgz
&#8618;-O /usr/local/src/firmware_v4.tgz
</pre>
</p><p>
Unpack the firmware files into /lib/firmware:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar xzf /usr/local/src/firmware_v4.tgz -C /lib/firmware
</pre>
</p><p>
Grab the latest copy of the V4L DVB source code from <a href="http://mcentral.de" target="_self">mcentral.de</a>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/src
hg clone http://mcentral.de/hg/~mrec/v4l-dvb-kernel
</pre>
</p><p>
Compile the V4L DVB drivers:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/src/v4l-dvb-kernel
make
make install
</pre>
</p><p>
And, finally, reboot the system.
</p></div><p>
After configuring the tuner as a &ldquo;DVB DTV capture card (v3.x)&rdquo; in MythTV,
I was able to tune into standard-definition and high-definition
programs. Picture quality for HD programs was fantastic, with astonishing
crispness and clarity compared to SD programs. The viewing experience
for this USB device was excellent.
</p><p>
I used tvtime to evaluate the analog TV performance. The picture quality was
significantly better for stations with transmission towers that were
geographically closer. Initially, sound did not work in tvtime. Using
sox to route audio from tvtime to the default ALSA sound device solved
the problem. Research on the Web indicated that many others have faced
this same issue when using tvtime. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x151c580.0x16154e0"></a>
Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-950</h2></div></div><p>
The Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-950 is a USB 2.0 HDTV tuner card, which is very
similar to the Pinnacle PCTV HD Pro Stick, except the Hauppauge
device does not come with a remote control. Like the Pinnacle PCTV HD Pro
Stick, it supports digital (ATSC), analog (NTSC) as well as unencrypted
cable TV signals. This card comes with a portable telescopic antenna,
USB extender cable and A/V adapter cable with inputs for S-Video,
composite video and stereo audio. I found that the antenna provided with
this card was not as good as the one supplied with the Pinnacle PCTV HD
Pro Stick. In fact, I had to use a better indoor amplified antenna or
an outdoor antenna instead. This card also blocked adjacent USB ports
when plugged in to my system.
</p><p>
Hauppauge does not officially support Linux for this product. But,
this tuner card also is based on the Empiatech EM2880 chipset (same as
Pinnacle's PCTV HD Pro Stick). Hence the same kernel modules built for
the HD Pro Stick worked with this tuner. Follow the steps in the Building
Device Drivers for Pinnacle PCTV HD Pro Stick and
Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-950 on Ubuntu 7.10 sidebar to
build the driver.
</p><p>
The viewing experience for both SD and HD programs and analog TV was
similar to that provided by the Pinnacle PCTV HD Pro Stick.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x151c580.0x1615698"></a>
Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-1800</h2></div></div><p>
The Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-1800 is a PCI Express x1 tuner that also supports
digital (ATSC), analog (NTSC) and unencrypted cable TV signals. This
card has coaxial inputs for analog cable TV, digital ATSC/QAM TV and FM
radio. It also has inputs for S-Video/composite and L/R stereo audio. An
integrated hardware MPEG-2 encoder offloads the system processor when
recording analog TV or cable channels. Accessories include a remote control, USB IR receiver and IR transmitter cable
(to control a set-top unit). 
</p><p>
Out of the box, this tuner is not supported by Linux. However, you can
get the digital (ATSC) tuner to work reliably with Ubuntu 7.10 after you
build its driver (see the Building a Device Driver for Hauppauge
WinTV-HVR-1800 on Ubuntu
7.10 sidebar). The analog TV features for this tuner could not
be evaluated under Linux, because the driver does not yet support the
analog circuitry. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x151c580.0x16157f8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

</pre>
</p><p>
And, reboot the system.
</p></div><p>
After setting up the tuner in MythTV, I was able to view both HD and SD
programs. There was no noticeable difference in picture quality compared
to the USB tuners. The remote control worked well and is fully supported
by LIRC (Linux Infra-Red Control) using the Windows Media
Centre Remotes (new version Philips, et al.) configuration settings in
LIRC. If you're a couch potato, a working remote control in MythTV is
absolutely essential.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x151c580.0x160c6b8"></a>
Digital TV on Linux Is Here Today</h2></div></div><p>
You can experience a great HDTV show on your desktop with the right
equipment and some tweaking. If you're looking to build a full-fledged
media center based on Linux, MythTV does it all&mdash;from program listings,
Picture-in-Picture, remote control support, Web administration with
MythWeb, programmable recording, to watching your favorite shows. If
you're a minimalist and don't want to dedicate an entire system, 
Me-TV looks promising.
</p><p>
It goes without saying that you should do your homework before buying
components for your DTV Linux system. Visit popular on-line forums,
such as the MythTV Wiki, LinuxTV Wiki, Ubuntu Forums and Ubuntu Wiki
to tap into the wisdom of the crowd.
</p><p>
In summary, my recommendations for a great DTV experience include outdoor
antenna, fast multicore processor, medium to high-end video card with
at least 256MB video memory and a fast high-capacity hard drive. For your
desktop, the pcHDTV HD-5500 works right out of the box. The Hauppauge
WinTV-HVR-1800 is a close second. For your laptop, the Pinnacle PCTV HD
Pro Stick and the Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-950 USB tuners work well.

<span   class="bold"><b>AS:</b></span> How did you become interested in building HDTV cards for Linux? Was it
because the technology is open source, or was it a personal interest?
</p><p>
JK: Actually, both. I had an early HD card for Windows but almost
exclusively used Linux and wanted one for Linux. As there were open-source
MPEG players available and a niche market for Linux, I felt that it was
a very doable project that could grow into a small business.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AS:</b></span> What have been your challenges in making the pcHDTV products
successful?
</p><p>
JK: Of course, the first challenge was developing the card, drivers
and modifying a player to handle HD playback, followed by problems in
production. We thought we had a fairly small window of opportunity, as
the FCC was planing to enforce the broadcast flag [a set of status bits
sent in the data
stream of a digital television program that indicates whether 
the data stream can be recorded, or if there are any restrictions on
recorded content], which would not have
been very compatible with Linux. Luckily, the Supreme Court struck this
down, although Congress has considered it a couple times since.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AS:</b></span> What do you find exciting about Linux after many years of working
with the technology?
</p><p>
JK: The extraordinary advances in open-source software, like MythTV, and
very usable video viewing, editing and animation applications&mdash;even
medical applications, like MRI viewers.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AS:</b></span> How do you see your products evolving?
</p><p>
JK: We want to support PCI Express in the future, and we are considering
a small USB product as well.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AS:</b></span> What are your thoughts about targeting your product for European users
(non-ATSC users)?
</p><p>
JK: We have been and are continuing to work on a world-wide solution,
and this has been using up most of our time. The project is fairly large
for us, but we hope to introduce something by the end of the year.
