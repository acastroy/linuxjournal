Toward desktop-like rich Internet applications with OpenLaszlo 4.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29c0580.0x2ab8300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Users' expectations on the Web are changing. No longer content to fill
in forms and wait for pages to refresh, modern Web users want to
interact with the browser in the same way they do with any other desktop
application&mdash;that is, interactively and instantly. Recently, this has
been made easier by the emergence of AJAX and its JavaScript-centred
programming paradigm. But, AJAX is not the only technology that can
help here. There is, of course, the ubiquitous Flash technology, but
its closed-source heritage puts off the community. And, then
there's OpenLaszlo.
</p><p>
Originally a Flash-centric technology, OpenLaszlo Release 4 (hereafter
referred to as OpenLaszlo) breaks free from its Flash heritage and
supports DHTML as an additional deployment platform. This means that
applications written in OpenLaszlo can execute in any browser that
supports DHTML or Flash's SWF, which practically covers every major
browser on every operating system. As the name suggests, OpenLaszlo is
an open-source product, released under the Common Public License, and
OpenLaszlo's creators, Laszlo Systems, are keen to see a strong open-source
developer community form around this main product offering.
</p><p>
OpenLaszlo is billed as a Rich Internet Application (RIA) development
platform. Its goal in life is to add desktop-like functionality
to browser-based applications, and it accomplishes this in a
non-conventional, yet highly productive way. In this article, I explain
how to install and configure OpenLaszlo, and then I present a few small
example applications showcasing some of what OpenLaszlo has to offer.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29c0580.0x2ab85c0"></a>
Installing and Configuring OpenLaszlo</h2></div></div><p>
OpenLaszlo is a Web development platform built on top of release 1.4
of the Java SDK. Packaged as a Java Servlet, OpenLaszlo can be dropped
into any compatible Java Servlet container. The Apache Tomcat server
comes with the OpenLaszlo distribution and is already configured and
ready to go, so I use it in this article. Whether or not you use Tomcat,
it still is necessary to install the Java SDK before attempting to
install OpenLaszlo (assuming it's not already installed). If you are on
a Debian-derived version of GNU/Linux (like me), installing release 1.4
of the SDK is a breeze:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install j2sdk1.4
</pre>
</p><p>
Users of non-Debian distributions should check their package
repositories for the Java SDK and install appropriately. Once the Java
SDK install is complete, edit the /etc/bash.bashrc file as root, adding
the following lines to the end of the file:


<pre     class="programlisting">
export JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/j2se/1.4"
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
</pre>
</p><p>
These lines effectively allow Java programs to find the Java runtime
environment. Be sure to set these environment variables, as without
them, nothing works. With the Java SDK configured, it's time to get
OpenLaszlo. Download the latest compressed tarball from the OpenLaszlo
site (see Resources), then copy it to your /usr/local directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo cp openlaszlo-4.0.10-unix.tar.gz /usr/local
</pre>
</p><p>
At the time of this writing, the latest and greatest OpenLaszlo is release
4.0.10. Be sure to adjust the release number within these instructions
if you're using a newer release. Change directory to /usr/local, and unpack
the distribution:


<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local
sudo tar zxvf openlaszlo-4.0.10-unix.tar.gz 
</pre>
</p><p>
This creates an lps-4.0.10 directory under /usr/local with all the
OpenLaszlo goodies unpacked in place. Of importance is the existence
of the Tomcat server under the newly created Server directory at
lps-4.0.10/Server/tomcat-5.0.24/. To start the server with the OpenLaszlo
servlet preconfigured, type:


<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo /usr/local/lps-4.0.10/Server/tomcat-5.0.24/bin/startup.sh
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29c0580.0x2ab8a38"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which results in the following output:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Using CATALINA_BASE:   /usr/local/lps-4.0.10/Server/tomcat-5.0.24
Using CATALINA_HOME:   /usr/local/lps-4.0.10/Server/tomcat-5.0.24
Using CATALINA_TMPDIR: /usr/local/lps-4.0.10/Server/tomcat-5.0.24/temp
Using JAVA_HOME:       /usr/lib/j2se/1.4
</pre>
</p><p>
Tomcat and Openlaszlo are now up and running on port 8080.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29c0580.0x2ab8c48"></a>
Testing OpenLaszlo</h2></div></div><p>
An OpenLaszlo test page is provided, and you can access it by typing the
following URL into the browser:
http://localhost:8080/lps-4.0.10/examples/hello.lzx.
</p><p>
This results in the string &ldquo;Hello Laszlo!&rdquo; appearing within the browser
after a few seconds. (The first time, OpenLaszlo takes a while to
load, but subsequent reloads are as quick as a flash.) Ask your browser to
view the HTML source, and a perfectly formed page of HTML is displayed,
albeit missing a little human-readable white-space.
</p><p>
The output produced is created by an OpenLaszlo application, written
in a declarative, XML-based programming language called LZX. Here's the
source code to hello.lzx, which is pretty much run-of-the-mill XML:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;canvas&gt; 
    &lt;text&gt;Hello to Linux Journal from Laszlo!&lt;/text&gt;
&lt;/canvas&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
This simple example illustrates an important point about
OpenLaszlo. Openlaszlo's programming language is declarative in nature,
not procedural. What this means is that you specify what you want
OpenLaszlo to do as opposed to specifying how OpenLaszlo is to go about
performing what you want done. OpenLaszlo then works out the series of
steps that need to be performed and performs them for you. (In a way,
this is exactly like how regular expressions work, in that you specify the
pattern you are looking for, not how to find it.) So, when you program
OpenLaszlo, you declare the behaviour you require in LZX, and you write
LZX in XML. Hard-core programming types might think that writing code in
XML is far too unwieldy. But, it's not code per se; it's a declaration
of the desired behaviour. Once you get your head around this idea,
LZX and OpenLaszlo make quite a bit of sense.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29c0580.0x2ab8f60"></a>
Building an OpenLaszlo Application</h2></div></div><p>
The root XML node in all OpenLaszlo applications is the &lt;canvas&gt; tag,
which contains the declarative code that describes the application's
behaviour. To see how all this works, let's play with some LZX code,
building on the simple test application above. Create a file called
ljhello.lzx, and put the following LZX code in it:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;canvas&gt;
  &lt;window title="My First App"
          x="50" y="50"
          height="200" width="500"
          realizable="true"&gt;
    &lt;text id="message"
          text="Hello from Linux Journal!"/&gt;
  &lt;/window&gt;
&lt;/canvas&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Save the file, then copy it to a location where OpenLaszlo and the
Tomcat server can find it:


<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo cp ljhello.lzx /usr/local/lps-4.0.10/Server/lps-4.0.10/
</pre>
</p><p>
Typing http://localhost:8080/lps-4.0.10/ljhello.lzx into a browser results
in the creation of a movable, realizable window, as shown in Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10071f1.large.jpg"><img src="10071f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Our First OpenLaszlo Application: ljhello.lzx
</p></div></div><p>
Referring to the LZX code, it is not too difficult to work out what's
specified for this application. We start with a blank canvas, then
create a window that has a title, an x/y position, height/width values
and the realizable property switched on. Within the window, we ask for
some text, give the text an identifier and an initial value. Note how
the use of indentation within the LZX code helps to 
describe which components of the application are related to which other
components rather naturally. Within the browser, the resulting window can be grabbed and
dragged, as well as resized.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29c0580.0x2ab9430"></a>
OpenLaszlo and Data</h2></div></div><p>
For the purposes of demonstration, let's imagine we have a small on-line
store that wants to provide access to its client list via a nice,
modern Web-based interface. To provide the required functionality, let's
put the data into a MySQL database and provide access to the list via
an OpenLaszlo application.
</p><p>
To begin, log in to the MySQL client as root, then create a database called
store and a MySQL user called store_manager:


<pre     class="programlisting">
mysql&gt; create database store;
mysql&gt; use mysql;
mysql&gt; grant all on store.* to store_manager identified by 'passwordhere';
</pre>
</p><p>
Log in to MySQL as this new user, and create a table to hold the client
list:


<pre     class="programlisting">
mysql -u store_manager -p store

mysql&gt; create table client_details 
       (
	    id int not null auto_increment primary key,
	    name varchar (64) not null,
	    address varchar (255),
	    contact_tel_no varchar (64),
            email_address varchar (64)
       );
</pre>
</p><p>
A small collection of SQL insert statements (formatted to fit this page)
provides us with some data to play with:


<pre     class="programlisting">
mysql&gt; insert into client_details value ( 0,       \
'Joe Bloggs', '25 Somewhere Street, Anytown, USA', \
'00-1-415-555-3226', 'joe@bloggs.com' );
mysql&gt; insert into client_details value ( 0,       \
'Jane Doe', 'Apt. 2a, 16 Treatsville, Canada',     \
'00-1-416-555-1222', 'jane@idontknow.ca' );
mysql&gt; insert into client_details value ( 0,       \
'Harry Smith', 'P.O. Box 46, Streetstown, USA',    \
'00-1-581-555-9823', 'harry@harrysmith.com' );
mysql&gt; insert into client_details value ( 0,       \
'Julie Jones','CharmsRus, BT Tower, London, UK',   \
'00-44-081-555-2398', 'julie@charmsrus.co.uk' );
</pre>
</p><p>
With the database table ready, and some sample data inserted, we next
need to get the data into a format that OpenLaszlo can understand. It
shouldn't surprise you to learn that the best format for your data when
communicating with OpenLaszlo is XML. OpenLaszlo has some rather neat,
built-in functionality for working with XML data. To demonstrate this,
we first have to arrange for MySQL to produce some XML output.
</p><p>
There are a number of ways to do this, and I'm going to write a simple
CGI in Ruby that connects to the database, selects all the data from the
required table and turns it into XML. My program, called get_data.rb,
will execute from Apache's CGI directory, which is /usr/lib/cgi-bin on
my system. Here's the Ruby code I wrote:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#! /usr/bin/ruby 

require 'cgi'
require 'dbi'

resp = CGI.new

puts resp.header( "text/xml" )

dsn =  "DBI:Mysql:store"
user = "store_manager"
pass = "passwordhere"

sql =  "SELECT * FROM client_details"

DBI.connect( dsn, user, pass ) do |dbh|
    rows = dbh.select_all( sql )
    DBI::Utils::XMLFormatter.table( rows, 
                                    "clients", 
                                    "client" )
end
</pre>
</p><p>
This code is straightforward. The key line is the call to
DBI::Utils::XMLFormatter, which takes the result of the SQL query and
produces correctly formatted XML. To see the results, install get_data.rb
into Apache's cgi-bin directory (setting get_data.rb to be executable),
and then type the following into a browser:
http://localhost/cgi-bin/get_data.rb.
Figure 2 shows the XML produced by the get_data.rb CGI script.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10071f2.large.jpg"><img src="10071f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The XML Output Produced by the get_data.rb CGI Script
</p></div></div><p>
To access this data from within an OpenLaszlo application, all that's
required is the appropriate declaration using the LZX dataset tag. Here's
another file, called clients.lzx, which displays the name of each of
the store's clients in an OpenLaszlo window:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;canvas&gt;
  &lt;dataset    src="http://localhost/cgi-bin/get_data.rb" 
              name="dataClients"
              request="true" /&gt;

  &lt;window     title="Client Listing"
              name="top"
              height="300" width="200"
              x="50" y="50"
              realizable="true"&gt;
    &lt;view&gt;
      &lt;text&gt;
        &lt;datapath xpath="dataClients:/clients/client/name/text()"/&gt;
      &lt;/text&gt;
      &lt;simplelayout/&gt;
    &lt;/view&gt;

    &lt;scrollbar/&gt;

  &lt;/window&gt;

&lt;/canvas&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
As in the previous example, there's a window with some text in it. Note
that the text is contained within an LZX view, which combines the text with
something called simplelayout, an in-built OpenLaszlo style
that stacks text one line on top of another. The window, called top,
also has a scrollbar associated with it. The dataset LZX tag informs the
OpenLaszlo application where to get the data from (src), what to call the
dataset (name) and instructs the application to go and get the data as
soon as it is loaded (request). The datapath tag is a standard XML XPath
specification pointing to the dataset that we want to use. In this case,
we want to retrieve the text of the name tag, which is contained within
the inner-enclosing client tag, which is itself contained within the
outer-enclosing clients tag. Referring back to Figure 2, it is easy to
see the data that we are referring to within this XPath specifier.
</p><p>
To try out this application, copy the LZX file to the appropriate
directory on the server (using the same destination directory as for
the ljhello.lzx file), then start the application running within your
browser using the following URL:
http://localhost:8080/lps-4.0.10/clients.lzx.
</p><p>
This produces an OpenLaszlo window with the names of the four clients
displayed within it, as shown in Figure 3.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10071f3.large.jpg"><img src="10071f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29c0580.0x2ab0768"></a>
Adding Interactivity</h2></div></div><p>
Although of interest, this list would be made more useful if a single
click on the client name produced another window within the browser
containing the rest of the client's data. Arranging for this behaviour
is not difficult. The first thing we need to do is provide some
visual feedback to our users as they select a client name from the first
window. Add this code to the window's &lt;text&gt; element:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;handler name="onclick"&gt;
   client_info.datapath.setFromPointer( this.datapath );
&lt;/handler&gt;

&lt;handler name="onmouseover"&gt;
   this.setBGColor( 0xBBBBFF );
&lt;/handler&gt;

&lt;handler name="onmouseout"&gt;
   this.setBGColor( null );
&lt;/handler&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
This snippet of LZX highlights OpenLaszlo's ability to embed JavaScript
within XML elements. What this code instructs the browser to do is to
set the data pointer for something called client_info to the currently
selected datapath once users click a name on the list. It also
changes the background color as users move their mouse over the client
names, providing nice, desktop-like visual feedback. But, what's this
client_info thing, and what does it refer to? It's another OpenLaszlo
window defined with the following LZX code:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;window name="client_info" 
        x="300" y="100"
        width="300" height="200"
        title="Client Specifics"&gt;

  &lt;datapath/&gt;
    &lt;text datapath="../address/text()"
          width="100%" 
          multiline="true" /&gt;
    &lt;text datapath="../contact_tel_no/text()"
          fontsize="16"/&gt;
    &lt;text datapath="../email_address/text()"
          fontsize="14"/&gt;
    &lt;simplelayout/&gt;

&lt;/window&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
This window has its own name and title values, as well as x, y, width
and height values that position it initially to the right of the client
listing window. It also has a datapath tag, together with three text
elements that reference (using an appropriate XPath specification) the
other data elements within our database table. We've specified that the
address uses the entire width of the client_info window and can word
wrap, while the other two pieces of data are displayed in differently
set font sizes. When this LZX application (called clients2.lzx) is loaded
into the browser, the client list appears in the original window, and as
each client name is clicked, the second window refreshes to display the
address, telephone number and e-mail address of the currently selected
client. If you are following along, note how the user receives visual
feedback as each client name is clicked. Figure 4 shows an example,
with one client name highlighted (clicked) and the associated details
appearing in the second window.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10071f4.large.jpg"><img src="10071f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29c0580.0x2ab0b88"></a>
Adding Animation</h2></div></div><p>
Let's finish this example with a bit of fun by adding some LZX
animation effects to our OpenLaszlo application. Specifically, whenever
users click on a client name in the first window, in addition to
refreshing the data, we want the second window to roll up (shrink),
pause, and then roll back down again (grow). To make this work, we need to
wrap the onclick handler code with calls to our animators:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;handler name="onclick"&gt;
  client_info.winShrink.doStart();
  client_info.datapath.setFromPointer( this.datapath );
  client_info.winGrow.doStart();
&lt;/handler&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Specifying animation with LZX involves writing XML. Here's the
shrinking and growing LZX code for this application (which I've called
client3.lzx). This code is added to the second window's XML:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;animatorgroup name="winShrink" 
               start="false" 
               duration="0"&gt;
    &lt;animator attribute="height" to="50"/&gt;
    &lt;animator attribute="height" to="50"/&gt;
&lt;/animatorgroup&gt;

&lt;animatorgroup name="winGrow" 
               start="false" 
               duration="200"&gt;
    &lt;animator attribute="height" to="200"/&gt;
    &lt;animator attribute="height" to="200"/&gt;
&lt;/animatorgroup&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
I define two animatorgroups and give each of them a name. Note how the
animatorgroup name is referenced within the onclick handler, above. Within
each animatorgroup, I provide some timing data (duration) and new
attribute values for the height of the window. When the window shrinks,
the height drops to 50 pixels. When the window grows, the height rises
to 200 pixels. When combined, the visual effect is that of the window
rolling up, pausing, then rolling back down to display the updated client
details. Unfortunately, I can't show this in a screenshot, so you'll
have to try it to see the effect in action (or take my word for it). The
main point, of course, is that the visual effect has been realised without
writing code, per se. All I did was define the behaviour I wanted in LZX.
