Desktop Linux is maturing, and many organizations are taking notice.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1642580.0x173a2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Linux making its way out of the server room and onto the desktop has been
&ldquo;just around the corner&rdquo; for years now. Prognostications of desktop
dominance have not materialized, leaving Linux with a market share in
the low single digits. Nevertheless, Linux is maturing as a desktop
platform for the enterprise and is gaining converts, with a growing number of
companies leveraging Linux to get more features for their money. In this
article, I take a closer look at the latest trends in desktop Linux in
the enterprise, as well as a number of case studies that illustrate how
Linux is fully ready to be a robust desktop platform in many situations.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1642580.0x173a4b8"></a>
Big Trends</h2></div></div><p>
From talking with several people in the industry who promote desktop
Linux to the enterprise for a living, my overall impression is that the
Linux desktop wave is indeed building. Although interesting and significant
implementations exist, more large-scale projects are in the pipeline than
have emerged from it. The people I spoke with pointed to trends, but
they generally could back them up with only a single example or weren't able
to mention the client's name.
</p><p>
Nevertheless, forward movement is occurring for Linux on the enterprise
desktop, and the people on the front lines are bullish. For instance,
Mindy Anderson, Business Manager for Client Strategies at Red Hat,
states that &ldquo;the desktop is working itself into being disruptive in
many industries, including finance, telecommunications and health care&rdquo;.
Meanwhile, Gerry Carr, Marketing Manager at Canonical (commercial
supporter of Ubuntu), adds that &ldquo;we find ourselves at the beginning of a
bell curve, where only a minority of potential clients have deployed,
and we're engaged in talks with the people who are in the big hump of
the curve&rdquo;. Over at Novell, Guy Lunardi, Senior Product Manager of SUSE
Linux Enterprise Desktop, asserts that &ldquo;we're there from a technological
standpoint&rdquo;, and the critical factor that prevents Linux from going
gangbusters, says co-Novellite Michael Applebaum, Product Marketing
Manager for the Desktop, is &ldquo;simply the awareness that desktop Linux is
already a very viable platform&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1642580.0x173a778"></a>
Barrier Removal</h2></div></div><p>
Despite bullishness on the part of Linux vendors, these same companies
admit that they remain in barrier-removal mode. Canonical's Carr
admits that his sales staff continue to confront objections, such as
lack of equivalent Linux-based applications, which often can
be resolved conveniently with solutions like virtualization, but
sometimes, they can't. Novell's Applebaum notes that his firm must further
improve on the interoperability of all ecosystem elements to make them
easier to manage, as well as expand hardware and software certification
so that customers can acquire complete, preloaded desktop solutions.
Although the larger distribution providers, such as Red Hat, Canonical and
Novell, have collaborated with Lenovo, Dell and others to preload and
certify PCs for Linux, the reality is that the hardware vendors offer
fewer options and lack the same hard-sell enthusiasm to hawk Linux.
Even today, you can buy a PC from the Lenovo or Dell's on-line stores and
never realize that Linux is available.
</p><p>
It also is true that Linux providers at last can say that the OS is
intuitive enough for typical office workers who are accustomed to using
Windows. This has not always been the case. Novell should be commended for
its Better Desktop initiative, which applied a scientific methodology
and video capture to examine how real people use Linux, discover its
pitfalls and see how its deficiencies can be removed. The investigators
captured more than 200 videos of people using Linux and its core applications
for everyday tasks. For instance, normal users were examined while
doing everything that is fully routine to us geeks&mdash;logging on to their
system, finding and playing a particular music track, making shortcuts on
the desktop, determining available disk space, sending e-mail and more.
The reports and videos are fascinating and available on the project's
Web site.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1642580.0x173a930"></a>
Drivers to Adoption of Desktop Linux</h2></div></div><p>
Several IT trends are making desktop Linux more attractive to many
organizations. One of these is a growing desire to reduce licensing
costs. Novell's Lunardi notes how its customer, the automaker Peugeot,
decided to cap its number of Microsoft licenses as its workforce grows and
offer Linux desktops to new employees. Another trend is the push toward
accommodating more types of devices, including mobile and thin clients, as
well as allowing users to take their desktops with them wherever they go.
Red Hat's Anderson says that &ldquo;many firms are coming back to a situation
where key workloads are centralized&rdquo;, something that Linux does very well
and securely. Similarly, Novell's Applebaum says that San Diego Public
Schools chose Linux over other operating systems because it offered the
most robust way to run its &ldquo;Always-On Learning Initiative&rdquo;, which included
integrating 100,000 student laptops and many other types of devices.
</p><p>
A third trend involves avoiding Windows Vista drawbacks,
especially the cost of required hardware upgrades and lack of
additional features to justify that cost. Linux, with its smaller
footprint, may find a great deal of growth opportunity from this
situation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1642580.0x173ab40"></a>
Where Linux Is Ready</h2></div></div><p>
The distribution providers are finding several types of workers ready
for desktop Linux. Novell, for example, classifies its target customers
this way:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Office workers&mdash;marketing associates, office
managers, operations managers and insurance agents who rely on a robust
desktop or notebook platform for e-mail, Web browsing, instant messaging,
multimedia applications and office productivity tools. Linux offers cost
savings on hardware requirements, as well as for the OS and applications.
</p></li><li><p>
Transactional workers&mdash;bank sales/service
representatives, call-center representatives and other service
personnel who spend most of their time using a few specialized business
applications, but who also require collaboration applications, such as an
e-mail client and Web browser, and productivity applications, such as a
word processor or spreadsheet.
</p></li><li><p>
Thin-client workers&mdash;companies with mobile workers in multiple
locations who want to keep data consolidated are ideal for thin-client
solutions. Unneeded software and hardware costs can be removed from
the budget. Users can be provided with the right applications when and
where they need them.
</p></li><li><p>
POS workers&mdash;front-line sales and service workers who deal
with customers that need a reliable and user-friendly technology for
enabling transactions. These solutions also could be self-service kiosks.
Linux offers advantages, such as reliability, convenient security patches
and immunity to viruses.
</p></li><li><p>
Technical workstation&mdash;the creative and analytical
workers in an organization who design products, create film animation,
run mathematical models and so on. In these situations, Linux offers the
same reliability as UNIX at a fraction of the cost.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1642580.0x173b010"></a>
Early Adopters</h2></div></div><p>
It's safe to say that the companies already deploying desktop Linux
are early adopters. Gerry Carr of Canonical says that those entities
who already have moved to Linux tend to be smaller organizations &ldquo;that
offer their savvy technical guys lots of autonomy&rdquo;. Another large
share of early-adopter organizations are public entities, which have a
strong mandate for cost-cutting. Recall the fanfare back in 2003 when
the city of Munich, Germany, snubbed Microsoft in favor of deploying
14,000 Linux desktops. Since then, public entities of all sizes have
leveraged Linux for public benefit. For instance, Canonical's most
highly touted implementations range from 150,000 Linux desktops in the
Macedonian public schools and 70,000 in the French National Police,
down to 300 seats in the Howard County (Maryland) Public Library system.
</p><p>
Though many large private companies also have adopted desktop Linux,
more case studies are available overseas than here in the US.
The distribution providers say this is because US-based
firms are more secretive, as they see Linux as a comparative advantage.
Red Hat's Anderson told me &ldquo;I could rattle off names, but you can't
print them&rdquo;. And, although other spokespeople also offered company names off
the record, they remained much less numerous than the overseas examples.
Some larger organizations who openly use desktop Linux include the
French automaker Peugeot (20,000 clients), the Australian affiliate of
Europcar automobile rental, the American firm ECI Telecom (3,000 clients),
Taiwan's Realtek Semiconductor (2,000 clients) and the German insurance
company LVM Versicherungen (8,500 clients).
</p><p>
Arguably the most mature sector for desktop Linux is the corporate
workstation, where the dynamics of the game are a bit different. Although
the absolute number of Linux workstations is not large in real terms,
Linux's share is substantial. HP's David Ramsey, Product Marketing
Manager for Linux workstation software, notes that Linux is well suited
to the task-oriented nature of workstations. Companies with specialized
tasks, such as modeling, forecasting and animations, which historically
have been housed on UNIX workstations, gradually have migrated to the
Linux platform. Ramsey says that HP and others have been especially
successful in industries, such as oil and gas (geological modeling);
finance (real-time data processing); animation studios, such as
DreamWorks and Pixar; and government labs. Mechanical CAD, electronic
design automation and governmental applications in national security are
up-and-coming applications for Linux workstations. Ramsey also added that
expansion of this space often is contingent on application providers
porting their products to Linux, as well as the cost of migration.
&ldquo;The reward must be substantial to do it&rdquo;, he said.

Case Studies of Desktop Linux in the Enterprise</h2></div></div><p>
Replete with context on desktop Linux in the enterprise, let's explore
some interesting, representative case studies. Most case studies here were emphasized by
distribution and solution providers as their most interesting projects.
The implementations are in entities of various sizes in both the private
and public sectors.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1642580.0x173b430"></a>
PSA Peugeot Citroen: Let the User Decide</h2></div></div><p>
PSA Peugeot Citroen, Europe's second-largest automobile manufacturer,
will one day have at least 20,000 of its 72,000 workers running Novell's
SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop. Novell's Guy Lunardi credits Peugeot's
move to Linux on its hard-nosed asset management system that identifies
internal resources, leading its IT managers to question conventional
wisdom and make the best strategic decision for the company. Lunardi also
points out that &ldquo;Novell was able to not only remove technical barriers
that stood in the way of adoption, but it also was able to offer superior
solutions in areas such as VPNs.&rdquo;
</p><p>
One unique facet of the Peugeot project is its organic nature, whereby
users are allowed to choose which desktop they prefer, Linux or
Windows.
The firm is finding most users choose Linux and become Linux
advocates in the process, which further builds internal support for
the OS. Furthermore, most new employees are encouraged to adopt Linux,
which has allowed Peugeot to cap its number of Windows licenses and thus
save on IT costs, despite the additional growth in IT infrastructure.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1642580.0x173b640"></a>
Europcar: Save Money and Still Offer Windows Apps</h2></div></div><p>
Another convert to desktop Linux, in this case Red Hat Enterprise Linux
Desktop, is the auto-rental firm Europcar Asia Pacific. Europcar CIO
Scott Allen explains how he originally looked to desktop Linux &ldquo;to deliver
a fit-for-purpose platform at a reduced price point&rdquo;. Allen added that
this goal has been achieved through significant reduction in licensing
costs and the ability to extend the life of otherwise obsolete hardware.
Europcar has implemented Linux on a variety of different hardware in
its finance department, national call center and branch network, which
spreads across Australia and New Zealand. Allen's team customized
the Red Hat desktop to deliver a simplified interface, offering many
Microsoft Windows applications to users via the Citrix client, as well
as Web browsers natively to the Linux desktop. Using Citrix &ldquo;makes the
solution an overall lower cost option but still a great fit against
business needs&rdquo;, said Allen.
</p><p>
A key factor in Europcar's expanding its Linux usage to the desktop was
quality support. Because the firm had good, long-term experiences with
Red Hat's support for its servers, it felt comfortable diving into the
desktop space too.
</p><p>
Thus far, CIO Allen says, his firm's experiences with desktop Linux have
been very positive. &ldquo;The work done to deliver a customized user interface
was worthwhile and has meant that very little end-user training has been
required.&rdquo; He adds that &ldquo;the only negative&mdash;and it is only a minor one
because of our relationship with Red Hat&mdash;is the availability of Linux
skills in the market. At times it has been difficult to recruit people
with in-depth Linux knowledge.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Allen's advice to firms trying to decide whether to adopt desktop Linux
is to &ldquo;start with the needs of the end user and evaluate Linux desktop
against these needs&rdquo;. He says if users require Windows applications
100% of the time, Linux desktop probably is not the best solution,
even when using something like Citrix. &ldquo;But if your business applications
do not rely on Windows or your users only require part-time access to
Windows applications, I would at least include Linux desktop as an
option to evaluate&rdquo;, he added.

Howard County Library: Linux Saves Public Money</h2></div></div><p>
Though the Howard County Maryland Public Library is not the largest
or most sexy desktop Linux implementation, it was the first example to
proudly roll off the tongue of Canonical's Gerry Carr. In 2006, the library
had 300 aging PCs whose licenses for Windows XP were about to expire.
Realizing it didn't need Windows for its staff and public computers,
it became the first public library system in Maryland to use open source.
When additional machines are needed, the library can purchase used ones
for around $100 that offer the needed functionality. The system estimates
that it saved more than $300,000 of public money by not having to upgrade licenses
and hardware. Monies saved were used to upgrade computers, purchase
software customization and expand library collections. Amy Begg De
Groff, the library's Technology Services Department Head, stated that
&ldquo;Because open-source software is available free or at a very modest cost,
the library can provide public computers at a fraction of the cost using
comparable commercially available software.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1642580.0x173bbc0"></a>
Mosaic: Savings and Security</h2></div></div><p>
As an example from the not-for-profit world, the organization Mosaic is
in the process of implementing Ubuntu Linux thin clients running on the
NoMachine NX Server for its 39 offices in 14 states nationwide. At the
time of
this writing, 13 offices serving 1,900 users have been migrated, with the
remaining offices to migrate by 2009. More than 5,000 employees are projected
to be using the system. Users have access to a full Ubuntu desktop,
which offers OpenOffice.org, Firefox, Mosaic's corporate CRM and Web-based
e-mail applications. Mosaic's two main reasons for switching to Linux
were dramatic cost-savings and security. The organization has re-utilized
older PCs to run as its thin-client terminals, which precluded the
need for large investments in new hardware. Regarding security,
Mosaic is able to keep sensitive data centralized in its data center
to ensure that all data access is controlled and monitored to meet HIPPA
regulations. Wayne Victor, Mosaic's Director of IT Infrastructure, said
that &ldquo;the NX Server is able to handle as many as 100 users per
server.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1642580.0x17325b0"></a>
San Diego Schools: Addressing the Digital Divide</h2></div></div><p>
At 135,000 students, the San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD) is the
country's eighth largest. During each school day, around 100,000 of those
students in grades 3&ndash;12 use a Lenovo R-Series ThinkPad laptop running
SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop provided by the district as a learning tool.
Dubbed the &ldquo;Always-On Learning Initiative&rdquo;, the purpose of the program is
to promote academic success by giving all students access to the tools
they'll need to learn, live and work successfully in the modern world.
The name Always-On comes from the fact that students have access to
a wireless network anywhere and at all times throughout the district.
</p><p>
Choosing Linux over other operating systems offers several advantages
to SDUSD. First, the lower cost of Linux allows SDUSD to reach more
students with fewer resources. By reaching more students, the chronic
problem of a digital divide between wealthier and poorer students can
be addressed. Second, after comparing its options, SDUSD determined that
Linux was easier to scale and support, and more types of devices could
be utilized. Finally, SDUSD sees that providing a laptop to everyone has
great motivational and learning benefits for both teachers and students.
Deputy Superintendent Geno Flores said that &ldquo;students are more interested
in and excited about their classroom work&rdquo; thanks to the program.

Early Adopters Move Linux Forward</h2></div></div><p>
The small sample of case studies above illustrate how Linux is fully
ready to start taking over more desktops in companies, nonprofits and
government offices worldwide. Although we long have been optimistic that
Linux's day of glory would come sooner, our 20/20 hindsight allows us
to grasp that usability and features had to be improved to meet
the needs of most workers. Fortunately, the distribution providers have
realized this fact and invested heavily in removing barriers to Linux
implementation. Certainly, the maturation of virtualization has helped
as well. In addition, the early adopters, whose stories are told here,
have helped all of us by implementing Linux despite some unknowns and
moved it forward. Now, more-conservative organizations can observe these
examples and learn from their experiences, both positive and negative.
So our thanks go out to Peugeot, Europcar, Howard County Library, Mosaic,
San Diego Schools and the other desktop Linux pioneers for implementing
Linux on a large scale and helping make it better. In a few years,
you should be able to look back and be amazed at what you started.
