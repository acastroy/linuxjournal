Your data under your control&mdash;a step toward freedom in the cloud.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187c580.0x19742a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
ownCloud (currently ownCloud 3, <a href="http://owncloud.org/discover" target="_self">owncloud.org/discover</a>) helps
you store your files on a computer under your control and access them
yourself or share with anyone else. Besides storing files, you also can
use ownCloud's calendar to keep track of important events and
meetings, maintain and sync your contacts using CalDAV and stream your
music via its built-in Ampache server. To start using ownCloud, all you
need is a basic Web server (Apache, in this article) installation with
PHP5. Let's get started.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187c580.0x19744b8"></a>
Installation and Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
You want your ownCloud to be truly your own, so you will want ownCloud
running straight out of your home computer. Let's see how.
</p><p>
At the time of this writing, you easily can install ownCloud in Ubuntu via a simple
<tt  >sudo apt-get owncloud</tt>. On Fedora 16, the installation is
a little involved, as an ownCloud package is not yet available. You can
grab this installation script from <a href="https://gist.github.com/2341191" target="_self">https://gist.github.com/2341191</a>, which
I created so you wouldn't need to type each of the steps, and you can see
what is going on in the script by following this blog post entry:
<a href="http://echorand.me/2012/02/26/owncloud-boxgrinder-pagekite-owncloud-appliance" target="_self">echorand.me/2012/02/26/owncloud-boxgrinder-pagekite-owncloud-appliance</a>.
(It also installs MySQL server and configures it; comment the
relevant lines if you want to use SQLite with ownCloud.) A key point
to note in the script is giving appropriate permissions to the owncloud
directory so that the Web server can read/write from/to it.
</p><p>
To check if everything has been set up properly, open your browser
and type in the following URL: http://localhost/owncloud. If you see the
screen shown in Figure 1, your ownCloud installation has been completed.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11237f1.large.jpg"><img src="11237f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. ownCloud: the First Sighting
</p></div></div><p>
As you can see on the screen, you first need to
create an admin account for ownCloud, and specify the directory
where files will be stored and the database to use. Let's use the
default directory, which is /var/www/html/owncloud/files, and
/var/lib/owncloud/data, in the case of Ubuntu. Let's also use
the SQLite database instead of MySQL, but you can choose either one. Once
you click the Finish Setup button, the ownCloud home page appears
where you will see a sidebar with the following contents: Files, Music,
Contacts, Calendar and Gallery. 
</p><p>
You
can create a new file or a folder on this page from the New
tab (Figure 2). By default, there is a maximum size limit (2MB)
of files you can upload (which is really a PHP-imposed limit and not
an ownCloud one). You can change it to something more desirable, say 50MB, by
changing the variables: <tt  >upload_max_filesize=50M</tt>
and <tt  >post_max_size=100M</tt> in the file php.ini
(the location of which will depend on your distribution and may
be found using <tt  >$locate php.ini</tt>; on Fedora 16, it is
/etc/php.ini). Restart your Web server, and your file upload
limits will be changed.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11237f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. User Home
</p></div></div><p>
Now, create a few files and directories. 
Mine at this point in time look like those shown in Figure 3.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11237f3.large.jpg"><img src="11237f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Files and Directories
</p></div></div><p>
If you have other installation requirements, such
as running it off a virtual appliance, refer to
<a href="http://owncloud.org/support/setup-and-installation" target="_self">owncloud.org/support/setup-and-installation</a> for more
information. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187c580.0x1974fb8"></a>
Exploring ownCloud</h2></div></div><p>
One thing you could use ownCloud for is to share your files
with others&mdash;other users on your ownCloud installation or via
a publicly accessible URL. Figure 4 shows how. When you share
a file with another user, it shows up in his or her Shared
directory. (The Shared directory is special in the sense that you cannot
upload/create files/directories in it. It will show only the ones that
have been shared with you by another user.) It seems that you either
can have a publicly accessible URL or share it with another user, but not
both (that's sensible, if you ask me).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11237f4.large.jpg"><img src="11237f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Sharing a File
with Other Users Publicly
</p></div></div><p>
There also is a built-in pdfjs-based PDF viewer, which works quite
well. For example, Figure 5 shows a previous issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> viewed from my ownCloud installation. Mozilla Firefox had some
issues rendering the PDF file, whereas Google Chrome worked perfectly
(bug report: <a href="http://bugs.owncloud.org/thebuggenie/owncloud/issues/oc-442" target="_self">bugs.owncloud.org/thebuggenie/owncloud/issues/oc-442</a>).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11237f5.large.jpg"><img src="11237f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. PDF Viewer
</p></div></div><p>
The Music section scans your directories/files and displays them (Figure
6). You can create a playlist from the files and play it in your browser,
and use an Ampache client to play them either on your local machine,
a remote computer or your Android phone (the Ampache.net client
worked perfectly for me). Quickplay (<a href="http://quickplay.ampache.org" target="_self">quickplay.ampache.org</a>)
is an easy-to-use program for playing music from an Ampache server (Figure 7).

Figure 7. Quickplay
</p></div></div><p>
The Ampache address is http://localhost/owncloud/apps/media/, and the user name
is your ownCloud user name, and the password/API key is your ownCloud password.
</p><p>
The Contacts and Calendar sections can be used to create, view and maintain
contacts and calendars (Figures 8 and 9). As you can see, I have friends in high
places and need to be reminded of a shutdown. You can have multiple address books and multiple calendars, download
them and share them in standard formats and protocols.

</p></div></div><p>
If you have uploaded any image files in any of your directories, the Gallery
section will show them. It's not my intention to show off my photography skills,
but Figure 10 shows some of the photographs I've uploaded into my
directories.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11237f10.large.jpg"><img src="11237f10.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

That pretty much sums up the basic usage scenarios for ownCloud. Now, let's go a little deeper.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187c580.0x1d6e288"></a>
ownCloud Settings and Administration</h2></div></div><p>
The settings section toward the bottom left of your ownCloud home page has four
major sections: Personal, Users, Apps, Log and Admin (Figure 11). Note that you
will see all these sections only when you are the admin user. Other users see only
the Personal section.
</p><p>
In the Personal section, you can set the e-mail address for password recovery,
your language, timezone and also view the WebDAV, CardDAV, CalDAV and Ampache
addresses (Figure 12).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11237f11.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 11. Settings
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11237f12.large.jpg"><img src="11237f12.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 12. Settings: Personal
</p></div></div><p>
You can use WebDAV to view your files without logging in to the ownCloud
installation by using the URL shown to you using browser-based authentication.
You also could hook up your operating system's file manager to create an entry
pointing to your ownCloud files (<a href="http://owncloud.org/support/webdav" target="_self">owncloud.org/support/webdav</a>).
</p><p>
If you are looking for a command-line way to access/retrieve your files, Cadaver
(<a href="http://www.webdav.org/cadaver" target="_self">www.webdav.org/cadaver</a>) is a command-line WebDAV client and can be used
to store and retrieve your files from ownCloud. It can be installed using
either apt-get or yum. Once you have it installed:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$cadaver http://localhost/owncloud/files/webdav.php

Authentication required for ownCloud on server `localhost':
Username: admin
Password: 
dav:/owncloud/files/webdav.php/&gt; 
</pre>
</p><p>
The interface to Cadaver is similar to that provided by an FTP client, with
commands like <tt  >put</tt> for uploading files and
<tt  >get</tt> for downloading files. (I faced
problems with getting Cadaver to work on my Fedora server installation, although
on my Debian and Ubuntu installations it worked great.)
</p><p>
In the Users section, you can add new users and groups and assign
them disk usage quotas (Figure 13). This is useful when your ownCloud
installation will be used by someone other than yourself.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11237f13.large.jpg"><img src="11237f13.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 13. Settings: User
</p></div></div><p>
Use the Log section to see information if something isn't 
happening the way you would expect. The Admin section doesn't
have much in it. The only thing you can do here is export your ownCloud
installation: user files, system files and configuration as a .zip
file (Figure 14). This zip file backs up the ownCloud directory, and you
then can use it to replicate or replace your ownCloud installation elsewhere.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11237f14.large.jpg"><img src="11237f14.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 14. Settings: Export
</p></div></div><p>
ownCloud apps are a way to extend ownCloud's functionality. In fact, the
Calendar, Contacts, Gallery and Media server are all implemented as ownCloud
apps. In the Apps section under Settings, you can see the currently
installed apps and others available for install. More applications are
available at <a href="http://apps.owncloud.com" target="_self">apps.owncloud.com</a>. However, a number of them seem
quite rough and unstable at this time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187c580.0x1d6ef40"></a>
Accessing Your ownCloud and a Step toward
Freedom in the Cloud</h2></div></div><p>
On the face of it, ownCloud is just an open-source solution allowing
you to store your own files where you please. With a little thought, 
it becomes apparent that it helps you take one step ahead in the fight
not to give up your data to services where it may not be very
safe. However, to become really useful, you should be able to access
your data from places outside your home/office/college network. This
is where services like PageKite (<a href="http://pagekite.net" target="_self">pagekite.net</a>) make the
goal
of having your own storage service running off your desktop computer or
laptop a practical reality.
</p><p>
If you have used the installation script for Fedora, you already
will have PageKite installed. Otherwise, follow the one-line
installation process: <tt  >curl -s https://pagekite.net/pk/ |sudo
bash</tt>.
</p><p>
Once that is done, set up PageKite: <tt  >pagekit.py --s signup</tt>, and
follow the steps. Once the signup is done, set up your kite using
<tt  >$pagekit.py 80 &lt;yourname&gt;.pagekite.me</tt> (assuming you are
running Apache on port 80). Your ownCloud service now will be accessible
at http://&lt;yourname&gt;.pagekite.me.

Ending Notes</h2></div></div><p>
ownCloud is a good experience and provides basic
functionalities flawlessly. However, there still are some rough edges
(<a href="http://bugs.owncloud.org/thebuggenie/owncloud/issues/open" target="_self">bugs.owncloud.org/thebuggenie/owncloud/issues/open</a>), 
which gradually should be fixed as ownCloud starts welcoming 
enterprise customers (<a href="http://owncloud.com" target="_self">owncloud.com</a>). Besides, if there
isn't something you want, you can venture into writing your own app:
<a href="http://owncloud.org/dev/writing-apps" target="_self">owncloud.org/dev/writing-apps</a>. An official desktop app for
ownCloud is not fully there yet, except for the Mirall Project for
OpenSUSE (<a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Mirall" target="_self">en.opensuse.org/Mirall</a>), and a basic Android client is
available from <a href="http://owncloud.org/support/android" target="_self">owncloud.org/support/android</a>. It's functional,
but nothing fancy.
</p><p>
Have fun building your own cloud storage from your desktop for yourself,
your friends and your colleagues.

Acknowledgements</h2></div></div><p>
Credit is due to the ownCloud folks for an interesting project, to Bjarni of
Pagekite.net and the awesome Shutter tool (<a href="http://shutter-project.org" target="_self">shutter-project.org</a>)
for helping me create the screenshots for this article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187c580.0x1d6f6d0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>ownCloud 4</b></p><p>
As we go to press, ownCloud 4 was released, boasting a number of new
features, such as the versioning app that adds basic version-control-like
features for your files, the encryption app to store your files in
encrypted form and the Drag and Drop Upload facility. Installation
is basically the same as with ownCloud 3, and you can use a
slight modification of the shell script provided with this article
to try it out (on Fedora). The modified shell script is available at
<a href="https://gist.github.com/2770050" target="_self">https://gist.github.com/2770050</a>. When you start your ownCloud instance
and run into error messages, such as &ldquo;Cannot modify header
information&rdquo;,
simply go to the relevant PHP file mentioned in the error message and
look for an extra new line at the end and remove it for an error-free
installation. In my case (on Fedora 16), it was the
file /var/www/html/owncloud/apps/files_odfviewer/appinfo/app.php (I
haven't yet investigated the exact cause of the error).
