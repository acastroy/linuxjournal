Android (and therefore Linux) is winning the smartphone war, at least in terms
of market share. Eric Raymond has been charting Android progress with great
care during the past several years, and he noted in April 2012 that Android has moved
into the majority position, breaking past 50%, according to comScore data.
(You can keep up at this link: <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/comscore" target="_self">www.catb.org/esr/comscore</a>.)
</p><p>
ESR's chart shows that the smartphone war is now between just two OSes. Only
Android and Apple are on the increase, with Apple breaking past 30% (though
gaining on a lower slope than Android). All the other OSes are, as telecom
maven Tomi Ahonen says, going over a cliff
(<a href="http://www.brightsideofnews.com/news/2012/4/3/introducing-the-cliff-theory-how-handset-makers-die.aspx" target="_self">www.brightsideofnews.com/news/2012/4/3/introducing-the-cliff-theory-how-handset-makers-die.aspx</a>). Microsoft is in the single digits
and dropping, and RIM announced in April that it was dropping out of the
consumer marketplace. That's a death rattle, without the sincerity.
</p><p>
History happens fast in the smartphone marketplace. It's amazing to think that
the smartphone as we know it today was born only four years ago, when Apple
began distributing apps through the iTunes Store and the first Android phones
appeared.
</p><p>
Smartphones are two things. On the smart side, they are whatever we make of
them, using any of the countless apps that run on them. They can be magazines,
flashlights, maps, seismographs, GPSes, cameras, calendars, games,
televisions or whatever. On the phone side, they are still, well, phones.
Nearly all of them are bought with contracts that tie them to a phone company.
Each has its own phone number and its own billing plans for voice, data and
text. In terms of form and status, smart is the adjective and phone is the
noun.
</p><p>
So, even though talking to other people in real time on a handset no longer
requires phone companies (witness the success of Skype, GoToMeeting and the
rest), our phones are still very much tied to phone systems. To a degree that
should make us uncomfortable, our mobile networked world is one contained and
controlled by our relationships with phone companies.
</p><p>
What those companies want most these days is to get into the TV distribution
business. That is, they want to move TV &ldquo;content&rdquo; over their mobile networks,
onto phones and tablets. Given that TV always has had a huge share of the time
we spend staring at glowing rectangles, companies like Verizon can't wait to
turn their well-oiled billing machinery loose on TV viewing over handhelds on
mobile phone networks.
</p><p>
On March 30, 2012, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></span> reported that Verizon CEO Lowell C.
McAdam said the company would have a cable-like video service going by the end
of the year, if regulators approve a $3.9 billion deal to acquire spectrum
from cable companies. Says the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Journal</em></span>, &ldquo;Serving up TV shows and movies on
mobile devices&mdash;and getting paid for it&mdash;has been a long-held dream for
the wireless industry. With the introduction of next-generation high-speed
wireless networks and big-screen devices like Apple Inc.'s latest iPad,
ubiquitous mobile video seems closer than ever.&rdquo; McAdams also said,
&ldquo;We are
willing to do an &agrave; la carte approach here.&rdquo; This is from a company that
weighs (and bills) every bit, minute and text. Billing for &agrave; la carte
&ldquo;content&rdquo; will be a piece of cake.
</p><p>
While the deal as it's laid out still will require users to have a cable TV
subscription, it's also clear that moving TV onto mobile devices is the
long-term strategy here, not only for Verizon, but for the other major
carriers as well. The setting for this game isn't the open marketplace, where
the infrastructure that matters is the Internet, and where PCs and servers can
still operate in relative freedom. This game happens in a regulatory space
where the biggest weapons are licenses, patents, money and lobbying clout.
</p><p>
The stakes are very high. For example, it's clear that Google paid $12.5
billion to secure Motorola's patent portfolio, not because Google wanted to
compete with all the other Android OEMs. Apple, Google, Samsung and others
have been caught up in various patent disputes over mobile stuff, and
Microsoft recently bought AOL's patents (including many inherited from
Netscape) for $1.1 billion. Living in the patented world is not a
Linux-lover's fantasy. But the patented world is a better description of the mobile
data environment than of the old home- and office-based Internet.
</p><p>
PCs and the Internet both grew to ubiquity thanks in large measure to the
absence of regulatory, licensing and intellectual property burdens. Thanks to
the same absent burdens, Linux experts today are in far more demand than the
market can supply.
</p><p>
Yet, as smartphones morph into smartTVs, the openness of Android will take a
backseat to whatever deals the carriers and the device-makers do with the
&ldquo;content providers&rdquo; in Hollywood and New York.
</p><p>
In Silicon Valley, Google announced in January 2012 that it was investing $100
million in original programming for YouTube. While that's nice in the sense
that it's for distribution over the Net rather than through cable or new
cable-like mobile telephony systems, we're still talking about TV.
</p><p>
Can we move past that? Maybe we're there already, just given all the other
apps a smartphone can run. But I'm not sure. Again, the smartphone business is
still very young. If smartphones evolve into smartTVs that also happen to run
a lot of apps, is that a good thing?
</p><p>
Whether or not it is, I don't think we should settle for it.
