Even if you're not a designer, Bootstrap is a great way to make your sites
look nice.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbf0580.0xce8358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my last article, I described the relatively new phenomenon of design
frameworks. Just as Web application frameworks make it easier to
create server-side applications, design frameworks make it easier to
create client-side designs. They do this by providing predefined CSS
classes, each of which indicates the width of the column you want to
create, the type of element you're using, or the color and style you
want to use.
</p><p>
It's true that CSS masters will find a design framework
unnecessary. After all, such people already can tweak the layouts,
adjust the colors or create beautiful buttons, all on their own,
without having to use the assistance of predefined classes. But
speaking as someone who is design-challenged, the introduction of
design frameworks has made it possible, even for someone like me,
to make a Web application that doesn't cause people to go screaming
into the night.
</p><p>
The secret behind such frameworks is that by buying into their
predefined CSS classes, you give up some of the freedom you had
with pure CSS. You agree to use their classes and to use their HTML
structure in some cases. This is generally a worthwhile trade-off, in
that your code and CSS end up being much shorter and more legible.
You can concentrate on your domain of expertise, namely software
development, rather than tweaking the CSS to look just right. And,
because these frameworks constantly are evolving to support designers
and developers, each upgrade supports more browsers, more
optimizations and more CSS classes that you can use to integrate into
your work.
</p><p>
One framework in particular has taken the world of Web development by
storm during the past year: Twitter Bootstrap. Bootstrap first
was released in summer 2011, and it was written by Mark Otto and
Jacob Thornton, both of whom work at Twitter. Bootstrap, which was
released under an open-source license on GitHub, has become an
almost-overnight sensation. Indeed, it is currently the most-watched
open-source project on GitHub, surpassing even Ruby on Rails.
</p><p>
There have been grumblings on such sites as Y Combinator's &ldquo;Hacker
News&rdquo; about the proliferation of sites using Twitter Bootstrap. I see
this as positive, raising the minimum acceptable level for Web design,
while also making it straightforward and easy for designers to extend
those designs.
</p><p>
Bootstrap is based on LESS, a language that compiles into CSS, and
which is similar in many ways to SCSS. This means if you want to
work with Bootstrap, you either need to compile the LESS
stylesheets into CSS manually, take care of this in your deployment system or
use a precompiled version of Bootstrap. Although using a precompiled
version of Bootstrap is clearly the easiest way to go, it also gives
you the least flexibility, because you won't be able to modify the LESS
source to your own designs.
</p><p>
In this article, I discuss Bootstrap, including how you can integrate
it into your own Web applications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbf0580.0xce87d0"></a>
Installing Bootstrap</h2></div></div><p>
There are several ways to install Twitter Bootstrap. The easiest and
most straightforward is to clone the Git repository from GitHub:

<pre     class="programlisting">
git clone https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap.git
</pre>
</p><p>
This creates a new subdirectory named bootstrap, containing a
number of files and directories. The docs directory contains the
current documentation, the same as you can see on the Bootstrap site
itself on GitHub. And, because it is written using Bootstrap, it
provides a nice set of examples for using Bootstrap on your own sites.
</p><p>
I discuss the img directory below, so for now, you largely
can ignore it. The js directory contains jQuery plugins that integrate
with Bootstrap. The less directory contains, as you might expect, a
number of files in LESS format, which then can be compiled into CSS
files. It is these resulting CSS files that you will use on your
site, not the LESS source files.
</p><p>
Now, how do you compile the LESS files into CSS? One way is to
install and run the LESS compiler yourself. LESS is implemented in
JavaScript, which means that it either can run in the browser or&mdash;in
the case I'm describing&mdash;on the server, in a browserless
implementation of JavaScript, such as Rhino or node.js. (It's true
that earlier versions of LESS were implemented in Ruby, but that has
not been true for some time, so be sure to use the JavaScript
version.) I decided to upgrade node.js on my server by downloading
the source and installing it from scratch with this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make check &amp;&amp; make install

</pre>
</p><p>
Once this was done, I had not only the &ldquo;node&rdquo; binary, but also the
&ldquo;npm&rdquo; binary, which allows me to install packages for node.js.
You can
install LESS with the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
npm install less
</pre>
</p><p>
Once that's done, you should be able to go into the less directory
and issue the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
lessc bootstrap.less &gt; bootstrap.css
</pre>
</p><p>
This compiles bootstrap.less into CSS, which you capture into the
file bootstrap.css.
</p><p>
Some Web application frameworks can perform this compilation for you
behind the scenes, on a regular basis or as you deploy. It's worth
searching through the documentation for your favorite application
framework. Bootstrap has become so popular that nearly every major
one supports it somehow.
</p><p>
Now, if this seems like a lot of work just to get started with LESS,
you're right. And in general, you probably won't want to start
off adjusting the source LESS files, but rather just playing with the
resulting CSS classes and other goodies Bootstrap provides. To
do that, you simply can take a snapshot of the compiled CSS files
created by LESS. One quick-and-dirty way to do this is to grab the
CSS file that came with the Bootstrap documentation; although you won't
be able to change things in the LESS source, it's good enough for
beginning purposes. Just look in docs/assets/css/bootstrap.css, and
copy that into your Web project.
</p><p>
A middle ground, which allows you to customize things easily but
doesn't require that you install and use the LESS compiler each time,
is to use the Bootstrap configure-and-download functionality, from the
Bootstrap home page. Enter the colors and basic design paradigms you
want to use, and you'll get a custom CSS file delivered to your
browser.
</p><p>
Finally, it's possible to run LESS in the browser, because (as I
indicated above) it's written in JavaScript. However, I've generally
found this to be a less acceptable way to go about things, if only
because it's so much slower, and of course, I'll always want to use
it on the server, so I generally get things going there instead.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbf0580.0xce8eb0"></a>
Using Bootstrap</h2></div></div><p>
In every case except for the in-browser LESS compiler, you always
will end up with a CSS file, typically named bootstrap.css. This file
should be placed, not surprisingly, alongside your other CSS files,
and then incorporated into your HTML file in the standard way:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;link href="/bootstrap.css" media="all" 
 &#8618;rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
If you fire up your HTML file with just that, you'll see...well,
almost nothing. A little bit has changed, namely the default fonts
and margins (which probably have disappeared). But for the most
part, you really haven't changed anything, and there aren't any obvious
benefits. That's because Bootstrap is an &agrave; la carte system, in which
you can take any or all of it, depending on your interests and needs.
</p><p>
That said, one thing that you'll almost certainly want to do is add a
div tag with the &ldquo;container&rdquo; class immediately within your body tag,
as follows:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;ATF&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link href="bootstrap.css" media="all" rel="stylesheet"
     &#8618;type="text/css" /&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Body&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Body 2
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Thing One&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Thing Two&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Thing Three&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
If your system is like mine, you'll see that the contents have shifted
over to the right, with a large left-hand margin. Actually, the size
of the margin depends on the width of your browser. By using a div
within the body, the width of that div can stay relatively stable, even
as the browser width changes around it.
</p><p>
Now, things truly become interesting when you start to divide your file
into separate rows. You see, Twitter Bootstrap provides you with a
grid&mdash;meaning that you divide your text into rows, and that each row
consists of content, each of which consumes a certain number of
columns. Bootstrap uses a 12-column grid, meaning that within any
row, you can mix and match text using any combination of 12
columns.
You indicate how many columns wide something should be by assigning a
class of &ldquo;spanN&rdquo; to your HTML element, where N is a number between 1
and 12, inclusive.
</p><p>
For example, you can have a wide paragraph as follows:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;p class="span12"&gt;Wide paragraph. Very wide paragraph. 
    Super-duper wide paragraph. Fill the screen's width paragraph.
    Use lots of text to fill the screen's width paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
Or, you can have four narrow columns:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;p class="span3"&gt;Narrow paragraph. Narrow paragraph. Narrow
    paragraph. Narrow paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="span3"&gt;Narrow paragraph. Narrow paragraph. Narrow
    paragraph. Narrow paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="span3"&gt;Narrow paragraph. Narrow paragraph. Narrow
    paragraph. Narrow paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="span3"&gt;Narrow paragraph. Narrow paragraph. Narrow
    paragraph. Narrow paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Or, even a left-hand sidebar, with main text on the right:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;p class="span2"&gt;Sidebar. Sidebar. Sidebar. Sidebar.
  Sidebar. Sidebar. Sidebar. Sidebar. Sidebar. Sidebar.
  Sidebar. Sidebar. Sidebar. Sidebar. Sidebar. Sidebar.
  Sidebar. Sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="span10"&gt;Main text. Main text. Main text. Main
  text. Main text. Main text. Main text. Main text. Main
  text. Main text. Main text. Main text. Main text. Main
  text. Main text. Main text. Main text. Main text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Now, it's true that these class names lack any semantic value, and they are
in some ways a new-fangled technique for doing tables&mdash;which, as all of us
know, are a terrible non-CSS way to do layout. But, the advantages are
huge. I know that these classes have made it far easier for me to
experiment with layouts, moving text to different places on the page,
and understanding what will happen to the rest of the items on my page
when I do so.
</p><p>
Now, Bootstrap provides a number of classes that are not meant to be
used on their own, but rather in conjunction with other classes. For
example, you always can have a title that uses the h1 tag, but perhaps
you really want the h1 to stick out on your home page. To do that,
just add the &ldquo;hero-unit&rdquo; class to your h1's list of classes. The fact
that each tag may contain any number of classes makes it trivially
easy to add and remove design styles from Bootstrap and to experiment
with what different ones will look like.
</p><p>
Now, it's true that h1, h2 and their friends get styled nicely by
default when you use Bootstrap, setting not only the font size and
boldface but also the line height. But, you can make them even
snazzier than the defaults, by (you guessed it) using some of
Bootstrap's classes. If your h1 is the page header, you can
enclose it in a div whose class is &ldquo;page-header&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Non-headlined text can enjoy some treats too. If you want some text,
such as a glossary definition, to appear when the user's mouse cursor
hovers over it, just wrap the text in an &ldquo;abbr&rdquo; tag:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;abbr title="GNU'S Not Unix!"&gt;GNU&lt;/abbr&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Text with such an abbr tag has a light underline beneath it, which
allows users to identify such text more easily.
</p><p>
Tables get some fancy styling as well. By using the table-striped
class, you automatically can have alternate rows contain a light
background color to distinguish them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbf0580.0xce99b0"></a>
Forms</h2></div></div><p>
Bootstrap also has strong support for HTML forms. Like all other
block-level elements, the &ldquo;form&rdquo; tag can take a
&ldquo;spanN&rdquo; class,
indicating its width. But the form itself will look much spiffier
than would be the case without Bootstrap. Text fields are sized
appropriately and get a nice shadow when they receive the input
focus. Submit buttons have nicely rounded corners, and the mouse
cursor changes to a pointer when hovering over them.
</p><p>
But wait, it gets better. Let's say you want your submit button
to be a bit larger than usual. Well, just add the &ldquo;btn-large&rdquo;
class to the &ldquo;input&rdquo; tag, and you'll have a larger button. You 
also can use btn-small or btn-mini for buttons of other sizes.
</p><p>
You also can colorize your buttons by setting additional classes. The
&ldquo;btn-primary&rdquo; class will use Bootstrap's primary color (blue, by
default). But, instead you can use &ldquo;btn-danger&rdquo; (for red),
&ldquo;btn-warning&rdquo; (for yellow) and a host of other colors. In this way,
Bootstrap is using CSS classes semantically. I find it very useful to
be able to think in terms of what the buttons are for, rather than
what color they contain. The levels and colors are consistent across
Bootstrap as well. If you put text within a span or div with both the
&ldquo;label&rdquo; and &ldquo;label-warning&rdquo; classes, or the
&ldquo;badge&rdquo; and
&ldquo;badge-warning&rdquo; classes, the text will be highlighted with the warning
color. You also can have button groups, labeling of check boxes and
radio buttons (so people can click on the text, not just the
widget), and many other features.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbf0580.0x10e2180"></a>
Navbars and Icons</h2></div></div><p>
If you want your site to have a simple navigation bar, you can avoid
creating the HTML and CSS necessary for such a thing to work, and just
use Bootstrap's &ldquo;navbar&rdquo; class. Whether you want a simple navbar, one with
pop-up, JavaScript-controlled buttons or even a form inside your
navbar, Bootstrap has all of those options available. You even can set
up your navbar such that it's &ldquo;responsive&rdquo;&mdash;meaning that it knows how to
expand and collapse based on the user's browser window width.
</p><p>
The &ldquo;img&rdquo; directory contains two images: one for all of the
white-on-black icons that Bootstrap provides and another for all of
the black-on-white versions of those same icons. The icons are all on
one image, because they take advantage of CSS sprites, a technique
that makes it possible for your browser to download a single image and
then selectively display parts of that image independently. Thus, if
you have a download link on your site and you want to have a download icon,
you can add:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class="icon-download"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Download&lt;/p&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Now, here's the thing you might notice about the icons: they're
using the &lt;i&gt; tag, which normally is for italics. But, the text that
accompanies the icon doesn't go inside the tag. Rather, it goes
next to the tag. The only reason for &lt;i&gt; is that it allows CSS to
pull up a sprite as the background image. The icons are a great start
for many of the things you'll want on a site.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I've been doing Web development for a while and thought I had
seen rapid adoption of technologies before. But, Twitter Bootstrap
has beaten them all from what I can tell. It's popular, of very high
quality, adheres to standards, works across platforms and languages,
and is easy to use.
</p><p>
The only negative I can think of is fairly minor&mdash;namely that it
uses LESS rather than SCSS, which means that integration is a tiny bit
more complex with Ruby on Rails. But, even that integration is a
no-brainer. Ruby gems exist that solve this problem in a number of
different ways.
</p><p>
I've adopted Bootstrap in my own work and expect to adopt it on
future projects as well. Bootstrap doesn't solve all the problems
with CSS, but it solves so many of them and makes them so accessible,
that it allows even someone like me to create an attractive site. And,
after years of having to give excuses when my simple, prototype sites
didn't look very attractive, I now have a way to ensure that they'll
at least be minimally aesthetically pleasing.
