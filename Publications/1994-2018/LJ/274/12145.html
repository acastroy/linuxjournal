It doesn't take more than a glance at the current headlines to see data
security is a vital part of almost everything we do. Whether it's concern
over election hacking or user accounts being publicized after a website
compromise, our data integrity is more important than ever. Although there's
little we can do individually to stop hackers from attacking websites we
don't personally control, we always can be more conscious of how we manage
our data and credentials for our own accounts. As is becoming more and more
common, this month, we look at a lot of security issues.

</p><p>
Although not exactly security-related, Dave Taylor starts off on another
scripting quest. We've been learning how to land on Mars, but this
month, we look at how to play rock scissors paper with the command line. It
sounds like a simple endeavor, but the programmatic side can become
complicated quickly. As is always the case with Dave's column, the
objective is fun, but the learning experience along the way is priceless.
</p><p>
This month, Kyle Rankin helps us all sleep a little better at night&mdash;not
due to better security measures, but rather by helping us configure on-call
alerts. Being woken up at 3am because a bird flew into the server room
window is not a great way to catch 40 winks. Kyle shows how to avoid
false positives, but also how to make more intelligent alerts in general.
Because servers seldom misbehave during regular business hours, his column is
invaluable.
</p><p>
A while back I wrote an article on how to pick smart passwords. I think it
was only last year, but in IT time, that was eons ago. Thanks to a recent
attempt at compromising my cell phone, security has been on the top of my
list recently. Kyle Rankin helped me identify some ways to secure my
identity, and I figured it was a good time to elaborate on some general
tips on how to keep your credentials and accounts safe. Also, for the
record, it's incredibly awesome to have Kyle as a personal friend&mdash;just
saying.

Susan Sons teaches us to learn from our mistakes and avoid repeating
unpleasant history. Specifically, she explains how to go about doing a
postmortem on a security issue. Whether it's a practice run, a server-level
compromise or even leaked account credentials, the lessons we learn from
past problems are only as good as how detailed our postmortem procedures
are. Thankfully, Susan is willing to share her expertise, and we can all
benefit.
</p><p>
We go into a fairly scary world with Ash Wilson this month. It wasn't very
long ago that cellular data services were rather difficult to attack. We've
all been conditioned not to trust open Wi-Fi networks, but the cellular
connection on our mobile devices isn't something most of us think about.
Those times are changing, and Ash helps us learn to detect
man-in-the-middle attacks on cellular networks. If you use a mobile device
(and if you're reading <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, we all know you are), this article
will both inform and scare you. I know it did me!
</p><p>
And finally, Todd A. Jacobs provides a great look into the current DevOps
world with his article on managing Docker instances with Puppet. In one of
those peanut-butter-in-my-chocolate situations, combining multiple DevOps
tools tends to make something better than the sum of its parts. This
article builds on Todd's December 2016 article about provisioning Docker with
Puppet, and here he describes how to manage Docker images and containers. 
</p><p>
This issue certainly has a lot of security-related content, which is great
if you live in the current data-centric world. Thankfully, it also contains
other tech tips, product announcements and insight on our current
technology-rich world. Whether you're looking for a way to deploy a more
secure application or just want to learn about the latest cool mobile
game, this issue should do the trick. Enjoy!
