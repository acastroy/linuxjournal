How to: using Salt Stack to install and configure software on
multiple servers at once.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0xdb31f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I was proudly wearing one of my Salt Stack shirts the other day when my daughter
asked me, &ldquo;What is Salt Stack?&rdquo;
I began by explaining the problem it solved.
If you have multiple servers and want to do things to those servers, you
would need to log in to each one and do those things one at a time on each one.
They could be fairly simple tasks like restarting them or checking how long
they have been running. Or, you might want to do more complicated things like
installing software and then configuring that software based upon your own specific
criteria. You also might want to add users and configure permissions for them.
</p><p>
What if you have ten or maybe even 100 servers though? Imagine logging
in one at a time to each server individually, issuing the same commands on those
100 machines and then editing the configuration files on all
100 machines? What a pain! Just updating user password policies would
take days, and introducing an error would be quite likely. What if
you could update all your servers at once just by typing one single command?
The solution? Salt Stack!
</p><p>
Like my daughter, you may not have heard of Salt Stack (<a href="http://saltstack.org" target="_self">saltstack.org</a>),
but you might be familiar with Puppet (<a href="http://puppetlabs.com" target="_self">puppetlabs.com</a>) and
Chef (<a href="http://opscode.com" target="_self">opscode.com</a>). Salt is a similar tool, but it's written in
Python, is relatively lightweight as far as resources and
requirements, and it's much easier to use (in my opinion). Salt uses the
0MQ (<a href="http://www.zeromq.org" target="_self">www.zeromq.org</a>) communication layer, which makes it really fast. It
also is entirely open source, licensed under the
Apache2 (<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" target="_self">www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0</a>) license, and boasts a
vibrant and productive community.
</p><p>
There currently aren't any plans to release a crippled community version or a
more feature-rich paid enterprise edition either. With Salt, the version you get
is the version everyone else gets too&mdash;whether you've paid money or not. There
are plans for an enterprise version, but it merely will be less bleeding-edge
and will be subjected to a higher amount of testing and quality assurance, and
it possibly will include training as well. 
</p><p>
Tools like Salt, Puppet and Chef allow you to issue commands on multiple
machines at once, and install and configure software too. 
Salt has two main aspects: configuration management and remote
execution.
</p><p>
Salt Stack is a command-line tool.
There isn't anything to click on with your mouse, and the feedback is presented
as text that is returned on your screen. This is good. It keeps things
lean, and most servers don't include a graphical user interface anyway.
(Note: I use the terms Salt and Salt interchangeably throughout this article.
They mean the same thing in this context.)
</p><p>
In this article, I cover the two tools included with Salt.
The first is remote execution,
although there isn't any clear delineation or any different way to interact with
Salt if you want to work with configuration management or remote execution. This
allows you to log in to a master machine and then execute commands on one or
many other machines at once. With Salt, you simply type your command once on your
master machine, and it executes on every machine, or even a targeted group of
machines. 
</p><p>
Second, Salt is capable of storing configuration directives, and then
instructing other machines to follow those directives by doing things like
installing software, making configuration changes to the software, and then
reporting back on the progress and success or failures of the installation.
</p><p>
Later, I demonstrate using Salt to install an additional package on one, or
even 1,000 machines, and then configure that package by issuing just one
command.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0xdb38d8"></a>
Installing Salt</h2></div></div><p>
Salt is a constantly evolving organism. Possibly by the time you read this, some
things may have changed. 
You always can find the most current documentation here: <a href="http://docs.saltstack.org/en/latest/index.html" target="_self">docs.saltstack.org/en/latest/index.html</a>.
</p><p>
You do need a few prerequisites before installing Salt:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
A Linux server.
</p></li><li><p>
sudo or root access to this server.
</p></li><li><p>
An Internet connection to this server.
</p></li><li><p>
Knowledge of your server's IP address (it can be a public or private
address).
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Even though Salt is designed to interact with multiple servers, for this
tutorial, you actually can accomplish everything on one machine.
</p><p>
Use your package manager to install Salt, and
follow the installation guide found in the Salt
Docs for your particular distribution (<a href="http://docs.saltstack.org/en/latest/topics/installation/index.html" target="_self">docs.saltstack.org/en/latest/topics/installation/index.html</a>).
You'll also need sudo or root privileges to use
Salt and install these packages.
</p><p>
The benefits of using a package manager or installing from source are a
constant source of on-line and water-cooler debates. Depending on your
distribution, you may have to install the packages from source instead of using
your package manager. 
</p><p>
If you'd like to install from source, you can find the latest Salt source
files in the Salt Project's GitHub
repository (<a href="https://github.com/saltstack/salt" target="_self">https://github.com/saltstack/salt</a>).
</p><p>
After following the instructions for installing both a salt-master and
salt-minion, hopefully, everything went well and you didn't receive any errors.
If things didn't work out quite right, support is generally available quickly
from the Salt Stack mailing list
(<a href="http://saltstack.org/learn/#tab-mailinglist" target="_self">saltstack.org/learn/#tab-mailinglist</a>)
and the #salt IRC channel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0xdb4068"></a>
Configure Your Master and Minion(s)</h2></div></div><p>
The terms master and minion refer to the controller and the controlled. The
master essentially is the central coordinator for all of the minions&mdash;similar to
a client/server configuration where the master is the server, and the minion is
the client.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0xdb4170"></a>
Minion Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
For this tutorial, I cover issuing salt-master and salt-minion commands on the
same machine. If you are configuring multiple machines, choose one to be the
master, and all the others will be minions. The choice of master or minion is
yours, and there are many reasons to configure one machine as the master. I
explain how to
set one as a master and the other(s) as minions next.
</p><p>
Salt's configuration files are located in /etc/salt.
By default, these
files are named minion and master. If you've installed the salt-master and
salt-minion on the same machine, you will see two respective files, master and
minion.
</p><p>
You first need to tell your minion how to locate and communicate with your
master. Even though you are running both on the same server, you still need to
tell your minion where your master is.
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Using your favorite text editor, open the minion file.
</p></li><li><p>
Uncomment the line <tt  ># master: salt</tt> by removing the
<tt  >#</tt> and replacing <tt  >salt</tt> with
the your master's IP address. It now should look like this: <tt  >master:
your.ip.address.here</tt>. (If you're doing this locally on the same machine, you
can add 127.0.0.1.)
</p></li><li><p>
Give your minion a nickname. Locate the line <tt  >#id:</tt>, and again remove
the <tt  >#</tt> and add a name <tt  >id:
1st-Salt-Minion</tt>. (This name can be anything
you want.)
</p></li><li><p>
Restart your minion using <tt  >sudo salt-minion -d</tt> in order
for it to read the new
configuration settings. The <tt  >-d</tt> flag d&aelig;monizes the process and starts
the minion in the background, so you still can access your
command-line to issue more commands.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0xdb4958"></a>
Accept Your Minion's Keys</h2></div></div><p>
Now that your minion knows where your master is, it's time for them to authenticate
one another.
Salt uses public key
encryption
to secure the
communication between master and minions. You need to notify the master
and minion that they can trust each other by accepting the minion's keys on the
master.
</p><p>
Accept your minion's keys using the <tt  >salt-key</tt> command. Salt automatically
takes care of generating these keys for you, so you simply need to accept the
minion(s) you want.
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Type <tt  >salt-key -L</tt> to get a list of all pending, accepted and rejected keys.
</p></li><li><p>
You should see an unaccepted key for <tt  >1st-Salt-Minion</tt> (or whatever ID you
chose for your minion).
</p></li><li><p>
Accept this key using <tt  >sudo salt-key -a 1st-Salt-Minion</tt>.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0x11ad128"></a>
Test Communications</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have a salt-master and a salt-minion, and the minion and master
trust one another, you can check the connection by issuing a test ping command
from the master. This will return &ldquo;True&rdquo; if your master can communicate with your
minion.
Type <tt  >salt '*' test.ping</tt>, and it should return:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;{1st-Salt-Minion: True}
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that the wild-card <tt  >'*'</tt> targets every minion, and as
you have only one,
this is basically moot (it's just faster than typing
<tt  >salt
'1st-Salt-Minion' test.ping</tt>).
</p><p>
If you receive a &ldquo;True&rdquo; response back from your minion, you have 
installed Salt Stack successfully and configured your master and minion to
communicate properly. 
</p><p>
If you don't, you may want to restart your master and minion without the
<tt  >-d</tt>
(d&aelig;mon) flag, so you can observe the output. For more information, see the
Salt documentation at <a href="http://docs.saltstack.org/en/latest/topics/configuration.html" target="_self">docs.saltstack.org/en/latest/topics/configuration.html</a>.
</p><p>
The Salt command syntax involves the command, the target(s) and the action. So,
for this example, <tt  >'*'</tt> targets everything (it's a wild
card), and <tt  >test.ping</tt> is the
action. 
</p><p>
You can now execute any available command on any connected and authenticated
minion. Important note: these commands must be available on the targeted minion in
order to execute them.
For instance, a command like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo salt '*' cmd.run "service apache2 restart"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0x11ad7b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
would work only for a distribution that calls the Apache Web server apache2 and
that has the Apache Web server installed. For others, you would need to issue the
command: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo salt '*' cmd.run "service httpd restart"
</pre>
</p><p>
Some other examples might include querying the amount of time your servers have been
running. You can do that with: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo salt '*' cmd.run "uptime"
</pre>
</p><p>
If you had, for example, Apache Bench installed on a master but not on a minion,
the command: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo salt '*' cmd.run "ab -n 10 -c 2
 &#8618;http://www.google.com:80/index.html"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0x11ada70"></a></h2></div></div><p>
would fail if you tried to execute it on a minion, since Apache Bench isn't
installed on the minion.
</p><p>
The possibilities here are practically limitless. You can reboot all of your
machines at once, update system software and check your machines' health from one
terminal instead of logging in to each machine and issuing these commands
independently.
</p><p>
You also can target specific groups, based upon criteria that you select. See
the <tt  >-G</tt> flag documentation at <a href="http://saltstack.org" target="_self">saltstack.org</a> for more options.
</p><p>
Very rarely should you ever need to log in to a minion again. All configuration
and execution can be handled remotely, quickly and simultaneously.
</p><p>
Now that you've installed Salt and can execute remote commands, why stop there?
The second part of Salt's power comes from the configuration management tools
included with Salt.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0x11adde0"></a>
Configuration Management</h2></div></div><p>
If you haven't used any type of configuration management system before, here
is a simple example. Say you have a set of configurations and packages that you
generally install for every Web server. You can keep these configuration
directives in small text files and then instruct your servers to install these
packages and configure them to your liking, every time you create a new server.
You also can use configuration management to keep all of your servers updated 
once they have been created and respond to changes in packaging or new
configurations. 
</p><p>
Let's install
the libpam-cracklib package, so you can add
additional requirements for user passwords. I chose this package because
it is useful for almost any server connected to the Internet. It allows you to
set additional password requirements regarding length, and it requires that your
users' passwords contain special characters or numerals. You easily
could substitute any particular package you want. These examples do require that
the
package be available in your system's package manager though.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0x11adf40"></a>
Storage of the Configuration Directives</h2></div></div><p>
Salt's configuration management directives and files are, by default, kept within
the /srv/salt directory. This is where all your configuration files and any
files you want to copy to any of your minions reside. Salt also includes a
file server system as part of the configuration management features. Salt doesn't
touch your master's system files though, so don't worry; all configuration
management takes place within the /srv/salt directory.
</p><p>
Salt, by default, uses PyYAML (<a href="http://pyyaml.org" target="_self">pyyaml.org</a>) syntax for its template files,
but numerous other templating languages are available as well. Be sure to follow the proper
formatting techniques for YAML, which involves two spaces instead of tabs.
I have found the on-line YAML parser (<a href="http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com" target="_self">yaml-online-parser.appspot.com</a>) to be 
invaluable when troubleshooting syntax issues with YAML files.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0x11ae150"></a>
Enable Configuration Management</h2></div></div><p>
To enable the configuration management functionality within Salt, you need to
edit your master configuration file once again.
In /etc/salt, open your master file and locate the lines that refer to
<tt  >file_roots</tt>. In the default configuration, this was around line 156. Now,
uncomment this directive by removing the <tt  >#</tt> from the following lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
file_roots:
  base:
    - /srv/salt
</pre>
</p><p>
This tells Salt where to locate your configuration management files. Depending on
how you installed Salt, you may need to create the /srv/salt directory.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0x11ae3b8"></a>
Create a Top File or &ldquo;Roadmap&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>
The base configuration file is known as a Top File, and it resides within the
/srv/salt directory. Let's create one now. This file provides mappings for other
files and can be used to set a base configuration for all servers. Again, with your
favorite text editor, create a top.sls file within the /srv/salt directory. You
can think of this file as a roadmap for different directions for each minion.
Within your top.sls file, add the following lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
base:
  '*'
    - servers
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >base</tt> directive lets Salt know that this configuration is a base configuration
and can be applied to all machines. The wild-card <tt  >'*'</tt>
targets every machine. The <tt  >-
servers</tt> directive is an arbitrary name that allows you to recognize what the
directive pertains to. Feel free to choose something that makes sense to you.
This entry also refers to a particular configuration file that you will now create
to install the libpam-cracklib.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0x11ae6d0"></a>
Create a Server-Specific Configuration File</h2></div></div><p>
After you save your top.sls file, create a new file called servers.sls within the
/srv/salt directory. This file will hold your specific configuration, including
the name of the package to be installed and also a reference to a configuration
file.
In the new servers.sls file, add the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
libpam-cracklib:
  pkg:
    - installed
</pre>
</p><p>
The first line is the name of the package specifically how your package manager refers
to it. For example, the Apache HTTP server is called apache2 in aptitude-based
package manager distributions, but httpd in yum-based package management systems.
Make sure you use the proper name for the package depending on
which package manager you are using. You can target specific package names using
what Salt refers to as grains. Refer to the documentation for more
information and advanced examples of using grains in
SLS
files to target distribution-specific systems (<a href="http://salt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/tutorials/states_pt3.html#using-grains-in-sls-modules" target="_self">salt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/tutorials/states_pt3.html#using-grains-in-sls-modules</a>).
</p><p>
Lines 2 and 3 tell Salt what to do with this package. For this example, you want it
installed. To remove a package, you simply would change <tt  >-
installed</tt> to <tt  >- removed</tt>.
Remember, spacing is very important! On line two, there are two spaces before
<tt  >pkg:</tt>, and on the third line, there are four spaces before
<tt  >- installed</tt>. If you
receive any errors, check your syntax via an on-line YAML parser.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0x11aea98"></a>
Copy Configuration Files for Specific Packages</h2></div></div><p>
In order to install the libpam-cracklib package, you need only the first
three lines of this file. You could stop here, and libpam-cracklib would be
installed with the default configuration supplied by your package manager. You
then would need to log in to the machine on which it is installed and configure it for
your particular needs. This defeats the purpose of using configuration
management, and Salt offers a solution to this as well.
</p><p>
Salt can act as a secure file server and copy
files to remote minions.
In this same servers.sls file, add the following lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/pam.d/common-password:
  file:
    - managed
    - source: salt://servers/common-password
    - require:
      - pkg: libpam-cracklib
</pre>
</p><p>
Take note of line 4; this is where you tell Salt your particular file's
location, and the lines after that tell Salt what package is required for this
file.
The line <tt  >- source: salt://</tt> maps to your /srv/salt directory on your master.
</p><p>
After you've saved your servers.sls file, make a new directory under /srv/salt
called servers.
This is where you will store your configuration file for the libpam-cracklib.
</p><p>
When you are installing packages and configuration files, you may want to install
them first on a test server, and then configure them to your liking. Then you can
copy the configuration files into your /srv/salt location. This way, you can
verify that the configuration is functioning properly before deploying it to
multiple servers.
</p><p>
Now your configuration will be available to Salt, and you can place this
configuration on every minion, along with installing the libpam-cracklib package.
Your /srv/salt directory should look something like this now:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/srv/salt
            top.sls
            servers.sls
          /servers
                  common-password
</pre>
</p><p>
I'm using the libpam-cracklib here as an example, but this technique will work
for any software that has configuration files associated with it. For instance,
you 
easily could modify your Apache httpd.conf file to include your server's
hostname and configure virtual hosts. 
</p><p>
With all of your sls files in place and configuration files ready to go, the
last step is to tell Salt to configure your machine remotely.
The <tt  >state.highstate</tt> command is what triggers this synchronization. Using the
previous syntax to target all machines, enter this from the command line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo salt '*' state.highstate
</pre>
</p><p>
Hopefully, after a brief amount of time, your minion will return a success that
looks something like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;
  State: - pkg
  Name:      libpam-cracklib

</p><p>
As you can see, Salt installed the libpam-cracklib package and then copied the
common-password file from the master to the minion in the /etc/libpam-cracklib
directory. 
</p><p>
This was a fairly simple example on just one minion, but if you've ever had to
install a LAMP-based Web server, imagine the amount of time you can
save simply by using Salt's configuration management. Storing these settings in
text files allows you to duplicate and create identical servers quickly.

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
You now have the ability to execute remote commands on multiple machines at once
and store your configurations in easily maintained text files. You can install
software packages specific to a type of server too.
</p><p>
With a little effort in the beginning, you can create one or many servers with
your own specific configurations in the amount of time it takes for the packages
to download to each machine. Salt doesn't execute these sequentially either. The
commands are mostly implemented simultaneously on each machine, and if one minion
happens to fail, the others will continue their progress.
</p><p>
Installing Salt can pay off big dividends later by allowing you to create
specific-use servers based on a tested and repeatable configuration.

Visit the Salt Project page for more detail, and be
sure to check the links for the mailing list, user-contributed documentation and
examples. You'll find the community very welcoming and eager to lend
assistance with any issues you encounter.
