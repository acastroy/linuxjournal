It's not easy being stuck with Windows, but here are a few tips and tricks to
make life a little more familiar.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1350580.0x1448358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The universe seems to have a big, cosmic-size sense of humor. I
recently switched from a job position that allowed me to use Linux
as my day-to-day operating system to a position that forces me to use
Windows. Mind you, I've had to use different operating systems in the
past, and even managed an entire fleet of OS X workstations, but I've
never been stuck using Windows as my day-to-day computer before. If
you worry that your faithful editor will turn to the dark side and
start touting the benefits of a Microsoft operating system&mdash;yeah,
not so much. Although I'll admit my computer has locked up only once in
the past month (which would mean a serious hardware problem in Linux,
but I digress), even a stable Windows system isn't Linux. So in this article,
I try to make life a little bit easier for fellow Linux users who can
see the light, but are stuck behind the Windows.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1350580.0x1448510"></a>
The Simplest Answer: Virtualization</h2></div></div><p>
My first day on the job, after I learned to press Ctrl-Alt-Delete to log
in (am I the only one who finds that weird?), I downloaded virtualization
software. On Windows, there are quite a few options from which to choose, but
it turns out that many of them are expensive. Thankfully, VirtualBox is free,
and it runs quite nicely under Windows (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11386f1.large.jpg"><img src="11386f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. VirtualBox is really quite nice, and it supports Linux fairly well.
</p></div></div><p>
I've found my favorite way to use Linux in a virtual machine is to put
it full screen on a secondary monitor. If you can use a second monitor
at work, it is reminiscent of using Synergy to share the same mouse and
keyboard on two computers. It's important to note that although VM technology
has come a long way, the performance is not quite the same as a real
machine, especially when it comes to video acceleration. For general
office work, however, I've found the VM to be quite responsive and usable.
</p><p>
If you don't have a second monitor or can't dedicate a full screen to
Linux, VirtualBox (and most other virtualization packages) offers a
&ldquo;seamless&rdquo; mode. This is a nifty mode that puts the menu bar on your
screen, but it allows for application windows to work alongside Windows
applications. The downside of this, however, is that because they appear
as native apps, it would seem that you could drag applications from screen
to screen. This is not the case, however, so know your Linux apps will
be stuck to a single screen. (This obviously is a moot point if you 
have only one screen!)
</p><p>
Because VirtualBox allows you to set up a virtual NAT network, installing
one or more instances of Linux won't necessarily show up on the
corporate network. Ideally, your Linux installs will be isolated behind
your Windows box, and no one will be the wiser. It's important to see
how your network settings are configured, however, because you might
not be able to connect at all if your network is set to bridged mode.

Yes, Cygwin...</h2></div></div><p>
Anytime someone talks about Linux users forced to use Windows, the
discussion invariably turns to Cygwin&mdash;and rightly so. Cygwin is an
interesting program that brings a Linux look and feel to Windows. The
Cygwin setup utility will install a wide variety of familiar applications
that are compiled to run natively under Windows (Figures 2 and 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11386f2.large.jpg"><img src="11386f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Cygwin does have a nice installation system.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11386f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Trusty old vim is running in Windows.
</p></div></div><p>
Cygwin not only provides Windows-native versions of many Linux
applications, it also includes a full X server. This X server runs
alongside Windows, and it can run X applications installed locally or
tunneled over SSH from a remote server. If it sounds like Cygwin is too
good to be true, you're sorta right. Although it includes some amazing
features and has a very familiar interface, to me it feels clunky
to use. Before I get hate mail, let me be clear. Cygwin is amazing;
it's just that I don't like the feel of the interface. It reminds me of
using Linux back in the days when TWM was a viable window manager. I
recommend giving Cygwin a try to see if it fills your needs. It is
completely free, so there's no reason not to install it.

What I Actually Use: Putty</h2></div></div><p>
If you're like me, chances are you have a Linux machine running at
home. It's also very likely you have broadband Internet and a dedicated
&ldquo;always on&rdquo; connection. With a little bit of port forwarding on your
router, accessing your computer at home is usually pretty painless. It
turns out that a simple terminal window connected to a familiar Linux computer
is all I need. When I add Xming (which unfortunately requires a donation
to get the latest version), everything I need from home is available on
my Windows machine. Here's my basic setup:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Putty:</b></span>
if you like the command line and are comfortable with tools like Irssi
and BitlBee (Figure 4), Putty is an open-source SSH client for
Windows that supports many features Linux users expect. That
said, the configuration for Putty can be confusing. Basically, you need
to set up all the options you want for a particular profile, then save
the profile. The next time you load that profile, all the settings will
return. I've had issues with trying to change settings on an existing
profile, but I eventually managed to figure it out. Figures 5 and
6 show a couple important settings in Putty. It's possible to tunnel
X traffic to your local Windows machine, and it's also easy to set up
port tunneling for multiple ports.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Xming:</b></span>
this option, like many things in Windows, isn't really free. It's
sort of free, in that you don't actually pay for a license, but if you
want to get the program for Windows, you need to donate to the Xming
Project. Basically, Xming is an X11 server that happily sits in the
system tray and waits for an X program to access it. If you have X
forwarding turned on with Putty (or use the -X flag while SSHing from
Cygwin), starting an X Window System application is as easy as typing its name.
Figure 7 shows a Putty window in which I've typed
<tt  >gnome-terminal</tt>.
You can see GNOME Terminal started and appeared on the screen like a
regular Windows application. I also put a tiny instance of Notepad in
the screenshot to show that it really is Windows! Although the pay wall
for Xming is frustrating, I find it's unobtrusive nature to be worth it.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Screen:</b></span>
although starting X applications is seamless, it's not something I do
very often. Most of the time I just use the command line and the screen
command. To be fair, &ldquo;screen&rdquo; has nothing to do with Windows, but it
makes working from a Windows environment much easier. I simply run Irssi
in a screen session, and IRC/IM is available anywhere, anytime
(Figure 4). Kyle Rankin has done some great articles on screen in the
past, so I won't elaborate much here. Simply put, screen allows applications
to stay running even after you disconnect your SSH session. For IRC,
this means never logging out, which is very convenient.

Going Native</h2></div></div><p>
If you aren't thrilled with the idea of using SSH or setting up an
X server on Windows, it's certainly possible to stick with Windows
applications. Granted, that won't be the same as using Linux, but 
many open-source applications are available for Windows users. The most
commonly used are Firefox and LibreOffice, but if you're committed to
using as much open source as possible, there are many, many options. In
fact, each month I highlight an open-source application available for
non-Linux platforms in our UpFront section.
</p><p>
Along with running open-source programs specifically compiled for
Windows, don't forget the Web-only applications available, regardless of
your underlying operating system. Whether you want to use TweetDeck for
sending Tweets or want a simple word processor like WriteBox (which
I'm using right now), Web apps are getting more and more powerful every
day. I find myself using Pixlr more often than The GIMP or Photoshop,
regardless of what platform I'm using.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1350580.0x1449c70"></a>
Flip the Problem on Its Head!</h2></div></div><p>
Do you have control over the computer you're using at work? Maybe
suffering through Windows isn't something you need to do at all. If
there's anything Linux users are used to, it's surviving in a Windows
world. Perhaps you actually could run Linux on your computer, and no
one ever has to know!
</p><p>
If you have to run only an application or two under Windows, it's possible
Wine will work instead of booting into Windows. Sometimes the only reason
we need to use Windows is because certain Web sites will function
only under Internet Explorer. Using Wine, or CrossOver Office, running IE
under Linux can be very possible.
</p><p>
If Wine won't run the applications you need, or if you need the Windows
operating system for other specific purposes, what about running Windows
inside a virtual environment? Oddly enough, Windows support as a guest
operating system is usually better than Linux support, so even things
like video acceleration might work. If you can do most of your work in
Linux, but need that Windows environment every once in a while, a VM
might be the perfect solution.
</p><p>
And, of course, if nothing else, Linux will dual-boot quite nicely
with Windows. Even if you're stuck using Windows for every aspect of
your job, perhaps you can reboot into Linux when you want a familiar
environment. (This is especially useful if you have a company laptop
you are allowed to take home.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1350580.0x1842128"></a>
Home Is So Much Sweeter</h2></div></div><p>
For many readers, installing programs, partitioning hard drives and
running virtual environments is just not allowed. All I can offer you
is the comfort that at home, you can run whatever you like. If you're
stuck running Windows and can't even run the programs I talked
about today, at least you can browse <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> on your Windows
machine. The Web version even works with Internet Explorer!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1350580.0x1842288"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Beware the License Beast</b></p><p>
Something I've noticed about using Windows is that many software packages
are &ldquo;free&rdquo;, but only for personal use. If you are stuck using Windows at
work, be sure to read the fine print. The VirtualBox add-on from Oracle
is a perfect example. In order to get USB2 and PXE support, you need
to install the add-on, but if you're not using it for personal use,
it's not free.
