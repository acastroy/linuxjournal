Mobile phone companies are good at it. Maybe too good.

I'm writing this in an Amsterdam apartment we rented for the weekend
through AirBNB. The main reason we chose this place wasn't comfort or
convenience. It was connectivity. This apartment was relatively cheap
(about a quarter or a third of the price of a three-star hotel), but reports said
the Internet connection was good.
</p><p>
And so it is. Speedtest.net tells me I'm getting 40Mb/s downstream and
2.5Mb/s up. That's a bit lopsided for my tastes (I upload a lot of stuff
and back up in the cloud), but it's a heck of a lot better than what most
of the hotels provide, which on the whole is awful. (At least in the US
and in Europe, which is where I do nearly all my traveling.)
</p><p>
But when we leave the apartment here, we become data-poor. And that's by
intent of the mobile phone companies that provide the only easily available
source of Internet connectivity.
</p><p>
Open Wi-Fi access points, once plentiful, are now rare as four-leaf clovers
and far more lucky to find. (Our many reports in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> on open
Wi-Fi, published from 2002&ndash;2004, look like paradise compared with today.)
That puts you at the mercy of cell-phone companies. Most (or all) of those
in other countries would rather not sell data usage to short-term visitors,
so your only choice is using your domestic phone.
</p><p>
Ours are AT&amp;T phones. So let's look at what AT&amp;T charges, both within the
US and outside the country. Note that I'm doing this as a customer trying
to figure things out, not as a math whiz looking for problem challenge. But
that's what we have here, and if I fail, please correct me. However, bear in
mind that the failing is not mine alone, but a feature of AT&amp;T marketing.
</p><p>
For US customers, AT&amp;T has three plans
(<a href="http://www.att.com/shop/wireless/data-plans.html#fbid=6jmPMqgegnI" target="_self">www.att.com/shop/wireless/data-plans.html#fbid=6jmPMqgegnI</a>):
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
$20/month for 300MB ($.067 per MB, $.0067 per KB), then $20 for each
additional 300MB.
</p></li><li><p>
$30/month for 3GB ($.01 per MB, $.001 per KB), then $10 for each additional 1GB.
</p></li><li><p>
$50/month for 5GB ($.01 per MB), then $10 for each additional 1GB.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
So here's what you need to figure out before you choose one:
</p><p>
1) For both the $30 and the $50 plan, the rate is $10 per GB, which is $1 per
100MB and $.01 per KB.
</p><p>
2) The per-MB (or KB) rate in the $20 plan is 6.7x the rate for the other two
plans, and &ldquo;saves&rdquo; money only if you stay under 300MB for the month, which
isn't much data if you're an active user. As soon as you go over, you get
charged for another 300MB, or $40 total for the month&mdash;meaning you're
better off with the $30 plan. That is, if you know for sure that you'll use
more than 300MB.
</p><p>
3) If you pay $30 for 3GB and use 5GB, or 6GB, or 7GB or 10GB, you pay no more
than the person who uses the same quantity and pays $50 for 5GB. Yet the
5GB customer using only 3GB still pays for 5GB. So there's no reason at all
to go for the $50 plan, even if you use 10GB/month. You're still paying $10
per GB.
</p><p>
4) You still feel screwed if you pay $30 and use only 1GB, because you're
still paying for 3GB.
</p><p>
But all of that is dirt cheap compared to AT&amp;T's international data rates
(<a href="http://www.wireless.att.com/learn/international/roaming/affordable-world-packages.jsp#data" target="_self">www.wireless.att.com/learn/international/roaming/affordable-world-packages.jsp#data</a>). Let's unpack those:
</p><p>
1) &ldquo;Pay-per-use&rdquo; is $0.015 per KB in Canada and $0.0195 per KB
in &ldquo;Rest of
World&rdquo; (aka RoW).
</p><p>
2) Since there's 1,000 KB in a MB, that's $15 for 1MB of data in Canada and
$19.50 for 1MB everywhere else (actually, 140 countries). If you use 1GB,
which is 1,000MB, that's $1,500 in Canada and $1,950 in RoW.
</p><p>
3) The above, therefore, shakes you down in to a plan. There are three to choose
from:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
$30 for 100MB.
</p></li><li><p>
$60 for 300MB.
</p></li><li><p>
$120 for 800MB.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Translated to GB, that's $300 for 1GB at the 100MB and 300MB quantities,
and a bit less at the 800MB level&mdash;and that's all for less than 1GB of
usage. Even if you pay the top price of $300 for 800MB, you're paying $3,900
for the next 200MB, because you're in pay-per-use-ville above the 800MB
level.
</p><p>
In other words, you pay $4,200 if you use 1GB while paying $300 for AT&amp;T's
top International data plan. (And never mind that AT&amp;T doesn't tell you
that's for both upstream and down, added together. I found that out when I
called the company on the phone once to talk about it.)
</p><p>
So my wife and I each went with the $30 plan.
</p><p>
Now, since all this data is metered, how can we monitor it on our end?
</p><p>
With iPhones (which we're using here), we need to go into
Settings&rarr;General&rarr;Usage&rarr;Cellular Usage after landing outside
the US and then
press Reset Statistics, erasing whatever record we had of use since the last
reset. (The only memory we have of the statistics is a screenshot. This
sets Cellular Network Data use at zero&mdash;presumably.)
</p><p>
When I did that, while on Wi-Fi here at the apartment, the meter
immediately read 13KB sent and 56KB received. For what I had no idea, but
already I felt screwed, because I wasn't on the mobile data network.
(VodafoneNL, the phone tells me.)
</p><p>
When we walk around Amsterdam, we have to keep our Cellular Data and/or
Data Roaming off, until we want to look at a map or pick up e-mail or some
other thing that doesn't invite down a huge blast of data. And then, to
monitor use, we have to drill back down that same directory path to see
where we stand. My wife has done most of the roaming. In two days, she has
received 9.5MB and sent 688KB. Is that for real? How can we tell? And why
should we care?
</p><p>
I'll grant that the cost of connecting people is more than zero. But is the
cost they're passing through that of data? Or are they just charging for
sums of data because they have to charge for something, so why not?
</p><p>
I don't know, and I would welcome some answers, if readers have any. I know a
lot of people in and around these businesses and still have not heard
satisfying answers.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, it seems to me that there are matters of economic externality to
consider. High data use costs and fear of bill shock cause negative
externalities through lost business and diminished economic activity. Also,
given that the Internet's cost-free base protocols comprise one huge
positive externality generator, it should seem wise of mobile phone
companies to participate in that economy, rather than restrict the whole
thing to what little they can extract from customers they clearly enjoy
frustrating.
</p><p>
A few minutes ago, a friend close to the business told me the problem is
that the big mobile phone companies, at least in the US (that would be
AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon) actually hate their customers. In fact,
we take this for granted. In a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></span> essay of mine last
summer
(<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444873204577535352521092154.html" target="_self">online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444873204577535352521092154.html</a>),
the pull-quote they put in bold face was &ldquo;Choosing among AT&amp;T,
Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon for your new smartphone is like choosing where
you'd like to live under house arrest.&rdquo; It was the line quoted most by
others as well. But my friend took the hate thing a step further. He said
treating customers like prisoners eliminates the main sensory path between
a company and the marketplace, thus blinding the company not only to
externalities of many kinds, but to opportunities as well.
</p><p>
So I take heart in another piece of news I picked up today: Mozilla's Boot
to Gecko, or B2G (<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G" target="_self">https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G</a>), now re-dubbed Firefox OS
(<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS" target="_self">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS</a>),
&ldquo;uses a Linux kernel and boots
into a Gecko-based runtime engine, which lets users run applications
developed entirely using HTML, JavaScript, and other open Web application
APIs&rdquo;.
</p><p>
In other words, it's smaller, lighter, simpler and less complicated to
deploy than Android. Here are the components listed on the Firefox OS page:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Gaia, the user interface, is &ldquo;a Web application running atop the Firefox OS
software stack&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
Gonk, the OS layer under Gaia, &ldquo;consists of a Linux kernel and a hardware
abstraction layer to which Gecko communicates&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
Gecko &ldquo;is the layer of Firefox OS that provides the same open Web standards
implementation used by Firefox and Thunderbird, as well as many other
applications&rdquo;.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
On the Booting to the Web page
(<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Booting_to_the_Web" target="_self">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Booting_to_the_Web</a>) in the Mozilla Wiki, it says this:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Mozilla believes that the Web can displace proprietary, single-vendor
stacks for application development. To make open Web technologies a better
basis for future applications on mobile and desktop alike, we need to keep
pushing the envelope of the Web to include&mdash;and in places
exceed&mdash;the
capabilities of the competing stacks in question.
</p><p>
We also need a hill to take, in order to scope and focus our efforts.
Recently we saw the pdf.js project expose small gaps that needed filling in
order for &ldquo;HTML5&rdquo; to be a superset of PDF. We want to take a bigger step
now, and find the gaps that keep Web developers from being able to build
apps that are&mdash;in every way&mdash;the equals of native apps built for the
iPhone, Android and WP7.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
In July, <span   class="emphasis"><em>TechWeek Europe</em></span> reported a Firefox OS prototype being shown off by
Telef&oacute;nica, which is big in Europe and many Latin countries
(<a href="http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/news/telefonica-firefox-os-smartphone-prototype-85340" target="_self">www.techweekeurope.co.uk/news/telefonica-firefox-os-smartphone-prototype-85340</a>). Here's the
closing line from that piece: &ldquo;The first handset based on the platform will
be released in Brazil on Telef&oacute;nica's Vivo brand in Brazil next year and
will cost less than $100.&rdquo; Yay.
</p><p>
They're playing a value creation game, instead of a value subtraction one.
It's a winning strategy in the long run. Let's help Mozilla make that run
as short as possible.
