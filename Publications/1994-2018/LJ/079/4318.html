Tiemann is well known for his extensive and important work on
<span   class="bold"><b>g++</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>gdb</b></span>. A founding member and former
CTO of Cygnus Support, Michael joined Red Hat when they purchased
Cygnus. He now serves as Red Hat's CTO.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Tell us about Red Hat
and Embedded Systems.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: Let me start first
by talking about one of the keynotes I've been giving this year. It
is based on a book called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Guns, Germs, and
Steel</em></span> by Jared Diamond, and I don't know if you've heard
of this book. It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1998. He is a sort of an
anthropologist and linguist and biologist all wrapped into one. He
uses his extensive array of scientific techniques to answer
interesting questions like, &ldquo;Why did people from Spain set sail to
the New World and conquer large civilizations instead of the other
way around?&rdquo;</p><p>With respect to embedded systems the question that I'm
thinking the most about today is, &ldquo;Will open source change
embedded, or the other way around?&rdquo; The reason that this is an
interesting question is because the dynamics that open source
enjoys-readily downloadable software, a large developer community
sharing software which can easily be downloaded, installed and
modified-is quite different than what we think of in the
traditional embedded systems world where things like ROM are where
programs are stored. The interesting question will be, &ldquo;what
extent are the constraints of the embedded systems world going to
change the open-source approach to programming?&rdquo; There's a lot of
interesting stuff going on in that direction. Or, the other way
around: is open source actually going to change the way people
design embedded systems. I could give you a couple of examples of
both.</p><p>One is eCos, the Embedded Configurable Operating System. eCos
was designed to fit the constraints, whatever they were, of
embedded systems quite efficiently. What we provide with eCos is a
configuration technology which enables source-level configuration.
What this means is that instead of developers needing to touch
actual source code to make it conform to their world, they can use
a tool to control over 200 different configuration points. The
consequence is that you can deliver a real-time operating system
whose memory footprint ranges in size depending on the needs and
the assumptions of the application.</p><p>There are some applications which have already implemented
their own cooperative threading model and have already implemented
other resource allocation routines similar to those provided by
today's conventional real-time operating systems. In the case where
the application does all the work and they simply need a hardware
abstraction layer, eCos can deliver that with less than 1,000 bytes
of memory footprint. But if you want to turn on scheduling as a
function of the kernel, or you want to turn on management of
memory, or you want to turn on the existence of a file system, et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera, you can do all of this incrementally
and largely independently, and scale that up to typically 100 or
200 kilobytes at the high end.</p><p>We have customers who have not been able to configure
conventional proprietary real-time OSes smaller than about 55
kilobytes. In eCos in this exact customer situation, where the
customer's design requirements were 24K of memory footprint to fit
in the on-chip ROM, eCos came in at 11K by utilizing its
source-level configurability.</p><p>So, in the case where the requirements of embedded systems
are changing the shape of open source, we have built shape-changing
technology for eCos.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Is that shape-changing
technology actually part of the base open-source release of
eCos?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: Yes it is. We
announced the open-source availability of CDL, the Configuration
Description Language, I think last month.</p><p>Now, putting the shoe on the other foot, and looking at how
open source is changing embedded, I have seen a tremendous shift in
interest from traditional proprietary real-time operating systems,
to using embedded Linux. In fact, I can tell you that up until
September of last year, the customers that I talked to tended to
profile the exact same way that IDC profiled the entire market. In
other words, X percent were interested in proprietary RT/OS &ldquo;A&rdquo;,
and Y percent were interested in proprietary RT/OS &ldquo;B&rdquo;e and my
own statistical sampling of the market when I talked to customers
corresponded very accurately to what IDC was reporting in their
vendor numbers.</p><p>Since the announcement of commercially available embedded
Linux was made by a number of companies in September of last year,
I have spoken with exactly zero people who are designing new
embedded devices using proprietary operating systems.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: That's quite a sea
change.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: That is. That's not
to say that people are not buying these operating systems for
legacy applications. I continue to meet with a lot of people who
complain about how difficult it is to change. But in terms of new
designs, it has been like night and day.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Does that include WinCE
and PalmOS?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: I have not talked
to anybody, ever, who has been interested in WinCE. I don't know
about Palm.</p><p>I would say that if you're simply looking to replace a
proprietary RT/OS with embedded Linux, just to change the RT/OS in
the socket, that's not very interesting. What's really interesting
here is if you recognize not only the development community that
comes with Linux, but also the extensibility and the openness of
the platform. With the ability to create new kinds of computing
devices that very much and very effectively blur the lines between
the traditional desktop model, which is sort of going away, and a
pervasive post-PC model, which is coming to the fore, it looks like
embedded Linux may very well be the ingredient that has been
missing in this new post-PC world.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Some of the developers I
know are feeling that they're on a treadmill, keeping up with the
accelerating change in hardware, and one of their problems is
constantly having to rewrite device drivers to adapt to the new
chip that replaces the one that's no longer available. I understand
that one of the attractions of Linux is that other people are
writing a lot of the device drivers.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: Yes. Other people
are writing the device drivers. But also, it is a common practice
for people who write device drivers for Linux to make those drivers
open source.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Exactly. Is the same
dynamic happening with eCos?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: Certainly. That is
a dynamic which we're increasingly seeing. eCos went through what
many real-time operating systems go through, which is that we
announced it two years ago at Embedded Systems West in San Jose. It
went through a gestation period. Of course there are always the
innovators and early adopters who pick up stuff aggressively, but
by and large people waited to see whether or not eCos would mark
its first, and now its second, anniversary. One thing that we've
noticed is that as we are marking its second anniversary, the
number of designs has increased exponentially. With those designs
comes an increasing number of participants in the development
community. That means new board-support packages, ports to new
architectures, device drivers, et cetera. In other words, it is
really beginning to reach its critical mass.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: So what kind of
quantities of &ldquo;design wins&rdquo; are you looking at these days?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: It's a little
tricky. You could be on the list of people who will get the
pre-briefings about announcements we're going to make at ESC West.
But I can't spill those beans too much.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: I'm just looking for a
ballpark. Ten solid wins, a hundred?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: I think we've got
in the neighborhood of tens of announceable wins.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Could you compare and
contrast the areas of application of embedded Linux with that of
eCos?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: eCos is really for
devices that want to have a very simple footprint, the sort of
classic embedded system design where you have a microcontroller and
a device to be controlled. The benefit that eCos gives you is the
ability to use open-source availability, the ability to squeeze a
particular design into much smaller spaces than would be practical
with Linux.</p><p>One that we did announce previously, for example, is an
operating system for Brother's 2400cen printer family. The jobs of
these printers are to be peripherals that apply ink to paper. It is
not likely that users are going to want to be running high volume
web servers on their printers. It is also not likely that people
are going to want to use their printers as additional computing
devices for other purposes. Of course, I'm sure the SETI@Home guys
would love to double their listening capability by running on
unused cycles of color and black-and-white printers. But seriously,
eCos is much more designed for purpose-specific devices.</p><p>Linux is appearing to be a real runaway success story in the
space of Internet appliances, both in the server and client space.
Last month we announced a design success with Ericsson, who has
actually demonstrated a screen-phone platform running on top of Red
Hat Embedded Linux. Our hope is that we will have at least a
picture, if not a model, of this phone on display at the
conference. This is Ericsson's bid for a new, richer, completely
connected device on the client side. There's also a lot of activity
on the server side.</p><p>There are server appliances, residential gateway servers,
small office/home office servers, where you don't want to be
running a full desktop distribution of Linux, and you don't
necessarily want to be running it as a complete Linux server, but
there are capabilities you want, like web serving or firewall or
e-mail or file serving et cetera. The reason you want to have these
devices configured more narrowly is because it dramatically reduces
the complexity of administration.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Bring it home and plug
it in.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: If you want to do
something different, you can just download a different profile and
it will have those properties. When you have a normal Linux server
doing lots of different jobs, it increases your need to have people
who understand network security, and it also means you have to make
more complex resource allocation and monitoring decisions.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: With freedom comes
responsibility.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: Exactly.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: You mentioned Red Hat
Embedded Linux. Is that a distinct distribution at this
point?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: It's a toolkit. It
uses our graphical user-interface technology, called Source
Navigator, as a front end, and what we have right now is a standard
Red Hat distribution configured by this graphical user interface.
So it's not source-level configurability, like we have with eCos,
and in fact it is an open question whether the embedded systems
market will change Linux to be more supportive of source-level
configuration. The current thinking is &ldquo;no&rdquo;, but thinking about
the future is uncertain. If we don't have source-level
configurability, then we still have module-level configurability,
and that's what the graphical user interface from Red Hat
offers.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Is that a distinct Red
Hat product?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: Yes. We call it the
Embedded DevKit. You can actually get it off our web site for $199
(US).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: What's happening with
your embedded API proposal, EL/IX?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: Everywhere I talk
about EL/IX, I talk about POSIX 1003.13. I gave a couple of talks
about embedded Linux at LinuxWorld, and I talked about the fact
that we announced EL/IX two weeks before the POSIX committee went
public with their 1003.13 recommendations. We had known that they
were brewing this, but we also had no certainty as to what the
timeline would be. Because we knew what they were doing, and
because we liked their approach, we took what we figured to be
their ideas. We said, okay, there are going to be four profiles,
and they are going to have these bundles of functionality.</p><p>Then what happened is 1003.13 came out, and PE51, PE52, PE53,
and PE54 corresponded to the four levels that we had picked. Had
POSIX come out with thirteen profiles, or twelve, or seven, or two,
then our work wouldn't have looked at all like theirs. But the fact
that they chose four profiles, as did we, and that those four
profiles do have a pretty straightforward alignment, means we're
getting behind POSIX 1003.12 as a recognized international
standard, and we're lobbying to incorporate more of what we
consider to be the true embedded developer's viewpoint. For
example, POSIX is very proud of their signal model. But, not a lot
of embedded developers that I have talked to like that signal model
very much. POSIX signals are not an option in these profiles.
However, they are an option, in or out, in ours. The way to look at
EL/IX is four profiles: from minimal controller to minimal real
time to single process to full-blown multiprocess system.</p><p>Number one, we think the theory is correct, but we want to
offer people additional configuration options. Whether or not you
have signals, whether or not you have networking support, whether
or not you have file system support, is (or can be) orthogonal to
the four levels.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: So your energy at this
point is going behind the POSIX effort, and bringing that forward
and making it useful to embedded developers?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: Yes.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Then the process of
EL/IX implementation, either as a layer on top of eCos or as
additional elements in the Linux kernel, needs to wait until some
finalization on the POSIX 1003.13?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: No. The thing that
needs to wait is whether or not Linux is going to support the
concept of source-level configurability. As far as what's in POSIX
1003.13, and as far as what options and configuration bundles we
want to offer, we believe that our approach is consistent with what
POSIX is doing. We anticipate that we will offer something which
will be POSIX-conforming. It will also have other options. The fact
that you can always get to POSIX from Linux is going to be
something which will make people very comfortable.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: So you're moving your
efforts forward anticipating converging with POSIX as it moves
along?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: Yes. I think that
last year Linus Torvalds said he's happy to see POSIX become more
Linux-compliant.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Your EL/IX process is
moving forward at this point?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: Yes.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: The EL/IX draft standard
1.1 on your web site is dated in January. Is there going to be a
new draft?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: I am hoping so.
We've got people under the gun for the Embedded Systems Conference.
I can't make any promises. But we'd certainly like to have
something fresh for the September show.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: How's the Red Hat/Cygnus
integration going along?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: It's going along
very well. The magnitude of the merger was pretty substantial. We
hit the ground running at the beginning of this year, and in
another ten days we'll be announcing earnings. Last quarter when we
did our earnings announcement, there were some very clear ways in
which Cygnus enhanced the Red Hat business with key customer wins,
and since then we've publically announced the relationship with
Motorola for high-availability embedded Linux servers, also with
Ericsson on the screen phone. We've probably got some other
announcements coming out.</p><p>If we were a private company I could tell you a lot more
exciting details.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: You mentioned
Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy in another recent interview. Who's
your favorite character in that book?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: I think it would
have to be Ford Prefect.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Why would that
be?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: Because he is so
oblivious of his own absurdity.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: I guess that would be a
good model for most of us.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: I also enjoy his
optimism.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Thanks so much, Michael,
for taking the time to talk with us.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: Thank you, Dan, and
I hope I see you down at ESC West.</p><p><a href="4318s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
