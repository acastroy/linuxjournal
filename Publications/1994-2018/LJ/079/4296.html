    Tips and suggestions for using Linux on the desktop in a non-Linux
    workplace.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf7e580.0x10764a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>As we've seen over the last 18 months or
so, Linux has stormed up the league tables in terms of server-side
operating systems. Many people, in fact, are now beginning to see
that there are options beyond a small number of large companies
that traditionally held sway over the high-end operating system
market.
</p><p>The next logical step in this evolution of Linux is the
migration from the back-end services, where it has proved itself
admirably, to the desktop. This switch is more difficult to
accomplish, as Linux was traditionally developed with server-side
processing in mind. Until recently, there had been no concerted
effort to develop applications for the end user that could compete
against the dominant players.</p><p>While many argue that Linux is still not ready to act as a
desktop OS, there isn't too far to go before this scenario becomes
feasible. In this article, I aim to give you a feel for some of the
challenges that Linux enthusiasts may meet when setting out to make
this an environment more appealing to their sensibilities, as well
as some tips on resolving them.</p><p>I work as a developer in a small office environment. The
project that I'm working on at the moment has put me in an ideal
situation to experiment with Linux as a serious desktop
environment. I admit that this scenario may not be appropriate for
everyone, but I attempt to deal with handling some of the more
common tasks under Linux.</p><p>The project concerns Java development, with the main
development platform being Solaris. The tasks that I've had to
perform include designing the project, developing and testing code,
tracking project defects, and general day-to-day administration,
such as mail, research, and document reading and writing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf7e580.0x1076710"></a>Design Tools</h2></div></div><p>Most of the design work that takes part in the office
involves the use of UML as the modeling language. In UML there are
a number of conventions for representing different aspects of
object-oriented program design. While there are a plethora of
diagramming tools available for the Windows environment, tools for
the Linux environment are generally lesser known, harder to come
by, and maybe not as polished as their counterparts in the
Microsoft world. Because the development environment that I work in
is predominately Java, I had the advantage of not having to base my
search wholly in the Linux application area; a good tool that is
written in Java is cross platform by nature. While searching for
suitable tools, I came across two likely candidates.</p><p>One of these tools is called ArgoUML. The web site for the
tool, listed in Resources, describes ArgoUML as a cognitive design
tool. It attempts to examine your design and provide suggestions on
what may be lacking, or point out discrepancies in your design. The
version of ArgoUML that was available from the web site was only a
development version. They seem to have moved recently to a new site
and revamped their development efforts.</p><p>On Windows, the Rational Rose UML tool has a pretty powerful
presence in the object-oriented design world. Being able to read
and write project files that are compatible with Rose is a great
advantage. MagicDrawUML is a commercial UML design tool. Written in
Java, it is completely cross-platform, and by exporting your
projects in Rational Rose format, you can also share your work with
others. As a side note, many people claim that Java can be quite
slow, so what the developers did with this tool is pretty
impressive. The user interface is as responsive as any you might
use in a Windows or Linux environment. The downside of this product
is that it doesn't come free. However, the license fees are a
fraction of Rational Rose, and in a commercial development
environment, it may be a worthwhile investment.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf7e580.0x10768c8"></a>Development Tools</h2></div></div><p>In this section, I try to give you some idea of the tools
that are available for Linux that can be used to develop and build
a Java project.</p><p>The build environment we use has been set up with
<span   class="bold"><b>Make</b></span>. This tool is pretty standard
on Linux installations. Make is available on a wide variety of
platforms, so it is a good choice for cross-platform projects. The
bulk of platform independent macros and targets can be defined in
standard Makefiles. By using the following strategy, you can
minimize the fuss that is involved in building over multiple
platforms.</p><p>First, define an environment variable ARCH, which is set to
whatever the <span   class="bold"><b>uname</b></span> command
returns. This can be done at login time by adding the following
command to your .bash_profile (for bash users):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
export ARCH=&lt;\#145&gt;uname'
</pre><p>Then, move all your platform specific Make routines and
definitions to a makefile with a name such as
<b  >Makefile.$ARCH</b>, where <b  >$ARCH</b>
is what is returned by uname on the particular platform. Finally,
in your main makefile, add the following line to include the
platform specific definitions in your make commands:
<pre     class="programlisting">
include Makefile.$(ARCH)
</pre>


This results in the correct makefile definitions being
automatically loaded by make at runtime.
</p><p>The next stage in your build environment is finding a Java
compiler that has been ported to Linux. At the moment, there are a
number of Java compiler and interpreter projects in the pipeline.
But so far, for production work, the options are the Java
development kit that has been ported by the Blackdown team, or the
JDK that is available from IBM. Depending on your situation, there
may be preferences towards either JDK. Both these JDKs support the
latest specifications from Sun.</p><p>Another advantage of using Java is the cross-platform nature
of the byte code that your source code is compiled into. This means
that if you need to use extra class libraries or jar files, there
is no need to go hunting for platform specific implementations.
However, many Java applications do in fact include native
libraries, and this limits execution of these applications to the
platforms that they have been ported to. Depending on how much you
need to run these applications, this may not be a problem. For
example, the project that I'm working on makes use of the Java
Messaging Specification (JMS), defined by Sun. The Java Message
Queue (JMQ) is a product released by Sun that implements JMS. JMQ
hasn't been ported to Linux as of yet, and as a result, I am unable
to test my code against it in Linux. I do need to compile my code
against it, and because the libraries are mostly in jar format, I
can copy the jar libraries onto my local machine and still
successfully build my application against it.</p><p>Applications to help you develop code are two a penny. Each
editor or IDE has their evangelists, so making a recommendation in
this area is always a touchy subject, but I will mention my
favorite editor. Due to job requirements, I was forced to learn
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> a few years ago. Since then, I
have moved onto <span   class="bold"><b>vim</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>gvim</b></span> and never looked back. I've
tried other IDEs now and again, such as JBuilder and even
Microsoft's Developer Studio, but until they implement the vi
keymaps, those IDEs will only ever get a look from me. Where these
IDEs do have advantages over vi is in the debugging aspect, but
sometimes a well-placed println() method will do just as good a
job.</p><p>Vim and gvim have color syntax highlighting, auto-indentation
and other features that are too numerous to list. These editors can
even handle write-build-debug, if set up correctly. An extremely
powerful and easy-to-use function of vi clones is macros. A little
thought about repetitive tasks in an editor can result in a simple
but powerful macro to help you do what might have taken a lot
longer in a less powerful editor.</p><p>What we're left with, then, are two of the more
project-management type features that are usually left until last
in any self-respecting project: source code management and
bug/defect tracking. The most widespread source code management
packages are SCCS, RCS and CVS. SCCS isn't available as an
open-source application, which leaves CVS and RCS. RCS is suitable
for smaller projects. I recently had the opportunity to work with
CVS. While, for the most part, it uses the same format history
files as RCS, the user interface to CVS is much more elegant. Added
to that, you have multiple-developer support and remote-client
support. That last feature comes in quite handy in my setup. Our
CVS repository is stored on a Solaris machine. In my aim to use all
things Linux and to prove that it can actually be done, I installed
a CVS client on my Linux machine (this would probably come standard
on some installations). By setting the CVSROOT environment variable
to access the CVS repository on the Solaris machine remotely, I can
manage my source code locally. CVS uses
<span   class="bold"><b>rlogin</b></span> to execute the CVS commands
remotely, so make sure that you have set up the proper access on
the remote machine. The CVSROOT environment variable needs to
follow the following format in order to have it access a remote
repository:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
export CVSROOT=:ext:hostname:CVSRepository
</pre><p>Good open-source bug/defect tracking software is hard to come
by. I could only find two that looked at all stable. One of these
was dropped because it didn't fully meet our requirements. The only
real possibility available to us was the bug-tracking application
used by the Mozilla team. This application has a decent web-based
user interface, with a MySQL database back-end. It is highly
configurable, and once we got over a few quirks, it was up and
running reasonably quickly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf7e580.0x10770b0"></a>Utilities</h2></div></div><p>Some of the typical Linux utilities come in very handy when
developing a project. Not just for the work involved in coding and
testing, but also the utilities that simply make life a bit easier.
For example, the commands <span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>cat</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>awk</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>egrep</b></span> tend to be used quite a lot
for general system administration, finding your way around your
source files, and writing small scripts that make a job easier.
Without installing something like Cygwin for Windows, you would be
hard-pressed to find similar &ldquo;life-improving&rdquo; utilities on
Microsoft platforms.</p><p>A particular class of utility that is more directly related
to code development would be a &ldquo;pretty printer&rdquo;, or utilities
that can tidy your code for you so that they conform to a
particular standard, such as the Sun Microsystems Java coding
standard, or your own company's coding standard. The indent utility
is available on most Linux systems, and by specifying a range of
options, you can control how the final output is formatted. At the
moment, our project conforms to the Sun Microsystems coding
standard. When I first went looking for the options for indent that
would format Java code to the correct standard, I came across the
<span   class="bold"><b>Jindent</b></span> utility. This is an
indenter written in Java, so again, it is completely
cross-platform. By default, it formats to the Sun standard, and
when creating your own configuration file, you can modify its
output.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf7e580.0x10773c8"></a>System Setup</h2></div></div><p>For backup purposes, we keep most of our development work on
UNIX servers. The majority of our client machines are Windows NT.
The UNIX machines we work with are equipped with NFS and SAMBA. By
sharing out these drives, we can access those resources locally
without having to log into the remote machine. A Linux machine can
mount both NFS and SAMBA drives that have been shared out. By
keeping the same directory structure as that on the remote machine,
you reduce the need to produce machine specific makefiles. For
example, if a required jar library is located under
/opt/FSUNjmq/lib/jms.jar on the remote machine, the makefiles that
you developed can run on both the remote UNIX machine and your
local Linux machine without any modification, by mapping
/opt/FSUNjmq to /opt/FSUNjmq on your local machine. Commands for
sharing out remote drives are similar to the following. For
NFS:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
share /opt/FSUNjmq
</pre><p>For SAMBA, edit the /etc/smb.conf file, copying one of the
example shares, modify it to point to the correct directory, and
make sure to give your user name access permission. It is not
always possible to work solely off your local machine; there will
be times when you will need to log in to the remote machine to run
various processes, such as when there isn't a port available for
the application you wish to test against, or when you need to copy,
move or access large amounts of data. In addition, logging into the
remote machine will give you better network performance. The
<span   class="bold"><b>rlogin</b></span> command gives you easier
access to remote machines than telnet. With rlogin, you can set up
access permissions so that you are not required to enter a user
name and password every time on login. By creating a .rhosts file
in your remote home directory, and by adding your local machine
name, you will be able to drop into the remote machine easily. Just
make sure that your .rhosts is set to read/write permission for the
owner only, and that there is no group or global access allowed.
Otherwise, your automatic authentication will not work.
</p><p>One of the annoying things I found about logging into remote
machines is that you have to set up all your shell preferences a
second time. This can be overcome by configuring a common profile
file and making this available to both your local machine and your
remote machines. Create a .commonProfile file on your remote home
directory, and mount your remote home directory locally. So, in
addition to your /home/username directory, you also have a
/remote/username directory. In your local and remote profiles, you
can then source your .commonProfile. Any changes you need to make
can now be made only once, and they will be reflected in both
environments.</p><p>One important point about remote access to your UNIX servers
is that when setting up a user account for yourself on your local
machine, you should set the same username, uid and gid that you
have been assigned on the remote machine. This makes life much
easier in terms of write, mount and login permissions. Some of the
more experienced users may be familiar with NIS; this is a method
for keeping a central repository of users and passwords across a
number of UNIX machines. With a bit of research, and a suitable
network configuration, it may be possible to set up your Linux
machine to use NIS to allow other users to access your machine.
This avoids the need to duplicate each user id and group id when
you add a new user to your machine.</p><p>An extremely useful ability is being able to run X Window
clients from the remote machine on your local machine. This gives
you access to the remote machine in a graphical environment.
However, even though you can run remote applications in a window on
your local X Window display, in some cases there are
incompatibilities between what the remote application is expecting
from a UNIX X Window system and what your local X Window server
provides. A classic case would be if your X Window server is
running in 16-bit color, but the remote application can only run in
8-bit color. Rather than having to shutdown your X Window session
and restart in 8-bit color, you can either start up a second X
Window session with 8-bit color locally, or you can run the remote
window manager so that it displays on your local machine. The
command for this is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
X :1 -query remotehost
</pre><p>The &ldquo;:1&rdquo; means that you want X to run as your second
display. This requires you to set the display variable on the
remote machine to your second display:
<pre     class="programlisting">
export DISPLAY=yourhost:1
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf7e580.0x10777e8"></a>General Advice</h2></div></div><p>In the way of general advice on how to handle day-to-day
tasks that would normally be done in Windows, I offer the
following:</p><p>Probably the most generic function in any office these days
is reading and writing Microsoft documents, whether Word, Excel or
Powerpoint. StarOffice provides an entire suite of applications
that are capable of reading and writing Microsoft format documents.
With their latest version, they have provided even more support for
Microsoft integration.</p><p>For e-mail, there are loads of mail clients to choose from.
However, this can be restricted depending on the type of mail
server you use. You should have no problem finding mail clients for
POP and IMAP mail. Since I've already mentioned StarOffice, I'd
like to point out that it comes with a built-in mail client for POP
and IMAP mail. Netscape also includes POP and IMAP support.
Difficulties can occur if your company has selected to use
Microsoft Exchange as its e-mail server and hasn't opened up IMAP
or POP access to it. At the moment, there are no IMAP compatible
clients available for Linux. As far as I know, your options here
are limited to e-mail clients that will only run in Windows (if
anyone knows any differently, give me a holler!). See below for
more information on how to combat this.</p><p>Unfortunately, Linux doesn't supply all the capabilities that
are necessary in today's office. We are more often than not
resigned to having to share our machine with Microsoft products.
<span   class="bold"><b>WINE</b></span> provides the ability to run
Microsoft products natively in Linux; however, it leaves a lot to
be desired. For these cases, VMWare is a clever application that
allows you to run an instance of another operating system within
your Linux operating system. Check it out if you haven't come
across it. For me, VMWare provides the ability to run Microsoft
Outlook reading e-mail from our Exchange server. It seems a bit of
an overkill to have another operating system running in order to
just read mail, but we don't always get what we want.</p><p>Printing is an area that can cause a number of headaches when
setting up a Linux operating system; however, printer setup tools
and driver support is improving rapidly. Setting up a network
printer under Linux can be pretty straightforward if you follow the
rules. One thing to watch out for is when you have a printer that
doesn't seem to have its own driver. There are plenty of resources
on the Web detailing how to set up a specific printer even if it
doesn't seem to be supported. For example, we have a Gestetner PCL
printer in the office, but by using the HP LaserJet III printer
driver I now have access to this printer.</p><p>In summary, there are many areas that must be dealt with when
trying to successfully run a Linux operating system in an
environment that doesn't necessarily support it. I've tried to give
you some idea of how I got around the problems I've encountered. In
the Resources section, I've listed some of the web sites that have
come to my aid in researching how to do something in Linux that is
normally done in Windows. But remember, not everything can be done
through Linux, and sometimes you will have to fall back to
non-Linux applications.</p><p><a href="4296s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
