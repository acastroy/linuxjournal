    The author demonstrates how easy it is to write in Python&mdash;and make
    sure you get steamed, not fried rice.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x160b580.0x1703348"></a></h2></div></div><p>Maybe this article should be entitled
&ldquo;How I Discovered Python and Ditched Everything Else&rdquo;, instead. I
have always wanted to write web-based applications but somehow
found that getting started was quite intimidating. So, having
procrastinated for years, I finally got around to writing my first
application. My work required an intra-office application for which
some values needed prompting on a web page. These values are sent
to a CGI script, cross-verified via an SQL database, dispatched to
a waiting process via sockets, and the results sent back to the web
page.
</p><p>By luck, I stumbled upon a scripting language called Python.
I was reading a recent issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>
(December 1999), in which they interviewed Eric Raymond, who
mentioned that he now programs only in Python. At that point, I was
a day into implementing the above system in Perl and was not quite
finished. If Python was good enough for Eric, it was worth a
try.</p><p>Well, I finished what I wanted to do in just over two hours.
This was using a language that I had not heard of two hours
earlier. At the risk of losing my professional advantage, I thought
I would share with others how easy Python is to use, especially to
do CGI (and almost everything else). As the above application would
be too technical and boring to actually work through (and I'd
probably get sued by my employers), I've decided to work through
another, much more interesting exercise.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x160b580.0x1703558"></a>The Problem Description</h2></div></div><p>Work being situated in a semi-remote location (culinary-wise,
except for the place next door, which has excellent food but is a
bit expensive to eat lunch at every day), take-out lunch was
organised to be delivered to us once a week. Each participant took
turns organised the lunch orders. Being spread out over three
floors, it was quite a chore, and no one looked forward to doing
it. A web-based ordering system seemed to me the obvious solution
but not having done any CGI programming before, it seemed quite
overwhelming. The others did not seem to care. But writing CGI web
systems can be quite simple, especially when one can do it using
Python. (Okay, Perl gurus may disagree, but that's the whole point,
i.e., a Perl guru versus a Python novice!)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x160b580.0x1703660"></a>The Initial Requirements</h2></div></div><p>I knew roughly how I wanted it structured. There'd be a web
page with a pull-down list with the restaurant menu, and, by
clicking on a submit button, an e-mail with the
person&lt;/#146&gt;s order would be sent to the nominated lunch
organiser.</p><p>Based on hearsay and some cursory research on the Net, I
decided to use the following tools:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Javascript for the client end (the web page)</p></li><li><p>Python for the server side</p></li><li><p>Apache for the web server, which is distributed
with Linux (well, it was with my copy of Red Hat Linux 6.2); there
is also a Windows version, too, if one is so inclined</p></li><li><p>Linux for the web server OS</p></li></ul></div><p>In designing the web pages, I decided to keep it fairly
simple: a pull-down box with some radio buttons (see Figure 1).
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4141f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Snapshot of lunch.html
</p></div></div>

</p><p>I could have used some HTML editor but decided that I could
not handle learning another new package, so I did it by hand. Since
what I wanted to do wasn't complicated, the by-hand method proved
sufficient.</p><p>It was easy to install the web server using Linux. When I was
installing Linux, the option to install Apache was ticked. When I
typed in <b  >localhost</b> as the URL to Netscape, it
displayed the Apache page with the message that if I saw that page,
everything was A-Okay! Whoo-hooo... so far so good. (See
<a href="http://www.apache.org" target="_self">http://www.apache.org/</a>
for more details). You'll probably need to be root (the superuser)
to do the install.</p><p>Using Javascript to write a web page seems semi-obvious.
There are several functions for data input verification
(<b  >ValidLength()</b> and
<b  >ValidEmail()</b>). <b  >MenuHeader()</b>
displays the header part of the page. Each call to MenuEntry()
displays an input row. In this case, it is called four times, once
for each lunch order item (see Listing 1).</p><p><a href="4141l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>The most tricky lines would be the
<b  >ON-SUBMIT</b> statement:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;FORM NAME="order" onSubmit="return Validate();"
    ACTION="http://localhost/cgi-bin/lunch.cgi"
METHOD="POST"&gt;
</pre><p>There are two ways a web page can communicate with a CGI
script: <b  >GET</b> and <b  >POST</b>. In a
nutshell, GET sends the information as part of the URL (i.e., you
might have seen some URLs which resemble
http://localhost/script.cgi?param1=value1&amp;param2=value2 in your
surfing of the Internet). When POST is used, the form information
is sent via the standard input, i.e., the CGI script needs to read
in standard input, and then parse the input separate out the
various parameters.
</p><p>It is generally accepted that POST is better (more robust,
not limited by the maximum character limit of shell used). The
methods used to extract the data differ according to whether POST
or GET is used, but Python hides this from you (which is
good).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x160b580.0x17042c0"></a>Viewing lunch.html Via the Web Server</h2></div></div><p>I then placed the lunch.html file in the directory
/home/httpd/html:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cp lunch.html /home/httpd/html
</pre><p>(This is the default location Apache looks for html files. It
can be configured to look elsewhere.) Once you have done this, you
can see what lunch.html looks like by browsing
http://localhost/lunch.html using Netscape (or any browser).
</p><p>Write the CGI script with Python, which is distributed with
the Red Hat Linux distribution (see
<a href="http://www.python.org" target="_self">http://www.python.org/</a>).
After consulting the Python documentation, which also came with the
system, my first script looked like the one shown in Listing 3. It
is essentially a cannibalised version of an example found in the
Python documentation. To make use of this script, you'll need to
point the CGI script specified in the ACTION statement in the HTML
file to this script instead. That is, change the cgi script
specified in the ACTION statement from lunch.cgi to
first.cgi.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x160b580.0x1704528"></a>Testing the Installation</h2></div></div><p>I then copied first.cgi to the directory
/home/httpd/cgi-bin:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cp first.cgi /home/httpd/cgi-bin
</pre><p>Essentially, I interrogated all the variables sent to the
script by the form and printed it back out. All output printed will
be displayed by the browser.
<pre     class="programlisting">
#-----------------
 1 #!/usr/bin/env python
 2 # first.cgi
 3 import cgi                                   # import the cgi module
 4
 5 print "Content-Type: text/plain\n\n"       # necessary for the
browser
 6
 7 lunchForm = cgi.FieldStorage()               # retrieve the values
 8
 9 for name in lunchForm.keys():
10     print "Key= " + name + " Value= " +
lunchForm[name].value + " "
11
12 print "bye."
#-------------
</pre>


When the Go button on the lunch.html page is clicked and the
first.cgi script is activated, the output returned to the web
browser looks like that shown in Figure 2.
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4141f4.large.jpg"><img src="4141f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Output of Script
first.cgi</p></div></div>
</p><p>You will notice that the keys found in the CGI script
correspond to the variables I used in lunch.html.</p><p>Once I got this simple script working, I then expanded it to
do what I wanted (see Listing 3). The Python code is quite
straightforward and self-explanatory. It imports the CGI module,
then calls the member function
<span   class="bold"><b>FieldStorage()</b></span> of CGI. Whether the
information is sent using the GET or POST method is hidden from
you. That's how all the information sent by the web page is
retrieved. The information can then be extracted by accessing
lunchForm.</p><p><a href="4141l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>The body of the mail sent is then constructed via a series of
writes to sendmail, a UNIX sendmail mail transfer agent. I decided
to mail the lunch order to user lunch@localhost. An alias can be
inserted in file /etc/aliases:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
lunch:          chai@localhost
</pre><p>where user chai@localhost is organising the orders. This way,
if the lunch organiser gets changed, the file /etc/aliases needs to
be changed and not the CGI script.
(<span   class="bold"><b>newaliases</b></span> needs to be run for
changes to /etc/aliases to take effect).
</p><p>Easy, eh? Well, it could be much worse.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x160b580.0x1704cb8"></a>Hooking Everything Together</h2></div></div><p>I then copied lunch.cgi to the directory
/home/httpd/cgi-bin:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cp lunch.cgi /home/httpd/cgi-bin
</pre><p>I opened Netscape, typed in http://localhost/lunch.html as
the URL, filled in the form, selected my order and clicked on
&ldquo;Go&rdquo;.
</p><p>Sometime later, an e-mail arrived outlining the order.</p><p>Here is what the received e-mail of the lunch order, sent by
the CGI script, looks like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;From nobody@localhost  Wed Apr 26 11:01:50 2000&lt;\n&gt;

method? Debatable, but it certainly is more fun (at least for
me).</p><p>Improvements? The web page is geared towards an individual
making an order, as opposed to a person ordering for multiple
people. In hindsight, the web page could have been laid out with
the latter in mind, and, being a superset of the former, would
satisfy those requirements as well. A simple compromise could be
having a multiples box, which would allow a person to order more
than one serving of the same dish per order row. In the current
scheme, this would still only allow four different orders per
e-mail. So make it 10? 20? How long is a piece of rope?
(paraphrased to make it more sinister). A design problem left to
the reader.</p><p>I suppose I could also hook it into an SQL database
(<a href="http://www.mysql.org" target="_self">http://www.mysql.org/</a>)
and print out a histogram of the past orders for a particular
person. A by-product of using a database is that one could print
out reports, e.g., what is to be ordered for that week.</p><p>I suppose if there is enough interest and if I have enough
time, I'll add a second part to this system, where the CGI script
would interact with a SQL database and return HTML code to display
a frequency list. And, perhaps, with some cookie
interaction.</p><p>Finally, on a personal note, I've seen the future and it is
Python. Look it up (and JPython too!).</p><p><a href="4141s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
