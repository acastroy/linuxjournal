    If you're on a shopping trip for PC hardware, and you come across
    this magazine in your favorite computer store, read the hardware
    articles before you hit the aisles.

&ldquo;Doctor, it hurts when I do this.&rdquo;
</p><p>&ldquo;Well, don't do that, then,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p><p>Simple but good advice. In the world of Linux, many people
subject themselves to pain and suffering trying to get Linux to
work on crummy hardware, when they could just <span   class="emphasis"><em>not do
that</em></span>, and instead do some research
(<i  >LJ</i> is a great resource) to find hardware that
works well. That doesn't mean wizards who want to hack new drivers
shouldn't try to get Linux working on bad, even pathologically
stupid, hardware if they want. But if you're planning to get a new
web server on the Net by Monday, don't start grabbing random crap
off the shelf at Discount Computer Land on Sunday night.</p><p>If you're on a shopping trip for PC hardware, and you come
across this magazine in your favorite computer store, read the
hardware articles before you hit the aisles. Picking high-quality,
Linux-compatible parts will save you a lot of time and effort, and
will encourage the hardware vendors to test their stuff with Linux
in the first place. Buy the magazine afterward, though. If you
promise to buy the magazine and the store people say &ldquo;Hey, this
isn't a library,&rdquo; you can point them to this:</p><p>Hello, nice computer store person. Please let this customer
read the hardware articles because he or she promises to buy the
magazine, and you might sell some hardware, too. Thank you.</p><p>The Duron is the &ldquo;cheap version&rdquo; of AMD's Athlon CPU. It's
not as fast as the fastest Athlons or Pentium IIIs, it doesn't have
as much cache, but it is very usable in a good basic desktop
machine that runs StarOffice, the GIMP or your favorite development
tools. ASL, Inc. has built a respectable Linux workstation around
Duron, with top-quality parts and performance that's more than
adequate for almost everyone.</p><p>Everyone, that is, except people who want the current
top-of-the-line Linux machine. Jason Collins, Mike Higashi, Sam
Ockman and I sat down for a fine dinner at Taqueria Los Charros in
Mountain View to discuss hot hardware, cool cases and fans, and we
got some good recommendations from Eric Raymond and Darryl Strauss,
too. So check out the article if you're building a no-compromises
workstation, and if you're ever in Mountain View, I recommend the
super carnitas burrito.</p><p>Thinking of dual booting? Well, don't. If you're seriously
into learning Linux, don't handicap yourself by putting it on a
spare partition on the same machine with all your legacy stuff. The
First Law of Dual Booting states that &ldquo;The application you need is
always on the other OS.&rdquo; So where do you put Linux? On a cheap but
stable Linux system, naturally. Jason Schumaker took a savage
journey into the heart of the cheap hardware market, and emerged
with &ldquo;Return of Revenge of the Killer $800 Linux Box&rdquo;--a good
selection of high-quality parts that are trouble-free with any
Linux software you care to name. That is more than you can say for
most PC vendor's low-end desktop box du jour. Whether you're
building a cheap box to learn Linux or building a main machine on a
budget, Jason's selection is a good place to start.</p><p><a href="4328s1.html" target="_self">Feature Articles on
