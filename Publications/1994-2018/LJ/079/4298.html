<i  >Linux Journal</i> motivated me to get my Samba
tuned up and running right.</p><p>I also use NT 4.0 so there were some differences, and I ended
up using a web article:
<a href="http://www-4.ibm.com/software/developer/library/samba" target="_self">www-4.ibm.com/software/developer/library/samba</a>,
by Daniel Robbins.</p><p>I realize you were describing your experiences with Red Hat
5.2. Your article did not describe what version of Samba you were
discussing. I upgraded to 2.0.7 (RH wtmp).</p><p>One of the areas with which I had trouble was that Samba
seems to take the first, or perhaps a random stab, at the interface
on which it will run. The first try used my external DSL
interface&mdash;not what I wanted. I found, in the Robbins article
discussed above, that you could specify a global of interface =
eth1 and that solved problem. Your article did not hint at the
possible problem.</p><p>Robbins also recommended the use of &ldquo;guest&rdquo; rather than
&ldquo;nobody&rdquo;, and that too solved a problem of the explorer not being
able to see shares, even though net use/view could. PS: not many of
the references discuss Internet use as did your article.</p><p>Thanks for getting me motivated.</p><p>&mdash;Paul Campbell seapwc@halcyon.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b4f580.0x1c474a8"></a>Artists' Guide to Linux Desktop</h2></div></div><p>I enjoyed Michael Hammel's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Forum</em></span> series,
&ldquo;The Artists' Guide to the Linux Desktop&rdquo;. Having explored window
managers in much the same way as Hammel, I was pleased to discover
that someone else on planet Earth had reached similar conclusions
about their various merits and defaults.</p><p>I would, though, like to point out an inaccuracy in Hammel's
discussion of FVWM2. I imagine he'll thank me for it. FVWM2 does
not, as he states, require the user to restart the window manager
whenever a menu is changed. FVWM's &ldquo;Read&rdquo; command will reread and
install the altered version of a menu file without requiring a
window manager restart. The &ldquo;Read&rdquo; command, like all FVWM
commands, can be bound to a menu, pop-up, key press, or mouse
click. It can also be embedded in a function. The only thing to
beware of is that the menu file should begin by destroying itself
and any submenus (&ldquo;DestroyMenu &lt;name&gt;&rdquo;). Otherwise, the
&ldquo;Read&rdquo; command will concatenate the new version with the
old.</p><p>&mdash;Peter Schaffter df191@ncf.ca</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b4f580.0x1c476b8"></a>Ads and Content</h2></div></div><p>This is a reply to the letter from Tirath in the August
issue. I think he is off base to complain about advertising in
<i  >LJ</i>. The rise of advertising has not harmed the
editorial content as far as I can tell. In fact, it seems to me
there is more editorial content than ever.</p><p>Far from being &ldquo;junk&rdquo;, as he call them, the ads let us know
what companies, products and services are available to get things
done in a Linux environment. In addition to the high information
value of these ads, they also highlight the growing support for the
Linux community and for <i  >LJ</i> in particular.
These companies are helping <i  >LJ</i> to grow by the
money they spend on advertising. Furthermore, by releasing products
and services, they are helping Linux to grow. In my opinion,
<i  >LJ</i> is a perfect venue to make known such
products and services. We ought to do business with these companies
whenever possible.</p><p>&mdash;Bryan S.

was shocked to see the international subscription price in the
August issue. It appears to have risen from $37 to $62 per year. I
understand that distribution costs are involved, however this seems
a large increase, considering the cover price remains the same. I
would appreciate your comments.</p><p>&mdash;Brian Galbraith brian.galbraith@bigfoot.com</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Ever increasing postage rates and increased paper
and production costs have forced us to raise our international
subscription prices in order to keep offering them. Over the past
few years,</em></span> <i  >Linux Journal</i> has lost a substantial amount
of money on these subscriptions and, therefore, had to make a
decision to increase rates to bring us close to a break-even point.
We sincerely wish we did not have to pass this cost along to our
international subscribers, but it was the only way we could
continue to offer these subscriptions.</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b4f580.0x1c47ce8"></a>(Not So) WordPerfect Office 2000 Review</h2></div></div><p>I have some disagreements with Jon Valesh's review of
WordPerfect Office 2000. Nearly the first page and a half was
devoted to the politics of office suite development for Linux. I'm
not a big Microsoft fan either, but I buy software based on whether
it effectively solves an existing need. I'm frustrated by having to
reboot to Windows to deal with spreadsheets and documents that I
have to use for my job...the question is whether Corel can help me
solve this problem.</p><p>Mr. Valesh had very few installation problems. My experience
was the opposite. Installation under SuSE 6.3 was a nightmare. I'll
omit the details in the interest of time, but even after
installation, the software regularly crashed or froze. I noticed
that Corel's latest ad in your magazine mentions compatibility with
&ldquo;major&rdquo; Linux distributions, but no longer specifically mentions
SuSE. (On the software packaging, SuSE is mentioned as a compatible
distribution.) This actually reminds me of my past experiences with
Microsoft&mdash;get the product out now, whether it works or not, and
then fix it later. And no, I certainly don't expect reviewers to
try software on each Linux distribution, but it might not be a bad
idea for the software developers.</p><p>I've switched to Linux-Mandrake 7.1, and I tried WP Office
2000 again with better results. However, there are still some major
annoyances. For example, when I hit &ldquo;File/Open&rdquo;, the dialog box
opens <span   class="emphasis"><em>behind</em></span> the document window. Mr. Valesh
calls these problems &ldquo;idiosyncrasies&rdquo;. I call them annoying bugs.
I wish the review had focused more on how the software works, and
less on installation and philosophy. Then, people could make an
informed decision on whether to purchase the product.</p><p>Meanwhile, I'm hoping that Corel offers some kind of an
upgrade deal to registered users when they finally get the
&ldquo;idiosyncrasies&rdquo; fixed. &mdash;Jim
Mueller jmueller@advancenet.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b4f580.0x1c47f50"></a>Font for Letters Column</h2></div></div><p>I would just like to point out that using a sans-serif font
for the Letters section of <i  >LJ</i> is not the best
choice; more and more letters are including URLs, file names, or
other pieces of verbatim text where it is important to distinguish
between capital &ldquo;I&rdquo; and lowercase &ldquo;L&rdquo;. The August Letters, for
instance, contains two references to the iclint rpogram, one as
simply &ldquo;Iclint&rdquo; and one as
&rdquo;http://Iclint.cs.virginia.edu&rdquo;.</p><p>If you're reading this message in a mail reader that happens
to use a sans-serif font, then you've probably gotten the point
already. If not, let me recast those as &ldquo;#c#int&rdquo; and
&ldquo;http://#c#int.cs.virginia.edu&rdquo;, and pose you the hypothetical
question of how you would feel about that letter if you'd never
heard of iclint before, and had no idea whether you were reading
about something called &ldquo;lclint&rdquo;, &ldquo;lcIint&rdquo;, &ldquo;Iclint&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;IcIint&rdquo;. If it were me, knowing that most stuff in UNIX is
case-sensitive, and knowing that host names are case-insensitive,
I'd probably think you meant &ldquo;lclint&rdquo;, in which case I would be
pretty frustrated if I tried to access that web site.</p><p>The same logic, of course, applies throughout your magazine,
but I spotted it in the &ldquo;Letters&rdquo; column, so that's what I'm
griping about.</p><p>&mdash;Cloister Bell cloister@hhhh.org</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b4f580.0x1c481b8"></a>June 2000 Issue</h2></div></div><p>I was excited when I felt how thick the June issue of
<i  >LJ</i> was, but when I opened it, I was a bit
disappointed, ho hum how boring&mdash;well not all of it. But I long for
the days when <i  >LJ</i> used to feature exciting
events and accomplishments like Robots, Linear Accelerators,
etc.</p><p>I am sure you know <span   class="emphasis"><em>Byte</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Circuit Cellar Ink</em></span> and its history; how about
starting a section related to electronics and interfacing with
Linux, various embedded hardware, etc.?</p><p>&mdash;Ross Linder ross@mecalc.co.za</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Ross, you are in luck. We have been watching the
embedded use of Linux grow and have decided to seriously address
it. The September 2000</em></span> <i  >LJ</i> focused on the embedded use of
Linux. We also have a special supplement that will be mailed to our
subscribers in October with a new magazine to follow in 2001.

&ldquo;Linux Finance Programs Review&rdquo; (August 2000). I was relieved to
find I am not the only one who is addicted to Quicken. There seems
to be plenty of support on your side of the Atlantic.</p><p>I am currently trying to make a transformation from using
&ldquo;The Other Operating System&rdquo; to Linux. I have two problems. One
that I can do nothing about is my employer's use of NT, and a need
to work at home. The other is that I do not seem to be able to
manage without Quicken, and there does not appear to be a viable
alternative for Linux.</p><p>Ralph Krause has done an excellent review of the
possibilities, but none of them sounds like a viable full
alternative. Each has some of the functions of Quicken, but not
all. None seem to deal with an investment portfolio at all.</p><p>As you presumably know, Quicken is written here in England by
Intuit Ltd. I have just written to them to ask when (not if!) they
intend to port Quicken to Linux, drawing their attention to your
articles. I will let you know when (or if) I get any
response.</p><p>&mdash;David R. Hignett Hignett@dial.pipex.co.uk</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b4f580.0x1c48898"></a>September 2000 Issue</h2></div></div><p>I have used Linux for about five years now, starting with a
simple umsdos installation. I have no computer training, and so at
times it has been a struggle. The people involved in the
&ldquo;movement&rdquo; have fascinated me as much as the system, and have
made it fun to participate even in my little way. Your recent
forays into presenting those personalities have been fun for me,
and I particularly enjoyed this first installment with Phil Hughes.

response from some of your readers to the picture on the front of
the Python Supplement (May 2000). Such a picture would barely raise
an eyebrow here in Australia!</p><p>I find it to be a never-ending source of wonder that a nation
that consumes so much of the world's resources and gives so little
back in return can occupy itself so completely with this kind of
moralistic debate. If the Puritan heart of middle America still
can't reconcile themselves to the fact that the price of freedom is
tolerance, then I strongly suggest they hand in their
semi-automatic weapons and 454 cubic-inch pick-ups!</p><p>We have nothing to fear from depictions of the human body,
only from the mindsets of those who want to use such images to
peddle their simpilistic, narrow-minded views of the world.</p><p>&mdash;Arthur Watts arthur.watts@gbst.com</p><p>I know we promised we had published the last of the responses
to the naked cover, but we couldn't resist.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b4f580.0x1c48c60"></a>Disgusted</h2></div></div><p>In reference to the letter titled &ldquo;Disgusted&rdquo; in your
September issue:</p><p>While I'm not as outraged as Dale Lakes, I must say I'm
deeply disappointed to find out <i  >Linux Journal</i>
is using NT and IIS for anything. I realize you may be having
problems coming up with a Linux solution, but just think of the
field day Microsoft is going to have when they find out that one of
the largest &ldquo;Voices&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Linux Community&rdquo; runs their
e-commerce site off of NT and IIS, because they can't find a
suitable Linux alternative.</p><p>&mdash;Howard Pepper hpepper@mindspring.com</p></div></div>
