    One short year ago, &ldquo;embedded Linux&rdquo; barely existed,
    from a commercial
    perspective.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x245c580.0x2554558"></a></h2></div></div><p> One short year ago, &ldquo;embedded Linux&rdquo;
barely existed, from a commercial perspective. August's
150,000-square-foot LinuxWorld conference (San Jose, California)
clearly demonstrated how far embedded Linux has come in just a
dozen months. Better than one in ten of the more than 160
exhibitors rolled out new products and services aimed at embedded
Linux developers and applications. In case you missed the show,
here's a brief summary about each of the exhibitors who highlighted
embedded Linux in one way or another.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Adomo</b></span> previewed an easily
expandable, easily administered Linux-based home information system
that offers fast access to information along with the ability to
communicate easily. The system consists of a Linux-based home
server and a network of thin terminal devices that provide access
to information, Internet-based services, and group oriented
applications.
(<a href="http://www.adomo.com" target="_self">http://www.adomo.com/</a>)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Agenda Computing</b></span> previewed
the Agenda VR3, a new Linux-based handheld PC that will be
introduced to the market this fall at a base price of $149 (US).
The device, which is based on an NEC VR4181 system-on-chip
processor, features an open source operating system and will be
supported by a web-based open application development community.
(<a href="http://www.agendacomputing.com" target="_self">http://www.agendacomputing.com/</a>)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Applied Data Systems</b></span> showed
a number of single-board computers (SBCs) that are oriented towards
solving the embedded display challenges of companies developing a
wide range of embedded system products. Demos included a new
Linux-based on-board interactive computer system being installed on
golf carts; ViewML, Century Software's new embedded Linux browser,
running on the 4'' x 6'' ADS Graphics Client StrongARM based
single-board computer (SBC); and a &ldquo;sneak preview&rdquo; of ADS' new
3'' x 4'' &ldquo;Bitsy&rdquo;, StrongARM-based SBC, running Linux of course.
(<a href="http://www.flatpanels.com" target="_self">http://www.flatpanels.com/</a>)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Computer I/O</b></span> unveiled a
unique embedded software and services &ldquo;middleware solution&rdquo; for
the communications industry. The software enables Microsoft Windows
clients to communicate transparently with Linux-based embedded data
acquisition servers, without concern for operating system, network
compatibility, or protocols.
(<a href="http://www.computerio.com" target="_self">http://www.computerio.com/</a>)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Emperor Systems Software</b></span>
showed several examples of Internet appliance applications running
on top of their embedded Linux and JAVA software technologies,
including: &ldquo;TV-Linux&rdquo;, a TV set-top box solution; and
&ldquo;Studio-Linux&rdquo;, a broadband server solution for interactive
television.
(<a href="http://www.tvlinux.com" target="_self">http://www.tvlinux.com/</a>)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>IBM</b></span> showed a wide range of
Linux-based systems, from massive million-dollar systems, to the
incredibly tiny embedded Linux wristwatch. IBM also demonstrated
some new Linux-based Thin Client systems, and also announced
availability of its VisualAge Micro Edition Java Virtual Machine
for embedded Linux systems.
(<a href="http://www.ibm.com/linux" target="_self">http://www.ibm.com/linux/</a>)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Indrema</b></span> promoted its
upcoming embedded Linux-based TV set-top gaming console and game
software developer network. The company issued a press release
announcing the launch of its collaborative open game development
initiative, and also announced two key strategic relationships, one
with Red Hat (&ldquo;Red Hat and Indrema Establish Linux Distribution
for Console Video Gaming and Home Entertainment&rdquo;) and the other,
with Linuxcare (&ldquo;Linuxcare and Indrema Team to Provide Embedded
Linux Support for Video Game Market&rdquo;).
(<a href="http://www.indrema.com" target="_self">http://www.indrema.com/</a>)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Infomatec</b></span> showed several
example Internet appliance applications, including a set-top box
and a webpad, that demonstrated typical products based on the
company's Linux kernel based Java Network Technology (JNT)
operating system technology.
(<a href="http://www.infomatec.com" target="_self">http://www.infomatec.com/</a>)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Intel</b></span> demonstrated embedded
Linux running on a wide variety of board-level computers, including
a small Taiwan-manufactured Pentium-based embedded single-board
computer.
(<a href="http://developer.intel.com" target="_self">http://developer.intel.com/</a>)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ISDCorp</b></span> although ISDCorp was
recently acquired by LynuxWorks, ISDCorp still had their own booth,
where they showcased the broad array of Royal Linux support for ARM
and MIPS processors. Demos showed Royal Linux running on the Intel
SA-1100, Cirrus 7200; LinkUp 7200, TI R4000, Toshiba 3912, NEC
VR4121, and a Vadem Clio handheld PC.
(<a href="http://www.isdcorp.com" target="_self">http://www.isdcorp.com/</a>)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Lineo</b></span> showed a large array
of eye-catching demonstrations featuring the company's Embedix
Linux operating system. These included: Embedix RealTime, with the
Linux Trace Toolkit; the Embedix SDK, with Target Wizard; Embedix
running on the new Motorola MBX2000 embedded Pentium II-based SBC;
Embedix GUI, running on a TV set-top box; uClinux, running on a
Coldfire 5307 board in a demo that played MP3s on a pair of
speakers and also controlled five robotic servo motors; uClinux,
running on the tiny (SIMM-sized) &ldquo;uCsimm&rdquo; Dragonball-based SBC
with its video displayed on a full-sized VGA LCD; and Embedix Linux
with Embedix GUI, running a simulated automated teller machine
application on an Advantech touch-screen computer. Lineo handed out
free bootable floppies containing Atomic RTAI, an open-source
functional real-time Linux distribution that fits on a single
floppy diskette, and also made several new product announcements
including: Embedix Real-time, High Availability Cluster support,
and support for Embedix development on Windows hosts.
(<a href="http://www.lineo.com" target="_self">http://www.lineo.com/</a>)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>LynuxWorks</b></span>, in addition to
all the Royal Linux demos at the ISDCorp booth, LynuxWorks showed
BlueCat Linux running three demos in their own booth. BlueCat Linux
cross-development was demonstrated, showing the capability to
support multiple embedded processor families at once, with the
targets Internet-attached and controlled remotely from one host
(using Rlogin). A second demo illustrated compatibility between
LynxOS (a proprietary POSIX-compliant RTOS) and BlueCat Linux: it
consisted of a pair of Motorola's new MBX2000 EBX SBCs&mdash;one running
BlueCat, and the other running LynxOS&mdash;and showed how the same
Linux multimedia application ('GIMP' could run equivalently on
either OS. A third setup demonstrated high availability and
fail-over capabilities, in the form of a chess game: a browser on a
PC provided graphical display of the chess board; the chess program
itself ran as a server on a pair of redundant system controllers;
when the first controller fails, the alternate one automatically
takes over the server function and thereby provides uninterrupted
operation. Pretty expensive chess game!
(<a href="http://www.lynuxworks.com" target="_self">http://www.lynuxworks.com/</a>)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Metro Link</b></span> showed their
ability to develop custom embedded Linux-based graphics display
solutions and technologies. One such technology is Micro-X, a
scalable X server implementation for embedded systems and consumer
electronics. In addition, Metro Link disclosed several new products
that are currently in development, including a home information
management technology suite, multimedia tools, and 3D rendering
software (derived from OpenGL).
(<a href="http://www.metrolink.com" target="_self">http://www.metrolink.com/</a>)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>MontaVista</b></span> beneath the
shadow of huge, suspended renditions of the company's signature
hard-hat-wearing penguin and Kerbango's Internet radio, was a
dizzying array of demonstrations of Hard Hat Linux and its
features. IBM's VisualAge Micro Edition embedded JVM, riding on top
of MontaVista's Hard Hat Linux was shown on an Embedded Planet
&ldquo;Linux Planet&rdquo; demo systems, running various touch screen
interfaces and games. Ziatech (recently acquired by Intel) was
demonstrating their unique &ldquo;Ketris&rdquo; CompactPCI hot swap and CPU
fail-over technology, running on Hard Hat Linux of course. The
Microwindows embedded GUI and windowing system, along with the
ViewML browser, were shown running on MIPS, StrongARM, and PowerPC
processors. Hard Hat Linux and its new Cross-Development Tools and
Integrated Development Environment were demonstrated on the tiny
Intrinsyc CerfBoard (serving web pages), on the IBM's PowerPC 405GP
&ldquo;Walnut&rdquo; evaluation board, on Bus-Tech's 1U configurable
rackmount appliance, on the new Motorola MBX2000 EBX form-factor
SBC, and on an Intel &ldquo;PICA&rdquo; (x86) platform. Kerbango's Internet
Radio (with Hard Hat Linux inside) provided audio entertainment,
streaming audio broadcasts from Real Audio servers around the
world. Finally, if you happened to drop by the booth at the right
moment, you were treated to a really cool demo: a Compaq iPAQ
running Hard Hat Linux and the Microwindows GUI, complete with
handwriting recognition.
(<a href="http://www.mvista.com" target="_self">http://www.mvista.com/</a>)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Motorola Computer Group</b></span> took
the wraps off their new highly integrated yet compact single-board
computer, the MBX2000, in the EBX (5.75'' x 8.0'') embedded
computer form-factor. The MBX2000 is based on a low power version
of Intel's Pentium II processor (in BGA1 chip packaging), and
includes a display controller and Ethernet interface, along with a
long list of additional I/O ports. On the software side, Motorola
announced a partnership with Red Hat to support the high
availability requirements of telecom applications.
(<a href="http://www.motorola.com/linux)" target="_self">www.motorola.com/linux)</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Synergy Microsystems</b></span>
demonstrated Linux running on their PowerPC-based VME and
CompactPCI CPU boards, and announced an agreement to offer TimeSys'
Linux/RT on Synergy's products.
(<a href="http://www.synergymicro.com" target="_self">http://www.synergymicro.com/</a>)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>TimeSys</b></span> three demonstrations
acquainted booth visitors with the Linux/RT operating system
associated tools. A demo of the quality of service (QoS)
capabilities of Linux/RT showed what happens to streaming video
from a USB camera when processes are added to a system&mdash;with, and
without, QoS parameters enabled. A second demo showed the
capabilities of three new TimeSys tools&mdash;TimeTrace, TimeWiz, and
TimeWarp&mdash;including modeling system scheduler performance under
varying &ldquo;what if&rdquo; conditions. In a third demo, a Motorola
Pentium-based CompactPCI computer board was operated as an embedded
target system, and ran Linux/RT out of flash memory.
(<a href="http://www.timesys.com" target="_self">http://www.timesys.com/</a>)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Transvirtual Technologies</b></span>
you could hardly get near Transvirtual's booth! What was all the
excitement about? Transvirtual was demonstrating its new
PocketLinux OS, an open-source embedded Linux implementation that
runs on PDAs like the Compaq iPAQ and VTech Helio.
(<a href="http://www.transvirtual.com" target="_self">http://www.transvirtual.com/</a>)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Trolltech</b></span> announced a
graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit and windowing system for
embedded Linux based devices, called Qt/Embedded. In its smallest
configuration, Qt/Embedded loads from just 700K of ROM (disk).
(<a href="http://www.trolltech.com" target="_self">http://www.trolltech.com/</a>)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ZF Linux Devices</b></span> showcased
the company's MachZ X86 system-on-chip processor and associated
development tools and platforms. One cool demo consisted of a very
small self-contained computer board bearing the MachZ, several
active components, and a small LCD display. Another demo showed the
MachZ Integrated Development System; the system contains an ATX
form-factor PC-compatible motherboard based on the MachZ
system-on-chip processor, plus PCI plug-in cards for video and
networking, and serves as a convenient evaluation and development
environment. A third demo highlighted the new zPortPC Home Internet
Appliance system&mdash;an aesthetically packaged device intended to
serve as a small, cost-effective platform for a wide range of
Internet appliance applications. Choose your favorite color from a
rainbow of options!
