<b  >mod_layout</b> began as a need. Around 1997, I was
working on a web site called the Virtual Hospital
(<a href="http://www.vh.org" target="_self">http://www.vh.org/</a>). At the
time, we were using Netscape's Fast Track server. I really wanted
to switch over to Apache but had to overcome two hurdles. First, we
had to get management to accept that it would be easy to find
people who knew how to configure Apache (Netscape's graphical
interface seemed to create a belief that it would be easy to
configure and maintain) and, second, Netscape could do footers. The
Netscape server supports footers by allowing you to arbitrarily add
HTML to the end of any document that it is processing. This is far
from perfect, but it serves the basic needs of most sites.
</p><p>The first hurdle was easy to clear, seeing how we had to edit
the Netscape server's configuration file consistently, and with so
little documentation available on its file format, we found that
maintenance quickly became a chore.</p><p>The second problem was solved by creating a custom handler.
The solution was a small application written in C that was called
for every HTML document. While this worked, it had a number of
problems. For example, we now had an application being run a couple
of times every second. This also didn't solve the problem of our
CGI scripts, which still had to be modified so their output matched
that of the HTML handler. This was far from an ideal
solution.</p><p>I kept running into similar problems as I worked on different
web sites. Someone would come along and want copyrights, headers or
something similar applied to all documents on their site, and,
typically, they would present me with yet another new web site
technology for creating content. They would also want to do this
without changing the content of their site, and it had to be easy
to update and modify.</p><p>To answer these demands, I created
<span   class="bold"><b>ModLayout</b></span>. ModLayout determines
whether to handle a document by looking at the handler and mime
type. For instance, if you wish to handle PHP4 scripts, you would
use the directive <b  >LayoutHandler</b> with the
argument <b  >application/x-http-php</b>. ModLayout
handles most of the common MIME types without the need to specify
the handler in Apache's configuration file; these can be disabled
with &ldquo;LayoutDefaultHandlers Off&rdquo;, and you can then add back in
what you want to have wrapped. Often sites will have specific
documents that they don't want wrapped. For this, you can use the
directive &ldquo;LayoutIgnoreURI&rdquo;, and there are also ignore directives
for removing only the header, footer or HTTP header.</p><p>ModLayout provides three additional stages to the Apache
process. It provides a header stage, a footer stage and a stage for
doing HTTP headers. If you need to create HTTP headers dynamically
for all documents, ModLayout will let you do this. Headers and
footers occur on the HTML page before and after the original
document.</p><p>There are three types of headers and footers. You can either
add a simple piece of text:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
LayoutHeader "Sample header"
LayoutFooter "Sample Footer"
</pre><p>or you can insert entire files by using:
<pre     class="programlisting">
LayoutHeader /usr/local/apache/htdocs/header.html
LayoutFooter /usr/local/apache/htdocs/footer.html
</pre>


or by URI:
<pre     class="programlisting">
LayoutHeader /header.pl
LayoutFooter /footer.php
</pre>


The above examples will work when you have simple requirements for
headers and footers. The first two examples also work well because
their content is cached in the Apache process. If you need
something that is dynamic, however, you can use the URI example.
ModLayout does not care about the type of URI used, it can be
anything from simple CGIs and SSI to complex applications written
in Perl, PHP or Java. Custom modules written in C using the Apache
API can also be used. If you desire to just use only HTML but not
have it cached, you can simply specify its URI and not its full
path. ModLayout also provides additional environment variables for
URIs being called as headers and footers. These supply information
about the state of the original document. One of ModLayout's great
advantages is that it works with any form of content and is
language neutral.
</p><p>A common use of ModLayout is to attach a copyright notice to
all of the documents on a site. To do this, you could use the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;VirtualHost www.example.com&gt;
     &lt;...insert normal content..&gt;
     LayoutFooter "&lt;P&gt;Copyright Example.com 1995-200"
     LayoutHandler "application/x-httpd-php"
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre><p>The above would insert the text at the bottom of every
document on the www.example.com virtual host for all of the default
handlers, including HTML pages and CGI scripts, and also on any
PHP4 script present.
</p><p>If you want to tack on the date the original document was
last modified, you could insert the following into a PHP document,
and save it as last-modified.php.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?php
     echo("Copyright 2000 FooBar INC. &lt;BR&gt; Last Modified");
     echo ($LAYOUT_LAST_MODIFIED);
?&gt;
</pre><p>and change the LayoutFooter directive to /last_modified.php.
</p><p>Now, let's look at a more complex problem. Let's say you
wanted to create a custom look and feel for a given site that was
enforced by the web server, the following would serve as an
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;VirtualHost www.example.com&gt;
     &lt;...insert normal content..&gt;
     LayoutHeader "/header.php"
     LayoutFooter "/footer.pl"
     LayoutIgnoreHeaderURI "/index.html"
     LayoutHandler "application/x-httpd-php"
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre><p>In the above example, the site would have a custom header
created by a PHP script and a Perl script running as the footer.
All default handlers are wrapped along with any PHP scripts that
are on the site. Notice that the index.html document will not be
wrapped though, since most sites have a custom front page but want
to have a default look for internal pages on the site. You can also
use something like mod_random and its random quote feature to
create your own banner ad system.
</p><p>When using mod_random, the thing to remember when creating
headers is that you need to be careful not to create invalid HTML
(which, thankfully, most browsers will handle). But, if you are
enforcing a look and feel on pages that outside users are creating,
they can easily end up with a messy output.</p><p>Keep in mind that inserting any HTML before a page with
frames will break the frames. At the moment, the solution most
people employ is to use footers and/or create floating Javascript
boxes). In a future version, you will be able to turn off headers,
footers and wrapped content by directives received from a URI that
is called from a header or footer.</p><p>For sites that have a more complex need, see Listing
1.</p><p><a href="4334l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>The example provided in Listing 1 is currently used for
<a href="http://www.tangent.org" target="_self">http://www.tangent.org/</a>.
This allows for web site document wrapping which affects the main
document root content but leaves user's home pages alone. While the
entire site uses the same footer, the header has been changed for
different sections. <span   class="bold"><b>ModRandom</b></span> is
used for inserting random quotes into the footers (thankfully these
are just from <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Simpsons</em></span> and nothing
annoying, like an ad banner).</p><p>Controlling ModLayout with Directory, Virtualhost and
Location tags, allows you to work out some fairly complicated
logic. You can also control what creates the HTTP headers through
<span   class="bold"><b>LayoutHTTPOverride</b></span> and by creating
your own dynamic HTTP headers with
<span   class="bold"><b>LayoutHTTPHeader</b></span>. At the moment,
there are about 24 total directives and ModLayout is under fairly
active development, (developer releases occur about once a month
and full releases about every two months). Feature suggestions are
encouraged, and there is a mailing list for discussing features,
HOWTOs and bugs. For more information, check out the Modlayout home
page,
<a href="http://tangent.org/mod_layout" target="_self">http://tangent.org/mod_layout/</a>.</p><p>Although ModLayout began as a solution to a problem that I
kept running into, today it is very much the result of people
writing in and requesting new features. It's future direction will
pretty much depend on what people ask for and need.</p></div></div>
