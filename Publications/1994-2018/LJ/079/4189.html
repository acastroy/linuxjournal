    &ldquo;Complexity must be grown from simple systems that already work.&rdquo; &mdash;Kevin Kelly
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e6580.0x19de4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Software engineers should look to their
hardware counterparts for approaches to managing complexity. Before
the advent of Integrated Circuits, electronic circuits were
generally complex creatures with many interconnected discrete
components. The complexity of the circuit was visible, difficult to
manage and adversely affected the cost of products. With the advent
of ICs much of this complexity was hidden inside the chips
themselves. The job of designing complex functionality into
products became much easier.
</p><p>Despite many attempts over the years, software design has
never been able to replicate this IC design paradigm. The advent of
object-oriented programming languages and tools was supposed to
address some of these issues. While object-oriented design offers
some significant improvements in areas such as GUI programming it
doesn't always do a great job of hiding complexity. In fact, they
often simply shift the complexity into other areas in the software
development chain such as testing, toolsets, class library design
or the learning curve.</p><p>Modern hardware design requires a complex skillset. What the
advent of ICs did, however, was allow the hardware designer to use
a given chip in a product design without having to understand the
exact physics and layout of the circuits contained within the chip
itself. As long as the designer conformed to the specs at the
external interface to the chip (pins) the chip will react in a very
predictable manner. This is what encapsulation of complexity
offers: complexity hiding and predictable/reproducible behavior.
Objects in software design offer partial complexity hiding, but the
software designer often still has to know and master a complex
language (e.g., C++) in order to be able to wire objects together
into a product. Objects are very poor at providing predictable and
reproducible software behavior. Furthermore, the language of the
objects themselves often dictates the language used to &ldquo;wire them
together&rdquo;. In our opinion, true encapsulation of complexity behind
a universally simple and extendable API is what is required to
produce a software IC. The software designer should not have to
master a complex object-oriented language and toolset in order to
be able to &ldquo;wire together&rdquo; these software ICs. At the very least
the software designer should be able to choose the wiring language
independent of the chip language.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e6580.0x19de660"></a>Process Encapsulation</h2></div></div><p>Many RTOSes have pioneered the use of user-space processes as
an encapsulation scheme. One of the oldest to use this scheme is
QNX TM
(<a href="http://www.qnx.com" target="_self">http://www.qnx.com/</a>).
Since 1980, QNX has released a continuous series of innovative OSes
that were based upon a set of cooperating processes all using a
Send/Receive/Reply messaging paradigm. QNX's approach to kernel
design differs greatly from that used in Linux and we do not wish
to reinflame the infamous microkernel vs. monolithic kernel debate.
Suffice to say that we believe that the process model and the
Send/Receive/Reply messaging paradigm first pioneered by QNX offers
the key ingredients of a successful software IC.
</p><p>In most modern operating systems, including Linux, the
process is a very robust computing entity. There are several layers
of protection offered to a process and the resources it embraces
when running on a processor. It is very difficult for two processes
to inadvertently adversely affect one another. If a given process
encounters a fatal bug and crashes, it is rare that the entire
system will be compromised. So the userispace process in Linux
offers us a great container for our software IC. Now all we need is
the software analog of the pins. This is where the messaging
paradigm comes in.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e6580.0x19de818"></a>Tokenized Messaging</h2></div></div><p>One of the most powerful message formats is also one of the
simplest. We can view a message as simply a collection of bytes.
This collection of bytes is divided into two parts. The first field
of bytes which is of fixed length is always present in every
message and taken together, these bytes represent a unique message
identifier called a token. The balance of the message (which can be
of variable length) represents the token context-sensitive data.
When two processes wish to exchange such messages they simply agree
on a token scheme and on the format for each tokenized message they
want to exchange. The interprocess message transport layer need not
be concerned at all with the message content.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e6580.0x19dead8"></a>Message Synchronization</h2></div></div><p>One of the goals of any software design is to produce
software which behaves predictably and reproducibly under a given
stimulus. Many object-oriented and message-oriented design
paradigms suffer because they introduce a degree of
unpredictability and randomness into a software product. If a
message is exchanged with a mailbox scheme and the sender and the
receiver are never brought into synchronization it will be
exceedingly difficult to replicate or predict all possible states
that two process system can be in. Much depends on the environment
and timing considerations in which these two processes find
themselves. These modules may work fine in one environment and
suffer sporadic failures in another. This leads to increased
testing and maintenance costs and a poorer software product. Often
the blame is incorrectly directed at the multiprocess design
paradigm. How often have we heard it said that client/server
software design does not handle complexity well. The original
designers of Send/Receive/Reply synchronized messaging believed
that the answer lies in forcing a state-machine-like
synchronization to occur on each message pass.
</p><p>It works like this: a sending process composes a message and
arranges to send it to a receiving process. While waiting for a
reply the sending process is blocked. The receiving process, on the
other hand, is held blocked until a message arrives destined for
it. It unblocks, reads the message, processes its contents and then
replies to the sender. This reply then unblocks the sender and the
two processes are free to operate independently once again.</p><p>Many have argued that this blocking/forced synchronization
introduces unnecessary complexity into a message exchange, but when
properly applied it achieves exactly the opposite effect. By
forcing synchronization to occur at each message pass, one finds
that our multi-process applications now start to behave in a very
predictable and reproducible manner. Gone are the timing and
environmental effects that often plague nonsynchronized message
passing schemes. When dealing with huge complex applications, this
represents a huge strategic advantage. As an added bonus, since the
sender is blocked during message transmission and is explicitly
unblocked by the receiver process with the reply, it is very simple
to arrange to transport these messages over a variety of media
(including some which are &ldquo;slow&rdquo;). The messages could be
exchanged via shared memory if the processes were on the same
processor, or they could be exchanged via the Internet if the
processes were physically separated or on a serial line in a dial
up situation. While the performance of the collective of processes
would obviously be affected by the message transmission speed, the
predictability and reproducibility of that performance would not
be.</p><p>The importance of predictability of software cannot be
overstated when it comes to software testing. Nothing makes
software QA people wish for a career change more than an
application which exhibits unpredictable and unreproducible
behavior.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e6580.0x19dece8"></a>SIMPL Open-Source Project</h2></div></div><p>To help promote this software IC paradigm in the Linux
community we started the SIMPL open-source project
(<a href="http://www.holoweb.net/~simpl" target="_self">www.holoweb.net/~simpl</a>).
SIMPL enabled processes are Linux processes with all the features
and protections that affords. SIMPL enabled processes are able to
exchange tokenized binary messages using a blocking
Send/Receive/Reply messaging scheme. In short SIMPL processes have
the makings of some great software ICs.
</p><p>Before going into more detail on how these software ICs might
be built, it is worth emphasizing the advantages of this
model.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>In principle, SIMPL processes can be written in any
language. While much of the code on the SIMPL web site is still
written in C, there is no reason why a C++ or JAVA SIMPL process
could not be created and talk transparently to another SIMPL
process written in Tcl/Tk or Python.</p></li><li><p>The language used to write the software IC itself
in no way dictates the language of another software IC with which
interaction takes place. Furthermore, a given SIMPL process has no
way of discovering what language was used to construct another IC
with which it is exchanging a message.</p></li><li><p>A SIMPL software IC has no way of discovering or
knowing the physical location of its exchange partner. This means
that the same binary image can be tested with local message
exchanges and then deployed with remote message exchanges. Overall
collective application performance would differ but the individual
software IC would not need to change in any way. In may instances
even a recompile is unnecessary.</p></li><li><p>A SIMPL software IC has no way of discovering the
internal algorithm of an exchange partner. This means that test
stubs can be created which completely simulate and replicate the
environment in which a given software IC finds itself. In
particular, error conditions which would be costly or difficult to
reproduce in the full system can readily be simulated in a test
environment. These SIMPL software ICs can be rigorously tested
before being deployed in the real-world application.</p></li><li><p>SIMPL software ICs lend themselves well to projects
with multiple developers. The implementation details of a SIMPL
enabled process cannot affect any interacting process, provided
that implementation conforms to the agreed upon message API. While
a poor IC implementation will certainly adversely affect the
overall application performance, the application will still
operate. Once a poor algorithm has been identified it can be worked
on in isolation from the real application and substituted once
tested without even recompiling the adjacent ICs.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e6580.0x19df268"></a>Basic Building Blocks</h2></div></div><p>The most basic SIMPL processes types are:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>senders&mdash;those processes that compose messages and
wait for replies</p></li><li><p>receivers&mdash;those processes that wait for messages
and compose replies</p></li></ul></div>

composites or special types of these two basic building elements.
The SIMPL project is governed by the LGPL or similar open licenses.
All of the source code for the software IC discussed below is
available on the SIMPL web site.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e6580.0x19df688"></a>Various Software ICs</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Simulator</b></span> One of the great
advantages of the SIMPL paradigm is that it allows for the ready
development of testing stubs. We have adopted the following naming
convention with respect to these testing stub processes.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>the stub for a receiver process is called a
&ldquo;simulator&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>the stub for a sender process is called a
&ldquo;stimulator&rdquo; A typical simulator setup might look as
follows:</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4189f2.large.jpg"><img src="4189f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Simulator
</p></div></div><p>The item being tested here is the sender. The key to
understanding simulators is understanding the fact that, provided
the simulator conforms to the SIMPL naming convention expected at
the sender and conforms to all the expected message formats that
the sender can exchange, the sender will not be able to detect that
it is talking to a test stub. As such, the sender process can be
vigorously tested in a very realistic test &ldquo;sandbox&rdquo; without
having to alter the deployed executable in any fashion. There is no
need for conditional compiles, test flags, etc., that are typical
of unit test scenarios in non-SIMPL designs. Once tested, the
sender executable can be deployed as is in the final
application.</p><p>The exact composition of the simulator code is highly
dependent on the application. The diagram above illustrates a
typical scenario whereby one desires to have the ability to
interact with the simulator directly via keyboard commands. In
addition the canned responses are being fed in from a data
file.</p><p>One can imagine more sophisticated simulators where the whole
test sequence is metered in from the data file in a highly
controllable manner.</p><p>Stimulator</p><p>When the object needing unit testing is a receiver process,
one would typically use a stimulator to replace the real senders in
the test phase.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4189f3.large.jpg"><img src="4189f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Stimulator
</p></div></div><p>The item being tested here is the receiver. As was the case
with the simulators above, the key here is that, provided the
stimulator conforms to all messaging and naming conventions, the
receiver process will have no way of knowing that it is being sent
a message from a stimulator or from the real sender in the final
application.</p><p>As was the case with the sender process in the simulator
example, the receiver under test here can be the final deployable
executable in all respects. Once again no conditional compilation
or other executable altering techniques are required in the SIMPL
paradigm.</p><p>As with the simulator, the typical stimulator contains a
keyboard interface for the tester to interact with. More
sophisticated stimulators may feed the test input from a data
file.</p><p>The importance of being able to test deployable executables
in a SIMPL application cannot be emphasized enough. In our
experience this is one of the most important reasons for
considering the SIMPL paradigm in designing software
applications.</p><p>Relay</p><p>In a SIMPL system all processes are named. In the simplest of
systems the names are normally assigned to processes (and passed to
other processes) as part of the startup information on the command
line. Occasionally it is desirable to simplify the amount of name
information that needs to be passed into the code. The construct
called a relay is useful for this type of thing.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4189f4.large.jpg"><img src="4189f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Relay
</p></div></div><p>The basic relay operation is quite easy to grasp. The sender
thinks that the relay process is the intended receiver for its
messages. It does all the normal name locate and send operations as
if it were part of a simple sender/receiver pair. The relay process
on the other hand does nothing at all with the message. It simply
remembers the ID of the sender and then forwards that ID on to the
registered receiver process. When the receiver gets the relayed
message it connects to the shared memory block of the sender
process and retrieves the message in the normal manner. Once the
message is processed the receiver places the reply in the sender's
reply area and replies the sender ID back to the relay process. The
relay process then simply replies back to the sender in the normal
manner. Note that because of the SIMPL architecture, the relay
process never needs to copy the message during these
activities.</p><p>The advantages of this construct over a basic sender/receiver
pairing lie in the name hiding that can occur with the receiver. It
is also possible to start and stop receivers dynamically in this
scheme without having to recommunicate naming information to the
various senders in the system. If that occurs the startup message
exchange, called registration in the diagram above, takes care of
notifying the relay task of the new receiver's name
information.</p><p>The ability to start and stop processes dynamically without
cycling the whole application can be a significant advantage,
particularly if the receiver logic is undergoing frequent upgrades
or enhancements. These can be rolled in dynamically, and if
problems occur the original copy can quickly be rolled back into
play. In fact, with the registration scheme, both receiver
processes could be running and a quick message exchange will have
the effect of &ldquo;routing&rdquo; messages to the new receiver (or back
again). With the registration scheme, the receiver in question can
override an existing registration. While some may view this type of
thing as a potential security hole it is only open to someone with
privileges for running a new process on the system. It is
relatively easy to build a certificate-type check on top of the
registration process to close this hole considerably if that is an
issue.</p><p>Obviously the relay will incur a performance penalty over the
straight message exchange, but in many circumstances the advantages
which come with the construct outweigh the disadvantages. The relay
is a powerful SIMPL construct.</p><p>Agency</p><p>In addition to the name-hiding capabilities of the relay
construct, it is sometimes desirable to exert greater control on
the messages and their sequencing. The agency is a useful construct
for these types of applications.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4189f5.large.jpg"><img src="4189f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Agency
</p></div></div><p>To understand the agency, one needs to understand the concept
of reply blocking. In a normal SIMPL message exchange the receiver
is receive blocked. Once the sender sends a message it is then said
to be reply blocked. The key to the agency construct is that the
receiver does not need to reply right away to that particular
sender. It can simply remember the ID and go on about its business.
In fact the receiver can &ldquo;hold&rdquo; the sender waiting and go back to
being receive blocked for a new message. When new information
arrives via a message from a second sender the receiver could
choose to reply to the original sender with that information using
its previously remembered ID. Another way to look at a reply
blocked sender is as a &ldquo;receiver&rdquo; that doesn't block its
&ldquo;sender&rdquo;.</p><p>To avoid some confusion of semantics, we have adopted the
naming convention for the agency processes as per the diagram
above. The requestor is simply another name for the normal sender.
As far as this process is concerned the intended receiver for the
message is the agency itself. The agency process however is
completely neutral to the actual message content. It is simply
going to act as &ldquo;store and forward&rdquo; for the requestor(s)
messages. It is important to note that with the basic SIMPL package
all &ldquo;sender&rdquo; type processes place their message in a block of
shared memory which they own and control. The actual message does
not need to be copied out of the sender's buffer by the receiver
but can be read directly by linking to the shared memory area. The
agency construct takes advantage of this fact. When the requestor
sends a message to the agency, the agency does not copy the message
anywhere. It simply notes the ID of the requestor and does one of
two things:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Queues the requestor ID</p></li><li><p>Forwards the requestor ID on to the agent
process</p></li></ul></div><p>The agent in this scheme contains all the normal &ldquo;receiver&rdquo;
logic for this application. It is, however, working as a reply
blocked sender. In its simplest form the agent talks to the agency
in three different message formats:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >WHAT_YA_GOT</b> request for any
queued messages</p></li><li><p>To which the agency will reply
<b  >GOT_ONE</b> requestor messages for it to
process</p></li><li><p>To which the agent will respond by sending
<b  >AGENT_REPLY</b> messages which contain the processed
reply destined for the requestor</p></li></ul></div>

It all looks quite complex, but in fact it is quite SIMPL. Imagine
the following scenario. The agency and agent are up and running.
The agent locates the agency and then says WHAT_YA_GOT. At this
point, because the requestor has not sent in any message the agency
simply notes the agent's ID and leaves him reply blocked. At this
point suppose the requestor generates a message and fires it off to
the agency. The agency receives the message and notes that the
agent is ready to process it. It simply relays the requestor's ID
on to the agent via a SIMPL reply and leaves the requestor reply
blocked. The agent then is free to chew away on the requestor's
message while the requestor is reply blocked in the normal manner.
Ultimately the agent will come up with a &ldquo;response&rdquo; to the
requestor's message. It wraps this response in its AGENT_REPLY
message and fires it down to the agency. Part of this wrapper
message contains the ID for the requestor process. The agency then
unwraps the message and replies it back to the requestor and leaves
the agent reply blocked waiting for the next request.
</p><p>To the requestor it all went exactly as if it had been
sending any SIMPL message to a basic receiver. In fact there is no
difference in the requestor code for dealing with agencies. Why
then go to all this trouble?</p><p>First of all, it is now possible to dynamically start and
stop the agent process in this system without affecting the
requestor (other than delaying responses to a request that arrived
while the agent was being cycled). In systems where the agent might
be undergoing significant revisions or upgrades, this might be a
distinct advantage.</p><p>Secondly, the requestor in this system does not need to know
the name of the agent in order to exchange a message with it. The
agency construct can be viewed as a message gateway.</p><p>To understand the further advantages we need to examine the
case where we may have multiple requestors all talking to the same
agency and agent. In this scenario the agency will actually receive
all the requestor's messages and will queue their originator's
ID's. The agency logic can then be in control of the order in which
these messages are dispatched to the agent. In a normal
sender/receiver pairing the FIFO imposes a first-in, first-out
ordering and it is not possible to have a higher priority message
jump ahead in the queue. In the agency scheme this is very
possible.</p><p>In addition, in the normal SIMPL sender/receiver pairing the
messaging is synchronous. It is intentionally difficult to kick a
sender out of a reply blocked state by any other means than by
having the receiver do a reply. This means things like timeouts or
&ldquo;aged data&rdquo; are difficult to handle. The agency scheme makes
these things relatively easy to manage. While messages are pending
in the agency queue, the agency can be kicked into examining these
periodically for timeouts or aging.</p><p>The agency construct will suffer a performance penalty when
compared with a basic sender/receiver pair because at least two
extra messages need to be exchanged in each transaction. The agency
construct, however, is a powerful one and can be used to great
advantage in certain designs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e6580.0x1cebc58"></a>Courier</h2></div></div><p>Occasionally it is necessary in a design for two receiver
processes to exchange messages. The courier construct illustrated
below is a good way to accommodate this requirement.
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4189f6.large.jpg"><img src="4189f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Courier
</p></div></div>

</p><p>A typical example would involve a user-interface process.
Typically user interfaces, be they simple text-based interaction or
GUIs, want to be receiver-type processes. It is not often that you
would want the user interface to block on a send. Very often in
these designs the user interface (UI) requires information from
another receiver process. If you went ahead and coded a blocking
send into the UI then you could potentially have a place in the
operation of the UI where the interface would freeze while the
request was being serviced. This may not be the desired
behavior.</p><p>The courier construct takes advantage of the delayed reply
concept illustrated in the agency construct above. In our
discussion we will assume that the UI process is &ldquo;receiver1&rdquo; and
the recipient process is &ldquo;receiver2&rdquo;. When the courier process is
started the first thing it does is locate the UI process it is
designated to service. Once located, the courier will send a
registration-type message to that process indicating that it is
ready for action. The UI process will simply note that the courier
is available and not reply, thereby leaving the courier reply
blocked. At the point in the UI where the asynchronous request to
the receiver2 process needs to be accomplished, a message is
composed and sent (replied) via the courier. The courier is now
unblocked and proceeds to locate and forward the message to the
receiver2 process using a blocking send. At this point the courier
is reply blocked on receiver2 and the UI is completely free to do
other things as permitted by its logic. When receiver2 replies to
the courier, the courier simply forwards that reply on to the UI
process using a blocking send and once again becomes reply blocked
on the UI. The UI receives this message in the normal manner, notes
that it came via the courier, marks that the courier is once again
available and processes the message in accordance with the logic
coded.</p><p>This simple courier described above is a single request
version. If a second UI request intended for the receiver2 process
is generated within the UI before the courier returns its first
response that request will be refused, siting the &ldquo;busy courier&rdquo;.
A simple enhancement to this single request logic is to have a
single-message-queuing capability in the UI. The &ldquo;busy courier&rdquo;
response then would only come if a third UI request is attempted
before the original response is received. In most UI processes this
single message queue is more than adequate. A larger queue depth
algorithm could be constructed readily, but the need for this is
often indicative of a poor UI design elsewhere.</p><p>Another variation on the courier model is to have a parent
process fork the couriers on demand. In some cases this capability
is more desirable than having the courier prestarted along with the
GUI process. The web applet type GUI applications are examples
where this courier spawning technique is desirable.</p><p>Especially in user-interface designs, the courier construct
is a very useful SIMPL building block indeed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e6580.0x1cec0d0"></a>Broadcaster</h2></div></div><p>There are times in a design where there is a need for a
one-to-many sender/receiver relationship. For simple cases, one can
simply have the sender locate all the intended recipients and loop
through sending to each. In more sophisticated designs the
broadcaster construct illustrated below is very powerful.
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4189f7.large.jpg"><img src="4189f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 7. Broadcaster</p></div></div>
</p><p>The broadcaster actually consists of two parts: a receiver
and a sender. We call the sender part the broadcaster. The receiver
is typically a message queue as we shall see shortly. It works in
the following manner: and the queue looks after message queuing and
sequencing. The broadcaster maintains a list of processes to send
to.</p><p>A typical sequence may start with a receiver (say receiver1)
deciding that it wishes to receive broadcast messages. As part of
that sequence it sends a registration-type message to the
broadcaster's queue process. The queue will then place a
REGISTRATION-type message onto its internal queue. Meanwhile the
broadcaster returns from one of its broadcast sequences by sending
a message down to the queue process asking whether there are any
new messages queued. In this example the REGISTRATION message for
receiver1 is delivered as a reply to the broadcaster. When the
broadcaster process detects that the message is a new REGISTRATION,
it does a nameLocate on that the recipient (receiver1 in this
example) and stores the ID in its internal broadcast list. It sends
a confirmation message back to the queue process, which then
proceeds to reply and unblock the original receiver (receiver1&mdash;who
was temporarily a sender). If there were no more messages on the
internal queue, the broadcaster would simply be left reply blocked
at this stage. At this point the sender may send a message to the
broadcaster's queue process that is intended for broadcast.
Typically the queue would queue the message and reply immediately
to the sender, but one could do a blocking send scheme similar to
that of the registration process. If the queue detects that the
broadcaster is reply blocked it immediately forwards the message
via a reply to the broadcaster. Once the broadcaster gets the
message it notes that this is not a registration and therefore is a
message to be sent to all the registered recipients in its
broadcast list. Once this series of sends is complete the
broadcaster will send back to the queue for the next message and
the process repeats.</p><p>When a recipient wishes to cancel its registration with the
broadcaster, it simply repeats the registration process with a
DEREGISTER message to the queue. It is typical that the queue would
simply queue and acknowledge this request.</p><p>If a recipient &ldquo;forgets&rdquo; to deregister and simply vanishes,
the next broadcast attempt will detect that condition and the
broadcaster would proceed to remove that ID from its internal
broadcast list.</p><p>The broadcaster construct is a very powerful SIMPL tool. A
typical example of its use would be to synchronize multiple
instances of a GUI applet with the same information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e6580.0x1cec5a0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The SIMPL paradigm adds some important tools to the Linux
developer's toolset. With its process centric model of
encapsulation, coupled with a blocking Send/Receive/Reply
messaging, the SIMPL libraries make an excellent platform on which
to develop software ICs. We believe that the advantages of this
software development paradigm are significant and cost effective.
</p><p>All of the source code for these Software ICs is available on
the SIMPL web site. While this source code delivery method for
these ICs is effective as a means to &ldquo;seed the thinking&rdquo; it does
not mean that SIMPL ICs must be delivered in source code format.
There is nothing in the LGPL license that the SIMPL project uses
that prevents software ICs from being deliverable in binary
format.</p><p>This opens up an exciting era is software design. Software
designers may finally be on par with their hardware cousins when it
comes to managing project complexity.</p><p><a href="4189s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
