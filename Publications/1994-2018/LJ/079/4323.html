    Enough about us already; what do you think?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x1282450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Roll out the red carpet, it's time to
announce the winners of the 2000 <i  >Linux Journal</i>
Readers' Choice Awards. After another explosive year, the hype and
trendiness have cleared to reveal (as we knew it would) that Linux
is a serious contender in almost every market. Although some
speculate that the development of all things Linux has settled
down, we know the revolution is gaining breadth and speed. While we
all look forward to the new applications, devices and services on
the horizon, these awards are an opportunity to appreciate what we
already have. Judging by this year's list of choices (the longest
ever), not to mention all those write-ins, we have a lot. To get an
idea of what voters said, I've included some quotes for each
category.
</p><p>Over 4,000 readers voted in 24 categories on everything from
favorite programming language to favorite game. What overall moral
can we discern from this year's responses? The percentage of voters
with fervent opinions is directly proportional to those with
caffeine addictions. Coincidence...I don't think so.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x1282608"></a>Favorite Distribution: Red Hat Linux</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;I love them all.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Red Hat Linux regains the top spot, the first time since
1997, with over twice the votes of the second-place distribution,
SuSE. Mandrake doubles its percentage from last year to just over
14%, placing it third. Last year's winner, Debian GNU/Linux, falls
to fourth place. Slackware has a respectable showing with 8.5% of
the total vote. The most popular write-ins are FreeBSD and &ldquo;roll
my own&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x12827c0"></a>Favorite Office Suite: StarOffice</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;StarOffice but quickly becoming
KOffice.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>With over 63% of the votes, StarOffice is the clear winner;
WordPerfect comes in second with only 12%. The office suite is a
sore spot for many Linux users, as shown by the write-in comments.
Quite a few voters apologize before picking Microsoft Office as
their favorite, and almost as many decry, &ldquo;None, they all suck.&rdquo;
Emacs, vi and clones, and GNOME Office Suite all make write-in
appearances.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x1282978"></a>Favorite Desktop Environment: KDE</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4323f2.jpg"></div>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Command line.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>While some proclaimed KDE dead with the announcement of the
GNOME Foundation this past August, <i  >LJ</i> readers
chose KDE as their favorite desktop environment for the third year
in a row. With 400 fewer votes, GNOME takes second place. Window
Maker and Enlightenment are only 40 votes apart, but neither
received more than 9.7%.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x1282ce8"></a>Favorite Word Processor: StarOffice</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;WP8, only not that Windows junk.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>StarOffice claims a resounding victory in the word processor
voting, racking up almost twice as many votes as its nearest
competitor, WordPerfect. After those two, however, the results
split into many processors with a few votes each, suggesting that
this is one of the more personal categories, where everyone has an
old favorite.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x1282ea0"></a>Favorite Text Editor: vi and clones</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Elvis&mdash;so good it deserves its own
category!&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>If people are loyal to their old favorites in any category,
it's got to be this one. <span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> and
clones, a broad list, is once again your favorite text editor, with
almost 40% of the total votes. Emacs are popular in all their
forms, Gnu Emacs, X Emacs and the LaTeX+Emacs combo. Some write-ins
express a desire to see some vi clones, like Elvis and VIM, given
their own, separate listings. Maybe next year.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x12830b0"></a>Most Indispensable Linux Book: Running
Linux</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4323f3.jpg"></div>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;What are these book things you refer
to?&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;The whole O'Reilly series&mdash;life without them
would be a disaster!&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span>, by Matt Welsh, takes
first place and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux in a Nutshell</em></span>, by Ellen
Siever et al, takes second, in a reversal of last year's top two
books. The margin was close though, with only 34 votes separating
them. Looking at the complete list of vote-getters, the most
extensive list for any category, many books appear indispensable to
<i  >LJ</i> readers. But not everyone is an avid Linux
book reader; numerous write-ins show up for man pages and on-line
documentation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x1283580"></a>Favorite Web Browser: Netscape/Mozilla</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4323f4.jpg"></div>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Zen&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;It's more of a necessity kind of
thing.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Judging by the write-ins, this category resembles another
ballot choice U.S. voters face in November: the lesser of two
evils. Netscape/Mozilla wins by a mile (over 80%), with the next
closest browser, Lynx, receiving 201 votes. Konqueror racks up 77
write-ins, just cracking the top five. The rest of the write-ins
are almost evenly split between messages like &ldquo;Mozilla&mdash;NOT
Netscape&rdquo;, &ldquo;I hate'm all&rdquo; and &ldquo;Internet Explorer&mdash;Sorry!&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x1283948"></a>Favorite <i  >Linux Journal</i> Column: Kernel
Korner</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;The nice thing is that with every issue another
column stands out.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;I must say, without being too forward, I enjoy
everything you all do.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Aw shucks...you're making us blush with all this praise. Now,
we know you're not always happy with every issue (a certain cover
shot seemed particularly upsetting to some), but you seem satisfied
overall. Kernel Korner receives the most votes, making it the
favorite <i  >LJ</i> column four years in a row. Second
and third place go to At the Forge and Best of Technical Support,
respectively.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x1283c60"></a>Favorite Distributed File-Sharing System:
Gnapster</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>The Napster lawsuit gave rise to wide-spread controversy; it
seemed like everyone had an opinion about it this summer. (You know
something's up when Courtney Love sounds almost rational.) In our
on-line vote, Gnapster proves to be the most popular file-sharing
system with 45% of the votes. Gnutella comes in second with 34%.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x127a6a8"></a>Favorite Programming Beverage: Coffee</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Sadly enough, canned capitalism
(Coke).&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Sprite mixed with Fun Dip (cherry
flavor).&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Mountain Dew! Not just another soft
drink.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Perhaps some of the cranky write-in comments can be traced
back to the results of this category. Stereotype be damned, we like
our caffeine and if it's got sugar, even better. Coffee is the
beverage of choice with almost 50% of the votes. Other soft drinks
come in at a collective number two, although many write-ins do not
like to see their beloved Mountain Dew collapsed into this larger
category. Water makes a surprising appearance in the number three
spot.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x127a9c0"></a>Favorite Linux Game: Quake 3</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4323f5.jpg"></div>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>&ldquo;No time for games.&rdquo;</em></span> (But
plenty for questionnaires?)</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Install the operating system.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>In 1998, it was Quake and in 1999, Quake 2; this year, of
course, the winner is Quake 3. X-Bill pulls 9% of the votes and
Civilization: Call to Power takes 6%, to place second and third,
respectively. Rounding out the top five are the free games NetHack
and FreeCiv. We received many write-ins, suggesting, happily, that
Linux gamers have more reasons than ever not to leave the house.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x127ade0"></a>Favorite Linux Web Site: Slashdot.org</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4323f6.jpg"></div>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;eLinux.com. Talk about getting all the
buzzwords in your domain name.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Are you kidding? All of them!&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>While not exclusively about Linux, Slashdot is where we all
go, judging by the vote tally. Slashdot easily claims victory for
the third year in a row, receiving twice the number of votes as the
second-place site, Freshmeat.net. Other popular sites include
LinuxToday.com, the Linux Documentation Project and Linux.org.
Favorite web site is another category with an extensive write-in
list, of which the most mentioned is linuxfr.org. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tu
parles fran&ccedil;ais, non</em></span>?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x127b200"></a>Favorite Instant Messaging Client: Xchat</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;What else but Gnomeicu?&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>A new category to the Readers' Choice Awards, just under half
of all voters picked a favorite IM client. Xchat garners the most
votes, picking up 20% of the total. Chomping on Xchat's heels,
however, is Jabber; a mere 15 votes separate them. BitchX comes in
third with 14. As for write-ins, gnomeicu is the most popular. Will
everybody have a favorite next year?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x127b3b8"></a>Favorite Programming Language: C/C++</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Plain C (without the ++).&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>The perennial C/C++ wins 40% of your votes this year. To
everyone who took the time to remind us that C and C++ are not the
same language, we hear you loud and clear. Second and third place
go to Perl and Java, while Python continues to expand its fan base
by claiming 8%.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x127b570"></a>Favorite Platform: Intel x86</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Amiga :) Running RH 5 and NetBSD 4.x.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Platforms that are really tall.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>While some of you claim to use it under protest, Intel x86 is
the clear winner with 60% of your votes. The clone AMD, a popular
write-in last year, made it to the official ballot this year and
received just under 20%. Rounding out the top picks are PowerPC and
Alpha. As a write-in, Transmeta makes its debut in the platform
category&mdash;a preview of next year, perhaps?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x127b7d8"></a>Favorite Shell: Bash</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Turtle Shell.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Pathetic, Hollow Shell (of a Man).&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Bash won? It wasn't even close? You don't say. For the third
year, the Bourne Again Shell demonstrates its hold over voters (and
users), claiming 78% of your responses. In the distance are tcsh
with 10% and ksh with 4.5%. A few write-ins express the preference
to use bash for scripting while using another shell for everyday
use. As for all the shell pun write-ins, who says geeks can't make
a (bad) joke?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x127ba40"></a>Favorite Development Tool: Gnu Compiler
Collection (GCC)</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;VIM rules forever!&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Development tool is one of several categories this year where
the distance between first and second place is more than
substantial. GCC, at 71%, received almost ten times the number of
votes as the second-place tool, Code Warrior. And really, where
would any of us be without GCC? An up-and-comer, KDevelop, grabbed
third place through the power of write-ins. We'll add it the list
next year, guys.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x127bbf8"></a>Favorite Audio Tool: XMMS</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;My plain old radio.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;One that works would be nice!&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Things sure can change in a year. In the 1999 Awards, XMMS
appeared a few times as a write-in; this year, it's the clear and
away winner. Receiving just under 50% of your votes, it wins by a
healthy margin, too. In the closest finish of any category, second
and third place were determined by a single vote&mdash;Real Audio and
mpg123, respectively. And some of you are still gladly using your
CD players.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x127be60"></a>Favorite Graphics Tool: GIMP</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4323f7.jpg"></div>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;My girlfriend says GIMP because she uses it
(and is looking over my shoulder).&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Photoshop...sob sob. Why won't they port this
thing?!&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>So this new graphics tool came out of nowhere...maybe next
year. For now, the GIMP has a strong-hold on this category; this
year it wins with 72% of the total votes. The next closest favorite
tools are xv with 10% and CorelDRAW with 7%. Voters are pleased by
the GIMP's versatility and its ease-of-use, especially for the less
artistically gifted among us.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x127c228"></a>Favorite Database: MySQL</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4323f8.jpg"></div>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;The one that I don't need to admin.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;FBI Database on Un-American
Activities.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Some database users engage in a war of words when it comes to
MySQL vs. PostgreSQL. Our readers, at least the ones that voted,
prefer MySQL by a 2 to 1 ratio. Oracle 8i R2 comes in third with
almost 11%, making our top-three line-up a repeat of 1999's. None
of the other databases received more than 3% of the tally.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x127c5f0"></a>Favorite Ad Filtering Tool: Junkbuster</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4323f9.jpg"></div>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;I don't use any (yet). Thanks for the
tip.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Judging by the low turnout for this new category, it seems
like most of you use the old standard, manual filtering method:
closing your eyes. Those of you who did express a preference choose
Junkbuster as your favorite, beating SquidGuard by 40%. The most
popular write-in filtering tool is AdZapper. Quite a few indies
take the DIY approach and write their own proxies.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x158fea8"></a>Favorite Communications Board: Cyclades</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4323f10.jpg"></div>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Federal Communications Board (or is that
Commission?).&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Um...that's not quite what we meant. To be fair, though, some
of you wrote that you didn't know what we meant by this category,
which could explain why less than half of all voters picked a
favorite board. Among those who figured us out, Cyclades is the
number-one choice, with 50% of your votes. Digi International comes
in second and Boca rounds out the top three.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x15901c0"></a>Favorite Backup Utility:
<span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span></h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Backups?!? Vee don't need no stinking
backups!&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Okay, okay. While &ldquo;real men don't need backups,&rdquo; some of
our more cautious readers like
<span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span>. This easy solution was quite
vocal in 1999's write-in votes, so we added it to the official list
this year&mdash;and it won. <span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span>
displaces last year's winner, BRU, by 46%, but BRU still comes in
second. Arkeia and Amanda competed for third place, but Arkeia
claims it with 11 more votes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118a580.0x1590480"></a>Favorite X-Server: XFree86</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Only use XFree86...maybe others are good;
dunno.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Do any of you guys use anything but XFree86? Apparently not.
93% of respondents choose XFree86 as their favorite X-Server.
Accelerated X, in second place, acquires votes totaling 3.5%. The
most popular write-in&mdash;it only took six votes to get there&mdash;is
Xpmac.
