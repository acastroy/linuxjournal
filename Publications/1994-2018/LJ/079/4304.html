    If you haven't already, perhaps it's time to see if
    PostgreSQL is the database for you.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbba580.0xcb25b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>When I first began to use Linux for basic
Web development, I saw that my three primary tools&mdash;Perl, GNU Emacs
and Apache&mdash;were already included. But, at least one thing was
missing, namely a relational database. I had used databases (mostly
Sybase) for about a year when I began working with Linux, and knew
that I would need a good database server in order to create
sophisticated web sites.
</p><p>I had heard of PostgreSQL and, after learning a bit more
about it, decided to install it. Unfortunately, my installation
experience was less than pleasant, and I gave up after several
hours. Another reason I gave up was that I found another database
server, MySQL. MySQL did not have all of the features I wanted in a
database, but it was close enough; I implemented many web
applications for clients using it.</p><p>Things have changed quite a bit in the last five years: MySQL
has been rereleased under the GNU General Public License and is
slated to include basic support for transactions, while PostgreSQL
is now remarkably easy to install and includes a wealth of features
and functionality. Both are well known in the Free Software
community as powerful programs that can help get your work
done.</p><p>I still use MySQL for a variety of tasks and expect to
continue doing so, but, increasingly, I find that PostgreSQL is a
better fit for my needs. This month, we will look at PostgreSQL,
starting with its basic features, to create a small web-based
application that uses transactions. Along the way, I will try to
compare it with MySQL, describing where one product might be better
suited than the other.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbba580.0xcb27c0"></a>Installing PostgreSQL</h2></div></div><p>As of this writing, the latest version of PostgreSQL is
7.0.2, released in the spring of 2000. As with all open-source
software, you can download the PostgreSQL source code from the
Internet and compile it yourself. My office uses the Red Hat
distribution, and I generally prefer to install software with RPMs
for easier maintenance. We downloaded the RPMs from the PostgreSQL
web site, installed them, and were up and running in almost no
time.</p><p>Like all modern database systems, PostgreSQL contains a
server that can handle connections from multiple clients.
Typically, only one computer in a network is designated to be the
database server, with the remaining computers configured as
clients. (The server is often configured to be a client as well, in
order to facilitate debugging and system configuration.) RPMs for
the server typically begin with the name &ldquo;postgresql-server&rdquo;,
while the client RPMs are named &ldquo;postgresql&rdquo; followed by the
version number.</p><p>PostgreSQL clients exist&mdash;in source form and as RPMs&mdash;for
most of the programming languages that people use in designing web
applications, including Perl, Python, Java and PHP. If you intend
to build any of these from scratch, you will need to install the
PostgreSQL development libraries, either from source code or from
the RPMs. I compiled Perl and its modules from the source code but,
otherwise, took advantage of the RPMs and installed the precompiled
binaries.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbba580.0xcb2978"></a>Using PostgreSQL</h2></div></div><p>Like MySQL and many other relational databases, tables within
PostgreSQL are grouped into a single &ldquo;database&rdquo;, much as files
are grouped within a directory. PostgreSQL offers a great deal of
flexibility when it comes to security configurations. Databases can
allow or deny access based on IP address or user name, while
individual tables and other objects allow various levels of access
based on the user name. These configurations are performed in the
pg_hba.conf file, which was installed by default in
/var/lib/pgsql/data on my system.</p><p>By default, only one user, called &ldquo;postgres&rdquo;, is authorized
to create new users or to create new databases. When you first
start to use PostgreSQL, you will probably have to use
<span   class="bold"><b>su</b></span> to change your identity to
root, then su again to change your identity to &ldquo;postgres&rdquo;. Once
you have become the postgres user, you can use the
<span   class="bold"><b>createuser</b></span> program to create one
or more new users. You can then indicate whether they are allowed
to create new databases and/or new users.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>psql</b></span> database client
which comes with PostgreSQL is an excellent interactive tool for
working with the database. Like the MySQL client program, it uses
GNU ReadLine to provide Emacs-compatible keybindings for entering
SQL queries directly. <span   class="bold"><b>psql</b></span> also
provides an extensive number of help commands that begin with
backslashes, such as <span   class="bold"><b>\h</b></span> (which
displays help for any SQL command),
<span   class="bold"><b>\d</b></span> (which lists available objects
and details about those objects), and
<span   class="bold"><b>\l</b></span> (which lists available
databases). I use psql constantly to double-check that
program-generated queries worked correctly; it is easy and quick to
use.</p><p>PostgreSQL implements a large portion of standard SQL and,
therefore, is easy to learn if you have previously worked with a
relational database. We can create a simple table, as shown in
Listing 1.</p><p><a href="4304l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>serial</b></span> data type is
similar to MySQL's AUTO_INCREMENT tag. It provides us with a unique
number each time we <span   class="bold"><b>insert</b></span> a new
row into the table. <span   class="bold"><b>serial</b></span> columns
use a PostgreSQL data type called a &ldquo;sequence&rdquo; on which the
PostgreSQL <span   class="bold"><b>nextval</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>currval</b></span> functions operate. It is
also possible to use a sequence directly (see Listing 2).</p><p><a href="4304l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>PostgreSQL distinguishes between single and double quotes, so
be sure to say <b  >nextval(`people_id')</b> and not
<b  >nextval("people_id")</b>.</p><p>Inside of psql, the semicolon is a synonym for
<span   class="bold"><b>\g</b></span>, meaning &ldquo;go and execute this
query&rdquo;. Outside of psql, it has no meaning and may even cause an
error in your database driver.</p><p>PostgreSQL, unlike MySQL, is case insensitive when it comes
to table and column names. However, I prefer to follow Joe Celko's
capitalization rules for SQL: keywords in ALL CAPS, table names in
LeadingCaps, and column names in
all_lowercase_with_underscores.</p><p>As in MySQL, PostgreSQL allows us to designate which column
is the primary key. PostgreSQL also allows for
<span   class="bold"><b>unique</b></span> columns (and combinations
of columns), as well as the creation of indices with the
<span   class="bold"><b>create index</b></span> statement.</p><p>PostgreSQL's data types are slightly different from those in
MySQL, but relatively easy to understand if you have worked with
another database. <span   class="bold"><b>varchar</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>numeric</b></span> types are supported.
Perhaps the most confusing difference between data types in MySQL
and PostgreSQL is <span   class="bold"><b>timestamp</b></span>. Under
MySQL, a timestamp column is automatically set to the value of the
latest <span   class="bold"><b>insert</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>update</b></span>. In PostgreSQL, a timestamp
column simply contains a date/time value.</p><p>PostgreSQL supports many standard SQL functions and many of
the extensions that MySQL contains. The difference, of course, is
in how they are implemented. For example, MySQL has a
<span   class="bold"><b>regexp</b></span> function similar
<span   class="bold"><b>like</b></span> function. PostgreSQL, by
contrast, has implemented regexp functionality with the
<b  >~</b> (tilde) operator, perhaps because of Perl's
popularity.</p><p>PostgreSQL also makes it possible to create new datatypes
with the <span   class="bold"><b>create type</b></span> function.
Indeed, one of PostgreSQL's claims to fame is that it is a hybrid
of object-oriented and relational databases. I have never needed to
use this functional, but it does seem to be an intriguing and
powerful feature.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbba580.0xcb3898"></a>Referential Integrity</h2></div></div><p>So far, PostgreSQL does not seem to be very different from
MySQL, except in some of its basic syntax. But, it is here that the
two databases begin to diverge. PostgreSQL includes what are known
as &ldquo;referential integrity&rdquo; checks, meaning that I can define
certain values in a row cand be defined as illegal.</p><p>One of the first things that a database programmer learns is
that <span   class="bold"><b>null</b></span> indicates that a column
contains no value&mdash;not even false, the empty string or zero. We can
forbid a column to contain &ldquo;null&rdquo; by declaring the column to be
&ldquo;not null&rdquo;. This is perhaps the simplest integrity check, with
the database ensuring that the column in question can never contain
an illegal value. In our People table above, the name column is
defined as not null, telling the database that every person must
have a name.</p><p>Many times, however, this is not enough. For example, the
People table includes an e-mail column. Modern e-mail addresses
must contain an @ sign in order to be valid. Using referential
integrity, we can ensure that any e-mail address added to the
database contain an @ sign. In order to do this, we use
PostgreSQL's Perl-like ~ operator, which matches a string with a
regular expression:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
email   VARCHAR(50)   NOT NULL   CHECK (contact_email ~ '@')
</pre><p>Without an @, an entered (or updated) value will be
considered illegal and generate an error code. Having the database
flag such an error might seem frustrating, but it is certainly
better than having a database with incorrect values. I often use
such checks to ensure that columns are not null and to forbid the
empty string or other illegal values. For example, it is possible
to define the People table with referential integrity checks (see
Listing 3).
</p><p><a href="4304l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p>If I try to insert a row which violates any of these checks,
PostgreSQL will refuse to do so (see Listing 4).</p><p><a href="4304l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a></p><p>So it seems that my value for address2 was invalid. Indeed, I
tried to enter an empty string here, which is not allowed. Rather,
I should have entered a null value (remember, null and the empty
string are distinct values). Sure enough, replacing the empty
string with null allows the query to succeed. But the database
refused to allow us to corrupt it with invalid information and did
not insert the new row.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbba580.0xcaa5f8"></a>Foreign Keys</h2></div></div><p>Referential integrity also means that one table can reliably
point to another with &ldquo;foreign keys&rdquo;. Most tables have a primary
key, meaning a column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies
each row. For example, the databases of the United States Social
Security Administration uniquely identify each American citizen
with a Social Security Number. This number means that you can
change your name, address, phone number, bank accounts and job, but
the same SSN will still refer to you. In the same way, a primary
key allows us to continue pointing to a particular row in a table
without having to depend on any of the values in that row.</p><p>For example, let's assume that we want to create an
Appointments table containing three columns (see Listing 5).</p><p><a href="4304l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a></p><p>The table in Listing 5 allows us to indicate when we are
meeting with each person, ensuring that the notes column is either
null or non-empty, and that only one appointment can take place at
a time. The person_id column is supposed to contain the person_id
from the People table. However, what stops me from entering a
person_id of five or 50? How can I be sure that the value is
valid?</p><p>The answer is that we can set person_id to be a &ldquo;foreign
key&rdquo; of People, meaning that People.person_id can only contain a
value that is contained in People.person_id. We can add this
constraint with the REFERENCES keyword (see Listing 6).</p><p><a href="4304l7.html" target="_self">Listing 6</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbba580.0xcaa968"></a>Transactions</h2></div></div><p>One of the chief complaints that PostgreSQL users level
against MySQL is the lack of transactions. If you have only used
MySQL in your development work, you may wonder why you need
transactions and how they fit into a database environment.</p><p>The basic idea behind transactions is that they group
multiple queries into a single logical query. If any of the queries
in the transaction should fail, the database is &ldquo;rolled back&rdquo; to
where things were before the transaction started.</p><p>Thanks to transactions, you can be sure that a transfer of
money from one account to another will not accidentally leave you
with too much or too little money, even if the power fails in the
middle of the transaction. Until the transaction is finally
&ldquo;committed&rdquo;, the database pretends that none of it has
happened.</p><p>The MySQL documentation (and authors and support people) has
its own philosophy of transactions, including commit and rollback,
which runs counter to the &ldquo;ACID&rdquo; test that is prevalent among
current relational databases. While I disagree with some of their
conclusions, there is no doubt that the lack of conventional
transactions in MySQL has made it a flexible and fast database, one
that is well suited to web sites that perform many selects and few
inserts and updates.</p><p>PostgreSQL follows the standard model fairly closely, making
it possible to perform transactions without locking tables (as in
the MySQL paradigm). To begin a transaction, use the
<span   class="bold"><b>being work</b></span> statement, and to end
one use either the <span   class="bold"><b>commit</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>rollback</b></span> statement. Users of
Perl's DBI or of Java's JDBC can instead use the commit and
rollback methods associated with the database connection object.
Both DBI and JDBC operate by default in AutoCommit mode, meaning
that each query is implicitly placed within its own transaction. To
put several queries inside of a single transaction, a program must
turn off AutoCommit mode, perform the transaction, perform a commit
or rollback, and then (usually) turn AutoCommit mode back on. For
example, let's assume that we have a separate Salaries table that
indicates every employee's salary (see Listing 7).</p><p><a href="4304l8.html" target="_self">Listing 7</a></p><p>Notice how the above table ensures that each employee can get
only one raise on a given day, by setting a unique restriction on
the combination of an employee and day.</p><p>We could presumably keep this information in the People
table. However, putting salary information in a separate table
makes it easier to hide the information from prying eyes. It also
means that we can pull up an employee's entire salary history with
a <b  >SELECT</b> statement, while keeping the tables
normalized and storing information about each person only
once.</p><p>Having two tables for a single employee raises some issues.
Most significantly, we want to be sure that any employee added to
the People table will also be added to the Salaries table (it would
be rather embarrassing to have an employee without any salary).
Adding a new employee should be one logical operation but will
require two insert statements&mdash;one into People and the other into
Salaries. What happens if the database dies in the middle of the
second statement?</p><p>Listing 8 contains a simple command line program (which could
easily be turned into a CGI program) that creates a new employee,
first adding a new row into the People table, and then adding a
corresponding row to the Salaries table. We retrieve the person_id
of the newly inserted employee using PostgreSQL's
<span   class="bold"><b>currval</b></span> function. We then use that
value to <b  >INSERT</b> a row into the Salaries
table.</p><p><a href="4304l9.html" target="_self">Listing 8</a></p><p>We ensure that the two operations occur within a single
transaction by turning AutoCommit mode off (setting it to 0). Once
this happens, we are responsible for performing a commit when we
are done. Without a call to <b  >$dbh-&gt;commit</b>,
PostgreSQL will assume that we want to roll back both of the insert
operations, pretending that they never happened. If the program
dies in the middle&mdash;which will happen if any of the SQL queries
fails, since we have activated RaiseError&mdash;none of the changes will
occur.</p><p>To trap the error and display a message to the user, we can
use the block version of Perl's
<span   class="bold"><b>eval</b></span> function, demonstrated in
Listing 9. This runs the code inside of the {}, exiting from it,
and setting the special variable <b  >$@</b> if anything
goes wrong. This technique of using eval to trap errors gives us a
basic form of exception handling and enables us to print out only
the errors we want. If we were to activate either the PrintError
attribute or the &ldquo;use diagnostics&rdquo; pragma, Perl would print out
more than just our simple message, confusing the user.</p><p><a href="4304l10.html" target="_self">Listing 9</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbba580.0xcab308"></a>Views, Procedures, Triggers, and Rules</h2></div></div><p>We have now defined three tables: People, Appointments and
Salaries. What happens if I want to create a table listing all
appointments scheduled with people, along with their salary
histories? (This would be useful to have before annual salary
meetings.) The table in Listing 11 will perform such a request,
listing appointments in chronological order.</p><p>Rather than having to create this query from scratch each
time, we can create it as a &ldquo;view&rdquo;. Views are dynamically
generated tables with names attached that can largely be treated as
read-only tables. We can create a view of appointments and salary
information, as shown in Listing 10.</p><p><a href="4304l11.html" target="_self">Listing 10</a></p><p>Notice how there is almost no difference between the generic
select statement and the select used to create a view. Indeed, the
only change that we made was in dropping the order by clause,
because PostgreSQL has not implemented this functionality as of
version 7.0.2. So, we can list all appointments in chronological
order (see Listing 11).</p><p><a href="4304l12.html" target="_self">Listing 11</a></p><p>Views have a number of advantages over simple select
statements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>They force more of the processing to take place on
the database server. Since database servers are typically high-end
machines, and because they have ready access to the data, they end
up doing more of the work. The client spends less time creating
dynamically generated SQL statements.</p></li><li><p>Views have their own permission structure. For
example, the personnel department at a company, but no one else,
should have access to salary information. With views, it is
possible to hide information and allow particular users or IP
addresses to access the base table, but keep the view open to the
general public.</p></li><li><p>Perhaps most importantly, views let us think at a
higher level of abstraction than basic tables. Views can perform a
variety of calculations and manipulations on the values from our
table, just as a simple select can. If you know that you will have
to multiply all of the values in a particular column by three, you
can create a new view which automatically performs the calculation.
You no longer need to perform the calculation in the select
statement, nor in the program that retrieves the values.</p></li></ul></div><p>Views cannot take variable arguments, meaning that you cannot
create a view that sometimes retrieves user names beginning with
&ldquo;A&rdquo; and sometimes retrieves those that begin with &ldquo;B&rdquo;. To
perform such an operation, you will need to create a procedure.
PostgreSQL supports a variety of programming languages in which
procedures can be written, including Pl/PGsql (which is similar to
Oracle's PL/SQL language), PL-perl (procedures written in Perl),
and Pl-tcl (procedures written in Tcl).
</p><p>Once you have created procedures, you can then create
&ldquo;triggers&rdquo;. A trigger is a procedure automatically executed when
something happens in the system. For example, you can use a trigger
to ensure that when a user is deleted from the People table, rows
in the Salaries and Appointments tables refer to that user are also
deleted. Without this, it is possible for a row in Salaries or
Appointments to refer to a person_id that no longer exists.
Triggers can be activated whenever someone performs an insert,
update, or delete on a table, and can operate either before or
after the action occurs.</p><p>Finally, views are normally read-only objects, since they are
simply aliases for select queries. However, PostgreSQL has a
sophisticated rule system that makes it possible to rewrite queries
that fit certain criteria. Using rules, you can intercept an
insert, update or delete that is targeted at a view, and rewrite it
as a series of operations on one or more tables. Thus, an insert
into ApptAndSalaryView could not be rewritten, since the user's
e-mail address (from People) does not appear. However, an update
would certainly make sense, and could be rerouted to modify the
People, Appointments or Salaries tables as necessary.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbba580.0xcab9e8"></a>Limitations</h2></div></div><p>While PostgreSQL is rapidly growing in popularity, it does
have problems. The PostgreSQL development team is well aware of
these problems and seems to be dealing with them quickly.</p><p>The most pressing issue is probably the 8KB limitation on
each tuple, or database row. This means that no row can contain
more than 8KB of data. This affects many parts of the database's
operation, from providing only moderate support for BLOBs (binary
large objects) to preventing developers from creating even
moderate-sized tables.</p><p>Other issues, such as the combination of views with unions,
bit me (and my clients) on a recent programming project. This,
combined with the lack of outer joins, has meant a number of
workarounds in some recent projects. It is possible to get around
most or all of these at the application level, but I am anxiously
awaiting the addition of these features.</p><p>Working with MySQL has spoiled me somewhat, since the number
of built-in functions is large and allows me to create database
applications without creating my own functions. PostgreSQL has
fewer built-in functions but, as we saw earlier, does allow me to
create any that I might like, in a variety of programming
languages. However, the installation and use of these languages is
poorly documented; while they might be very powerful, it takes a
while to get started with them.</p><p>Despite some benchmarks that were recently released by a
PostgreSQL consulting group, it's safe to say that PostgreSQL is
slower than MySQL. At the same time, I was pleasantly surprised to
discover that the speed difference was not as great as I expected.
Of course, this speed difference exists because PostgreSQL includes
transactions and referential integrity, both of which require more
processing and record keeping than MySQL's table-level
locks.</p><p>A final drawback to PostgreSQL is that not as many
web-hosting services offer it. This may be unimportant when working
with dedicated servers, but some of my clients have the budget to
only rent a virtual server. Database capabilities should be a
consideration when looking for a web server, but, in my experience,
developers often have less say in the tools used for a project than
they might like. Still, if you are interested in something closer
to a commercial database, including transactions and integrity
constraints, PostgreSQL is your best choice.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbba580.0xcabca8"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>While I continue to use MySQL, I am increasingly impressed by
PostgreSQL and have begun to use it for a number of consulting
projects. I have been impressed by its speed and versatility, as
well as its future direction. The improvements between version
6.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and 7.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> were
staggering, and I look forward to seeing more!</p><p>If you are implementing database applications&mdash;including
web/database applications&mdash;under Linux, I encourage you to take a
look at PostgreSQL. Even if you decide to stick with MySQL, it is
useful to understand how other databases work and why there is such
a fuss about transactions, stored procedures and integrity
constraints in the community of database programmers. And who
knows? Maybe you will also find that PostgreSQL is better-suited to
your applications than you think. One of the beautiful things about
free software is that you can choose the tools that are best for
your needs, and learning about PostgreSQL is a great step in that
direction.</p><p><a href="4304s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
