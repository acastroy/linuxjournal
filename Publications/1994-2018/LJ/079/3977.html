protect Linux systems from break-in, as well as to detect evidence
of attacks quickly. The book is intended to provide readers with
skills, knowledge and tools that will allow them to prepare their
systems for use in production environments. The methods discussed
are from the perspective of restricting use to authorized access
and making it as difficult as possible for crackers to gain
access.</p><p>The book covers all aspects of Linux security and has plenty
of practical tools and techniques for achieving it. The authors
discuss common hacks and penetrations of Linux systems and show
administrators how to protect themselves, set traps and trail
hackers, using publicly available, open-source security tools. The
tools are used to analyze, protect and monitor systems and
networks.</p><p>In order to provide an accurate representation of the book's
contents, the following is a summary of each of the 18 chapters in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux System Security</em></span>.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Chapter 1--The authors guide the reader through a
system vulnerability survey and discuss security policies. Various
types of vulnerabilities and attacks are outlined, which is handy
for people with no previous exposure to these issues.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 2--A good overview of how to prepare a
Security Policy and a useful framework for its
implementation.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 3--Background information on BIOS
passwords, LILO, startup scripts, TCP/IP networking and
cryptography is offered. Concepts and utilities are presented that
are referred to throughout the book.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 4--Necessary basic security issues related
to user and group accounts management, using the root account,
files and directories' permissions as well as file system
restrictions are discussed.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 5--Thoroughly pluggable authentication
modules are presented along with a practical and comprehensive
overview of PAM, its configuration and administration.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 6--An in-depth discussion is offered of two
different one-time password programs, S/Key and OPIE, and how they
reduce considerably the risks associated with system access by
utilizing a password only once.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 7--System and connection accounting are
explained. It describes in detail the commands that allow
information collected by the accounting system to be viewed.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 8--The
<span   class="bold"><b>syslog</b></span> (system logging) utility is
covered in great depth; syslog, its workings and the
/etc/syslog.conf configuration file are all discussed. This chapter
is the most informative piece on syslog I have ever seen.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 9--An explanation of how to obtain, install
and configure the Superuser utility, it talks about
<span   class="bold"><b>sudo's</b></span> options, features and
vulnerabilities.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 10--The features, functionality and
weaknesses of <span   class="bold"><b>inetd</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>TCP_wrappers</b></span>, the
<span   class="bold"><b>portmapper</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>xinetd</b></span> are covered.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 11--Implementation and configuration of the
secure shell, SSH, one of the most important utilities in the
public domain, is explained. The authors describe how to build an
encrypted tunnel between two or more hosts, protecting all aspects
of the communication.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 12--Crack, a tool that attempts to guess
passwords, receives an in-depth explanation of how to build,
configure and use it. The authors did not fail to address the
ethical issues surrounding such a tool.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 13--How to audit the system with Tiger, a
set of scripts and programs that help identify system
vulnerabilities is explained. The authors provide an overview of,
how to obtain, install, configure and use it.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 14--An overview of Tripwire, which acts as
a valuable alarm system. The authors describe how to get, install
and configure it, as well as how to securely store its databases
and configuration files. Any Tripwire user will find this chapter
valuable for its explanations and information.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 15--Two publicly available tools to protect
data through encryption are explored and compared. The
Cryptographic and Transparent Cryptographic Filesystems (CFS and
TCFS) that assist the system administrator secure data.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 16--The focus is on packet filtering with
the <span   class="bold"><b>ipchains</b></span> utility, and how to
configure this utility to limit connections through a Linux system
connected to two different networks.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 17--Log file management as an essential
part of system security and various log management tools, such as
<span   class="bold"><b>logrotate</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>swatch</b></span>, are discussed.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 18--An overview of the book's topics is
offered along with ways to simplify the process of implementing,
configuring and utilizing Linux security features and various
publicly available tools.</p></li></ul></div><p>At the end of the book, there are two appendices. Appendix A
provides a list of web sites, e-mail lists and news groups that
offer additional information about securing computer systems.
Appendix B provides a list of several other tools that were not
covered in the book.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Systems Security</em></span> is an essential
book for system administrators and security professionals. It
covers topics related to Linux systems security with a focus on
freely available tools. The book helps identify system
vulnerabilities and offers plans for security administration. It
highlights how to detect intrusions and how to secure file systems,
e-mail, web servers and other key applications. The book also
emphasizes administrative security duties with discussions of
system accounts, logging, superuser safety and secure network
services.</p><p>A nice feature of the book is that the authors approach the
subject from a practical point of view by emphasizing the use of
software and providing references at the end of each chapter for
further investigation. Another characteristic is the use of many
examples, charts, tables and graphs to illustrate complex processes
and concepts.</p><p>If you depend on Linux to run mission-critical networks, and
you want to protect your Linux system, the procedures outlined in
this book will certainly reduce your system's level of
vulnerability.</p></div></div>
