Use Bitlbee to roll all of your instant-messaging accounts into
an IRC interface and do all your chatting from one place.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10df580.0x11d73b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
To me, IRC is the ideal interface for quick communication with my friends.
I keep a console IRC session (irssi) running on my server at all times
within screen. With that setup, I constantly can lurk in all of the channels
I want to follow and reconnect to the session, no matter what machine I am
using. Because many of my friends use IRC, it's pretty easy to
stay in touch. I can chat with them daily, and if they need to tell me
something when I'm not around, they can leave me a private message, and I
will see it the next time I'm in front of my computer. To me, the IRC
interface is best both for group and private chats&mdash;so much so that I
prefer it to instant messaging.
</p><p>
Of course, not all of my friends use IRC. Even among those who do,
they don't all prefer to do all of their communication there. So, in addition to
IRC, I maintain instant-messaging accounts. This means to keep in touch with
everyone, I need to keep both an IRC and an instant-messaging program open.
Plus, unless I set up a text-based IM client on my server, I'd have to fire
up a local client on whatever computer I'm in front of, which isn't
possible when I'm using someone else's computer. On top of that, some of my
friends have replaced both chat and IM with Twitter, which means yet another
account and yet another program open on my desktop&mdash;well, it would in theory
at least. Instead, I've discovered a few programs that let me roll
everything into IRC sessions, so sending someone an IM is as simple as an
IRC private message, and everyone's Twitter feeds become just another
comment in an IRC channel. In this column, I discuss how to
access your IM accounts from within IRC, and in a follow-up column, I will
talk about how to access Twitter as well, because they each require different
programs.

IRC Instant Messaging with Bitlbee</h2></div></div><p>
The program that makes IM possible within IRC is an IM-to-IRC gateway
called Bitlbee (<a href="http://www.bitlbee.org" target="_self">www.bitlbee.org</a>). Basically, Bitlbee sets up an IRC server on your local
machine that you can connect to like any other IRC server you might already
use. Once you connect to the server, you can join the #bitlbee channel and
authenticate with the bot inside. Then, you can configure Bitlbee with your
Jabber, MSN, Yahoo or Oscar (AIM/ICQ) accounts. Once you are set up, when
your friends are on-line, they join the channel, and when you talk to them or
private-message them inside the IRC channel, it translates it to an instant
message.
</p><p>
Bitlbee should be packaged for most major distributions, so you can install
it like any other program. Otherwise, just pull down and compile the source
code from the main project page. Bitlbee uses inetd, so once you connect to
the IRC port, inetd automatically spawns a Bitlbee process. Depending
on your distribution, the post-install script may or may not
set up the line in inetd.conf automatically. If it doesn't, add the
following line to /etc/inetd.conf:


<pre     class="programlisting">
6667  stream  tcp   nowait  bitlbee /usr/sbin/tcpd  /usr/sbin/bitlbee
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10df580.0x11d7880"></a>
Set Up the Bitlbee Account</h2></div></div><p>
Once Bitlbee is installed, go to your IRC program and connect to a new
server, but in place of the typical hostname, connect to localhost. Once you
connect to the server, join the #bitlbee channel. Bitlbee includes a
built-in help program. Simply type <tt  >help</tt> to see a list of help topics, or type
<tt  >help</tt> followed by a particular Bitlbee bot command to see help for that
command. In addition to these help topics, Bitlbee also includes a
quickstart topic (type <tt  >help quickstart</tt>) that will walk you through setting
up your Bitlbee account and adding your IM accounts (I cover 
these same steps below).
</p><p>
The first thing you need to do before you can IM with Bitlbee is
register an account with the server so that it can save all of your IM
account settings, contacts and other information, and password-protect it.
Type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
register password
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10df580.0x11d7b40"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and replace <tt  >password</tt> with the password you want to use. The next time you
connect to Bitlbee, you must type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
identify password
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10df580.0x11d7cf8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
in the #bitlbee channel so the bot can give you access to your IM accounts. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10df580.0x11d7e00"></a>
Add IM Accounts</h2></div></div><p>
Once you are registered, you can start adding IM accounts. The account
command lets you add or remove accounts from Bitlbee, and the syntax for
adding
an account is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
account add protocol username password server
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >protocol</tt> above should be replaced with jabber,
msn, yahoo or oscar, depending on
which chat protocol your IM account uses. Then, list your user name and
password for that IM account. The final server field is needed only for the
oscar protocol, so it knows whether to connect to the AOL Instant Messenger
server (login.oscar.aol.com) or the ICQ server (login.icq.com). The rest of
the protocols don't need it. So, for instance, if I had an AOL Instant
Messenger account called test with a password of mypassword, I would add it
with the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
account add oscar test mypassword login.oscar.aol.com
</pre>
</p><p>
After you have added all of your IM accounts, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
account on 
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10df580.0x11d8118"></a></h2></div></div><p>
in the #bitlbee channel, and Bitlbee will enable and log in to all of your
accounts. Bitlbee should download your contact list automatically, and those
contacts that are on-line will show up as though they joined the
channel.
Because
Bitlbee renames people on your contact list so they have a more
IRC-friendly name, you might end up with people from different accounts
with similar or at least confusing names. To clear things up, just use the
rename command followed by the old nickname and then the new nickname you
want to use.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10df580.0x11d8278"></a>
Chat in Bitlbee</h2></div></div><p>
Once your accounts are set up, you can chat with any person who is
currently in the #bitlbee channel. Simply type their nickname, followed by a
colon (:), and then say what you want to say. Alternatively, you can use /msg to set up a
private chat, just like with any other IRC channel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10df580.0x11d8380"></a>
Contact List Management</h2></div></div><p>
Once you start using Bitlbee, you probably will get to the point where you
need to add or remove contacts from your contact list. The add and remove
commands take care of this, but first, type: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
account list 
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10df580.0x11d84e0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to get a list of the accounts you have registered and their Bitlbee number.
Then, to add a user, type <tt  >add</tt>, by the number you
saw in the account list
associated with the account, and, finally, add the user's handle. So, if I
wanted to add a user named mybuddy to the first account I set up (so it
would be account 0), I would type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
add 0 mybuddy
</pre>
</p><p>
To remove that user from my contact list, I would type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
remove mybuddy
</pre>
</p><p>
Because Bitlbee gives each user a unique nickname in the
channel, you don't have to specify the IM account with which a nickname is associated
when you remove it.
</p><p>
There you have it. Now you're ready to do all of your IM chatting within
your IRC session. Of course, there are a number of other commands and
settings you can tweak in Bitlbee. To start, type
<tt  >help</tt> and look at all the
available help topics and tutorials within the channel. I recommend you run
through all of the quickstart topics first and then branch out into the
rest of the commands. As for me, I'll be lurking in IRC (such as the
#linuxjournal channel on irc.freenode.net) as always.
