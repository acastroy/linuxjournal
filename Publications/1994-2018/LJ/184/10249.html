Mitigate the damage of setuid root exploits on your system
by removing root's privilege. 
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1046580.0x113e250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
There was a time when, to use a computer, you merely turned it on and were
greeted by a command prompt. Nowadays, most
operating systems offer a security model with multiple users. Typically, the
credentials you present at login determine the amount of privilege that
programs acting upon your behalf will have. Everyday tasks can be
accomplished using unprivileged userids, minimizing the risks due to user
error, accidental execution of malware downloaded from the Internet and so
on. Any
program needing to exercise privilege must be executed using a privileged
userid. In UNIX, that is userid 0, the root user. Unfortunately, this means
any software needing even just a bit of privilege can lead to a
complete system compromise should it misbehave or be attacked
successfully.
</p><p>
POSIX capabilities address this problem in two ways. First, they break the
notion of all-or-nothing privilege into a set of semantically distinct
privileges. This can limit the amount of privilege a task may have,
so that, for example, it only is able to create devices or trace another
users' tasks.
</p><p>
Second, the notion of privilege is separated from userids. Instead,
privilege is wielded by the files (programs) a process executes. After
all, users sitting at the keyboard just invoke programs to run on
their behalf. It is the programs that actually do something. And, it is
the programs that an administrator may entrust with privilege, based
on knowledge of what the program does, who wrote it and who installed it.
</p><p>
POSIX capabilities have been implemented in Linux for years, but until
recently, Linux supported only process capabilities. Because files are
supposed to wield privilege, the lack of file capabilities meant that
Linux required workarounds to allow administrators and system services
to run with privilege. The POSIX capability rules were perverted to
emulate a privileged root user.
</p><p>
Although file capabilities are now supported, the privileged root user
remains the norm. In this article, I demonstrate a lazy prototype
of a system with an unprivileged root.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1046580.0x113e5c0"></a>
POSIX Capabilities Overview</h2></div></div><p>
Each process has three capability sets:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The effective set (pE) contains the capabilities it can use right
now.
</p></li><li><p>
The permitted set (pP) contains those that it can add back into its
effective set.
</p></li><li><p>
The inheritable set (pI) is used to determine its new sets when it executes
a new file.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Files also have effective (fE), permitted (pP) and inheritable (fI) sets
used to calculate the new capability sets of a process executing it.
</p><p>
At any time, a process can use cap_set_proc() to remove capabilities from
any of the three sets.
</p><p>
Capabilities can be added to the effective set only if they are currently
in its permitted set. They never can be added to the permitted set. And,
they can be added to the inheritable set only if they are in the permitted
set or if CAP_SETPCAP is in pE. When a process executes a new file,
its new capability sets are calculated as follows:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The inheritable set remains unchanged.
</p></li><li><p>
The new permitted set is filled with both the file permitted set (masked
with a bounding set, but for this article, I assume that always is full) and any capabilities present in both the file and process inheritable sets.
</p></li><li><p>
Capabilities in the file permitted set will be available to the new
process&mdash;an example use for this is the ping program. Ping 
needs only the capability CAP_NET_RAW in order to craft raw network packets. It is
typically setuid-root, so all users can run it. By
placing CAP_NET_RAW in ping's permitted set, all users will receive
CAP_NET_RAW while running ping.
</p></li><li><p>
Capabilities in the file inheritable set are available to a
process only if they also are in the process inheritable set&mdash;an
example of this would be to allow some users to renice other user's tasks.
Simply arrange (as I explain a bit) for CAP_SYS_NICE to be placed in
their pI on login, as well as in fI for /usr/bin/renice.
Now, ordinary users can run renice without privilege,
and the &ldquo;special&rdquo; users can run renice, but no other programs, with
CAP_SYS_NICE.
</p></li><li><p>
The effective set is by default empty, or, if the legacy bit is set
(see The File Effective Set, aka the Legacy Bit sidebar), it is set to the new permitted set.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1046580.0x113ee58"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
The File Effective Set, aka the Legacy Bit</b></p><p>
Linux has an unfortunate discrepancy between the setcap command API
and what it actually does. Although setcap expects the user to define
a file effective set, the kernel simply knows about a &ldquo;legacy
bit&rdquo;.
Practically speaking, if the file effective set is empty,
the legacy bit is not set. If all bits in the file permitted and
inheritable sets are in the effective set, the legacy bit is
set. If only a subset of those bits are in the effective set,
setcap will return an error.
</p><p>
The reasoning for the setcap API command is that Linux is loathe
to change userspace APIs. The reason for using the legacy bit
is that we want to encourage applications to begin with an empty
effective set if they are capability-aware. Hence, the file
effective set should be empty unless the application is not
capability-aware. But if the application is not capability-aware,
all capabilities available to it must be in its effective set
from the start.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1046580.0x113f118"></a>
The Privileged Root</h2></div></div><p>
As mentioned previously, Linux continues to emulate a privileged root
user. This is done by perverting the capabilities behavior of exec()
and setuid(). Briefly, if your effective userid is 0 when you execute
a file, or if you execute a setuid root file, your permitted
and effective sets are filled. If only your &ldquo;real&rdquo; userid is 0 (for
instance, a root-owned process executes a setuid-nonroot file), only
your permitted set is filled. When you change part of your userid from
root to nonroot, your effective capability set is cleared. When you
permanently change your userid from root to nonroot, your permitted set
is cleared as well. And, if you switch your effective userid back to root,
your permitted set is copied back into your effective set.
</p><p>
This behavior is controlled by a per-process set of securebits.
One controls the setuid() behavior, and another controls the exec() behavior. They
can be turned on using prctl(), and they can be locked such that neither the
task nor its descendants can turn the bits back off.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1046580.0x113f2d0"></a>
System Preparation</h2></div></div><p>
In order to exploit POSIX capabilities fully, both kernel and userspace
must be set up properly. The easiest and safest way to experiment with
such core changes is to do so in a virtual machine. Although everything
shown here could just as well be done on your native Linux installation,
for simplicity, I assume you are installing a minimal, stock
Fedora system under qemu or kvm.
</p><p>
My first working prototype of a rootless system was done on a Gentoo
system. Ubuntu Intrepid and SLES11 should come with file capabilities
enabled. However, Fedora 10 wins as being the most capability-ready
distribution to date, so I use it for this demonstration. To get
started, download a Fedora 10 DVD from <a href="http://download.fedoraproject.org" target="_self">download.fedoraproject.org</a> (call
the file f10.iso), then create a qemu hard disk image and boot kvm using:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# qemu-img create f10.img 6G
# kvm -hda f10.img -cdrom f10.iso -m 512M -boot d
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, proceed with the Fedora installation instructions. Make
sure to install software development, and skip office and
productivity tools for this image.
</p><p>
After rebooting, disable SELinux through the menu entries
System&rarr;Administration&rarr;SELinux management. Change the top entry from
Enforcing to Disabled, then reboot. Although there is no inherent reason
why SELinux cannot be used with file capabilities, it does require some
SELinux policy modifications.
</p><p>
Because you will be removing the root user's privilege, you'll want other
users to receive ambient privileges at login. This is done using the
pam_cap.so PAM module. To enable its use, add the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
auth required pam_cap.so
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1046580.0x113f698"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to /etc/pam.d/system-auth. The order of these entries
<span   class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> matter, and
improper order can prevent your entry from being used. I made it the second
entry, after pam_env.so. Now, test by creating a user with some
privilege:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# adduser -m netadmin
# passwd netadmin
# for f in /sbin/ifconfig /sbin/ip /sbin/route; do
#   setcap cap_net_admin=ei $f
# done
</pre>
</p><p>
The above creates user netadmin and sets his password, then adds the
cap_net_admin capability to the inheritable and effective sets for three
network configuration programs. If you now type <tt  >ls
/sbin/ifconfig</tt>,
you'll notice the entry is marked in red. This is similar to how setuid
binaries, such as /bin/ping, are marked, and it's a nice touch to let
you easily tell which binaries ought to be treated with extra care
or to detect mistaken privilege leakage.
</p><p>
You also must create the /etc/security/capability.conf file, which
pam_cap.so will consult on each login. The file should contain:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cap_net_admin netadmin
none *
</pre>
</p><p>
The first line says that when user netadmin logs in, pam_cap.so should add
the cap_net_admin capability to pI for its login shell. The second line,
which is very important, says that everyone else (*) should receive
no capabilities. Now, log in as user netadmin and play with the network:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hallyn@kvm# su - netadmin
netadmin@kvm# ifconfig eth0 down
</pre>
</p><p>
Success! You just downed the network as a nonroot user.
</p><p>
Now you're ready to make root unprivileged. As a first step,
you will just restrict network logins over SSH. To make this as easy 
as possible, simply start sshd through a wrapper that
sets and locks all securebits before calling the real sshd. The source
for the wrapper is shown in Listing 1.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1046580.0x113fb10"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. Wrapper to Execute a Program with Unprivileged Root</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/prctl.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/capability.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char * argv[])
{
    int   i, ret;
    char  *cmd;
    char  **argvp;
    cap_t cap = cap_get_proc();
    int   v[CAP_LAST_CAP+1];

    if (!cap)
        return -1;

    for (i=0; i&lt;=CAP_LAST_CAP; i++)
        v[i] = i;

    if (cap_set_flag(cap, CAP_INHERITABLE,
                     CAP_LAST_CAP+1, v, CAP_SET))
        return -1;

    if (cap_set_proc(cap))
        return -1;

    cap_free(cap);

    ret = prctl(PR_SET_SECUREBITS, 0xf);
    if (ret) {
        perror("prctl securebits");
        exit(ret);
    }
    argvp = &amp;argv[1];
    cmd   = argvp[0];
    ret   = execv(cmd, argvp);
    perror("execv");
    return ret;
}

</pre></div><p>
The wrapper locks itself into secure_noroot and secure_nosuidfixup
mode using the prctl() system call. Then, it executes its first argument
(ssh), passing the remaining arguments to the newly executed program,
ssh. Compile capwrap, and copy it into /sbin:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# gcc -o capwrap capwrap.c -lcap
# cp capwrap /sbin/
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, edit /etc/init.d/sshd to execute capwrap. Find the start() function,
and place /sbin/capwrap in front of the line that actually executes
sshd. That line then becomes:

<pre     class="programlisting">

/sbin/capwrap $SSHD $OPTIONS &amp;&amp; success || failure

</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, sshd will require some privilege to change userid and groupid
among other things. Being lazy, for now, just set all
capabilities using the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hallyn@kvm# setcap all=ei /usr/sbin/sshd
</pre>
</p><p>
If you try restarting sshd right now, you'll be met with a silent failure.
Instead, try this to start it by hand and see debugging output:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hallyn@kvm# /etc/init.d/sshd stop
hallyn@kvm# /sbin/capwrap /usr/sbin/sshd -Dd
</pre>
</p><p>
Among other things, you'll see:

<pre     class="programlisting">
debug1: permanently_set_uid: 74/74
permanently_set_uid: was able to restore old [e]gid
</pre>
</p><p>
sshd is complaining that it is able to restore its uid after switching
to uid 74 (the ssh userid). This is problematic. Because you locked ssh
into nosuid_fixup mode, switching from uid 0 to a non-0 uid does not
clear out pE automatically. This means the process keeps CAP_SETUID and
CAP_SETGID, so it is able to reset itsuid to 0 at any time.
</p><p>
The right solution is to modify the sshd source to separate the privilege
handling from the userid handling. But, for this experiment, let's just
stop sshd from complaining! It is wrong, but perhaps not quite as bad
as it seems, because when sshd executes the user's login shell, pP and pE
will be recalculated anyway.
</p><p>
Download opensshd_caps.patch (see Resources), and use the following
steps to apply the above patch:


<pre     class="programlisting">

# yum install audit-libs-devel tcp_wrappers-devel libedit-devel
# yumdownloader --source openssh
# rpm -i openssh-*.rpm
# cd /root/rpmbuild/
# rpmbuild -bc SPECS/openssh*
# cd BUILD/openssh-*/
# patch &lt; /usr/src/opensshd_caps.patch
# make &amp;&amp; make install
# setcap all=ei /usr/sbin/sshd
# /etc/init.d/sshd start

</pre>
</p><p>
Now <tt  >ssh</tt> in as root, and use capsh to print your capability status:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@kvm# /sbin/capsh --print
Current: =
Bounding set =(full set of capabilities)
Securebits: 057/0x2f
secure-noroot: yes (locked)
secure-no-suid-fixup: yes (locked)
secure-keep-caps: no (unlocked)
uid=0
</pre>
</p><p>
SSH logins are locked in secure-noroot and secure-nosuid-fixup.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1046580.0x1136c38"></a>
Setting Up Administrative Users</h2></div></div><p>
The root userid now carries no privileges, but the system still requires
administration. That requires privilege. So, let's define several
partially privileged users. At login, each will receive inheritable
capabilities sufficient to achieve some task. Working out the most
useful combinations of capabilities to assign to select users is an
interesting exercise, but for now let's focus on three users: netadmin,
which can change network settings; useradmin, which can add and delete
users, kill their processes and modify their files; and privadmin,
which can change file capabilities and users' inheritable capabilities.
</p><p>
Create the users:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# adduser -m privadmin
# passwd privadmin
# adduser -m useradmin
# passwd useradmin
# chown privadmin /etc/security/capability.conf
</pre>
</p><p>
The new capability.conf file follows:


<pre     class="programlisting">
cap_net_admin netadmin
cap_chown,cap_dac_overide,cap_fowner,cap_kill useradmin
cap_setfcap privadmin
none *
</pre>
</p><p>
privadmin may set file capabilities (cap_setfcap), so make him
the owner of the capabilities.conf file, so he can set pI for
users. useradmin can manipulate other users' files and processes. netadmin
remains unchanged. (Note, privadmin can give himself whatever privilege he
wants. A good audit policy and a limited tool for editing capability.conf
would help mitigate that risk.)
</p><p>
You also need to set some inheritable file capabilities on system
administration utilities to grant these users privilege. Listing
2 shows a small list to get started. For brevity, let's just assign
all capabilities to the inheritable set. You can apply these using the
script in Listing 3 using <tt  >sh loopcaps.sh
admincaplist</tt>. Finally, you'll
need to let useradmin execute useradd using <tt  >chmod o+x
/usr/sbin/useradd</tt>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1046580.0x1137058"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

    for f in `/bin/ls $flglob`; do
        setcap $p $f
    done
done
</pre></div><p>
Now, log in as each of these users and play around.
</p><p>
There are still a few problems though. For instance, log in as
useradmin and try to change someone's password:

<pre     class="programlisting">
useradmin@kvm# passwd netadmin
passwd: Only root can specify a user name.
</pre>
</p><p>
That's no good! The passwd program has noticed that you are not root and
won't let you change another user's password. We are finding more and
more code, written to accommodate the subtleties of different operating
systems, which would now need to be further complicated to support our
unprivileged-root model.
</p><p>
You can work around this case for now in one of two easy ways. First,
you simply can use the root user instead of useradmin. The root user 
still will not carry privileges unless it executes a (trusted) file with file
capabilities. Second, you can continue to use the useradmin user name, but
give it userid 0. Go ahead and try that. Edit /etc/passwd.conf,
find the entry for useradmin, and change the first numeric column to
0. Then <tt  >chown -R 0 /home/useradmin</tt>, so that he still
can access his
home directory. Now, you can log out and back in, and passwd will
succeed. Actually, it ends with an error message, but you'll find that
you did actually succeed in changing the password.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1046580.0x1137688"></a>
Locking Down init</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have some partially privileged administrative users, let's
put the whole system in unprivileged-root mode. You could do this by
patching the kernel, but in this case, let's patch init to use prctl()
the same way that capwrap did. A patch to upstart, the Fedora init
program, can be found in the Resources. You can apply it using steps
similar to the openssh steps:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# yumdownloader --source upstart
# rpm -i upstart*.rpm
# cd rpmbuild
# rpmbuild -bc SPECS/upstart.spec
# cd BUILD/upstart*
# patch -p1 &lt; /usr/src/upstart.patch
# cp /sbin/init /sbin/init.orig
# make &amp;&amp; make install

</pre>
</p><p>
Also, in case something goes wrong, edit /boot/grub/grub.conf,
comment out hiddenmenu, and set timeout to 10 instead of 0. Now
if something goes wrong, you can interrupt the boot process and add
<tt  >init=/sbin/init.orig</tt> to the end of your boot line.
</p><p>
The patched init enables all capabilities in its inheritable set. It also
keeps its permitted and effective sets filled, although you should be able
to drop many from its permitted set, keeping its effective set empty
for most of its run. You will need to add file capabilities to many of
the programs used during system startup. Ideally, you would modify each
of these programs so as to avoid setting the legacy bit, but again this
is a lazy proof of concept. Listing 4 contains a list that is
sufficient for boot to succeed on the F10 image.

You can apply these with the same script as before (Listing 3).
</p><p>
You'll also need to execute:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod go-x /usr/sbin/console-kit-daemon
</pre>
</p><p>
You're giving it forced rather than inherited permissions in lieu of
changing the (setuid-root) dbus-daemon-launch-helper code so as to fill
its inheritable set. This means any user would receive full privilege
when executing it, so you allow only root to execute it.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This article demonstrates taking a stock Fedora 10 system and changing the privilege system
from one where one userid (root's) automatically imparts privilege,
to one where only file capabilities determine the privilege available
to a caller. The root user turns from a privileged user to simply the
userid that happens to own most system resources.
</p><p>
You can remove the privileged root user for a whole system. In this
experiment, quite a bit of work still needs to be done to make
that practical, say, for a whole distribution. Most important, legacy
code makes assumptions based on userids. Setting up partially privileged
users make system administration convenient, while making the
privilege separation useful will be an interesting project.
</p><p>
In the meantime, you can exploit the per-process nature of the
unprivileged-root mode. This article shows how to remove the privileged
root user from any legacy software that always is intended to be
unprivileged. You also should design new services to be capability-aware
so that they too can run without a privileged root. Doing so can greatly
reduce the impact of any bugs or exploits.
