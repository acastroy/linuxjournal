toe to toe on one of the hottest Internet waves to hit in recent memory.

That's right, we're covering microblogging&mdash;more specifically, Twitter.
Kyle thinks Twitter is just another rehash of tried-and-true tech, while
Bill
thinks it fills an interesting niche in people's on-line lives. What's the
reality though? Read on to find out. (Bill is simu-tweeting this, so his
replies are limited to 140 characters, just to prove that Twitter
<span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> be
useful.)
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Kyle, I found a Twitter client for
you. It's text-based and plugs in to
an IRC client like another channel. It might help with your Web 2.0 hate.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> You know, if I could add it as yet another IRC channel or tie Bitlbee
into it, then I probably would. That way, it wouldn't be that annoying, just
another thing to lurk in.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Besides, Shawn Powers is on Twitter.
You can tweet with more people than
just me. It'll be fun!
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Bill, forget it. Someone already took greenfly. It's not fun if they
took my name.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Wow. I can see you pout from here.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Oh well, I'll just wait for the next bandwagon. One's bound to
clatter by any time now. Or, maybe I'll just use IRC or IM to do the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>exact
same thing</em></span>.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Kyle, I thought the same thing. I was so wrong. Twitter isn't
anything like chat.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Yeah, well, Twitter matches your
iPhone better. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Kyle follows Bill's
mom.</em></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Hey, leave my mom out of this. Besides, she's not on Twitter. The
closest to that is my sister, who is on Facebook.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Okay, Bill. It's obvious you like Twitter. But seriously, why is
someone who's &ldquo;following&rdquo; you different from someone having you on a buddy
list or being in an IRC room?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Because Twitter is totally public.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> So is IRC; it's just not written in AJAX.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Not that way. At any given time there is a limited number of people
in an IRC room. With Twitter, my content is open to the whole world...
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span>
...whether they follow or not. Not only is it visible to everyone, but
others can respond to it without following me.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Nice cheat there. Having to hack around the limitations of your
service.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Some see it as a feature that enables creativity by constraining
the amount of content. It's quality, not quantity.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Considering all the posts that talk about what someone had for lunch,
I don't know that everyone on Twitter shoots for quality either. Really,
people use Twitter like a chatroom. You can replace &ldquo;what are you doing
right now?&rdquo; with what you put in an IM or IRC away message.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Sometimes, but it's more like a blog or threaded forum. Have you
heard the term microblogging? It fits Twitter perfectly.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> So basically, it's IRC applied to
cell phones. I will give you this
though, with Twitter, at least there are fewer normal blogs full of
one-sentence-long posts linking to other content.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> How can you argue that when you've
not even <span   class="emphasis"><em>tried</em></span> it?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> They took my screen name, so there's little point in using it.
&ldquo;Krankin&rdquo; isn't nearly as fun as &ldquo;greenfly&rdquo;.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Let me get this straight. Because you can't get your handle on Twitter,
it's a useless, duplicate service?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> No, it was a useless and redundant
service before I tried it, but now
that I can't have the handle, I also have no motivation to do it as a favor
to you.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Okay, I get that you're annoyed. But admit it, you're still judging
without fully understanding. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> What's there to understand? People
read text; people occasionally
reply to text. You get into a group with certain people and all of them see
what you write and (potentially) vice versa.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> The difference is the audience is broader. Broader than arguably a
blog. You could use it as a good marketing tool, if you quit judging.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span>
But noooo, just go ahead and sit in your tower, and pout.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> It's just that I don't see it filling a need that wasn't already
filled with IM and IRC. I honestly think half the reason it's so popular
is everyone from all the news outlets, celebrities and now Oprah have all
jumped on the bandwagon, so they can seem hip and on the cutting edge of
this modern age. When they talk about tweeting, it just reminds me of
everyone stumbling over MySpace a few years ago. Once everyone's mom got an
account, they made a mass exodus. I think the same thing will happen soon
with Twitter, once it's no longer a hip, niche technology.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Perhaps that will happen. But Twitter is not anything like MySpace. I
think of Twitter more like the old UNIX wall command...
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span>
...you shout out what you want to say and not only do your followers
see it, but it also winds up on the Twitter main page...
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span>...and if it's actually usable, your followers can tell others. Word
spreads very quickly via that path (retweeting).
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span>
Texting is a valid form of communication. Twitter takes texting and
extends it to the Web and the world.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> One final thing is that even though
Twitter's API is opened up so you can
write your own client, you still are beholden to its servers to use the
service. At least with IRC, if I don't like any of the available servers, I
can start up my own IRC d&aelig;mon on my own hardware. At least, with IRC
and IM,
it's not painful to have a low-latency real-time conversation with others.
The bottom line for me is I just don't see anything special you can do with
Twitter that couldn't be done better with other technologies that let you
write more than one sentence at a time.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> That will change with time. Laconica/Identica offer a microblogging
service that's open, free and federated. Much like AIM...
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span>
...that IM service was and is closed. Jabber has since come along and
surpassed it. I suspect Laconica will do the same.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span>
Whatever your opinion, Kyle, it's likely that microblogging will be
around. It may be a niche, but it's a useful niche.
