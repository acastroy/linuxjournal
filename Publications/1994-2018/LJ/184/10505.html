Rootkits using /dev/mem could attack your system and
leave virtually no trace&mdash;it even could be happening now!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xebb580.0xfb33b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
At Black Hat Europe in mid-April 2009, Anthony Lineberry presented an
interesting paper on how attackers with root privileges might use a
/dev/mem rootkit, hiding their attacks by directly altering kernel memory.
Although not a completely new technique, Anthony's BHE presentation put it
back in the spotlight. In addition, Lineberry described proof-of-concept
tools he's developing to demonstrate how this technique could be exploited
in the real world.
</p><p>
On the one hand, once attackers have gained root privileges on your
system, it's game over&mdash;the attackers have complete control, and all hope
for further defense and mitigation on your part is gone. Looked at from
that viewpoint, the attackers' ability to write directly to kernel memory
isn't too radically different from, or worse than, other things they can do as
root.
</p><p>
But, on the other hand, even if your system suffers root compromise, you
still want <span   class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span> chance of at least
<span   class="emphasis"><em>detecting</em></span> the compromise in
order to do something about it. Because the purpose of rootkits is to prevent
that, it behooves you to take whatever precautions you can against them. So
in this sense, new rootkit techniques actually are very worthy of our
attention and concern.
</p><p>
In this article, I provide some background on rootkits and
/dev/mem, and Anthony Lineberry sheds further light on
/dev/mem rootkits, in the form of a conversation we recently had.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xebb580.0xfb3778"></a>
Rootkit Refresher</h2></div></div><p>
So, what exactly is a rootkit? Simply put, a rootkit is hostile code that
conceals or misrepresents a system's state, as presented to its
administrator.
</p><p>
The &ldquo;kit&rdquo; part of the term reflects the fact that early UNIX rootkits took
the form of collections of one-for-one replacements of system commands,
such as
ls and ps. The replacement commands behaved, for the most part, like the
commands they replaced, except they were selectively blind. A rootkit's
ls command, for example, might omit the attacker's directory
/...my_evil_tools in file listings it displays, and a rootkit's ps
command might omit the attacker's program erase_recent_logs from process
listings.
In other words, rootkits are designed to conceal the activities of system
attackers once they've achieved a foothold on a target system.
</p><p>
One problem with first-generation rootkits was that their functionality was
limited to those specific commands replaced by rootkit versions. What if
the system administrator used some command or utility rather than ls to
view the contents of a directory containing attack evidence?
</p><p>
Another problem was detectability. If a system is protected with system
integrity software like Tripwire, which detects and reports on authorized
changes to system files, it can be difficult to replace system commands
without being detected.
</p><p>
Both these problems were largely &ldquo;solved&rdquo; with the advent of Loadable
Kernel Module (LKM) rootkits. An LKM rootkit, as the name implies, consists
of one or more kernel modules loaded by attacks. An LKM rootkit
re-maps the actual <span   class="emphasis"><em>system calls</em></span> (also known as kernel symbols)
accessed by system utilities, leaving the system commands themselves
unchanged. Needless to say, this is a very powerful technique.
</p><p>
As powerful as LKM rootkits still are, they nonetheless can be detected,
for example, by comparing the kernel's system map (a file showing the
correct memory addresses of all supported system calls) with the actual
system call addresses in memory. On a non-LKM-infested system, those
addresses should be the same as in the system map.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xebb580.0xfb3b40"></a>
/dev/mem and /dev/kmem</h2></div></div><p>
That, then, is the problem space in which rootkits operate&mdash;concealing attack
activity and results in a way that is not itself conspicuous. But, what is
/dev/mem, and how is this particular kernel interface different from an
LKM?
</p><p>
/dev/mem is a character device that provides root-privileged processes in
userspace (that is, programs other than the kernel or kernel modules)
direct access to physical memory. /dev/kmem is the same thing, but it uses
&ldquo;virtual&rdquo; memory addresses like the kernel uses rather than
the &ldquo;raw&rdquo;
addresses of physical memory. Unlike /proc/kcore, which serves a similar
function to developers and kernel hackers, /dev/mem and /dev/kmem grant not
only read access, but also write access to memory.
</p><p>
You might be forgiven for assuming that, like /dev/eth0, /dev/hda and
other special files in /dev, /dev/mem is an essential interface for
userspace applications that need to communicate with the kernel. As it
happens, this isn't necessarily the case. Besides kernel developers,
historically, the other major user of /dev/mem is the X Window System, parts
of which still use /dev/mem to access video adapters' memory and control
registers.
</p><p>
At least in the case of /dev/kmem, some people think these particular
devices are of greater use to attackers than for more legitimate purposes.
As far back as 2005, Jonathan Corbet of lwn.net said, &ldquo;It has been suggested
that rootkits are the largest user community for this kind of
access&rdquo; (see
Resources for the full context; he was speaking specifically of
/dev/kmem).
</p><p>
Hopefully, I'm not overstating this case, because being neither a kernel
developer nor an X Windows System expert, I would not presume to argue for
abolishing /dev/mem or /dev/kmem myself. Rather, I'm trying to put all of
this into a useful context&mdash;which brings us to Anthony Lineberry.

The Interview</h2></div></div><p>
Anthony Lineberry is a security software engineer and Linux security
researcher. The concept of using /dev/kmem to rootkit Linux systems
was first written about by Silvio Cesare in 1998 and by devik in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Phrack</em></span>
magazine in 2001. Besides bringing this seldom-discussed attack vector back
to people's attention, Anthony Lineberry has uncovered some new ways of
tricking the kernel to allocate memory for injected code.
Anthony and I chatted via e-mail immediately before and after his Black Hat
Europe presentation.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> Hi, Anthony. Thanks for taking the
time to talk to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>! It
looks like this attack has ramifications very similar to those of the
Loadable Kernel Module rootkit. Obviously, this isn't the best forum
for a detailed dissertation, but could you describe your /dev/mem attack for
our readers?
</p><p>
AL: We are essentially using the mem device to inject code
directly into the kernel. /dev/mem is just a character device that provides
an interface to physically addressable memory. Seeking to an offset and
performing a read will read from that physical location in memory.
Translating virtual addresses in the kernel to the physical addresses they
map to, you can use simple reads and writes to this device to hot-patch code
directly into the kernel. Using various heuristics, you can locate various
important structures in the kernel and manipulate them. At that point, you
are able to control behavior and manipulate almost anything inside the
kernel,
including system call tables, process lists, network I/O and so on.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> Does the attacker have to be root to locate and manipulate these
structures in memory?
</p><p>
AL: Yes, you would definitely have to be root to be able to read/write to
this device and manipulate any structures inside the kernel.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> How does this differ from LKM rootkits?
</p><p>
AL: LKMs, in general, will create a lot of &ldquo;noise&rdquo; when loaded into the
kernel. Using these techniques, we avoid all of that because of the fact
that we are injecting directly into physical memory. Using an LKM does make
it much easier to develop a rootkit. All of the effort can go into the
actual code, rather than having to determine reliably where everything is
inside the kernel. Although we can read/parse the export table inside
kernel memory to locate almost all exported symbols.
</p><p>
The general suggested way to mitigate kernel rootkits for Linux is to
configure a non-modular kernel and have all devices being used compiled
in. In this scenario, we are still able to get code into kernel space.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> Have you tested the attack in virtualized environments? Does
virtualized memory behave any differently?
</p><p>
AL: Yes, these methods will work in a virtualized environment. The main
difference I ran into was that some special instructions handled by
hypervisors behaved differently. Specifically in this case, the lidt
instruction I used for locating the IDT/System Call Table in memory would
return a bogus virtual address, but these problems were mostly trivial to
overcome.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span>
What are the best defenses against /dev/mem attacks?
</p><p>
AL: The best defense is to enable CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM (originally called
CONFIG_NONPROMISC_DEVMEM in 2.6.26) in the kernel, which limits all
operations on the mem device to the first 256 pages (1MB) of physical
memory. This limitation will allow things like X and DOSEMU, which use this
device legitimately to still function properly, but keep anyone else from
reading outside of those low areas of memory. Unfortunately, the default
configuration leaves this protection disabled.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> Have you contacted any of the major Linux distributors (Red Hat,
Novell and so forth)? Have any of them committed to enabling this setting in
their default kernels?
</p><p>
AL: No, [although] many major distros do enable this setting by default in
their releases. I would like to plan on compiling a list of who
does/doesn't enable this.

Some Notes on Mitigation</h2></div></div><p>
As Anthony said, short of ripping /dev/mem and /dev/kmem out of your kernel
(which almost certainly would break things, especially in the X Window
System), the best defense is to compile CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM=y in your
kernel. The default kernels for Fedora and Ubuntu systems already have this
option compiled in. RHEL goes a step further, by using an SELinux policy
that also restricts access to /dev/mem.
</p><p>
If you don't know whether your system's kernel was compiled with
CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM=y, there are several different ways to find
out.
Depending on your Linux distribution, your system's running kernel's
configuration file may be stored in /boot, with a name like
config-2.6.28-11-generic. If so, you can grep that file for DEVMEM. If
not, your kernel may have a copy of its configuration in the form of a file
called /proc/config.gz, in which case you can use the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
zcat /proc/config.gz | grep DEVMEM
</pre>
</p><p>
Otherwise, you need to obtain source code for your running kernel, do a
<tt  >make oldconfig</tt> (which actually extracts your running kernel's
configuration), and check the resulting .config file. In any of these
cases, if CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM is set to n rather than
y, you need to
compile a custom kernel.
</p><p>
To do so, after having done <tt  >make oldconfig</tt>, which even if you already
knew your kernel lacked CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM enablement is a good idea,
because you're probably interested in only changing CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM
and leaving the rest of the kernel the same, you can do either <tt  >make
menuconfig</tt> or <tt  >make xconfig</tt>. In the resulting menu, select kernel
hacking, look for the option Filter access to /dev/mem, set it to
y, exit, save your configuration, and re-compile.
</p><p>
If this entire kernel-compiling process is new to you, refer
to your Linux distribution's official documentation for more detailed
instructions. The process of compiling a custom kernel is, nowadays, rather
distribution-specific, especially if you want to generate a custom RPM or
deb package (which is the least disruptive way to actually
<span   class="emphasis"><em>install</em></span> a
custom kernel on RPM- and deb-package-based systems).
