More examples of using the shell to find the frequency
of letters used in the English language.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbae580.0xca6358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Time and again I have entreated you, dear readers, with my plea for &ldquo;A
letter! My column, nay, my kingdom for a reader letter!&rdquo;
And lo, the miracle occurred, the heavens parted, the angels sang and a
letter arrived:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
In addition to the letter and word frequency, how about looking at how frequently
a letter appears as the first letter of a word? Just to make things more
interesting, what is the frequency of two-letter combinations? For instance,
if the first letter of a two-letter combination is a t, what is the most
frequent second letter?
Thanks for the article in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>. It was a good read and nice
scripts.&mdash;Mike Short
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quando omni flunkus moritati.</em></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
First off, before I even read the letter, I was intrigued by the closing
quote. Latin? Isn't that, like, a dead language? Turns out the
quote's a good one though, especially for IT admins in big companies.
It roughly translates to &ldquo;when all else fails, play dead&rdquo;, and it
comes from the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Red Green Show</em></span>, a Canadian comedy.
(Thanks Google.)
</p><p>
Now, on to the heart of the letter. Mike's referring to an earlier
column where we looked at how to use shell scripts to ascertain letter and
word usage, using three books as source material:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dracula</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>A History of the
United States</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pride and Prejudice</em></span>, all downloaded from Project
Gutenberg.
</p><p>
In that series of columns, we ascertained that the ten most common letters
in the English language are e, t, a, o, n, i, s, r, h and d. Are they the same if we
constrain it to just the first letter of words? Let's find out.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbae580.0xca69e0"></a>
Extracting Just the First Letter of Words</h2></div></div><p>
Once we have a corpus of writing and the ability to break it down by words,
so that the input stream to the counting script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
is
like
this
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbae580.0xca6b40"></a></h2></div></div><p>
it's done like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat dracula.txt | tr ' ' '\
' | grep -v '[^[:alpha:]]' | grep -v "^$"
</pre>
</p><p>
That'll turn <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dracula</em></span> into the world's narrowest book, with one word
per line.
</p><p>
Now we simply can add to it to axe all but the first letter by appending
<tt  >cut -c1</tt>. The result looks like one of those streams of
letters in <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Matrix</em></span>, but that's another story.
</p><p>
So, all that's left is to translate uppercase into lowercase, sort, and
then use our friend <tt  >uniq -c</tt> to tally up the results:


<pre     class="programlisting">
tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head
</pre>
</p><p>
And, the resultant top ten are:

<pre     class="programlisting">
20648 t
15787 a
11110 i
10655 w
9906 h
9030 s
7618 o
5720 m
5411 b
4597 f
</pre>
</p><p>
Quite different! Now, the question is, does it change based on the type of
content? Let's do the same command, but this time, let's feed in
all three of our books, not just <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dracula</em></span> (though with
the rabid &lt;cough
cough&gt; popularity of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Twilight</em></span>, maybe <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> would do well to stick
with a vampire theme for a few issues?):

<pre     class="programlisting">
34359 t
27053 a
18212 w
18119 h
17854 i
15746 s
13614 o
10076 b
9792 m
7712 f
</pre>
</p><p>
It's not exactly the same. Isn't that interesting? I'm not sure
what to make of it, but as you can see, a good grasp of shell script
commands makes finding out this sort of fairly goofy information
interesting.

Calculating Digraphs</h2></div></div><p>
But, we're not quite done, because Mike also wondered about two-letter
combinations. It's this sort of query that really shows just how
helpful becoming savvy on the command line can be. To calculate that
requires only one character to be changed in the command invoked above.
Do you know what it is?
</p><p>
It's the cut command. Above, we're specifying that we 
want only the very first character of each line of input with <tt  >cut
-c1</tt>. If we want the first two, we simply can tweak that command flag
as appropriate.
</p><p>
But, <tt  >-c2</tt> won't work, because that'll give us only the
second letter of each word (and the most common second letter in the
English language is o, followed by h, e, a and n).
</p><p>
Instead, we need to use a letter range, which looks like this:
<tt  >-c1-2</tt>. The result of that invocation is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
22100 th
10168 an
9138 to
7508 he
7100 of
5873 i&lt;space&gt;
5517 in
5332 ha
5157 be
4664 wh
</pre>
</p><p>
There ya go, Mike. The most common two-letter combination in the English
language is th, which actually makes some sense, followed as a
distant second by an.
</p><p>
I hope it's trivially obvious how you could use this to calculate
the most common three-letter combinations (it should be no surprise at all
that <span   class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> is the most common three letter combo, followed by
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span>).
</p><p>
I'll wrap up here, but again, I invite you to send me your letters and
queries so we can explore various ways to use shell scripts.
