marave&mdash;Stylish Text Editing
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/marave" target="_self">code.google.com/p/marave</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
If you're the kind of person who's been using Blackbox and its
derivatives for the past decade, the kind of person who has just a single
CD in a spotless but stylish car, the kind of person who likes minimalism
but with effortless style, then boy, have I got a project for you.
To quote the marave Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Inspired by ommwriter and other similar projects, marave (it means
&ldquo;nothing&rdquo; or &ldquo;it doesn't matter&rdquo; in
guaran&iacute;) aims to be a simple,
clean text editor that doesn't distract you from your writing.
</p><p>
You can have a nice background, or just a color. You can have a
real-time spellchecker or not. Syntax highlighting or not. You can have
background music, keyboard feedback or silence. marave will try to be
the way you want it to be.
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10788f1.large.jpg"><img src="10788f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
marave makes the dull world of text editing romantic and immersive with
beautiful minimalism&mdash;quite a mix.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10788f2.large.jpg"><img src="10788f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
marave can use different themes (or none at all), as well as play Internet
radio. Here, I'm using it to edit this month's article.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Project maintainer Roberto Alsina is hoping to integrate marave 
into most distros soon, but for now, the only packages available are for
Arch Linux and Fedora. If you use another distro, your only option is
the source, but that's okay, because installing the source is pretty easy.
</p><p>
In terms of requirements, the documentation says you need the following libraries:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
GNU source-highlight (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite" target="_self">www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite</a>).
</p></li><li><p>
Source-highlight-qt (<a href="http://srchiliteqt.sourceforge.net" target="_self">srchiliteqt.sourceforge.net</a>).
</p></li><li><p>
SIP, which should come with PyQt.
</p></li><li><p>
A C++ compiler.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Assuming you're going with the source, head to the Web site, grab the
latest tarball, extract it, and open a terminal in the new folder.
</p><p>
If your distro uses sudo, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo python setup.py install
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro doesn't use sudo, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ su
(enter your password)
# python setup.py install
</pre>
</p><p>
Once that's done, run marave with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ marave-editor
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
The first thing you'll notice when you're inside is that the entire
desktop has disappeared and you are in a single full-screen program. This
is unabashed full-screen editing, designed to immerse you and cut out
distractions. As if to reinforce this ethic, the few existing GUI elements
on the side disappear until you move your mouse again, leaving you with
only your text, a blinking cursor and a scroll bar.
</p><p>
But, enough of the straight minimalism. What really impresses me is the
look of the thing. It's a sleek and undeniably gorgeous environment in
which
to work. An amusing touch for those who like a bit of flair (and have
possibly been watching too many Hollywood movies) is a click noise for
whenever you press the keyboard, adding a bit of romance to the
otherwise dreary world of typing.
</p><p>
As for some of the other features, it's time we explore those GUI
elements that usually are hidden away to the right of the scroll bar. The
first button at the top allows you to change the font, as well as the
color. The magnifying button has a submenu to zoom your
text in and out, which is actually one of my favorite features of this
program. The blank sheet of paper button has a menu with all the usual
functions of loading, saving and so on.
</p><p>
Further down is an icon that looks like a camera. The left
and right buttons switch between desktop backgrounds, including various
snowy nature themes and what appears to be a Debian background. The
color wheel at the right also allows you to adjust the background color
and get rid of the background picture completely, if you so desire. The
next button gives you amusing control over what sort of keyboard
click noise you'd like (or whether to disable it). Next up,
there's a music button that lets you play what I think is streaming
music (as well as turn it off). I'd go into this more, but space and
documentation are kind of lacking.
</p><p>
Second from the bottom is a button that looks kind of like a cricket
bat, which appears to bump the text around, but I'm not sure I can 
elaborate much further on it. I found there are a number of GUI
customization options to move around all of your working elements, such
as the text area size and placement, but I also ran into some confusion
(I deleted the config file to reset in the end, after getting myself into
some UI trouble). And as I already mentioned, documentation still is lacking. 
</p><p>
Something that really impressed me was marave's handling of foreign
characters. A file of mine that had both Japanese and Greek characters
mixed in with the Latin alphabet displayed without the slightest hiccup.
</p><p>
I can't help but feel that with a bit of modifying, marave 
also would make a brilliant ebook reader if it could handle files such as
PDFs. Perhaps if in the short term, someone tacked on some code that
would use a PDF-to-text converter, such as pdf2ascii, and then just
piped the output to screen? An environment as cool as this one, with a
full-screen interface, no intruding GUI elements and zooming text, 
easily would dissuade me from getting a commercial ebook device in favor of
simply using marave on a basic Netbook.
</p><p>
What ultimately draws me to the project is that it doesn't just have
minimalism and simplicity, it has minimalism and simplicity combined
with beauty and a palpable design ethic. marave has soul, and I love that.

Storybook&mdash;Novel Writing Organizer
(<a href="http://storybook.intertec.ch" target="_self">storybook.intertec.ch</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
Before I begin, I have to offer a <span   class="emphasis"><em>mea culpa</em></span>. I wrote about this
several months ago in the Projects at a Glance section, promising to cover
it the following month, but it got lost in the noise, and I remembered
it when reading over the section in <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> months later. Apologies to any
Storybook fans and developers! Anyway, on with the show.
</p><p>
To quote the project's Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Storybook is a free (open source) novel-writing tool for creative
writers, novelists and authors that will help you keep an overview
of multiple plot-lines while writing books, novels or other written works.
</p><p>
Storybook assists you in structuring your book.
Store all information about your characters and locations in one
place. Then, use the included Storybook features for managing chapters,
scenes, characters and locations. A simple interface is provided to enable
you to assign your defined characters and locations to each scene and
to keep an overview of your work with user-friendly chart tools.
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10788f3.large.jpg"><img src="10788f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Storybook is a clever tool designed to help you structure a book
and keep track of characters, scenes, locations and so on.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10788f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Given that characters typically are the most important part of a story,
Storybook's character options are wonderfully thought out. Note the
color assignment option&mdash;a brilliant touch for creative types.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10788f5.large.jpg"><img src="10788f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Although the Web site shows a girl using Storybook, trust me, this one's
really for adults.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
As far as requirements go, the only one that jumped out was Java
6 (Storybook won't work with Java 5 or earlier), which shouldn't be
much hassle.
</p><p>
Available from the Web site is what appears to be a distro-neutral
tarball. Download and extract the file, and open a terminal in the new
folder. Once there, enter the following command to run it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./storybook.sh
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Although I can't really give you a whole rundown on how to use
Storybook (that would require an article all its own), I at least
can introduce you to the main elements and highlight the coolest parts of
the program. Thankfully, the Web site has a very good tutorial, so have
a gander if you want to explore things further.
</p><p>
When you first enter the program, it prompts you for a project title.
Once you're past that, you'll be in the main screen where you can start
exploring. The largest part of the window is called the Chronological
View, which shows your scenes in chronological order (as this project
is still new, this window essentially will empty for the meantime).
</p><p>
To the right, in the top section, is the Object Tree. This shows
all the objects involved in this story thus far (such as characters,
scenes, locations and so on) in a hierarchical order. In the bottom
section is the Quick Info area, which pretty much does what it
says&mdash;provides info for 
each object you're looking at in the upper pane (the
Object Tree).
</p><p>
As for actually taking your first steps in Storybook, you need to
begin with new characters, scenes and so on. The toolbar at the top
with the icons will be your best friend here. The first icon is Open
(ignore for now), but continuing right are New Scene, New Chapter,
New Character and New Location. Each of those has very well thought-out dialog screens that link to other sections of the program.
</p><p>
For instance, the New Scene dialog allows you to link individual
or multiple characters to a scene, as well as individual or multiple
locations. The New Location dialog lets you be very detailed, giving you the
chance to assign a name, address, city and country to this location,
as well as a large description box to flesh out as many details about
this place as possible.
</p><p>
However, it's the New Character dialog screen that's particularly well
thought out. Each character can be assigned everything from first and last
names, abbreviations, gender, birthdays, date of death and occupation. They
even can be assigned a color. But, the most important feature is defining
whether they are a Central Character or a Minor Character, which then
affects the rest of the information throughout Storybook&mdash;masterful.
</p><p>
But what is the point of all this categorization, you may ask? Well,
it allows you to see patterns in your story and give it structure much
earlier in the process than a bare-bones, traditional pen-and-paper
approach would allow. Are you overusing a character? Have you broken a
piece of continuity somewhere or perhaps lost or missed out on some
vital context to the story? Storybook likely will show it long before
you see it yourself.
