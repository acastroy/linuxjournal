<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #195, July 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
More and more progress continues to be made on eradicating the <span   class="bold"><b>big
kernel lock</b></span> (BKL). We've now reached the stage where only relatively
few parts of the kernel still depend on the BKL. <span   class="bold"><b>Arnd
Bergmann</b></span>, who's
been maintaining his own source tree specifically targeting the BKL,
recently announced that his own work, and the contributions of lots of
other folks, had removed the BKL from the entire core kernel, and it
was now possible to build a kernel that had no instance of the BKL at
all. There still are some high-profile drivers that rely on the BKL
though (for example, USB and VFAT), as well as a lot of more obscure
drivers. Arnd also acknowledges that some of his BKL-removal patches may
be superseded by other people's efforts in a particular area. For
example, he took the BKL out of the <span   class="bold"><b>TTY
layer</b></span>, but <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span> has been
planning to do work on the TTY layer himself that probably would go
into the official tree instead of Arnd's work. But, the upshot of all
this is that the kernel is likely to become much more friendly to
threaded applications in the fairly near future.
</p><p>
With the modern proliferation of virtual systems like <span   class="bold"><b>VMware</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>Xen</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>KVM</b></span>, people want to write code that supports their particular
virtualization implementation within the host system. The result can
be some duplicated features, and potentially an approach that favors
the person's own preferred virtualization system over the generic
services the kernel is supposed to provide. That seems to have
happened recently, when VMware submitted some more work on its <span   class="bold"><b>balloon
driver</b></span>. A balloon driver allows memory allocation to fluctuate, so the
virtual system can release memory back to the host system, and then
claim more memory later, at need. It's a polite way to be
a virtualization system.
</p><p>
In this case, however, <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span> pointed out that an even more
polite approach would be to extend the memory handling abilities the
kernel already possesses. The code to handle system hibernation seemed
to him like a natural starting point for that approach. The only
drawback is that none of the virtual system developers had considered
that possibility, so it would mean backtracking their plans. But, it
seems like either that, or some similar extension of existing
functionality, will be the new direction, at least for balloon drivers.
</p><p>
One of the most interesting aspects of kernel development is the
balance struck between letting people contribute in the best way
they can and keeping a rein on the messiness that can creep into a
project when a lot of people are all pounding on it together. Recently,
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> caught <span   class="bold"><b>Phillip Lougher</b></span> copying some ugliness from
include/linux/mm.h into other include files needed for <span   class="bold"><b>SquashFS</b></span>.
Phillip knew there was a problem with that ugliness, but he'd cleaned
it up as much as he could, and any further effort would involve a
major detour from his SquashFS work. And anyway, the mess already
was in the code, so it didn't seem like such a high priority to him.
</p><p>
But, Linus adamantly refused to let the ugliness propagate further into
the code. He wasn't blaming Phillip for it, but he asked Phillip to
work on cleaning it up more, and asked <span   class="bold"><b>H. Peter
Anvin</b></span> to get into it
with him. The end result was a delay in accepting the SquashFS
changes and a bit of a detour for Phillip, but the work was at least
relevant to what Phillip wanted to do, and it was going to have a
fairly large impact on the cleanliness of this part of the kernel.

<h2 class="title">Wi-Fi on the Command Line</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #195, July 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
More people than ever are using wireless networks as their primary networking
medium. Great programs are available under X11 that give users a graphical
interface to their wireless cards. Both GNOME and KDE include network management
utilities, and a desktop-environment-agnostic utility called wicd 
also offers great functionality. But, what if you aren't running X11
and want to manage your wireless card? I don't cover how to 
install and activate your card here (for that, take a look at projects like madwifi
or ndiswrapper). I assume your card is installed and
configured properly, and that it is called wlan0. Most of the utilities mentioned
below need to talk directly to your wireless card (or at least the card driver),
so they need to be run with root privileges (just remember to use sudo).
</p><p>
The first step is to see what wireless networks are available in your area.
A utility called iwlist provides all sorts of information about your wireless
environment.
To scan your environment for available networks, do the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo iwlist wlan0 scan
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll see output resembling:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Cell 01 - Address: 00:11:22:33:44:55
          ESSID:"network-essid"
          Mode:Master
          Channel:11
          Frequency:2.462 GHz (Channel 11)
          Quality=100/100  Signal level:-47dBm  Noise level=-100dBm
          Encryption key:off
          .
          .
          .
</pre>
</p><p>
The details (address and essid) have been changed to protect the guilty. Also,
the ... represents extra output that may or may not be available, depending on your
hardware. You will get a separate cell entry for each access point within your
wireless card's range. For each access point, you can find the hardware
address, the essid and the channel on which it's operating. Also, you can learn
in what mode the access point is operating (whether master or ad hoc). Usually,
you will be most interested in the essid and what encryption is being
used.
</p><p>
Once you know what's available in your immediate environment,
configure your wireless card to use one of these access points
using the iwconfig utility to set the parameters for your wireless card. First,
set the essid, which identifies the network
access point you want:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid network-essid
</pre>
</p><p>
Depending on your card and its driver, you may have the option to set the essid
to the special value &ldquo;any&rdquo;. In this case, your card will pick the first
available access point. This is called promiscuous mode.
</p><p>
You also may need to set the mode to be used by your wireless card. This
depends on your network topology. You may have a central access point to which all of
the other devices connect, or you may have an ad hoc wireless network, where
all of the devices communicate as peers. You may want to have your computer act
as an access point. If so, you can set the mode to master using iwconfig. Or,
you simply may want to sniff what's happening around you. You can do
so by setting the mode to monitor and passively monitor all packets on the
frequency to which your card is set. You can set the frequency, or channel, by
running: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo iwconfig wlan0 freq 2.422G
</pre>
</p><p>
Or by running:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo iwconfig wlan0 channel 3
</pre>
</p><p>
You can set other parameters, but you should consider doing so only if you
have a really good reason. One option is the sensitivity threshold,
which defines how sensitive the card is to noise and signal strength, and you can set
the behavior of the retry mechanism for the wireless card. You may need to play
with this in very noisy environments. Set the maximum number of retries
with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo iwconfig wlan0 retry 16
</pre>
</p><p>
Or, set the maximum lifetime to keep retrying to 300 milliseconds with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo iwconfig wlan0 retry lifetime 300m
</pre>
</p><p>
In a very noisy environment, you also may need to play with packet fragmentation.
If entire packets can't make it from point to point without corruption, your
wireless card may have to break down packets into smaller chunks to 
avoid this. You can tell the card what to use as a maximum fragment size with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo iwconfig wlan0 frag 512
</pre>
</p><p>
This value can be anything less than the size of a packet. Some cards may not
apply these settings changes immediately. In that case,
run this command to flush all pending changes to the card and apply them:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo iwconfig wlan0 commit
</pre>
</p><p>
Two other useful commands are iwspy and iwpriv. If your card
supports it, you can collect wireless statistics by using:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo iwspy wlan0
</pre>
</p><p>
The second command gives you access to optional parameters for your particular
card. iwconfig is used for the generic options available. If you run it without
any parameters (<tt  >sudo iwpriv wlan0</tt>),
it lists all available options for the card. If no extra options exist,
you will see output like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
wlan0      no private ioctls
</pre>
</p><p>
To set one of these private options, run:


<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo iwpriv wlan0 private-command [private parameters]
</pre>
</p><p>
Now that your card is configured and connected to the wireless network,
you need to configure your networking options to use it. If you are
using DHCP on the network, you simply can run <tt  >dhclient</tt> to query the DHCP server
and get your IP address and other network settings. If you want to set these
options manually, use the ifconfig command (see the man page for more
information).

Linux continues to make headway in embedded devices, but for many
devices, it's just too heavy, and out of the box, it doesn't have
real-time support.

</p><p>
NuttX is a Real Time Operating System (RTOS) for small- to
moderate-size embedded systems.
It strives to be standards-compliant (POSIX and ANSI)
to the fullest extent possible for a deeply embedded environment.
NuttX is fully preemptible and includes a filesystem, C library, networking
and USB device support.
</p><p>
NuttX has been ported to numerous platforms/architectures ranging
from small 8-bit systems, such as the 8052 and the M68HC12, to larger
32-bit systems, such as the ARM Cortex-M3.
NuttX can be built with Linux and with Cygwin.
Depending on the options that are enabled, NuttX can be squished
down to around 20K or so.
Around 50K gives you room for a full-featured build.
</p><p>
NuttX was first released in 2007 and is actively developed.
It has had 49 releases since then and currently is at version 5.2.
NuttX is hosted on SourceForge at <a href="http://nuttx.sourceforge.net" target="_self">nuttx.sourceforge.net</a>
and
is licensed under a BSD license.

Sure, it was a cheesy 1980s movie, but more important, I'd like to focus
on the &ldquo;Repo&rdquo; part of it. As Linux users, software repositories are
second nature to us. For new users, however, that's not the case.

</p><p>
Take my father for instance. (Hi Dad!) He recently started using Linux on
his desktop machine, and once he was comfortable with the base install,
he wanted to try some other applications. As a longtime Windows
user, he called me to ask where a person goes to download software,
specifically Amarok. The concept of preloaded software repositories
was foreign to him, but I hope a rather exciting one once I explained it.
</p><p>
We often tout security, stability and freedom when we talk about
why Linux is so great. It's funny that the little things we take for
granted, things like &ldquo;convenience&rdquo;, already are built in to our favorite
operating system. I rambled on-line about this as well, and because my
space here is limited, feel free to add your two cents on our Web site:

<h2 class="title">Tablets, the New Netbooks</h2>

Tablet computers aren't new, just like tiny-form-factor computers
weren't new. Much like with the Netbook craze, the new tablet computing
craze has much to do with money and less to do with innovation.
Don't get me wrong. I think we'll see tons of innovation, but it
will be driven by consumers' pocketbooks (and their willingness to
open them) as opposed to some amazing new concept in computer design.

</p><p>
I certainly thought Netbooks were the perfect place for Linux to gain
a stronghold. Sadly, poor implementation by vendors and lack of a
standard desktop caused Linux to be the ugly alternative to Windows&mdash;something that should make us all shudder. Maybe, just
maybe, tablets will be our second chance.
</p><p>
Certainly, Apple's iPad has made a huge jump start into the hearts of spendy
Americans. This time around, however, the Linux community has something
we didn't have before: Android. Love it or hate it, Google has
managed to provide a rather standard platform that is designed to work
on mobile devices&mdash;and tablets!
</p><p>
So, to all my fellow Netbook owners who bought Netbooks just because
they looked cool, let's buy tablets! I don't really care which one,
but please, buy one that runs Linux.

<h2 class="title">Dear Canonical, I Can Haz Ubuntu One Source?</h2>

I love Dropbox (<a href="http://www.dropbox.com" target="_self">www.dropbox.com</a>) and use it on all my
computers, so I was
excited to see Canonical do something similar with its Ubuntu
One program. That excitement was quick to dwindle, however, when I
realized that although the client software is completely open source, the
server bits are not. Those of us running a huge network of computers
can't set up our own Ubuntu One server internally, <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span>
we can't hope
for the community to add support for other operating systems.

</p><p>
Ultimately, I wish Dropbox would become open source. That would not only
give us cross-platform support, but also remove the &ldquo;Ubuntu&rdquo; slant
that Canonical's product currently sports. My suspicion, however,
is that sooner or later, Google will realize Dropbox is the Gdrive
it has never had&mdash;and buy it. Although that would be really cool,
and more people would adopt the already-amazing Dropbox, it also
would mean no chance of Dropbox coming to a Linux server any time soon.
</p><p>
So again, Canonical, please open the source to Ubuntu One. You 
still can offer your cloud solution, but we also can make our own little
clouds in-house. Who knows, maybe the community will add features and
functionality that you'll want to adopt yourself. We'll be happy
to share back!

This month, I'd like to take the time to acknowledge the many people
involved with Drupal, the open-source Web project that powers
LinuxJournal.com. Although most of the core project is the work of a
small group of developers whose thousands of contributions are the
driving force behind Drupal's evolution, there are thousands of people
contributing code and modules to the community. These contributions
are what allow me to produce LinuxJournal.com without a large Web
team, and I am extremely grateful for them. Although I frequently cite
Drupal's flexibility and power as the reason I am able to remain a
one-person team, this is absurdly misleading. I am a one-person team
with a support system of thousands, and I also can credit Addison
Berry of Lullabot with getting me through many tough spots throughout
the past year.
</p><p>
I believe Drupal is the best Web platform around, but I also believe
that is a result of having the best Web community around. I am thrilled to
be a small part of it.
</p><p>
With sites like WhiteHouse.gov adopting Drupal, this is an exciting
time to be a Drupaler, and I encourage others to use it and get
involved. Thank the community that makes your own work better, and
don't forget to make your own contributions.
