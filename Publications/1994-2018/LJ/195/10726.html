Enterprise and open source&mdash;are they peanut butter and jelly, working
well together for a better world, or are they oil and water, meeting but
never coming together? In this article, I explore the challenges
of adopting open source in the enterprise. I look at the technical
issues, the business challenges and the political hurdles.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x170c580.0x18042a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
There is an old Chinese curse, &ldquo;may you live in interesting
times.&rdquo; Of
course, we all want to live in interesting times, but sometimes the
interesting part can be a bit much. The enterprise is an interesting
place. On the one hand, real enterprises have technology budgets that are
quite large, sometimes even running into billions of dollars. Much of
that budget is for labour, meaning that a successful enterprise technology
person can make very good money, while learning a lot on the way. Although
your typical tech shop may have a few servers and program in, say, Ruby,
with an HTML front end backed by MySQL, in an enterprise, you are likely
to encounter, and learn, every technology out there. If you like Ruby,
it is there; Java, most certainly; .NET, that too. If your preferences
run to infrastructure, you are likely to find everything from Windows
servers to Linux to UNIX variants to mainframes to the unexpected.
As recently as 2001, I worked as head of enterprise management at a place that had
a massive farm of DOS 3.1 PCs; those were &ldquo;interesting times&rdquo;.
</p><p>
On the other hand, enterprises don't start or end with cool technology,
and they are there to serve a business purpose. The most famous
illustration of this is the Nine-Layer OSI Model by the legendary
Evi Nemeth.

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10726f1.large.jpg"><img src="10726f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Sure, you may have the best solution to a problem, but in an enterprise,
you need to get the budget approved&mdash;on a multiyear cycle, of
course&mdash;and then you likely need to go before some sort of capital expenditure
(CapEx) or major expenditure review (MER) committee. Everyone there
views your request as competing with their priorities for 1) budget
allocation, because even a $1-billion IT budget is still finite, and 2) recognition
and promotion, because after all, they want you to succeed, but they
want their own projects to succeed even more. Finally, enterprises have
legitimate business support needs that may or may not be resolved by
your open-source solution.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x170c580.0x18047d0"></a>
Start with the Technical</h2></div></div><p>
At base, everyone interested in open source is interested in technology,
so let's address the technical challenges first. As you may have
noticed, enterprises spend a <span   class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span>
of money. Unsurprisingly, to quote Willie Sutton who used to rob
banks because &ldquo;that's where the money is&rdquo;, many commercial technology
businesses build products to focus primarily on the enterprise and solve
its unique problems, and they have very large sales and marketing budgets to
sell them. On the other hand, open-source products often are built,
at least initially, to solve very specific problems.
</p><p>
Thus, before advocating for open source, we need to understand if
the open-source solution solves the problem as well as the commercial
solution, given the entire requirements set. This includes not just the
immediate technical problem, such as &ldquo;serve up a Web page&rdquo;, but also the
management challenges that can be unique to an enterprise, such as &ldquo;replicate
in real-time across 15 databases in ten countries around the world,
while instantly alerting to any degradation and providing service-level agreement
(SLA) reporting&rdquo;. In many cases, open source has indeed developed to
the point where it truly can compete on a technical requirements level
with commercial products. In other cases, it is not yet sufficiently evolved,
but it may be some day. And in some cases, it is literally impossible to solve
the problem with open source. Let's examine two extreme examples.
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Web servers: the dominant Web server for many years, of course, has
been Apache. Although various competitors nip at its feet, such as IIS for
Windows or nginx for sheer performance, Apache remains dominant for both
intranet and Internet Web serving. In 2010, it is not hard to make the
argument to adopt Apache for a Web server solution in the enterprise. It
is mature, established, lots of well-known companies bet the
business on it, and it has the various controls, hooks, logging and
security that an enterprise demands. It is important to remember, however,
that only a few years ago, Apache was <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> sufficient,
and other commercial variants arose to fill in the gap, such as Apache
Stronghold. The combination of a mature product, a complete enterprise-ready
feature set and broad enterprise adoption make open-source Apache a
selection as valid as any commercial solution.
</p></li><li><p>
Network infrastructure: in the old days, when we had to decide whether to
route mail via UUCP or SMTP, we built our own firewalls. Routers 
simply were dedicated servers with multiple network interface cards (NICs)
on which we ran software to route the traffic. Over time, however,
the proliferation of networks and the demand for traffic-routing
capacity and intelligent control exceeded the capabilities of these
homegrown solutions. Special companies were formed to create specialized
networking hardware. The most famous, of course, is Cisco.
Although a small organization can make do with a simple router,
or even a dedicated box with a few NIC cards running m0n0wall, such
a solution is highly unlikely to work in a large enterprise. There,
the complexity, traffic demands and management requirements, as well
as a three-tier architecture (core, distribution and access layers)
can be done far more cost effectively, and in some cases, only with a
hardware solution. Clearly, open source is not about to run enterprise
networks. Having said that, it is not impossible that a split could
occur. Currently, enterprise network equipment manufacturers provide
both the hardware and software to manage routing, some of which may
be based on open source, such as Cisco ASA 8.x. It is possible that in the
near future, a pure-hardware networking equipment manufacturer could
be formed that would sell the hardware only, while software is provided
via an open-source solution, in a manner similar to current servers.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The important takeaway from evaluating any technology is that it
has to solve the immediate problem, such as serving Web pages, but also
have the features required for an enterprise, such as management, logging
and security. Rarely does it matter that the open-source product may
be better or that you want to support the community that brought us
Linux/Apache/whatever. For adoption in the enterprise, the rule remains,
as it should anywhere, first solve the actual problem and everything
related it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x170c580.0x1804d50"></a>
Move to the Business</h2></div></div><p>
In addition to solving technical problems, some of which are specific
to an enterprise, there are unique enterprise business requirements as
well. In a small IT environment or Web startup, no one wants a problem or
outage any more than in an enterprise. However, the technical tolerance
may be greater in a smaller environment, and it often is acceptable
that the trade-offs require the lone in-house expert (that would be
you) to &ldquo;take care of the problem&rdquo; in an emergency; often that is
the actual crisis plan. In an enterprise, with postmortems, roles
and responsibilities, and sometimes &ldquo;pin the blame on the
donkey&rdquo;, a
support plan of &ldquo;I will deal with it and work with on-line fora when
it breaks&rdquo; will not go over very well. The cost of error or failure
is at least proportional and often even exponential to the size of
the IT budget. 
</p><p>
These challenges create a minor requirement known as
a service-level agreement (SLA). IT promises its customers, whether
internal or external, certain service levels. In order to meet those
levels, there needs to be a predictable and reliable point of service
for every element of technology. For HP servers, there is a service
contract and spares; for routers, it is Cisco support or a partner; for
open source, it is ... ? In many cases, the product is stable enough or
distributed enough not to matter. In other cases, it matters greatly.
&ldquo;If it
breaks, who will fix it?&rdquo; is likely the number one question CIOs will
ask. They are not being difficult; they simply are doing their jobs,
determining whether they can meet SLAs and what will be the
true <span   class="emphasis"><em>fully</em></span> loaded cost of your open-source adventure.
</p><p>
In that respect, one of the more interesting business ideas in the
last decade is Red Hat. Its products are almost entirely open-source
products that can be downloaded for free from elsewhere. However,
it sells versions with full support. Essentially, Red Hat has decoupled
product development from product support. There is nothing particularly
special about Sun that allows it and only it to support Solaris
(at least since Solaris was made open source). Anyone with sufficient expertise can do so.
Recognizing that truth is the key to providing support for open-source products, exactly as
Red Hat has done for Linux. It sold more than a half-billion dollars in support subscriptions in
2009 for products that it, by and large, did not develop.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x170c580.0x1805118"></a>
Don't Discount Politics</h2></div></div><p>
Politics is the bane of every technologist's
existence. Politics
is about the subtle art of power interplays, personalities and
compromise. Technology, on the other hand, is about science, the truth and
the correct way. For a technologist, proving your point through tests and
scientific answers is the right way to go, but this path only antagonizes
outsiders. For politics does not care about the right answer, but about
the one that meets people's needs, rational and emotional. The solution
may very well not be the best one. It may not even really solve the
technical problem, but it is the one adopted nonetheless.
</p><p>
Around six years ago, I was exploring solutions to a particular problem
at a very large enterprise (around 100,000 employees). There were several
solutions, but the one I was advocating was open source. The other leading
candidate was proprietary. I had a very good relationship with the firm's
attorney, with whom I discussed the issue. &ldquo;Let's say the product fails
spectacularly&rdquo;, she said, &ldquo;and we lose $10MM in business because of
it, who do we come after? Who do we blame?&rdquo; From her perspective, an
attorney who is focused on the firm's legal needs, this is a perfectly
valid reason to go for closed source, backed by a large company. From my
perspective, I far preferred to go with the solution that would not only
cost far less, but also would provide better performance, thus reducing the
probability and expected cost of failure, let alone spectacular failure.
</p><p>
As an aside, it is also important to note that my
perspective could be difficult for her politically. If we focus solely
on reducing the probability and expected cost of failure, and accept
damages due to failure as an unfortunate cost of doing business, then
the legal department's value is concomitantly reduced. If she has any
influence over the final decision, and she did, these issues, seemingly
irrelevant to most technologists, must be taken into account. In this
case, I actually did win her over by pointing to the End-User License
Agreement (EULA). Like most such EULAs, there was a very strong limitation
of liability. For example, if you read the EULA to Microsoft Windows XP
Professional Edition, it clearly states that your Exclusive Remedy is
limited to either replacement of the defective software or possibly refund
of the cost of the software itself. If $10,000 in software causes $10MM
in damage, the most you can get back is $10,000 (maybe). I pointed out
that the legal department had <span   class="emphasis"><em>already</em></span> been rendered irrelevant for this software,
and not by me. Thus, the choice of solution would neither
reduce their position, nor strengthen someone (me) who had reduced that
positioning already.
</p><p>
Politics is the art of recognizing who wins and who loses with each
decision. Understand the relationships, the power plays, who has the
backing of the vendor you are explicitly discarding, who controls the
budgets, and you will be in a better position to pick your battles and
win them.

Tying It All Together</h2></div></div><p>
Open source has had huge amounts of successful adoption in the enterprise:
Linux, Apache, Xen, Perl, PHP, Java and the list goes on. Open source
also has had failures, either failure to launch (where it does not
get adopted) or explosion on the launchpad (where it is adopted and
fails). When looking to adopt an open-source solution in an enterprise,
it is important to remember the entire nine-layer model and answer three
questions: 
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Does it meet all of the technical requirements, including
those that are unique to running any technology in an enterprise?
</p></li><li><p>
Does it have sufficient support and maturity to meet the business
requirements of the enterprise? 
</p></li><li><p>
Can I move it through the process
while taking into account the politics inherent in any enterprise?
</p></li></ol></div><p>
If the answer to all three is positive, you have a good situation
for promoting adoption of an open-source solution.
