Stressed budgets and the high demand for Web applications
have made efficiency in the data center priority number one, creating the
need for inexpensive load balancing, application balancing and SSL-acceleration products. Does Coyote Point have what it takes to succeed
in the enterprise?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd3a580.0xe32408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Thanks to the low cost of open-source solutions and the falling prices of
hardware, network managers are finding it easier than ever to build out
networks and grow the capabilities of the data center. Network managers
quickly can meet the increasing demands of Web services, remote access,
VPNs and many other services by provisioning new inexpensive servers
with open-source software, which has fueled the exponential growth of
server clusters and Web applications. However, many network managers
are discovering that just throwing additional servers into the mix is an
inefficient way to balance loads across server farms. High server demand
can create a cascade effect across the servers, with a services request
sent to the primary server and moving on to the next server only after
the primary server has become saturated.
</p><p>
What's more, server virtualization solutions magnify the
problem. Virtualization makes it even easier and quicker to build out
multiserver solutions, yet virtualized servers still rely on that
same round-robin approach to meet high demand. That proves to be very
inefficient and a waste of processor cycles, and it negates most energy
savings offered by virtualization.
</p><p>
Many data-center administrators have turned to third-party products to
help mitigate those load-related inefficiencies, creating a healthy market
of load-balancing and traffic-acceleration solutions. Numerous products,
ranging from open-source software to hardware appliances that cost tens
of thousands of dollars, are all fighting for market share and promise
to be the best way to manage loads across servers and sites. However,
traffic-balancing products are not created equally and selecting the
correct load balancer can be fraught with uncertainty.
</p><p>
Coyote Point Systems entered the fray more than 15 years ago, with the ideology
that network traffic management was the key to maximizing bandwidth and
services availability to endpoints. Contrary to what other vendors were
doing in the 1990s, Coyote Point chose to go the route of building traffic
management capabilities into an appliance. The goal was to replace bulky
software solutions with an easy-to-manage device.
</p><p>
Although Coyote Point was a pioneer in the world of traffic-shaping
and load-balancing appliances, other companies, such as F5 Networks,
Barracuda Networks and Cisco also have focused on providing hardware-based load-balancing solutions, creating a crowded field of contenders,
where each vendor is looking to tout specialized capabilities to become
the appliance of choice.
</p><p>
Coyote Point has chosen to up the ante with the launch of a new series of
load-balancing appliances, which are virtual server-aware. What's more,
the company is looking to shift the focus from layer 4 load balancing
to application load balancing, where the appliance is aware of payload
as well as raw traffic. Coyote Point's application load-balancing
appliances can shape traffic and efficiently distribute loads across
multiple servers, even if those servers are virtual in nature. The growth
of virtualization solutions in the data center has made it critical for
traffic-shaping and load-balancing appliances to integrate with virtual
server solutions.
</p><p>
Coyote Point offers four different appliances. Those four appliances
differ based upon design traffic load and sub-features, yet all share
the same management console and basic feature set.

Application Load Balancing&mdash;the Coyote Point Way</h2></div></div><p>
I tested the E650GX (V8.6) load-balancing appliance for ease of use,
feature set, performance and suitability to task. I found that the device
is very simple to install; the physical portion of the installation
consists of plugging in the device and routing the appropriate Ethernet
cables to the unit. The E650GX is Coyote Point's top-of-the-line appliance
and sports 22 Gigabit Ethernet interfaces for connecting server clusters.

</p></div></div><p>
I spent more time figuring out my cabling than I did configuring the
device. Making sure your cabling goes to the appropriate servers is one of
the most important steps for deploying a Coyote Point appliance. You have
to be certain that you are plugging your server farm in to a load-balancing
port on the device. In complex environments, it is easy to forget that
a particular network segment is plugged in to a different router or
switch from what you originally thought. However, on smaller networks, you
simply can plug in the connection from your firewall to the external port
on the E650GX and then plug each segment of the LAN in to the internal
ports on the device. All ports on the E650GX are Gigabit Ethernet and
support full duplex operation. That means it is very unlikely the
device will introduce any bottlenecks into the LAN or WAN connections,
and none were detected during performance testing.
</p><p>
I found the rest of the setup process plug-and-play easy. After I
connected all the cables, I was able to access the E650GX's management
console using a Web browser. The management console is based on AJAX
technologies, creating a rich user interface, which is easy to navigate
and sports context-sensitive help. The interface was designed using the
Dojo toolkit, a JavaScript development toolset, which helps give
the management interface a professional look and feel.
</p><p>
The E650GX works pretty well right out of the box. All you need to do to
start load balancing is to set up some basic parameters. One of the first
steps to complete is the definition of your server clusters. For example,
if you have nine servers running a Web application, you would plug each
of those servers into an internal port on the E650GX appliance. The
next step consists of defining your server clusters. For example, you
may want to divide those nine servers into three clusters. That proves
very easy to do and easy to modify, if you need to change anything. All
clusters are defined logically, allowing a great deal of flexibility.
</p><p>
I found that the E650GX offers many options when it comes to load
balancing. You can use &ldquo;Match Rules and Custom Load Balancing
Policies&rdquo;
to build policies based upon layer 4 requests, layer 7 requests or
even create custom policies using Boolean logic. The layer 4 policies
offer basic load-balancing capabilities, based on parameters, such
as least connections, fastest response, adaptive and round-robin,
as well as an agent-based algorithm that is accurate if the agent is
run on each server. Layer 7 policies actually look at the content of
the traffic to determine how to load balance it. For example, certain
protocols or applications can be used to trigger a load-balancing policy
to route traffic to a particular cluster. Policies based on Boolean
logic take into account particular requests, based on a series of
administrator-defined events. Those policies can be used to reroute
traffic if a server fails to respond (failover routing) or to route based
on a schedule.
</p><p>
Once you have defined your clusters, you then can define rules to
handle traffic flow and load-balancing decisions. Coyote Point calls
those definitions Smart Events. The rules are based on a number of
parameters, such as server load, traffic type, server weighting and
connection persistence. The underlying technology that allows the E650GX
to make traffic-routing decisions is very complex. However, the E650GX
does an excellent job of hiding that complexity by using rule-creation
wizards and a commonsense procedural layout to make rule definition
very easy. That ease of configuration is rarely found in software-only
load-balancing solutions and allows even newbie network administrators
to set up basic load balancing with the E650GX.
</p><p>
I found that one of the most impressive features of the E650GX was
the unit's ability to work with VMware's vSphere products. That brings
application load balancing and traffic shaping to the world of virtual
servers. Coyote Point has built support for VMware's APIs, allowing
the E650GX to judge the load on a virtual server, then route requests
bases on virtual loads and administrator-defined load-balancing
policies. What's more, Coyote Point has included support for IPMI-capable
servers. The Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) is a
specification that allows third-party products to power on and power
off servers, as well as remotely execute other commands. Simply put, you
can define a policy that automatically turns on a server when traffic
loads hit a certain level, and then shut off that server once traffic
load drops.
</p><p>
I also found it very easy to segment LANs using the product's VLAN
capabilities. Administrators define VLANs based on IP address segments,
and the unit's built-in routing capabilities keep traffic isolated on
a VLAN for local requests. That can help reduce latency and speed up
requests by keeping the appropriate traffic on the same logical segment.
</p><p>
Ease of use permeates the interface, making it simple to set up many, if
not all of the unit's capabilities. You also will find that ease of use
present in the device's dashboards and reporting menus. The dashboards
offer a quick snapshot of how the device is performing and what traffic
is flowing across the device. Reports offer a historical reference of
many monitored parameters and can be useful for fine-tuning the unit.
</p><p>
Although the E650GX's primary focus is on application load balancing,
the unit also includes other features that help speed up network
access and reduce latency. Those features include SSL acceleration, HTTP
compression and global/geographic load balancing. SSL acceleration helps
reduce the latency found in HTTPS requests by offloading the packet
encryption on to the device. HTTP compression helps reduce latency by
compressing and optimizing HTTP requests, while global/geographic load
balancing can be used to balance traffic across geographical clusters,
placing requests on servers that are closest to the user, as far as
latency and bandwidth are concerned.
</p><p>
Administrators supporting e-commerce solutions will appreciate
the E650GX's ability to deliver persistent connections. E-commerce
transactions rely on a reliable connection between the client PC and
the server providing the transaction&mdash;if either endpoint loses track
of each other or is routed incorrectly, the e-commerce transaction will
fail. The E650GX solves that problem by creating a persistent connection
between the client PC and the server using cookies, which are inserted
into the HTTP returned to the client. That ensures the client will return
to the same server in the cluster.
</p><p>
The E650GX supports an active/passive failover model for sites that
need guaranteed uptime. Failover works by transferring the Equalizer
configuration to a backup device (which can be a lower-end model in the
Coyote Point family), so that persistent client/server connections are
maintained even when the primary unit fails.
</p><p>
Coyote Point has re-invented the idea of load balancing by shifting
traffic shaping from basic layer 4 algorithms to layer 7, application-aware calculations. That approach has created a new market segment
called application traffic shaping. Coyote Point also bundles in other
advanced capabilities, ranging from SSL acceleration to VLAN definition to
VMware vSphere support, making the device a complete traffic-acceleration
solution. Coyote Point is very adept at providing an acceleration solution
for most any server environment that can benefit from clustering and
traffic management. The top-of-the-line E650GX has an MSRP of $14,395 and
comes with one year of support included. Although $15K may seem like
a big chunk of change, Coyote Point's price is less than half of what
some larger competitors charge.

Performance Tests</b></p><p>
Performance was tested using a Spirent Avalanche 2900 configured to
generate traffic load on the E650GX. The goal of the performance
testing was to rate layer 7 HTTP transactions per second, layer 7
HTTPS throughput, layer 4 maximum concurrent connections and layer
4 connections per second. Those metrics are a good indicator of the
processing power of the device, as well as the overall capacity of
the device.
