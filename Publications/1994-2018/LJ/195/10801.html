The Linux Box's Enkive</h2></div></div><p>
Former President Nixon would have balked at Enkive, a new open-source e-mail
archiving and retrieval application from The Linux Box. That's because
Enkive captures e-mail messages as they arrive or are sent to ensure they
are retained before a worker can delete them in an e-mail client. This
feature helps organizations address the issues of compliance with laws and
regulations governing communications, as well as litigation support. It
permits recovery of e-mail in full support of an organization's retention
policies. In addition, storage costs are reduced by eliminating the
capture of redundant messages and attachments.

RackForce's ddsCloud Enterprise</h2></div></div><p>
The team at RackForce has announced availability of ddsCloud Enterprise, an
enterprise-level hosted private cloud solution. RackForce describes
ddsCloud Enterprise as a fully virtualized network, storage and compute
capacity in an on-demand model that utilizes best-in-class technologies
from Cisco, IBM, Microsoft and VMware. Built on RackForce's new
state-of-the-art GigaCenter infrastructure, the firm says the results are
&ldquo;unprecedented scalability, flexibility and greenness&rdquo;. ddsCloud
Enterprise leverages virtualization and unified fabric to combine
computing, network and storage into one seamless system. When compared with
previous computing models, RackForce asserts that it has seen deployment times
reduced by 85%, customer costs by up to 30% and a carbon footprint merely
1/50th the size of other cloud offerings located in conventional North
American data centers.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>Lucene in Action</em></span>, 2nd Ed. (Manning)</h2></div></div><p>
The editorial duo of Erik Hatcher and Otis
Gospodnetic has updated the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Lucene in Action</em></span> from Manning
Publications to a new 2nd edition. The 500-pager is touted as the
definitive guide to Lucene, an open-source, highly scalable, super-fast
search engine that developers can conveniently integrate into
applications. Since the first edition, Lucene has grown from a
nice-to-have feature into an indispensable part of most enterprise apps.
The book explores how to index documents; introduces searching, sorting
and filtering; and covers the numerous changes to Lucene since the first
edition. All source code has been updated to current Lucene 2.3 APIs.

Howard Davies and Beatrice Bressan's <span   class="emphasis"><em>A History of International Research
Networking</em></span> (Wiley)</h2></div></div><p>
Publisher Wiley calls <span   class="emphasis"><em>A History of International Research
Networking</em></span>
&ldquo;the first book written and edited by the people who developed the
Internet&rdquo;, and it covers the history of creating universal protocols and a
global data transfer network. Editors Howard Davies and Beatrice Bressan,
two veterans of the CERN particle physics research lab, are two of many
insiders who contribute with perspectives never before published on the
historic, technical development of today's indispensable Internet.

cPacket's cVu320G Network Appliance</h2></div></div><p>
The company cPacket is now marketing the cVu320G network appliance, a
solution for data centers, service providers and telecommunications that
enables on-demand capacity management, resource allocation and real-time
troubleshooting of bursts and spikes. The cVu320G provides complete packet
inspection filtering, flexible traffic aggregation, selective duplication
and flow-based load balancing, as well as granular, wire-speed performance
monitoring for 32 10-Gigabit links. cPacket's rationale for the
application is threefold: first, today's data centers struggle with
the growing stampede to 10 Gigabit and the increasing virtualization of
platforms and services; second, monitoring tools have not kept pace with
these developments, and, as a consequence, data centers are being
overwhelmed with huge volumes of complex traffic, which they no longer have
the visibility to control; and third, the consequences include intermittent
and frequent congestion, performance degradation and major service
disruptions to end users that are becoming increasingly common. The
solution is based on cPacket's unique, 20-Gigabit &ldquo;complete
packet inspection&rdquo; chips and Marvell's 10-Gigabit Prestera switch.

Napatech's NT20E2 Network Adapters</h2></div></div><p>
With the introduction of the NT20E2 Capture adapter and NT20E2 In-line
adapter products, Napatech recently unveiled what it calls &ldquo;the world's
first 2x10 Gbps Intelligent Real-time Network Analysis adapters&rdquo;.
Napatech has positioned the NT20E2 In-line for applications that require
both capture and transmit in real time, such as intrusion prevention
systems and policy enforcement applications operating at 10Gbps
line-speed. The former is complemented by the NT20E2 Capture adapter,
which provides full 20Gbps packet capture throughput over the PCI-Express
Gen 2 bus. The NT20E2 is drop-in-compatible with existing NT20E cards and
is supported by the same driver software as other Napatech network
adapters on Linux, FreeBSD and Windows.
