through my bookcases at home and at work and counted 19 different
O'Reilly books that I've purchased with my own hard-earned cash. I
refer to them almost daily.</p><p>I have one of the major commercial technical publishing
packages available to me at work. I have a copy of Microsoft Word
for Windows at home. I like their WYSIWYG look and feel and I like
their intrinsic (to me at least) ease of use.</p><p>I'm admittedly not a big TeX fan at all; and I even
participate quite a bit in the Linux DOC Project, which uses LaTeX
as its document mark-up language of choice.</p><p>OK, call me a Linux heretic.</p><p>I was looking at this book as an opportunity to learn about
all the little gotchas that just aren't made visible except by oral
tradition from guru to wanna-be. Maybe after reading the book and
trying some things, I'll be less TeX challenged.
Naaaaahhhh...</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Making TeX Work</em></span> is a book that somehow
disappoints me. The book follows the normal exceptionally high
quality O'Reilly &amp; Associates standards for organization,
format, binding, and appearance. There's 469 pages simply
chock-full of information regarding TeX and associated utilities. I
just never figured out why a generic Linux user needs to buy
it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x244c580.0x2544a80"></a>Stated Goal of the Book</h2></div></div><p>The Summer 1994 'ora.com' catalog/magazine from O'Reilly
&amp; Associates has an article on this book that describes it as
&ldquo;a complete reference to this complex typesetting system&rdquo;. It also
states:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;We didn't want to do the same kind of book so
many other people had written; describing the TeX language itself
and how you can use it to write your documents in one of the many
flavors of TeX macro languages... instead of writing a book on TeX,
the text processor, we'd write a book on the entire TeX
system.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Cool&mdash;a book on how to put all the pieces together and make a
document happen...</p><p>Later in the article, they mention that:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;In addition to the basic TeX program itself, you
need many other tools to write even a moderately complete TeX
document. You need to understand how TeX uses macro packages and
format files, fonts, pictures, figures, and a host of utilities...
&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Hey wait a minute. I'm getting this feeling it won't have
hands-on examples...</p><p>&ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Making TeX Work</em></span> guides you through this
maze of tools and tells you how you can obtain them...&rdquo;</p><p>Danger Will Robinson! Sounds like a how to find TeX sources
FAQ...</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x244c580.0x2544ef8"></a>1. An Introduction to TeX</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>The Big Picture</b></span> describes
what TeX is and what its goals are. It describes a little about how
TeX formats pages to look nice, about the differences between text
formatting, word processing and desktop publishing, and describes
the underlying guts of how TeX does its magic. It's ugly in there,
kiddies...</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Editing</b></span> briefly describes
some of the usual editors that have varying abilities to provide a
good environment for writing TeX documents.</p><p>This chapter disappointed me somewhat as I was looking for
more information regarding exactly how to do something in typical
editors. I was hoping that they'd pick an editor (even [ugh...]
Emacs) and give some real details regarding how to hook in and use
the editor to efficiently write TeX documents.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Running TeX</b></span> describes how to
execute the program and deal with some of the most common errors in
the documents.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Macro Packages</b></span> describes
some of the different formats such as TeX, LaTeX, and TeXinfo as
well as some of the more obscure special purpose formats such as
MusicTeX. While I found them interesting, there is probably nothing
here that you can't find out about elsewhere on Usenet.</p><p>There were some comments about how to do TeX in color and how
to print 'em on a black and white printer that I found rather
interesting.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x244c580.0x2545318"></a>2. Elements of a Complex Document</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Fonts</b></span> describes in laborious
detail more than any sane person would want to know about font
selection and generation. While it's a nice amount of background
information, it sure scared the heck out of me, and I'm probably a
typical member of the book's target audience.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Pictures and Figures</b></span> talks a
little about the fact that if you try hard enough, you can draw
pictures in TeX. It also gives a few examples about how to include
external images in your document.</p><p>One nice addition is a description of some of the many image
generation, viewer, editor, and manipulation programs commonly
available such as xv and ImageMagick. People who plan to provide
WorldWideWeb pages with embedded graphics might be interested in
this chapter even if TeX and friends scare you off.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>International Considerations</b></span>
describes the issues (and tools to deal with them) involved in
writing nonEnglish documents in TeX.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Printing</b></span> talks about
utilities that generate the appropriate fonts to be able to print
what you can preview.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Previewing</b></span> describes some of
the various viewers for MS-Windows, X, DOS (non-Windows), and Unix
terminals.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Online Documentation</b></span> talks
about how to make your TeX documentation available online in some
of the more common formats such as TeXinfo, HTML, or ASCII.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Introducing METAFONT</b></span>
describes the mechanics of building non-standard fonts. Again, I
wonder whether this issue isn't far beyond the probable ability (or
interest) of the book's target audience.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bibliographies, Indexes, and
Glossaries</b></span> talks about how to use BibTeX to automate
citations of references into a bibliography and also about many of
the utilities available to automate the creation and manipulation
of a bibliography database. It also describes how to construct an
index and glossary by annotating your TeX documents.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x244c580.0x25459a0"></a>3. A Tools Overview</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Non-commercial Environments</b></span>
discusses free and shareware TeX systems.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Commercial Environments</b></span>
talks about commercial versions.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>TeX on the Macintosh</b></span>
describes utilities that are Mac-specific. I don't know why it
seemed necessary to have a separate chapter in order to do
this.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>TeX Utilities</b></span> talks about
many of the commonly available TeX utilities available on the CTAN
archives.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x244c580.0x293df60"></a>Appendices</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Filename Extension Summary</b></span>
describes about 55 different filename extensions you may run across
that are related to TeX documents.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Font Samples</b></span> gives 45 pages
of font encoding tables and sample print from many of the METAFONT
fonts.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Resources</b></span> has 30 pages of
extremely brief listings regarding how to a variety of TeX-related
shells, editors, formats, and utilities.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Long Examples</b></span> has 45 pages
of scripts and other programs that are mentioned elsewhere in the
book. The book examples are also available electronically on
ftp.uu.net.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x244c580.0x293e2d0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Making TeX Work</em></span> has an incredible amount
of information in it that you may someday either need to find or
need to know. The problem is whether or not you need to spend
$30.00 to find this information.</p><p>If you're a System Administrator who wants to cut to the
chase regarding which public domain, commercial, or shareware
software to acquire for your MS-Windows PC or non-Linux (huh?) Unix
system then I'd give it a &ldquo;maybe&rdquo;. There's an enormous number of
skeletal descriptions of the hundreds of utilities that exist out
there on Internet or are available commercially, that the book
makes available for you in one nice neat place.</p><p>If you're more of a potential TeX user, I'm not so sure that
you'd be well served in buying this book. There's enough
description of the basic pdnciples that it serves as a good
starting point before you go and buy one of the more common TeX or
LaTeX books to give you the details regarding the language. On the
other hand, if you buy one of the other books you'd have that basic
information already.</p><p>I suppose if forced to make a recommendation, I'd recommend
that a Linux user who was looking to get into the world of TeX save
their pennies and:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>grab a recent copy of Slackware and install the
whole T series of kits. Voila! You're most of the way toward having
a functional TeX environment.</p></li><li><p>for how to do a single document, grab Matt Welsh's
&ldquo;linuxdoc-sgml&rdquo; package. Write your document in SGML. Use Matt's
package to convert it to LaTeX.</p></li><li><p>for how to write a big multi-part document, grab
the sources for one of the larger Linux DOC Project documents (like
Olaf Kirch's Network Administration Guide) and use it as an
example.</p></li><li><p>to get the list of Linux add-one for TeX document
production, use the WorldWideWeb index to the TeX CTAN archives by
getting into Mosaic on your local Internet site. See the comp. text
. tex Usenet group for the Web URL for the archives.</p></li></ul></div></div></div>
