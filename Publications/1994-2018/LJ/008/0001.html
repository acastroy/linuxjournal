    This popular DOS game is now available under Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26e6580.0x27de4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>I first heard of DOOM on Usenet, when
people would say &ldquo;I can't wait to get rid of DOS, but I still need
DOS to play DOOM.&rdquo; Wait no longer. I first played DOOM a few days
ago while running X on my Linux box.
</p><p>I was rather skeptical. I play very few computer games, and
not very often. When I do, they are usually games or clones of
games like Minesweeper, Tetris, Mahjongg, Golddig, and those rare
card games whose rules I am able to comprehend. I have never
particularly enjoyed adventure games of any sort, until I played
DOOM. Now my wife is worried I'm becoming addicted.</p><p>David Taylor (of Id, the company that wrote DOOM) recently
completed a port of DOOM to X under Linux, and asked me to review
it. I unpacked it (approximately 5MB worth), read the
<b  >README.linux</b> file (this is important if you have
never played the game, because it explains how to move, shoot, and
open doors, among other things), and played. And played. And
played.</p><p>The first thing I noticed was incredibly smooth scrolling.
And it's fast enough that I'm able to navigate well without feeling
disoriented. I've seen other adventure games played under DOS and
the scrolling has always been so rough that I could barely tell if
the character was turning right or left.</p><p>The second thing I noticed was that although it is a
shoot-'em-up game, it's not nearly as bloody as I had been lead to
believe. Anyone who has seen video arcade games or the evening TV
news should not be terribly bothered by the violence; you'll be too
busy learning the floor plan and how to navigate to notice the
blood, if I'm any judge.</p><p>DOOM is shareware. There are three adventures in the DOOM
family; the first one is free, no strings attached, no guilt
clauses telling you to register after 15 days or face legal action
or moral rot. However, if you like the first adventure, there is a
(reasonable) fee for purchasing the second and third adventures. I
personally prefer this to guiltware (what Linus calls
&ldquo;limited-trialperiod shareware&rdquo;).</p><p>My best recommendation for this product is that it is the
first adventure game that has held my interest for more than a few
minutes. My best recommendation against it is that you shouldn't
start to play it if you don't have lots of spare time to devote to
this game. You can blow away your friends by playing over the
network. (I haven't tested this, but it's probably well done if it
resembles the rest of the game.) Sound is supported if you have a
sound card. I don't have one so I can't comment on the sound
effects but I found the game perfectly playable with no
sound.</p><p>A few tips (some of which are in the README.linux file, but
you might miss them):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>If the screen is too dark to see easily, use the
F11 key to change the &ldquo;gamma correction&rdquo;. There are four levels of
gamma correction; press F11 repeatedly to cycle through them until
you find the one you like best.</p></li><li><p>Use a low-resolution video mode while playing DOOM.
640x480 looks good to me; DOOM uses a 320x200 window.</p></li><li><p>If you are using <span   class="emphasis"><em>fvwm</em></span> as your
window manager, you may have kept some default key settings that
move you around on the virtual desktop. Some of these keys may be
used as movement keys and, because of the combinations you can
have, almost any SHIFT-, CONTROL-, or ALT-ARROW key combination may
be used in DOOM. You might consider an alternate
<b  >.fvrmrc</b> file which does not set up these
keybindings.</p></li></ul></div><p><a href="0001s1.html" target="_self">DOOM Resources</a></p></div></div>
