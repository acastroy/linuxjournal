    Tcl and Tk will allow you to develop X Window System
    applications by writing simple, interpreted scripts. Learn
    how to unlock the power of X throught this unique
    programming paradigm.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae0580.0xbd85b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Anyone who has ever programmed X
applications through the Xlib interface, or the arcane X Toolkit
Intrinsics, or even Motif, knows that it is an experience that
cannot be fully appreciated without beating one's head against the
desk several times an hour. X programming at the C level can often
be quite complex, forcing the programmer to concentrate on messy
technical issues instead of simply building an interface. (Of
course, the tradeoff for this complexity is power and flexibility.)
That's why we have Tcl and Tk.
</p><p>Tcl (Tool Command Language) is an interpreted script language
not unlike C Shell or Perl. It provides all of the basic facilities
that you'd expect in such a language: variables, procedures, loops,
file I/O, and so forth; nothing too flashy or bizarre. If you've
ever written shell scripts you'll find Tcl quite easy to pick
up.</p><p>What makes Tcl special is that it can be embedded in other
applications. That is, the Tcl interpreter is a library of C
routines which you can call from your own program. For example;
let's say that you're writing a debugger, similar in nature to
gdb.You need routines to allow the user to enter commands (such as
&ldquo;step 10&rdquo; or &ldquo;breakpoint foot c:23&rdquo;) at a prompt. You'd also like
to allow the user to customize the debugging environment by writing
new command procedures or modifying state variables. A good way
tohandle the user interface would be with Tcl. You can link the Tcl
interpreter to your application, and all of the features of that
language will be available. The user's commands, entered at the
debugger prompt, would be executed by the Tcl interpreter, which
could call C functions that you have written. If the user needs to
customize aspects of the application, they can write Tcl scripts to
implement new commands, and so forth.</p><p>Tcl itself may not be very exciting, but coupled with Tk it
certainly is. Tk is a set of extensions to Tcl which implement
commands for writing X Window System applications. These commands
allow you to create buttons, scrollbars, text entry widgets, menus,
and much more; permitting you to write X applications as simple Tcl
scripts. With Tcl and Tk, there's little need to learn the C
library interface for X programming; Tcl and Tk provide access to
many X Window System facilities. In addition, you can embed Tcl and
Tk in your own applications, written in C, to greatly enhance the
power of this system.</p><p>This article is the first in a series on Tcl and Tk. In this
article, I'm going to describe how to write simple X programs as
Tcl/Tk scripts. Next month, I'm going to describe how to use the
Tcl/Tk interpreter in conjunction with programs written in C or
Perl.</p><p>The syntax of the Tcl language itself is relatively
straightforward and will be obvious to anyone who has programmed,
say, shell or Perl scripts. For this reason, I'm not going to spend
much time describing the syntax of the Tcl language itself; I'm
going to concentrate on the X- specific features of the Tk toolkit.
See the sidebar, &ldquo;Getting Tcl and Tk&rdquo;, for other sources of
information on Tcl.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae0580.0xbd8870"></a>Basic Tcl/Tk Scripts</h2></div></div><p>Let's dive right in with a simple Tcl/Tk program. The Tcl/Tk
interpreter is named wish (&ldquo;window shell&rdquo;). Assuming that you have
Tcl/Tk installed on your system, and X running, you should be able
to execute wish. You will be presented with a blank, rectangular
window, and a wish prompt.</p><p>You can type Tcl/Tk commands at this prompt, and the results
will be displayed in the wish window. For example, if you type:
button .b -text &ldquo;Hello, world!&rdquo; -command { exit } pack .b</p><p>the wish window should reduce to a single button containing
the string &ldquo;Hello, world!&rdquo;. (See Figure 1. next page ) Pressing
this button will cause the wish process to exit.</p><p>What did we just do? Every Tcl command begins with a command
name, followed by any arguments. button is a Tk command which
creates a button. In this case, we want the button to contain the
text &ldquo;Hello, world!&rdquo;, and we wish it to execute the Tcl exit
command when it is pressed. The first argument to button,&ldquo;.b&rdquo;, is
the name that we wish to give to the button widget.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="0008f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1
</p></div></div><p>(A widget is simply a graphical object, such as a button,
scrollbar, etc., which has certain visual and functional
properties. Tk supports many types of widgets, as we'll see.) We
can later refer to the button with this name.</p><p>The pack command is a geometry manager; it controls how
widgets are placed within the wish window. pack is a simple
geometry manager which &ldquo;packs&rdquo; (hence the name) widgets one at a
time next to each other. The widget is not made visible until it is
given a position with pack.</p><p>In this case, we wish to pack the button widget into the wish
window. pack can take a number of arguments to specify the position
of the widget relative to other widgets. However, here we have but
one widget, so the default behavior is acceptable.</p><p>Instead of typing commands to the wish process, you can write
scripts to be executed via wish. Here's a simple program which will
prompt you for a filename, and then start an xterm running vi to
edit the file.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/local/bin/wish -f
label .1 -text "Filename:"
entry .e -relief sunken -width 30 -textvariable\
  fname
pack .1 -side left
pack .e -side left -padx
lm -pady lm
bind .e &lt;Return&gt; {
exec xterm -e vi $fname
</pre><p>If you save the above in a file named
<b  >edit.tcl</b>, and then run it, you should be
presented with a window as in Figure 2. (This assumes, of course,
that you have wish installed in <b  >/usr/local/bin</b>.
Edit the pathname on the first line of the script if not.) Just as
with shell scripts, you will need to make the file executable
before running it.
</p><p>Let's walk through this script. The first line is a
<b  >label</b> command, which (as you might guess)
creates a label widget. A label contains only a static text string.
We name this widget <b  >.1</b> (more on widget naming
conventions later), and give it the text value &ldquo;Filename:&rdquo;.</p><p>The second line creates an entry widget, named
<b  >.e</b>. An entry widget is like a label, except that
it allows the user to edit the text. The <b  >-relief
sunken</b> option indicates that the widget should appear as
though it is &ldquo;recessed&rdquo; in the window, as you can see in Figure 2.
The <b  >-width</b> option sets the width of the entry
widget in characters, and the <b  >-textvariable</b>
option indicates that the value of the entry text should be stored
in the variable <b  >fname</b>.</p><p>The next two lines pack the label widget, followed by the
entry widget, into the wish window. In both cases we specify
<b  >-side left</b>, which indicates that the widgets
should be packed into the left side of the window, one after the
other. When packing the entry widget, we use the -padx and
<b  >-pady</b> options to leave a bit of &ldquo;paddingH (here,
one millimeter) around the sides of the widget. The Tcl
<b  >pack</b> man page describes these options in
detail.</p><p>The last three lines of our script use the
<b  >bind</b> command to create an event binding for our
entry widget. A binding allows you to execute a series of commands
when a certain event occurs in a widget; for example, a mouse
button click or a keypress. In this case, we wish to execute a
command whenever the RETURN key is pressed in the entry widget. The
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
exec xterm -e vi $fname
</pre><p>will start up an <b  >xterm</b> running
<b  >vi</b> on the filename entered by the user. Note the
use of the fname variable,</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="0008f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2
</p></div></div><p>which we associated with the entry widget on the second line
of the script. The variable name is prefixed with a dollar sign, to
refer to the value of fname itself. This is similar to the variable
syntax used in shell scripts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae0580.0xbd9790"></a>Using Braces</h2></div></div><p>One short note about Tcl syntax: Braces ( { ... }) are used
to group a set of Tcl commands together as a &rdquo;sub-script&ldquo;. The
commands contained within the braces are passed to the Td
interpreter without performing variable substitution. This is an
important concept to understand. Without the braces, the Tcl
interpreter would have attempted to substitute the value of the
variable <b  >fname</b> while interpreting the bind
command in the script. That is, when the <b  >bind</b>
command is first executed, the variable fname has no value. Without
braces, the Tcl interpreter would complain that fname is an unknown
variable. Using braces, however, we delay the interpretation of
<b  >$fname</b> until the event binding is actually
executed; in this case, when Return is pressed in the entry
widget.</p><p>Tk is a set of extensions to Tcl which implement commands...
permitting you to write X applications as simple Tcl
scripts.</p><p>Note that Tcl has several odd rules with respect to line
breaks. Tcl expects each command to consist of a single line; the
end of a line indicates the end of a command, unless the line ends
with a backslash, the same as in shell scripts. However, if a line
ends in an opening brace, Tcl understands that you are beginning a
sub-script, to be contained within braces, and continues to read
the script until a closing brace. For this reason, you can't
say:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bind .e &lt;Return&gt;
{
exec xterm -e vi $fname
{
</pre><p>Tcl will think that the bind command ends after the first
line, and complain that it needs a script to execute for the event
binding. Therefore, when using braces to encapsulate a sub-script,
be sure that the opening brace is at the end of the line beginning
the script.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae0580.0xbd9b00"></a>Naming Widgets</h2></div></div><p>In Tk, widgets are named in a hierarchial fashion. The
topmost &rdquo;shellH widget (that is, the main wish window) is named &ldquo; .
&rdquo; (dot). All widgets which are direct childIen of . are given names
beginning with ., such as <b  >.b,.entry,.leftscroll</b>,
and so forth. The widget name can be any alphanumeric string
beginning with a dot; you choose the widget name when you create
the widget, using commands such as button and label. Further
subwidgets are given names such as <b  >.foo.bar.bar</b>,
where each level is separated with a dot.</p><p><a href="0008l1.html" target="_self">Creating a Menu Bar
Listing</a></p><p>For example, you might have a menu bar widget named
<b  >.mbar</b>. It is a child, of course, of ., the main
window. Menu buttons contained within the menu bar might be named
<b  >.mbar.file,.mbar.options,</b> and so forth. That is,
the menu bar is a child of the main application window, and the
individual menu buttons are children of the menu bar. Arranging
widgets into a hierarchy allows you to group them together for
logical and visual purposes. I'll cover this in more detail
later.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae0580.0xfd20c0"></a>A Real Application</h2></div></div><p>In order to demonstrate the power of Tcl/Tk, I'm going to
present an actual application, written entirely as a Tcl/Tk script.
As I go along I will describe the syntax used and the features
available. You can use the Tcl/Tk man pages to fill in the
gaps.</p><p>This program is a simple drawing application, utilizing the
Tk canvas widget. The canvas is a simple graphics display widget
which will display various kinds of objects: rectangles, lines,
text, ovals, and so forth. What we're going to do is combine the
canvas widget with the user interface capabilities of Tk to allow
the user to draw objects using the mouse.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="0008f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3
</p></div></div><p>Figure 3 demonstrates what our application looks like when
used. The Color menu has been pulled down so that you can see the
various selections available.</p><p>The entire script, <b  >draw.tcl</b>, is given
here. Note that it's less than 200 lines long. This is amazingly
short for such a complicated X application involving menus, colors,
mouse input, and so forth. If you don't feel like entering this
entire script, the code is available via ftp from sunsite.unc.edu,
in the directory <b  >/pub/Linux/docs/LJ</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae0580.0xfd2538"></a>Creating the Menu Bar</h2></div></div><p>At first glance, this script might appear to be complicated.
There are a few rough spots, but the overall concepts presented
here are quite simple. Let's take a closer look at this program,
but let's start near the middle of the script, where we create the
frame widget:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
frame .mbar -relief groove -bd
pack .mbar -side top -expand yes -fill x
</pre><p>The frame command creates a frame widget, which is used to
group widgets together. The frame itself is usually invisible,
unless you specify that a border should be drawn around it.</p><p>Here we create a frame named <b  >.mbar</b>, and
specify that it should use the groove relief type. The &ldquo;relief&rdquo; of
a widget indicates what kind of 3D border should appear around the
widget. (Many options, such as <b  >-relief</b>,
<b  >bd</b>, <b  >-foreground</b>, and
<b  >-background</b> are supported by all widget types.)
The valid types for <b  >-relief</b> are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >raised</b>: Makes widget appear to
be raised on display.</p></li><li><p><b  >sunken</b>: Makes widget appear to
sink into display.</p></li><li><p><b  >ridge</b>: Draw raised ridge around
widget border.</p></li><li><p><b  >groove</b>: Draw sunken groove
around widget border.</p></li><li><p><b  >flat</b>: No relief; appear as if
flat.</p></li></ul></div><p>The <b  >-ted</b> option specifies the border width
to use for the widget (in this case, the width of the groove).
Here, we set the border width to 3 pixels.</p><p>Next, we pack <b  >.mbar</b> into the
<b  >wish</b> window. (By default, widgets are packed
into their direct parent. In this case, the parent of
<b  >.mbar</b> is ., the topmost window). The
<b  >-side</b> argument to pack indicates which side of
the parent we should pack <b  >.mbar</b> into. The
<b  >-expand</b> yes option indicates that the widget
should be given all of the extra space around it. Because we are
packing the widget into the top edge of the window, the
<b  >-expand</b> option gives the widget any extra
horizontal space to its left and right. The <b  >-fill
x</b> command causes the widget to grow until it fills this
space. Using -expand yes without <b  >-fill</b> would
give the widget the extra horizontal space, but the widget wouldn't
grow to fill that space. (If you're interested in how this works,
experiment with the pack command in various forms. Also, see the
pack man page or Ousterhout's book for more details.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae0580.0xfd32f8"></a>Creating Menus</h2></div></div><p>Having created and packed our menu bar, we create three menu
items, using the menubutton command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
menubutton .mbar.file -text "File" -underline 0 \
        -menu .mbar.file.menu
menubutton .mbar.obj -text "Object" -underline 0 \
        -menu .mbar.obj.menu
menubutton .mbar.color -text "Color" -underline 0 \
        -menu .mbar.color.menu
pack .mbar.file .mbar.obj .mbar.color -side left
</pre><p>A menubutton widget is simply a button which, when pressed,
causes a menu to appear below it. First, note that the menu buttons
are child widgets of the <b  >.mbar</b> widget. The
<b  >-text</b> option specifies the text to be displayed
within the menubutton, and the <b  >-underline</b> option
specifies the index of the letter in the menubutton text to
underline for keyboard shortcuts. In each case, we underline the
first letter of the string (see: Figure 3).</p><p>The <b  >-menu</b> option specifies the name of the
menu widget which should appear when the button is pressed. We
haven't created these widgets (<b  >.mbar.file.menu</b>,
and so on) yet, but do so immediately thereafter.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae0580.0xfd36c0"></a>Populating Menus</h2></div></div><p>First, we create the File men</p><pre     class="programlisting">
menu .mbar.file.menu
        .mbar.file.menu add command -label \
                "Save PostScript..." -command { get_ps
        .mbar.file.menu add command -label "Quit"
                -command { exit }
</pre><p>The menu command creates a menu widget with the given name.
(Note that the menu <b  >.mbar.file.menu</b> is a child
widget of the menubutton <b  >.mbar.file</b>). We then
add menu entries to this widget using the add menu widget command.
</p><p>Note that widget names themselves are commands. In general,
if we want to perform a function on a specific widget, we invoke it
as a command and use various widget subcommands. For example, to
modify the appearance of a widget, we can use the widget subcommand
<b  >configure</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;widget name&gt; configure [ &lt;options&gt; ... ]
</pre><p>For example,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
.mbar configure -background blue
</pre><p>would change the <b  >.mbar</b> widget background color
to blue. The widget man pages included with Tcl/Tk describe which
subcommands are available with each widget type.</p><p>In the example above, we use the menu subcommand add to add
entries to a menu. The syntax is</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;widget name&gt; add &lt;entry type&gt; [ &lt;options&gt; ... ]
</pre><p>where <b  >&lt;entry type&gt;</b> is one of:
</p><p><b  >command-</b>: Like a button widget, invokes a
Tcl command when selected. radictutton- A group of radicLutton
entries controls the value of a named variable. One radiobutton in
the group (that is, only one radiobutton associated with a given
variable) may be activated at any given time.</p><p><b  >checkbutton</b>: Similar to radicLutton. Will
toggle the value of a variable to either 0 (off) or 1 (on). Unlike
radiobuttons, how&ldquo; ever, checkbuttons are not mutually exclusive
with one another.</p><p><b  >cascade</b>: Allows you to &rdquo;cascade&ldquo; sub-menus
within the current menu.</p><p><b  >separator</b>: A nonfunctional menu separator,
used to visually divide menu entries.</p><p>The <b  >menu</b> man page describes these in more
detail. Within the File menu, we create two command entries. When
selected, each entry executes the command given by the
<b  >-command</b> argument. The <b  >-label</b>
argument, as you can guess, assigns a text label to the menu
entry.</p><p>The Object menu is similar in nature to the File menu, except
that it uses <b  >radiobutton</b> entries. These entries
are linked to the variable <b  >object_type</b>. When we
select the Ovals option from the menu,
<b  >object_type</b> is set to oval. Likewise, when
selecting Rectangles, the variable is set to rect. Because these
are radiobuttons, only one may be selected at a time. Later, we'll
see how the <b  >object_type</b> variable affects object
drawing within the canvas widget.</p><p>The Color menu is like the Object menu: We have four
radiobutton entries linked to the variable
<b  >thecolor</b>. We use the
<b  >-background</b> option with these entries to
visually depict the color being selected.</p><p>After creating the menus, we use the
<b  >tk_menubar</b> command to tell Tk that this is the
primary menu bar for our application. This enables keyboard
shortcuts for the menu bar. If you press Alt along with one of the
underlined letters in a menu title, that menu will be activated.
For example, pressing <b  >Alt-F</b> will activate the
File menu. The <b  >-underline</b> argument to the
menubutton command controls which letter activates which menu.
Pressing <b  >F10</b> activates the leftmost menu, and
you can use the arrow keys to move around.</p><p>The focus command is used to cause all keyboard events in the
application window to be received by the menu bar. Otherwise, the
mouse pointer would have to be within the menu bar for the keyboard
shortcut events to be received. This is yet another fine point
about X programming which you shouldn't concern yourself with at
this point.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae0580.0xee61c0"></a>Defining a Procedure</h2></div></div><p>The first menu entry on the File menu, &rdquo;Save PostScript...&ldquo;,
executes the command get_ps, which is a procedure which we have
defined earlier in the script. The proc command is used to define
procedures; the syntax is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
proc &lt;procedure name&gt; &lt;arguments&gt; &lt;body&gt;
</pre><p>where <b  >&lt;procedure name&gt;</b> is, of couse,
the name of the procedure to define,
<b  >&lt;arguments&gt;</b> is a bracketed list of
arguments to the procedure, and <b  >&lt;body&gt;</b> is
the script to execute when the procedure is called.
</p><p>Take a look at the <b  >get_ps</b> procedure. It
uses the canvas widget postscript subcommand, which saves a
PostScript image of the canvas widget to a file. This is a very
handy feature, which we can use to &rdquo;save&ldquo; our drawing (possibly to
print out or view with Ghostview).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae0580.0xee6530"></a>Creating a Dialog Box</h2></div></div><p>The <b  >get_ps</b> command displays a dialog box
asking for the name of the file to save, and two buttons, Okay and
Cancel (see Figure 4, page 28).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="0008f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4
</p></div></div><p>The dialog box, which is a separate window, is actually a
<b  >toplevel</b> widget. We use the
<b  >-class</b> option to toplevel to change the window
class; this has to do with the X resource database settings for the
new window (not an important detail here). We name our new
<b  >toplevel</b> widget <b  >.ask</b>, and use
the <b  >wm</b> (window manager) command to set the title
for the window.</p><p>Within the toplevel widget, we create two frames,
<b  >.ask.top</b> and <b  >.ask.bottom</b>.
These will serve to group widgets together. We wish to have a label
and a text entry widget in the top frame, and the two buttons in
the bottom frame. (This is for visual effect only: using frames is
a very good way to group widgets together when using pack).
Therefore, we create the frames using the frame command and pack
them into the toplevel task. Nothing new here.</p><p>Within the top frame, we create a label and an entry. This is
equivalent to our first example script,
<b  >edit.tcl</b>. Note that the label
(<b  >.ask.top.l</b>) and the entry
(<b  >.ask.top.e</b>) are children of the frame widget,
which is in turn a child of <b  >.ask</b>. Also, we bind
the Return key in the entry widget to execute the postscript
subcommand of the canvas widget, <b  >.c</b> (which we
will create later in the script), and destroy the
<b  >.ask</b> widget. This has the effect of &rdquo;popping
down&ldquo; the dialog box.</p><p>In the lower frame, we create two button widgets and bind
similar commands to them. This should be selfexplanatory. Finally,
we use the grab command. This causes mouse and keyboard events to
be confined to the dialog box window. Otherwise, you would be able
to continue drawing within the main application window while the
Save PostScnpt dialog box was active; we certainly wouldn't want
that.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae0580.0xee6e20"></a>The Canvas Widget and Event Bindings</h2></div></div><p>Having dealt with the menus, we are ready to tackle the
canvas widget, which will be used for drawing. First, we create the
widget and pack it into the application window. Next, we create two
event bindings within the canvas: one for
<b  >&lt;ButtonPress-1&gt;</b> (executed when mouse
button 1 is depressed) and one for
<b  >&lt;B1-Motion&gt;</b> (executed when the mouse is
moved while button 1 is pressed).</p><p>The event names used with bind are the standard X11 event
specifiers. These are described in any book on X11 programming (as
well as good X user guides). There are too many types of X events
to enumerate here; see the header file
<b  >/usr/include/X11/X.h</b> for a list of event
names.</p><p>When button 1 is depressed in the canvas widget, we wish to
start drawing an object of the type specified by the
<b  >object_type</b> variable, in the color
<b  >thecolor</b>. First, we set the global variables
<b  >orig_x</b> and <b  >orig_y</b> to the
original position of the mouse click; this defines the
upper-left-hand comer of the object to draw. As the comments say,
the pseudo-variables <b  >sx</b> and
<b  >sy</b> refer to the <b  >%x</b> and
<b  >%y</b> coordinates of the event.</p><p>Next, we use the canvas create subcommand to create an
object. The syntax is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;canvas name&gt; create `(type&gt; &lt;xl&gt; &lt;yl&gt; &lt;x2&gt;
&lt;y2&amp;gt: \
[ &lt;options&gt; ... ]
</pre><p>This will create an object of type
<b  >&lt;type&gt;</b> with upper-lefthand comer at
<b  >&lt;xl&gt;</b> ,<b  >&lt;yl&gt;</b> and
lower-right-hand corner at <b  >&lt;x2&gt;</b>,
<b  >&lt;y27gt;</b>. The valid object types are
<b  >arc</b>, <b  >bitmap</b>,
<b  >line</b>, <b  >oval</b>,
<b  >polygon</b>, <b  >rectangle</b>,
<b  >text</b>, and <b  >window</b>. The Tk
canvas man page describes them all.
</p><p>The canvas create subcommand returns a unique identifier
(just an integer) for the object just created. A Tcl/Tk command
contained within square brackets ( [ . . . ]) is used to run a
sub-script, the retum value of which will be substituted in its
place. We assign the retum value of the create subcommand to the
variable theitem. We will use this value, later, to resize the
object when the mouse is dragged.</p><p>The binding for <b  >&lt;B1-Motion&gt;</b> is very
similar. First, we delete the item with the identifier given by the
variable <b  >theitem</b>, and then re-create the item
with the new lower-right-hand comer defined by the current position
of the mouse. The original upper-left-hand corner has</p><p>been saved in the variables <b  >orig_x</b> and
<b  >orig_y</b>, and we re-use them here. We save the new
object identifier back in the <b  >theitem</b> variable.
What we have essentially done is deleted the current object, and
re-created it with a new size based on the mouse position during
the drag. The visual effect of this is that the item is resized
while we drag the mouse.</p><p>The last few lines of our script invoke the first entries in
the Object and Color menus. This enables the oval object type, and
the color of red, just as if we had selected these menu items with
the mouse. If we did not do this, no object type or color would be
selected when the application started. Of course, we could have set
the variables object_type and thecolorby hand; however, the
radiobutton entries in the menu would not be highlighted to
correspond with those variable settings. Using the menu item invoke
subcommand solves both problems at once.</p><p>There you have it! A complete X drawing application, complete
with colors, menus, and PostScript capabilities, all in a few
hundred lines of interpreted Tcl/Tk script.</p><p>Along with the man pages and the information in this article,
you should be ready to explore Tcl and Tk on your own.</p><p>As you can see, Tcl/Tk programming is easy; it's an ideal way
to write simple X applications, or add X frontends to your favorite
utilities. There's a complete text edit widget which will allow you
to interface with other textbased applications, as well. And Tcl/Tk
is extremely customizable; everything from the keyboard and mouse
widget bindings to the fonts and highlight colors can be
modified.</p><p>Writing entire applications as Tcl/Tk scripts may not suit
your needs, however. In next month's article, I'm going to descibe
how to use the Tcl/Tk interpreter, wish, as a &rdquo;server" for X
interface requests from a C or Perl program. (You can even draw
directly to Tk windows using lower-level Xlib function calls from
C.) This will allow you to write complicated X-based programs
without having to dabble in the Xt Intrinsics or Motif.</p><p>Happy hacking.</p></div></div>
