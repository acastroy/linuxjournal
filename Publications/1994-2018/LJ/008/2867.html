    Jamie Honan gives us a brief report on Linus' international
    visit, and the Australians' quest to impress Linus.

Linus to come and talk at their annual conference in Melbourne.
While here in Australia, he also traveled to Canberra, Sydney, and
Perth and talked at seminars organised by local Linux user
groups.</p><p>I helped organise events in Sydney. We scheduled only two
official events, which left Linus plenty of time to take in the
local sights.</p><p>The first official function was a talk, which went quite
well. Most of the 60 people who attended run Linux, and Linus was
surprised at the technical depth of the questions. Although he had
planned to talk for about an hour we went on for well over two. At
the end of the talk, Peter Chubb presented Linus with one of his
SLUG (Sydney Linux Users Group) tee-shirts. Quite leterally, this
tee-shirt has a picture of a slug on it. As I said at the time, how
could we give him anything that truly represented the gratitude we
felt?</p><p>The day after, we went for a picnic on Shark Island in the
harbour. It was also a success&mdash;the day was stunning and the
harbour was awash with sailboats flying their spinakers. Lots of
photos were taken; perhaps when they're developed some could be put
up for ftp, so those who didn't come can live it
vicariously.</p><p>On a personal level, Linus was an absolute delight to look
after.</p><p>One highlight: walking past the local bowling club and
explaining how the Australian variety of outdoor bowls is
played.</p><p>We had been trying to impress Linus with Sydney's highlights.
We all thought the opera house would do it. Linus would say, &ldquo;Well,
it's very nice, but I'm not really impressed.&rdquo; on it went, the
sunny harbour&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, it's very nice;&rdquo; how about holding the Koala
bear&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, just nice.&rdquo; After a while, it got to be a little
challenge, and we ribbed hime about his Northern European &ldquo;never
being too impressed&rdquo; attitude. But we finally gave up trying to
impress him, and took him to the handiest dive for a quick cheap
meal: a local RSL, or veterans association, club.</p><p>Just off the retaurant was the room which holds all the poker
machines (slot mahinces, or &ldquo;pokies&rdquo; in Aussie slang), and we had a
quick look inside: a ghaslty and garish collection of brighly lit
and noist machines. I was slightly embarrassed, after all the good
impressions we'd been trying to make, but Linux just smiled and
said, &ldquo;Now I really am impressed.&rdquo;</p><p>I know Linus had a good time. I just hope circumstances
permit him to come back before too long. There's an old fashioned
saying, and it really applies to Linus: &ldquo;You couldn't meet a nicer
bloke&rdquo;.</p></div></div>
