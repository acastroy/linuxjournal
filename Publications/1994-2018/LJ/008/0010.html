    Need to run multiple tasks but have only a standard dial-up
    connection to the host? Term may be the answer you have been
    looking for.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1df2580.0x1eea450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Term, originally developed by Michael
O'Reilly (michael@iinet.com.au), is a program that allows multiple,
concurrent connections over a serial line. Term allows almost all
&ldquo;standard&rdquo; TCP/IP applications to be used on a Unix system that is
connected by a serial connection to a networked Unix system. Unlike
other common serial protocols, such as SLIP and PPP, term does not
require non-user administrative maintenance, and requires no
modifications to the host kernel. This means that virtually any
user with a login shell on a dialup system can utilize network
utilities that were once limited to SLIP/PPP users.
</p><p>Unlike SLIP or PPP, your machine does not have its own IP
address. All incoming traffic must be addressed to your remote
host, and it will be directed to your local computer by
term.</p><p>Term essentially works by redirecting packets on your remote
host directly to your local Unix system. This allows any incoming
network packets to reach your computer by proxy, via your remote
dial-up computer. The same basic idea works for outgoing packets as
well: local sockets on your computer are redirected to your remote
host, and sent on their way to their actual network
destination.</p><p>The entire term package is a basic suite of utilities and
libraries that allow you to establish these network connections.
These utilities are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >term</b>:
This is the actual daemon that is run on both the remote and local
computers. This establishes the bridge that is needed to link your
computer to the remote host and the rest of the network.</p></li><li><p><b  >tredir</b>:
This is the most commonly used utility that comes with term. It
allows the user to manually redirect an outgoing or incoming port
for use with non term applications, for example redirecting the
SMTP (e-mail) port so that the user may send or receive
e-mail.</p></li><li><p><b  >tmon</b>:
This utility monitors and displays the incoming and outgoing
traffic over your serial line. Two bar graphs are displayed showing
the levels of traffic, updated each second. This allows you to
monitor just how much bandwidth you are using at any time while
using term.</p></li><li><p><b  >trsh</b>:
This utility allows you to quickly access your remote login shell,
much like rsh or rlogin would allow you to. This allows you to
perform routine network tasks from your account if needed.</p></li><li><p><b  >tupload</b>:
Much like <b  >sz</b>, this utility is used to transfer
files to or from your remote account, depending on which &ldquo;end&rdquo; of
the term-link it was executed from.</p></li><li><p><b  >txconn</b>:
When you need to display an X application remotely, or have one
displayed on your local screen, txconn establishes the needed
redirection to make this possible. (The same effect can be created
with tredir, as will be explained later.)</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Other
applications</b></span>: Recently, a flurry of activity has
resulted in a few more term clients such as
<b  >tudpredir</b>, a udp port redirector;
<b  >tdate</b>, which sets your computer's time by the
Network Time Protocol; and &ldquo;download, which reciprocates what
<b  >tupload</b> does.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1df2580.0x1eeaf50"></a>Configuring Term</h2></div></div><p>Before you can actually run term, you should run a utility
called <b  >linecheck</b> on the remote and local
computers.</p><p>Linecheck is used to check the &rdquo;transparency&ldquo; of the link, by
seeing which 8-bit characters are transmitted across the link. The
results of <b  >linecheck</b> are used to configure term
to operate correctly and optimally.</p><p>To run linecheck:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Using a communications program, log into your
account on the remote system and run:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
linecheck linecheck. log
</pre></li><li><p>Suspend your comm program (^Z under kermit),
otherwise it will steal characters from linecheck.</p></li><li><p>On the local system, run:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
linecheck linecheck.log &gt; /dev/modem &lt; /dev/modem
</pre></li></ul></div><p>After linecheck has completed its operation, examine the two
<b  >linecheck.log</b> files. At the bottom of these
files will be an indication of which characters you must escape in
your .termrc configuration file. The messages in
<b  >linecheck.log</b> give the characters (if any) that
need to be ignored on one end and escaped on the opposite end of
the link. For example, if my local results indicated that I should
escape 3 4 and 121, my resulting <b  >.termrc</b> files
would have something like this in them:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Local:
escape 34
escape 121
</pre><p>and my remote <b  >.termrc</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ignore 34
ignore 121
</pre><p>because I have to <span   class="emphasis"><em>ignore</em></span> escaped
characters on the other end.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1df2580.0x1eeb840"></a>Running Term</h2></div></div><p>Term is very flexible with many configuration options on the
command line as well as in the <b  >.termrc</b> file.
Running term is much like running
<b  >linecheck</b>:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Using a communications program, dial up your remote
account and log in</p></li><li><p>Start term from that account. A sample command line
might be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
term -l $HOME/tlog -s 38400 -c off -w
10      -t 150 -r
</pre><p>This command line indicates:</p></li><li><p>Set the log file to tlog in your home
directory</p></li><li><p>Set the line speed to 38400 bps</p></li><li><p>Turn off term's compression (presumably because
your modem does better compression)</p></li><li><p>Use a window setting of 10 (explained in the term
documentation)</p></li><li><p>Use a timeout of 150 (explained in the term
documentation)</p></li><li><p>Set this as the &rdquo;remote&ldquo; side</p></li><li><p>Shell back to your local computer, either by
suspending your terminal program, or using its built-in shell
features. For Kermit, use ctrl-Z, for xcomm use ctrl-a-x. (Check
your specific terminal program's own documentation.)</p></li><li><p>Initiate term on your local computer:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
term -c off -l $HOME/tlog -s 38400 -w 10 -t 150
&lt; /dev/modem &gt; /dev/modem &amp;
</pre></li></ul></div><p>The only difference in this case is the redirection to the
modem device and lack of the -r option.</p><p>It should be noted that all of the command-line arguments can
be placed in the . termrc file so you need only type term by itself
to initiate it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
.termrc:
compress off
speed 38400
window 10
timeout 150
</pre><p>Note that you will still need to put the redirection on the
command line.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1df2580.0x22e45e8"></a>Using the Standard Term Clients</h2></div></div><p>The standard term clients <b  >trsh</b>,
<b  >tredir</b>, <b  >tmon</b>, &rdquo;upload, and
txconn are relatively easy to use. The most commonly used utility
is <b  >trsh</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1df2580.0x22e4850"></a>Trsh</h2></div></div><p><b  >trsh</b> is used to access your remote account
as if you were using rlogin to access it. <b  >trsh</b>
can also act like <b  >rsh</b> and execute commands on
your remote host:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% trsh
Remote: term 2.0.4
tty /dev/ttyp4. exec /usr/local/bin/tcsh
foober : /home/ j oeuser%
% trsh -s uptime 1:15am up 20 days, 17:30,       3 users,        load
average:
1.00, 1.00, 1.00
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1df2580.0x22e4ab8"></a>Tredir</h2></div></div><p>The most utilitarian of the term clients, this command allows
you to manually redirect TCP/IP ports for use with term. For
example, to allow incoming telnet sessions to your home computer,
you need to redirect a port on the remote host to your own telnet
port, which is port <b  >23</b>. The common command
format of <b  >tredir</b> is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tredir [thiscomputer: ]port [thatcomputer: ]port
</pre><p>By default, the first port is the port on the machine you are
running the command on, the second port is the port value on the
other computer you are redirecting to.
</p><p>In this example, I want to redirect port
<b  >4000</b> to my own port
<b  >23</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
remotehost% tredir 4000 23
Redirecting 4000 to 23
remotehost% telnet localhost 4000
Trying . . . Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^] '
Linux 1.1.35 (linuxbox) (ttyp3)
linuxbox login:
</pre><p>Another example of use of tredir is to configure your system
to allow reading news via your network's NNTP news server. This
requires a tredir on the local side of term, instead of the remote:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
linuxbox% tredir 119 news. server.com: 119
Redirecting 119 to news.server.com:ll9
linuxhox% export NNTPSERVER=localhost
linuxbox96 trn
</pre><p>[normal trn session follows]</p><p>Notice that in this example the NNTPSERVER variable is set to
localhost. This is because the local 119 port has been redirected
to the real network NNTP server. So any connections to the
localhost NNTP port is redirected to the real one on the remote
computer. A direct connection to the actual NNTP server (setting
NNTPSERVER to news.server. com) would not be possible on a term
link, unlike SLIP/PPP which would allow this. tredir makes possible
the use of many applications that use standard TCP sockets, such as
sendmail, IRC, MUD's, MUCK's, and many other similar multi-user
games.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1df2580.0x22e4fe0"></a>Tupload</h2></div></div><p>This is the term equivalent of sz or other file
upload/download protocols. It allows the transfer of files from the
local machine to the remote, or vice-versa, depending on which end
the command is initiated. Commonly, the command line would look
like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
linuxtox% tupload foot tar. gz
</pre><p>Which would send a copy of the file foo.tar.gz to the remote
host. Some useful flags are illustrated below:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
linuxbox% tupload -vv -p -16 foo.tar.gz
Changing priority to -16
sending foo.tar.gz
30651 of 259727 (11%),
current CPS 3083. ETA:
76.8 TT: 84.2
</pre><p>The <b  >-vv</b> flag means give verbose messages on the
status of the upload, while <b  >-p</b> means change the
term priority of the upload. This prioritizing allows you to nice a
term process so it doesn't hog bandwidth from the other term
applications you may be running. This is useful for large
background transfers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1df2580.0x22e52f8"></a>Txconn</h2></div></div><p><b  >txconn</b> is designed to ease the redirection
of X applications from one host to another. If a user on computer2
wants to display an X application on your screen, you use txconn.
Like using tredir, any incoming connections must use your remost
host's name or IP address to connect to you.</p><p>Because X is outwardly different than normal TCP/IP clients,
it needs special handling for redirection. By itself, txconn uses
no command line arguments:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
remotehost% txconn
Xconn bound to screen 9
:9
</pre><p>This means that your home X display can be accessed from the
network as <b  >remotehost:9</b>, meaning root window 9
on the remotehost. If a user on computer2 wants to send his xclock
to your local display, he would type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
computer2% setenv DISPLAY
remotehost:9 computer2% xclock &amp;
</pre><p>After a few moments, the xclock he executed will appear on
your display.
</p><p>If you want to display an X application running on your
computer to computer2's display, you must use tredir. This is a bit
confusing.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
linuxbox% tredir 6004 computer2:6000
Redirecting 6004 to computer2:6000
linuxhox% export DISPLAY=localhost:4
linuxbox% xclock &amp;
</pre><p>This may look a bit odd, but what you are doing is
redirecting your display :4 (unused by you) to computer2's default
display of :0. Ports 6000-6100 represent displays :0 to :100. By
redirecting your own display :4 to his :0, any X application on
your local machine which uses display :4 will appear on computer2's
screen. It's a bit convoluted, but it works effectively.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1df2580.0x22e5770"></a>Other Term Clients</h2></div></div><p>Because of the nature of term, applications that work with
standard TCP/IP will not work without the use of tredir, and even
then, they may not always work. For example, it would be impossible
to use tredir for an application like NCSA Mosaic because it makes
so many different connections to different hosts and services.
Other applications, though they use a single network connection,
don't work because they use a secondary data port, such as
<b  >ftp</b> or IRC's DCC protocol. Applications such as
this require modification of the actual source code to utilize the
term socket. Most popular applications such as Mosaic, lynx, ftp,
ncftp and irc have already been modified for use with the term
protocol.</p><p>If you compile these applications yourself, they must be
linked with the term library, <b  >libtermnet.a</b> (This
library has replaced the old <b  >client.a</b> library.)
This library contains the needed instructions and symbols for using
the term socket.</p><p>New developments in term have made it extremely easy for
users to modify existing TCP/IP applications for use with term,
without the massive source code modifications that were once
required. By using drop-in replacements for common
socket/networking functions such as <b  >connect()</b>,
<b  >gethostbyname()</b>, and
<b  >send()</b>,you need only modify the Makenle of an
application to make it term-compliant. This drop-in replacement is
the <b  >libtermnet.a</b> library, and a header file
which translates standard networking calls into term-compliant
calls. One interesting note is that a termnet-linked binary also
works with normal TCP/IP, so if you ever change to SLIP or PPP in
the future, your term-compliant binaries will still work!</p><p>Only two elements are needed in the Makefile to make a
term-compliant binary. In the location where the
<b  >INCLUDES</b> are defined, you add:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
-include /usr/src/term200/termnet.h
</pre><p>adapting the path for your term source path, of course.
</p><p>And in the <b  >LIBS</b> or
<b  >LDFLAGS</b> section, you add:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
-L/usr/local/lib -ltermnet
</pre><p>If you have <b  >libtermnet.a</b> or the
<b  >libtermnet.so.2.0.*</b> shared library installed in
a common library path, <b  >-L/directory/path</b> isn't
needed.
</p><p>Hopefully, after adding these definitions, you end up with,`
fully term-compliant binary. There are still a few shortfalls, of
course. Many applications use non-standard socket calls, and
termnet cannot fully control things like that. Also, the newly
integrated (as I write) udp support in term is still very
rough.</p><p>Applications such as Chimera, lynx, xarchie, rsh/rlogin and
fsp are a few examples of successful tennnett~ng, and more are sure
to follow.</p><p>With the implementation of termnet, the days of manual
source-level hacking on most applications is over, and more and
more applications that were once too hard to hand-patch term
support into will be available to term users.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1df2580.0x22e60b8"></a>The Future of Term</h2></div></div><p>After <b  >term116</b>, the term development was
passed on to Bill Riemers (bcr@physics.purdue.edu). Major additions
to term have been introduced, such as udp support, which is getting
better and better, and shared libtermnet, which allows easy
upgrading of term versions without recompiling term-compliant
binaries every single time. The <b  >udp</b> support has
enabled such applications as ytalk, xarchie and fsp to Work through
term.</p><p>There are still a lot of things to complete and improve with
term, but it's a very successful and very useful tool for people
who don't have the resources to run full-blown SLIP or PPP. It is
very good, and can only get better.</p></div></div>
