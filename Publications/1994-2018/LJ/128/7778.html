Adding Clam Antivirus to Your Postfix Server</i></h3></div><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Mick Bauer</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #128, December 2004</div></div><div><p>
Keep vulnerable systems out of trouble with a layer of high-performance
protection on your Linux mail server.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18b4580.0x19ac348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The winner of <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s 2004 Editors' Choice Award for Security
Tool was ClamAV, a 100% free and open-source virus scanner that runs on
Linux but scans for viruses that affect a variety of platforms (see <i  >Linux Journal</i>, August 2004). As Reuven Lerner noted in the award article, &ldquo;ClamAV is giving the commercial
virus-checking programs a real run for their money.&rdquo;
</p><p>
In this month's column, I show you how to harness the power of ClamAV
on your Postfix e-mail gateway. Along the way, you also learn a few
things about Amavisd-new, a powerful e-mail-processing d&aelig;mon that serves
as a crucial conduit between e-mail servers, such as Postfix and
Sendmail,
and mail-scanning tools, such as ClamAV and SpamAssassin.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18b4580.0x19ac5b0"></a>
The Architecture</h2></div></div><p>
The scenario I'm about to describe by no means represents the only good
way to use ClamAV. But it's the scenario I personally have encountered
the most; it's certainly typical. Say we have an SMTP
gateway that receives all Internet e-mail destined for our organization,
and we want to configure that SMTP gateway to pre-filter that mail for
viruses (Figure 1). Our gateway can be configured to deliver mail to
local mailboxes, or it can relay everything to an internal mail
server. Everything that follows works the same regardless of the delivery method.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7778f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Our Example E-mail Architecture
</p></div></div><p>
In a high-volume setting, we could do all of our virus scanning on a
standalone scanning server rather than locally on the SMTP gateway; all
the tools described here work well that way. But for simplicity's sake
and because it's common practice, we're going to run our virus scanner
directly on the SMTP gateway.
</p><p>
We're going to use Postfix for our Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) because it is
popular, securable and can work well with ClamAV. But
Postfix can't interact directly with ClamAV, at least not reliably.
ClamAV isn't too good yet at dissecting actual e-mail messages, as
opposed to data streams. Therefore, we need to introduce a helper
d&aelig;mon called Amavisd-new.
</p><p>
Amavisd-new is another free and open-source tool, and its sole purpose
in life is to broker transactions between MTAs, such as Postfix and
Sendmail, and anti-virus and anti-spam utilities, such as ClamAV and
SpamAssassin. Among other things, Amavisd-new excels at converting MIME
e-mail attachments into conventional data files that scanners can
understand.
</p><p>
Amavisd-new's d&aelig;mon, amavisd, can communicate through a variety of
protocols, including the SMTP and LMTP e-mail protocols, and also through
UNIX sockets. Here, we configure amavisd to listen for e-mail by way of
SMTP on TCP port 10024, communicate with ClamAV by using ClamAV's local UNIX socket and
send e-mail and scanning-results back to Postfix on TCP port 10025.
Figure 2 illustrates how e-mail flows through our SMTP gateway.

Getting and Installing the Software</h2></div></div><p>
Both ClamAV and Amavisd-new are written in Perl and depend on
numerous Perl modules. Therefore, I recommend you find and use binary
packages of recent versions of these two tools for your distribution. You should
have a much easier time letting apt-get, Yum or up2date automatically handle
the dependencies that arise when trying to install everything manually.
</p><p>
The ClamAV Web site, besides being the home of the latest ClamAV
source code, has a page that lists sources of binary packages for ClamAV
for a variety of Linux distributions and other operating systems.
For Red Hat and Fedora users, Dag Wieers' page (see the on-line Resources)
provides Yum repositories and up2date sources containing
both ClamAV and Amavisd-new. The Amavisd-new Web site has links
to other sources of Amavisd-new packages, as well as the latest
Amavisd-new source code. ClamAV is now a standard package on Debian
beginning with the sarge release, and Amavisd-new is part of SuSE 9.1.
</p><p>
If you install either package from source code or from a standalone
package, as opposed to using Yum, up2date or apt-get, be sure to see
the Prerequisites section of Amavisd-new's INSTALL instructions (see Resources).
ClamAV's prerequisites aren't quite as well documented. When in doubt, it doesn't hurt to try
<tt  >rpm --test -iv clamav_packagename.rpm</tt> on your ClamAV RPM to see which
required packages your system is lacking.
</p><p>
Chances are your distribution provides packages for the various Perl
modules that ClamAV and Amavisd-new require. Any not provided can be
obtained from CPAN or from other third-party
sites that specialize in packaging software for your distribution.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18b4580.0x19ace48"></a>
Configuring ClamAV</h2></div></div><p>
Once you've installed ClamAV and Amavisd-new, you can configure
them. We start with ClamAV, the simpler of the two.
ClamAV's configuration file is /etc/clamav.conf. To configure ClamAV,
open this file with the text editor of your choice. Listing 1 shows the
parameters most people need to change from the defaults.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18b4580.0x19acf50"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. Non-Default Settings in /etc/clamav.conf</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Example
LogFile /var/log/clamd.log
LogFileMaxSize 5M
DatabaseDirectory /usr/share/clamav
LocalSocket /usr/share/clamav/clamd.sock
User clamav
</pre></div><p>
The first line seems innocent enough, but it's important that you comment it
out. If it isn't, clamd cannot run.
</p><p>
The two LogFile... settings are commented out by default. Uncomment
them to enable logging to the file of your choice and to
overwrite the file when it reaches the size specified in LogFileMaxSize.
</p><p>
DatabaseDirectory is crucial. This is where ClamAV keeps its
virus-signature databases&mdash;its brains, as it were. In the ClamAV RPM
I installed, the clamd d&aelig;mon was compiled
to use /usr/share/clamav for this setting, but the included sample
clamav.conf file showed a commented-out value of /var/lib/clamav, so
I uncommented this setting and changed it to /usr/share/clamav in order
to minimize confusion.
</p><p>
LocalSocket determines which socket file clamd uses to communicate
with the outside world, namely, Amavisd-new. If you use this setting,
which I recommend, be sure to leave the lines for TCPSocket and TCPAddr
commented out. On my Genco package, the default value for this path
for LocalSocket is /tmp/clamd, but /tmp is world-readable/writable. I
recommend you instead set this path to /usr/share/clamav/clamd.sock
and set the permissions on /usr/share/clamav to rwxrwx. In other words, remove
the read/write/execute bits for other.
</p><p>
The last setting in Listing 1, User, specifies the name
of the non-privileged user account clamd should run as after
initialization. clamd must be started as root, but if this parameter
is uncommented and set, clamd demotes itself after it's done
initializing.
</p><p>
This is all most of us need to set in /etc/clamav.conf. Before
you start clamd, however, make sure your system has an
account for clamav and the permissions on any path you set in
/etc/clamav.conf are set accordingly. It's also a good idea to use a
group, clamav, for this account. As we see in the next section,
this makes it easier to share certain resources between clamd and amavisd.
</p><p>
The /etc/passwd entry for clamav user account is:


<pre     class="programlisting">
clamav:x:52:52:ClamAV Daemon:/:/bin/false
</pre>
</p><p>
And, the /etc/group entry for clamav group account is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
clamav:x:52:
</pre>
</p><p>
Once clamd is configured, you can start it simply by entering the command
<tt  >clamd</tt>. If you installed ClamAV from a binary package, your system may
have an init script for clamd in /etc/init.d. If so, be sure to enable
it so clamd starts at boot time. Otherwise, you need to
create and enable your own startup script.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18b4580.0x19ad580"></a>
Configuring Amavisd-new</h2></div></div><p>
As with clamd, we need to edit only a single file, /etc/amavisd.conf, in
order to configure amavisd. However, we've got a little more work to do
here. Listing 2 shows the most important settings in my /etc/amavisd.conf
file.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18b4580.0x19ad6e0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

$log_level = 2;
$virus_admin               = "mick\@$mydomain";
$mailfrom_notify_admin     = "antivirus\@$mydomain";
$mailfrom_notify_spamadmin = "antivirus\@$mydomain";

  \&amp;ask_daemon, ["CONTSCAN {}\n", "/usr/share/clamav/clamd.sock"],
  qr/\bOK$/, qr/\bFOUND$/,
  qr/^.*?: (?!Infected Archive)(.*) FOUND$/ ],

</pre></div><p>
The first two settings in Listing 2, $daemon_user and $daemon_group,
specify the user and group amavisd should run as, amavis and clamav,
respectively. As I mentioned previously, I like to use a
common group for all of amavisd's and clamd's files, so it makes sense
to have amavisd run as that group too. The /etc/passwd entry for my
amavis account looks like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
amavis:x:53:52:Amavisd-new Daemon:/var/amavis:/bin/false
</pre>
</p><p>
$mydomain specifies your organization's name domain. $MYHOME, which should
be set to the same path as your amavis account's home directory, specifies
the root path to Amavisd-new's files, customarily /var/amavis. This
directory should be owned and writable only by root. $QUARANTINEDIR is
the path to the directory in which you want amavisd to dump quarantined
e-mail messages. This directory should be owned
by your amavis user account and writable only by it.
</p><p>
$db_home, which you may need to uncomment, specifies where amavisd
should keep its databases, such as include cached scan results, among other
things. $helpers_home specifies the directory in which you want amavisd to keep
its SpamAssassin settings and other miscellaneous things. $helpers_home
may be commented out by default. The directories specified by $db_home
and $helpers_home should be owned and writeable only by your amavis
user account.
</p><p>
$pid_file and $lock_file, also possibly commented out, can be used to
specify where amavisd writes its pidfile and lockfile, respectively.
</p><p>
$log_level specifies how verbose amavisd's log messages should be,
expressed as a number between 0 and 5, with 5 being the most verbose. The
default is 0, but I find 2 to be a much more useful setting that
nonetheless doesn't clutter my logfile. By default, amavisd sends its log
messages to the local syslog system under the mail facility. In other
words, your amavisd log messages should turn up in the same place as where your
Postfix messages are written.
</p><p>
The next four settings concern e-mail originated by amavisd when a virus
or spam message is detected. $virus_admin is the e-mail address to which
you'd like virus notifications sent. This must be a valid e-mail address;
update your local aliases file if the value you set here isn't yet. In
practice, this probably should be the e-mail address of you, the
system administrator.
</p><p>
It's also possible to configure amavisd to send notifications
to each message's intended recipient or to its sender, but most people
find this annoying, especially because the from addresses of spam and virus
e-mails nearly always are forged. Don't do that.
</p><p>
$mailfrom_notify_admin and $mailfrom_notify_spamadmin specify the
from address to use when amavisd sends virus or spam notifications,
respectively.
</p><p>
Finally, we come to amavisd.conf's real magic: the antivirus scanner
definition for ClamAV. In my default /etc/amavisd.conf file, this entire
section was commented out, so I first had to delete the initial #
on each line. You may or may not need to do this yourself.
</p><p>
You do, however, need to check the clamd socket path in this section. In
Listing 2, I've changed mine from the default of /var/run/clamav/clamd
to /usr/share/clamav/clamd.sock, the same path I defined in /etc/clamav.conf.
</p><p>
Once you've edited /etc/amavisd.conf and set the permissions on amavisd's
directories accordingly, you can start the d&aelig;mon by entering the command
<tt  >amavisd</tt> without arguments. As with clamd, you need to enable and
maybe even first create a startup script for amavisd so it starts at
boot time. I advise setting this up so that clamd starts first. That way,
by the time amavisd starts, clamd's socket already is in place.
</p><p>
Also, as with clamd, you should start amavisd as root. It demotes
itself to the user and group you specified in amavisd.conf.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18b4580.0x1da6068"></a>
Postfix Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Our ClamAV and Amavisd-new d&aelig;mons are configured and running. Only a
couple more tasks remain, configuring Postfix for content filtering
and updating ClamAV's virus databases.
</p><p>
Important note: the following assumes that Postfix already is
configured for and successfully performing its normal receiving/forwarding
duties.
</p><p>
First, open /etc/postfix/master.cf with your text editor of choice, and add
the lines in Listing 3 to the bottom of the file, if they aren't there
already.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18b4580.0x1da6220"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 3. Lines to Add to /etc/postfix/master.cf</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
smtp-amavis unix -     -      y      -      2  smtp
     -o smtp_data_done_timeout=1200
     -o disable_dns_lookups=yes

127.0.0.1:10025 inet n  -      n      -     -  smtpd
     -o content_filter=
     -o local_recipient_maps=

     -o smtpd_sender_restrictions=
     -o smtpd_recipient_restrictions=permit_mynetworks,
        &#8618;reject_unauth_destination
     -o mynetworks=127.0.0.0/8
     -o strict_rfc821_envelopes=yes
     -o smtpd_error_sleep_time=0
     -o smtpd_soft_error_limit=1001
     -o smtpd_hard_error_limit=1000
</pre></div><p>
The smtp-amavis section defines Postfix's outbound communications,
using the SMTP protocol, with amavisd. It corresponds to the following
line you should add or edit in /etc/postfix/main.cf:

<pre     class="programlisting">
content_filter = smtp-amavis:[127.0.0.1]:10024
</pre>
</p><p>
This line tells Postfix to send all incoming e-mail to 127.0.0.1, the local
system, on TCP port 10024, amavisd's default SMTP listening port, by using
the smtp-amavis interface we defined in master.cf. You can change
amavisd's listening port by editing the $inet_socket_port parameter in
/etc/amavisd.conf.
</p><p>
The second section in Listing 3 defines the inbound interface on which
Postfix should accept messages returned by amavisd. In other words,
Postfix listens on the local loopback IP 127.0.0.1 on TCP port 10025,
which are the address and port to which amavisd sends notifications and
forwarded messages by default. You can change amavisd's notification
and forwarding address and ports by editing the parameters $notify_method
and $forward_method parameters, respectively, in /etc/amavisd.conf.
After editing master.cf and main.cf, you need to restart or reload
Postfix.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18b4580.0x1da6590"></a>
Testing the System</h2></div></div><p>
Before we go any further, let's test the system. The simplest way to
test is to send yourself an e-mail message containing the following
string, which is not a real virus but a test string called the Eicar
Test Signature:


<pre     class="programlisting">
X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*
</pre>
</p><p>
If everything is working, amavisd sent an e-mail to the account you
specified in amavisd.conf's $virus_admin parameter, and the message
should be quarantined in the directory specified in amavisd.conf's
$QUARANTINEDIR parameter.
</p><p>
I highly recommend tailing your mail log while performing this test.
Type <tt  >tail -f /var/log/mail</tt>, and Postfix and amavisd
will log their actions there. In my own experience, this is the fastest way to
identify problems, especially if you increased amavisd's log-verbosity
as described earlier.
</p><p>
Also, be sure to do at least one test with clean e-mail to ensure
you haven't impaired Postfix's ability to receive and deliver
unfiltered mail.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18b4580.0x1da68a8"></a>
Updating ClamAV's Databases</h2></div></div><p>
There's only one thing left to do, but it's important: update ClamAV's
virus-signature databases and create a cron job to do so automatically
every day. ClamAV includes a utility called freshclam for this purpose.
</p><p>
Because using freshclam is the simplest task in this entire undertaking,
and because I'm basically out of space for now, I leave it to you
to explore the freshclam(1) and freshclam.conf(5) man pages. Suffice it
to say that in normal practice you use the command form <tt  >freshclam -l
/path/to/logfile</tt>, where /path/to/logfile specifies the file to which
you want freshclam to write its logs.
</p><p>
It's recommended that you run freshclam every couple of hours. The easiest
way to do this is by running freshclam in d&aelig;mon mode via the -d and
-c startup options. See the freshclam(1) man page for more information.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18b4580.0x1da6ab8"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
With that, you now should have a ClamAV-enabled SMTP gateway or at
least be started down the road towards one. If you're having problems, the
on-line Resources includes additional Postfix plus Amavisd-new
tutorials. Good luck!
