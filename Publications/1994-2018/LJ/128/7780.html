Like other rapidly growing sites, Technorati is
extending the LAMP suite with Memcached, the Spread
Toolkit and other independent spirits.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fa8580.0x20a0450"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Building infrastructure for a search engine like
Technorati's, which scours and archives the &ldquo;live&rdquo;
Web of RSS and similar feeds, is like building a
series of barns, each after the last one burns
down. When recounting the brief history of his
company, David Sifry usually says, &ldquo;Well, after
the first infrastructure fell down...and after the
second infrastructure fell down...and after the third
infrastructure fell down....&rdquo; No wonder he also says,
&ldquo;Scaling is everything.&rdquo; Instructive failure is a
less-glamorous description of trailblazing.
</p><p>
Technorati's trail started in David's basement,
on a server that Penguin Computing loaned to
David and me for a feature on blogs for the
March 2003 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. See &ldquo;Building with Blogs&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Technorati
Story&rdquo; in the on-line Resources. The service instantly was popular
and has continued to grow steadily. By the time
you read this, Technorati will be watching nearly
four-million syndicated sources, mostly Weblogs,
and well over a half-billion links. (Disclaimer:
I'm on Technorati's advisory board.)
Think of Technorati as a search engine for stuff that's too new for
Google&mdash;plus a platform for free and paid services based on the
company's growing archives and countless potential forms of derived data.
</p><p>
One can look at Technorati as another fast-scaling LAMP hack.
But when I talk to Technorati's techies,
it turns out some of the most interesting applications are from open-source suspects outside the familiar LAMP list of
Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, Perl, Python and PostgreSQL. I recently asked
the company's new VP of Engineering, Adam Hertz, who came over from
Ofoto in July 2004, to tell me more about one or two of those useful but
low-box-office tools. He immediately pointed to Memcached and handed
the explaining over to Ian Kallen, senior architect on his staff.
</p><p>
&ldquo;A lot of what we're doing has never been done before&rdquo;, Ian told me.
&ldquo;But a lot of the scaling problems we hit along the way
<span   class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> been
experienced before. And the result is open-source freeware, often very
robust, that eases exactly the pain we're experiencing.&rdquo; One such result
is Memcached, a distributed caching system developed by Danga
Interactive, the folks behind LiveJournal, which accounts for a very
large percentage of the blogs Technorati follows. Ian explains:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Lookup queries in a large data repository can be expensive. If
lookups are repeated at a rate near or less than the rate of change,
it makes sense to spare the application repeated round trips to
fetch the data. An obvious solution is to have the application
process keep lookup results in a cache. The downside is that caching
is typically resource consumptive; in a multiprocess application
such as a Web service, having each process (or thread) keep its own
cache reduces the cache efficiency and bloats the application
resource footprint. The solution to this is a shared cache.
</p><p>
High application availability requirements are typically met with
server redundancy. Now if each server instance has a cache of its
own, the cache efficiency reduction becomes as ridiculous as having
individual processes share a cache on a single host. The solution
there is a distributed cache and that's where Memcached comes in.
</p><p>
Listening on a network socket and utilizing very simple parameters
to instrument memory allocation, Memcached maintains an in-memory
dictionary of keys that is dynamically populated with values.
Technorati uses search parameters as keys and search results as
values. The payback comes when search results that are duplicative
of previously run queries return; they come back at least an order
of magnitude faster.
</p><p>
In addition to its speed and simplicity, Memcached's other principal
strength is its flexibility. It can store objects in language-native
serialization formats such as Perl's Storable or Java's
Serializable. Technorati uses PHP's native serialization to store
cache results. However, Memcached can store any bytes that can be
used interoperably; one cache client implemented in Java can
access and read a cached XML document stored by another client
written in Perl, Python or PHP. This can be a huge win for
heterogeneous development environments.
</p><p>
Application stabilization and performance optimization is a critical
concern for burgeoning data repositories such as Technorati's.
Caching isn't the only thing in the software toolbox. Application
architectures can still benefit or suffer from the quality of other
design decisions. However, the integration challenge posed by
Memcached is so low as to make it a primary consideration for data
retrieval acceleration.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
When I asked Adam again about other less-known tools that might be in
his box, he said the company also was about to use the Spread
Toolkit&mdash;a language-independent messaging system that allows updates, events and
information to flow through distributed systems. He explains:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
When a blog pings us, think of that as an event. Our spider
responds and goes and gets the new content. It then puts the
update on the message bus, so any application can see the message as
it goes by. Each subscriber&mdash;a Technorati application or
service&mdash;gets a chance to see every message that goes by. It can either
pick it up or pass on it. An application can say, &ldquo;hey, am I
interested in this update?&rdquo; This way, we reduce the internal query
load on the database, and we also make the applications more
real-time. This is called multicast. It's a service similar to what TIBCO
has been for financial systems.
</p><p>
For example, a blog post about a political book might be interesting
to Book Talk, News Talk and Politics Today.
Rather than having all three
applications querying the database to find relevant updates in the
last five minutes, that blog post would travel across the system and be
picked up by all three applications.
</p><p>
This not only speeds up performance for users and applications, but
opens lots of new service opportunities for users, outside
applications and services using the Technorati API.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Jonathan Stanton, one of Spread's creators at Johns Hopkins University,
added this:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Spread (also) provides fault-tolerant messaging. Meaning if some
machines that are part of a Spread group crash or are partitioned
from the others, Spread guarantees that all the machines that are
still connected will see the same set of messages. This strong
semantic group messaging can be used to build replicated databases
(one open-source project building a replicated database using Spread
is Postgres-R) and guarantee consistency in clustered caching
systems (like Technorati's).
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Five interesting things here. First, note where
the Technorati <span   class="emphasis"><em>doesn't</em></span> look for answers. The old
industrial model assumes that you obtain the expertise
you need internally (from a responsible position
on the company org chart), or you buy products
and expertise from outside vendors and consultants.
Here, we have a CIO and a lead engineer looking outside
the company for infrastructural building materials,
plus experts and expertise that are both <span   class="emphasis"><em>in</em></span>
the marketplace yet <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> for sale. In other words,
tools like Memcached and Spread are part of a larger
conversation, and a larger set of relationships, than
a corporate customer like Technorati would get from
a commercial vendor. This isn't a knock on vendors,
but it reminds us how markets defined in terms of
vendor relationships, and of sales volumes in product
categories, fail to include a large and growing part
of the market ecosystem.
</p><p>
Second, the advantages of using open-source tools, and of participating
in development projects like Memcached and Spread, are likely to be lost
on traditional IT shops that discourage trailblazing DIY work. Adam
Hertz explains:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Two themes: BigCoIT is all about standardization and isolationism.
</p><p>
Standardization, so the story goes, reduces risks and costs. It
certainly reduces complexity, but it can take a huge toll on
flexibility and responsiveness. Standardization often involves using
one multipurpose tool or platform to accomplish lots of different
purposes. This often involves customization, which is done by
in-house experts or professional services firms. Great examples are
Siebel, Lotus Notes and so on.
</p><p>
DIY shops tend to be cynical, or even downright frightened, of
systems like that, because they're so inflexible and unhackable.
</p><p>
Another form of standardization is what people are allowed to have
on their desktop PCs. In a lot of big shops, everyone has the same
disk image, with all applications pre-installed. There's a huge
suspicion of anything that comes from the outside world, especially
open source. It's regarded as flaky, virus-laden, unscalable and so on.
This produces isolationism, which means that there are major
barriers merely to try something.
</p><p>
In more open environments, there's a permeable membrane between the
corporate IT environment and the Net. People tend to get new tools
from the Net, usually open source, and just give 'em a spin.
Culturally, this keeps the organization open to innovation and new
approaches. It builds bonds between the employees and the
development community at large.
</p><p>
Standardized, isolationist shops miss out on all of this. The
maintain control, but they inevitably fall behind.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Third, Technorati isn't only solving problems, although
problem solving does soak up a lot of IT cycles. It's also looking to
tools like Memcached and Spread to open new business and other
opportunities. When I asked Adam about using Spread to expand
Technorati's Web service offerings, he said the opportunities, already
wide open, only get wider:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
It would also be very useful to implement customized watchlists, for
example. Suppose you had some weird-assed query...or more
accurately, filter. Like, very specific sorts of posts you want to
find out about&mdash;posts that mention you, <i  >Linux Journal</i> and open
source, for example. We could set that up as a subscriber to
updates. It could watch all the updates come by, discard the
99.99% of updates that aren't relevant, and when it gets a relevant
one, it could send you mail or something. Contrast that with our
current watchlist implementation that queries the database. Then
and imagine if&mdash;or when!  &mdash;we have 100,000 watchlists.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Fourth, Adam is quick to defer to his engineers' expertise, among which
is finding useful and free open-source tools in the marketplace. The
sounds Adam makes when he talks about his work remind me of those Linus
Torvalds makes when he talks about kernel maintainers.  Linus said:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
It is very hard to find people who don't flame and are calm and
rational&mdash;and have good taste. I mean it's like...give me one honest
man. It doesn't happen...too much. And at the same time, when it
happens, it matters a lot. Just a few of these people make a huge
difference.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Fifth, it becomes clear that trailblazing work by tasteful flameproof
engineers is what gives the world the infrastructure it needs to
supports real business, in addition to maintaining the mundane internal
operations of enterprises.
</p><p>
Just in the last few days, while I was writing this column, two other
open-source tools came to my attention. They're interesting because
they represent two extremes in the marketplace: one external, one internal.
</p><p>
The external one is the Gallery Project, which appears to be
establishing itself rapidly as the Apache of photo gallery software. Within a
week, Gallery went from something I barely knew to something it seemed
everybody was telling me about. It's an extraordinarily rich and deep
system that surely will be far more rich and deep by the time you read
this. It shows that Apple, Adobe and Microsoft aren't the only ones who
care to provide users and photographers with useful tools&mdash;and that
the tools that matter most aren't those that live on clients or vendor
hosting services, but rather on photographers' own servers, or those of
their friends, relatives and other parties, including businesses.
Gallery is pure DIY infrastructure and another dramatic example of how
the Net and open source allow the demand side to supply itself.
</p><p>
I also think it's significant that Galley scratches an itch that isn't
only technical. Although it's a bit of a hack to install, it's what
marketers call a consumer-facing service. It will be interesting to
watch the market effects over the coming year or two.
</p><p>
The internal tool is Yum (Yellowdog Updater Modified),
an automatic updater and package installer/remover for
RPM-based distributions, developed by the mathematics
department at Duke University&mdash;specifically by
Seth Vidal, the Senior Systems Programmer there.
</p><p>
Yum is public code, with public source repositories and a GPL license.
Yet it was developed by Duke for its own internal requirements. Richard
Hain, chair of the Math department, recently told me more than
100 Linux machines run in that department alone, with a serious
commitment to running Linux on the desktop, as well as on larger
machines for serious number crunching. Most office staff are running
Linux desktops. Microsoft Windows users are running on Win4Lin. Yum is a
necessity in their environment, Hain explains. Frequent hardware updates
alone require a &ldquo;departmental distro that runs Yum every day and
maintains packages&rdquo;.
</p><p>
So, it seems to me, the unusual suspects that matter most in open-source
markets aren't only the tools, but the independent spirits that create
and use them.
