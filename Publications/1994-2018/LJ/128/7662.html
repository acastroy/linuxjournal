How do you monitor multiple manufacturing lines in real time? We did it
ourselves with Linux.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c29580.0x1d215b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
A manufacturing company makes money only when production is running. So,
timely information from the production floor is crucial to the
business. As our company has grown, so has the complexity. We have outgrown
our manual and paper methods for monitoring manufacturing.
</p><p>
Midwest Tool &amp; Die stamps electronic terminals and molds plastic parts for
the automotive, electronics and consumer industries. Our manufacturing
processes generate a lot of data. Our high-speed presses make up to 1,200
parts per minute, and each part must be correct. We inspect critical
dimensions for every part that is produced. Part quality is charted and
monitored, and the data is archived for traceability.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c29580.0x1d21710"></a>
Why Automate?</h2></div></div><p>
We needed to manage all of this data to improve the manufacturing
processes. Our main goals were to improve uptime and understand the
causes for downtime. In addition, we hoped to track and control costs,
reduce paperwork and avoid human input error.
</p><p>
To meet these goals, we came up with requirements for the new system. The
first requirement was to gather data from a variety of machine controls,
sensors, automated inspection equipment, programmable logic controllers
(PLC) and human operators. The system had to be reliable and be capable
of gathering data at our fastest production rate.
</p><p>
Next, the system had to correlate the data that was gathered. The
system would need to interact with enterprise PostgreSQL
databases. Production data and process status would be passed to
PostgreSQL for display and reporting.
</p><p>
The new automation system also had to provide a user interface, so the machine
operator and maintenance personnel could log their activities. Process
downtime and the reason for the downtime would be logged and passed to
the enterprise databases. This requirement would replace a
paper log and manual data entry effort.
</p><p>
Finally, the system needed to be flexible and easily upgraded. The solution
would be adaptable to new manufacturing lines and changing system inputs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c29580.0x1d21978"></a>
Why Linux?</h2></div></div><p>
We evaluated several solutions to meet the requirements. Industrial PLCs
could gather data reliably. However, their approach to networking has been
stuck in proprietary nonstandards for decades. Ethernet connectivity has
become available, but the systems are expensive. The user interface
typically is implemented on vendor-specific display hardware. Each vendor
produces its own proprietary development platform. So, vendor lock-in
was an issue at every point of the evaluation.
</p><p>
Next, we looked at a PC with a data acquisition (DAQ)
board. In the past, we have used a laptop with a
DAQ board, Microsoft Windows and Agilent
VEE. This combination has worked well for quickly
acquiring data with little programming. With that
setup, data transfer to our database systems was
available only through Windows OLE. We could develop
applications, but the proprietary platform would
tie us in to the vendor. National Instruments also
offers a complete DAQ package for the PC, but at a
premium price.
</p><p>
The solution that best met our requirements also used a PC and a DAQ
board. The big difference was the use of RTLinux, a real-time OS stack
based on
Linux. We could limit vendor tie-in and communicate
freely with PostgreSQL and TCP/IP networking. The real-time OS offered
the reliability of a PLC, without sacrificing communications. Finally,
the GUI could be written in the language of our choice. Using open-source
tools, we could create flexible, upgradeable applications.

SmartPress System</h2></div></div><p>
The computers we chose to perform the task of data acquisition and
handling of the data were slow in comparison to computers available
today. We were able to recycle old office computers to use on the shop
floor. These 400MHz Celeron machines are fast enough to
perform the tasks asked of them adequately, without hindering our hard
real-time requirements for data acquisition.
The system we worked with started off with an installation of the Red Hat
7.3 distribution with the 2.4.18 Linux kernel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c29580.0x1d21df0"></a>
RTLinux and Linux kernels</h2></div></div><p>
The kernel separates the user-level tasks from the system
hardware.
The standard
Linux kernel allots slices of time to each user-level task and can
suspend the task when the time is up. This can lead to priority tasks
being delayed by your system's noncritical tasks. There are commands
to control the operations of the Linux scheduler; however, hacking the
scheduler's parameters in the 2.4 kernel does not result in a hard
real-time system. The 2.6 kernel has enhanced real-time performance but
does
not fill the needs of a hard real-time system either.
</p><p>
There are many great publications about RTLinux, many
of which are written by Michael Barabanov and Victor
Yodaiken, who first implemented RTLinux back in 1996
and have been improving it ever since. Finite State
Machine Labs, Inc., (FSMLabs) is a privately held
software company that maintains the software.
Through the years they have produced advancements that
are wrapped up into their professional versions
of RTLinux. They still do provide
RTLinux/Free, which must be used under the terms of
the GNU GPL and the Open RTLinux Patent License. For
our project, we used the free software, which
does not have support from FSMLabs.
</p><p>
The RTLinux HOWTO, by Dinil Divakaran, provided the
majority of the information we needed to
complete the RTLinux installation and get it up and
running on our system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c29580.0x1d21fa8"></a>
RTLinux System Flow</h2></div></div><p>
In a standard Linux system, if you wrote a function to poll the inputs
of a data acquisition card at a set interval, your task would have
less than favorable results. Such a system cannot guarantee the scheduling
priority that it would receive. In the standard Linux operating system,
as illustrated in Figure 2, all of the system processes are isolated
from the hardware. This would not be so bad if our data polling was the
only process the system performed. Our project, however, required user-space programs and a guarantee that the sensor inputs were polled every
1 millisecond. The hard real-time system would guarantee that sensor
inputs would not be missed.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7662f2.large.jpg"><img src="7662f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. RTLinux System Flow
</p></div></div><p>
In the RTLinux operating system, also illustrated in Figure 2, the
real-time task is isolated from the rest of the system processes
and is implemented as a module. The module gains direct access to the
hardware and the DAQ card drivers while receiving the priority that it
needs over the rest of the system. The module is written to perform
a specific task that produces reliable results and presents them
to the user through the FIFO device files. The code for the module is
kept simple, performing only tasks that must be held to hard real-time
restraints. Connecting a handler function to one of the FIFO device
files can control the module from the operator interface program. This
structure, produced by RTLinux, ensures that the kernel cannot delay
important module task with secondary priorities.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c29580.0x1d222c0"></a>
Data Acquisition Threads</h2></div></div><p>
We needed to monitor only digital input status with hard real-time
requirements, which made the real-time function fairly small. Polling
the data inputs was made easy, because United Electronics Industries
provided RTLinux drivers with their DAQ card. A DAQ card from ADLINK
Technology, Inc., also was tested with drivers for the RTLinux platform, and
it configured easily. Not many companies provided
such a service. The Comedi Project, however, offers another option for
open-source drivers, tools and libraries for
data acquisition.
</p><p>
The real-time task was written in the form of
a loadable module, which has to have at least
two functions: init_module, called
when the module is inserted into the kernel, and
cleanup_module, which is called right before it was
removed (Listing 1).
</p><p>
Once the base module structure was established, we needed to create
a thread for our real-time task in the module.
The thread was created
inside of the init_module and was set up to run with established RTLinux
priorities. Establishing the priority and rate of execution for the
thread was an important step to creating our real-time task.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c29580.0x1d22478"></a>
FIFO Device Files</h2></div></div><p>
With a task running with predictable timing, real-time memory for data
transfer was needed. The user-level task needed to access collected
data and to control the real-time task. Real-time FIFOs are queues that
can be read from and written to by Linux processes. The real-time FIFO
devices are built during the RTLinux installation and created in the
initialization of the real-time modules. Now a handler can be created
and tied to one of the FIFO Devices. The handler can be set up to execute
when 1 is written to the handler FIFO from the user interface program
as controlling of the module is needed.
</p><p>
The module was created in order to be installed into the kernel as a
real-time task. The tricky part of the real-time module was setting
up the framework. Our real-time task code was straightforward, but
lengthy. So, we've included only the real-time module skeleton
(Listing 1). Notice the simplicity of the code that is implemented with
real-time requirements.

User Interface</h2></div></div><p>
With the real-time task up and running, the next step
was to build the user interface for the project. The
GUI was one of many tasks in our program that did
not need to be accomplished within hard real-time
restraints. We did not have heavy concerns for system
resources, because our real-time module would execute
within our established hard real-time requirements. We
selected KDevelop IDE and Qt Designer GUI builder
from Trolltech for programming the interface. Qt
Designer allowed for the development of a GUI with
signal and slot interaction with functions in the
KDevelop program. The result of developing with
the combination of the two packages was perfect for
our application. We were able to develop a
user-friendly interface quickly.
</p><p>
The program was written to utilize two forms of information feed to the
system: the digital inputs from the DAQ card and the human operator
interaction with the GUI. The combination of the two was needed to
maintain the integrity of the data. For example, the operator would
enter the part number for the job being manufactured. The data that was
gathered during the run would be tied to the part number. This replaced
the old method of having the user tally information on handwritten forms.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c29580.0x1d229a0"></a>
Managing the Data</h2></div></div><p>
Gathering the data was only the first step for the system and program. The
most important aspect was to make it usable by all of the departments of
the company. The scheduling department, material purchasing department
and tool service departments are some examples of where the data
will be put to good use.
</p><p>
The SmartPress program stored the gathered data in a PostgreSQL
database. PostgreSQL also is our enterprise back-end database. So,
future application development will make SmartPress data visible in
enterprise applications across the company.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c29580.0x1d22b00"></a>
Summary&mdash;Do-It-Yourself Information Technology</h2></div></div><p>
Our SmartPress system has moved from the test bed to the production
floor. Looking back, we have created a flexible manufacturing monitoring
system. Using Linux, the result is an expandable system that has been
customized to the needs of the company. We can adapt the SmartPress
for new manufacturing processes. The system also is upgradeable. In
the future, we intend to rebuild the project on a newer kernel. For the
upgrade, we probably will use Fedora Core as the base Linux platform.
</p><p>
The SmartPress system's low hardware cost is
important as we are installing a system for each
stamping press line. We cut hardware costs by using
personal computers and DAQ boards that were supported
under Linux. Our software development also
was inexpensive. The time that Ryan Walsh spent on
this project was similar to learning and developing in
a proprietary controls language. Now, Ryan is fluent
with kernel modules, real-time operating systems,
PostgreSQL and GUI development. These skills are
much more useful than learning one vendor's control
programming language. For us, the do-it-yourself
option resulted in lower cost, no vendor tie-in
and upgraded developer skills.
