Put a powerful revision control system to work for you with
only Web and SSH software on the server side. Here's what you
need to administer a software projet with Arch.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e5580.0x19dd2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Arch is part of a recent generation of revision
control systems that provide an important
architectural advantage over the old Concurrent Version System (CVS)
and its work-alikes.
As a decentralized revision control system, Arch
allows remote users to join large development
efforts without needing to acquire special access
privileges. Arch also provides powerful
inter-archive operations that encourage
participation from third-party contributors.
</p><p>
The previous article in this series [<i  >LJ</i>, November
2004] demonstrated
basic Arch operations, such as checking out code and
creating branches from remote archives. This
installment shows how to revert changes in
an archive, how to publish your private archives to
public mirrors and how to move a copy of your
changes from archive to archive when you forget to
make a new branch.
</p><p>
The Arch program is called tla. The program name arch is
taken by the POSIX standard,
which requires that /bin/arch report system information.
A lot of information can be found by running
<tt  >tla help</tt>. If you need to figure out the arguments
to a particular command, such as commit, it helps to run <tt  >tla commit -H</tt>, to see what the tla
commit command can do.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e5580.0x19dd5b0"></a>
Backing Out Changes </h2></div></div><p>
One of the more immediate benefits of any revision
control system is the ability to undo a change or
set of changes. Everyone makes mistakes now and
again, and it is important for your tools to provide
the means to a graceful recovery.
</p><p>
The quickest way to return a checked-out tree to a
state without your local changes is to run <tt  >tla
undo</tt>. This creates a directory called
,,undo-1/ that contains all of the changes made.
If you so desire, you simply can <tt  >tla redo</tt> to
re-apply those changes. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ tla register-archive http://www.lnx-bbc.org/arch
$ tla get \
  lnx-bbc-devel@zork.net--gar/lnx-bbc--stable bbc
$ cd bbc/
$ echo "BIG MISTAKE" &gt; robots.txt
$ echo "#smaller change" &gt;&gt; Makefile
$ tla undo
$ tla redo

</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >tla undo</tt> command is most useful during
hold-that-thought moments, when a line of work needs to
be set aside briefly for a quick change of some
sort. Arch uses the undo and redo commands
internally when performing operations such as update
or star-merge.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e5580.0x19dd920"></a>
Reverting One File</h2></div></div><p>
If a mistake is localized to a single file,
the entire
changeset doesn't need to be backed out. Arch lets you revert the changes made to
a single file by generating a unified diff
representing that file's changes since the last
commit. This diff then can be fed into the patch
program in reverse mode, which causes the changes to
be unpatched out of the file.

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tla file-diffs robots.txt | patch -R
</pre>
</p><p>
If the file had been deleted accidentally, it would
be necessary to do <tt  >touch robots.txt</tt> before executing
this command. Without a file (even an empty one),
Arch has no basis from which to generate the
file-diffs. When working with complete changesets,
however, Arch is far more intelligent.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e5580.0x19ddb30"></a>
Reverting Entire Changeset</h2></div></div><p>
One of the big advantages Arch has over its
predecessor, CVS, is that it permits the creation
and manipulation of changesets. A changeset is a
complete collection of all the edits, renames,
added and deleted files and log entries
recorded during a single <tt  >tla commit</tt> invocation.
</p><p>
Sometimes a changeset is committed that shouldn't
be, or a temporary approach to something
needs to be backed out before a more permanent one
can be implemented. In these cases,
revert the changeset by replaying it in reverse:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ tla replay --reverse \
  jrh@zork.net--projects/foo--bar--1.0--patch-4
$ tla sync-tree \
  jrh@zork.net--projects/foo--bar--1.0--patch-4

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e5580.0x19ddd98"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The first command reverts the fourth changeset in
the 1.0 version of the bar branch of the foo tree,
even if it is not the most recent revision. This
has the added effect of backing out the log entry
for that changeset as well, so you can use the <tt  >tla
sync-tree</tt> command to put the commit log back the
way it ought to be.
</p><p>
The patch-4 changeset still is stored in the
jrh@zork.net&mdash;projects archive, and the tree
still can be checked out in that state. Only the
current working copy of the code has been affected
by the above commands. When the above user runs
<tt  >tla commit</tt>, a new changeset will be added that
includes the inverse of patch-4.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e5580.0x19ddfa8"></a>
Cherry-Picking Changes from Another Branch</h2></div></div><p>
The <tt  >tla replay</tt> command can be used for more
powerful operations than a simple <tt  >undo</tt>. One of
the more compelling features of Arch is the ability
to cherry-pick particular changesets from a remote
archive without having to apply changes you don't
need.
</p><p>
Consider the project, foo, maintained by Bob. Bob
keeps a stable branch of the project (foo--stable)
and an experimental branch (foo--experimental). All
releases are generated from the stable branch&mdash;foo--stable--2.4.2 being the most recent. The
experimental branch is where adventurous new
features are made available in a somewhat official
location.
</p><p>
Alice plans to work on some experimental code, so
she tags off Bob's experimental branch to work in
her own space:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ tla my-id "Alice B. Hacker &lt;abh@zork.net&gt;"
$ tla make-archive -l abh@zork.net--work \
  sftp://abh@zork.net/home/abh/public_html/arch
$ tla archive-setup foo--hackery--0.0
$ tla register-archive http://entar.net/~bob/fooarch
$ tla tag \
  bob@entar.net--code/foo--experimental--0.0 \
  abh@zork.net--work/foo--hackery--1.0

</pre>

</p><p>
In the process of working on her experimental
features, Alice discovers a bug that Bob must have
overlooked. The fix is simple, so she puts her
current work aside with <tt  >tla undo</tt> and checks in the
fix:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ tla undo
$ vi buggy_file.c another_buggy_file.c
$ tla commit
M  buggy_file.c
M  another_buggy_file.c
* committed
  abh@zork.net--work/foo--hackery--1.0--patch-9
$ tla redo

</pre>
</p><p>
Alice soon finishes her changes and tells Bob where
her archive lives. Bob decides that her code is
acceptable for the experimental branch and
star-merges it in:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ tla get bob@entar.net--code/foo--experimental--0.0
$ cd foo--experimental--0.0/
$ tla register-archive http://zork.net/~abh/arch/
$ tla star-merge \
  abh@zork.net--work/foo--hackery--1.0

</pre>
</p><p>
While reading Alice's changelog, Bob realizes
the bug she fixed exists in the stable branch as
well. Because he doesn't want to grab all of the
experimental code from her hackery branch, Bob
cherry-picks only the changeset that contains the
bug fix:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ tla get bob@entar.net--code/foo--stable--2.4.2
$ cd foo--stable--2.4.2/
$ tla replay \
  abh@zork.net--work/foo--hackery--1.0--patch-9

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e5580.0x19de4d0"></a>
Publishing Your Changesets</h2></div></div><p>
Alice and Bob were able to work together despite the
fact that neither developer shared access to a
single system. Neither developer had set up any
sort of dedicated server; they were able to use standard stock
protocols such as HTTP, SSH and SFTP. Alice's
archive had the advantage of being accessible from a
Web directory on the Internet, just as Bob's
official archive was.
</p><p>
Arch provided the tools for Alice and Bob to
manipulate their two separate archives, and the
differences between them, using nothing more exotic
than Apache and OpenSSH.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e5580.0x19de688"></a>
Signatures</h2></div></div><p>
Sending so much code over the Internet always
has made free software developers at least a little
nervous, even if only in the back of their minds.
The current system of peer review seems to have
solved the problem of malicious code submissions
quickly and effectively, but it would help to be
able to identify each changeset's author beyond a
reasonable doubt.
</p><p>
Arch allows developers to sign
their changesets cryptographically, allowing verification of submitter
identity through a web of trust. Although this does not
conclusively prove the intentions of the developer
in question, it raises the bar for forged
submissions.
</p><p>
To use cryptographic signatures in Arch,
you first must generate a GnuPG key.

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gpg --gen-key
</pre>
</p><p>
Unfortunately, signed archives are somewhat
different functionally from the unsigned variety.
This makes it necessary to keep a separate archive
for signed commits. Running <tt  >tla make-archive</tt> with
the -s switch creates an archive capable of storing
GnuPG signatures:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ tla make-archive -ls jrh@zork.net--signed \
  ~/SIGNED-ARCHIVE
$ tla my-default-archive jrh@zork.net--signed

</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, a few configuration files must be created
in order for Arch to sign changesets and verify
signatures. First, an awk script
included in the tla distribution, called
gpg-check.awk, must be installed
somewhere on the system where Arch is run. The
Debian tla packages install it to
/usr/bin/tla-gpg-check by default.
In order for Arch to verify signatures,
the file ~/.arch-params/signing/=default.check
should contain a single line that reads:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ mkdir ~/.arch-params/signing/
$ echo \
 'tla-gpg-check gpg_command="gpg --verify-files -"'\
  &gt; ~/.arch-params/signing/\=default.check

</pre>
</p><p>
If you want keys to be downloaded automatically from
a public keyserver as needed, you can add parameters
such as <tt  >--keyserver pgp.mit.edu --keyserver-options
auto-key-retrieve</tt> to the gpg_command. This
causes Arch to download keys from <a href="http://pgp.mit.edu" target="_self">pgp.mit.edu</a> as
needed and verify the signatures in an archive
against these keys during the get or update
operations.
</p><p>
For Arch to sign changesets
automatically that you commit to an archive created with
the -s option, the ~/.arch-params/signing/=default
file must be one single line like the following,
substituting the address you used when you created
your key:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ echo \
  'gpg --default-key "&lt;jrh@zork.net&gt;" --clearsign' \
  &gt; ~/.arch-params/signing/\=default

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e5580.0x19dec08"></a>
Mirrors</h2></div></div><p>
In the above cherry-picking example, Alice B. Hacker
used a Web-accessible directory for her personal
archive. This is convenient, but it poses a problem
for disconnected use. What if Alice wanted to work
from her laptop during a long airplane flight or
train ride? She either would have to generate
changeset tarballs with <tt  >tla changes</tt> or
star-merge her various branches manually one by one from her
laptop to her Web-space archive when she reached a
network connection.
Fortunately, Arch permits the creation of archives
that are simply mirrors of other archives:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ tla make-archive -ls --mirror-from \
  jrh@zork.net--signed \
  sftp://jrh@zork.net/public_html/arch/

</pre>
</p><p>
In this instance of make-archive, J. Random Hacker
is creating an archive in his public_html directory
on an Internet server. Once the mirror archive is
created, it shows up in a tla archives listing as
<tt  >jrh@zork.net--signed-MIRROR</tt>. Now data can be
pushed to it with a single command:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ tla archive-mirror jrh@zork.net--signed

</pre>
</p><p>
In addition to push mirrors that copy local
archive data to remote systems, Arch allows pull
mirrors that create local copies of remote archives:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ tla make-archive -ls --mirror \
  lnx-bbc-devel@zork.net--gar \
  /var/tmp/gar-cache
$ tla archive-mirror lnx-bbc-devel@zork.net--gar

</pre>
</p><p>
This can be handy during disconnected operation,
when a local branch may not be sufficient. Pull
mirrors allow read-only access to a remote archive's
data while off the Net.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e5580.0x1dd7220"></a>
Signed Mirrors</h2></div></div><p>
One drawback to the jrh@zork.net&mdash;signed-MIRROR
archive is that it is a separate signed archive in
its own right. This means J. Random Hacker
must sign each changeset as it is copied from the
original archive to the mirror.
</p><p>
In some cases, this is the desired effect. A
release manager personally vouches for each
changeset that enters the public mirror, for
example. In most cases, however, it is important simply to
copy the existing signatures along with the
changeset.
This is achieved by creating a special file on the
system where <tt  >tla archive-mirror</tt> is run:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ echo jrh@zork.net--signed &gt; \
  ~/.arch-params/signing/jrh@zork.net--signed-MIRROR

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e5580.0x1dd7430"></a>
Working Off-line (Even If You're Absent-Minded)</h2></div></div><p>
Mirrors are extremely useful, but they are, by nature,
read-only. The only way changes can be
committed to a mirror is through the original archive by
way of <tt  >tla archive-mirror</tt>.
</p><p>
Consider Alice's laptop mirror situation. While
sitting in the observation car of Amtrak's Coast
Starlight, she pulls out her laptop and does <tt  >tla get</tt>
to grab some code out of a local mirror of
abh@zork.net--work. Somewhere in the Willamette
Valley, she finds inspiration and completes a
remarkably useful hack.
</p><p>
Any attempt to commit her changes would receive the
message <tt  >attempt to write directly to mirror</tt>, which
means the commit failed. The simple solution
is to wait until she reaches an Internet access
point and use the undo and redo commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tla undo ,changes-to-mirror
$ cd ~/real-project/
$ tla redo ~/mirror-checkout/,changes-to-mirror/
$ tla commit
</pre>
</p><p>
This works fine if your changes are not enough to
require more than one changeset. For longer
detached sessions, you'll want to make a new local
branch.
</p><p>
After her trip down the Pacific Coast, Alice takes
the Zephyr to Chicago. It is a longer trip, and
she found herself working in a local mirror of
bob@entar.net--code on the foo--stable--2.4.2 code.
After a few hours of work, she decides to move her
changes to a new branch.
</p><p>
First, she makes a new archive and branch on her
laptop:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tla make-archive -l abh@zork.net--laptop ~/arch
$ tla my-default-archive abh@zork.net--laptop
$ tla archive-setup foo--laptop-hacks--1.0
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, she tags off the mirror branch to her new
archive. She runs the <tt  >tla logs</tt> command in shell
backticks so she doesn't have to remember which
patch level and version she was working in at the
moment:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ tla tag `tla logs -r -f | head -n 1` \
  foo--laptop-hacks--1.0

</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, Alice coerces the checked-out copy into
believing it is the first revision in her new
laptop-hacks branch:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tla sync-tree foo--laptop-hacks--1.0--base-0
$ tla set-tree-version foo--laptop-hacks--1.0
</pre>
</p><p>
At this point, she has shifted her checked-out copy
from the read-only mirror over to a read-write
archive hosted on her laptop.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e5580.0x1dd7ab8"></a>
Branching without an Archive</h2></div></div><p>
Setting up mirrors before long disconnected sessions
is a lot like packing for a trip: you always forget
the one thing you really needed. It would be
frustrating to plug your laptop in to the light
socket of your mountain cabin only to find that your
checked-out copy of some crucial code came from an
HTTP archive.
</p><p>
Fortunately, you can use some of the same techniques
to move a checked-out copy to a new branch even if
you can't reach the old read-only archive.
</p><p>
Alice checked out a copy of a project called bar
while sitting in an Internet caf&eacute; in Chicago. On her
return trip to California, she decides to work on
the code. After another hour of prodigious efforts,
she decides yet again that it is time to make her
own branch in which to work.
</p><p>
Because the original archive is inaccessible, tagging
off a branch is impossible. Fortunately, much of
the changelog and history information is present in
the checked-out tree, so Alice temporarily backs out
her changes with <tt  >tla undo</tt> and then forces the
checked-out copy into her new branch:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tla archive-setup bar--train-ride--1.0
$ tla set-tree-version bar--train-ride--1.0
$ tla add-log-version bar--train-ride--1.0
$ tla import
</pre>
</p><p>
Once this is done, Alice runs <tt  >tla redo</tt> and then
<tt  >tla commit</tt>. Now the revision she grabbed in
Chicago is bar--train-ride--1.0--base-0, and her
changes are bar--train-ride--1.0--patch-1.
</p><p>
Although this method is not perfect, it still is
possible to star-merge to and from the original
branch without trouble. If Alice found her work on
the bar project to be more involved, she most
likely would merge with the upstream archive and make a
proper branch when she found Internet access again.

Tune in Next Time</h2></div></div><p>
You now know how to publish your archives to the
Internet and how to work remotely with Arch. You
even have a few tricks up your sleeve for when you
make mistakes,
</p><p>
The third and final article in this series will show
you how to administer a centralized official
archive while retaining all of the benefits of
Arch's distributed workings. You'll learn some
tricks for scripting around your archives to create
