    Professor Ortiz presents a little of the theory behind the
    three-tier architecture and shows how it may be applied
    using Linux, Java and MiniSQL.

Every program and piece of data was stored in a single almighty
machine. Users could access this centralized computer only by means
of dumb terminals. (See Figure 1.)

</p><p>In the 1980s, the arrival of inexpensive network-connected
PCs produced the popular two-tier client-server architecture. In
this architecture, there is an application running in the client
machine which interacts with the server&mdash;most commonly, a database
management system (see Figure 2). Typically, the client
application, also known as a fat client, contained some or all of
the presentation logic (user interface), the application
navigation, the business rules and the database access. Every time
the business rules were modified, the client application had to be
changed, tested and redistributed, even when the user interface
remained intact. In order to minimize the impact of business logic
alteration within client applications, the presentation logic must
be separated from the business rules. This separation becomes the
fundamental principle in the three-tier architecture.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3508f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Two-Tier Client-Server Architecture
</p></div></div><p>In a three-tier architecture (also known as a multi-tier
architecture), there are three or more interacting tiers, each with
its own specific responsibilities (see Figure 3):</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3508f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Three-Tier Architecture
</p></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Tier 1: the client contains the presentation logic,
including simple control and user input validation. This
application is also known as a thin client.</p></li><li><p>Tier 2: the middle tier is also known as the
application server, which provides the business processes logic and
the data access.</p></li><li><p>Tier 3: the data server provides the business
data.</p></li></ul></div><p>These are some of the advantages of a three-tier
architecture:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>It is easier to modify or replace any tier without
affecting the other tiers.</p></li><li><p>Separating the application and database
functionality means better load balancing.</p></li><li><p>Adequate security policies can be enforced within
the server tiers without hindering the clients.</p></li></ul></div>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f87580.0x2080210"></a>Putting the Theory into Practice</h2></div></div><p>In order to demonstrate these design concepts, the general
outline of a simple three-tier &ldquo;Hangman&rdquo; game will be presented
(check the source code in the archive file). The purpose of this
game, just in case the reader isn't familiar with it, is to try to
guess a mystery word, one letter at a time, before making a certain
number of mistakes.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3508f4.large.jpg"><img src="3508f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. Hangman Client Running in Windows
98</p></div></div>
</p><p>The data server is a Linux box running the MiniSQL database
management system. The database is used to store the mystery words.
At the beginning of each game, one of these words is randomly
selected.</p><p>At the client side, a Java applet contained in a web page
(originally obtained from a web server) is responsible for the
application's graphical user interface (see Figure 4). The client
platform may be any computer with a web browser that supports
applets. The game's logic is not controlled by the applet; that's
the middle tier's job. The client only takes care of the
presentation logic: getting the user's input, performing some
simple checking and drawing the resulting output.</p><p>The server in the middle tier is a Java application, also
running within a Linux box. The rules of the &ldquo;Hangman&rdquo; game (the
business rules) are coded in this tier. Sockets and JDBC,
respectively, are used to communicate with the client and the data
server through TCP/IP.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3508f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Diagram of Hardware Nodes
</p></div></div><p>Figure 5 presents a UML (Unified Modeling Language)
deployment diagram that shows the physical relationship among the
hardware nodes of the system.</p><p>Even though the design described gives the impression of
requiring a different machine for each tier, all tiers (each one
running on a different process) can be run in the same computer.
This means the complete application is able to run in a single
Linux system with a graphical desktop, and it doesn't even have to
be connected to the Net!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f87580.0x2080898"></a>Running MiniSQL</h2></div></div><p>MiniSQL, developed by Hughes Technologies, is an
exceptionally fast DBMS with very low system requirements. It
supports a fairly useful subset of the Structured Query Language
(SQL). Using it for commercial purposes requires purchasing a
license, although free licenses are provided for academic and
charity organizations.</p><p>The software is distributed in source code form, all bundled
up in a gzipped tar file (currently, the latest distribution file
is msql-2.0.11.tar.gz). It may be downloaded from the Hughes
Technology web site (see Resources). The MiniSQL manual, with all
the necessary installation and usage information, is contained in
the files msql-2.0.11/doc/manual.ps.gz and msql-
2.0.11/doc/manual-html/manual.html, once the distribution file is
extracted. The reader is encouraged to carefully review and follow
the instructions contained there. However, it must be noted that
two important details are missing from the MiniSQL manual:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The &ldquo;system&rdquo; section contained in the
/usr/local/Hughes/msql.conf file has a parameter called
Remote_Access that has a default value of <b  >false</b>.
It must be changed to <b  >true</b> in order to allow
access to the database from remote systems.</p></li><li><p>Like other server d&aelig;mons (for example, the
HTTP web server), the MiniSQL 2.0 server, called msql2d, should be
run as a background process. Executing the following command as
root should achieve this: <b  >/usr/local/Hughes/bin/msql2d
&amp;</b></p></li></ul></div><p>In addition to the database server, MiniSQL comes with some
other useful utilities: a server administration program, an
interactive SQL monitor, a schema viewer, a data dumper and a
table-data exporter and importer. The server administration program
is required to create the Hangman database that will contain the
mystery words. The following command must be executed as root:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/Hughes/bin/msqladmin create hangman
</pre>


Afterward, a mystery-words table needs to be created. Only two
columns will be contained in this table: word (the mystery word or
sentence) and category (a classification for the mystery word:
computers, animals, movies, etc.), both of them being character
strings. Also, a few rows should be inserted. The interactive SQL
monitor may be used for both purposes. Executing the command
<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/Hughes/bin/msql hangman
</pre>


enters the interactive monitor with the &ldquo;hangman&rdquo; database. The
MiniSQL prompt should appear. SQL queries can now be issued,
followed by &ldquo;\g&rdquo;(GO) to indicate that the query should be sent to
the database server. Here are the SQL commands for the Hangman
application:
<pre     class="programlisting">
create table mystery (word char(40), category char(15))\g
insert into mystery values ('elephant', 'animals')\g
insert into mystery values ('rhinoceros', 'animals')\g
insert into mystery values ('gone with the wind', 'movies')\g
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f87580.0x20776a8"></a>Accessing the MiniSQL from a Java
Program</h2></div></div><p>The application's middle tier uses Blackdown's Linux Port
Java Development Kit 1.2.2, release candidate 4, and CIE's
mSQL-JDBC driver for JDBC 2.0. The Java tutorial is one of many
excellent places to learn how to access databases from within a
Java program; that's why only the specific issues on accessing
MiniSQL will be dealt with here.</p><p>Before attempting to access the MiniSQL server from a Java
application, the corresponding JDBC driver must be installed. The
driver may be freely downloaded from The Center for Imaginary
Environments web site (see Resources). The distribution file comes
with many things, but the most important part is the JAR file that
contains the driver itself (currently, the file is
msql-jdbc-2.0b5.jar). The easiest way to install the driver is to
copy the JAR file to the /usr/local/jdk1.2.2/jre/lib/ext directory
(root privileges are required to copy files to this
directory).</p><p>In order to load the driver from the Java program, the
following statement should be executed:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Class.forName("com.imaginary.sql.msql.MsqlDriver");
</pre><p>The connection to the database server is established when
executing this statement (ignore line wrap):
<pre     class="programlisting">
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection
 ('jdbc:msql://localhost:1114/hangman');
</pre>


Inside the JDBC URL, the URL of a remote system should replace
&ldquo;localhost&rdquo; if the MiniSQL server is not running in the same
machine. 1114 is the default port number to which the MiniSQL
server is listening. The msql.conf file can be modified in order to
specify another port number.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f87580.0x2077968"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>The three-tier architecture is a versatile and modular
infrastructure intended to improve usability, flexibility,
interoperability and scalability. Linux, Java and MiniSQL result in
an interesting combination for learning how to build three-tier
architecture systems. Nevertheless, more convenient implementations
than the one presented here may be produced using component
technology in the middle tier, such as CORBA (Common Object Request
Broker Architecture), EJB (Enterprise Java Beans) and DCOM
(Distributed Component Object Model). The interested reader should
review these topics to get a better understanding of the current
three-tier architecture capabilities.</p><p><a href="3508s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
