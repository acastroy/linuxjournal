    Troll Tech enters the embedded systems market&mdash;here's what's
    happening.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf31580.0x1029608"></a></h2></div></div><p>Troll Tech announced in March that it is
developing Qt/Embedded, a new GUI toolkit for embedded Linux
systems. The toolkit aims to provide embedded systems developers
with the same power and cross-platform portability as the desktop
versions of Qt, Qt/Windows and Qt/X11.
</p><p>Linux users will recognize Qt as the GUI toolkit that powers
the popular K Desktop Environment (KDE), now a standard component
of most Linux distributions including Caldera OpenLinux 2.4, Linux
Mandrake 7.0, Corel Linux 1.0, Red Hat Linux 6.2 and Slackware
7.0.</p><p>Unlike Troll Tech's Qt/X11 product for Linux, Qt/Embedded
does not require the X Window System. Instead, Qt/Embedded
applications access the Linux frame buffer directly. Removing X
reduces the memory requirements of the toolkit drastically, leaving
more memory available for applications.</p><p>While Troll Tech is not aiming to replace X, it may do so in
some cases. Qt/Embedded includes its own windowing system, allowing
multiple applications to run with overlapping windows. Qt/Embedded
will not, however, provide remote display capabilities like X.
Qt/Embedded also provides its own support for TrueType fonts, a
function normally provided by X.</p><p>Because Qt/Embedded is source-code compatible with Qt 2.1,
any application that works with Qt 2.1 can be built with
Qt/Embedded. In fact, a version of KDE has already been tested with
Qt/Embedded. It's unlikely that all the current KDE and Qt
applications will begin showing up on embedded devices. However,
certain applications, such as the Qt version of the Mozilla
browser, are obvious candidates for an embedded device.</p><p>KDE's success has been an asset to Troll Tech. It certainly
can't hurt the future of Qt/Embedded to have a growing number of
open-source developers around the world familiar with Qt
development.</p><p>

</p><p>The Qt/Embedded API will be identical to the existing API
used in Qt 2.1, allowing applications to be portable from UNIX and
Windows desktops to embedded systems. Developers can use either Qt
or X11 to develop their application, allowing them to leverage a
huge base of desktop tools. The application can be deployed on the
target system simply by rebuilding with Qt/Embedded.</p><p>Qt/X11's original license caused many concerns in Linux and
Open Source communities due to its restrictions on commercial
usage. Qt did not meet the official open-source definition,
preventing KDE from being included in some Linux distributions. In
response, Troll Tech developed the Q Public License (QPL), a new,
less-restrictive license that qualifies as open source. The new
license has been a significant factor in the success of both Qt and
KDE.</p><p>Qt/Embedded application programmers will need to purchase a
Development Kit license under terms similar to the Qt Professional
Edition. There will also be a run-time license for each device in
which Qt/Embedded is installed.</p><p>If you're an open-source developer, the licensing terms might
not sound very inviting to you. Learning from past licensing
problems, Troll Tech hasn't forgotten the open-source developer.
Although details have not been finalized, Troll Tech plans to make
available a free edition of the Development Kit that will make it
possible to write open-source applications for use on devices with
Qt/Embedded already installed.</p><p>Up until now, talking about Qt in the Linux community meant
Qt/X11. With Qt/Embedded on the way, Linux developers have more
options. Linux has continued to garner interest in the embedded
systems market, and an advanced GUI toolkit such as Qt will make
Linux that much more attractive.</p><p>The general release of Qt/Embedded is targeted for the third
quarter of this year, with OEMs receiving pre-releases earlier. At
the time of publication, Troll Tech had not yet announced pricing
details for the run-time licenses or the Developer Kit.</p><p><a href="4023s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
