This column is dedicated to those responses. Those for which there
was no room can be found in &ldquo;More Letters&rdquo; on the <i>LJ</i> web site. I
was particularly amazed that some people took this as &ldquo;sexual&rdquo;
and therefore obscene. The Post Office and our newsstand
distributors all cleared this cover as non-offensive. Our only
intent was to have a bit of fun, and we are sorry to have offended
anyone. By the way, guys, what do you think of the May 1 cover of

should do something like this again soon. I just got an e-mail from
Mike O'Dell, senior VP and chief scientist at UUNET, who told me,
&ldquo;your article restores my hope for humanity&rdquo; and &ldquo;this almost
makes me feel good enough to write a program!&rdquo;</p><p>I mentioned this to Andrew Kuchling, and he mentioned some
negative feedback you've received. I wonder what that was about?
The python.org web site received a flame from someone offended by
the naked man on the cover, and in the edu-sig, there was a
discussion (<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a flamewar!) of gender
stereotypes, but in general I've seen mostly positive responses and
encouraging words.</p><p>&mdash;Guido van Rossumguido@python.org</p><p>I just want to congratulate you on the excellent Python
supplement included with the May edition of the best Linux magazine
around!</p><p>I am not a professional programmer, but after reading the
excellent articles included in said supplement, I was buzzing to
get down to some serious programming using Python! I do not know
what, but there was something in the way the articles written that
just excited me!</p><p>Everything that comes out of the Linux community seems to
always be bursting with energy and excitement. I looove it!! Keep
up the excellent work!</p><p>&mdash;Rui Pinhor.pinho@ic.ac.uk</p><p>I've been very pleased with my subscription to
<i  >Linux Journal</i> over the past three-plus years,
but I was particularly unimpressed with the cover of the Special
Supplement included with the May 2000 issue.</p><p>Not only did I find it unprofessional and distasteful, but it
was also somewhat embarrassing to receive a magazine at my office
with male nudity on the cover.</p><p>I hope you'll accept this as constructive criticism and will
carefully consider future covers. There are many other tasteful
alternatives that would have better served the reputation of your
otherwise fine publication.</p><p>&mdash;Doug Ledbetterdougl@mnu.edu</p><p>I just got my new <i  >Linux Journal</i>, and was
shocked at what I found on the cover of the Special Supplement. I
hope the <i  >Linux Journal</i> isn't going to start
doing things for shock value. Please don't. (The secretary got a
thrill out of it, though.) I actually took a marker and drew in
some clothes.</p><p>&mdash;Walter Williamswwilliams@mountain-cad.com</p><p>What were you thinking displaying a picture of a naked person
on the cover of your supplement? A lot of people (like me) receive
this magazine at work. It's hard enough for me to get people in
this company to take Linux seriously (especially with the
ridiculous penguin logo). Now I have to get funny looks and explain
to people (including my <span   class="emphasis"><em>boss</em></span>) why I get
magazines with pictures of naked men on them sent to me at
work.</p><p>It's a poor attempt at humor. Some of us have to work in a
professional environment, and this damn near cost me my job.</p><p>&mdash;Phil Garrettpgarrett@hillmgt.com</p><p>Nice cover on the May 2000 issue! Love those penguinistas
raining down on Redmond. And keep those Python articles
coming!</p><p>&mdash;Darryldarryl@igor.penguinpowered.com</p><p>The cover is repulsive and offensive. It is very
inappropriate in the business environment. If you wanted to get our
attention, you did! We will not renew our subscription and I sure
don't understand the logic behind this.</p><p>&mdash;Ed Hutchinsonehutch@raex.com</p><p>Hi there. I don't currently subscribe to <i  >Linux Journal</i>, but I do use computers and the UNIX OS quite a
bit. Anyway, I went to your web site and saw the cover of the
Python supplement. I just wanted to say, good for you, guys! Geeks
have long been bombarded with images of naked women, often
anatomically impossible images at that, and it's about time we had
some naked men for nerd girls to look at. :)</p><p>&mdash;Jina Chanjina@speakeasy.org</p><p>Must say, this is the first issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> I've ever read, despite being a Linux fan and
having Tux propaganda in my cubicle at work. It was really nice to
see the running Python gag throughout ... technical journals can be
so dull! Thank you for having a sense of humor, at least once in a
while.</p><p>As for the cover ... if hot-rod magazines can have barely
clad women on the cover, I say &ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; to cute naked men on the
cover of computer journals! About time. If more computer journals
had naked guys in them, I might read more of them. ;) Oh wait, I'm
supposed to say, &ldquo;I only read it for the articles.&rdquo; Yeah, that's
it. But really, the cover is very nicely done ... dare I say
tastefully silly with a large dash of cute?</p><p>&mdash;Lady Lilithlilith@serv.net</p><p>Thanks for all of your good work.</p><p>I'm a student assistant at SVC Mt.Vernon in
electronics&mdash;we've been doing a pilot Linux project since summer.
Part of my assisting deals with cookbook programming for hardware
types.</p><p>We'd like to order 12 reprints of the Python add-on from this
month's issue. Thanks.</p><p>&mdash;Kip Johnsonkiptech7@netscape.net</p><p>I'm no homophobe or fundamentalist wacko, but the supplement
cover is too much! The first thing I saw was some naked guy, and I
really thought it was someone's gay porn magazine put in my box by
mistake.</p><p>Seeing that the readership of the magazine is probably 90%
male, I would have preferred to see a naked female or at least one
in a thong bikini. :)</p><p>I'm not sure what to do with the supplement, other than put a
sticker on it so that others, who see it lying on my desk at work,
don't also think it's a gay porn magazine.</p><p>You crazy Linux guys!</p><p>Great magazine by the way, keep up the good work. And
remember&mdash;90% male readership.</p><p>&mdash;Neal Richternrichter@bridgernet.com</p><p>This is regarding your answers to letters published in the
May 2000 <i  >Linux Journal</i> defending the BSD
Daemon babes. In your response to Jordan Hubbard, you stated
regarding your past attendance at oil industry conventions:</p><p>&ldquo;I was offended that women were being used as sex objects
and that men were considered stupid enough to fall for such
tactics.&rdquo;</p><p>I am <span   class="emphasis"><em>offended</em></span> by people so full of
themselves and their elitist, high-minded social agenda that they
actually believe that those poor slobs at trade shows need someone
to be offended <span   class="emphasis"><em>for</em></span> them! I looked at the
pictures Jason posted on the web. What the hell is the problem? Get
over yourself!</p><p>Oh, but that's not all. When one of the actual models writes
in support of her role, you scold her for actually having
<span   class="emphasis"><em>fun</em></span> at the show:</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps when you start thinking of yourself as a woman
instead of a girl, you will understand...&rdquo;</p><p>But wait, there's more! What's on the cover of the Special
Supplement included with the issue? A completely naked man sitting
in a field. Oops, he's wearing a bowtie. The hypocrisy and irony
here is stifling.</p><p>Am I offended? Of course not! Worried about what my postal
carrier might think, but not offended; for me, for him or for
anyone, because I have a <span   class="emphasis"><em>life</em></span>.</p><p>We have a God-given and constitutionally protected right to
free speech in the U.S., though it's dwindling daily, a luxury some
of the readers of your magazine don't enjoy. Well, along with free
speech goes the right to offend and be offended, if you so choose.
Isn't America great? Go burn a bra or something...</p><p>Does this, like, totally squash my chances of ever getting
published in <i  >LJ</i>?</p><p>&mdash;Keith Brownbahalana@wt.net</p><p>I find the cover of the May 2000 Special Supplement to be in
excruciatingly poor taste, bordering on the obscene. It is not what
I expect of a semi-technical publication.</p><p>Cancel my subscription and refund the balance of the current
subscription payment.</p><p>&mdash;Stephen P. Molnar, Ph.D.smolnar@jadeinc.com</p><p>I must say that what arrived in my mail with the latest issue
of your magazine was quite a shock! To see a naked person on the
front of the mailing is very offensive to say the least. I have a
young daughter, and I wouldn't care for her to see such a sight.
Can you imagine if I took a copy of this to my workplace and left
it in plain view on my desk? I would be looking for another job,
because of sexual harassment! If your magazine must resort to these
methods to sell copies, then I will choose not to renew my
subscription, and I will move to a more professional
publication.</p><p>&mdash;Wesley Harmonagharmon@bellsouth.net</p><p>It's a bit difficult to take your shrill comments on sexism
seriously, since you are the editor-in-chief of a magazine that
just published an issue with a nude man on the cover.</p><p>&mdash;David Rodvolddrodvold@xaim.com</p><p>Loved the Python Special Issue cover. Keep up the good
work.</p><p>&mdash;Stephen Bachseb2t@jm.acs.virginia.edu</p></div></div>
