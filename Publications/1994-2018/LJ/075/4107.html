    I must say this issue ended up being more science than
    engineering, but perhaps that
    is not surprising considering my scientific leanings.

science than engineering, but perhaps that is not surprising
considering my scientific leanings. I thought about dropping the
word &ldquo;engineering&rdquo;, but since the S&amp;E focus has become
traditional, I decided to keep the word and wave my hands a bit.
Our main feature article is from Dr. Steve Mann of wearable
computer fame, and he has certainly pulled off a slick piece of
engineering in his videophone watch shown on our cover. Dr. Mann is
an accomplished photographer as well as inventor, and he gets
credit for the picture of the watch on the cover and the one with
his article. Dr. Mann certainly lives on the leading edge of this
technology, and we are happy to have another article from him to
keep us abreast of developments in wearable computers.
</p><p>For those readers who like to watch the skies, we have a
little of everything: satellite tracking, astronomy (even our
French chef, Marcel, has something to say on this one), storms and
lightning. Science articles can be found everywhere: in Features,
Forum and Strictly On-Line&mdash;enjoy!</p><p>Linley Gwennap becomes a regular columnist for us this month
with his column &ldquo;Linley on Linux&rdquo;, where he will keep us up to
date on some of the latest happenings in the electronics market for
Linux. This month, he tells us what's happening in the field of
voice recognition.</p><p>Speaking of columnists, Moshe Bar will also be joining us on
a regular basis to teach us about kernel issues in Kernel Korner,
and next month, we'll have an all-new column on cross-platform
programming written by Michael D. Crawford. Both should keep our
inner penguin quite happy.</p><p>&mdash;Marjorie Richardson, Editor in Chief</p><p><a href="4107s1.html" target="_self">Contents</a></p></div></div>
