Welcome, mes amis. Sit down and Fran&ccedil;ois will get you a
glass of wine. I must tell you, mes amis, that this month's special
issue on Science and Engineering has your chef feeling rather
pensive this evening.
</p><p>Some say that science has become rather dry lately. I find
this idea difficult to understand as we stand on the threshold of
unraveling the human genetic code, as new extra-solar planets are
discovered on an almost daily basis, as human spacecraft orbit
distant asteroids or gather cometary dust. If science has become
boring, then I would suggest it is the presentation of science that
has become dry. It's time to put some excitement back into the
study of life, the universe and everything else for that matter.
You are running Linux on your computer, non? Then it is time for
you, mes amis, to join the search for knowledge.</p><p>Linux's scalable nature and multi-user UNIX roots make it an
ideal platform for scientific work. Now everyone can have a
workstation for data collection and analysis, mathematical and
statistical modeling, and magnifique visualizations and
simulations. Even better, Linux's open source means that scientists
and engineers don't have to wait for some company to create the
tools they need. Add to that Linux's network-ready and network
friendly design, and you have the best environment not only for
research, but for collaboration with your peers. Scientists have
been using UNIX machines for years precisely for these reasons.
With Linux, things have gotten even better. When the going gets
tough and more horsepower is needed than can be generated by a
single machine, Linux is still the answer with low-cost Beowulf
clusters.</p><p>No longer do we, the general public, have to watch science
take place in the shadowy temples of distant laboratories. With the
power of Linux, everyone can be a participant. Proof of Linux's
prowess in the scientific world is as easy to find as a trip to the
<span   class="bold"><b>SAL</b></span> web site (Scientific
Applications on Linux) at
<a href="http://sal.kachinatech.com/index.shtml" target="_self">sal.kachinatech.com/index.shtml</a>.</p><p>For instance, you could start a collection of meteorological
data for your area. Using a program like
<span   class="bold"><b>Kweather</b></span>, you can monitor daily
weather events in your area such as temperature highs and lows or
precipitation. Kweather lets you graph the results so you can track
patterns over time. Are we truly experiencing a warming trend?
Memory is fragile, as I am often reminded when I comment on the
14-foot-high snowbanks of my childhood. With Kweather and
disciplined observation, you can know for sure. For your copy of
Kweather, pay a visit to J&lt;\#252&gt;rgen Hochwald's web site at
<a href="http://www.privat.kkf.net/~juergen.hochwald/linux/kweather/e_index.html" target="_self">www.privat.kkf.net/~juergen.hochwald/linux/kweather/e_index.html</a>.</p><p>But why, mes amis, would we want to concern ourselves merely
with the world around us when an infinite number of <span   class="emphasis"><em>other
worlds</em></span> seek to capture our curious imaginations, yet
another click of the mouse away? Besides being an aficionado of
wine, good food and heavenly sauces, your humble chef is also an
amateur astronomer. Ah, the mysteries of the universe!
Fran&ccedil;ois! More wine, please.</p><p>And so, the next item on our menu comes to us courtesy of
Aaron Worley, who brings us <span   class="bold"><b>Hitchhiker
2000</b></span> (HH2000). This wonderful program is a solar system
simulator, a digital orrery (Marcel's Collins defines it as a
&ldquo;mechanical model of the solar system in which the planets can be
moved at the correct relative velocities around the sun&rdquo;). Aaron
calls his site &ldquo;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Solar
System&rdquo;.</p><p>HH2000 is educational, surely; but mostly, the program is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>just plain fun</em></span>. The idea is that you have a
camera mounted on your celestial body of choice, any planet or any
moon in the solar system. You can choose comets and asteroids as
well. HH2000 comes with a healthy database of objects and the means
to add more by way of .CSV-format files (comma-separated values).
The effects are great, too. Depending on your angle of view, which
you can change by dragging your mouse around the view screen,
you'll notice the planets' night side is realistically in shadow.
Using the center mouse button (with my two-button mouse, the right
button did the job), you can zoom in or out by dragging the mouse
pointer up or down. With a single click, you can flip the viewing
from local orbit to deep space to an orbital view.</p><p>This eye on the sky uses
<span   class="bold"><b>OpenGL</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>Mesa</b></span> libraries (I used Mesa) for
3-D effects, both of which can be a little resource-hungry at
times. For maximum effect, you might want something punchier than
my 150MHz Pentium notebook. Still, even under this environment, I
found Hitchhiker to be plenty acceptable, which brings us to
requirements. HH2000 is built on GNOME libraries, so you'll either
need to be running GNOME or have the libraries loaded. If you are
like Fran&ccedil;ois and me, you probably have both desktop
environments loaded already. Before you can start exploring, you
will likely need one other piece of software (aside from OpenGL or
Mesa). Download the <span   class="bold"><b>gtkglarea</b></span>
libraries as well, and compile them. You will find links to all
these pieces on the Hitchhiker 2000 web site (see Resources).
Finally, pick up the HH2000 code. Binaries for glibc2.0 systems are
available, as is source code. With my Red Hat 6.2 system, I
compiled the program from source. The steps are simple:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xvfz hh2000-0.3-0.tar.gz
cd hh2000-0.3-0
 ./configure
make
make install
</pre><p>Running the program is done by typing
<b  >hh2000</b>. Now, sit back and enjoy the ride.
Careful on that gas pedal.
</p><p>For the truly serious astronomer, Elwood Downey brings us our
next item, and what a masterpiece this is.
<span   class="bold"><b>XEphem</b></span> is a star-charting package
that pretty much does it all. You start by identifying your
location (in my case, Toronto, Ontario) and clicking &ldquo;Update&rdquo;.
XEphem loads the appropriate latitude and longitude information for
your chosen city. If you need to be more accurate than &ldquo;next door
is okay&rdquo;, it is possible to enter that information manually as
well. Want to see what portion of the moon will be visible April
30, 2007? You can change the date through the calendar interface,
click &ldquo;Update&rdquo; once again, then select &ldquo;View&rdquo; and &ldquo;Moon&rdquo;. The
major planets are available at a click, as is a solar system view,
which can be animated and its angle of viewing changed.</p><p>Every program like XEphem needs a star chart. For many
amateur astronomers like myself, the planets are there as a warmup
to the real meat of observing, namely the stars and deep sky
objects. XEphem comes through with a fantastic star chart that
allows you to define many viewing options. For instance, you can
activate constellation lines, labels, define the types of objects
you would like to see (galaxies, open clusters, double stars, etc.)
or the minimum display brightness for these objects. XEphem also
lets you center in on an object and zoom in with a simple slide
control.</p><p>Exploring with XEphem is almost too much fun (as your humble
chef discovered while trying to finish this article). Mais,
qu'est-ce que c'est? That open cluster just below Cepheus looks
interesting. Would you like to see what it looks like through a
very powerful telescope? Center the object, click on &ldquo;View Image&rdquo;
and let the Space Telescope Science Institute and the Hubble Space
Telescope give you a close-up! Quite honestly, mes amis, the
features are just too numerous to mention. Here's another bonus.
Next time your friends who run that other operating system tell you
about all the great software you can't run on Linux, show them
XEphem. Then watch their faces when you tell them they can't have
it for the other OS.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4086f1.large.jpg"><img src="4086f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. M31&mdash;A XEphem Celestial
Close-up</p></div></div>
</p><p>XEphem is a commercial product, but it is also available as a
free download. I will tell you that the download version is still
fairly spectacular. The CD-ROM (commercial version), however, comes
with much more, including the full Hubble Guide Star Catalog (not
included in the download), a huge number of additional deep sky
objects, a full printed manual, and pre-built binaries for various
platforms. While you can connect to the Internet when you want
additional information such as a close-up (as in the previous
paragraph), you may find it well worth the price.</p><p>If you want to build XEphem yourself, you will also need
either Motif or the freeware LessTif from the Hungry Programmers
(do they know Chez Marcel is open, I wonder?). It is available at
<a href="http://www.lesstif.org" target="_self">http://www.lesstif.org/</a>
for download. Building LessTif is a matter of downloading
lesstif-current.tar.gz from the web site and following these
now-familiar steps:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xvfz lesstif-current.tar.gz
cd lesstif-current
 ./configure
make
make install
</pre><p>Next, you need to download your copy of XEphem. At the time
of this writing, the latest version was
<b  >xephem-3.2.3.tar.gz</b>. Building XEphem is a little
different than the usual &ldquo;configure&rdquo; and &ldquo;make&rdquo;. Here are the
steps:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf xephem-3.2.3.tar.gz
cd xephem-3.2.3/libastro
 ./xmkmf
make
cd ../GUI/xephem
 ./xmkmf
make
make install
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe4580.0xcdd420"></a>Happy Stargazing</h2></div></div><p>Finally, why not join in the greatest adventure of them all:
SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence? Your Linux
system is ideally suited to this task. Since you are running a true
multi-user system, it is possible to have a
<span   class="bold"><b>setiathome</b></span> process running in the
background (reniced so it doesn't draw too heavily on your system
resources). Who knows? You may be the one who decodes the first
signal from a distant civilization, like California&mdash;I joke,
seulement, non? Nevertheless, visit the SETI@home pages, register
as a SETI explorer, download your client and do your part in
exploring what may be humankind's most exciting new frontier. [You
can join the <i  >Linux Journal</i> Reader Group
too.]</p><p>There is no compiling or linking to do. You simply download
the client and untar it. For instance, I downloaded the 2.4 version
of the client. After untarring the bundle, I renamed the directory
(you will see why) and ran the client from there.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xvf setiathome-2.4.i386-pc-linux-gnu-glibc2.1.tar
mv setiathome-2.4.i386-pc-linux-gnu-glibc2.1
setiathome
cd setiathome
 ./setiathome
</pre><p>You can also launch the program from a crontab (as I do) and
just leave it running in the background. Here is my crontab entry:
<pre     class="programlisting">
0 * * * * cd /root/setiathome; ./setiathome\
-graphics&lt;\n&gt; -nice 19 &gt; /dev/null 2&gt; /dev/null
</pre>


Currently, SETI@home runs with a text-only client, but the latest
version also comes with an experimental &ldquo;screensaver mode&rdquo;
program called <span   class="bold"><b>xsetiathome</b></span>. The
<b  >-graphics</b> option in the crontab above is
required if you wish to use this experimental &ldquo;xsetiathome&rdquo; GUI
front end. Even before this GUI feature was added, Linux SETI users
were creating their own GUI clients to give setiathome a friendlier
face. One of my favorites is still
<span   class="bold"><b>TkSETI</b></span> from Rick Macdonald. You
can download TkSETI from
<a href="http://www.cuug.ab.ca/~macdonal/tkseti/tkseti.html" target="_self">www.cuug.ab.ca/~macdonal/tkseti/tkseti.html</a>.
One of the things I like about it is the ability to check my
progress against my other friends who run SETI@home. At this
moment, Chef Marcel's lovely wife, Sally, is way ahead, but
Fran&ccedil;ois is way behind.

</p><p>Oui, mes amis, it is that time again. I hope you enjoyed the
items on today's menu and that you will find yourselves exploring
other tasty avenues on your own. In the meantime, it is a clear
night and Chef Marcel has the telescope set up out back. If you
wish to join me, Fran&ccedil;ois will pour you a final glass of
wine and we will savor the Chablis while we search the heavens.
Join me again next time at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>. Bon
