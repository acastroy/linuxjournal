    This fully fuctioning prototype, designed and built by Steve
    Mann in 1998, was demonstrated in 1999, and later used to
    deliver a videoconference at ISSCC 2000.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2751580.0x28494a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Videophone wristwatches are a
science-fiction concept that is here today. The two key inventive
concepts that make this new technology possible are:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The use of a body-worn computer system (WearComp)
as a base station (see my article &ldquo;University of Toronto WearComp
Linux Project&rdquo; in <i  >LJ</i>, February 1999). Images
from the wristwatch are sent to the WearComp, and from the WearComp
to the Internet. Images received from the Internet are sent to the
wristwatch display (a full-colour VGA display). Full-colour
broadcast quality is transmitted at six to eight frames per second
using an experimental radio transmitter.</p></li><li><p>The use of a concomitant cover activity. Unlike
science fiction's vision of how a wristwatch videophone might work,
the camera points ahead rather than up at the user. In this way,
the wristwatch captures a video image of what the wearer is looking
at, rather than merely a picture of the wearer. Thus, taking a
picture or shooting a video may be masked by a concomitant cover
activity, such as checking the time or just resting an arm on a
countertop (see sidebar &ldquo;Concomitant Cover Activity&rdquo;).</p></li></ul></div>

<a href="3993s2.html" target="_self">Concomitant Cover Activity</a>
</p><p>A VGA screen is configured using XF86Config set to 640x480,
24-bit colour, allowing video to be displayed at the captured
resolution. The camera also operates at 640x480 resolution with
24-bit colour video capture at 30 frames per second. Images may be
processed or stored locally, or transmitted at a lesser rate. A
future version will transmit images at the recording speed of 30
frames per second rather than the current six to eight frames per
second limit imposed by the slow (2.4 megabits per second) radio
link.</p><p>The wristwatch provides a computer output screen with XF86,
upon which the viewfinder function operates, using one of the
windows or the root window. Graphics, including a transparent
oclock, appear over the top of the video viewfinder window.</p><p>Using the VideoOrbits image stabilizer, it takes pictures at
640x480, 24-bit colour, up to 5000 pixels across, in true 48-bit
colour (convertible to 24-bit colour pictures suitable for
high-quality prints). VideoOrbits is available under the GPL from
<a href="http://wearcam.org/orbits" target="_self">http://wearcam.org/orbits/</a>.</p><p>

</p><p>In Figure 1, Eric Moncrief is shown wearing the watch, and
Stephen Ross is pictured on the XF86 screen as a 24-bit true-colour
visual.</p><p>

</p><p>A SECRET function, when selected, conceals the
videoconferencing window by turning off the transparency of the
oclock, so that the watch then looks like an ordinary watch
(showing just the clock filling the entire 640x480-pixel screen).
The OPEN function cancels the SECRET function and opens the
videoconferencing session up again.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2751580.0x2849e48"></a>Technical Problems and How They Were
Overcome</h2></div></div><p>One technical problem that arises from running GNU/Linux
(GNUX) on a wristwatch is the input. We are experimenting with an
input pie menu system. A user can easily select eight directions of
the compass, but since this device has a clock face (at least, that
is its concomitant cover usage), a 12-position pie menu makes the
most sense.</p><p>The pie menu is described in &ldquo;A Comparative Analysis of Pie
Menu Performance&rdquo; by Callahan, Hopkins, Weiser and Shneiderman,
1988.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3993f3.large.jpg"><img src="3993f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. Wristwatch Videoconferencing
Menu</p></div></div>
</p><p>Figure 3 depicts a natural choice of pie menu for a
wristwatch display. The display is typically a computer screen with
480 pixels down and 640 pixels across, measuring approximately 0.7
inches on the diagonal. Upon the display is the image of a clock
face, superimposed on top of a video signal from the camera. Time
is displayed as a transparent xclock or oclock (or both, one
superimposed upon the other). Our modified oclock is available from
<a href="http://wearcam.org/gclock" target="_self">http://wearcam.org/gclock/</a>
and an exclusive or (EOR) oclock is under development to reduce
screen real estate use. In the figure depicted here, the time is
4:03.</p><p>The device truly looks like an ordinary wristwatch, although
one in which the hands are displayed electronically, because it is
in fact a wristwatch, among other things. It is natural for such a
wristwatch to have a circle displayed on the screen (this is a
feature of the original oclock), but unlike the oclock, it has
numbers displayed around the periphery of the circle. In this way,
it is easier to tell time, and the numbers may also be assigned a
secondary meaning (e.g., select &ldquo;0&rdquo; to stop recording, &ldquo;4&rdquo; to
kill all processes and halt the processor, &ldquo;7&rdquo; to wake up the
system from sleep mode, etc.).</p><p>Since humans are quite good at telling time, the numbers are
often missing from commercial wristwatches, and some wristwatches
do not even have markings for each hour. Instead, we often rely on
our heightened sense of visual acuity to discern the angle of the
hands upon the clock face. Thus, it is no surprise that the clock
menu is usable without paying much attention to the face of the
clock. The user just needs to stroke the face of the clock in the
direction desired.</p><p>The entry of numbers on a touch-sensitive clock face in the
context of the current invention may be done as vectors (e.g., with
no regard to location, only to direction). Thus, a stroke from left
to right is regarded as the number 3, regardless of where the
stroke begins or ends. A downward stroke (e.g., from top to bottom)
is regarded as the number 6 regardless of where the stroke begins
or ends, and so on.</p><p>Thus, telephone numbers can easily be entered into the
device, and similarly, an alphabet can be constructed much like the
alphabet of an automated DTMF (dual-tone multi-frequency) answering
system used for voice mail and the like in telephony.</p><p>Since there are 12 pushbuttons on a telephone and also 12
hours on a clock face, there can be a one-to-one correspondence
between the numbers of the clock face and those of the telephone.
The hours 10:00 and 11:00 are used for the symbols &ldquo;*&rdquo; and &ldquo;#&rdquo;
of the telephone touchpad.</p><p>The data entered by way of the clock face menu is typically
combined with the video recording made from the scene. The clock
face menu is sufficient for entering a department store manager's
name, which may be appended to the video file header, so that a
large database of recorded video may be navigated later using these
short text headers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2751580.0x284a478"></a>Going Further</h2></div></div><p></p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3993f4.large.jpg"><img src="3993f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. Block Diagram of Video Production
Facility</p></div></div>
</p><p>Due to direct contact between the wristwatch and the body,
the pulse (heart rate) as well as skin conductivity (sweatiness
index) of the wearer may be determined, and this information may be
appended to or recorded with the video signals. This may
facilitate, for example, a future search through all video in which
the wearer's heart rate exceeds a certain threshold. It has been
found that when a department store manager is dishonest with
respect to refund policies, or a clerk refuses to tell a customer
his name, the customer's heart rate increases dramatically, and the
customer often sweats profusely. Thus, this extra information can
later help locate moments of tension in a previously recorded
argument at the refund counter.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2751580.0x284a7e8"></a>Programs Developed for the Wristwatch
Videophone</h2></div></div><p><a href="3993s3.html" target="_self">Linaccess: GNUX for Low
Vision</a></p><p>The small size of the display required the development of an
X Window System configuration that was easy to read on a small
screen. This gave rise to the Linaccess project, where GNUX was
made accessible on low-vision systems. This project has two
distinct but closely related goals. First, to make GNUX accessible
to the visually challenged, or those suffering from low vision,
such as age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma or the like.
(Note that this project differs from the blinux project in the
sense that the goal of Linaccess is to use visual output, but to
make it more accessible to those with low vision.) Second, to make
GNUX usable on small screens, such as the wristwatch system. In
many ways, we're all suffering from low vision when we're trying to
read a 0.7-inch diagonal screen.</p><p><a href="3993s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>

      (mann@eecg.toronto.edu) is
      regarded by many as the inventor of the wearable computer
      (computing being distinct from special-purpose devices such as
      wristwatches and eyeglasses), and of the EyeTap video camera and
      reality mediator. He also built the world's first covert fully
      functional WearComp with display and camera concealed in ordinary
      eyeglasses in 1995, for the creation of his award-winning
      documentary &ldquo;ShootingBack&rdquo;. He is also the inventor of the
      wristwatch videophone, the chirplet transform, a new mathematical
      framework for signal processing, and of comparametric image
      processing. He is currently a member at University of Toronto,
      Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.</p></div>
