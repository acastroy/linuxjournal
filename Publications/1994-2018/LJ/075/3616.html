    Always look on the bright side of life and at a method for
    debugging CGI programs on the command line.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ed7580.0x1fcf818"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a
way in which you can let others from all over the world execute a
program that resides on your computer. CGI is dynamic, since it
runs in real time. You can decorate the CGI output with HTML (Hyper
Text Markup Language). Most of the time, CGI is used as a front end
for existing applications. CGI can be easy or complex, depending on
the complexity of your project. Most CGI developers know the
frustration which comes with debugging the CGI programs.
</p><p>We present a very simple and robust way of doing CGI
programming with Python. Debugging your CGI is easy, since you can
do it on the command line, and integrating existing applications to
work with CGI is just one step.</p><p>For our work, we chose Python, an object-oriented scripting
language with a clear syntax. It is very easy to use, widely
available and is free software.</p><p>Our intended audience is both experienced and novice CGI
programmers. We will use the words &ldquo;function&rdquo; and &ldquo;method&rdquo;
interchangeably. Note that CGI can be written in any computer
language.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ed7580.0x1fcfa28"></a>The GET and POST Methods</h2></div></div><p>There are two ways of invoking CGI programs: through a URL
with all data included, or by submitting HTML forms.</p><p>The two methods defined in HTTP to send your data to the CGI
are <span   class="bold"><b>GET</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>POST</b></span>. When the method is GET, the
CGI program gets the input from the <b  >QUERY_STRING</b>
environment variable. When the method is POST, the CGI program gets
the input from standard input (STDIN). In both cases, one has to
parse the input to obtain the input argument name,value
pairs.</p><p>CGI may or may not be complicated, but when you have a larger
application with many features, you might have problems in testing,
debugging, etc. This is true with all software projects. Debugging
becomes problematic with CGIs. For example, when the method is GET,
you have to set up environment variables
<b  >QUERY_STRING</b> and
<b  >REQUEST_METHOD</b>. When the method is POST, you
must set up <b  >REQUEST_METHOD</b> and
<b  >CONTENT_LENGTH</b> (number of bytes) to read from
standard input (STDIN). Moreover, when your program crashes, it is
not visible to your browser&mdash;you do not know what happened. The
only message you get in this situation is the error report made by
the web server.</p><p>You can use either of these methods (GET/POST) depending on
your need. If you will be sending more data to CGI, use the POST
method. When you have less data to be sent to CGI, use GET to put
all the data inside the URL. For example, on one line, type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;A HREF="/cgi/cgimodel.py?fun=DisplayFile&amp;fileName=
cgimodel.pycgimodel"&gt;cgimodel&lt;/A&gt;
</pre><p>With HTML FORMS (for POST method), the same would be
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;FORM METHOD="post" ACTION="/cgi-bin/cgimodel.py"&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE=hidden name=fun value=DisplayFile&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE=hidden name=fileName value=cgimodel.py&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE="cgimodel"&gt;
&lt;/FORM&gt;
</pre>


We all know the difficulties of and have adopted different styles
for debugging CGI programs. Our intention is to build CGI that does
not work in the traditional way, but like other programs which work
on the command line. This means you can test your CGI the way you
test any other program on the command line. When it works on the
command line, it is guaranteed to exhibit the same behavior on the
Web.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ed7580.0x1fcffa8"></a>The cgimodel Module</h2></div></div><p>Let us see how we can make life easier with
<span   class="bold"><b>cgimodel</b></span>, which lets you integrate
your existing application in an elegant way without much hassle.
Basically it consists of two modules:
<span   class="bold"><b>cgimodel.py</b></span> (see Listing 1) and
<span   class="bold"><b>cgidisp.py</b></span> (see Listing 2).</p><p><a href="3616l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.
cgimodel.py</a></p><p><a href="3616l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. cgidisp.py</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>cgimodel.py</b></span> is a wrapper to
Python's CGI module. It also encapsulates reading from the command
line, so there is no real difference in invoking from HTML FORMS or
a URL or the command line.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>CollectArgs</b></span> function in
the cgimodel.py module takes care of collecting arguments including
name,value parameters from CGI or the command line. On the UNIX
command line, you can supply the name,value parameters like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
-name1 value1 -name2 value2
</pre><p>or like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
name1 value1 name2 value2
</pre>


The same is true for both URL and FORMS.
</p><p>You do not have to modify anything in cgimodel.py. You just
have to use it. The main section of cgimodel contains the following
lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
d = Dispatcher()
parDict = CollectArgs(parDict)
print mime_html
fun=parDict['fun']
if not fun:
   print "usage: cgimodel -fun functionName"
   d.ShowAvailableFunc()
   TraceIt(parDict)
else:
   try:
      d.dispatch(fun,parDict)
   except:
      TraceIt(parDict)
</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>cgimodel.py</b></span> tries to call
the function you have given as an argument to the parameter
<b  >-fun</b>.
</p><p>When there is no such function available, it tells you the
names of functions that can be called. If there is an exception
(because of a syntax error, etc.) in the program, the exception
will be traced back and reported. You can use this feature to
e-mail the exception to yourself and make your CGI program more
stable.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ed7580.0x1fd0790"></a>The cgidisp Module</h2></div></div><p>The other module, cgidisp.py, is the one in which you have to
modify or insert an instance to the class
<b  >Dispatcher</b> for your application using one
argument, namely <b  >parDict</b>. For example, under
class <b  >Dispatcher</b>, if you define a method
like</p><pre     class="programlisting">
def cmd_myHello(self,parDict):
print "&lt;H1&gt;Hello&lt;/H1&gt;"
</pre><p>then this function is immediately available to the outside
world. You can call it on the command line this way:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cgimodel.py -fun myHello
</pre>


with URL (GET method)
<pre     class="programlisting">
cgimodel.py?-fun=myHello
</pre>


and with HTML forms as
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;FORM METHOD="post" ACTION="/cgi-bin/cgimodel.py&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE=hidden name=fun value=myHello&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE="Say Hello"&gt;
&lt;/FORM&gt;
</pre>


It's that easy!
</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>dispatch</b></span> method under
the class <b  >Dispatcher</b> is called from cgimodel.py
with one argument. This argument is the name of the function to be
executed. Here is the interesting part. After prefixing the
function name with the &ldquo;cmd_&rdquo; string, the dispatch method checks
to see if such a function is available with
<span   class="bold"><b>hassattr</b></span>. The Dispatcher maps the
command to the function and executes it. This way, you do not have
to use a lookup table to keep track of available functions. The
additional overhead of adding a new command to the new function is
not there; you just have to write the function and call it through
the command line. The functionality is already there. This kind of
pattern is possible with Python, since it is a highly dynamic
language.</p><p>Please note that when calling the method, we are not using
the prefix cmd_ of the method. This is explained later.</p><p>The main section of the <b  >Dispatcher</b> class
contains the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
class Dispatcher:
   def __init__(self):
      self.debug = None
   def dispatch(self, command,args=None):
      mname = 'cmd_' + command
      if hasattr(self, mname):
      method = getattr(self, mname)
         if not args:
            return method()
         else:
            return method(args)
      else:
         print "&lt;PRE&gt;" self.error(command)&lt;\n&gt;
         self.ShowAvailableFunc()
         print "&lt;/PRE&gt;"
   def cmd_Hello(self,parDict):
      print " Hello World !"
   def cmd_ShowDict(self):
      print "&lt;PRE&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;Debug Info:&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;HR&gt;"
      for k,v in parDict.items():
            print "%-30s :  %s " %(k,v)
      print "&lt;/PRE&gt;"
   def error(self,s):
      print " #&lt;B&gt;Error&lt;B&gt;: &lt;BB&gt;Function ( %s ) not available\n " %s
      return
</pre><p>All your parameters are available in the parDict dictionary
whether they are input from URL, FORM or command line&mdash;there is no
difference. You can check for their existence in this way:
<pre     class="programlisting">
if parDict['param']:
   print " yes ", parDict['param']
else:
   print " No "
</pre>


The <b  >None</b> object is returned when there is no
parameter, i.e., when you try to access an unspecified parameter.
</p><p>The instances inside the class <b  >Dispatcher</b>
are of two types: those that are prefixed by the &ldquo;cmd_&rdquo; string
are qualified for calling from outside; internal instances are not
visible outside. For example, the
<span   class="bold"><b>error</b></span> instance cannot be called
from CGI, but the instances
<span   class="bold"><b>cmd_Hello</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>cmd_ShowDict</b></span> can be called. This
convention is made to differentiate between the instances that are
for internal (used inside the class <b  >Dispatcher</b>)
and external (by cgimodel/cgidisp) use.</p><p>So, add a &ldquo;cmd_&rdquo; prefix to the instances you want to use
with CGI. For example, cmd_TopPage can be called with</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cgimodel.py -fun TopPage
</pre><p>on the command line and
<pre     class="programlisting">
cgimodel.py?-fun=TopPage
</pre>


will be the corresponding URL. The <b  >-fun</b> is
mandatory. This way, you can indicate which function you want to
call. Obviously, you can have as many functions as you want, and
they are CGI-ready. This is the exact requirement of larger CGI
projects.
</p><p>A couple of functions come with the module for free. The
function <span   class="bold"><b>DisplayFile</b></span> displays
colorized Python source code on the Web. This one relies on the
module <span   class="bold"><b>py2html.py</b></span>, available with
the standard Python distribution.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cgimodel.py -fun DisplayFile -fileName cgimodel.py
</pre><p>URL equivalent:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cgimodel.py?-fun=DisplayFile&amp;fileName=cgimodel.py
</pre>


Note the name=value and the <b  >&amp;</b> to separate
the name,value pairs&mdash;the traditional method of specification for
CGI.
</p><p>The method <span   class="bold"><b>cmd_ShowDict</b></span>
shows all dictionary items in the parDict dictionary and is useful
for checking whether you have supplied the correct
parameters.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ed7580.0x1fc7e90"></a>Adding Existing Modules to CGI</h2></div></div><p>Assume you already have this module:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/env python
#  testmethod.py
def  Method1(name1,name2,name3):
        print name1,name2,name3
if __name__ == '__main__':
     Method1('one','two','three')
</pre><p>Edit the cgidisp.py module, inserting the following method
under the class <b  >Dispatcher</b>:
<pre     class="programlisting">
def cmd_TestMeth(self,parDict):
   import testmethod
   name1 = parDict['name1']
   name2 = parDict['name2']
   name3 = parDict['name3']
   testmethod.Method1(name1,name2,name3)
</pre>


Now it is ready! You can call this on the command line by typing on
one line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cgimodel.py -fun TestMeth -name1 one -name2 two -name3 three
</pre>


or by URL (all on one line):
<pre     class="programlisting">
cgimodel.py?-fun=TestMeth&amp;name1=one&amp;name2=two&amp;name3=three
</pre>


or by FORMS:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;FORM METHOD="post" ACTION="/cgi-bin/cgimodel.py"&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE=hidden name=fun value=TestMeth&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE=hidden name=name1 value=one&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE=hidden name=name2 value=two&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE=hidden name=name3 value=three&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE="Run"&gt;
&lt;/FORM&gt;
</pre>


It would be much better if you could separate HTML text from CGI
modules, so that CGI looks thinner and more readable. You can use
the template modules (see Resources) to do this. The template
module keeps the text away from the CGI and has a page-paragraph
structure. Each CGI call can be associated with a page, and each
paragraph can be used to set up the view of your HTML page.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>cgimodel</b></span> can host any number
of applications. The redundancy of writing a CGI front end is no
longer necessary. Since many applications can be run by a single
cgimodel, logging information particular to each application can be
done for later analysis to improve server performance, stability of
each application, better service, etc. Currently, this can be done
with the log information generated by the web server.</p><p>With cgimodel.py, cgidisp.py and possibly the
<span   class="bold"><b>template.py modules</b></span>, you should
find writing and testing CGI programs easier.</p><p><a href="3616s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
