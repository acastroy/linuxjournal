a book for someone entirely new to computers. Rather, it was
written for one who might have prior experience as systems
administrator for another computer system, and is finally ready to
try Linux. In particular, the author compares it to Windows NT,
with some lovely diagrams showing 1) authentication, 2) network, 3)
boot process and 4) shutdown process. I used these comparison
diagrams to learn about NT servers (assuming they were correct)
because my only previous experience with NT was with the NT
workstation.</p><p>Enough about NT, however. This book was a delight to read.
Each chapter uses the classic teaching organization of an
introduction telling the reader what will be covered, the coverage
itself, and then a brief summary outlining what was covered, plus a
list of books for further reading. The overall structure consists
of five parts: Installing Linux, Single Host Administration,
Internet Services, Intranet Services and Advanced Linux
Networking.</p><p>The inside front cover of the book contains a &ldquo;functional
menu&rdquo; listing many common tasks that a system administrator has to
do and a reference to the chapter containing it. This implies that
each chapter is self-contained, although many of the later chapters
require information from earlier ones. I recommend reading it from
cover to cover. Also included with the book is a CD-ROM containing
the &ldquo;Publisher's Edition&rdquo; of the Red Hat Linux 6.1 distribution.
What this means is that the reader has a stripped-down version of
the distribution. URLs for Red Hat and other useful sites (such as
where to download &ldquo;ssh&rdquo;) are provided, so no one should be too
peeved.</p><p>Shah gives good descriptions of using RPM to grab packages to
install on one's working system, as well as complete illustrations
of downloading a tarball, unzipping (if necessary), untarring and
moving to a new directory. He then leads the reader thru the
process of finding a <span   class="bold"><b>Makefile</b></span>,
configuring, compiling and installing the package.</p><p>The description of setting up anonymous FTP is the most
complete I can recall reading in recent memory. It is not just a
cookbook recipe to follow, but also includes reasons to do things.
Shah even contrasts setting up FTP via NT and discusses the
relative security of each.</p><p>The Advanced Linux Networking section seemed too short. It
covers IP aliasing, packet filters, and ipchains. After discussing
the theory behind these, Shah gives concrete examples of how one
might set them up, including filtering out the &ldquo;ping of
death&rdquo;.</p><p>I did stop counting typos after a dozen or so, but most of
them will probably not detract from the reader's understanding. One
of the most annoying errors was on page 222; the text describing
DNS did not agree with Figure 12-1.</p><p>I think this book is well-written enough in explaining what
is behind much of Linux that it could likely reduce many of the
FAQs on Usenet newsgroups&mdash;that is, if everyone who had installed
or wanted to install Linux would read it. Of course, most Linux
newbies should read the HOWTOs, as well.</p><p>Overall, I think so highly of this book that I rate it in a
class with Nemeth, et al.'s <span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX System Administration
Handbook</em></span>. Or maybe I've reviewed too many &ldquo;... for
Dummies&rdquo; books. Well, I <span   class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> reviewed enough
of them and, yes, this book is good.</p></div></div>
