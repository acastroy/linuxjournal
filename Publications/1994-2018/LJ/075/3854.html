years now, I have read many technical books about web servers,
networking technologies and cryptography. These books discussed
different aspects of the technologies, but not a general view of
the Web as an entity. Moreover, I have always wanted to see a book
that could be read by somebody who is not a specialist. Rolf
Oppliger, the writer, works for the IT Security Group of the Swiss
Federal Office of Information Technology and Systems (BFI). He
teaches at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, and is also the
author of Internet and Intranet Security (Artech House, 1998) and
Authentication Systems for Secure Networks (Artech House, 1996).
Dr. Oppliger is the computer security series editor at Artech House
and received his M.Sc. and Ph.D. in Computer Science from the
University of Berne, Switzerland.</p><p>The book has about fifteen chapters. The main topics
discussed are HTTP authentication, proxy servers and firewalls,
cryptographic techniques, Internet security protocols and Secure
Socket layer (SSL). He then moves on to explain electronic payment
systems, certificate management and network access layer security
in detail . After that, he covers certificate management,
executable content and scripting languages, mobile code and
copyrights. In the last few chapters, the author touches on issues
like privacy protection, anonymous browsing and censorship on the
World Wide Web. Very few writers cover these subjects.</p><p>This book explains the different aspects of the Web, from
both the user point of view and system administrator or network
architect. It has plenty of references, web sites and pointers to
where information can be found. Very well-written, it states a list
that's almost like an index to technologies under discussion.
Whereas technologies such as encryption, security and Hyper Text
Transfer Protocol have copious sources of information, Electronic
Commerce does not have enough references. Rolf points out several
sources where information about e-commerce can be found. I
particularly liked the section on electronic commerce.</p><p>The book targets security for the most part; the discussion,
however, is restricted to IP-based networks. Other different
network protocols and technologies such as ATM and frame relay did
not get their share of the discussion. A deeper explanation of
virtual private networks would have enriched the book.</p><p>In conclusion, Rolf Oppliger presents what can be considered
a premier introduction to the end-to-end security model,
environment, tools, protocols, as well as privacy. It is not too
technical, and is thus appropriate for a broad audience. I
certainly recommend getting a copy; it is worthwhile
reading.</p></div></div>

      (wael@ieee.org) likes security and
      networks and enjoys code writing. He says that the greatest
      inventions come unexpectedly. That's why he prefers to think on the
      beach or while he is skating.</p></div>
