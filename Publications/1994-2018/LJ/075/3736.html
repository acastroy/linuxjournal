reading this book, it is still a well-written book that I recommend
without reservations. In the preface, the author explains why his
&ldquo;approach is not what one normally thinks of in connection with
books on data structures and algorithms.&rdquo; He rightly explains that
many books on data structures and algorithms have an &ldquo;academic
feel about them, and real details such as implementation and
application are left to be resolved elsewhere.&rdquo; Indeed, the
strength of this book is that instead of snippets of code, we are
presented with full programs as useful implementations.</p><p>The book is divided into three parts. Part I,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Preliminaries,</em></span> is the shortest. The author
doesn't try to teach the reader C, but instead provides a useful
review of some tricky topics such as the use of pointers (generic
pointers, function pointers casts and so on). He touches lightly on
recursion and reminds us what tail recursion is and why it is
efficient. There is also an overview of O-Notation for analyzing
algorithms. Some people might complain that the book doesn't go
into enough depth here, but if you view it as a companion text to
the more theoretical books from your college courses, then this is
just the right amount of information you need to continue on to the
implementations.</p><p>Part II, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Data Structures</em></span>, is where the
book starts to shine. There are chapters on linked lists, stacks
and queues, sets, hash tables, trees, heaps and priority queues and
graphs. Each chapter is broken down further. For example, the one
on linked lists discusses singularly linked lists, doubly linked
lists and circular lists. The implementation of linked lists is
where we first see the value of Loudon's good software engineering
practices. Public interfaces are documented in separate header
files, and private functions are static so they remain in file
scope.</p><p>Because programming styles tend to be personal, some readers
are likely to quibble with Loudon's coding conventions. However,
since he picked a style and applied it consistently, his code is
very clean and readable. For example, all structures have typedefs
and names, where the name of the structure is the name in the
typedef followed by an underscore. No shortcuts are taken, so
unlike many books that demonstrate the principles of a linked list
by using a data type of int, Loudon uses a pointer to void for a
generic implementation that can use any data type.</p><p>Part III is called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Algorithms</em></span>. The
chapters here are Sorting and Searching, Numerical Methods, Data
Compression, Data Encryption, Graph Algorithms and Geometric
Algorithms. While these chapters are not necessarily comprehensive
(and how could a one-volume book be comprehensive?), Loudon
presents some interesting topics that are <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
traditionally covered in books on algorithms, such as data
compression and data encryption. It was particularly interesting to
read about Lempel-Ziv compression, given the recent copyright
controversy with GIF graphics.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x231e580.0x2416c38"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>If you are a beginning programmer, you should first read a
book such as <span   class="emphasis"><em>The C Programming Language</em></span> by
Kernighan and Ritchie. If you are new to data structures and
algorithms, this is an excellent book with real implementations to
study. I would recommend it as a companion to the more traditional
academic books typically assigned in college courses. If you are an
intermediate to expert programmer, you might still appreciate this
book as a practical reference that won't bog you down in
theoretical detail, yet will allow you to get a program up and
running quickly.</p></div></div>
