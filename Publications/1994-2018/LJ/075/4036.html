    Take command of your log files by learning to handle those
    pesky logging daemons.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ad580.0x13a5558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Most UNIX-like systems since the early
days of BSD (and Linux certainly falls in this category) have
provided an API for application programs to send log messages to
the system, where they can be centrally handled at the discretion
of the system operator. Prior to the creation of this facility,
each application program would handle log messages in its own way.
Some would write to STDERR, some would write to a file, some would
write to a pipe, and some would offer all these options or more.
</p><p>As the number and complexity of applications on a system
grows, so, too, does the complexity of the system administrator's
job. Applications and their messages vary widely in their
significance to certain audiences. If a number of applications are
considered &ldquo;critical&rdquo; and their status is the system
administrator's responsibility, he does not want to search to find
out where and how every critical application logs its status.
That's where <span   class="bold"><b>syslogd</b></span> comes
in.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ad580.0x13a5710"></a>syslogd</h2></div></div><p>BSD added an API for logging to the standard library. Linux
also offers it. This API consists of three function calls:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#include &lt;syslog.h&gt;
void openlog( char *ident, int option, int facility)
void syslog ( int priority, char *format, ...)
void closelog( void )
</pre><p>An application that wishes to use syslogd for logging uses
these calls. A brief introduction to the use of this API can be
found in the sidebar &ldquo;Using the syslog API in Applications&rdquo;. The
one critical thing to know is that all messages from this API have,
at a minimum, a &ldquo;facility&rdquo; and a &ldquo;priority&rdquo;.
</p><p><a href="4036s1.html" target="_self">Using the syslog API in
Applications</a></p><p>Facilities include <b  >LOG_AUTHPRIV</b>,
<b  >LOG_CRON</b>, <b  >LOG_KERN</b>,
<b  >LOG_DAEMON</b> and so forth. These serve to identify
the &ldquo;system&rdquo; of origin. Note that it is not the &ldquo;program&rdquo; of
origin. For example, many different programs make up UUCP, but they
all log as <b  >LOG_UUCP</b>. The program name can be a
component of a log message, but this has nothing to do with the
facility. Some programs will log as more than one facility. For
example, <span   class="bold"><b>telnetd</b></span> might log failed
logins as <b  >LOG_AUTHPRIV</b>, but it might log other
messages as <b  >LOG_DAEMON</b>. &ldquo;Priorities&rdquo; specify
the &ldquo;severity level&rdquo; or &ldquo;level of attention&rdquo; the message
merits. We'll discuss these concepts at greater length throughout
this piece.</p><p>Our primary focus here is the tool that handles messages sent
via this API. While syslogd was originally developed for 4.2BSD, we
are going to cover the version that ships with most Linux
distributions today, specifically syslogd version 1.3-3. The
syslogd utility normally reads a configuration file at startup to
determine how messages are to be handled. This file, normally
/etc/syslog.conf, tells syslogd what to do with messages. Much of
the rest of this document will describe how to use syslog.conf to
customize logging on your system.</p><p><a href="4036l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>The syslog.conf file follows the more or less ubiquitous UNIX
convention of using the pound sign (#) as a comment character.
We'll use the sample syslog.conf file in Listing 1 for the rest of
our discussion. This is the &ldquo;out-of-the-box&rdquo; syslog.conf from my
Red Hat 6.1 laptop. I use other distributions personally, primarily
Debian and SuSE, but Red Hat seems to be the most popular. Let's
understand what this file is doing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ad580.0x13a5df0"></a>The Selector</h2></div></div><p>&ldquo;Rules&rdquo; in syslog.conf are a single line which consists of
two parts. The first is a &ldquo;selector&rdquo;, which specifies the set of
messages on which the rule is to act. The second is an action,
which specifies what is to be done with messages that match the
selector.</p><p>The selector is further divided into a &ldquo;facility&rdquo; and a
&ldquo;priority&rdquo;. Yes, these match the terms mentioned above in the
brief description of the syslog API. The facilities and levels have
numeric values and you can use them in the syslog.conf file, but it
is strongly advised that you do not. Symbolic values are supported,
and if the syslog API is ever changed, the numeric values might
change, whereas one would expect that the symbolic names would be
kept in alignment with any such change. So, be safe and use the
symbolic names.</p><p>The symbolic facility names are <b  >auth</b>,
<b  >authpriv</b>, <b  >cron</b>,
<b  >daemon</b>, <b  >kern</b>,
<b  >lpr</b>, <b  >mail</b>,
<b  >mark</b>, <b  >news</b>,
<b  >security</b> (same as <b  >auth</b>),
<b  >syslog</b>, <b  >user</b>,
<b  >uucp</b> and <b  >local0</b> through
<b  >local7</b>. The <b  >security</b> keyword
is deprecated in favor of the <b  >auth</b> keyword. The
<b  >mark</b> keyword is internal and should not be used
by applications; the syslogd program can be set to produce a
<b  >mark</b> periodically, which provides a means to
tell if you aren't getting messages, because none are being
generated or because syslogd has died. The rest of them correspond
to the major subsystems on your Linux box.</p><p>The priority keywords are <b  >debug</b>,
<b  >info</b>, <b  >notice</b>,
<b  >warning</b>, <b  >warn</b> (same as
<b  >warning</b>), <b  >err</b>,
<b  >error</b> (same as <b  >err)</b>,
<b  >crit</b>, <b  >alert</b>,
<b  >emerg</b> and <b  >panic</b> (same as
<b  >emerg</b>). The keywords <b  >error</b>,
<b  >warn</b> and <b  >panic</b> are deprecated
and should no longer be used.</p><p>A selector consists of a facility and a priority separated by
a period (.) character. Thus, <b  >mail.crit</b> would
select all critical messages from the mail facility.</p><p>The default behavior of the BSD syslog system is for all
messages of the specified or higher priority to be handled by the
action. The Linux syslogd does the same by default. It does have a
number of extensions, however.</p><p>You may use the asterisk (*) character to indicate all
facilities or all priorities (depending on whether it appears
before or after the period). Thus, the
<b  >authpriv.*</b> line in the example sends all
messages from the authentication facility, no matter what priority,
to /var/log/secure. You may use the special priority
<b  >none</b> to indicate that <span   class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span>
messages from a given facility rule are to be acted upon by the
action.</p><p>You may specify multiple facilities with the same priority in
a single rule by listing the facilities separated by commas (,)
before the period. Thus, the <b  >uucp,news.crit</b> line
sends all critical and above priority messages from the mail and
news facilities to /var/log/spooler.</p><p>You may specify multiple selectors for a single action by
listing them separated by the semicolon character. Each subsequent
selector may override the previous. Thus, the
<b  >*.info;mail.none;news.none;authpriv.none</b> rule
would send all messages above <b  >info</b> priority from
all facilities (because of the *) to /var/log/messages,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>except</em></span> messages from mail, news or
authentication facilities (because of the <b  >none</b>
keyword and because rules are applied in order, left to
right).</p><p>More than one rule may apply to a message! It is important to
understand that a message will be sent to <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>
actions with matching selectors. It is not as if a message, once
matched, is gobbled up. That means you can store a single message
to multiple actions if it is matched by multiple selectors.</p><p>There are more priority selection extensions. First, remember
that the default is to select messages of the stated or higher
priority. You may also reverse the sense with the exclamation mark.
So, for example, a rule such as</p><pre     class="programlisting">
*.!err   /var/log/routine
</pre><p>would send all messages <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> at
<b  >err</b> or above to /var/log/routine (a file meant
for &ldquo;routine&rdquo; messages, apparently).
</p><p>You can also restrict the selection to an exact priority
instead of to a given priority and higher with the equals sign (=).
Thus, the <b  >news.=crit</b> rule out of our example
would send only critical messages from the news facility to
/var/log/news.crit.</p><p><a href="4036t1.html" target="_self">Table 1</a></p><p>At this point, you may be a little foggy on what, precisely,
these various priorities are meant to denote. Let's shed a little
light on that issue by looking at the &ldquo;Priorities&rdquo; table.</p><p>A classic problem in designing software is trying to figure
out an empirical way to tell the difference between a condition you
would report as <b  >crit</b> vs.
<b  >alert</b>. In fact, it is sometimes even more
difficult to decide when you should use <b  >notice</b>
vs. <b  >warn</b>. You won't find total agreement between
packages on what level of message falls where. One difficulty lies
in trying to decide who will read the log. An
<b  >emerg</b> to a business unit might be only a
<b  >warn</b> to a network administrator.</p><p>There's no one good answer to this problem. At least, by
creating a uniform method for handling program messages, we avoid a
proliferation of different reporting systems, and some conventions
have emerged with time. Because we are able to match a message to
more than one action, we can output messages to targeted audiences.
For example, we could report all <b  >auth</b> messages
to the security department's home directory, but the system
administrator might choose to receive only those of &ldquo;crit&rdquo; or
above. The syslogd lets us do this.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ad580.0x139e150"></a>The Actions</h2></div></div><p>There are some drawbacks to using the &ldquo;out-of-the-box&rdquo; Red
Hat syslog.conf file. Notably, all &ldquo;actions&rdquo; are basically to
write to local files. The syslogd d&aelig;mon can do much more than
that. Let's take a look at actions next.</p><p>Actions may send messages to any of these
destinations:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A regular file: this is what you see in our
example. This is simply the name of a file to which the message is
appended.</p></li><li><p>A named pipe: named pipes, or FIFOs (First-In,
First-Out), are a simple form of inter-process communication
supported by Linux and many other operating systems. You create a
named pipe with the <span   class="bold"><b>mkfifo</b></span>
command; a FIFO appears in the file system. You tell syslogd it is
writing to a FIFO instead of a file by putting a pipe character (|)
in front of the FIFO name. Take a look at the man pages for mkfifo,
both the command and the system call, and the man page for
&ldquo;fifo&rdquo;, which is a description of the special file. You read and
write FIFOs with the normal file system calls. A description of
FIFO programming is beyond our scope, although I can highly
recommend the excellent book <span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX Network
Programming</em></span> by W. Richard Stevens, from
Prentice-Hall.</p></li><li><p>A terminal or console: if you specify a tty device
(such as /dev/console), syslogd is smart enough to figure out that
it is a device, not a file, and treat it accordingly. This can be
fun if you have a dumb terminal&mdash;you can send all your messages to
/dev/ttyS1 (for example) and get all your messages on the terminal
screen while you work on your console. This is state-of-the-art
1970 technology&mdash;I love glass teletypes!</p></li><li><p>A remote machine: now <span   class="emphasis"><em>this</em></span> is
the true power. Let's assume you have many Linux boxes on a
network. Do you want to log in to each to check their logs for
certain conditions? Of course you don't, and you don't have to.
Optionally, the syslogd listens on the network for messages as
well. Just put an at sign (@) followed by the host name:</p></li></ul></div><pre     class="programlisting">
        *.crit   @sol.n0zes.ampr.org
</pre><p>This last will send all critical and above messages from all
facilities to sol.n0zes.ampr.org, which will then apply its own
syslog.conf file to save them. Syslogd will not forward a message
received from the network to another host: in other words, you get
one and only one hop. This may be overridden with switches when
syslogd is invoked. It seems like a reasonable thing to do, since
even the possibility of circular message routing would be enough to
scare the dickens out of any network administrator.
</p><p>This capability has obvious advantages for centralized
logging and log scanning for security violations and so forth. It
also has obvious deficiencies. It is hard to maintain a complete
log when your network is down. Take advantage of the fact that you
can route messages to more than one action by making sure every
message finds its way to a file before you send it to remote
logger.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ad580.0x139e7d8"></a>A List of Users</h2></div></div><p>One feature that newer users of Linux may not be aware of is
console messaging. This isn't used very much any more, thanks to
<span   class="bold"><b>talk</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>irc</b></span> and other much more
interactive &ldquo;chat&rdquo; mechanisms with much cleaner user interfaces.
You can, however, send a text message to any user logged in to your
system with the &ldquo;write&rdquo; command. This is an unpopular facility
for several reasons. First, in today's windowed environments, a
user probably has many &ldquo;terminals&rdquo; active and it is hard to know
which one to write to. Second, if they are in the middle of some
intense full-screen activity (such as editing a large file with
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span>) and you blast a bunch of text
at them that confuses their editor and screws up their screen, they
will not like you very much. Most Linuxes I have seen default their
users to messaging being off. This facility uses the same ability
to write to a user's console to send messages directly to their
screen. Just put a comma-separated list of user names as the
action. Save this for truly critical stuff. You might turn this on
to try it, but I bet you will turn it off again before too
long.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ad580.0x139e9e8"></a>Everyone Logged In</h2></div></div><p>There is a similar method, called
<span   class="bold"><b>wall</b></span> or write-to-all. This lets
you send a text message to every user logged in to the system. The
superuser can do this whether you choose to accept messages or not.
This is how <span   class="bold"><b>shutdown</b></span> sends its
warning messages. You can have syslogd send a message to everyone
by this mechanism by specifying an asterisk (*) as the action. Save
this one for the most dire of dire messages, if you must use it.
This should be used for warning of an impending crash&mdash;anything
less is probably overkill.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ad580.0x139eba0"></a>klogd</h2></div></div><p>At this point, you may be asking what
<span   class="bold"><b>klogd</b></span> has to do with any of this.
The answer to that is simple. The kernel can't call the syslog API.
There are many reasons for this. The core reason, and the simplest
to understand, is that Linux actually provides two completely
separate APIs. The more familiar one is the &ldquo;standard library&rdquo;
used by user-space applications; this is the one that uses syslog.
The other API is normally not used by applications: this is the
kernel API code that runs as part of the kernel. This code needs
services similar to those offered by the applications programming
interface, but for numerous technical (and a few aesthetic)
reasons, it is not possible for kernel code to use the
application's API. For this reason, the kernel has its own entirely
separate mechanism for generating messages. The klog d&aelig;mon,
klogd, is an application process that ties the kernel messaging
system to syslogd. Actually, it can also dispatch kernel messages
to files, but most configurations use the klogd default, which is
to prepare kernel messages, and in essence, resubmit them through
syslog.</p><p>There is quite a bit more to klogd if you wish to delve into
the depths, but for the purposes of this article, it is sufficient
to know that klogd feeds kernel messages to syslogd, where they
appear to be coming from the <b  >kern</b>
facility.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>syslogd</b></span> provides a powerful
and simple mechanism for managing messages from multiple
applications in a highly configurable manner. Its ability to
&ldquo;demultiplex&rdquo; the message stream makes using the syslog API an
appealing option for applications developers, and I would encourage
you to consider using that API in your own programs.</p><p><a href="4036s2.html" target="_self">syslogd Switches</a></p><p><a href="4036s3.html" target="_self">Signals</a></p></div></div>
