server market peaked, according to Netcraft. Through the second
half of 1999, its shares slipped. So did Microsoft IIS, but as the
end of the year came around, Microsoft suddenly surged up and
Apache began to reciprocate in the downward direction.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4105cf1.large.jpg"><img src="4105cf1.jpg"></a></div><p>But that was for just one month. Since the first of the
millennium, Apache has been steadily going up to reach record
shares, and IIS has mostly gone down, relatively speaking (although
in absolute numbers, it has been going up). In April, Apache
tallied 8,812,960 web servers for a 1.48% increase to 61.53%.
Microsoft was second, with 1,047,890 servers and a .16 percent
increase to 21.09% of the total. Third was iPlanet, the family of
Sun Solaris and Netscape servers sold by Sun. iPlanet servers may
trail the leaders, but not among the top-traffic sites. &ldquo;The
Solaris/Netscape combination does particularly well amongst
high-transaction SSL sites such as the leading retail brokerages,
Charles Schwab, E*Trade, and Fidelity,&rdquo; Netcraft says.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eff580.0x1ff7ef8"></a>TUCOWS DOWNLOADS</h2></div></div><p>After two months at the number-one position in Tucows

out Mandrake's 31%. Number three Corel returned to its February
level at 13%. Number four Phat Linux lost half its share in one
month, from 10% to 5%. Debian also continued to drop, from 6% in
February to 3% in April. SUSE, FreeBSD and Slackware were each tied
and holding about even at 3%. Caldera continued dropping, to just
2%. Everybody else held even at 1% or less. (Note: While February

NATURAL-LANGUAGE MARKET
</p></div></div><p>The natural-language market is under attack by several
competitors. The most successful of these so far is &ldquo;Ask Jeeves&rdquo;
(ASKJ), Ask.com. Ask Jeeves is a proprietary, closed-source
natural-language understanding program for the Web. ASKJ attracted
much attention in 1999 with its wildly successful IPO. In addition
to AskJ, there are a number of smaller, pre-IPO companies entering
the highly valued natural-language market. Forecasters see
fantastic growth in applications such as intelligent customer
service agents, web-based help desks and customer support.</p><p>In October 1999, AskJ and Microsoft announced a partnership
to provide natural-language-based help desk support for Windows
2000. ASKJ is to ALICE what MS is to Linux. Although the markets
are much smaller, the stage is set for a classic
open-source/closed-source battle.</p><p>Ask Jeeves has been a magnet for lawsuits. In 1999, the
company was sued by MIT professors Boris Katz and Patrick Winston,
among others, who claim they have the patent on web-based
natural-language transactions. The ALICE project has been operating
&ldquo;under the radar&rdquo; in stealth mode, under the GPL.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eff580.0x1ff82c0"></a>ALICE</h2></div></div><p>I am the leader of a group of Linux-like contributors to a
gigantic open-source software project. Our goal is the creation of
artificial intelligence using the natural language program ALICE. I
developed AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) along with
a crude interpreter, and released both under the GNU GPL. The
result was the now-predictable, open-source magic: a team of
developers from around the world began improving the code, creating
content and providing an immense user base.</p><p>ALICE won the Loebner Prize, an annual &ldquo;Turing Test&rdquo;, in
2000, for being the computer program ranked closest to a human. The
ALICE and AIML developers have created a library of content,
numerous on-line documentation sites and versions of the ALICE
server in both Java and C/C++. AIML is &ldquo;platform-independent,
language-independent&rdquo; in the sense that ALICE robot scripts run on
different interpreters on different operating systems. There are
interfaces for HTTP, CGI, IRC, plain text, GUIs and even voice I/O
(input/output).</p><p>There are at present four companies in various stages of
starting up around ALICE and AIML technology. The developers have
moved on to embedded system applications, intelligent customer
service agents and entertainment applications of the technology. We
are trying to stay &ldquo;above the fray&rdquo; and &ldquo;not pick winners and
losers&rdquo;, as this technology begins to attract the attention of
&ldquo;suits and other real-world investors.&rdquo; Does this story sound
familiar?</p><p>&mdash;Dr. Richard Wallace, dr.wallace@mindspring.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eff580.0x1ff84d0"></a>STRICTLY ON-LINE,

been rising exponentially. Recently, many of these devices have
contained Internet-enabled functionality and even web-browsing
software. If you run a popular Internet site, it's possible someone
has tried to visit it with such a device and seen nothing! In this
column, I'll show you how to configure the Apache web server to
handle these requests successfully.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eff580.0x1ff8cb8"></a>WAP/WML</h2></div></div><p>The leading Internet implementations on hand-held devices
have used the Wireless Application Protocol, WAP. The idea comes
from the wireless industry and is based on existing Internet
technologies such as IP. Just as I use HTML for my site, mikal.org,
I'll now use WML for people visiting my site over WAP.</p><p>WML stands for Wireless Markup Language and is based on XML.
Similar to HTML, WML is read and interpreted by a browser built
into a WAP-enabled device.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eff580.0x23f1068"></a>Apache WML Setup</h2></div></div><p>The first thing I need to do to handle wireless visitors is
inform Apache about the MIME type I'll be using. I add MIME support
for the WML file extension to the default MIME type configuration
file in this way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
text/vnd.wap.wml      wml
</pre><p>This file includes a definition of the most commonly known
MIME types. On my file system, it's located in the /etc/mime.types
directory.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eff580.0x23f1220"></a>Catching Wireless Visitors</h2></div></div><p>I want to catch anyone visiting my web site with a wireless
browser and send them to my WML page, welcome_wap_user.wml (listing
below). For this purpose, I'll use Apache's powerful
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_rewrite</b></span> module, available in
version 1.2 or later. By using this, I can rewrite requested URLs
on the fly based upon rule conditions. It's possible that
mod_rewrite isn't already compiled into the server; check the
Apache documentation for instructions on doing this. Specifically,
I'll be looking at the <b  >HTTP_USER_AGENT</b> and
<b  >HTTP_ACCEPT</b> environment variables to check for
known WAP browsers.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE wml PUBLIC "-//WAPFORUM//DTD WML 1.1//EN"
     "http://www.wapforum.org/DTD/wml1_1.1.xml"&gt;
&lt;wml&gt;
     &lt;card&gt;
     &lt;p&gt; Welcome to mikal.org! &lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;/card&gt;
&lt;/wml&gt;
</pre><p>The mod_rewrite module can be used by placing the appropriate
directives, shown below, in the httpd.conf Apache configuration
file. Line 1 turns on the
<span   class="bold"><b>RewriteEngine</b></span>. Jorrit Waalboer,
from the WML programming list at eGroups.com, provided me with the
<span   class="bold"><b>RewriteCond</b></span> statements in lines
2-7 to determine if the client is a WAP browser. If RewriteCond
matches one of these browsers,
<span   class="bold"><b>RewriteRule</b></span> tells Apache to serve
welcome_wap_user.wml.
<pre     class="programlisting">
RewriteEngine on
# Catch most WAP browsers
RewriteCond %{HTTP_ACCEPT} text/vnd\.wap\.wml [OR]
# WinWAP, WAPjag
RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} wap [OR]
# Nokia emulators (sdk)
RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} 7110
# Rewrite!!
RewriteRule ^[\./](.*)$  /welcome_wap_user.wml [L]
</pre>


To activate these changes, I'll need to restart Apache.
</p><p>I can now check my site, but I'll need a WAP-compatible
device. For this purpose, I use the UP.Simulator, part of UP.SDK,
the Phone.com software development kit. The UP.SDK supports
development of WAP services written in WML. After a quick check
with the UP.Simulator, I see my site is now WAP-aware and ready for
the future of wireless Internet.</p><p>For additional information on WAP, WML or building a WAP

Linux</h2></div></div><p>On May Day (May 1, 2000), a point when financial markets
seemed to have lost faith in Linux as a &ldquo;Big Trend&rdquo; (many Linux
stocks lost most of their value in the first third of the year), a
big chunk of change&mdash;$37 million, to be exact&mdash;was invested in
Lineo, Inc., which is emerging as the leading embedded Linux
software company.</p><p>In an interesting twist, the list of sources for that money
includes only three venture capital firms. Another fourteen
investors are actual or potential Lineo customers, including
familiar names like Motorola, Samsung, Mitsubishi, Compaq, Citrix
and Acer&mdash;plus a raft of motherboard, laptop and component
manufacturers in Taiwan, Japan and Korea. These include DaiShin
Information and Communications, First International Computer,
Global Alliance, Hikari Tsushin, Arima and Mitac International. The
VCs are Egan Managed Capital, J&amp;W Seligman and Astoria Capital
Partners.</p><p>These manufacturers are <span   class="emphasis"><em>players</em></span>. &ldquo;There
is a substantial interest on the part of major manufacturers in
embedded Linux. And we include in that category a variety of
software, hardware, components and solutions for embedded systems.
These are smart companies that got to where they are by knowing how
both to predict market trends and sense what's happening right
now,&rdquo; says Lyle Ball, Vice President of Communications and
co-founder of Lineo.</p><p>The most interesting aspect of this news is that it appears
to be something unusual: a very traditional &ldquo;Old Economy&rdquo; play.
These manufacturers want to put Linux in their products, not just
score a big run-up off a Lineo IPO (which, of course, they
certainly wouldn't mind).</p><p>To get the significance of this, consider the
little-discussed fact that every company has two markets: one for
its goods and services and another for itself. Before the New
Economy showed up, the latter market was extremely secondary, even
for publicly traded companies. Value was <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>.
Growth mattered, but there was no prevailing imperative to take a
new company public or to run its value up to the sky overnight. But
the get-big-quick imperative of the New Economy led to biased
business conversations over the last several years, so that talk
about investment has drowned out talk about the fundamentals of
business. And this kind of talk has been endemic to the commercial
Linux market ever since Red Hat went public last August and
instantly branded Linux as the hot &ldquo;growth topic&rdquo; of 1999.</p><p>But this investment appears to be operating on the Old
Economy imperative, which is to support product and service
innovation. At least, this is what a long and manufacturer-heavy
list of investors suggests.</p><p>What this also suggests is that Linux will probably expand
from servers to appliances and other embedded devices more quickly
than it will spread to clients&mdash;although there is no shortage of

expect to have them as demand spreads,&rdquo; Ball says. He expects
demand to spread quickly because Linux's advantages lower the
threshold of adoption well below competing operating systems,
including familiar embedded operating systems such as Wind River,
ISI and QNX. These virtues include open OS code source, an in-place
worldwide support infrastructure, a huge developer community and
base of knowledge, and relatively easy code adaptation across
different processor types. &ldquo;Linux is the Switzerland of Internet
connectivity and infrastructure,&rdquo; Ball adds. &ldquo;You're not making
NetWare Internet-savvy here. You're taking something that's
extremely native to the Net and adapting it to a whole class of new
Net-native devices. And you're doing it with the support of many
thousands of Linux developers, all over the world, vs. relatively
few working for proprietary embedded OS companies. That's why our
community is bypassing the development schedules that have
determined embedded growth in the past, and accelerating a whole
new schedule. We're putting the embedded Linux growth schedule on
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Internet time</em></span>.&rdquo;
</p><p>Linus Torvalds seems to agree. He has been talking up
embedded Linux for a while now, and his employer, Transmeta, has
more or less the same intentions as Lineo.</p><p>&ldquo;Now you can imagine a Coke machine as a Net-native
connected device,&rdquo; Ball says. This might have been thinkable in
the old embedded processing world, but it wasn't do-able because
there wasn't a Net-native embedded OS that was familiar to the very
people who are doing the most to deploy the Net itself. Now that
it's do-able, it will be very interesting to watch the progress
across Lineo's list of market categories.</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div></div>
