Edition</p></li><li><p>Ordering Information: http://www.caldera.com/,

Windows applications I need, so I was very excited when Wabi showed
up on my doorstep.</p><p>Wabi is a Sun Microsystems application that runs Windows 3.1,
3.11 and Windows for Workgroups on Unix. You must have one of these
versions of Windows to install into the framework which Wabi sets
up on your Linux system. Then you must install the Windows
applications you wish to run into this environment. While Wabi
itself is installed into /usr/opt, the Windows installation must be
repeated in the home directory of each user who wishes to use Wabi.
All of the directory structures created by these installations
reside inside the Linux directory structure and are accessible from
Linux.</p><p>The Linux version of Wabi 2.2 has been licensed and published
by Caldera and retails for $199. Information about how to obtain
Wabi is on the Caldera Web site: http://www.caldera.com/; you can
also call them at 800-850-7779 and 801-269-7012
(international).</p><p>In addition to its own Caldera Network Desktop, Caldera
claims Wabi also runs on the Red Hat, Debian and Slackware Linux
distributions which have a 1.2.13 or later kernel and the X Window
System (X11R6). A local or networked CD-ROM drive is required for
installation. A minimum of 10MB free disk space plus space for
Microsoft Windows and its applications is required on your hard
drive.</p><p>Sun Microsystems has certified an impressive array of 16-bit
Windows applications to run under Wabi 2.2 (see
<a href="2076s1.html" target="_self">Sidebar</a>).</p><p>Many other 16-bit Windows applications can also work under
Wabi, they just have not been tested and certified by Sun
Microsystems and Caldera. For example, I installed QuickBooks 3.0,
and so far, it appears to work perfectly.</p><p>Wabi enables most of the capabilities of Windows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Cut, copy and paste between Windows
applications</p></li><li><p>Access DOS-formatted diskettes</p></li><li><p>Run in enhanced mode</p></li><li><p>Object linking and embedding (OLE) between Windows
applications</p></li><li><p>Dynamic data exchange (DDE) between Windows
applications</p></li><li><p>Network installation and use of applications</p></li><li><p>Windows Sockets networking</p></li></ul></div><p>And, because it is running in a Linux environment, you can
also do the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Cut, copy and paste between MS Windows applications
and X Window System applications</p></li><li><p>Access network file systems transparently</p></li><li><p>Use on X terminals</p></li><li><p>Run on one system, display on another system</p></li><li><p>Run additional applications simultaneously on your
desktop</p></li><li><p>Share serial and parallel ports</p></li><li><p>Support multiple simultaneous users on one
system</p></li><li><p>Access NetWare files and directories</p></li></ul></div><p>Functions not supported include those requiring Microsoft
Windows networking, special device drivers and DOS commands. In
particular, Wabi does not support:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>MIDI or AVI</p></li><li><p>Full NetWare IPX/SPX connectivity</p></li><li><p>Shared Wabi Windows directories</p></li></ul></div><p>Inside the attractive Caldera Wabi box, I found the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Wabi for Linux</em></span> CD-ROM and 180-page indexed
user's guide. As a Linux user hardened to the perusal of man pages,
READMEs and HOWTOs, I found the high quality of the illustrated
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Wabi for Linux User's Guide</em></span> a refreshing
change. Free software is a great concept, but I can easily justify
spending a little money for a product with documentation that so
clearly communicates what needs to be done.</p><p>Installing Wabi on my Linux box with Red Hat 4.0 and 2.0.27
kernel went without a hitch. When I first tried to bring it up,
however, my system immediately froze. This sent me scurrying to
find support, and I was very pleased with what I found. Caldera
provides technical support by e-mail and also hosts two mailing
lists, &ldquo;caldera-users&rdquo; and &ldquo;wabi-caldera&rdquo;. All three of these
support sources got back to me quickly with solutions. In this
case, I had to uninstall Metro-X 3.1.2, which does not work with
Wabi, and replace it with XFree86-3.2. I also found I needed to
temporarily disable the font server by calling Wabi with
<b  >wabi -fs</b>.</p><p>My next challenge was to install Windows: Wabi did not show
me an <b  >A</b> drive. A quick query to &ldquo;wabi-caldera&rdquo;
disclosed I had to expand the permissions on my floppy drive
with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#chmod 666 /dev/fd0
</pre><p>Windows easily installed from floppy diskettes after this.
Wabi also permits installation via network.
</p><p>In my case, configuring Wabi was extremely easy. The defaults
were adequate to access DOS files in the Wabi-created
<b  >C</b> drive. And the PostScript driver provided by
Windows enabled me to immediately print to my Hewlett-Packard 5MP
printer.</p><p>For more advanced configuration, Wabi provides the Wabi
Configuration Manager, which is extremely easy to use and
accessible from an icon inside the Control Panel. Here, the user
can attach Windows diskettes, drives, COM ports and printers to
their Linux equivalents both on a stand-alone Linux box or across a
network. The user can also attach a DOS emulator to the Program
Manager RUN command, the MS-DOS prompt and DOS applications
launched from icons under Windows.</p><p>As the DOSEMU 0.63.1.66 packaged with Red Hat 4.0 does not
allow parameters and Wabi requires them, I was not able to test
this capability beyond a simple MS-DOS prompt. Using DOSEMU, I am
able to access DOS through my virtual consoles and xterms quite to
my satisfaction, so not being able to launch DOS applications from
Windows icons is, for me, no great loss.</p><p>With that behind me, I noticed my keyboard did not work in
the necessary way. For example, ALT-ESC and DEL did not work. By
this time I had fortunately found an additional area of
support&mdash;the Wabi area of the Caldera Web site at
http://www.caldera.com/. I found documentation of the keyboard
problem with XFree86-3.2 here, and I quickly implemented the
fix&mdash;placing XkbDisable in my XF86Config and enabling .Xmodmap in
my user directory.</p><p>One real nuisance is Wabi's creating sticky windows, which
appear on every virtual X screen. As I was writing this review,
some of the subscribers on the caldera-wabi list were working on a
solution by launching Wabi under Xnest using the following
script:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Xnest :1 -geometry 790x572+0+0 &amp;
exec wabi -display :1 +fs
</pre><p>This works great to control the display of Wabi inside one
window. I was unfortunately not able to use it, because Xnest does
not inherit the keyboard controls from the original server but
instead implements its own internal default, which is not the IBM
keyboard needed for Microsoft Windows. So for now, when Wabi is
running, it hogs all of the X screens.
</p><p>Installing the four Windows applications I wanted to
use&mdash;Aldus PageMaker 5.0, Aldus FreeHand 3.10, Excel 4.0 and
QuickBooks 3.0&mdash;was quite routine, and they all appear to work
quite well.</p><p>Wabi is fast. I don't notice any difference in speed between
Windows running under Wabi and Windows running under DOS. Cut and
paste between Windows and X Windows applications works as
advertised. Hey, I really like this! Microsoft Windows has never
been so much fun.</p><p>In concept, Wabi aims toward a seamless integration of
Microsoft Windows with Linux. In practice, there are loose ends in
the implementation. For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The File Manager sets up a diskette for formatting,
then gives an error. Formatting of diskettes must be done in
Linux.</p></li><li><p>The floppy drives must be world-writable in order
for Wabi to function, thus compromising system security over a
network.</p></li><li><p>Wabi's sticky windows reduce the functionality of X
while Wabi is running.</p></li><li><p>Neither Wabi nor Microsoft Windows provides support
for the popular 600-dpi printers. I had to settle for a 300-dpi
PostScript driver. These are only minor nuisances, and workarounds
are easy to come by. There are major factors, however, which limit
Wabi's marketability:</p></li><li><p>Not enough applications are supported.</p></li><li><p>Support for only 8-bit displays limits Wabi's
usefulness for layout and desktop publishing even though the
applications do run.</p></li><li><p>Microsoft is currently deploying 32-bit Windows 97,
putting Wabi two generations behind.</p></li><li><p>I feel the price point for Wabi is too high for the
Linux market. A $49.95 Wabi would make a lot of money for Caldera.
Wabi, at $199, may sit on the shelf until Linux is a mainstream
operating system in corporate America.</p></li></ul></div><p>If you want or need the versatility and convenience of
running Microsoft Windows from your X desktop over your network,
you don't mind paying for the privilege, and your expectation is
not <span   class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> great, I would suggest buying Wabi for
Linux now. You won't be disappointed. It is a professionally
conceived and executed product with many nice touches that will
give you solid performance. If you like the idea of Wabi but want
to run 32-bit applications, drive a 24-bit display, or use mostly
applications not on the certified list, wait for Wabi 3.0. The Unix
version is scheduled for release in July. Neither Sun nor Caldera
has yet announced a Linux version. However, I will be very
surprised if we don't see one. Let us hope Sun and Caldera will see
the light and begin to price Wabi for the mass market Linux is
rapidly becoming.</p></div></div>
