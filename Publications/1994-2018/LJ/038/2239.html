    This article is a description of the steps required to boot
    the Linux kernel. While this kind of information is not relevant
    to the system's functionality, it is interesting to see how the
    different architectures bring up the system.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b32580.0x1c2a240"></a></h2></div></div><p>A computer system is a complex machine,
and the operating system is an elaborate tool that orchestrates
hardware complexities to show a simple and standardized environment
to the end user. When the power is turned on, however, the system
software must boot the kernel and work in a limited operating
environment. I describe here the booting process of three
platforms: the old-fashioned PC and the more fully featured Alpha
and SPARC platforms. The PC is covered in more detail, since it is
still in more widespread use than other platforms, and also because
it's the most tricky platform to bring up. No code will be shown,
as assembly language is unintelligible to most readers, and each
platform has its own.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b32580.0x1c2a348"></a>The Computer at Power-On</h2></div></div><p>In order to be able to use the computer when the power is
turned on, the processor begins execution from the system's
firmware. The firmware is &ldquo;unmovable software&rdquo; found in ROM; some
manufacturers call it the Basic Input-Output System (BIOS) to
underline its software role, some call it PROM or &ldquo;flash&rdquo; to
stress its hardware implementation, while others call it
&ldquo;console&rdquo; to focus on user interaction.</p><p>The firmware usually checks the hardware's functionality,
retrieves part (or all) of the kernel from a storage medium and
executes it. This first part of the kernel must load the rest of
itself and initialize the whole system. I don't deal with firmware
issues here with the kernel code, which is distributed with
Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b32580.0x1c2a4a8"></a>The PC</h2></div></div><p>When the x86 processor is turned on, it is a 16-bit processor
that sees only 1MB of RAM. This environment is known as &ldquo;real
mode&rdquo; and is dictated by compatibility with older processors of
the same family. Everything that makes up a complete system must
live within the available megabyte of address space, i.e., the
firmware, video buffers, space for expansion boards and a little
RAM (the infamous 640KB) must all be there.</p><p>To make things difficult, the PC firmware loads only half a
kilobyte of code and establishes its own memory layout before
loading this first sector. Whatever the boot media, the first
sector of the boot partition is loaded into memory at the address
0x7c00, where execution begins. What happens at 0x7c00 depends on
the boot loader being used; we examine three situations here: no
boot-loader, LILO, Loadlin.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b32580.0x1c2a608"></a>Booting zImage and bzImage</h2></div></div><p>Even though it's rare to boot the system without a boot
loader, it is still possible to do so by copying the raw kernel to
a floppy disk. The command <b  >cat zImage &gt;
/dev/fd0</b> works perfectly on Linux, although some other
Unix systems can do the task reliably only by using the
<b  >dd</b> command. Without going into detail, the raw
floppy image created by <b  >zImage</b> can then be
configured using the <b  >rdev</b> program.</p><p>The file called <b  >zImage</b> is the compressed
kernel image that resides in <b  >arch/i386/boot</b>
after either <b  >make zImage</b> or <b  >make
boot</b> is executed&mdash;the latter invocation is the one I
prefer, as it works unchanged on other platforms. If you built a
&ldquo;big <b  >zImage</b>&rdquo; instead, the kernel file created
is called <b  >bzImage</b> and resides in the same
directory.</p><p>Booting an x86 kernel is a tricky task because of the limited
amount of available memory. The Linux kernel tries to maximize
usage of the low 640 kilobytes by moving itself around several
times. Let's look at the steps performed by a
<b  >zImage</b> kernel in detail; all of the following
path names are relative to the arch/i386/boot directory.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The first sector (executing at 0x7c00) moves itself
to 0x90000 and loads subsequent sectors after itself, getting them
from the boot device using the firmware's functions to access the
disk. The rest of the kernel is then loaded to address 0x10000,
allowing for a maximum size of half a megabyte of data&mdash;remember,
this is the compressed image. The boot sector code lives in
bootsect.S, a real-mode assembly file.</p></li><li><p>Then code at 0x90200 (defined in setup.S) takes
care of some hardware initialization and allows the default text
mode (video.S) to be changed. Text mode selection is a compile-time
option from 2.1.9 onwards.</p></li><li><p>Later, all the kernel is moved from 0x10000 (64K)
to 0x1000 (4K). This move overwrites BIOS data stored in RAM, so
BIOS calls can no longer be performed. The first physical page is
not touched because it is the so-called &ldquo;zero-page&rdquo;, used in
handling virtual memory.</p></li><li><p>At this point, setup.S enters protected mode and
jumps to 0x1000, where the kernel lives. All the available memory
can be accessed now, and the system can begin to run.</p></li></ul></div><p>The steps just described were once the whole story of booting
when the kernel was small enough to fit in half a megabyte of
memory&mdash;the address range between 0x10000 and 0x90000. As features
were added to the system, the kernel became larger than half a
megabyte and could no longer be moved to 0x1000. Thus, code at
0x1000 is no longer the Linux kernel, instead the &ldquo;gunzip&rdquo; part
of the <b  >gzip</b> program resides at that address. The
following additional steps are now needed to uncompress the kernel
and execute it:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>head.S in the compressed directory is at 0x1000,
and is in charge of &ldquo;gunzipping&rdquo; the kernel; it calls the
function <span   class="emphasis"><em>decompress_kernel</em></span>, defined in
compressed/misc.c, which in turns calls
<span   class="emphasis"><em>inflate</em></span> which writes its output starting at
address 0x100000 (1MB). High memory can now be accessed, because
the processor is definitely out of its limited boot
environment&mdash;the &ldquo;real&rdquo; mode.</p></li><li><p>After decompression, head.S jumps to the actual
beginning of the kernel. The relevant code is in ../kernel/head.S,
outside of the boot directory.</p></li></ul></div><p>The boot process is now over, and head.S (i.e., the code
found at 0x100000 that used to be at 0x1000 before introducing
compressed boots) can complete processor initialization and call
<b  >start_kernel()</b>. Code for all functions after
this step is written in C.</p><p>The various data movements performed at system boot are
depicted in Figure 1.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2239f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. System Boot Data Map
</p></div></div><p>The boot steps shown above rely on the assumption that the
compressed kernel can fit in half a megabyte of space. While this
is true most of the time, a system stuffed with device drivers
might not fit into this space. For example, kernels used in
installation disks can easily outgrow the available space. Some new
method is needed to solve the problem&mdash;this new method is called
<b  >bzImage</b> and was introduced in kernel version
1.3.73.</p><p>A <b  >bzImage</b> is generated by issuing
<b  >make bzImage</b> from the top level Linux source
directory. This kind of kernel image boots similarly to
<b  >zImage</b>, with a few changes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>When the system is loaded to address 0x10000, a
little helper routine is called after loading each 64K data block.
The helper routine moves the data block to high memory by using a
special BIOS call. Only the newer BIOS versions implement this
functionality, and so, <b  >make boot</b> still builds
the conventional <b  >zImage</b>, though this may change
in the near future.</p></li><li><p>setup.S doesn't move the system back to 0x1000 (4K)
but, after entering protected mode, jumps instead directly to
address 0x100000 (1MB) where data has been moved by the BIOS in the
previous step.</p></li><li><p>The decompresser found at 1MB writes the
uncompressed kernel image into low memory until it is exhausted,
and then into high memory after the compressed image. The two
pieces are then reassembled to the address 0x100000 (1MB). Several
memory moves are needed to perform the task correctly.</p></li></ul></div><p>The rule for building the big compressed image can be read
from Makefile; it affects several files in arch/i386/boot. One good
point of <b  >bzImage</b> is that when kernel/head.S is
called, it doesn't notice the extra work, and everything goes
forward as usual.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b32580.0x1c2ba50"></a>Using LILO</h2></div></div><p>Most Linux-x86 users don't boot the raw kernel image from a
floppy; instead they boot LILO from the hard disk. LILO replaces
part of the process outlined above so that it can load a Linux
kernel that is scattered throughout a disk. This capability allows
the user to boot a kernel file from a file system partition without
using the floppy.</p><p>In practice, LILO uses the BIOS services to load single
sectors from the disk, and then it jumps to setup.S. In other
words, it arranges the memory layout in the same way as bootsect.S;
thus, the usual booting mechanism can complete painlessly. LILO is
also able to handle a kernel command line, and this is a good
reason by itself to avoid booting the raw kernel image.</p><p>If you want to boot a <b  >bzImage</b> with LILO,
you must use LILO version 18 or later. Earlier versions of LILO are
not able to load segments into high memory, an ability that is
needed when loading big images in order for
<b  >setup.S</b> to find the expected memory
layout.</p><p>The main disadvantage of LILO is that is uses the BIOS to
load the system. This forces the kernel and other relevant files
into the first 1024 cylinders of disks to be accessible to the
BIOS. When using the PC firmware, you discover how old-fashioned
the architecture actually is.</p><p>Even if you don't run LILO, you can enjoy the documentation
files distributed with LILO's source code. They document the boot
process on the PC and explain how to handle (almost) every
conceivable situation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b32580.0x2023fb8"></a>Using Loadlin</h2></div></div><p>If you want to boot your operating system from another
operating system, Loadlin is the tool for you. This program is
similar to LILO in that it loads the kernel from a disk partition
and then jumps to setup.S. It is different from LILO in that it not
only faces the BIOS restrictions, but also must dispose of an
established memory layout without compromising the system's
stability. On the other hand, Loadlin is not restricted to a half
kilobyte length because it is a complete program file, not a boot
sector. Version 1.6 and later of Loadlin are able to load big
images.</p><p>Loadlin can pass a command line to the kernel and is,
therefore, as flexible as LILO. Most of the time, you'll write a
linux.bat file to pass a full-featured command line to Loadlin when
calling the <b  >linux</b> command.</p><p>Loadlin can be used to turn any networked PC into a Linux
box. All that is needed is a kernel image equipped for mounting the
root partition via NFS, Loadlin and a linux.bat containing the
correct IP numbers. You need a properly configured NFS server as
well, but any Linux machine can fill that job. For example, the
following command line turns a PC (alfred.unipv.it) into a
workstation:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
loadlin c:\zimage rw nfsroot=/usr/root/alfred \
nfsaddrs=193.204.35.117:193.204.35.110:193.204.35.254:255.255.255.0:alfred.unipv.it
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b32580.0x2024220"></a>More of It</h2></div></div><p>The code is not as easy as I described&mdash;it must deal with a
lot of details, such as bringing around the kernel's command line,
keeping an eye on the boot technique being used, and so on. The
curious reader can look in the source file to learn more and to
read the authors' comments. There's a lot of information in the
comments, and they are often funny to read.</p><p>I personally feel most users will never need to touch the
boot code, because things are much more interesting when the system
is up and running. At those times you can exploit all the features
of your processor and all the available RAM without going mad with
processor-level issues.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b32580.0x2024380"></a>Booting an Alpha</h2></div></div><p>The Alpha platform is much more mature than the PC, and its
firmware reflects this maturity. My experience with Alpha is
limited to the ARC firmware, which is the most widely used.</p><p>After performing the usual detection of devices, the firmware
displays a boot menu that lets you choose which file to boot. The
firmware can read a disk partition (though only a FAT partition),
so you actually boot a &ldquo;file&rdquo; without the need to hack boot
sectors and build maps of disk blocks.</p><p>The file booted is usually linload.exe, which in turn loads
MILO (the &ldquo;Mini Loader&rdquo;). In order to boot Linux through the ARC
firmware, you must have a small FAT partition on your hard drive to
store linload.exe and milo files. The Linux kernel doesn't need to
access the partition unless you upgrade MILO, so FAT support can be
safely left out of your Alpha kernel.</p><p>Actually, the user can exploit different options. The ARC
boot menu can be configured to boot Linux by default, and MILO can
be burnt in flash memory in order to get rid of the FAT partition.
However, whatever you do, you end up with MILO running.</p><p>The MILO program is a stripped-down version of the Linux
kernel. It has all of the Linux device drivers and a file system
decoder; unlike the kernel it doesn't have process control and does
include Alpha initialization code. This tool can set up and enable
virtual memory and can load a file from either an
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ext2</em></span> partition or an
<span   class="emphasis"><em>iso9660</em></span> device. The &ldquo;file&rdquo; in question is
loaded to virtual address 0xfffffc0000300000 and then executed.
This virtual address is also the one where the Linux kernel runs;
however, it's unlikely you'll ever load anything but Linux. One
exception is the <b  >fmu</b> (&ldquo;flash management
utility&rdquo;) program used to burn MILO in flash
ROM&mdash;<b  >fmu</b> is compiled to execute from the same
virtual address whence the kernel runs, and it is distributed with
MILO.</p><p>It's interesting to note that MILO also includes a small 386
emulator and some of the PC BIOS functionality. This is needed in
order to execute self-initialization code found on many ISA/PCI
peripheral boards (PCI boards, though claiming to be
processor-independent, use Intel machine code in their ROM
images).</p><p>Since MILO does all of this, what is left to the Linux
kernel?&mdash;very little, actually. The first kernel code to execute in
Linux-Alpha is arch/alpha/kernel/head.S, and all it does is set up
a few pointers and jump to start_kernel(). Actually, kernel/head.S
for Alpha is much shorter than the equivalent x86 source
file.</p><p>If, for some reason, you don't wish to run MILO there is an
alternative, though not a practical one. In arch/alpha/boot you'll
find the source for a &ldquo;raw&rdquo; loader that is compiled by issuing
<b  >make rawboot</b> from the top level Linux source
directory. This utility can load a file from a sequential region of
a device&mdash;either floppy or hard disk&mdash;using the firmware's &ldquo;call
backs&rdquo;.</p><p>In practice, the raw loader accomplishes a task similar to
the one bootsect.S performs for the PC platform&mdash;it forces a copy
of the kernel to either a raw floppy or a raw hard disk partition.
There's no real reason to use this technique&mdash;it is quite hairy and
lacks the flexibility MILO offers. I personally don't know if it
still works; the &ldquo;PALcode&rdquo; used by Linux is exported by MILO and
is different from the one exported by the ARC firmware. The PALcode
is a library of low-level functions used by Alpha processors to
implement low-level hardware management like paging; if the current
PALcode implements different operations than the software expects,
the system won't work.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b32580.0x2024900"></a>Booting a SPARC Station</h2></div></div><p>Bringing up a SPARC computer is similar to booting the Alpha
on the user side, and similar to booting the PC on the software
side.</p><p>The user sees that the firmware loads and executes a program,
which in turn is able to retrieve and uncompress a file found on a
disk partition. The &ldquo;program&rdquo; in question is called SILO, and it
can read files from either a <span   class="emphasis"><em>ext2</em></span> or a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ufs</em></span> partition. Unlike MILO (like LILO), SILO
is able to boot another operating system. There is no need for this
ability on the Alpha, because the firmware can boot multiple
systems; once you run MILO, you have already made your choice (the
right choice&mdash;Linux).</p><p>When a SPARC computer boots, the firmware loads a boot sector
after performing all the hardware checks and device initialization.
It's interesting to note that Sbus devices <span   class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span>
platform independent, and their initialization code is portable
Forth code rather than machine language bound to a particular
processor.</p><p>The boot sector loaded is what you find in /boot/first.b in
your Linux-SPARC system and is a bare 512 bytes. It is loaded to
address 0x4000, and its role is retrieving /boot/second.b from disk
and writing it to address 0x280000 (2.5 MB); this address was
chosen because the SPARC specifications state that at least 3MB of
RAM must be mapped at boot time.</p><p>The second-stage boot loader then does everything else. It is
linked with libext2.a to access system partitions and can thus load
a kernel image from your Linux file system. It can also uncompress
the image, since it includes the inflate.c routine from the
<b  >gzip</b> program.</p><p>The routine second.b accesses a configuration file called
/etc/silo.conf, similar in shape to lilo.conf. Since the file is
read at boot time, there's no need to re-install the kernel maps
when a new kernel is added to the boot choices. When SILO shows its
prompt, you can choose any kernel image (or other operating system)
specified in the silo.conf file, or you can specify a complete
device/path name pair to load a different kernel image without
editing the configuration file.</p><p>SILO loads the disk file to address 0x4000. This means the
kernel must be smaller than 2.5MB; if it is larger, SILO will
refuse to overwrite its own image. No conceivable Linux-SPARC
kernel currently exceeds that size, unless it was compiled with
<b  >-g</b> to have debugging information available. In
this case, the kernel image must be stripped before being handed to
SILO.</p><p>Finally, SILO performs kernel decompression and/or remapping
to place the image at virtual address 0xf0004000. The code that
takes over after SILO is finished is arch/sparc/kernel/head.S. The
source includes all the trap tables for the processor and the
actual code to set the machine up and call
<b  >start_kernel()</b>. The SPARC version of head.S is
quite big.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b32580.0x2024e80"></a>start_kernel and On</h2></div></div><p>After architecture-specific initialization is complete, the
init/main.c program takes control of whichever processor you are
using.</p><p>The <b  >start_kernel()</b> function first calls
<b  >setup_arch()</b>, which is the last
architecture-specific function. Unlike other code, however,
<b  >setup_arch()</b> can exploit all the processor's
features and is a much easier source file to deal with than those
described earlier. This function is defined in the kernel/setup.c
code under each architecture source tree.</p><p>The <b  >start_kernel()</b> function then
initializes all the kernel's subsystems&mdash;IPC, networking, buffer
cache and so on. After all initialization is done, these two lines
complete the code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
kernel_thread(init, NULL, 0);
cpu_idle(NULL);
</pre><p>The <b  >init</b> thread is process number 1: it
mounts the root partition, executes <b  >/linuxrc</b> if
<b  >CONFIG_INITRD</b> has been selected at compile time,
and then executes the <b  >init</b> program. If
<b  >init</b> can't be found, <b  >/etc/rc</b>
is executed. In general, using <b  >rc</b> is
discouraged, since <b  >init</b> is much more flexible
than a shell script in handling system configuration. As a matter
of fact, version 2.1.21 of the kernel removed the
<b  >/etc/rc{/}</b> option, making it obsolete. If
neither <b  >init</b> nor <b  >/etc/rc</b> will
run or if they exit, <b  >/bin/sh</b> is executed
repeatedly (but 2.1.21 and later kernels will execute it only
once). This feature only exists as a safeguard in case the
<b  >init</b> file is removed or corrupted by mistake. If
you remove a.out support from the kernel without recompiling your
old <b  >init</b>, you'll enjoy having at least a shell
running after reboot. The kernel has no more tasks to do after
spawning process number 1, and all other functions are handled in
user space by <b  >init</b>, <b  >/etc/rc</b>
or <b  >/bin/sh</b>. And process 0? The so called
&ldquo;idle&rdquo; task executes <b  >cpu_idle()</b>, a function
that calls <b  >idle()</b> in an endless loop.
<b  >idle()</b> in turn is an architecture-dependent
function that is usually in charge of turning off the processor to
save power and increase the processor's lifetime.
