    Designing our CGI quiz to be more robust and to include
    error checking.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a58580.0x1b503a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Two months ago, we began to write a
simple multiple-choice quiz engine in Perl. Virtually all of that
column covered the nuts and bolts of the engine&mdash;creating the
<b  >QuizQuestions</b> object and the programs using that
object to create a simple multiple-choice quiz, as well as to check
its answers.
</p><p>The end result was two CGI programs. The first,
askquestion.pl, creates an instance of
<b  >QuizQuestions</b> and uses it to select a random
question, which is then turned into an HTML form that is sent to
the user's browser.</p><p>The other program, checkanswer.pl, accepts the submission of
this form from the user, and then checks that the user chose the
correct answer.</p><p>Even more important than the <b  >QuizQuestions</b>
object is the &ldquo;quiz file&rdquo;, an ASCII text file containing three
different types of items:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Comments beginning with a hash character (#).
Comments are ignored by the quiz engine. Therefore, questions must
not begin with <b  >#</b>, but we can use
<b  >#</b> inside a question or answer without having to
fear that the end of the question will be chopped off.</p></li><li><p>Whitespace, such as spaces, tab characters and
carriage returns that are also ignored. We allow for whitespace
because users will undoubtedly separate items in the quiz file with
blank lines, for example, and we need not require them to comment
out the lines.</p></li><li><p>Question records containing the questions and
answers for the quiz. Each record contains the text of a question,
followed by each of the four possible answers, and then by an A, B,
C or D, indicating the correct answer. The fields in each record
(question, answer 1, answer 2, answer 3, answer 4 and the correct
answer) are separated by tab characters, and so, neither questions
nor answers can contain tabs.</p></li></ul></div><p>A sample quiz file that tests users on their knowledge of the
GNU Emacs text editor is shown in <a href="2224l1.html" target="_self">Listing
1</a>. While this may not be obvious on paper, it is important
to remember that the fields within each line are separated by tab
characters, not by spaces.</p><p>One of the main flaws with the original quiz system was that
it depended on the ability of users to create quiz files that
conformed to these standards. Moreover, the
<b  >QuizQuestions</b> object didn't check for errors in
format when reading the quiz file.</p><p>This month we take a look at how we can make the quiz system
a bit more robust, while staying within the confines of the CGI
standard.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a58580.0x1b50b88"></a>Checking for Errors</h2></div></div><p>First, we will modify the definition of
<b  >QuizQuestions</b> so that it checks for errors while
loading the quiz file. What sorts of errors could we have it check
for? One simple test ensures that each non-commented,
non-whitespace line contains exactly six fields (one question, four
answers and one answer key). Lines having a different number of
fields will be flagged as errors.</p><p><a href="2224l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>The original version of <b  >QuizQuestions.pm</b>
is shown in Listing 2. To make sure that the quiz file is correct,
we have to modify methods that read from the quiz file&mdash;which in
this particular case, means the <b  >new</b> method, the
constructor for <b  >QuizQuestions</b>. We can create a
new instance of <b  >QuizQuestions</b> with the following
line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $quiz = new QuizQuestions("emacs");
</pre><p>Before we decide how to check for errors in the quiz file, we
should think about how errors should be reported. If a method
within <b  >QuizQuestions.pm</b> discovers an error in
the quiz file, should the method produce an HTML response for the
user to see? Should it fail, calling <b  >die</b> and
indicating the error in the HTTP server's error log? Should it do
both?
</p><p>I suggest that <b  >QuizQuestions.pm</b> should not
use either of these options, since both violate the abstraction
that we have created. <b  >QuizQuestions</b> is an object
for manipulating questions within a quiz file easily, and does not
&ldquo;know&rdquo; whether it is being used from within a CGI program.
Methods within <b  >QuizQuestions</b> should report
errors, when they occur, to the calling program rather than
directly to the user.</p><p>If we were using a language such as Java that includes an
extensive exception-handling mechanism, this would be a perfect
time to use it; we don't want the calling routine to receive a
return value that could be misinterpreted as a legitimate value for
<b  >$quiz</b>. At the same time, we do want to return
information about any errors that have occurred.</p><p>Perl's exception handling isn't as extensive as that of Java.
Luckily, though, Perl does permit assigning various types of data
to the same operator. In this case, if the file contains no errors,
<b  >new</b> returns a new instance of
<b  >QuizQuestions</b>. If there are errors in the file,
<b  >new</b> returns a string that consists of the line
containing the error. It could simply return 0 in such cases;
however, since we have the flexibility to return any scalar value,
it is better to return a value that encodes more
information.</p><p>Now that we have determined that error messages will be sent
back to the calling method, let's think about how to determine
which lines in the quiz file contain errors. Fortunately, this is a
simple problem to solve, since each non-comment, non-blank line of
a quiz file should contain exactly six tab-separated fields. Thus,
if a line is not a comment, is not an empty line and does not
contain six fields, it must be an error and should generate an
error value.</p><p>Here is the loop in the existing version of
<b  >new</b> inside the <b  >QuizQuestions</b>
object that loads the quiz file from disk:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Loop through the question file while (&lt;QUESTIONS&gt;)
{
   next if /^#/;      # Ignore comment lines
   next unless /\w/;  # Ignore whitespace lines
   chomp;
   # Add this question to the list.
   $questions[$counter++] = $_;
}
</pre><p>To check for errors, we simply break each line into its
constituent fields using the <b  >split</b> operator and
count the number of list elements. If that number is not six, then
we have a syntax error to be reported by returning the offending
string to the calling routine. Here is a modified version of the
above loop that implements this strategy:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# Loop through the question fil,e
while (&lt;QUESTIONS&gt;)
 {
    next if /^#/;      # Ignore comment lines
    next unless /\w/;  # Ignore whitespace lines
    chomp;
    # Split the line across tabs
    my @list = split(/  /);
    # Check to make sure that there are six fields
    if ($#list != 5)
    {
        # Return the line containing the error
        return $_;
    }
    else
    {
        # Add this question to the list
        $questions[$counter++] = $_;
    }
}
</pre>


This code is the same as the original <b  >while</b> loop
with only one difference. Before adding the current line,
<b  >$_</b>, to <b  >@questions</b> (an array
containing questions and answers from the quiz file), we split it
at each tab, creating a list with one element per field in the quiz
file. If the list contains six elements, then this line of the quiz
file is acceptable, and we continue with the original version of
<b  >new</b>--adding the current line to
<b  >@questions</b>, incrementing
<b  >$counter</b>, and moving on to the next line of the
file.
</p><p>If the list does <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> contain six fields,
the line obviously contains an error. By the time we perform this
test, we have already eliminated the possibility that the current
line could be a comment or solely contain whitespace.</p><p>But wait a second&mdash;the caller is expecting to receive an
object of type <b  >QuizQuestions</b> in return. Because
the <b  >QuizQuestions</b> object can return many
different kinds of scalar data, we have to make sure that the
caller can determine whether the method invocation was a success
(i.e., an object was returned) or a failure (i.e., a string was
returned).</p><p>In this case, we use Perl's <b  >ref</b> operator
to find out if a scalar is a reference to an object and what kind
of object it is. Invoking <b  >ref</b> on a non-object
scalar returns an empty string, which makes such testing easy. So,
in the above version of <b  >new</b>, we can create an
instance of <b  >QuizQuestions</b> with this code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $questions = new QuizQuestions("emacs");
&amp;log_and_die($questions) unless (ref($questions)
         eq "
</pre><p>The second line checks to see if
<b  >$questions</b> is an instance of
<b  >QuizQuestions</b>. If not, we call
<b  >&amp;log_and_die</b>, a routine (included in in
Listing 5) that provides nicer logging of errors than a simple call
to <b  >die</b>.
</p><p>While this code works, it makes for a poorly designed object.
After all, why write the constructor so that the caller has to test
the type of the object it returned? A better solution is to make
<b  >new</b> a minimalist creation method, and put the
quizfile-loading mechanism into another method, called
<b  >loadFile</b>. This new method could then return
either 0 indicating no error or a string containing the offending
line.</p><p>With such methods in place, we write:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $questions = new QuizQuestions("emacs");
my $error = $questions-&gt;loadFile;
&amp;log_and_die($error) if $error;
</pre><p>This code creates an instance of
<b  >QuizQuestions</b> using the <b  >new</b>
operator, which does only the bare essentials. We load quiz file
with the <b  >loadFile</b> method. The
<b  >loadFile</b> method returns either 0, indicating
that the file was loaded successfully, or a text string containing
the line that caused a problem.
</p><p>Since we modified <b  >loadFile</b> to deal with
errors, I have replaced the original uses of <b  >die</b>
which are inappropriate in a low-level object, (as mentioned
earlier), with calls to <b  >return</b>.</p><p>Rewritten versions of <b  >new</b> and
<b  >loadFile</b> are shown in
<a href="2224l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a58580.0x1b48d30"></a>Creating the Quiz File</h2></div></div><p>So far, we have dealt with ways in which the
<b  >QuizQuestions</b> object can handle syntax errors
within the quiz file. But many syntax errors are created simply by
mistake or by users unfamiliar with the defined file format.</p><p>One solution is to provide users with tools for creating quiz
files with fewer errors. Given the amount of time we spend writing
CGI programs and HTML forms, it makes sense to create a short
program that takes the contents of an HTML form and saves it to
disk.</p><p>An example of one such form is shown in
<a href="2224l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a>. Upon submission, the
form's contents are handed to create-quizfile.pl, which then
creates a properly formatted quiz file.</p><p>In order to implement this feature, we need to add two new
methods to <b  >QuizQuestions</b>. One,
<b  >addQuestion</b>, takes a six-element list and adds
it to <b  >questions</b>, the instance variable
containing fields from the quiz file. The second method,
<b  >saveFile</b>, does the opposite of
<b  >loadFile</b>, taking the current questions and
saving them.</p><p>Here is one possible implementation of
<b  >addQuestion</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sub addQuestion
{
    # Get ourselves
    my $self = shift;
    # Get our arguments
    my ($question, $a1, $a2, $a3, $a4,
                    $correct) = @_;
    # Turn our arguments into a string
    my $new_question = join("      ", @_);
    # Get our instance variable
    my @questions = @{$self-&gt;{"questions"}};
    # Add the new question
    push (@questions, $new_question);
    # Reset the instance variable
    $self-&gt;{"questions"} = \@questions;
    # Return successfully (= 0)
    return 0;
}
</pre><p>This version of <b  >addQuestion</b> is fairly
simple, if not very robust. For instance, it doesn't check to make
sure the correct answer is one of A, B, C or D. But it does let us
add new questions to the <b  >QuizQuestions</b> object.
Notice that <b  >addQuestion</b> both retrieves and sets
values for the instance variable <b  >questions</b>.
</p><p>If we were interested in extending our quiz on Emacs, we
could use <b  >addQuestion</b> in the following
way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $error = $questions-&gt;loadFile;
&amp;log_and_die($error) if $error;
$questions-&gt;addQuestion(
"What term describes the cursor's current location?",
  "mark", "point", "cursor", "mouse", "B");
</pre><p>Immediately after executing this code,
<b  >$questions</b> contains one more question. However,
this question is lost upon the program's exit, because we have not
yet saved the new question to the quiz file. In order to save the
questions to a quiz file, define <b  >saveFile</b> like
this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
sub saveFile
{
    # Get ourselves
    my $self = shift;
    # Open the questions file for writing
    open (QUESTIONS, "&gt;$questionDir" .
                    $self-&gt;{"quizname"}) ||
        return "Could not open " .
                    $self-&gt;{"quizname"} . " for writing";
    # Loop through the questions
    my @questions = @{$self-&gt;{"questions"}};
    my $question;
    for each $question (@questions)
    {
        print QUESTIONS $question, "\n";
    }
    close(QUESTIONS);
    return 0;
}
</pre>


This code iterates through the questions, and writes them to the
quiz file. Since we are writing all of the questions to disk rather
than appending them, we use the <b  >&gt;</b> when
opening the file, thereby overwriting any data that existed
previously.
</p><p>Since <b  >saveFile</b> saves only the contents of
the <b  >questions</b> instance variable, it effectively
obliterates comments and white space in the file. Of course, anyone
creating the quiz file using a program is unlikely to look at the
comments. Nonetheless, a more refined version of
<b  >saveFile</b> and the
<b  >QuizQuestions</b> object might let users add
comments and white space to the file, as well as questions.
(Obviously, the HTML form would also have to allow for
this.)</p><p>Our version of <b  >saveFile</b> uses the same
system for reporting errors as <b  >loadFile</b>--by
returning a string, while the lack of an error is indicated by
returning 0. This lets us use the following code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$error = $questions-&gt;saveFile;
&amp;log_and_die($error) if $error;
</pre><p>Now that you have seen the skeleton for create-quizfile.pl,
you should have a good understanding of the program shown in
<a href="2224l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a>. This version of
create-quizfile.pl is fairly straightforward. It checks to see if
the user entered a question; if there is text for a question, it
takes the remaining parameters from the HTML form submitted.
</p><p>Now is a good time to remember that CGI programs that write
user-defined strings to your file system are potentially dangerous,
and thus must be placed in locations that are restricted to
authorized users, either by using your HTTP server's built-in
protection or by placing such programs behind a firewall. No matter
how unlikely this may seem, a user may eventually discover that you
have a program named create-quizfile.pl, and create quizzes on your
system, possibly overwriting your creations.</p><p>This month, we made our quiz engine friendlier for
non-programmers by checking the integrity of the quiz file and by
allowing users to create quiz files using HTML forms. What happens
when users want to edit quiz files? For now, they are stuck
modifying the file on disk, which again opens Pandora's box of
potential syntax problems. While we can discover these problems
with our simple error-checking code, it might be a good idea to
create a program that can edit quiz files as well as create them.
Next month, we will modify create-quizfile.pl to do just that,
making our quiz system easier for everyone to handle.</p></div></div>
