the guise of Editor of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span>, for the
Italian Edition of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span>. I know it
sounds strange, but the Italian edition is basically our
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LG</em></span> with a few additions such as this
interview. (I really wasn't interviewing myself.) Since I wanted to
talk about <span   class="emphasis"><em>LG</em></span> this month anyway, I thought
presenting the interview would be a good way to do it. The
questions were presented to me by Francesco De Carlo, a member of
the faculty of Computer Science at University of BARI, Italy and
the Director of the Italian Edition of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Gazette</em></span>, which can be found at
www.media.it/LUGBari/index.html. Mr. De Carlo can be reached via
e-mail at fdecarlo@mailbox.media.it.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mr. De Carlo:</b></span> When and why
did SSC decide to publish <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span> in the
current version? Originally, <span   class="emphasis"><em>LG</em></span> was edited
only as an extra-curricular activity by John M. Fisk.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie:</b></span>During the summer of
1996, John Fisk decided he no longer had the time to keep
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span> up in the fashion it deserved.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LG</em></span> had become very popular, and readers were
wanting it to come out on regular monthly basis. Between school and
work, John just didn't have time to do this, so he put out feelers
looking for someone to take it over. We responded and he accepted
us as the right people to continue <span   class="emphasis"><em>LG</em></span>.</p><p>SSC responded to John because we had always felt that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span> was a worthy and necessary asset
to the Linux community. We did not want to see it either go away or
be taken over by someone who would turn it into a commercial
enterprise. We promised John that <span   class="emphasis"><em>LG</em></span> would
remain free and it has.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mr. De Carlo:</b></span> What kind of
relationship does the <span   class="emphasis"><em>LG</em></span> have with his &ldquo;big
brother&rdquo; <i  >Linux Journal</i>? Some exchanges of
articles, writers, ...?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie:</b></span>Yes, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Gazette</em></span> and <i  >Linux Journal</i> do a lot
of sharing. As of February 1 of this year, I am Editor of both
<i  >Linux Journal</i> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Gazette</em></span>. Every month we use an article from
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LG</em></span> in <i  >Linux Journal</i>, and
occasionally, I will use articles from <i  >LJ</i> in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LG</em></span>--usually those about conferences and other
events surrounding Linux. And yes, I have authors who write for
both magazines, most notably the regular contributors of columns to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LG</em></span>: Larry Ayers, John Fisk and Michael Hammel.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span>'s Answer Guy, Jim Dennis, has
done an interview with Stronghold's Sameer Parekh, which will be
appearing in the July issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mr. De Carlo:</b></span>: Are authors
wishing to write for <span   class="emphasis"><em>LG</em></span> contacted by you or do
they send articles to you? That is: do you prepare a list of the
subjects that will be discussed in the next issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LG</em></span>, or can users send you any article, on any
topic?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie:</b></span>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LG</em></span> is managed very casually; authors can send
me articles on any topic and I will include them. Whatever comes in
during the month goes in the next issue. There is no focus other
than Linux. Also, I do not edit the articles; they are posted just
as the authors send them.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mr. De Carlo:</b></span> Are you alone
in producing <span   class="emphasis"><em>LG</em></span>? Or do you have a real
&ldquo;editorial office&rdquo; with real &ldquo;editors&rdquo; and &ldquo;reporters&rdquo;? If
yes, how do you make it function?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie:</b></span> I have no real
editors or reporters to help. I depend on outside authors in the
Linux community to make their contributions, and the wonderful
thing is, they do. Some months I have more material than others
(January was really packed), but I've never been short. I have
gotten a lot of help with graphics and HTML from SSC's webmaster,
Michael Montoure. Beginning this month, I have a new assistant, Amy
Kukuk, who will be helping out by doing the <span   class="emphasis"><em>News
Byte</em></span> column and perhaps more.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mr. De Carlo:</b></span> What are your
plans for the near future? Introducing a new
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LG</em></span> with a renewed graphic look, new articles
and so on?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie:</b></span> I intend to continue
posting <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span> each month and promoting
it wherever I can. I feel it is even more of an asset than ever to
both new and experienced Linux users.</p><p>Our look seems to change periodically. With the March issue,
we dropped the spiral that caused so many problems. Michael is
inventive, and we mainly add things as we come up with them.</p><p>We have two new columns that will be appearing regularly,
&ldquo;The Answer Guy&rdquo; by Jim Dennis, and &ldquo;Clueless at the Prompt, A
Column for New Users&rdquo;, by Mike List. Both columns are good for new
users looking for help.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span> is free for the readers,
but is not free for SSC. To help defray the publishing cost,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LG</em></span> has begun accepting sponsors. A small
acknowledgment of these sponsors will be made on the Front Page.
Our first sponsor is InfoMagic&mdash;our thanks to them for their
help.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mr. De Carlo:</b></span> What do you
think about our LGEI? Is it a good idea and, above all, can it help
Italian Linux users to better understand this OS?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie:</b></span> I think LGEI is
wonderful! It'a great way to spread the word about Linux to all
Italy. With our regular columns and articles, as well as all the
tips and tricks people send us, I feel LGEI is an invaluable
resource to Italian Linux users, just as our English version is to
Linux users worldwide.</p></div></div>
