Your Inner Potato</h2></div></div><p>The March Issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span>, the computer
industry's utopian fashion monthly, declares its wish to supplant
the Web with media more suited to advertising. In a &ldquo;special
bulletin&rdquo; by Kevin Kelly and Gary Wolf, and with its customary
overstatement and retinal-torture colors, the magazine devotes its
cover and the eleven pages that follow to &ldquo;PUSH! Kiss your browser
goodbye: The radical future of media beyond the Web&rdquo;--a manifesto
on the &ldquo;emerging universe of networked media that are spreading
across the telecosm.&rdquo;</p><p>This universe doesn't exist yet, so
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span> evokes its promise with the language of
a sci-fi movie trailer: &ldquo;Think video. Think text flickering over
your walls. Think games that work. Think anything where a staid,
link-based browser is useless.&rdquo; Imagine &ldquo;a zillion non-page items
of information and entertainment.&rdquo;</p><p>The Web, sadly, is just &ldquo;an archive medium&rdquo;. It's &ldquo;a
wonderful library,&rdquo; <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span> says, &ldquo;but a
library nonetheless.&rdquo; Hey, who wants to surf in a public building?
What today's Netizens really want is &ldquo;a land of push-pull, active
objects, virtual space and ambient broadcasting.&rdquo;</p><p>This land won't rise from the work of the ordinary schlubs
who now fill the Web's library with goods that offer rather than
push. No, this Shangri-La will be summoned from the void by
&ldquo;20-year-old hot shots in the labs of PointCast, ESPNET,
SportsZone and CNET.&rdquo; Thanks to their pioneering genius, the
browser is already &ldquo;dying as the main event, to be reborn as a
subsumed function and occasional option.&rdquo;</p><p>Even though &ldquo;the design of what is emerging...is now neither
clear nor important,&rdquo; <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span> is sure it will
let you &ldquo;move seamlessly between media you steer (interactive) and
media that steer you (passive).&rdquo;</p><p>Let us pause to observe that the notion of media that steer
you was never part of the Net's&mdash;or any other media's&mdash;appeal. The
Internet's success owes exactly nothing to those who would use it
for manipulation.</p><p>But I'll hand it to the editors of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span>: when they sell out, they go all the
way. Not long ago, the magazine wrote an April Fool piece on &ldquo;The
death of the Web&rdquo;. Now they mean it. &ldquo;It turns out only a handful
of us are up for the vigorous activity of reaching out to engage
the world,&rdquo; they say. &ldquo;Most of us are still addicted to passive
media.&rdquo; Which, it turns out, is a good thing, because &ldquo;there's a
little couch potato in all of us.&rdquo;</p><p>Pity the poor spuds forced to face &ldquo;information framed on a
two-dimensional hypertext page,&rdquo; and to &ldquo;navigate blind clickable
links and search engine requests, drilling down to try to find what
they want.&rdquo; No wonder such labor-intensive tools are &ldquo;retreating
into the bowels of the Net.&rdquo;</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span> wants your inner potato to enjoy
&ldquo;a more full-bodied experience that combines many of the traits of
networks with those of broadcast.&rdquo; This combination is what our
young farmers call <span   class="emphasis"><em>push media</em></span>: &ldquo;content is
pushed to you, in contrast to the invitational pull you make when
you click on the Web.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The central mission&rdquo; of this new agriculture &ldquo;is to shoot
every conceivable media flavor across, through, in between and
around a network that includes every possible hardware device.&rdquo;
What you get will be &ldquo;in-your-face, immersive, experiential push
media.&rdquo;</p><p>The editors say &ldquo;at first glance all this looks a lot like
the revenge of TV.&rdquo; At last, from beneath the Web's riot of
voluntary vegetation &ldquo;the subterranean instincts of couch potatoes
rise again!&rdquo;</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span> tells us &ldquo;push&rdquo; has been with us
since the Dawn of Art. In journalism, for example, &ldquo;once you dive
into a story...the author pushes you along, and the magazine
steers.&rdquo; At movies you &ldquo;surrender to the director's manipulation
of your emotion and your mind.&rdquo; Indeed, art is a pushy
business.</p><p>And thankless too. Consider the pitiless consumers whose
constant rejection the pushers endure. &ldquo;In the competitive jungle
of 500,000 channels&rdquo;, today's pushiest media are subject to &ldquo;the
relentless interactive tick of the zapper.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That almost neurotic urge to zap,&rdquo;
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span> says, &ldquo;has falsely led people to think
that what viewers want is more zapping, more control, more
steering. What they want instead are more ways to zap.&rdquo; Enter
&ldquo;the emerging postbrowser interfaces&rdquo; that &ldquo;create different
ways to <span   class="emphasis"><em>play</em></span> human attention.&rdquo;</p><p>Sadly, the Web is too demanding for the average spud. &ldquo;Web
users suffer a sense of being lost and overwhelmed.&rdquo; More than
half of them have given up surfing, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span>
laments, because they just hit the same old sites, or they find
&ldquo;the signal is camouflaged by all the noise.&rdquo;</p><p>That noise is made by spuds whose web content is second-rate,
or worse, kind of a hobby. They've turned the Web into a craft fair
of bad watercolors and lopsided ceramic bowls, where such
in-your-face ties as those created by the artisans at
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span> are all too rare.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, rolling your own is very rewarding, but often we'd
like someone else to slip us a ready-made. Even though it may not
be as nifty as the one we made. Or maybe because it is niftier and
better made.&rdquo;</p><p>Trust your inner potato. &ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Seinfeld</em></span>
viewers know what we're talking about.&rdquo; Television succeeds for a
good reason. &ldquo;You dial it for a mainline fix of unadulterated
push. It's great for that universal plunge into the Thing Larger
Than Myself.&rdquo; (<span   class="emphasis"><em>Seinfeld</em></span>? Are we that
small?)</p><p>And so &ldquo;we are now about to arrive at television (push
media), before we finally emerge into what interactivity is really
about.&rdquo;</p><p>Ah, so all this push business is really just television, only
better&mdash;more &ldquo;ambient&rdquo;, more &ldquo;ubiquitous&rdquo;, more &ldquo;sexy&rdquo;, more
of a &ldquo;warm, familiar, fuzzy convenience&rdquo;. Well, that brings us to
the big question: Who is going to pay for all this?</p><p>Advertisers, of course. &ldquo;Advertisers and content sellers are
very willing to underwrite this,&rdquo; <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span> says,
even though they would be wrong to &ldquo;happily back push media in
hopes that the spells that work on TV will work there too.&rdquo; But
hey, advertisers are easily hypnotized, too. &ldquo;Push has advertisers
transfixed,&rdquo; the editors say. &ldquo;In the short run, advertisers can
be counted on to pile in.&rdquo;</p><p>This from a company that hasn't been able to sell an IPO
because even the ravenously credulous investors who are driving
stock prices to the sky don't buy their magazine's inflated
estimates of itself.</p><p>Well, let me tell you about advertising.</p><p>Before some of today's push geniuses were born, I co-founded
what is now one of Silicon Valley's biggest advertising agencies.
My name is still on the door. That agency does many millions of
dollars in annual billings, mostly in print. Some of it, I suppose,
runs in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span>.</p><p>Advertising is a product of scarce access to large numbers of
customers and prospects. Since the Dawn of Advertising, The Media
have been the sole providers of that access, and they've charged a
lot for it.</p><p>But when companies find ways to interact directly with
customers and prospects, they will shoot resellers, distributors,
retailers, advertising media and every other margin-demanding
intermediary that stands in the way. In fact, the shooting has
already started. The result is a new trend called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>disintermediation</em></span>. It's a lot more scary than
downsizing, because it starves whole companies and business
categories, rather than just a few employees.</p><p>The most threatened businesses are the ones that depend on
advertising. This is why the last thing ad-supported media want is
an efficient market for product information. But that's exactly
what the Net provides.</p><p>The lights <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span> sees at the end of the
Web's dark tunnel are miner's lamps of countless companies digging
toward their customers. They're digging with the same Internet
tools <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span> now demeans, including the Web,
browsers and e-mail. These tools cost squat, and they do an amazing
job.</p><p>In the face of this, advertising has an existential choice:
help dig or get shoveled aside.</p><p>The shoveling will be easy. The advertising we all know and
hate is a huge and often wasteful expense that most CEOs can
downsize or ax with few immediate penalties. Some executives and
suppliers might lose their jobs, but the SEC and IRS won't even
notice.</p><p>And don't think the Big Boys aren't looking carefully at the
issue, even if they share <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span>'s da-glo wet
dreams about &ldquo;immersive media&rdquo; and &ldquo;ambient
advertising&rdquo;.</p><p>Two years ago at PC Forum, John Warnock of Adobe observed
that ads in <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></span> waste lots
of trees and deliver no obvious results, while a single notice on
the company's web site brings thousands of downloads and countless
useful customer relationships. And Warnock is one of the guys who
appreciates image building, branding, positioning and other
advertising arts.</p><p>The Net shortens the distance between supply and demand, both
for products and for information. What <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span>
calls &ldquo;a vast unmapped cave of documents&rdquo; is the most powerful
marketing resource ever created, because it can deliver deep and
rich marketing content on demand&mdash;especially once it's
mapped.</p><p>Does <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span> really think &ldquo;spelunking&rdquo;
with search engines is the terminal stage of network organization,
and that what traditional LANs call &ldquo;directory services&rdquo; won't
show up soon? (For clues about where all this going, check out
Netscape's <span   class="emphasis"><em>LDAP White Paper</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>a
Bulldozer Through the Intersection</em></span> in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Reality
2.0</em></span>:
http://www.batnet.com/searls/bulldozer.html.)</p><p>There is something huge happening on the pull side of more
markets than Thomas Register can list. It's not creating dumb web
pages and not surfing around for entertaining distractions. It's
demanding useful information, contacting suppliers directly, and
treating as garbage everything that doesn't add value. That garbage
will include much of today's advertising and the media that depend
on it&mdash;unless, of course, they evolve to life forms that survive
what in TechnoLatin we might call &ldquo;the emerging demand-driven
information environment&rdquo;.</p><p>By demeaning both the supply and the demand sides of markets
for everything other than narcotic entertainment,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span> sets new altitude records for stupidity
and arrogance. If the magazine had any moral content in the first
place&mdash;and I have to believe they did, given a masthead that still
includes Stewart Brand, John Perry Barlow, Esther Dyson, John
Heileman and other advocates of freedom and self-worth&mdash;they
forfeited it with this contemptible tract.</p><p>What <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span> editors hail is really a
postmodern <span   class="emphasis"><em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em></span>. It
treats Netizens not only as vegetables, but as hosts for its
advertisers' pods.</p><p>Fortunately, advertisers live in reality. I hope they give
these fools a dose of it.</p></div></div>
