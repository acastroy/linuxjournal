    How to survive the SYN attack on a TCP/IP protocol weakness.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1284580.0x137c920"></a></h2></div></div><p>Over the past few months, a denial of
service attack, known as the &ldquo;SYN Attack&rdquo;, has become notorious.
This attack can prevent access to your mail, WWW and other critical
servers. The attack was first described in a paper by Robert Morris
in 1985 and received little attention. It wasn't until
<span   class="emphasis"><em>2600</em></span> magazine published source code to exploit
this weakness in popular implementations of the TCP/IP protocol
stack that this weakness grabbed the attention of Internet Service
Providers. One provider, Public Access Networks Corporation of New
York City, was attacked repeatedly last September, causing its mail
and web servers to be unavailable to its users for extended periods
of time. In this article we explain what SYN really is, why it's
needed in TCP/IP, why the attack works and how to prevent it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1284580.0x137ca80"></a>Introduction</h2></div></div><p>The Internet works as well as it does because its data
communication protocols (IP, TCP and UDP) evolved over a decade
through major revisions and trial-and-error &ldquo;adjustments&rdquo;. As a
result, the protocols have developed a legendary robustness that
makes them difficult to defeat; however, these protocols were
designed with the basic assumption that all network administrators
can be trusted. Unfortunately, this is not true in today's Internet
environment. Given the right kind of knowledge, virtually any PC
can be configured so that a malicious individual, acting as a
system or network administrator, can bring down any number of
servers on the Internet.</p><p>One of these vulnerabilities is called the &ldquo;SYN&rdquo;
(synchronous) attack, and it can affect anyone who places a server
on the Internet. The SYN attack is a denial of service attack,
blocking others from connecting to your server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1284580.0x137cbe0"></a>Network Layers</h2></div></div><p>The Internet protocol stack utilizes three primary layers of
the OSI model. The lowest layer is the physical layer, and it
contains the physical wires, network host adapter(s) and adapter
device driver(s). The next layer is the data link layer, whose job
is to read a stream of bits off the network and assemble them into
frames for the next higher layer.</p><p>The Internet Protocol (IP) or network layer is the next
layer. It examines the incoming frames to determine if they are IP
packets and, if not, it passes the frame onto another protocol
stack (e.g., Novell) or discards the frame as nonsense. If it is an
IP packet, the packet contents are further evaluated by the IP
layer for a number of IP related activities such as Address
Resolution Protocol (ARP) or Internet Control and Message Protocol
(ICMP), which the connectionless <b  >ping</b> and
<b  >traceroute</b> applications employ.</p><p>If the packet is not one of the above formats, its content
continues to be evaluated as a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packet. If the packet contains a
TCP header, it is posted to the next higher TCP layer. The verb
&ldquo;posted&rdquo; is significant in that the packet is moved to another
place for processing, and that processing will occur sometime in
the future. In other words, it is at the IP-TCP boundary where
information, driven by interrupts, &ldquo;bubbles up&rdquo; from the
environment; it is at the IP-TCP boundary where information waits
for processing based upon requests from programs that wish to
communicate with the network. Therefore, the IP-TCP boundary
contains a fixed amount of memory buffers allocated to network
&ldquo;activity&rdquo; without the system really knowing what that activity
is. It is at this boundary that the SYN attack works.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1284580.0x137ce48"></a>SYN Protocol by Analogy</h2></div></div><p>Before discussing the third Internet layer and how TCP
establishes a connection, perhaps it is better to begin with an
analogy that illustrates a typical network problem and how TCP
overcomes the problem in its daily routine.</p><p>Our analogy begins on a college campus with a studious
student (SS) who has the misfortune of being placed in a &ldquo;party&rdquo;
dorm. On a typical evening, SS is studying at his desk trying to
master some dry material on data link protocols for his computer
networks class. Someone knocks at his door. Upon opening the door,
he gets hit with a water balloon from his rowdy neighbors. Using
the material from his network class, SS comes up with a solution to
stop his pesky neighbors, yet still greet his invited
visitors.</p><p>He decides on a &ldquo;secret knock&rdquo;&mdash;his friends announce
themselves with a one to five knock code. SS hears the knock and
goes to the door; however, he does not open it. Instead, he repeats
the original knock and adds his own one to five knock code. Now the
visitor knocks the next &ldquo;sequence&rdquo; of his code and repeats SS's
knocks.</p><p>These knocking gymnastics are referred to as a three-way
handshake (see Figure 1) in data communications lingo, and solve
three common network problems. First, they allow two hosts to
establish starting &ldquo;sequence&rdquo; numbers which are used by the
receiver to re-order packets or reassemble datagrams. Second, they
enable the host to identify duplicate packets that occur from
re-transmissions which, in turn, are a result of delayed responses.
Finally, if either computer were to initiate a connection with a
third computer at the same time, then two orderly connections could
result, without confusion.</p><p><a href="2056f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. The
3-Way Handshake</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1284580.0x137d160"></a>The Transport Station</h2></div></div><p>Network traffic arrives at a given host and accumulates at
the IP-TCP boundary, but nothing happens until a user-level process
performs a request for network service through the transport
station (TCP or UDP).</p><p>Most user-level Internet applications use a &ldquo;virtual
circuit&rdquo; model for communication with web browsers such as
Netscape or Lynx, FTP clients and Telnet clients. Steps in creating
a connection or virtual circuit require the remote computer to
request a &ldquo;connect&rdquo; which puts an IP packet in the local
computer's IP-TCP boundary buffers. The local computer program
requests a &ldquo;listen&rdquo;, then an &ldquo;accept&rdquo;. It is during these
listen-connect-accept phases that TCP employs the three-way
handshake to establish a virtual circuit.</p><p>Let's say there are two hosts, A and B, which exist on a
network. A wishes to connect to B and issues a connect request.
There are six bits defined in the TCP datagram header, two of which
are the &ldquo;SYN&rdquo; (synchronize) and &ldquo;ACK&rdquo; (acknowledge) bits. The
connect request datagram has the SYN bit set and the ACK bit
cleared. When the process on host B receives the datagram, it
accepts the sequence number, builds a reply datagram with B's
separate sequence number plus host A's sequence number incremented
by one, and the datagram is sent to A with the SYN and ACK bits on.
Host A now has confirmation that B has provisionally accepted the
connection, and it sends out the first data using the incremented
sequence from its first datagram and returning B's incremented
sequence number as an acknowledgment. The datagram now has just the
ACK bit set and when it is received by host B, the connection is
established. (See Figure 2.)</p><p><a href="2056f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
Establishing a Connection Using 3-Way
Handshake</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1284580.0x137d420"></a>The SYN Attack</h2></div></div><p>Returning to the above analogy for a moment, we can see that
the knock code is able to defeat SS's rambunctious neighbors, but
what if they decide to knock once an hour or once every five
minutes? What is our studious student to do? The knocks distract
him from his homework, but if he ignores the knocks he misses any
friends who come by. In other words, frequent knocks deny service
to SS's friends.</p><p>The same is true at the IP-TCP boundary buffers. Once the
host receives a SYN datagram and replies with an ACK datagram, how
long does the host wait for the third part of the handshake?
Unfortunately, current implementations wait forever.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, connections are established
quickly, and so developers assumed that only a few buffers would be
needed for all possible connections in the host. Under the 1.2.x
Linux kernels, only 10 buffers are allocated.</p><p>To create a SYN attack, a program does not simply use the
connect request; instead it opens a raw network connection directly
and sends a burst of TCP SYN datagrams, ignoring any replies from
the target host. The few buffers are now full and the target host
is unable to establish any subsequent connections. Service has been
denied to the target host. (See Figure 3.)</p><p><a href="2056f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3. The
SYN Attack</b></span></a></p><p>What makes this attack so insidious is that the attacker also
inserts random IP source addresses in each datagram, thereby making
it almost impossible for the remote host to trace the datagrams
back to the real source.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1284580.0x137d790"></a>A Case Study</h2></div></div><p>An Internet Service Provider (ISP) closed a user's account
because the user violated their acceptable use policy. This user
now gets an account at a competing ISP and, armed with the latest
issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>2600</em></span>, dials up the new ISP using his
PC running Linux. The user compiles the sample program given in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>2600</em></span>, and runs it repeatedly against his old
ISP's mail server and web server, filling up the connection queue
on the ISP's servers. No one can receive mail or reach the ISP's
web pages.</p><p>After restarting his web server several times, an
administrator at the ISP runs <b  >netstat</b> and
notices a lot of the entries are flagged SYN_RECV. All of these
entries are from random IP addresses. The administrator tries to
ping several of the addresses, but they all fail to return any
pings. The administrator then calls his network provider, a
prominent National Service Provider (NSP), and requests help in
tracking the attacks to the source. Unfortunately, the NSP is very
busy maintaining its network, and doesn't have the resources to
assist in such a search.</p><p>The ISP goes out of business.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1284580.0x137da50"></a>Solutions</h2></div></div><p>To lessen the severity of this attack, all providers should
install the proper filters to prevent packages from leaving their
network with forged source addresses, known as IP spoofing. This
can be done by preventing packets that have a source address from
outside your network from leaving your network.</p><p>Because the Linux kernel source code is under the GNU Public
License (GPL), anyone with a copy of Linux is entitled to the
source code. Having the source code, a user can apply a fix to his
kernel and recompile it. If you were using a proprietary operating
system, you would be at the mercy of your operating system
vendor.</p><p>One of the easiest ways around this problem is to increase
the size of the queue. This has been done in the 2.0.x kernels. If
the queue is made large enough, it becomes more difficult for hosts
with slow connections to the Internet (dial up, dynamic IP
connections) to flood enough packets to prevent normal
connections.</p><p>For your network servers to take advantage of the larger
queue, they must be recompiled with a larger value as the backlog
argument for the listen() function. <b  >Sendmail</b> and
<b  >inetd</b> (found in NetKit-B) are two important
programs that must be recompiled to &ldquo;SYN-proof&rdquo; your
system.</p><p>A patch from Alan Cox implements random dropping of
uncompleted connections, which prevents the buffers from filling,
although the number of partially completed connections in the
listen queue can increase. This same patch, which has yet to be
integrated into the 2.0.x kernels as of patch level 27, also
disallows a single class C from using up more than 30% of the
queue. This last method prevents attacks from providers who have
installed the source filters discussed above and from exploiters
who do not use random source addresses.</p><p>The patch for the current kernel (2.0.29) can be obtained
from http://www.dna.lth.se/~erics/linux.html. To apply it, download
and unzip the patch into the /usr/src subdirectory and type</p><p><b  >patch &lt; tcp-syncookies-patch-1</b>. When
you run <b  >make config</b> (or
<b  >menuconfig</b> or <b  >xconfig</b>), you
will see two additions under &ldquo;Networking Options&rdquo;. Just compile
them into the kernel.</p><p>Other methods of protection have been suggested on various
Internet forums, including creative firewalls that establish the
TCP connection and then pass it on. Several companies are marketing
commercial products based on these ideas. These solutions are not
necessary for Linux users. Network solutions such as those are for
users who don't have the option of compiling a fixed kernel.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1284580.0x1776220"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The Internet is undergoing a massive scaling, and as a
result, it is no longer possible to identify a given network
administrator. While the Internet protocols were designed for
unreliable networks, they were not designed for untrusted
networks.</p><p>Although the SYN attack has proven very effective in denying
service to important servers, the problem is well under control in
the Linux world. The combination of a larger queue and the random
drop technique makes your Linux-based system relatively immune to
this attack.</p></div></div>
