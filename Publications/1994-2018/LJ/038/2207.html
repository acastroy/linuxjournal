The one we usually associate
with Linux is the kernel developed by Linus Torvalds. And the
other, the one we often take for granted, is the set of GNU tools
that make up the portable software development system from the Free
Software Foundation (FSF). <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming with GNU
Software</em></span> is a brief but thoroughly useful introduction
to these tools and how to use them. The tools covered are Emacs,
the C and C++ compilers gcc and g++, the gdb debugger, the
<b  >make</b> utility, the RCS revision control system
and gprof, a utility for profiling and timing your programs. The
CD-ROM contains the sources for these tools and compiled binaries
for several popular Unix systems such as SunOS and Solaris for
SPARC, HP-UX for HP9000, AIX for the RS/6000, Irix for Indigo, and
DEC Unix for the Alpha.</p><p>The book and CD-ROM combination is not specifically intended
for Linux users, but this is an important book for anyone who
develops software for Unix or Linux. This book was described as
&ldquo;forthcoming&rdquo; in an O'Reilly catalog over a year ago and I have
been eagerly awaiting it since then. If you have a recent
distribution of Linux, you probably already have most or all of the
tools discussed here. Even so, nearly everything in the book, and
many of the sources on the CD-ROM, can be useful to Linux beginners
and experts alike. A significant additional benefit is the
discussion of cross-compilation and cross-development for a wide
variety of platforms. If you are interested in portable software or
porting applications, embedded systems, or just a good introduction
to the GNU tools, this book is a good place to start.</p><p>The libraries on the CD-ROM are not the FSF versions governed
by the LGPL (a General Public License for libraries). The libraries
are rewritten versions from Cygnus Support, a company that ports
and supports free software for commercial use, particularly in
embedded systems. Using the Cygnus libraries avoids the more
impractical restrictions of the LGPL for commercial embedded
systems, and Cygnus requires only that you acknowledge use of their
software. If you invent the world's greatest latte maker/bagel
warmer, for example, and use the FSF libraries in the controller,
you either have to make the source code available or provide a way
for your customers to upgrade the libraries in case of a new
release. If you have any questions about the legal issues, you
should contact Cygnus Support. Check out their web site at
http://www.cygnus.com/.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f57580.0x204fbe0"></a>Using GNU Tools</h2></div></div><p>After an introduction and discussion of free software
philosophy in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 offers a brief introduction to
the use of Unix and its traditional tools for software development.
Then Chapter 3 gets into the heart of GNU software with Emacs. If
you have been intimidated by the sheer mass of Emacs, you should
find this chapter an easy way to get started.</p><p>The coverage in this book is not simply introductory, but
also has depth where it counts. Even though I've used versions of
Emacs for years I learned several new tricks in this chapter. For
example, I like to use the original Kernighan &amp; Ritchie
indentation style in my C programs, and indent by four spaces with
each press of the TAB key. Using an example in the book, I was able
to add a customization to my default initialization file, .emacsrc,
in my home directory. Now, whenever I edit a file that ends in .c,
.cpp or .h, Emacs will automatically be in C-mode, and will indent
my programs properly when I press the TAB key at the beginning of a
line. Most of its features and all of its customizations are
written in Emacs Lisp. Emacs itself is mostly an interpreter for
this language and its many extensions. Also covered is how to run
the compiler from within Emacs, so you can continue editing while
compilation proceeds in the background.</p><p>The GNU software tools are integrated and work together in a
variety of ways, and Emacs is at the heart of it. Here are some
additional incentives for learning and using Emacs I've gleaned
from the book:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>bash&mdash;the default Linux shell&mdash;uses Emacs commands
for basic command line and history editing.</p></li><li><p>info&mdash;the command often more helpful than man
pages&mdash;is an Emacs-like hypertext application that uses a special
set of commands for basic navigation plus many familiar Emacs
commands.</p></li><li><p>gdb&mdash;a shell in its own right&mdash;uses Emacs commands
for basic command line and history editing.</p></li></ol></div><p>Because of the interoperability between Emacs, bash, gcc, GNU
make, RCS and gdb, learning to use Emacs just makes good
sense.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f57580.0x2050058"></a>Compiling with gcc</h2></div></div><p>Chapter 4 begins with an overview of the compilation process,
including the preprocessor, translator/optimizer, assembler and
linker, plus many other tools (such as the libraries) that take
part in the software development process. There are many compiler
options, optimization levels and intermediate file formats you can
use. Like the rest of the book, this chapter does not attempt to be
a comprehensive reference. Instead, it does a good job of
discussing the most frequently used commands and options, and adds
tips that even power users will appreciate. The chapter ends with
an introduction to cross-compilers, and the requirements for
building your own libraries in a cross-development environment. A
table is included that outlines the large number of host and target
systems supported by the Cygnus libraries, and the output formats
such as a.out, COFF and ELF, that can be generated.</p><p>Chapter 5 continues with more details about using the C and
C++ libraries, and what is needed to support the system interface
to Unix- or Posix-like systems. So if you are interested in porting
Linux to the latest 64-bit PDA or the new WebTV your aunt just
bought on sale, this is the place to learn what it takes. Keep in
mind that these two chapters are not about the C or C++ languages
or how to write programs. Many other books are more useful as
learning aids (see the Resources sidebar). Chapter 5 ends with a
brief discussion of the library licensing issues.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f57580.0x20501b8"></a>Debugging with gdb</h2></div></div><p>The GNU debugging tool, gdb, is an interactive shell with its
own commands, history (previously executed commands) and editor
(Emacs-like, of course). The basic idea is that you can control and
examine the internal working of an executing process, and interact
with its source code and variables. The coverage of gdb is
extensive here, and I have not seen gdb covered with a good
tutorial in any other reference. This coverage alone could be worth
the price of the book.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f57580.0x20502c0"></a>Building Programs with make</h2></div></div><p>The <b  >make</b> utility is used to build programs
from multiple sources and compiles only files in need of updating,
based on the date stamps and dependencies for each file. It is
fairly easy to write simple dependencies so that if an include file
is changed, for example, only the files that use it are recompiled;
automating these steps saves time when building a new executable
program. The <b  >make</b> utility has been around a long
time and has become very sophisticated, and the GNU
<b  >make</b> is one of the most comprehensive. The
coverage in Chapter 7 is brief, but is an excellent tutorial
introduction that covers both basic and advanced features. For more
in-depth coverage, see the O'Reilly book on
<b  >make</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f57580.0x2050528"></a>Managing Source with RCS</h2></div></div><p>The RCS revision control system is a tool to manage the
versions of a program as it evolves over time. GNU
<b  >make</b> is aware of RCS, and can automatically use
the current revisions. Again, the coverage is brief but presents
sufficient basics for you to start using them; further details are
available in other works from O'Reilly and FSF.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f57580.0x2050688"></a>Profiling with gprof</h2></div></div><p>There are two tools for timing and profiling your programs:
<b  >time</b> and <b  >gprof</b>. The
<b  >time</b> command is built into the bash shell and is
similar to the <b  >timex</b> command in other shells. It
simply gives the elapsed execution time of a program as a whole,
broken down by user and system, with a few additional system
details. The <b  >gprof</b> tool is a report generator
that can provide detailed information on where your program is
spending its time. The <b  >gprof</b> utility can give
either a one-dimensional profile or a two-dimensional accounting
that follows the call graph of your program. The call
<b  >graph</b> starts with the <b  >main()</b>
function and has an execution breakdown for every function called
that includes both the time spent and the number of times the
function is called. It even handles recursive programs. Learning to
use <b  >gprof</b> is the best way to improve the
performance of your programs. Coverage of this important tool has
not been easily available elsewhere and is another reason why this
book is a valuable resource.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f57580.0x2050aa8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>What is particularly good about this book is the combination
of an excellent tutorial style that makes it easy for you to get
started, and depth that cuts to the important topics in each
subject. Even if you are already experienced with C/C++ programming
using Unix tools, you will find many useful tips. With only about
250 pages, this is brief coverage, and the one thing I might wish
for is a more complete reference. For that we will have to turn
elsewhere, such as the <b  >info</b> pages and the
references listed below. I'm sure this book will be a valuable
reference for me for some time. The authors, Mike Loukides and Andy
Orem, are senior technical editors with O'Reilly and have done an
excellent job that rises well above the average for software
documentation.</p><p><a href="2207s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
