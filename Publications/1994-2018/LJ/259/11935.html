In this article, Dave Taylor shows complicated script code to complete the
findwords script. Now you'll be ready to crush everyone in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Words with Friends</em></span>.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24e5580.0x25dd408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
It was a dark and stormy night when I started this series here in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>&mdash;at least two months ago, and in Internet terms, that's quite a
while. And just wait until our robot overlords are running the show,
because then two months will be 10&ndash;20 generations of robot evolution and
quite frankly, the T-2000 probably could have solved this problem
already anyway.
</p><p>
Puny humans!
</p><p>
But, we haven't yet reached the singularity&mdash;at least, I
don't think so. I asked Siri, and she said we hadn't, so that's
good enough, right? Let's dive back in to this programming project
because the end is nigh! Well, for this topic at least.
</p><p>
The challenge started out as trying to make words from a combination of letter
blocks. You know, the wooden blocks that babies play with (or,
alternatively, hurl at you if you're within 20 feet of them). Those
give you six letters per space, but I simplified the problem down to the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span> tiles example: you have a set of letters on
your rack; what words
can you make with them?
</p><p>
I've talked about algorithms for the last few months, so this time,
let's really dig in to the code for findwords, the resultant script.
After discarding various solutions, the one I've implemented has two
phases:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Identify a list of all words that are composed only of
the letters started with (so &ldquo;axe&rdquo; wouldn't match the
starting letters abcdefg).
</p></li><li><p>
For each word that matches, check that the number of
letters needed to spell the word match up with the occurrences of letters
in the starting pattern (so &ldquo;frogger&rdquo; can't be made from
forger&mdash;but almost).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Let's have a look at the code blocks, because it turns out that this is
non-trivial to implement, but we have learned to bend The Force to do our
bidding (in other words, we used regular expressions).
</p><p>
First we step through the dictionary to identify <span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>-letter
words that don't contain letters excluded from the set, with the
additional limitation that the word is between (length&ndash;3) and (length)
letters long:

<pre     class="programlisting">

unique="$(echo $1 | sed 's/./&amp;\
/g' | tr '[[:upper:]]' '[[:lower:]]' | sort | uniq | \
fmt | tr -C -d '[[:alpha:]]')"

while [ $minlength -lt $length ]
do
  regex="^[$unique]{$minlength}$"
  if [ $verbose ] ; then
    echo "Raw word list of length $minlength for \
    letterset $unique:"
    grep -E $regex "$dictionary" | tee -a $testwords
  else
    grep -E $regex "$dictionary" &gt;&gt; $testwords
  fi
  minlength="$(( $minlength + 1 ))"
done

</pre>
</p><p>
I explained how this block works in my column in the last issue (October
2015), if you want to flip
back and read it, but really, the hard work involves the very first line,
creating the variable <tt  >$unique</tt>, which is a sorted, de-duped list of letters
from the original pattern. Given &ldquo;messages&rdquo;, for example,
<tt  >$unique</tt>
would be &ldquo;aegms&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Indeed, given &ldquo;messages&rdquo;, here are the words that are identified as
possibilities by findwords:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Raw word list of length 6 for letterset aegms:
assess
mammas
masses
messes
sesame
Raw word list of length 7 for letterset aegms:
amasses
massage
message
Raw word list of length 8 for letterset aegms:
assesses
massages
messages
</pre>
</p><p>
Clearly there's more work to do, because it's not possible to make the word
&ldquo;massages&rdquo; from the starting pattern &ldquo;messages&rdquo;,
since
there aren't enough occurrences of the letter &ldquo;a&rdquo;.
That's the job of the second part of the code, so I'm just going to
show you the whole thing, and then I'll explain specific sections:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pattern="$(echo $1 | sed 's/./&amp;\
/g' | tr '[[:upper:]]' '[[:lower:]]' | sort | fmt 
 &#8618;| sed 's/ //g')"
for word in $( cat $testwords )
do
  simplified="$(echo $word | sed 's/./&amp;\
/g' | tr '[[:upper:]]' '[[:lower:]]' | sort | fmt 
 &#8618;| sed 's/ //g')"

  ## PART THREE: do all letters of the word appear 
  # in the pattern once and exactly once? Easy way: 
  # loop through and remove each letter as used, 
  # then compare end states

  indx=1; failed=0
  before=$pattern
  while [ $indx -lt ${#simplified} ]
  do
    ltr=${simplified:$indx:1}
    after=$(echo $before | sed "s/$ltr/-/")
    if [ $before = $after ] ; then
      failed=1
    else
      before=$after
    fi
    indx=$(( $indx + 1 ))
  done
  if [ $failed -eq 0 ] ; then
    echo "SUCCESS: You can make the word $word"
  fi
done
</pre>
</p><p>
The first rather gnarly expression to create <tt  >$pattern</tt> from the specified
starting argument (<tt  >$1</tt>) normalizes the pattern to all
lowercase, sorts the
letters alphabetically, then reassembles it. In this case,
&ldquo;messages&rdquo; would become &ldquo;aeegmsss&rdquo;. Why? Because we can do
that to each of the possible words too, and then the comparison test becomes
easy.
</p><p>
The list of possible words was created in part one and is stored in the
temporary file <tt  >$testwords</tt>, so the &ldquo;for&rdquo; loop steps us through. For
each word, <tt  >$simplified</tt> becomes a similarly normalized pattern to check.
For each letter in the proposed word, we replace that letter with a dash in
the pattern, using two variables, <tt  >$before</tt> and
<tt  >$after</tt>, to stage the change so
we can ensure that something really did change for each letter. That's
what's done here:
    
<pre     class="programlisting">
after=$(echo $before | sed "s/$ltr/-/")
</pre>
</p><p>
If <tt  >$before</tt> = <tt  >$after</tt>, then the needed letter from the proposed word
wasn't found in the pattern, and the word can't be assembled from the
pattern. On the other hand, if there are extra letters in the pattern after
we're done analyzing the word, that's fine. That's the
situation where we can make, for example, &ldquo;games&rdquo; from
&ldquo;messages&rdquo;, and that's perfectly valid, even with the leftover
letters.
</p><p>
I've added some debugging statements so you can get a sense of
what's going on in this example invocation:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh findwords.sh messages
Raw word list of length 5 for letterset aegms:
amass
asses
eases
games
gamma
gases
geese
mamma
sages
seams
seems
Raw word list of length 6 for letterset aegms:
assess
mammas
masses
messes
sesame
Raw word list of length 7 for letterset aegms:
amasses
massage
message
Raw word list of length 8 for letterset aegms:
assesses
massages
messages

created pattern aeegmsss
SUCCESS: You can make the word asses
SUCCESS: You can make the word eases
SUCCESS: You can make the word games
SUCCESS: You can make the word gases
SUCCESS: You can make the word sages
SUCCESS: You can make the word seams
SUCCESS: You can make the word seems
SUCCESS: You can make the word masses
SUCCESS: You can make the word messes
SUCCESS: You can make the word sesame
SUCCESS: You can make the word message
SUCCESS: You can make the word messages
</pre>
</p><p>
So, we can make a dozen different words out of the word
&ldquo;messages&rdquo;, including the word messages itself. What about the
original pattern we were using in previous columns: &ldquo;chicken&rdquo;?
For this one, let's skip the potential words and just look at the
solution:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SUCCESS: You can make the word chic
SUCCESS: You can make the word chin
SUCCESS: You can make the word heck
SUCCESS: You can make the word hick
SUCCESS: You can make the word hike
SUCCESS: You can make the word inch
SUCCESS: You can make the word neck
SUCCESS: You can make the word nice
SUCCESS: You can make the word nick
SUCCESS: You can make the word check
SUCCESS: You can make the word chick
SUCCESS: You can make the word chink
SUCCESS: You can make the word niche
SUCCESS: You can make the word chicken
</pre>
</p><p>
Impressive!
</p><p>
To make this work a bit better, I've added some error checking,
included an <tt  >-f</tt> flag so we can have the script also output
failures, not just successes, and left in some additional debugging output
if <tt  >$verbose</tt> is set to true.
</p><p>
See Listing 1 for the complete code. It's also available at <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/extra/findwords" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/extra/findwords</a>.
</p><p>
That's it. Now we have a nice tool that can help us figure out what
to play the next time we're stuck on <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Words with Friends</em></span>, or
even looking at a big stack of letter blocks.
</p><p>
Next month, I'll turn my attention to a different scripting challenge.
