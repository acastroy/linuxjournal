in stable form for nearly a month&mdash;and from everything I can tell,
it's definitely ready for prime time. While there are other
open-source HTTP servers, Apache is definitely the best known and
best supported. Apache is used on 60% of the web sites in the
world, comes with virtually every Linux distribution and is even
part of several commercial application servers. Both Zope and
Jakarta-Tomcat have their own built-in HTTP servers, but almost no
one exposes these servers directly to the Web. Rather, they use
Apache as a front end because of its combination of performance and
flexibility. This month, we take a closer look at Apache 2.0 [see
also &ldquo;Apache 2.0: the Internals of the New, Improved 'A PatCHy&rdquo;',
available at
<a href="../000/4559.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/4559</a>].
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a6580.0x279e608"></a>Architecture</h2></div></div><p>If you are familiar with Apache 1.x, then very few things in
Apache 2.0 will surprise you. For starters, Apache continues to be
highly modularized, allowing you to include only those modules that
you deem necessary in your server. But whereas Apache 1.3 had a
core module that included the basic HTTP implementation, Apache 2.0
has delegated even more supported protocols to modules. This has a
number of advantages, including the fact that we can now add (and
subtract) protocols as necessary from Apache. In other words,
Apache has now become a general-purpose internet server, rather
than just an HTTP server. How many projects will take advantage of
this functionality remains to be seen.</p><p>Apache was never meant to be the fastest server on the
planet. Rather, it was designed to be extensible via a system of
modules. Each module provided a different piece of functionality;
administrators interested in squeezing the last ounce of power from
their systems don't have to include irrelevant modules. For
example, if we know that our server will never run any CGI
programs, then we can easily remove mod_cgi, gaining some CPU
cycles and memory in the process.</p><p>Apache 2.0 continues in the long-standing Apache tradition of
handling each HTTP transaction in a number of named phases. A
module may examine or modify the transaction during any one of
these phases by attaching its own handler to the appropriate hook.
For example, mod_speling (which corrects capitalization and
spelling mistakes in URLs&mdash;the name is purposely misspelled)
attaches its handler to the &ldquo;fixup&rdquo; phase hook, executing
immediately before the server generates a response.</p><p>In Apache 1.x, only one handler could fire for a given hook.
In Apache 2.0, each handler not only registers itself for a given
hook, but indicates when it would like to execute relative to other
modules; mod_speling, for example, registers its handler as the
final (APR_HOOK_LAST). If another module were to register with the
fixup handler, it would execute before mod_speling. The fact that
multiple handlers can fire for a given hook opens a world of
possibilities that were previously too difficult to achieve.</p><p>On a similar note, Apache now makes it possible for one
module to filter, or modify, the output of another module. This is
currently possible with mod_backhand, but that module depends on a
number of tricks and dark corners in the Apache API. Apache 2.0 is
designed to allow modules to act as input or output filters. This
means that if you want to add a standard set of headers or footers
to your HTML pages, you can now do this across the board, including
for dynamically generated pages created by CGI programs,
server-side includes and mod_perl handlers.</p><p>The Apache configuration system now uses GNU autoconf rather
than the Apache-specific system that was in use for versions 1.x.
And, many of the C-language abstractions (such as hash tables and
strings) that were included in previous versions of Apache have now
been named the Apache Portable Runtime (APR). The APR is included
with Apache and is configured and compiled into the server
automatically when you build it.</p><p>Finally, Apache now comes with mod_ssl, which provides SSL
and TLS encryption. Not only did Apache 1.x fail to come with such
a module, but the two modules (Apache-SSL and mod_ssl) were
incompatible and required patching the Apache source code before
installation. The fact that mod_ssl will now be a standard part of
every Apache installation is a huge relief for web site
administrators and is most welcome.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a6580.0x279e920"></a>MPMs</h2></div></div><p>UNIX systems have long had the ability to run multiple
processes simultaneously. I typically run Emacs, a GNOME terminal
and Galeon on my Linux box; while a casual glance might only reveal
these three processes, there are actually dozens more (sendmail,
gnome-panel, Apache, syslogd and the like) that are executing
without my direct knowledge. For a complete list of what is running
on my computer, I can use the command <b  >ps
aux</b>.</p><p>The good news is that the process model is simple to
understand, ensures stability on the system and is portable across
many operating systems. Unfortunately, however, processes are
relatively heavy and slow. Linux users are especially spoiled on
this front because creating a new process on Linux is a
surprisingly lightweight operation. But even on Linux, spawning a
new process can sometimes be a bit extreme.</p><p>For this reason, an alternative model of threads has grown
over the years. Using threads, a single process can be executing in
multiple places at the same time. Threads offer many of the
benefits of processes without the overhead. But there is a cost:
programming with threads can be extremely tricky because it's
always possible that a particular piece of code is executing in two
different threads. You can always write (or rewrite) code to be
threadsafe, but this is often a difficult task.</p><p>Because threads were both difficult and tricky to handle, and
because Apache was originally designed to work only on UNIX
machines, Apache 1.x worked exclusively at the process level&mdash;if
you want to handle ten simultaneous HTTP requests, then you must
have ten Apache processes running. Because it takes time to create
a new process, Apache 1.x took an idea from NCSA HTTPd, preforking
processes before they are actually needed. This means that Apache
can be a bit slow to start up, but that handling the incoming
connections does not take much time. Apache also allows
administrators to indicate how many &ldquo;spare servers&rdquo; should always
exist, adding and removing Apache processes as necessary.</p><p>Preforked Apache servers are solid, well understood and
robust. But on many systems, using processes is inferior to
threads. In particular, Windows uses threads far more than
processes, which means that by sticking with processes, Apache was
limited in its ability to penetrate the Windows market.</p><p>Apache 2.0 solves these problems with MPMs (multiprocessing
modules). Each MPM is an Apache module that handles the details of
processes and threads. On Windows, OS/2 and BeOS, this means that
you can finally run Apache using a threading mechanism that is
native to your operating system. On UNIX and Linux systems, you can
experiment with a number of different models, choosing one that is
appropriate for your needs.</p><p>The prefork MPM, which runs in exactly the same way as Apache
1.x did, is the default choice when you install Apache. Two other
choices for Linux users are: 1) worker: the number of threads rises
and falls (according to the number of incoming requests), but the
number of processes remains constant; and 2) perchild: each process
contains a fixed number of threads, but the number of such
processes rises and falls according to the number of incoming
requests.</p><p>It's too early to tell, but I expect that more MPMs will
emerge over time, and that there will be numerous modules that take
advantage of threads to pool database connections, share
application data and spawn asynchronous tasks in the
background.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a6580.0x279ece8"></a>Configuring and Installing Apache</h2></div></div><p>Retrieve the latest source code from
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd" target="_self">httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd</a>;
the latest version as of this writing is 2.0.35. Unpack the source
code in a temporary directory:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /tmp
tar zxvf httpd-2.0.35.tar.gz
</pre><p>You may now run the configure program with one or more
arguments. These arguments fall into roughly four categories: 1)
Into which directories should Apache be installed? 2) Which MPM do
you want to use? 3) Under which user ID should CGI programs
execute? 4) Which modules do you want to install? And of those,
which should be installed dynamically (using shared libraries)
rather than statically?
</p><p>You can get a full list of configuration options by typing
<b  >./configure --help</b>. This is particularly true if
you want to include a module that isn't included by default. The
biggest change in configuration is that modules now have their own
options to activate them. For the simplest possible configuration
that uses the &ldquo;worker&rdquo; MPM, type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
./configure --with-mpm=worker
</pre><p>Following this, run <b  >make</b>, followed by
<b  >make install</b>. (There is no <b  >make
test</b> for Apache as of the time of this writing.) By
default, Apache 2.0 is installed into /usr/local/apache2. You can
start it using the same program as Apache 1.x, apachectl, which is
normally in /usr/local/apache2/bin/:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start
</pre>


The server will soon start up. HTML documents will normally be kept
in /usr/local/apache2/htdocs, so you should already be able to put
HTML documents there and view them.
</p><p>Apache's runtime configuration remains dependent on a text
file, normally called httpd.conf. If you are familiar with Apache
1.x, then you will be happy to know that almost all of the existing
directives will continue to work. The main directives that you will
have to learn are those that pertain to threading, assuming that
you use the worker or perchild MPMs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a6580.0x279f210"></a>Should I Switch?</h2></div></div><p>When the Apache Software Foundation announced Apache 2.0, the
announcement explicitly said that the new version is the most
stable and recommended version for production use. And for the most
part, I believe them;
<a href="http://www.apache.org" target="_self">www.apache.org</a> receives
many more requests per day than my server, and they have been
running Apache 2.0 beta versions for over a year. Thus, it's safe
to say that Apache 2.0 is stable enough for most sites to
use.</p><p>The main reason to avoid switching to Apache 2.0 at this
point is if you need mod_perl or PHP; they are currently still in
testing but will probably be available by the time you read
this.</p><p>As I mentioned above, however, it's hard to get threading
right, and this is particularly true in Perl, which has
experimented with a number of threading models in the last few
years. If you have compiled Perl with ithreads, then you can use it
to create a mod_perl for Apache 2.0 that uses the worker or
perchild MPMs. But just how stable this configuration will be
remains to be seen; it may well be that mod_perl users will choose
to stick with the prefork MPM for now, until the dust settles a
bit.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a6580.0x279f420"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Apache 2.0 comes with more of everything that a web developer
would want&mdash;more modules, more flexibility and greater speed. If
you haven't yet tried Apache 2.0, I encourage you to download it
and test it with your site's configuration to verify that it will
be a good choice.</p><p><a href="6022s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
