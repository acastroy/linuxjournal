    Some simple rules, written and unwritten, to ensure that
    other kernel users understand your work.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1490580.0x1588500"></a></h2></div></div><p>As more people and companies start to
write Linux kernel code, understanding acceptable kernel
programming coding style and conventions is very important. This
article starts out by explaining the written kernel coding style,
as documented in the kernel's Documentation/CodingStyle file, and
then moves on to introduce some of the &ldquo;unwritten&rdquo; kernel coding
style rules.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1490580.0x1588608"></a>Why Rules?</h2></div></div><p>Why are there kernel programming style rules in the first
place? Why not just let authors code in whatever style they want,
and let everyone live with it? After all, code formatting does not
affect memory use, execution speed or anything else a normal user
of the kernel would see. The reason for rules can be summed up with
this passage from Elliot Soloway and Kate Ehrlich's article (see
Resources):</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Our studies support the claim that knowledge of
programming plans and rules of programming discourse can have a
significant impact on program comprehension. In their book called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Elements of Style</em></span>, Kernighan and Plauger also
identify what we would call discourse rules. Our empirical results
put teeth into these rules: it is not merely a matter of aesthetics
that programs should be written in a particular style. Rather there
is a psychological basis for writing programs in a conventional
manner: programmers have strong expectations that other programmers
will follow these discourse rules. If the rules are violated, then
the utility afforded by the expectations that programmers have
built up over time is effectively nullified.</p></blockquote></div><p>There have been a number of other studies about how a large
body of code written in a common style directly affects how easy it
is to understand the code, review it and revise it quickly.
</p><p>Because the number of developers that look at the Linux
kernel code is very large, it is in the best interest for the
project to have a consistent style guideline. This allows the code
to be easier to understand by both someone reading it for the first
time and for someone revisiting his or her old code a number of
months later. It also allows someone else to read easily,
understand and potentially fix and enhance your code, which is one
of the greatest strengths of open-source code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1490580.0x15888c8"></a>What Are the Rules?</h2></div></div><p>So now that we have an understanding of why there should be
rules, what are they? Linus Torvalds and other kernel programmers
have written a short document that details some of the kernel
programming rules. This document is located in the
Documentation/CodingStyle file in the kernel source tree. It is
required reading for anyone who wants to contribute to the Linux
kernel. The following is a summary of these rules.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1490580.0x15889d0"></a>Indentation</h2></div></div><p>All tabs are eight characters and will be the &lt;TAB&gt;
character. This makes locating where different blocks of code start
and end easier. If you find that your code is indented too deeply,
with more than three levels of indentation that cause the code to
shift to the right of the screen too far, then you should fix
this.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1490580.0x1588ad8"></a>Placing Braces</h2></div></div><p>The original authors of UNIX placed their braces with the
opening brace last on the line, and the closing brace first on the
line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if (x is true) {
        we do y
}
</pre><p>Therefore, the Linux kernel uses this style. The exceptions
to this rule are functions, which have the opening brace at the
beginning of the line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
int function(int x)
{
        body of function
}
</pre>


Again, this is how Kernighan and Ritchie wrote their code.
</p><p>For good examples of proper indentation and brace style, look
at any of the fs/*.c files or anything in the kernel/*.c files.
Generally, most of the kernel is in the proper indentation and
brace style, but there are some notable exceptions. The code in
fs/devfs/*.c and drivers/scsi/qla1280.* are good examples of how
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to do indentation and braces.</p><p>A script can be used to run the indent program if you have to
convert a large amount of code to the correct format. This file is
located at scripts/Lindent in the kernel source tree.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1490580.0x1588df0"></a>Naming</h2></div></div><p>Your variables and functions should be descriptive and
concise. Don't use long flowery names like,
CommandAllocationGroupSize or
DAC960_V1_EnableMemoryMailboxInterface() but rather, cmd_group_size
or enable_mem_mailbox(). Mixed-case names are frowned upon, and
encoding the type of the variable or function in the name (like
&ldquo;Hungarian notation&rdquo;) is forbidden.</p><p>Global variables should be used only if they are absolutely
necessary. Local variables should be short and to the point. Valid
local loop variable names include &ldquo;i&rdquo; and &ldquo;j&rdquo;, while
&ldquo;loop_counter&rdquo; would be too verbose; &ldquo;tmp&rdquo; is allowed for any
short-lived temporary variable.</p><p>Again, good examples of proper names can be found in fs/*.c.
A lot of driver code has bad variable names, as it has been ported
from other operating systems. Examples of how
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to name functions and variables include
drivers/block/DAC960.* and drivers/scsi/cpqfs*.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1490580.0x1589000"></a>Functions</h2></div></div><p>Functions should do only one thing and do it well. They
should be short and hopefully contain only one or two screens of
text. If you have a function that does a lot of small things for
different cases, it is acceptable to have a longer function. But if
you have a long, complex function, you have a problem.</p><p>In addition, a large number of local variables within a
function is a measure of how complex the function is. If the number
of local variables exceeds ten, then there is something
wrong.</p><p>Again, there are a lot of good examples of nice-sized
functions in the fs/*.c and other kernel core code. Some bad
examples of functions can be found in drivers/hotplug/ibmphp_res.c
(where one function is 370 lines long) or drivers/usb/usb-uhci.c
(where one function has 18 local variables).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1490580.0x15891b8"></a>Comments</h2></div></div><p>Comments are good to have, but they have to be useful. Bad
comments explain how the code works, who wrote a specific function
on a specific date or other such useless things. Good comments
explain what the file or function does and why it does it. They
should also be at the beginning of the function and not necessarily
embedded within the function (you are writing small functions,
right?).</p><p>Now there is also a standard format for function comments. It
is a variant of the documentation method used by the GNOME Project
for its code. If you write your function comments in this style,
the information in them can be extracted by a tool and made into
standalone documentation. This can be seen by running <b  >make
psdocs</b> or <b  >make htmldocs</b> on the kernel
tree to generate a kernel-api.ps or kernel-api.html file containing
all of the public interfaces to the different kernel
subsystems.</p><p>This style is documented in the file
Documentation/kernel-doc-nano-HOWTO.txt and scripts/kernel-doc. The
basic format is as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/**
 * function_name(:)? (-
(* @parameterx: (
(* a blank line)?
 * (Description:)? (
 * (section header: (
(*)?*/
</pre><p>The short function description cannot run multiple lines, but
the other descriptions can (and they can contain blank lines). All
further descriptive text can contain the following markups:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>funcname(): function</p></li><li><p>$ENVVAR: environment variable</p></li><li><p>&amp;struct_name: name of a structure (up to two
words, including struct)</p></li><li><p>@parameter: name of a parameter</p></li><li><p>%CONST: name of a constant</p></li></ul></div>

</p><p>So a simple example of a function comment with a single
argument would be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/**
 * my_function - does my stuff
 * @my_arg: my argument
 *
 * Does my stuff explained.
 **/
</pre><p>Comments can and should be written for structures, unions and
enums. The format for them is much like the function format:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/**
 * struct my_struct - short description
 * @a: first member
 * @b: second member
 *
 * Longer description
 */
struct my_struct {
    int a;
    int b;
};
</pre>


Some good examples of well-commented functions can be found in the
drivers/usb/usb.c file, where all global functions are documented.
The file arch/i386/kernel/mtrr.c is a good example of a file with a
reasonable amount of comments, but they are in the incorrect
format, so they cannot be extracted by the documentation tools. A
good example of how <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to create the comment
blocks for your functions is drivers/scsi/pci220i.c.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1490580.0x1589a50"></a>Data Structure Requirements</h2></div></div><p>A chapter on data structures showed up in the 2.4.10-pre7
kernel. It goes into how every data structure that can exist
outside of a single-threaded environment needs to implement
reference counting in order to handle the memory management issues
of the structure properly. If you add reference counting to your
structure, you can avoid a lot of nasty locking issues and race
conditions. Multiple threads can access the same structure without
having to worry that a different thread will free the data from
under it.</p><p>The last sentence in this chapter is required reading by any
kernel developer: &ldquo;Remember: if another thread can find your data
structure, and you don't have a reference count on it, you almost
certainly have a bug.&rdquo;</p><p>A good example of why reference counting is necessary can be
found in the USB data structure, &ldquo;struct urb&rdquo;. This structure is
created by a USB device driver, filled with data, sent to a USB
host controller where it will be processed and eventually sent out
over the wire. When the host controller is finished with the urb,
the original device driver will be notified. While a host
controller driver is processing the urb, the original driver can
try to cancel the urb or even free it. This led to numerous bugs in
the core USB subsystem and different drivers. It also created long,
detailed arguments on the linux-usb-devel mailing list about when
in the life span of a urb it was allowed to be touched by either
driver. In the 2.5 kernel series, struct urb had a reference count
added to it, and the USB core and USB host controller drivers had a
small amount of code added to handle the reference count properly.
Now, whenever a driver wants to use the urb, a reference count is
incremented. When it is finished with it, the reference count is
decremented. If this was the last user, the memory is then freed
and the urb disappears. This allows the USB device drivers to
simplify their urb-handling logic vastly, fixes a lot of different
race condition bugs and quiets all arguments about the
topic.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1490580.0x1589c08"></a>Unwritten Rules</h2></div></div><p>If you follow the above set of rules, your code will look
like good Linux kernel code. However, quite a few unwritten rules
and style guidelines exist that good kernel code follows. Here are
some of them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1490580.0x15805a0"></a>Avoid NIH Syndrome</h2></div></div><p>A wide variety of well-designed, well-documented and
well-debugged function and data structures can be found within the
kernel. Please take advantage of them, and do not reinvent your own
version of them just because you did not write them. Among the most
common of these are the string functions, the byte order functions
and the linked list data structure and functions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1490580.0x15806a8"></a>String Functions</h2></div></div><p>In the file include/linux/string.h, a number of common string
handling functions are defined. These include strpbrk, strtok,
strsep, strspn, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strcmp, strncmp,
strnicmp, strchr, strrchr, strstr, strlen, strnlen, memset, memcpy,
memove, memscan, memcmp and memchr. And a number of &ldquo;simple&rdquo;
string functions are defined in the file, include/linux/kernel.h:
simple_strtoul, simple_strtol, simple_strtoull and simple_strtoll.
So, if you need any type of string functionality in your kernel
code, please use the built-in functions. Do not try to rewrite the
existing functions accidentally.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1490580.0x15807b0"></a>Byte Order Handling</h2></div></div><p>Do not rewrite code to switch data between different endian
representations. The file include/asm/byteorder.h (asm will point
to the proper subdirectory, depending on your processor
architecture) will bring in a wide range of functions that allow
you to do automatic conversions, regardless of the endian format of
your processor or your data.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1490580.0x15808b8"></a>Linked Lists</h2></div></div><p>If you need to create a linked list of any kind of data
structure, use the code that is in include/linux/list.h. It
contains a structure, struct list_head, that should be included
within the structure of which you want to create a list. Then you
will be able to add, remove or iterate over a list of data
structures easily, without having to write new code.</p><p>Some good examples of code that uses the list structure can
be found in drivers/hotplug/pci_hotplug_core.c and
drivers/ieee1394/nodemgr.c. Some code in the kernel that should be
using the list structure can be found in the ATM core, within the
struct atm_vcc data structure. Because the ATM code did not use
struct list_head, every ATM driver needs to walk the lists of data
structures by hand, duplicating a lot of code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1490580.0x1580a18"></a>typedef Is Evil</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>typedef</b></span> should not be used
in naming any of your structures. Most main kernel structures have
no typedef. Though this would shorten their usage, it obscures
code. For example, the core kernel structures struct inode, struct
dentry, struct file, struct buffer_head, struct user and struct
task_struct have no typedef.</p><p>Using a typedef only hides the real type of a variable. There
are records of some kernel code using typedefs nested up to four
layers deep, preventing the programmer from easily telling what
type of variable they are actually using. If the programmer does
not realize the size of the structure it can cause very large
structures to be accidentally declared on the stack or to be
returned from functions.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>typedef</b></span> also can be used as
a crutch to keep from typing long structure definitions. If this is
the case, the structure names should be made shorter, according to
the above-listed naming rules.</p><p>Never define a typedef to signify a pointer to a structure,
as in the following example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
typedef struct foo {
        int bar;
        int baz;
} foo_t, *pfoo_t;
</pre><p>This hides the true type of the variable and uses the name of
the variable type to define what it is (see the previous comment
about Hungarian notation).
</p><p>Some examples of where typedefs are used badly are in the
include/raid/md*.h files, where every structure has a typedef
assigned to it, and in the drivers/acpi/include/*.h files, where a
lot of the structures do not even have a name assigned to them,
only a typedef.</p><p>The only place that using typedef is acceptable is in
declaring function prototypes. These can be difficult to type out
every time, so declaring a typedef for these is nice to do, for
example, the bh_end_io_t typedef that is used as a parameter in the
init_buffer() call. This is defined in include/fs.h as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
typedef void (bh_end_io_t)
    (struct buffer_head *bh, int uptodate);
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1490580.0x1580e90"></a>No ifdefs in .c Code</h2></div></div><p>With the wide number of different processors, different
configuration options and variations of the same base hardware
types that Linux runs on, it is easy to start having a lot of
#ifdef statements in your code. This is not the proper thing to do.
Instead, place the #ifdef in a header file, and provide empty
inline functions if the code is not to be included.</p><p>As an example, consider the following code in
drivers/usb/hid-core.c:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
static void hid_process_event (struct hid_device *hid,
                               struct hid_field *field,
                               struct hid_usage *usage,
                               __s32 value)
{
   hid_dump_input(usage, value);
   if (hid-&gt;claimed &amp; HID_CLAIMED_INPUT)
         hidinput_hid_event(hid, field, usage, value);
#ifdef CONFIG_USB_HIDDEV
   if (hid-&gt;claimed &amp; HID_CLAIMED_HIDDEV)
         hiddev_hid_event(hid, usage-&gt;hid, value);
#endif
}
</pre><p>Here the author does not want to call hiddev_hid_event() if a
specific configuration option is not enabled. This is because that
function will not even be present if the configuration option is
not enabled.
</p><p>To remove this #ifdef, the following change was made to
include/linux/hiddev.h:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#ifdef CONFIG_USB_HIDDEV
   extern void hiddev_hid_event (struct hid_device *,
                                 unsigned int usage,
                                 int value);
#else
   static inline void
   hiddev_hid_event (struct hid_device
*hid,
                     unsigned int usage,
                     int value) { }
#endif
</pre><p>Then drivers/usb/hid-core.c was changed to:
<pre     class="programlisting">
static void hid_process_event
                           (struct hid_device *hid,
                            struct hid_field *field,
                            struct hid_usage *usage,
                            __s32 value)
{
   hid_dump_input(usage, value);
   if (hid-&gt;claimed &amp; HID_CLAIMED_INPUT)
         hidinput_hid_event(hid, field, usage, value);
   if (hid-&gt;claimed &amp; HID_CLAIMED_HIDDEV)
         hiddev_hid_event(hid, usage-&gt;hid, value);
}
</pre>


If CONFIG_USB_HIDDEV is not enabled, the compiler will replace the
call to hiddev_hid_event() with a null function call and then
optimize away the if statement entirely. This keeps the code
readable and easier to maintain over time.
