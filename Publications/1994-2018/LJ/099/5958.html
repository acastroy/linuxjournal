    How to use otherwise obsolete hardware to get a working
    Linux system on multiple displays.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1436580.0x152e920"></a></h2></div></div><p>Engineering today requires a lot of
screen real estate. When you start doing circuit layouts, math
models and simulations, image processing and other engineering
work, you need room. Plotting the results from two data runs with a
package like octave is a common task and is difficult without
adequate screen room. We have reached the point where using
multiple monitors is pretty much the required baseline in order to
work.
</p><p>Fortunately, the rapid obsolescence of computer hardware has
resulted in the early retirement of otherwise good equipment. Who
doesn't have an extra video card or monitor lying around that was
state of the art a few years ago but has been passed by now? Even
if you don't, it doesn't cost much to pick up some new hardware and
really spice up your system.</p><p>We present a formula to set up a Linux system to have two or
more displays in various configurations, some lessons we learned
while doing this and some uses we've found for the system. Be
forewarned&mdash;following this formula doesn't guarantee success
because some video cards just won't work with others. As always,
please do the appropriate backups before making any system
changes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1436580.0x152ead8"></a>The Formula</h2></div></div><p>To set up your system for multiple cards, start with Red Hat
7.2, two video cards and monitors. We begin with a fresh install so
you can see each of the steps in case you've already heavily
modified your system. (Follow the spirit of these steps if you
aren't using Red Hat 7.2 or if you are modifying a working
installation.) Again, back up your data before trying any of
this.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Physically install both video cards in the system,
turn on both monitors and start the Linux installation.</p></li><li><p>Choose KDE and graphical login when you get to the
appropriate part of the installation. This isn't crucial but makes
things easier for testing and can be changed later.</p></li><li><p>Finish the installation and make sure your basic
system and the X Window System are working by rebooting and logging
in. At this time, you'll have one video card and monitor
working.</p></li><li><p>As root, launch an xterm and make sure you're in
your home directory by typing <b  >cd</b>. Then type
<b  >cp /etc/X11/XFConfig-4 .</b> to create a backup copy
of your X configuration file in your home directory, just in
case.</p></li><li><p>Now, type <b  >telinit 3</b> to switch
from runlevel 5, which uses a graphical login, to runlevel 3 with
its console login.</p></li><li><p>Time to gather some data and see if this is going
to work. Log in again as root. Type <b  >X -version</b>
and note the output. Buried in the output somewhere it will
probably say 4.1.0 but could say 3.3.6a, depending on your primary
video card. Next is the big step. Type <b  >XFree86
-configure</b> and wait for the minute or so that this
normally takes to run. Now type <b  >XFree86 -xf86config
/root/XF86Config.new</b>. If you are successful, you'll hear
clicks from both monitors as they switch modes, and the power
lights will switch from amber to green. The screens themselves will
fill with the raw X display. If they do, congratulations, you
should be able to make this setup work (note: kill X by pressing
Ctrl-Alt-Backspace). If they don't, then try a different
combination of video cards; we couldn't force systems to work that
didn't do this step successfully, but we would love to hear about
your successes with it! Now type <b  >XFree86
-scanpci</b> and record the output. Typical output:
<b  >(0:8:0) S3 Virge</b>, which is a PCI card, and
<b  >(1:0:0) NVIDIA Riva Ultra 64</b>, which is an AGP
card. Other cards and slots will be identified, but it doesn't
matter for this to work.</p></li><li><p>Configuration of X server: you need to make sure
you're calling the right X server, especially if you had an X
version less than 4 in step 6. Type <b  >ls -l
/etc/X11/X</b>. If it is a symbolic link to XFree86, you're
using the XFree86 Version 4. If it isn't, back up the link by
typing <b  >mv /etc/X11/X /etc/X11/X_orig</b>. Make the
correct link by typing <b  >ln -s /etc/X11/bin/XFree86
/etc/X11/X</b>.</p></li><li><p>Multihead configuration: at this point, you could
just copy the new X configuration file (<b  >cp
/root/XF86Config.new /etc/X11/XFConfig-4</b>), but your
resolution probably wouldn't be very good. A better approach is to
edit /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 and incorporate the knowledge gained
from going through these steps. We'll cover the fine-tuning in the
next section.</p></li><li><p>Finally, type <b  >telinit 5</b>, log in
and enjoy. If you're successful, your system will boot up and give
you a login screen. The screen on the right is your primary screen;
the left screen will come up at the end of the login
process.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1436580.0x152f738"></a>Background</h2></div></div><p>We used Red Hat 7.2 as the baseline because it has XFree86 4,
which supports multiple displays (and input devices). Commercial X
servers have supported this for a while, but XFree86 4 comes with
new Linux distributions and it's free. Version 4 threw in a new
configuration file and format to allow this flexibility. The key
section is ServerLayout, which positions one screen relative to
another. Here's an excerpt:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Section "ServerLayout"
        Identifier   "XFree86 Configured"
        Screen   0 "Screen0" 0 0
        Screen   1 "Screen1" LeftOf "Screen0"
        InputDevice  "Mouse0" "CorePointer"
        InputDevice  "Keyboard0" "CoreKeyboard"
EndSection
</pre><p>As you undoubtedly realize from this straightforward format,
this setup will configure Screen0 (the screen associated with your
primary video card) and then configure Screen1 and place it to the
left of Screen0. In other words, you would move your mouse across
Screen0, hit the left edge and then enter Screen1 from the right
side (pretty confusing if you have the monitors backward). You can
choose Right, Top, Bottom or even Relative positioning so the
screens are diagonal. Do a <b  >man XFree86</b> to get
the details. The screens don't have to be the same resolution or
even the same color depth. Make one or both virtual if you want,
though we didn't find this easy to use. Each screen in ServerLayout
is composed of a Monitor reference and Device (video card)
reference as shown below:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Section "Screen"
        Identifier "Screen0"
        Device   "Card0"
        Monitor  "Monitor0"
        SubSection "Display"
                Depth   8
                #Virtual         1024 768
        EndSubSection
EndSection
</pre>


Here's the monitor and device sections to support Screen0:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Section "Monitor"
        Identifier  "Monitor0"
        VendorName  "GWY"
        ModelName  "311"
EndSection
Section "Device"
        Identifier "Card0"
        Driver   "mga"
        VendorName "Matrox"
        BoardName  "MGA 2164W"
        BusID    "PCI:0:14:0"
EndSection
</pre>


The first key thing is to make sure everything is consistent, i.e.,
Screen0 has Monitor0 and Card0. What's important is that the names
match, not what they are. We have developed a habit of making one
set end in 0 and the next set end in 1, instead of keeping track of
the card and monitor names. It's just easier to avoid mistakes.
</p><p>The next key thing is the device driver. That gets identified
by the <b  >XFree86 -configure</b> step for both cards.
Finally, it's critical to get the BusIDs straight. It's optional
with only one card but mandatory for two or more. An AGP card will
start with a 1, not a 0, and probably will be 1:0:0.</p><p>Now you have the basics and need to fine-tune
/etc/X11/XFConfig-4 to get optimal performance. Edit this file and
interleave the data identified in /root/XFConfig-4.new. Because
we're using KDE's graphical login, you can tweak the file, log out,
restart the X server from the KDE login window, do the login and
see what happens. If you're not happy, tweak and repeat. It's much
faster than manually restarting X. See Listing 1 [available at
<a href="../listings/099/5958.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue99/5958.tgz</a>]
for a full XFConfig-4 file.</p><p>At this point, you have a working multiheaded system
utilizing the KDE graphical login and probably the KDE environment
(Figure 1). It turns out that there are four different
configurations that can be set up: GNOME or KDE login, and then the
GNOME or KDE environment. We'll go through the advantages and
disadvantages of each approach now.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5958f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Successful Multiheaded System in Action
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1436580.0x1927fb8"></a>Options</h2></div></div><p>The file /etc/sysconfig/desktop determines which login
manager is used. It's a one-line file saying
<b  >DESKTOP="GNOME"</b> or
<b  >DESKTOP="KDE"</b>. Edit as root, according to your
requirements. Here are the four configuration options:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>KDE login manager/KDE work environment (your system
is set up this way if you followed the formula). This approach
gives you two screens that can be identified by :0.0 for the
primary and :0.1 for the secondary. The screens are separate, so
you can't move windows from one screen to the other. You have a KDE
menubar for each screen. The best use for this is to devote a
screen to monitoring (error log, network activity, server room
temperature, etc.) whatever you need to keep an eye on that takes
up a lot of screen real estate. This is the original motivation for
making this work&mdash;use some old hardware to monitor network activity
and do other work without having another computer on the desk.
Since we're working with Linux and have the X Window System, it's
easy to control where the X applications appear. You could type
<b  >DISPLAY=:0.1 (bash/ksh/sh syntax)</b>, and then your
application will appear in screen :0.1. If you wanted to have just
one well-behaved X application in the other screen, type
<b  >xclock -display :0.0</b>, for example.</p></li><li><p>KDE login manager/GNOME work environment (type
<b  >switchdesk</b> from a command prompt and select
GNOME to change from the original setup). This gives you a window
manager controlling one screen and raw X on the other. You could
type <b  >/usr/X11R6/bin/mwm -display :0.1 &amp;</b> in
an xterm (ignore the warning) and get a different window manager
running in the other screen. The commands <b  >twm</b>
and <b  >fvwm2</b> also will work. This is useful for
testing purposes because you can quickly see if there are any
problems with an application by running it in the environments. As
in configuration one, the screens are separate.</p></li></ol></div><p>Configurations three and four take a different approach and
use the Xinerama extensions in XFree86 4. The authors are grateful
to Dennis Baker for his splendid HOWTO. Xinerama makes one big
screen, so it's probably the easiest and most natural way to work.
You just move the windows from one screen to another. There are two
key steps for these configurations. First, change the
/etc/sysconfig/desktop file as above. Second, in the file
/etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf, edit the line
<b  >0=/usr/bin/X11/X</b> toward the end of the file by
making it read <b  >0=/usr/bin/X11/X +xinerama</b>.
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>GNOME login/GNOME work environment with one large
connected screen. When you maximize a window it will fill its
screen.</p></li><li><p>GNOME login/KDE work environment. (Select KDE from
the login window if you just want to try KDE once.) Again, it's one
large connected screen. This time when you maximize a window it
fills the complete screen (spanning between screens).</p></li></ol></div>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1436580.0x19287f8"></a>Lessons</h2></div></div><p>Red Hat has a hardware browser application at
/usr/bin/hwbrowser that gives useful information. This is handy
under X to see if both video cards are recognized by the
system.</p><p>Some cards just don't get along. We successfully tried a
number of combinations&mdash;a matched pair of ATI Mach64 3D RAGE II PCI
cards, an ATI Mach64 AGP and Matrox II PCI card, and an S3 Virge
PCI and NVIDIA Riva TNT2 AGP card. We got those combinations
working within minutes using the above procedure. We also
unsuccessfully tried a Diamond Stealth II S220, which definitely
does not play well with others. We could not get this card to work
with another at all.</p><p>The primary video card is where the BIOS display appears and
is what gets Screen0. The video card on the highest number PCI
channel is the primary card. Some computer BIOSes give an option to
initialize the AGP card first, but this did not work for us because
the PCI card still displayed the BIOS, which is too bad, because
that level of control over the environment would be useful.</p><p>Since you have multiple screens when you use the KDE login
manager, the KDE screensaver only works on the primary screen. Set
up xscreensaver and call it in your shell initialization files
(.bashrc for example) if you want both screens to have a
screensaver. It's easy to put one screensaver on one screen and a
different one on the other using :0.0 or :0.1 in the
configuration.</p><p>Put some variable assignments in .bashrc, such as
<b  >left='-display :0.1'</b> and
<b  >right='-display :0.0'</b>. Then you can specify
which screen to use, e.g., <b  >xeyes $left</b> or
<b  >xclock $right</b>. It helps make things a little
simpler to use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1436580.0x1928bc0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Our current favorite way to work is to utilize the KDE login
and the KDE window environment. KDE seems a little cleaner as a
work environment and goes across multiple screens (remember that in
configuration two with GNOME, you have to start a second window
manager). More importantly, the KDE login gives you separate
screens so you can open up one screen for people to use
(<b  >xhost +</b> to disable access control) and still
work on the other without security concerns. Also, we tend to
devote one screen to monitoring events and displaying
things.</p><p>The formula presented here is very simple to follow, and a
working Linux system can be converted to multiple displays in under
ten minutes, if the video hardware supports it. This technique
allowed us to utilize otherwise obsolete hardware to simplify our
engineering work greatly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1436580.0x1928d78"></a>Acknowledgements</h2></div></div><p>The authors thank Gary Normandin for his insights and hard
