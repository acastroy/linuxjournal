my new issue of <i  >LJ</i> right to it to see what
you've got in store each month. The &ldquo;Hardening Sendmail&rdquo; article
[<i  >LJ</i> April 2002] was another winner. I just
wanted to point something out regarding your recommendation not to
run a sendmail d&aelig;mon if only sending mail. I used to do just
that but found something unfortunate: if a send attempt fails, then
sendmail could queue it for later delivery. If the sendmail
d&aelig;mon wasn't running, well, &ldquo;later&rdquo; would never come. I
wouldn't know about the failed delivery (especially without the
usual informative messages from sendmail after four hours, and
after five days). So, I run sendmail (postfix, actually). If you've
got a better solution, I'd love to hear it. And I'm sure other
readers would, as well.</p><p>&mdash;David</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mick
replies:</b></span> Thanks for the kind words! You're right, if
sendmail isn't running as a d&aelig;mon, queued mail will remain
queued indefinitely. I should have mentioned that common practice
is to set up sendmail to be run from cron periodically with the -q
flag. For example, this sample crontab line (adapted from one in
Olaf Kirch's Linux Network Administrator's Guide) invokes sendmail
in &ldquo;flush queue&rdquo; mode every 15 minutes:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
0,15,30,45 * * * * /usr/sbin/sendmail -q
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Obviously, that has to be in the crontab of an
account authorized to run sendmail this way&mdash;usually root. And
depending on how much outbound mail you deal in, you may not need
to run sendmail every 15 minutes&mdash;hourly may suffice. Postfix most
definitely rocks, by the way. And my friends who use qmail *really*
like qmail.</em></span>

2002 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. Since 1999, P3P
has been shown to be orthagonal to privacy, despite claims made to
the contrary. I don't really see that the W3C has done a lot to
allay fears of P3P. P3P is overly complicated and is geared toward
collection of user information, not protection of it. The only
serious difference between P3P and non-P3P sites is convenience in
giving away your personal information. It's not even a legal help:
just because a company does something illegal does not mean the
average Joe can do anything about it.</p><p>The protocol could be greatly simplified and need not have
any information about the user at all. Also, even if the protocol
forces contact information to be given to the user, there is no
easy method for the browser to determine its validity, and it is no
guarantee the company will listen. In other words, &ldquo;same ole same
ole&rdquo;, but more complex. A protocol that really is designed to
protect users' privacy will never need to know anything about users
except their privacy preferences. There is absolutely no need for
other information, yet P3P includes a large amount of detailed and
personal user information. You have to ask yourself why this has
been made so complex and so heavily geared toward data
acquisition.</p><p>&mdash;Anonymous</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry replies:</b></span> I have
already received comments to the effect that P3P doesn't ensure
privacy. Certainly nothing I said was meant to indicate that it is
a perfect solution to the problem. I just thought then, and still
do, that automated privacy protections are far more protecting of
the average internet user than the &ldquo;click here to read our privacy
policy&rdquo; that is so typical nowadays. Whether people will use even
the automated tools, or whether companies will honestly comply with
their promises, are open questions. I do know that if a web site
promises me privacy through its, and my, P3P settings, and it
subsequently releases private information about me contrary to my
express preferences, I'll sue. And if an average-Joe user comes to
me with a situation like that, I'd consider handling the case as a
class action lawsuit and demand attorney's fees.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7a580.0xc72818"></a>Minimum Distro?</h2></div></div><p>I have been a Linux user since Red Hat 4.2 and picked up my
first <i  >LJ</i> about two years ago. I have always
poked about in all the different directories and have always
wondered &ldquo;What is really required here?&rdquo; I mean, what is the
minimum requirement for a working Linux distribution, without any
user apps, just something that loads, prompts for a login, then
takes you to a shell prompt and lets you log off or shut down. No
lynx, no elm, no sendmail, no anything. I have always thought it
would be a great personal educational undertaking for myself to
attempt to create my own distribution...but I've no idea where to
begin.</p><p>&mdash;Blake Tullysmith</p><p>Yes, you can build a tiny distribution with just a kernel and
a shell. You might want to start with Brian Finley's &ldquo;Brian's Own
Embedded Linux&rdquo; and remove software from it. BOEL fits on a
floppy, and two articles about it appear on
<a href="http://embedded.linuxjournal.com" target="_self">embedded.linuxjournal.com</a>.

the F&oacute;rum Internacional do Software Livre as an
&ldquo;open-source event&rdquo; and says that the state of Rio Grande do Sul
promotes and leads in use of &ldquo;open source&rdquo;. Actually the event is
about free software (software <span   class="emphasis"><em>livre</em></span>, in
Portuguese), and the state's policy is to promote free
software.</p><p>I launched the Free Software movement in 1984 to campaign for
computer users' freedom to have a community. To make freedom and
community possible, we began developing the free software GNU
operating system, which is the basis of the GNU/Linux system that
your magazine is dedicated to. Our idealism made our community
possible.</p><p>The Open Source movement has contributed to our community,
and its supporters have a right to promote its views, but we are
not part of them. The Porto Alegre event's organizers and the
government of Rio Grande do Sul know the difference between the two
movements, and they chose the Portuguese term for &ldquo;free software&rdquo;
to say where they stand. I ask that you not label Free Software
movement supporters, our work, our events or the community we
built, with the term of the other movement. For more explanation of
the difference, see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html" target="_self">www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html</a>.</p><p>One other correction is that I will not be speaking at this
event. It was originally planned that I would, but I visited Porto
Alegre for the F&oacute;rum Social Mundial in January 2002, so we
decided it would be more interesting for Bob Chassell, cofounder of
the Free Software Foundation in 1985, to go this May instead of
me.</p><p>&mdash;Richard StallmanPresident, Free Software FoundationChief

proposes a sample Snort rule that is supposed to alert us of &ldquo;any
porn web access attempt&rdquo; from the private network. Unfortunately,
in its current form, the rule will trigger only when a user is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>posting</em></span> data containing the string &ldquo;free
porn&rdquo; since it only filters outgoing traffic. In order to detect
actual access attempts, the rule should filter the incoming
traffic:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET  80 -&gt; $INTERNAL_NET any
  (msg: "Web Porn Access Attempt";
   content:"Free porn";
   nocase; flags:A+);
