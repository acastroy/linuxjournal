    Rick surveys internet-edge devices including next-generation set-top boxes, server devices and wireless access points.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b85580.0x1c7d348"></a></h2></div></div><p>Ask a sampling of embedded Linux vendors
what they think the most likely embedded Linux &ldquo;killer apps&rdquo; are,
and you'll probably end up with a list similar to this:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Telecommunications infrastructure
(high-availability, carrier-grade systems).</p></li><li><p>Handheld mobile devices (including PDAs and smart
phones).</p></li><li><p>Wireless access points (for public 802.11 or
Bluetooth WLAN access).</p></li><li><p>Digital set-top boxes (digital TV, video and audio
systems).</p></li><li><p>Server devices (offering easy-to-use
LAN-server/firewall/gateway/router/VPN functions).</p></li></ul></div>

</p><p>Since the last three in this list&mdash;wireless access points,
set-top boxes and server devices&mdash;are all small appliance-like
&ldquo;black boxes&rdquo; that sit on the edge of the Internet and provide
access to internet-based services and resources, let's combine
those last three into one and call it &ldquo;internet-edge devices&rdquo;.
That simplifies the list into three categories of embedded Linux
killer apps: 1) telecommunications infrastructure, 2) handheld
mobile devices and 3) internet-edge devices.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b85580.0x1c7d870"></a>Telecommunications Infrastructure</h2></div></div><p>I've already covered the first of these in this column a few
months back (see &ldquo;Embedded Linux Targets Telecom Infrastructure&rdquo;
in the May 2002 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>). The
growing support for Linux in this space from telecom equipment
heavyweights HP, IBM, Motorola and Sun Microsystems leaves little
doubt that Linux is going to have a bright future in the telecom
equipment market&mdash;when the telecom market finally takes off, that
is.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b85580.0x1c7d9d0"></a>Handheld Mobile Devices</h2></div></div><p>As for the use of embedded Linux in PDAs and other handhelds,
success may well hinge on Sharp's Zaurus, the first such device to
be strongly promoted by a world leader in consumer electronics.
With the Zaurus just starting to make it into retail channels, it's
too early to predict whether the Zaurus and its Linux-based
software stack are going to be long-term winners. Rumors abound of
ongoing projects to develop Linux-based PDAs and smart phones,
particularly in Asia, so we can expect to see five to ten such
devices hit the market during the latter half of 2002.</p><p>So far, embedded Linux has not fared well in the handheld
mobile device market, with many projects being canceled and some
resulting in stillborn products. Microsoft's Pocket PC, on the
other hand, has grown steadily in market share at PalmOS' expense.
Is it too late for embedded Linux in the handhelds market? The next
six to nine months will answer that question.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b85580.0x1c7db30"></a>Internet-Edge Devices</h2></div></div><p>This brings us to the third killer app category:
internet-edge devices. Think of these as highly compact,
web-enabled server appliances having a variety of
application-specific task assignments. Given the unquestioned
success of Linux in the server space, coupled with the proven
capability of Linux to satisfy the tight resource constraints of
embedded devices, it should come as no surprise that Linux is
likely to be a big winner in this important emerging class of
products.</p><p>Let's take a look at some products in the internet-edge
devices category that use embedded Linux as their internal OS
platform.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b85580.0x1c7dc90"></a>Next-Generation Set-Top Boxes</h2></div></div><p>This class of devices spans a wide range of capabilities,
including such functions as personal video recorder functions,
video-on-demand, e-mail and web access, and streaming video and
audio media storage and playback. Here are a few embedded
Linux-based examples:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>TiVo Personal TV: need I say more?</p></li><li><p>Nokia Mediaterminal: this device adds a broad range
of internet-based services to a normal TV set. Among the services
available are digital audio/video, digital TV, video-on-demand,
cached TV programs, web access, e-mail and chatting, games/gaming
and many web-based software applications. The Mediaterminal's
internal software is based on Linux, the Mozilla open-source
browser, the X Window System, plus a unique user-interface
technology called Nokia Navi bars. The embedded computer is a
366MHz Intel Celeron CPU along with the Intel 810 chipset, plus
32MB SDRAM and a minimum 20GB hard disk. (See

home, small office and workgroup environments that are used as
local servers (for local networking and file/printer sharing) or
internet gateways (firewall, router, e-mail server, VPN, etc.).
With a built-in Linux OS and open-source web server, these gadgets
often provide point-and-click, browser-based setup and
configuration by nontechnical users, and are unburdened by the high
costs of proprietary software licenses. Here are a few embedded
Linux-based examples:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Filanet InterJak: the maker of this easy-to-use
