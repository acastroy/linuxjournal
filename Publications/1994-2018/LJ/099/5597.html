    Python 2.2 resolves some well known deficiencies of the
    language and introduces some new powerful constructs that
    are key strengths of other object-oriented languages.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a7e580.0x2b76500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Python 2.2 made its debut at the end of
2001, and its first bug-fix version 2.2.1 was recently released
from the core developers at PythonLabs. The 2.2.x family is full of
new features and capabilities, some considered significant
additions and improvements to the language. These updates give
Python developers a significant boost in terms of flexibility.
</p><p>Python is a simple yet robust language combining the ease of
scripting tools with the application-building power of compiled
object-oriented programming languages. With Jython, the
Java-compiled edition of the Python interpreter, Java programmers
are discovering a tool that raises their productivity and
development speed to a new level.</p><p>You can stay up-to-speed on these changes by reading the PEPs
(Python Enhancement Proposals), which are created to give any
reasonable idea an ear from the Python community. Before
consideration is made for any update to the language, the problems
and proposed solutions are presented along with the rationale for,
and details behind, the change. Not only can you get the exact
details on a PEP at the web site (see Resources), but you can also
find out the status of a PEP. After reaching a consensus, a subset
of PEPs is approved and slated for each release. For example, the
changes in 2.2 (meaning the entire 2.2.x set of releases) consist
primarily of five major PEPs: 234, 238, 252, 253 and 255.</p><p>For starters, 2.2 begins the process of unifying Python
integers and long integers. Integer calculations can no longer
raise overflow errors because they will automatically be cast into
longs if the value overflows. Statically nested scopes, introduced
in 2.1 and now standard, free Python from its restrictive two-scope
model (see PEP 227). Previously, one had to put <b  >from
__future__ import nested_scopes</b> at the start of the
script to enable nested scopes. Now that directive is no longer
necessary as it has become standard. Unicode support has also been
upgraded for UCS-4 (32-bit unsigned integers; see PEP 261). Minor
updates to the Python Standard Library include a new e-mail
package, a new XML-RPC module, the ability to add IPv6 support to
the socket module and the new hot-shot profiler (PEP).</p><p>The most significant changes and additions to 2.2 are
iterators and generators, changing the division operator and
unifying types and classes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a7e580.0x2b767c0"></a>Iterators</h2></div></div><p>Iterators give the programmer the ability to traverse or
&ldquo;iterate through&rdquo; elements of a data set. They are especially
useful when the items of such sets are of differing types. Python
has already simplified part of this programming process, as its
sequence data types (lists, strings, tuples) are already
heterogenous, and iterating through them is as simple as a &ldquo;for&rdquo;
loop without having to create any special mechanism.</p><p>The new iteration support in Python works seamlessly with
Python sequences but now also allows programmers to iterate through
nonsequence types, including user-defined objects. An additional
benefit is the improvement of iteration through other Python
types.</p><p>Now, that all sounds good, but why iterators in Python? In
particular, PEP 234 cites that the enhancement will:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Provide an extensible iterator interface.</p></li><li><p>Bring performance enhancements to list
iteration.</p></li><li><p>Allow for big performance improvements in
dictionary iteration.</p></li><li><p>Allow for the creation of a true iteration
interface as opposed to overriding methods originally meant for
random element access.</p></li><li><p>Be backward-compatible with all existing
user-defined classes and extension objects that emulate sequences
and mappings.</p></li><li><p>Result in more concise and readable code that
iterates over nonsequence collections (mappings and files for
instance).</p></li></ul></div><p>Iterators can be created directly by using the new iter()
built-in function or implicitly for objects that come with their
own iteration interface. For example, lists have a built-in
iteration interface, so &ldquo;for eachItem in myList&rdquo; will not change
at all.</p><p>Calling iter(obj) returns an iterator for that type of
object. An iterator has a single method, next(), that returns the
next item in the set. A new exception, StopIteration, signals the
end of the set.</p><p>Iterators do have restrictions, however. You can't move
backward, go back to the beginning or copy an iterator. If you want
to iterate over the same objects again (or simultaneously), you
have to create another iterator object.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a7e580.0x2b76ef8"></a>Sequences</h2></div></div><p>As mentioned before, iterating through Python sequence types
is as expected:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; myTuple = (123, 'xyz', 45.67)
&gt;&gt;&gt; i = iter(myTuple)
&gt;&gt;&gt; i.next()
123
&gt;&gt;&gt; i.next()
'xyz'
&gt;&gt;&gt; i.next()
45.67
&gt;&gt;&gt; i.next()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in ?
StopIteration
</pre><p>If this had been an actual program, we would have enclosed
the code inside a try-except block. Sequences now automatically
produce their own iterators, so a &ldquo;for&rdquo; loop:
<pre     class="programlisting">
for i in seq:
    do_something_to(i)
</pre>


under the covers now really behaves like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
fetch = iter(seq)
while 1:
    try:
        i = fetch.next()
    except StopIteration:
        break
    do_something_to(i)
</pre>


However, your code doesn't need to change because the &ldquo;for&rdquo; loop
itself calls the iterator's next() method.
</p><p>There is also another form of the iter() built-in function,
iter(callable, sentinel), which returns an iterator as before. The
difference is that each call to the iterator's next() method will
invoke callable() to obtain successive values and raise
StopIteration when the value sentinel is returned.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a7e580.0x2b771b8"></a>Dictionaries</h2></div></div><p>Dictionaries and files are two other Python data types that
received the iteration makeover. A dictionary's iterator traverses
its keys. The idiom &ldquo;for eachKey in myDict.keys()&rdquo; can be
shortened to &ldquo;for eachKey in myDict&rdquo;, as shown in Listing
1.</p><p><a href="5597l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Looping through a
Dictionary</a></p><p>In addition, three new built-in dictionary methods have been
introduced to define the iteration: myDict.iterkeys() (iterate
through the keys), myDict.itervalues() (iterate through the values)
and myDict.iteritems() (iterate through key/value pairs). Note that
the &ldquo;in&rdquo; operator has been modified to check a dictionary's keys.
This means the Boolean expression myDict.has_key(anyKey) can be
simplified as &ldquo;anyKey in myDict&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a7e580.0x2b773c8"></a>Files</h2></div></div><p>File objects produce an iterator that calls the readline()
method. Thus, they loop through all lines of a text file, allowing
the programmer to replace essentially &ldquo;for eachLine in
myFile.readlines()&rdquo; with the more simplistic &ldquo;or eachLine in
myFile&rdquo;:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; myFile = open('config-win.txt')
&gt;&gt;&gt; for eachLine in myFile:
...     print eachLine,   # comma suppresses extra \n
...
[EditorWindow]
font-name: courier new
font-size: 10
&gt;&gt;&gt; myFile.close()
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a7e580.0x2b77528"></a>Classes</h2></div></div><p>You can also create custom iterators for your own classes.
This allows you to avoid the hack of overloading the __getitem__()
special class method. Overloading __getitem__() implies the user
can ask for any subscript in any order. But some objects do not
logically allow this. Using an iterator rather than overloading
__getitem__() makes explicit what the user can or cannot do.</p><p>To add iteration to your classes, override the __iter__()
special method to return itself (making the object its own
iterator). Then override the next() method:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
def __iter__(self):
    return self
def next(self):
    # return next item or raise StopIteration
</pre><p>We can tweak our code for a similar example. This time, we
choose to return a random element from the sequence (Listing 2).
This example demonstrates some unusual things we can do with custom
class iterations. One is infinite iteration. Because we read the
sequence nondestructively, we never run out of elements, so we
never need to raise StopIteration.
</p><p><a href="5597l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Custom Class
Iterations</a></p><p>In Listing 3, we create an iterator object using our class,
but rather than iterating through one item at a time, we give the
next() method an argument telling how many items to return.</p><p><a href="5597l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Creating an Iterator
Object Using Our Class</a></p><p>Now let's try it out:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = AnyIter(range(10))
&gt;&gt;&gt; i = iter(a)
&gt;&gt;&gt; for j in range(1,5):
&gt;&gt;&gt;     print j, ':', i.next(j)
1 : [0]
2 : [1, 2]
3 : [3, 4, 5]
4 : [6, 7, 8, 9]
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a7e580.0x2b779a0"></a>Mutable Objects and Iterators</h2></div></div><p>Before we move on to generators, remember that interfering
with mutable objects while you are iterating them is not a good
idea. This was a problem before iterators appeared. One popular
example of this is to loop through a list and remove items from it
if certain criteria are met (or not):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
for eachURL in allURLs:
    if not eachURL.startswith('http://'):
        allURLs.remove(eachURL)            # YIKES!!
</pre><p>All sequences are immutable except lists, so the danger
occurs only there. A sequence's iterator only keeps track of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span>th element you are on, so if you change
elements around during iteration, those updates will be reflected
as you traverse through the items. If you run out, then
StopIteration will be raised, but you can continue with the
iteration if you add items to the end and resume, as shown in
Listing 4.
</p><p><a href="5597l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. Iteration
Example</a></p><p>When iterating through keys of a dictionary, you must not
modify the dictionary. Using a dictionary's keys() method is okay
because keys() returns a list that is independent of the
dictionary.</p><p>But iterators are tied much more intimately with the actual
object and will not let us play that game anymore:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; myDict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}
&gt;&gt;&gt; for eachKey in myDict:
...   print eachKey, myDict[eachKey]
...   del myDict[eachKey]
...
a 1
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in ?
RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during
              iteration
</pre><p>This will help prevent buggy code. For full details on
iterators, see PEP 234.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a7e580.0x2b6e650"></a>Generators</h2></div></div><p>Generators extend from the idea of iterators. The main
motivation for generators, however, comes from a different angle:
they allow saving state across function calls. Static variables,
such as in C functions, have the ability to maintain their value
across multiple calls of that function. This partially solves the
state problem, but what would be really nice would be to yield a
value just like an iterator but be able to freeze execution only to
resume exactly where you left off when it is called again. This is
exactly what generators do. They represent the idea of merging
iteration with state along with functions that are resumable. When
they do, they pick up right where they left off, keeping intact all
the state information they need to deliver the next item. Note that
we use the term yield here for two reasons: to hint that it's not a
true return (along with frame object stack pop) and to introduce
the new keyword yield.</p><p>For backward compatibility (in case there is code out there
that uses yield as an identifier), you must include the &ldquo;from
__future__ import generators&rdquo; directive to use generators.
Generators will become standard soon (2.3?) so importing will not
be a necessity. Generators behave in another manner similar to
iterators: when a real return or end-of-function is reached and
there are no more values to yield, a StopIteration exception is
raised. Here's a simple example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
def simpleGen():
    yield 1
    yield '2 --&gt; punch!'
</pre><p>Now that we have our function, let's call it and get a
generator object:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; myG = simpleGen()
&gt;&gt;&gt; myG.next()
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; myG.next()
'2 --&gt; punch!'
&gt;&gt;&gt; myG.next()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in ?
    myG.next()
StopIteration
</pre>


or more aptly: for eachItem in simpleGen(): print eachItem. Of
course that was a silly example. I mean, why not use a real
iterator for that? More motivation comes from being able to iterate
through a sequence that requires the power of a function, rather
than static objects already sitting in some sequence.
</p><p>In the following example, we are going to create a random
iterator that takes a sequence and returns a random item from that
sequence:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
from random import randint
def randIter(seq):
    while len(seq) &gt; 0:
        yield seq.pop(randint(0, len(seq)-1))
</pre><p>The difference is that each item returned is also consumed
from that sequence, sort of like a combination of list.pop() and
random.choice():
<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; for eachItem in randIter([123, 'xyz',
    45.678, 9j]):
...     print eachItem
...
'xyz'
9j
45.678
123
</pre>


Table 1 is a summary of the differences between iterators and
generators. You can find more details on both iterators and
generators in their respective PEPs (234 and 255).

Iterators and Generators</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a7e580.0x2b6eac8"></a>Initiating the Process of Changing the Division
Operator</h2></div></div><p>This is perhaps the most controversial update to Python so
far. There are many pros and cons, but finally those who believe in
true division have won out. To highlight this change let's define
(or redefine) some division terms and their functionality with
integer and floating-point operands.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a7e580.0x2b6ebd0"></a>Classic Division</h2></div></div><p>When presented with integer operands, classic division
truncates the decimal place, returning an integer (see the &ldquo;Floor
Division&rdquo; section below). When given a pair of floating-point
operands, it returns the actual floating-point quotient (see the
&ldquo;True Division&rdquo; section). Here is an example of what Python's
division has been and still is today (actually a mix of true and
floor division):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 / 2          # perform integer result (floor)
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.0 / 2.0      # returns real quotient
0.5
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a7e580.0x2b6ed30"></a>True Division</h2></div></div><p>This is the case where the result should always be the actual
quotient, regardless of the type of the operands. This is the big
change that is to come our way when Python 3.0 nears reality. For
now, to take advantage of true division, one must give the
<b  >from __future__ import division</b> directive. Once
that happens, the division operator ( / ) performs only true
division:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; from __future__ import division
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 / 2               # returns real quotient
0.5
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.0 / 2.0           # returns real quotient
0.5
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a7e580.0x2b6eee8"></a>Floor Division</h2></div></div><p>A new divisor operator ( // ) has been created that always
truncates the fraction and rounds it to the next smallest whole
number toward the left on the number line, regardless of the
operands' numeric types. This operator works starting in 2.2 and
does not require the __future__ directive above.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 // 2          # floors result, returns integer
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.0 // 2.0      # floors result, returns float
0.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; -1 // 2         # move left on number line
-1
</pre><p>Without getting into the arguments of this change, the
feeling is that perhaps Python's division operator has been flawed
since the beginning, especially because Python is a strong choice
as a first programming language for people who aren't used to floor
division. One of the examples Guido uses in his &ldquo;What's New in
Python 2.2&rdquo; ZPUG talk is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
def velocity(distance, totalTime):
    rate = distance / totalTime
</pre>


This is bad because this function is not numeric-type-independent.
Your results with a pair of floats certainly differs from that of
sending in a pair of integers. To bridge the dichotomy, you must
resolve the following intransitivity in your head:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 == 1.0
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 == 2.0
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 / 2 == 1.0 / 2.0            # classic division
0
</pre>


If you use Python's new model of division, the universe is at peace
once again:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; from __future__ import division
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 / 2 == 1.0 / 2.0            # true division
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 // 2 == 1.0 // 2.0          # floor division
1
</pre>


While this seems like the proper and right thing to do, one cannot
help but be concerned with the code breakage it may lead to.
Fortunately, the Python developers have kept this in mind, as this
change will not be permanent until Python 3.0, which is still years
away. Those who desire the new division can import it or start
Python with the -Qnew command-line option. There are a few options
to turn on warnings to prepare for the upcoming new division.
</p><p>You can get more information from PEP 238, but dig through
the comp.lang.python archives for the heated debates. Table 2
summarizes the division operators in the various releases of Python
and the differences in operation when you import division (from
__future__).</p><p><a href="5597t2.html" target="_self">Table 2. Division Operator

for quite a while. Programmers are dismayed to discover that they
cannot subclass existing data types, such as a list, to customize
for their applications.</p><p>To learn more, it can't hurt to look through both the PEPs
involved and a tutorial Guido wrote specifically for those who want
to get up to speed quickly on the new style classes without having
to wade through all the intricate details found in the PEPs (see
Resources). We will also give you a teaser class that extends a
Python list with enhanced stack features.</p><p>This example, stack2.py, is motivated by one of the iterator

bring Python pretty far down the path, there are those who claim
that they violate Python's simplistic nature. If you're stictly a
purist, that is probably a valid consideration. However, by finally
purging some of the annoyances and adding a few more powerful
constructs to the language, we are probably better off than we were
before. These changes will not have a negative impact on existing
code, and those that do, such as the change in the division

documents, such as Andrew Kuchlin's &ldquo;What's New in Python 2.2&rdquo;
and the slide presentation from one of Guido's talks last fall at a
Python user group meeting. Python 2.2.1 can be downloaded at the
main Python language home page. Happy hacking!</p><p><a href="5597s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
