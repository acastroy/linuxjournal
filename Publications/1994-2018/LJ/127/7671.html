Whether you're moving up from CVS or just getting serious about
a revision control system, here's a powerful tool that will
keep records of changes and keep your projects under control.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4f580.0x1f47240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Arch quickly is becoming one of the most powerful
tools in the free software developer's collection.
This is the first in a series of three articles that
teaches basic use of Arch for distributed
development, to manage shared archives and script
automated systems around Arch projects.
</p><p>
This article shows you how to get code from
a public Arch archive, contribute changesets
upstream and make a local branch of a project for
disconnected use. In addition, it provides
techniques to improve performance of both local and
remote archives.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4f580.0x1f473a0"></a>
History of Revision Control</h2></div></div><p>
Revision control is the business of change
management within a project. The ability to examine
work done on a project, compare development paths
and replicate and undo changes is a fundamental part
of free software development. With so many
potential contributors and such rapid release of
changes, the tools developers use to manipulate
these changes have had to evolve quickly.
</p><p>
Early revision control was handled with tape
backups. Old versions of a project would be dragged
out of backup archives and compared line by line
with the new copy. The process of restoring a
backup from tape is not quick, so this is not an
efficient method by any means.
</p><p>
To work around this lag, many developers kept old
copies of files around for comparison, and this was
soon integrated into early development tools.
File-based revision control, such as that used by
the Emacs editor, uses numbered backup files so
you can compare foo.c~7~ with foo.c~8~ to see
what changed. Versioned backup files even
were integrated into the filesystem on some early
proprietary operating systems.
</p><p>
For nearly two decades, the preferred format for
third-party contributions to free software projects
has been a patch file, sometimes called a diff.
Given two files, the diff program generates a
listing that highlights the differences between
them. To apply the changes specified in the diff
output, a user need only run it through the patch
program.
</p><p>
In the 1990s, the Concurrent Versions System (CVS)
became the default for managing the changes of a
core group of developers. CVS stores a list of
patches along with attribution information and a
changelog. A primitive system of branching and
merging allows users to experiment with various
lines of development and then fold successful
efforts back into the main project.
</p><p>
CVS has its limitations, and they are becoming a
burden for many projects. First, it does not
store any metadata changes, such as the permissions
of a file or the renaming of a file. In addition,
check-ins are not grouped together in a set, making
it difficult to examine a change that spanned
multiple files and directories. Finally, nearly all
operations on a remote CVS repository require that a
new connection be opened to the server, making it
difficult for disconnected use.
</p><p>
Efforts such as the Subversion Project have come a
long way toward fixing the flaws found in CVS.
Subversion is effectively a CVS++, and it supports
file metadata change logging and atomic check-ins.
What it still requires is a centralized server on
the network that all clients connect to for revision
management operations.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4f580.0x1f476b8"></a>
Distributed Revision Control Systems</h2></div></div><p>
A new generation of revision control systems has
sprung up in the past few years, all operating on
a distributed model. Distributed revision control
systems do away with a single centralized repository
in favor of a peer-to-peer architecture. Each
developer keeps a repository, and the tools allow
easy manipulation of changes between systems over
the network.
</p><p>
Projects such as Monotone, DARCS and Arch
are finding popularity in a world where free
software development happens outside of
well-connected universities, and laptops are much
more common.
</p><p>
One of the most promising distributed systems today
is GNU Arch. Arch handles disconnected use by
encouraging users to create archives on their local
machines, and it provides powerful tools for
manipulating projects between archives.
Arch lacks any sort of dedicated server process and
uses a portable subset of filesystem operations to
manipulate the archive. Archives are simply
directories that can be made available over the
network using your preferred remote filesystem
protocol. In addition, Arch supports archive access
over HTTP, FTP and SFTP.
</p><p>
One advantage to not having a dedicated d&aelig;mon is
that no new code is given privilege on your server
machine. Thus, your security concerns are with your
SSH d&aelig;mon or Web server, which most system administrators
already are keeping tabs on.
</p><p>
Another advantage is that for most tasks no root
privilege is needed to make use of Arch. Developers
can begin using it on their own machines and
publish archives without even installing Arch
on the Web server machine. This affects the pattern
of adoption as well. Using CVS or Subversion is a
top-down decision made for an entire project team,
although Arch can be adopted by one or two developers
at a time until everyone in the group is up to
speed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4f580.0x1f47920"></a>
Obtaining tla</h2></div></div><p>
Arch was originally a set of shell scripts and
wrappers around Tom Lord's hackerlabs libraries.
The name of the program in those days was larch,
and it was more than a little clumsy to use. The
client now has been entirely rewritten in C and is
called tla, which stands for Tom Lord's Arch.
The interface is still not perfect, but it is good
enough for regular use by a skilled developer.
Packages of tla are available for most GNU/Linux
distributions (see the on-line Resources).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4f580.0x1f47a28"></a>
Checking Out a Read-Only Project</h2></div></div><p>
Once you have tla installed, it's good to test it
by checking out some code. Arch stores your data in
a directory known as an archive. Within the
archive, data is organized into nested categories:
projects (the name of the work as a whole), branches
(a particular thread of development or other
descriptive term) and versions (a simple numerical
indicator you can use to indicate how far a specific
branch has progressed).
</p><p>
The first step to getting some code is to register a
public archive so that Arch associates a name with
the archive location:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tla register-archive http://www.lnx-bbc.org/arch
</pre>
</p><p>
You should now see the
lnx-bbc-devel@zork.net--gar archive listed when you
run <tt  >tla archives</tt>. If you're curious about what
projects are stored in there, you can use the <tt  >tla
abrowse</tt> command to get a full list:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tla abrowse lnx-bbc-devel@zork.net--gar
lnx-bbc-devel@zork.net--gar
  lnx-bbc
    lnx-bbc--research
      lnx-bbc--research--0.0
        base-0 .. patch-10

    lnx-bbc--stable
      lnx-bbc--stable--2.1
        base-0 .. patch-29

  scripts
    scripts--gargoyle-bin
      scripts--gargoyle-bin--1.0
        base-0 .. patch-7
</pre>
</p><p>
This listing tells us that the
lnx-bbc-devel@zork.net--gar archive has two
projects, lnx-bbc and scripts. The lnx-bbc project
has two branches, research and stable. The
lnx-bbc--research branch has only one version (0.0)
and that version has had ten changes recorded in the
archive. The lnx-bbc--stable branch has only one
version (2.1) with 29 changesets.
</p><p>
Because you now have the LNX-BBC public archive
registered in your local listing, you can check out
a copy of the LNX-BBC stable branch:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tla get \
lnx-bbc-devel@zork.net--gar/lnx-bbc--stable lnxbbc
</pre>
</p><p>
Once it finishes downloading and applying patchsets,
you should have a directory named lnxbbc/ that is
full of files. To simulate a change in the code, <tt  >cd</tt>
into lnxbbc/ and edit robots.txt to add a new
comment somewhere.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4f580.0x1f47ef8"></a>
Contributing Changes</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have made a change, running <tt  >tla
what-changed</tt> should print <tt  >M
robots.txt</tt> to
indicate that robots.txt has been modified. To get
the details of the change, you can run <tt  >tla
what-changed --diffs</tt>, which should print out a diff
file ready to be sent back to the project's
development group:

<pre     class="programlisting">
--- orig/robots.txt
+++ mod/robots.txt
@@ -1,3 +1,5 @@
+# Welcome, robots!
+
 User-agent: *
 Disallow: /garchive/
 Disallow: /cgi-bin/
</pre>
</p><p>
The drawback to this is that the diff does not
indicate metadata changes. Moved files will not be
listed, and new files will not be created when
another developer runs this diff through patch. In
order to submit a more complicated change to the
project maintainers, you must generate a changeset.
</p><p>
In Arch, a changeset is represented as a directory
tree full of bookkeeping files, patches, new files
and removed files. The best contribution technique
is to create a changeset directory and then tar it
up for delivery:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tla changes -o ,,new-robot-comment
$ tar czvf my-changes.tar.gz ,,new-robot-comment/
</pre>
</p><p>
Arch ignores files beginning with two commas, an
equal sign and a few other special characters. By
using a <tt  >,,</tt> at the start of our changeset directory
name, we avoid the annoyance of Arch complaining
that our new directory doesn't exist in the archive.
It is probably good practice to use your e-mail
address or some other identifier in the tarball
filename and changeset directory name.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4f580.0x1f48318"></a>
Keeping Up to Date</h2></div></div><p>
Now and then you'll want to download the latest
changes to the project. This is as simple as
running <tt  >tla update</tt> from inside the checked-out
copy.
</p><p>
Arch first runs <tt  >tla undo</tt> to set aside your
local changes before applying new changesets. Once
all the patches have been applied, it runs <tt  >tla
redo</tt> to re-apply your local changes.
</p><p>
All of the tla commands introduced above require a
functioning network connection to the lnx-bbc.org
system that hosts the archive. For disconnected
use, you need to create a local archive and then
make a branch within it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4f580.0x1f485d8"></a>
Setting Up an Archive</h2></div></div><p>
Before you can begin working in a read-write
archive, you must identify yourself to tla:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ tla my-id "J. Random Hacker &lt;jrh@zork.net&gt;"

</pre>
</p><p>
Once you have entered your e-mail address, it is
time to create an archive for your projects. Arch
lets you make many archives, but you can keep as
many projects and branches as you like in the same
archive.
</p><p>
Archive names have two parts, separated by two
hyphens: the first is your e-mail address, and the
second is some identifier. Many people like to use
the four-digit year as the identifier and roll over
to a new archive each year:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tla make-archive -l jrh@zork.net--2004 ~/ARCHIVE
$ tla my-default-archive jrh@zork.net--2004
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >my-default-archive</tt> command makes certain
operations on the local archive easier to type.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4f580.0x1f488f0"></a>
Setting Up a Project Branch</h2></div></div><p>
Arch encourages developers to fork and merge
projects using branches. Branches are the primary
mechanism for moving code from one archive to
another, even over a network. You can use a branch
for a complete code fork to pursue an entirely new
line of development, or you can use a branch
to cache a copy of a project on your laptop so
that you can work for a while in an environment
that lacks network access.
</p><p>
Published branches are also the primary development
communications mechanism for developers who use
Arch. Instead of mailing large changeset tarballs
or patch files around, a contributor most
likely would set up a branch to make local changes and
then invite the upstream developers to merge those
changes back into the main project. This is where
the decentralized and democratic nature of Arch's
design shines. Any developer can join the
development effort without needing special privilege
in the core team's archive.
</p><p>
Before you can branch the lnx-bbc project, you have
to set up a space for the project in your archive.
The format for a project identifier is similar to
that of the archive name: the category (or project
name), two dashes, the branch name, two dashes and
the version number. It is most likely Tom Lord's
experience as a LISP hacker that informed his
decision to use these dashes:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tla archive-setup lnx-bbc--robot-branch--0.0
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4f580.0x1f48b00"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This creates a category called lnx-bbc, a branch
called robot-branch and a version called 0.0. You
did not need to specify jrh@zork.net--2004/ in front
of the project name because that is your default
archive.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4f580.0x1f48c08"></a>
Tagging Off the Branch</h2></div></div><p>
Finally, it is time to tag off the branch from the
remote archive. This means the robot-branch
begins as a tag pointing to a particular revision
of a project in the lnx-bbc-devel@zork.net--gar
archive, and all local changes start from that
point:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ tla tag \
  lnx-bbc-devel@zork.net--gar/lnx-bbc--stable--2.1 \
  lnx-bbc--robot-branch--0.0

</pre>
</p><p>
At this point, running <tt  >tla abrowse</tt> should show your
default archive as follows:


<pre     class="programlisting">
jrh@zork.net--2004
  lnx-bbc
    lnx-bbc--robot-branch
      lnx-bbc--robot-branch--0.0
        base-0
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4f580.0x1f3f700"></a>
Working with Your New Branch</h2></div></div><p>
You are now ready to check out a copy of your new
branch:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tla get lnx-bbc--robot-branch robot-branch
</pre>
</p><p>
At this point, you can go into the robot-branch
directory and make some changes:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod 444 index.txt
$ tla mv faq.txt robofaq.txt
$ echo "ROBOT TIME" &gt; robot-time
$ tla add robot-time
$ tla rm ports.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >tla mv</tt> command renames a file in such a way
that Arch keeps track of the change. It is
important to use this command in place of the
standard mv. The <tt  >tla add</tt> command prepares a new
file to be inserted into the archive, and <tt  >tla rm</tt>
schedules removal of a file.
</p><p>
All of these changes can be checked in to
your local branch now:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tla commit
</pre>
</p><p>
Your preferred text editor (as specified in the
$EDITOR environment variable) will be started up
with a template for your check-in log. Once you have
filled out the log entry, saving and exiting
finalizes the commit.
</p><p>
Now running <tt  >tla abrowse</tt> shows that you have
two revisions of the robot branch in the archive,
base-0 and patch-1:

<pre     class="programlisting">
jrh@zork.net--2004
  lnx-bbc
    lnx-bbc--robot-branch
      lnx-bbc--robot-branch--0.0
        base-0 .. patch-1

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4f580.0x1f3fc80"></a>
Merging Projects from Two Different Archives</h2></div></div><p>
Of course, while you work on your branch,
development may have continued on the original
archive. Running <tt  >tla update</tt> fetches
changes only from your local branch and not the original
project. To fold in changes from upstream,
you need to <tt  >star-merge</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ tla star-merge \
lnx-bbc-devel@zork.net--gar/lnx-bbc--stable--2.1

</pre>
</p><p>
In the event of conflicts (situations where both
your branch and the upstream project have changes to
the same lines of code), Arch uses the standard
patch method of creating .orig and .rej files for
each file that has conflicts. It is a good idea to
use the find utility to seek out any rejects before
committing your star-merge.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4f580.0x1f3fee8"></a>
Speeding Up Archive Operations</h2></div></div><p>
You may have noticed that revisions are named either
base-0 or patch-#, where # is the number of
patches to base-0 that must be applied. Arch uses a
log-structured archive format, so that archive
operations only ever add information to a project.
This means that for big projects with many
revisions, it can take a long time for certain
tasks.
</p><p>
To speed up operations, you can make a snapshot of
a given revision. Arch snapshots are simply a
compressed tarball of a checked-out revision. When a
checkout or other operation is performed, Arch looks
for the highest-numbered snapshot and applies any
necessary patches from there:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tla cacherev
</pre>
</p><p>
Once this is finished, you can run <tt  >tla cachedrevs</tt>
to see what revisions have snapshots within your
archive:

<pre     class="programlisting">
lnx-bbc--robot-branch--0.0--base-0
lnx-bbc--robot-branch--0.0--patch-1
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4f580.0x1f401a8"></a>
Libraries</h2></div></div><p>
Because you do not always have access to create
snapshots in an archive, it can be useful to make a
local cache to speed up file operations. Arch
provides a second kind of cache, called a library,
that stores copies of checked-out files from various
revisions. This is especially helpful for remote
archives, because it means you do not even need
to download the base snapshot revision before
applying changesets:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ mkdir ~/LIBRARY
$ tla my-revision-library ~/LIBRARY
$ tla library-config --greedy ~/LIBRARY
$ tla library-add \
  lnx-bbc-devel@zork.net--gar/lnx-bbc--stable--2.1

</pre>
</p><p>
This library is not small, with the example above
comprising over 78MB as of June 2004. The
advantage over a slow link, however, is well worth
the trouble. In addition, laptops often have slow
ATA hard drives, and involved archive operations can
be a drag as the drivers use up plenty of CPU
cycles. A greedy (auto-updating) Arch library can
make your revision control operations quicker and
more responsive, even for local archives.

More to Come</h2></div></div><p>
In the next article in this series, you'll learn how
to make publicly available mirrors so that upstream
developers can star-merge back from your branches.
In addition, you'll learn how to cherry-pick
changesets from a busy branch and how to use GnuPG
to sign your changesets cryptographically for security
purposes.
</p><p>
The third and final installment of this series will
describe centralized development techniques with
Arch. You'll learn how to manage a shared access
archive using OpenSSH's SFTP protocol and how to
write scripts to perform automated tasks on your
archives.
