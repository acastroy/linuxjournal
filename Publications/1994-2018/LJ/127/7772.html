Ten years ago, Donald Becker and Thomas
Sterling built a 16-node cluster, the original
Beowulf, and started Linux and commodity hardware on
a program of relentless improvement.

In May 1965, IBM Chairman T. J. Watson, Jr., wrote of
large scientific computers, &ldquo;at some point between
two and three years ago it became evident that the
fallout from the building of such large-scale machines
was so great as to justify their continuance at almost
any cost&rdquo; (on Dr Mark Smotherman's site at
<a href="http://www.cs.clemson.edu/~mark/acs.html" target="_self">www.cs.clemson.edu/~mark/acs.html</a>).
That doesn't mean that high-performance computing
(HPC) startups have an easy time entering the
enterprise market. From Control Data to Thinking
Machines, history shows that if you concentrate on
winning in HPC, you don't get the skills to cross
over to regular business customers.
</p><p>
But ten years after the first Beowulf, examples of
what Watson called fallout are everywhere on the
Linux scene. From smoking out bad power supplies to
fixing device drivers to making manageability work
for the PC architecture, HPC customers are ruthless
in demanding tweaks to turn a rack of off-the-shelf
stuff from a maintenance nightmare to an asset.
For an IT vendor, an HPC program can work like an
automaker's racing program to test cutting-edge ideas
and get everyone fired up to win bragging rights.

Early Linux clusters were labor-intensive, with
&ldquo;crash carts&rdquo; including keyboard and monitor for BIOS
access. Today, LinuxBIOS makes the pit crew's work
feasible for more and more machines per administrator.
See Bernard Li's article on how to
take advantage of years of cluster experience
from some of the biggest, most innovative Linux
supercomputing sites (page 52).
</p><p>
And, forget about manageability for a while&mdash;let's
talk performance issues.
Paul Terry, Amar Shan and Pentti Huttunen might have
just sped up many people's work by a whole lot.
Check out their scheduler performance numbers on
page 68 and prepare for more efficient work on your
parallel jobs.

Leigh Orf has some great imagery of thunderstorms,
rendered just for this issue, and the software behind them is something you can
download and hack yourself. Get some ideas about
scientific visualization on page 62, and send us
some images.
</p><p>
This issue isn't all clusters&mdash;Andres Benitez and
Vicente Gonzales show how they turned inexpensive
non-networked air conditioners into a money-saving
system for a classroom building (page 44). And Nick
Moffitt, whose spam-fighting articles have been a
hit on the <i  >Linux Journal</i> Web site, is here with an
introduction to a new, flexible revision control
system (page 90).
</p><p>
Whether you're putting together a cluster or
enjoying the benefits of Beowulf-driven improvements
in hardware, Linux and related tools, have a great
time experimenting with all the amazing technology
and cool projects in this issue.
