The biggest Linux success story is one too few IT
workers can tell. Linux and open source are pushing
proprietary software out to the edges and taking
over the core, where the money is.

At the O'Reilly Open Source Convention (OSCon) last summer, the killer
talk wasn't one of the keynotes, although most of those were excellent.
It was a breakout session called &ldquo;Commercial OSS Business&rdquo;.
The
panel featured an A-list lineup: Matt Asay, Director of Novell's Linux
Business Office and founder of the Open Source Business Conference;
Brian Behlendorf, founder of the Apache Foundation and CollabNet;
Bob Lisbonne, a VC with Matrix Partners; Jason Matusow, Director of
Microsoft's Shared Source Initiative; and Zack Urlocker, Marketing VP
with MySQL. The moderator was Tim O'Reilly himself.
</p><p>
They all had terrific stuff to say&mdash;much of it quotable. Yet the best
contributor to the session wasn't a panelist at all, but an audience
member who grabbed the microphone, stood in front of the stage and put
on a performance worthy of Frank Sinatra fronting Tommy Dorsey's
band. It was Phil Moore, Executive Director in the UNIX Engineering team
at Morgan Stanley. He began:

</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I work for the 38th largest company in the world, Morgan
Stanley. We have a billion dollar IT budget. And we use a little of
everything. Unfortunately. Excuse me, a LOT of everything. The trend
I've seen in the last ten years...is the exponential growth in the
variety and the depth and breadth of installation of open-source
software in our infrastructure....What I'm seeing is that in the
infrastructure, the core infrastructure, open source is going to take
over, leaps and bounds....I'm predicting, right now, that by
2006 or 2007, we're going to be a 90% Linux
shop.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
He spoke for several minutes, pacing in front of the stage, addressing
both the audience and the panel. When he finished, there was applause.
</p><p>
Phil's speech was so compelling for three reasons beyond the content of
his talk. First, he was a customer rather than a
vendor. It's customary at tradeshows for vendors to fill session
panels. As good as this panel was, nothing any panelist could say
carried the authority that comes from real customers. Second, Phil
clarified market roles by making it obvious that customers are in charge
of adoption&mdash;not vendors. Third, he testified to the enormous success of
The SCO Group's &ldquo;Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt&rdquo; (FUD) campaign by being courageous enough to stand up and speak out
about it.
</p><p>
At one point in his soliloquy, Phil said, &ldquo;We're still mostly a Solaris
shop, but we are rapidly moving to Linux, though I'm not supposed to
talk about that, for fear of being sued by SCO.&rdquo; Then he turned to Matt
Asay and said, &ldquo;Which is the reason why I couldn't go to your
conference, the OSBC. I wasn't allowed to go.&rdquo; That filled a blank for
me, because Phil was slated
to be on my DIY-IT panel at OSBC and couldn't make it; now I knew why.
His cancellation brought the number of AWOL panelists to two out of the original
four. The other panelist came to the conference but was told at the
last minute by his employer that he couldn't speak, and he ended up sitting
in the audience. Significantly, the two absentees were from large
companies with buildings full of lawyers. To his and his employer's
credit, R0ml Lefkowitz of AT&amp;T Wireless did make the panel, as well as a
speech of his own given the same day at the conference.
</p><p>
But at OSCon, Phil got to speak, and the message he carried was one I've
been hearing privately from many other IT professionals:
Linux
is rapidly becoming default infrastructure, and open source is the
preferred code condition for all infrastructure.
Not that they're abandoning Microsoft&mdash;far from it. But Microsoft's
primary goods&mdash;desktop operating systems and applications&mdash;are
becoming niched to the verge of quarantine. Phil made this clear when he
turned to Jason Matusow of Microsoft and said, &ldquo;You can have the desktop.
It's a pain in the ass. I don't want it. I just want the (core) where
all the money's made.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Later he added, &ldquo;I will bet my career that Microsoft is going to get
wiped out on the desktop in the next ten years. Not in this
country.&rdquo;
Turning again to Jason, he said, &ldquo;You're going to own it here because
America loves you guys. You're set, for at least ten years.&rdquo; Turning
back to the audience, he continued:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Look overseas at what's happening
[with Linux]. It doesn't matter what distribution. Because [Linux is]
economical for people in foreign countries. It lets them invest in their
own local software companies without putting money into these guys'
pockets [indicates Microsoft] or some other foreign corporation that
doesn't have a vested interest in your own economy and your own culture.
That's going to be the number one reason why open source ends up taking
over the planet.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
As for other vendors serving the IT space, he said, &ldquo;I think
you'll see proprietary companies shifted out to the leaf nodes, coming
up with special-purpose applications that are difficult to do on a large
scale.&rdquo;
But in his current role as an enterprise IT architect, Phil Moore still
supports Microsoft desktops in the midst of a growing infrastructure
comprised of Linux and other open-source building materials. And, he
expects to maintain that relationship for the foreseeable future.
</p><p>
While Phil and the others were talking, I realized that open source and
the proprietary software industry are at crossed
purposes only where they compete outright. But when Linux and open-source
products serve as infrastructural support, Microsoft OSes and apps are
supported along with everything else.
</p><p>
In conversations that followed, out in the halls at OSCon and in
subsequent meetings at OSCon and LinuxWorld Expo, which followed the
next week, I began to visualize the subject, starting with the
traditional industrial market model.
This model was best described by John Perry Barlow in his 1995 essay
&ldquo;Death From Above&rdquo;, which argued against the asymmetrical bandwidth
delivery plants that the cable and phone companies then were
beginning to build out. Here's how it begins:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Over the last 30 years, the American CEO Corps has included an
astonishingly large percentage of men who piloted bombers during
World War II. For some reason not so difficult to guess, dropping
explosives on people from commanding heights served as a great place
to develop a world view compatible with the management of a large
post-war corporation.
</p><p>
It was an experience particularly suited to the style of broadcast
media. Aerial bombardment is clearly a one-to-many, half-duplex
medium, offering the bomber a commanding position over his
&ldquo;market&rdquo;
and terrific economies of scale.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
This industrial tradition has a number of ideals. The most obvious one
is to sell unique and proprietary products to the largest number of
people. Less obvious, but no less important, is to create and sustain
market categories populated with intermediaries and to hold as many
dependents as possible&mdash;from distributors and OEMs on down to
customers&mdash;captive on the manufacturer's platform.
</p><p>
The Open Source and Free Software movements are
driven by ideals that are roughly orthogonal to
the few-to-many model. To describe those ideals,
also found in the Internet's original architecture,
it helps to start with the qualities of open-source
products:
nobody owns them,
everybody can use them and
anybody can improve them.
It's tempting to call this Peer to Peer, but
to is not the operative
preposition here. Hacking may involve the transport of packets, but the
collaborative activities involved are with, not
to.
</p><p>
Juxtapose any with any on few to many, and you can see the
cross-purposed result.
It's easy to see how this presents a problem, not only for software
giants such as Microsoft but for few-to-many empires including
the entertainment industry and consumer electronics.
Protecting few-to-many from any with any has become a cause for the whole entertainment
industry. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, lobbied through Congress
in 1998, is landmark achievement in paranoia.
</p><p>
Yet now large customers such as Morgan Stanley show us we misconceive the
market when we see only conflict between open-source and proprietary
software business imperatives. They make this clear when they put any
with any in a supportive position beneath few to many.
By its relationship-agnostic nature, any
with any can include and support peer to peer, many to many, business to
business or any other pair of nouns flanking a preposition.
</p><p>
If Linux is infrastructure, where does infrastructure fit? This
question matters, because it provides the context within which paranoid
few to many forces attempt to control infrastructure and prevent any
with any from working.
</p><p>
That context is best described in the &ldquo;layers of time&rdquo; diagram from the
Long Now Foundation that we first visited in May 2002.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7730f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Long Now Foundation's &ldquo;Layers of Time&rdquo; Diagram
</p></div></div><p>
This is a model of basic dependencies, as well as a way to sort out
differences in rates of change. Each higher level depends on the one
below it. That's how the few-to-many system, which operates at the
Commerce level, depends on Infrastructure. It's also why commercial
interests often work to control infrastructure one layer below, at the
Governance level, often with great success. In fact, regulatory systems
around the world have served commercial interests for centuries.
</p><p>
Open-source infrastructure, however, was established at fashion-level
speeds&mdash;faster than industrial establishments could react in most
cases. Given the amorphous and ungovernable nature of the Net,
regulating it presented a severe challenge. Plus, it brought too many
benefits. Today, it's a risk for companies <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to
take advantage of any-with-any infrastructure.
</p><p>
The single unqualified lobbying success against any-with-any was the
DMCA, a big, bad, dumb piece of legislation that needs to be repealed.
Meanwhile, plenty of badness still is reposing in old copyright
and patent law. Without that badness, SCO's FUD campaign would not have
been so successful. And that success is much more widespread than it
appears, precisely because it's working. With the rare exception of guys
like Phil Moore, IT workers at big companies aren't telling Linux
success stories.
</p><p>
I've avoided writing about SCO ever since it made news by suing IBM
early last year. First, I believed SCO had no case.
Second, given this column's
three-month lead time, writing about the subject seemed pointless. But
paranoia about discussing Linux and open source has become a prevailing
condition inside large companies. Legal departments began putting IT
workers and everybody else under gag orders as soon as SCO began suing
large customers, such as Daimler-Chrysler. This has caused a news hole of
massive dimensions, even though it's not especially visible at
vendor-centric conferences or in vendor-driven publications.
</p><p>
So, although everybody continues to handicap the futures market in Linux
desktops, the real challenge is talking about how successful Linux
really is in the enormous and far more important market for
enterprise infrastructure.
