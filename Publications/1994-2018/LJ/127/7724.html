Heather Mead</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #127, November 2004</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x267b138"></a></h2></div></div><p>
We know the timing of this article puts us at a disadvantage. It's
November of a US presidential election year, and it's hard for
our Readers' Choice awards to compete.
But, we know you've been waiting to find out whether C beat C++ for Favorite Programming
Language and where Gentoo fell in the top three in the Favorite
Distribution category. It's time for the awards.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x267b240"></a>
Favorite E-Mail Client</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Mozilla
</p></li><li><p>
Ximian Evolution
</p></li><li><p>
KMail
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Once again, the top three choices in this category were GUI-based
clients. The only difference between this year's top three and last
year's is the order: Mozilla jumped to first place from third, Evolution
dropped to second and KMail dropped to third. The fifth-place
finisher came from the write-in votes&mdash;the new Mozilla
Thunderbird was only a few votes shy of fourth-place mutt this year.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x267b5b0"></a>Favorite Distribution</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Debian GNU/Linux</p></li><li><p>Mandrakelinux</p></li><li><p>Gentoo</p></li></ol></div><p>
Debian won first place for the second year in a row, picking up almost 300
more votes than second-place Mandrakelinux. Last year's number two, Red
Hat, fell to fourth this year, as Gentoo cracked the top three to come
in third. The most popular write-in vote was Red Hat's all-free,
community-oriented Fedora, coming in at number
eight.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x267b920"></a>Favorite Desktop Workstation</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Homemade</p></li><li><p>HP xw8200 Linux Workstation</p></li><li><p>Monarch Athlon 64 System Special</p></li></ol></div><p>
Seventy-five percent of voters agreed with the sentiments of the reader
who voted for his &ldquo;bastard child of desire and
affordability&rdquo;, the
ever-popular homemade desktop workstation. Like proud parents rattling off
the list of talents and skills their offspring possess, voters wrote in
the entire list of components in their homemade systems. Other write-in
voters echoed the opinion of <i  >LJ</i> contributing editor
Greg Kroah-Hartman, who selected the Apple Power Mac G5, well supported
in Linux, as his
desktop of choice in this year's Editors' Choice Awards.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x267bd40"></a>Favorite Database</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>MySQL v4.0</p></li><li><p>PostgreSQL</p></li><li><p>Oracle 9i DB</p></li></ol></div><p>
This year's top three favorite databases were a repeat of last year's top
three. Although the Editors picked PostgreSQL as their favorite back in
August, readers selected MySQL over PostgreSQL by a 2 to 1 ratio.
Combined, MySQL and PostgreSQL own 78% of the votes. Add in Oracle 9i
and that percentage climbs to 83%. So what else are readers using for
their database work? SQLite, GemStone/S and Firebird picked up less than
a hundred votes apiece, and Versant was the most popular write-in
vote.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x267c0b0"></a>Favorite <i  >LJ</i> Column</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Cooking with Linux</p></li><li><p>Kernel Korner</p></li><li><p>Paranoid Penguin</p></li></ol></div><p>
Ah, Marcel. Like Susan Sarandon, David Bowie and '02 Bordeaux, Cooking
with Linux columnist Marcel Gagn&eacute;keeps getting better with age. Whether
he's showing us a new game, recommending a lovely Australian red or
demonstrating a little monitoring GUI, he's always supplying us with
useful information in fun ways.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x267c478"></a>Most Indispensable Linux Book</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux in a Nutshell, 3rd Edition</em></span>,
Ellen Siever, et al.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux, 4th Edition</em></span>, Matt
Welsh, et al.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Advanced UNIX Programming, 2nd
Edition</em></span>, Marc Rochkind</p></li></ol></div><p>
I was beginning to think I'd never see a new title in the top three
spots in the book category&mdash;just advancing edition numbers. But after five-plus years, we finally have a
new one. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Advanced UNIX Programming</em></span> by Marc J.
Rochkind landed in third place this year. Yes, it's a second edition
of a book originally published in 1985, but the content is mostly
new. The most popular write-in vote continued to be man pages.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x267c948"></a>Favorite Backup Utility</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>tar</p></li><li><p>Amanda</p></li><li><p>Arkeia Network Backup v5.2</p></li></ol></div><p>
For another year, tar was by far the most popular backup utility,
gathering votes from 65% of readers who responded. Amanda came in a
distant second, garnering 5% of all votes. On the write-in side, rsync
took the top spot. After that, it was a onesy-twosy game of Bacula,
personal shell scripts and proprietary offerings. This is weird,
though: no one said backups are for wimps.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x267ccb8"></a>Favorite Audio Tool</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>xmms</p></li><li><p>mplayer</p></li><li><p>Audacity</p></li></ol></div><p>
A bit of a shake-up in the audio category, as last year's number two and
number three tools&mdash;noatun and mpg123, respectively&mdash;were knocked out by
mplayer and Audacity. xmms remains the clear favorite, however, picking
up just fewer than 50% of the total votes. On the write-in side, KDE's amaroK
came in as the clear favorite, racking up enough votes to tie mpg123 for
sixth place overall.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x2a75278"></a>Favorite Desktop Environment</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>KDE</p></li><li><p>GNOME</p></li><li><p>Window Maker</p></li></ol></div><p>
For several years now, KDE and GNOME have finished first and second,
respectively, with an ever-increasing distance between the two. This
year, KDE received two votes for every one GNOME received. Window Maker
holds on to the number three spot, beating XFce by a single vote. No one
said &ldquo;they all suck&rdquo; this year, and the only write-in voter who
expressed frustration said he might try to write his own environment.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x2a75640"></a>Favorite Linux Web Site</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>LinuxFR</p></li><li><p>Slashdot</p></li><li><p>Freshmeat.net</p></li></ol></div><p>
Last year we noted how close voting was in this category, and this year,
for the first time ever, Slashdot isn't the favorite Web site. Granted,
only six votes separated LinuxFR from Slashdot, but has Slashdot lost
some of its cachet? Or is it simply because even hardware vendor news
sounds exciting in French?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x2a759b0"></a>Favorite Linux Training</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Linux Certified, Inc., Linux Systems &amp; Network
Administration Class</p></li><li><p>SuSE Linux Training</p></li><li><p>Tie: Novell Certified Linux Engineer and Linux Lunacy
Cruise</p></li></ol></div><p>
Judging by the numbers, most of our voters aren't into formal training,
preferring instead to use a combination of books, Web resources and, as
one voter put it, &ldquo;hard knocks&rdquo;. Among those going the more formal
route, Linux Certified, which offers classes in San Francisco and Boston,
was the favorite.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x2a75d78"></a>Favorite Distributed File Sharing System</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>BitTorrent</p></li><li><p>Gnutella</p></li><li><p>Red Hat Global Filesystem</p></li></ol></div><p> In its first year on our official nominee
list, BitTorrent claimed first place with no trouble
whatsoever, winning 62% of the votes. Last year's
favorite, Gnutella, fell hard to second place,
with just less than 11% of the total. eMule and eDonkey
grabbed most of the write-in votes, except for the
person who believes &ldquo;communism is wrong&rdquo;.
BitTorrent users can check out <a href="http://legaltorrents.com" target="_self">legaltorrents.com</a>
for many gigabytes of music, books and movies all
released under Creative Commons licenses.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x2a76198"></a>Favorite Programming Beverage</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Coffee</p></li><li><p>Water</p></li><li><p>Tea</p></li></ol></div><p>
Year after year, what people drink while programming
is one of the most hotly debated categories. Especially among the
write-in responses, our voters are loyal to their beverages beyond
belief. Caffeine in all its forms continues its reign, claiming around
85% of all votes. And who drinks Five Alive? I didn't even know they
made that anymore!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x2a76508"></a>Favorite Embedded Distribution</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Qtopia</p></li><li><p>MontaVista Linux</p></li><li><p>BlueCat</p></li></ol></div><p>
In its third year on the ballot, the embedded distribution category
continued to gain an increasing amount of total votes. Judging by the
write-ins, a lot of embedded Linux work is done using customized or
homemade variations. Among the commercial variants, the PDA environment
Qtopia remains the
favorite with a strong lead, almost twice the number of votes as the
second-place MontaVista. The Open Embedded Project also is attracting a
number of developers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x2a76878"></a>Favorite Web-Hosting Service</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>RackSpace Managed Hosting</p></li><li><p>Hurricane Electric Web Hosting</p></li><li><p>ServerBeach</p></li></ol></div><p>
With just less than 20% of all the votes, RackSpace is your favorite Web-hosting service again this year. But most of the votes in this category
continue to come in the form of write-ins, almost 64%. So what are you
using? OVH, Speakeasy, Amen (a French service) and DreamHost all
received several mentions. Overall, Web hosting remains a DIY
job among this voting crowd.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x2a76be8"></a>Favorite Development Tool</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)</p></li><li><p>Emacs</p></li><li><p>Eclipse</p></li></ol></div><p>
All these vendors are releasing development tools like crazy, but our
voters stick with the basics, thanks anyway. GCC and Emacs combine to
claim 33% of the total votes. After that, it's Eclipse and KDevelop.
Among write-ins, vi, vim and VisualWorks SmallTalk are the most popular.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x2a76f58"></a>Favorite Text Editor</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>vim</p></li><li><p>vi and vi clones</p></li><li><p>GNU Emacs</p></li></ol></div><p>
Last year, vim beat vi by almost three times as many votes; this year,
it was by only twice as many. Hmm, I wonder what that could mean?
Seriously, what's the voting process for if not a chance to
develop new conspiracy theories? Coming in at a strong number four
is Kate, the KDE Advanced Text Editor. Could readers finally be
ready for a modern user interface in an editor instead of
Meta-x this and Escape-colon-that? Stay tuned.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x2987bd8"></a>Favorite System Administration Tool</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Webmin</p></li><li><p>YaST</p></li><li><p>KDE Desktop Sharing</p></li></ol></div><p>
Be honest now, you all were most anxious about voting in this category,
weren't you? Nothing screams excitement like sysadmin tools. But we're
grateful to have them, that's for sure. Webmin collected barely more than 25%
of the total votes to take first place. On the write-in side, a
collection of text editors and shells claimed most of the votes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x2987f48"></a>Favorite Server</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>HP Integrity rx4640</p></li><li><p>HP ProLiant DL585</p></li><li><p>SGI Altix 3000</p></li></ol></div><p>
HP claimed first and second
place for a combined 35% of all votes in this category. Last year's
first-place finisher, the Altix 3000, fell to third this year. The
write-in votes featured a lot of Dell and IBM server variations. And, of
course, many of you continue to build your own servers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x29882b8"></a>Favorite Network or Server Appliance</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Cyclades AlterPath ACS</p></li><li><p>Net Integrator, vMark 1</p></li><li><p>Veritas Storage Foundation, v4.5</p></li></ol></div><p>
Only a few hundred voters expressed a preference in this category.
Among those who did vote, the Cyclades AlterPath ACS was the favorite for a second year.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x2988628"></a>Favorite Portable Workstation</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Monarch Hornet 64 Custom System</p></li><li><p>Linux Certified LC2430 Linux Laptop</p></li><li><p>EmperorLinux Toucan Laptop, vT42p</p></li></ol></div><p>
Laptops continue to dominate this category, although various Zaurus PDA
models made a number of appearances in the write-in section. The big
hardware vendors&mdash;Dell, IBM, Sony, Toshiba and Apple&mdash;ate up most of
the write-in votes. HP introduced its Linux laptop too late to catch
the voting, so we'll see how they do next time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x2988998"></a>Favorite Processor Architecture</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>AMD Athlon</p></li><li><p>Intel Pentium 2, 3 and 4</p></li><li><p>PowerPC</p></li></ol></div><p>
PowerPC and Opteron switched places this year, but only 20 votes separated
the two architectures. Meanwhile, Athlon held on to the top spot for
another year, having received 40% of the total vote count. Intel Itanium
picked up the most write-in votes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x2988d08"></a>Favorite Office Program</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>OpenOffice.org</p></li><li><p>AbiWord</p></li><li><p>StarOffice</p></li></ol></div><p>
Receiving 72% of the votes, OpenOffice.org is by far this year's favorite
office program. In fact, OpenOffice.org received 2,180 more votes than
the second-place finisher, AbiWord. It's hard to beat office software
that makes more logical sense than its competitors, is compatible with
almost everything and, oh yeah, is free.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x2989078"></a>Favorite Programming Language</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>C</p></li><li><p>Perl</p></li><li><p>C++</p></li></ol></div><p>
Ah, favorite programming language&mdash;time for a flame war. A bit of a
shake-up this year: after being knocked out of first place last year, C
reclaims it this year and C++ drops to third. The P language in the top
three is Perl, while PHP slips to fourth place, closely followed by
Python. The voting was close this year, too; only 59 votes separated
C from C++.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x29893e8"></a>Favorite Instant Messaging Client</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Gaim</p></li><li><p>Kopete</p></li><li><p>Jabber</p></li></ol></div><p>
Receiving almost 800 more votes than Kopete, Gaim is the clear winner of
the favorite instant-messaging client award. Kopete and Jabber switched
places since last year, but only seven votes separated them. Quite a few
voters wrote that they hate IM. Come on, guys, who has time these days to
wait for e-mail?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x2989758"></a>Favorite Graphics Program</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The GIMP</p></li><li><p>ImageMagick</p></li><li><p>gqview</p></li></ol></div><p>
It's okay if you want to skip this category; nothing really changes
here. The GIMP won almost 70% of the votes...again. Inkscape is the most
popular write-in vote this year. A number of you continue to use WINE to
access Photoshop and other non-Linux programs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x2989ac8"></a>Favorite Linux Game</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Frozen Bubble</em></span></p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Tux Racer</em></span></p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake 3</em></span></p></li></ol></div><p>
We find it quite interesting that every year one of the categories that
receives the most votes is Favorite Linux Game. According to some, games
on Linux pale in comparison to what's available for other platforms. But
that doesn't stop our voters from wasting hours at the keyboard, does
it? <span   class="emphasis"><em>Frozen Bubble</em></span> retains its addictive powers for
another year and claims first prize.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2583580.0x2c049a8"></a>Favorite Web Browser</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Mozilla</p></li><li><p>Konqueror</p></li><li><p>Opera</p></li></ol></div><p>
The top two spots are the same this year as they were last year, with
Mozilla claiming 50% of all votes. Opera broke the top three this year,
sending Galeon down to fifth place. On the write-in side, it's all about
the Firefox. To those of you complaining that Firefox is not Mozilla or
another Gecko-based browser, your pleas have been duly noted.
