Linux developers are usually interesting people. So are graphic artists,
musicians and sound engineers. So when a successful musician combines all
of
these traits, we simply have to interview him.

<span   class="bold"><b>FM:</b></span> Australis, who are you?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Australis:</b></span> I am Oscar Aguayo, a music composer and producer. Australis is, of
course, the name under which I release my music. I've released three physical
albums since 2005, along with one free digital compilation. I am currently
completing the material for a fourth album that I hope to release later this year.

<span   class="bold"><b>FM:</b></span>
You are a successful indie musician. Do you have a day job?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>A:</b></span> Yes, I do have a day job. I'm a
software engineer at a well-established local company in Salt Lake
City, Utah.
</p><p>
However, we indie artists define &ldquo;success&rdquo; differently from what the music
industry has got the world used to for a few centuries. As independents,
we have absolute freedom to define what &ldquo;success&rdquo; means to each one of us.
</p><p>
To me, success is when my music is listened to and enjoyed around the
globe, or when listeners from as far away as Singapore or The Netherlands ask
me for the release date of my next material, or when I am approached by
serious contributors to serious publications, like you.
</p><p>
The money that comes from my music is nice&mdash;I can't deny it. But it is
not part of what I consider my personal definition of &ldquo;artistic
success&rdquo;.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>FM:</b></span>
How did you discover Linux?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>A:</b></span> Some years ago, I was working as a head
of software development. I
discovered that several of the paid Windows tools we needed to develop
and test our product existed as comparable and fully functional open-source
projects on Linux. That was my turning point.
</p><p>
I started with an Ubuntu Live CD to try things out without repercussions
to the existing Windows installation we used, and it almost felt like I
had been lied to all my life. As I explored office suites, development
environments, tools and utilities, I kept asking myself why I hadn't
explored this universe of openness and power before!
</p><p>
After a few months (mostly spent convincing the directors), the company's
software development department had migrated to a pure Linux environment.
</p><p>
For me, the conversion also was complete. I still find myself forced to
use Windows in one specific context, but for all others, I use only Linux.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>FM:</b></span>
Your music is, schematically, melodic instrumental synths. It has been
compared to Jean-Michel Jarre and recent Tangerine Dream. Do you agree?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>A:</b></span> Yes, but it is a relative
&ldquo;yes&rdquo;. Jean-Michel Jarre and Tangerine
Dream are, among others, some of the first exponents of electronic new
age music. I was a very young teenager when they were the only source of
music in this genre. Their influence on what would become my personal
composing style is something I have to admit. Vangelis and Enigma are
other particularly strong sources of influence in my music.
</p><p>
As a composer though, I discovered that without a conscious effort,
every composer ends up &ldquo;boxed&rdquo; in his own style, repeating himself again
and again, creating music that is only a copy of what he has already
created before. For that reason, I always get away from my comfort zone
in order to explore other genres and styles and offer a fresh and varied
mixture of musical landscapes to listeners.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>FM:</b></span>
Do you use Linux for the composition?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>A:</b></span> This is the one context in which I am forced to use Windows instead
of Linux. Unfortunately, and I say this with real regret, the number
of synths and virtual libraries for music production available on Linux
is still seriously behind compared to what's available on Windows.
</p><p>
There are some very serious pieces of software for music production out
there, don't get me wrong. But you have to see it from the composer's
point of view. Inspiration comes to you at any moment, and when it does,
you have to record what it's telling you by whatever means you have at
hand at that moment.
</p><p>
A piano is ideal if you are at home. A digital recorder works too if
you are away from an instrument. If nothing else, a notepad or even a
napkin can work too. But later, when you are ready to build your new
music piece from that initial annotation, would you do it with only a
fraction of the orchestra present?
</p><p>
That's the dilemma when trying to compose in Linux. You have very nice
instruments available, but not all. And, since you are composing&mdash;in
other words, you don't know beforehand what sounds you'll want to use
to assemble your piece&mdash;you need all sounds available, all libraries
and instruments on standby in case you need to use or tweak them.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>FM:</b></span>
You do use Linux to master the MP3s and other files you sell or
distribute, in order to guarantee they are not propagating viruses. Is
the public sensitive to the security argument?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>A:</b></span> I do use Linux when mastering my material, yes. And one of the many
strong reasons I do is because of how secure and clean Linux is regarding
viruses and malware, compared to Windows. I know the public is very
sensitive to the security of their computers and networks, especially
now that phishing, malware and identity theft are so widespread.
</p><p>
Personally, I have not heard concerns about how secure the digital
versions of my music are. That is a main concern of mine, however, and
knowing that the systems I use to produce, master and deliver my music
to the world are 100% secure and clean is a very important step in the
whole process.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>FM:</b></span>
You are using Linux for composing CGI images. Can you tell us about
your graphic artist side? Which tools are you using?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>A:</b></span> I've always been interested in graphic
composition, including 3-D
modeling and rendering. In fact, I used to do commercial 3-D animations in
the previous century. I had to relegate all of this to an
&ldquo;as-needed&rdquo;
level when I decided to concentrate on music composition and production
back in 1999 even before Australis.
</p><p>
Fortunately, indie artists have more possibilities of participating
in other aspects of their music. Fortunately, I had the opportunity
to create the covers for all my albums, the graphics for Australis'
Web site and its profile on Facebook. Obviously, there have been other
people behind most of those graphic compositions, like photographers
and graphic designers providing their talent here and there. But for
the most part, I've been lucky to be able to be directly involved in the
graphic side of Australis too.
</p><p>
When dealing with photography&mdash;like for the cover of my album
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Gates of Reality</em></span>&mdash;I use GIMP almost exclusively, complementing with
Inkscape for typography and vectors. When creating abstract compositions,
I use other tools. For example, for the cover of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sentient
Genus</em></span>, I used
a Linux port of the fractal app <span   class="emphasis"><em>Apophysis</em></span> that allows you to manipulate
all parameters directly to create incredibly complex images. Lately, I've
been exploring a 3-D fractal creation tool for Linux called Mandelbulber.

</p></div></div><p>
Whatever tools I use to create the main graphic components though,
I always finish the final images on GIMP.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>FM:</b></span>
From your very first release (<span   class="emphasis"><em>Lifegiving</em></span>, 2005), you were noted
for your polished sound and high-level production. You were clearly not
a beginner when you released the first Australis album.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>A:</b></span> Well, I've always been the composer for the bands I have played with,
but in 1999, I had the wonderful opportunity of also being the producer for
an independent rock/pop band called Cabala (pronounced with an accent
in the first a, like cAbala). You should have heard the first material
I produced! It was so deficient, lacking and even disproportionate in
how every element participated in the mixes. You may know how to use the
tools for the production of audio, but until you have educated your ears,
you can't produce clean and high-quality music!
</p><p>
The band dissolved in 2004 (which is what pushed me to create Australis
as a solo project that same year), but by then I had a better trained
auditive perception, which fortunately has helped me with Australis'
sound.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>FM:</b></span>
Do you find uses for Linux in sound engineering?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>A:</b></span> Part of the pleasure of becoming a Linux user is to migrate as many
of your normal tasks to Linux as possible. As I mentioned earlier,
most of the composition of my music has to be done in Windows. But as
soon as I am done with the creation part of the process, I switch to
Linux to do sound processes like mixing, normalization and mastering,
using Audacity's many professional-level features.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11537f6.large.jpg"><img src="11537f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
As a side comment, I wish more companies and/or developers would engage in
producing serious virtual music instruments and libraries for Linux. The
platform is more stable and reliable than the rest out there. And I am
sure I am not the only composer who would make a complete migration if
there were enough tools for music creation on Linux.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>FM:</b></span>
Do you rent time in a professional studio, or do you have an in-house
studio?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>A:</b></span> I have had an in-house studio for several years. When playing with
Cabala, we rented a professional studio at the beginning, and although
the results were very satisfactory, the expense left us broke for a
couple months. That's how I became their producer and sound
engineer&mdash;we couldn't afford that expense again for a long time.
</p><p>
When I created Australis, I was in a better position to modify a room
at home in order to get a clean input when recording acoustic instruments.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>FM:</b></span>
What instruments do you play? Do you hire musicians for recordings?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>A:</b></span> With a few exceptions, I play all the instruments you can hear in
my music&mdash;piano, synthesizers, guitar, drums, percussion. Even some
vocals throughout my albums are my real voice. When I need something I
can't do by myself though, I bring in other musicians to
participate&mdash;every
time I need a female voice, for example, or whenever I am creating
an ethnic piece that requires very specialized performances with less
traditional instruments.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>FM:</b></span>
Do you carry over your software development habits when you
work on music? Or does the musician side prefer improvisation and
inspiration-driven, spur-of-the-moment setups?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>A:</b></span> No, I am a structured being. I need everything organized in a
meaningful manner to be able to function musically&mdash;or to function
in general. I've come up with my own ways to organize files, backups,
documentation and so on&mdash;nothing weird or cryptic, just my own way to place
things where I know I'll search for them later.
</p><p>
This is an enormous advantage when the &ldquo;musician side&rdquo; kicks in and
wants to improvise and follow the inspiration of the moment. I know
where to go to load the sounds I want at that moment, and I keep adding
tracks to the improvisation as inspiration keeps flowing. You really
appreciate being organized when you are in a hurry trying to register
the inspiration suddenly striking you. Being able to load a specific
percussion set within 30 seconds of arriving to the studio, for example,
versus spending ten minutes browsing through libraries in search of
some useful percussive sounds, may actually be the difference between
registering your musical idea or losing it.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>FM:</b></span>
What was your first computer? Do you remember your first program?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>A:</b></span> I do remember my first program, and it was in BASIC!
</p><p>
My first computer was a Tandy TRS-80. It was the early 1980s, so not
many young people may be familiar with that computer. It was the time
when personal computers were still very expensive, and a new line of
hobby computers (like the Commodore 64, and others) came about. It was
basically a keyboard attached to a small CPU that connected to your TV.
</p><p>
I was a young teenager then, and living in Peru, I knew no English
whatsoever. The youth-oriented BASIC book that came with the computer was,
of course, in English. But the attraction was too strong, and with the
help of a dictionary and equivalent amounts of frustration and curiosity,
I started to understand the underlying concepts and finally make sense
of the new universe opening in front of me.
</p><p>
My very first BASIC program was a simple implementation of the
&ldquo;hangman&rdquo;
game.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>FM:</b></span>
Let's go back to your software engineering side. Your Web site says:
&ldquo;I believe there's an important difference between
'engineering'
software and merely 'programming' it. I believe in engineering. I
also believe in sound logic. I believe in clean code. I believe in
documentation. I believe in coding with the future in mind....I believe
in creating solid components for the software I develop.&rdquo;
That's a strong philosophical statement about how you view your work. Do
you think that using Linux helps you adhere to this philosophy?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>A:</b></span> Definitely. I was a software developer way before I became a Linux
user. Windows was all I knew at that time, and like people who have not
had the opportunity to travel to other cultures and see other societies
and idiosyncrasies, I ended up thinking this small circle was all there
is. I developed programs with Microsoft tools, using Microsoft languages,
deployed on Microsoft platforms. However good of a developer you are, your
ignorance about what else is there in the world is a strong limitation.
</p><p>
Beyond developing, engineering is the ability to see the whole of
a system, not just its parts. If you don't have a clear view of the
whole picture (which includes other platforms, issues like portability,
compilation and so on), how can you be an engineer?
</p><p>
Moving to Linux from Windows first and Mac later gives you a wider
understanding of these issues, allowing you to code better, thinking
ahead for possibilities like migration, compatibility, maintenance and so
on.
</p><p>
Another big help comes from the development infrastructure available
on Linux. Not only does it have nothing to envy Microsoft's or Apple's,
but also I honestly feel it is much better. The open-source philosophies
have reached maturity and have favored such an amount of environments
and tools and resources&mdash;most of them naturally oriented towards
open-source platforms like Linux&mdash;that I would seriously recommend to any
developer or software engineer to use Linux from the start.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>FM:</b></span>
Some musicians complain that the Internet makes it too easy to
pirate music. You don't use DRM in your releases. That's a hot topic
among OSS supporters. What's your opinion?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>A:</b></span> This is a touchy subject in the music industry, and every publishing
musician I know has an opinion, one way or another.
</p><p>
My own opinion is that, yes, the Internet makes it very easy to pirate
a musician's work. However, it is also my opinion that piracy always
has existed. Remember when you would insert a blank cassette into your tape
recorder and wait for hours until your favorite station played the song
you wanted to record? According to the modern definition of music piracy,
we were pirates when doing this in the 1980s.
</p><p>
Why is it that nobody cared about piracy back then? Why is it such a hot
topic now? Imagine musicians lobbying for the suppression of sales of
blank cassettes. Ridiculous, isn't it? What is different now though? I
believe the answer is money.
</p><p>
The Internet allows the acquisition of music, for free, at a much,
much larger scale. And then the record labels started to lose money
(the musicians too, but at a much smaller scale; the big money from
music goes to record labels). Is this bad? I honestly don't know.
</p><p>
I can't go into the philosophical principles at play here, but I think
there is something fundamentally wrong with the model the music industry
has been following since the last century. Piracy is a problem, yes,
but I think it is more a problem for the record label than for the
musician. Record labels keep 90% of music sales while the artist receives
10% or less.
</p><p>
On one hand, this is understandable because a record label has
professionals and facilities and channels to make the artist's music
reach the audience, and that has a cost. But on the other hand, doesn't it
ring wrong when 90% of what you are paying for a CD is non-artist-related
overhead?
</p><p>
So, yes, the Internet has allowed the piracy that has existed for decades
to grow much wider. But is it wrong? Or is this a sign that the music
industry's model is obsolete? I don't know. Maybe record labels need
to make themselves leaner now that the Internet is doing most of the
distribution work for them? Maybe we artists need to find a way to give
more to listeners if they buy the CD than if they download the music
for free?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>FM:</b></span>
Your work is independently released. Any misgivings about big labels?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>A:</b></span> Yeah. Distrust. Without any disrespect intended, a record label is
nothing more than a company with the sole purpose of making money. Their
purpose is not to mentor aspiring artists or to provide them with
useful artistic services. And certainly, their purpose is not to
&ldquo;help&rdquo;
any artist, but themselves. I know it sounds bitter, but consider it
at the same level as a bank or an insurance company. They care about
their customers as long as they produce profit for the company. The
moment customers become expenses, the company loses all interest in
them. Although cold, this is just the way any commercial company works.
</p><p>
We artists, however, tend to &ldquo;romanticize&rdquo; record labels as some sort of
benefactor that will recognize our true artistic potential and will then,
out of love for art&mdash;&ldquo;the world needs to hear your
talent&rdquo; kind of thing&mdash;will take our hand and guide us through the maze-like path to stardom.
</p><p>
The truth is that record labels are looking only for an investment. And
they expect a return on that investment. After all, as any commercial
organization, they need to pay salaries, expenses and so on and hopefully
make a profit while at it. So, when searching for a potential new artist,
their first criteria has to be &ldquo;will this new artist make us
money?&rdquo;
</p><p>
I went through the process of sending demos to dozens of record labels
when playing with Cabala, feeling confused when only a few responded
with a &ldquo;got your demo&rdquo; e-mail, and a couple &ldquo;we'll give it a listen
and will let you know&rdquo;. The band had a decent following, and its sound
was better than what was on the radio at the time.
</p><p>
In time I realized that, like our band, thousands of other bands were
constantly sending demos to record labels. They have literally piles of
submissions waiting to be heard by their scouts. If a demo&mdash;typically
two or three songs long&mdash;requires 15 to 20 minutes to be heard and
analyzed, imagine how long it would take to go through hundreds of them
every week!
</p><p>
So, unless you are lucky and are &ldquo;found&rdquo; by a label, that approach
resembles a lottery more than a professional step. I learned this as
Cabala was starting to dissolve and went to create Australis with the
intention of releasing my music independently.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>FM:</b></span>
Any advice for young aspiring musicians?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>A:</b></span> Yeah. Take your dream by the steering wheel and drive it
yourself. Don't invest your time and energy trying to find someone
to drive it for you. It is your dream. Nobody understands it like
you do. Just perfect your skills and prepare to do everything by
yourself. Your chances to succeed will be much, much better that way
than trying to be chosen by labels that are drowning in the noise made
by hundreds of others like you.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>FM:</b></span>
Any advice for young aspiring software engineers?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>A:</b></span> Hmmm, I would say to remain a learner forever. There are no plateaus in
engineering, and if you feel you've reached one, it should be a warning
that you are falling behind compared to the rest of the world. However
creative and innovative you are, there's always someone better. Keeping
a learning attitude will always push you to be better.
