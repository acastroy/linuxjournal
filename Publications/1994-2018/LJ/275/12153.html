<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #275, March 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Filesystem capabilities are supposed to be an improvement over simply
running something as the root user. The idea is that you identify the
specific special powers a program needs and then give it the ability
to do only those special powers. Unfortunately, capabilities have
become very complicated, with some individual capabilities being used
to grant so many special powers that they might as well just be the
root user after all.
</p><p>
In particular, kernel developers who create new powers don't always
know of which capability that power should be a part, so any given
capability can end up providing either too much or too little power to
the program.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Michael Kerrisk</b></span> recently began an effort to document some basic
guidelines to help developers figure out which capability would best
house any particular new power. For example, &ldquo;Don't choose
CAP_SYS_ADMIN if you can possibly avoid it!&rdquo; Apparently
<span   class="bold"><b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b></span> has become a huge dumping ground for powers of all
sorts, falling prey to the might-as-well-be-root syndrome.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, <span   class="bold"><b>Casey Schaufler</b></span> pointed out
some <span   class="bold"><b>POSIX</b></span> history that led
to poor decisions being made early on, regarding how to organize
filesystem capabilities. For example:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Everyone involved was looking to use capabilities to meet B2 least
privilege requirements in NSA security evaluations. Because those
evaluations were of security policy, by far the easiest thing to do
was to create a single capability for all the things that didn't show
up in the security policy and declare that the people doing the
evaluation didn't have to look over there.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Ultimately, my guess is that filesystem capabilities will have to be
replaced by some kind of non-POSIX solution that's better thought out,
but what that might look like remains an open question.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>fbdev</b></span> drivers have been on the chopping block for quite a while
now, as the <span   class="bold"><b>DRM</b></span> framework has been trying to replace them for years.
But whenever anyone tries to get rid of those last straggling fbdev
drivers, <span   class="bold"><b>Geert Uytterhoeven</b></span> or someone else always asks the same
question: &ldquo;Can DRM be used to create extremely simple display
drivers?&rdquo;
And, the answer is always &ldquo;Yes, absolutely! Not right now, but
soon!&rdquo;
At which point Geert or someone else vetoes the expurgation, and the
process begins again some months later.
</p><p>
But, this time it turned out, as <span   class="bold"><b>Daniel
Vetter</b></span> noted, DRM has
indeed advanced to the point of being able to produce those simple
drivers right now. The community had heard the objections, and the
community had answered. It took a little time, this time, for this to
be made clear. Partly this was because Geert had gone through the
rejection ritual so many times in the past that it had become an
ingrained habit.
</p><p>
But once the truth finally became clear, Geert withdrew his
objections, and now it looks as though the last few remaining fbdev
drivers soon will be history&mdash;or at least, the remaining obstacles are
no longer absolute deal-breakers.
</p><p>
This has been a long time coming, and the DRM folks have had to endure
a lot of frustration in the process, so there was much ringing of
bells when the path was cleared at last.
</p><p>
One thing that's no fun is when the <span   class="bold"><b>CPU</b></span> itself contains security
holes. It's a real pain to discover that certain opcodes leak crucial
information, because it essentially means that those opcodes 
never should be used. They're just wasted transistors, taking up space on the
chip.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Paolo Bonzini</b></span> recently wanted to disable several CPU instructions for
<span   class="bold"><b>KVM</b></span>, such as the <span   class="bold"><b>SGDT</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>SIDT</b></span> opcodes, which he said could leak
kernel addresses into userspace. Once leaked, those addresses could be
used to defeat certain security measures, such as address layout
randomization.
</p><p>
So, that's happening. Meanwhile, folks like <span   class="bold"><b>Liang Z
Li</b></span> have offered to
help lock down those issues.
</p><p>
Everyone wants to support <span   class="bold"><b>USB type C</b></span>, the new USB connector that works
right side up and upside down. And, <span   class="bold"><b>Heikki
Krogerus</b></span> of <span   class="bold"><b>Intel</b></span> recently
posted some patches to support this. There was quite a bit of
discussion and review of the patch, and enough problems arose that
<span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span> took a deeper look at the code. The patch turned out to have
so many deep structural problems, Greg insisted that Heikki take
the code back to Intel and have the engineers there give it a thorough
going-over before Greg even would agree to look at it again.
</p><p>
So, that was harsh. Nobody likes to hear that their code is so bad that
the upstream maintainer won't even look at future versions unless the
downstream maintainers stage some sort of intervention. But, that's
what happened.
</p><p>
Ultimately, USB type C support will be coming sooner rather than
later. There's a lot of motivation to support it, given its popularity
in the real world. I would imagine that the Intel engineers already
are much closer to a proper patch.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: My World, in a Lock Screen</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #275, March 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
It feels weird to mention a Microsoft product in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>. But to
be honest, there are some cool things coming out of the Microsoft Garage
(<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/garage" target="_self">www.microsoft.com/garage</a>). One of those things is
&ldquo;Next Lock Screen&rdquo;,
which is an Android app that brings interactive tools to the lock screen.
</p><p>
This concept isn't revolutionary, but with Next Lock Screen, it's done
very well. It's possible to launch apps, interact with messages and
get customized notifications all without unlocking your phone. Do you
prefer to have your calendar events on your lock screen? Done. Want to
control your music? Done. Again, nothing here is really new, it's just
integrated and customizable in a way that takes a bunch of good ideas
and repackages them into a slick lock screen. You also can get the Bing
wallpaper on your lock screen, which is pretty cool, because honestly,
the Bing photo of the day is almost always incredible.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12153androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="12153androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
If you're not afraid to try an app developed by Microsoft, I urge you to
check out Next Lock Screen. It makes a locked phone far more useful! (I
should add that enabling interaction on your lock screen does make it
far less secure, so be careful as to which features you enable.) Check it out
at the Google Play Store.

<h2 class="title">Read a Book in the Blink of an Eye!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #275, March 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I love reading. Sadly, the 24 hours I get per day seems to be inadequate
for the tasks I need to accomplish. That might change as my teenagers
turn into college kids and then begin to start families of their own. For
now, however, between drama class and basketball practice, it seems like
it takes about 30 hours to accomplish a 24-hour day. Needless to say,
I don't read as many books as I'd like.
</p><p>
Normally I take advantage of commute time to listen to audiobooks. That
actually works quite well, and I'm able to read 30&ndash;40 books a year. Most
of those books are fiction, but still, I'm grateful for audiobooks. Not
long ago, I discovered a different sort of audiobook. I honestly have
mixed feelings about the concept, but imagine if Cliff Notes and Audiobooks
had a baby. That baby might be called &ldquo;Blinkist&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Blinkist is a company that condenses books into very short
summaries. They are available via text (for Kindle and the like), but
for me, the professionally narrated audio versions are really what work
best. Rather than reading an audiobook over the course of a week, I can
&ldquo;read&rdquo; a book on the way to the grocery store. I'm shocked to admit,
the summaries of entire books are surprisingly useful. For many books,
the summary from Blinkist is enough. For some, the &ldquo;blinks&rdquo; make me want
to read the entire book. That means although it's not a 100% replacement
for reading, it adds value (and knowledge) to my life.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12153blinkf1.large.jpg"><img src="12153blinkf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
There is a three-day free trial that allows you to read as many books as
you like. I urge you to give it a try. After the three days, you can
either default to the free account, which allows you to listen (or
read) one pre-chosen free book a day, or opt for a paid subscription.
For text-only &ldquo;blinks&rdquo;, it's $50/year. For unlimited text and audio
&ldquo;blinks&rdquo;, it's $80/year. Thankfully, three days is a enough time to figure
out if it's something you find worth buying.
</p><p>
Thanks to its cool way of fitting more information into our over-busy
lives and its handy mobile app for &ldquo;blinking&rdquo; on the go, Blinkist
gets the Editors' Choice award this month. If nothing else, check out
the free trial at <a href="http://www.blinkist.com" target="_self">www.blinkist.com</a>. You can read a surprising number of books in three free
days!

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: File Spelunking with WinDirStat</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #275, March 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
With Linux, it's fairy easy to find the large files on your system by doing
something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
du -ahx / | sort -rh | head -20
</pre>
</p><p>
Unfortunately, Windows users don't usually have equivalent tools. That's
where something like WinDirStat comes into play. It's a file browser that
uses incredible GUI elements to show you the files on your system with
file size shown as rectangles. Big files are shown as big rectangles, and
their file types are specified by color. It's a great visual way to sort
your filesystem and get rid of (or at least find) extremely large files.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12153fossf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
(Image via <a href="https://windirstat.net" target="_self">https://windirstat.net</a>)
</p></div></div><p>
If you use Windows on a regular basis, but seem to have a shrinking hard
drive, I urge you to download WinDirStat to get real-time statistics
on your filesystem. It's open source and, of course, free to download
at <a href="https://windirstat.net" target="_self">https://windirstat.net</a>.

<h2 class="title">Jmol: Viewing Molecules with Java</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #275, March 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Let's dig back into some chemistry software to see what kind
of work you can do on your Linux machine. Specifically, let's look at
Jmol, a Java application that is available as both a desktop application
and a web-based applet (<a href="http://jmol.sourceforge.net" target="_self">jmol.sourceforge.net</a>). 
</p><p>
You can use Jmol to help analyze
the results you get from other software packages that actually
calculate the chemical effects you are researching. It can read in
dozens of different file formats, and you can use it to visualize everything
from small molecules to huge macromolecules, like proteins. You 
also can visualize crystals and orbitals. You even can visualize animated
events, such as chemical reactions and molecular vibrations. 
</p><p>
Most
Linux distributions should have Jmol available within their package
management repositories. For example, you can install it on Debian-based
distributions with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install jmol
</pre>
</p><p>
If you want to use the latest and greatest version, download it
from the main project website. The download comes as a simple zip file
containing everything you need to run Jmol. You also will need to install a Java
virtual machine in order to run Jmol. 
</p><p>
If you installed
Jmol from the package manager, you probably will have a script available
that will make running Jmol easier. If you install it from the binary zip
file, you will need to run it manually by calling Java and using the
JAR file as a command-line option.
</p><p>
When you first start Jmol, you'll see a blank screen, ready for
input. Across the top is a series of icons allowing for
easy access to the key functions available within Jmol. If you already
have data files to analyze, you can use them. Otherwise, you may need
some sample files in order to play with the functionality available. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12153jmolf1.large.jpg"><img src="12153jmolf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. When you first start Jmol, you get a blank workspace ready for
your work.
</p></div></div><p>
The
binary distribution doesn't include any sample files in order to save on download
bandwidth; however, several sample data files are available from the main
website. You can get the entire set by downloading a snapshot
of the source files. In the examples for the rest of this article, I'm 
using several of the sample data files available from the source
snapshot download. 
</p><p>
The simplest example is just to load a data file and
see what it looks like. Figure 2 shows what you get when you load the
sample file Jmol-datafiles/gaussian/phenylnitrine.g94.out.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12153jmolf2.large.jpg"><img src="12153jmolf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The basic display you get when you load a molecule is a ball and
stick display.
</p></div></div><p>
The data display is an interactive one. Using your mouse, you
can click and drag the molecule to rotate it around to see all of the
details. 
</p><p>
The Display menu item provides a number of options to play
with the molecule. The Atom menu item allows you to change how much
of the van der Waals force field to show. The Bond menu item shows
how thick to make the bonds between atoms. With these two options,
you can tailor the display so that the appropriate amount of detail is
shown. The Label menu item allows you to add either symbols, names or
atomic numbers to the atoms within the molecule. 
</p><p>
Near the bottom of the
Display menu, there is a check box for whether hydrogen atoms
are displayed within the display of the molecule. 
</p><p>
While I'm talking
about how to affect the display of the molecule, I should mention that the View menu item
provides a number of presets on how to line up the molecule. So, with
a single click, you can view the molecule along any of its axes. 
</p><p>
Jmol
also can display animations of events, along with static images. The
animations subdirectory contains several examples that you can play
with. When you load it up, you start with a static image of the molecule
as before. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12153jmolf3.large.jpg"><img src="12153jmolf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. When you load an animation, it starts with a static image of your
molecule.
</p></div></div><p>
Within the icon bar at the top of the window, there
are a series of buttons at the far right-hand side that allow you to
step through the frames of the animation frame by frame. If you want
to see the full animation, there's set of options under the 
Tools&rarr;Animate menu item. Here, you can go through the animation once, or
you can put it on a loop. 
</p><p>
You can even use a mode called Palindrome
that goes forward through the animation and then backward. That way,
you need to calculate only one half of the motion, yet you still are able to
visualize the entire range of the motion.
</p><p>
Several more analysis tools are available. Clicking the
Tools&rarr;Spectra&rarr;JSpecView menu item pops up a new window. Under
the File menu item, you'll find options to add extra files, or do H1
or C13 simulations. You can select Tools&rarr;Measurements to
measure the distance between atoms within your molecule, and you can set the units used
for those measurements with the Tools&rarr;Distance
Units menu item. You actually can edit the molecule after it is loaded too. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12153jmolf4.large.jpg"><img src="12153jmolf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. JSpecView is an extra tool available for looking at the spectra of
molecules.
</p></div></div><p>
If you
click the icon button with the hover-over description &ldquo;Open the model
kit&rdquo;, you'll get a small set of drop-down items on the top left side of
the display window. It allows you to delete atoms, move bonds
around or even change the atom species at specific locations. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12153jmolf5.large.jpg"><img src="12153jmolf5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Jmol also lets you edit molecules.
</p></div></div><p>
If you
have some type of analysis that you need to repeat several times, Jmol
supports the addition of macros. Macros are just simple text files that
contain a set of Jmol instructions. If you save them in the 
~/.jmol/macros directory, Jmol will pick them up and provide them within the
Macros menu item. 
</p><p>
The language for the macros is the same used for
Jmol's scripting capabilities. This scripting language is based on
of RasMol, with some minor changes. There is a full language reference
available at <a href="http://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/docs" target="_self">chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/docs</a>. 
</p><p>
You also can use scripts interactively by clicking
the File&rarr;Script Editor menu item. This pops up a new
window where you can write your script, check its syntax and then run
it within Jmol. This provides a huge amount of power, allowing you to get
the exact type of analysis you need.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12153jmolf6.large.jpg"><img src="12153jmolf6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Jmol provides a full scripting language to help automate your
analysis steps.
</p></div></div><p>
Once you've done your analysis, several output options
are available. The File&rarr;Export menu item gives you four options. You
can select Export Image to save a static image in one of several
image file formats. 
</p><p>
Because Jmol also operates as a Java applet, you can
select Export to Web Page to generate a web page that you 
then can use within your own website to share your research results. 
</p><p>
If
you want a higher-resolution image of a molecule, you can select
Render in POV-Ray to use the POV-Ray external program to render
a high quality 3D image. 
</p><p>
The last export option is Write State,
which saves the current workspace so that you can reload it later and
continue your analysis. There also is an extra output option under
Tools&rarr;Gaussian that pops up another window. 
Here you can set several options for a Gaussian input file that you can
then use to run further simulations of your molecule. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12153jmolf7.large.jpg"><img src="12153jmolf7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. You can use Jmol to generate Gaussian input files based on your
analysis.
</p></div></div><p>
With these tools,
you easily can share your research results with others and build on the
work you are doing.

<h2 class="title">Is the Best Tea Ever Really Worth It?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #275, March 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I recently wrote about my &ldquo;perfect tea&rdquo;-steeping device. It's nothing
more than a plastic mug-shaped device that has a sieve built in for
straining tea leaves after the steeping process is complete. I use it
every day. Really. And compared to the tech pieces I normally write in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, that little UpFront blurb garnered me quite a few emails
asking for details. It also got me a few messages explaining that brewing
tea in a plastic cup was an unforgivable sin. One email, however, did
make me think. I was asked about my Breville One Touch Tea Maker.
</p><p>
For Christmas (or a birthday?) a few years back, my incredible wife bought
me a $250 tea maker. The One Touch treats making tea a bit like making
coffee. You put the tea leaves into a basket, and the brewing process
is automatic. The cool part is that it makes the water the perfect
temperature and steeps the leaves for the exact right time depending
on the type of tea you're making. And you know what? It makes the best
tea I've ever had. Seriously. It makes tea noticeably better than any
other method I've used. And yet, I rarely use it. Why?
</p><p>
It turns out that although the One Touch isn't exactly difficult to clean,
it does take some effort. That's frustrating. The real gotcha, however,
is that I don't drink the entire pot of tea quickly enough, and even though
the One Touch keeps tea hot for an hour, I find myself heating cold
tea in the microwave. It is possible to make a smaller batch of tea,
but if you're going to go through the hassle of brewing a pot of tea,
why wouldn't you make a full pot? So most of the time I use my One Touch
pot to heat water, and then brew tea in the plastic steeper. It's crazy.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12153onef1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
My Breville One Touch has been instrumental in my thinking when it
comes to tech purchases, and I wish I'd learned its lesson sooner. My
PlayStation 4 Pro? I actually find the PS3 is just as fun and a fraction
of the price. My rackmount Xeon ESXi server? The few Raspberry Pi servers
I have are actually more useful and flexible. Heck, even my fancy new
F-150 pickup isn't half as fun as my 43-year-old Volkswagen Beetle. 
</p><p>
So
what did my $250 tea maker teach me? Marketing and popularity aren't
what make things great. It's a lesson I should have learned years ago,
because Linux is free, and yet it's the operating system that brings me
the most joy!
