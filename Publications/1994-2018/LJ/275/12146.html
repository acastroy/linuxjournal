Stop</h4><p>
Regarding Doc Searls' &ldquo;Debugging Democracy&rdquo; in the January
2017 issue: please stop printing childish personal insults in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>. When
you refer to the President-Elect as &ldquo;Internet troll Donald
Trump&rdquo;,
you are being personally insulting, childish by playing funny games
with someone's name (&ldquo;heh heh, he's got 'rump' in his name!&rdquo;), and
promoting politics of hate and fear. This has no place in a technical
journal and no relevance to Linux or computing in general.
</p><p>
You would not refer to the losing candidate as a &ldquo;shrew&rdquo;, nor would
you play childish games with her name as a way of insulting her. In
fact, you did refer to her, by her correct name, without personal
insult.
</p><p>
I'm sorry, but the election process does not need &ldquo;debugging&rdquo; because
your favorite lost. This has happened every four years since the
ratification of the US Constitution&mdash;someone wins, someone loses.
It's a direct and inevitable side effect of having one President
instead of two. Every time, nearly half the voters are disappointed.
</p><p>
By picking sides and using personal insults to make political
commentary after the election is over and done, you disappoint
upwards of half of your subscribers. Doc Searls owes an apology to the
readers, if not to Mr Trump himself.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Mark
 Kramer  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc Searls replies:</b></span> Mark is right. I do owe readers an apology. By
calling Donald Trump a troll (take a look at the Wikipedia definition of
internet troll at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll</a> and draw your
own conclusions), I was being a troll as well. Even though
trolling wasn't my intent, that has been the effect so far: every
response to my January column, both here and on our website, has been as
negative as Mark's, and for the same reasons.
</p><p>
Opening with that remark also failed to support the main purpose of that
column, which was to call for help in rescuing journalism&mdash;and real
journals such as this one&mdash;from drowning in a sea of
&ldquo;content&rdquo;,
way too much of which is crap routed by algorithms aimed by
surveillance-gathered data into echo chambers of the like-minded. This has
the effect of increasing enmity and blame toward those in echo chambers
with opposing sympathies, which is worse than dangerous in democratic
societies, because it tears apart the center spaces of basic agreement
those societies require. You can see how this looks in <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Wall Street
Journal</em></span>'s Blue Feed, Red Feed site
(<a href="http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed" target="_self">graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed</a>), subtitled
&ldquo;See Liberal
Facebook and Conservative Facebook, Side by Side&rdquo;.
</p><p>
I am sure most of the systems driving us into hostile camps are built on
Linux. (Isn't everything now?) So I don't think I'm off base
calling for help here.

Shotcut Video Editor</h4><p>
I just read Shawn Powers' August 2016 <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>
article about his traveling
gear (yes, I am that far behind) and besides being shocked that he uses a
MacBook Air (just kidding, Apple hardware is good enough), I was also
shocked that he uses Final Cut Pro for his video editing.
</p><p>
For the editing needs he described, there is no excuse for not using
the excellent Shotcut video editor (<a href="https://shotcut.org" target="_self">https://shotcut.org</a>).
Besides the fact that it has 
more than enough features, it's open source and available for Linux,
Windows and Mac OS.
</p><p>
I am just wondering what kind of excuse he will give for not adopting
Shotcut for his video editing needs. I am not pressuring him with this,
just playing and using this opportunity to let him know about
Shotcut.
</p><p>
I'm not connected with the project; I just use, advocate and provide
some help with my small knowledge in the Shotcut forum. See also
the videos on YouTube for some help getting started.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Luis
 Sismeiro  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Shawn Powers replies:</b></span> It's easy to feel a
bit defensive with questions like, &ldquo;what's your
excuse?&rdquo;, but tone is often easy to misinterpret in email, so I'm going
to assume this was a friendly message. I don't think I need an excuse,
because I don't think I've done anything wrong. But I'll answer the
question of &ldquo;why&rdquo;, because that's a fair one.
</p><p>
It's possible that some of this was answered in my article, or in issues past,
but really quickly: I have several jobs, and those jobs require me to
have various computer systems. On a daily basis, I truly use Windows,
OS X and Linux. I love open-source software, but I'm not a zealot.
I use whatever tool I can use to get the job done. For <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>,
it makes sense to use Linux software for video editing. However, all the
times I've attempted to do that through the years, it's been inefficient
at best and impossible at the worst. 
</p><p>
I've never tried Shotcut, but now
that you've brought it to my attention, I'll be giving it a try. Heck,
perhaps I'll write about it. The thing that's important to know though
is that if it is a program that crashes or doesn't work well for me,
I likely won't use it.
</p><p>
So after all that, thank you for bringing the project to my attention.
I'll definitely check it out!

Fake News</h4><p>
I read Mr Searls' tantrum in the January 2017 issue with great amusement.
It seems he is not a fan of Donald Trump, but rather than calling for the
death of the Electoral College (the other fad <span   class="emphasis"><em>du
jour</em></span>), he says &ldquo;we need to
hack the news back in a logical direction and away from the fact-free,
misleading and emotion stirring ways that news is made today&rdquo;. In other
words &ldquo;Doc&rdquo; is calling for global &ldquo;fact-checking&rdquo;
on the internet&mdash;aka a
globalized Wikipedia. And who, pray tell, will be trusted with that
curation process? We don't need to look far for an answer, because others
have suggested similar things before with regard to broadcast news:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_Doctrine" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_Doctrine</a>.
</p><p>
So the creative chaos of the Bazaar is good for Linux, but bad in the arena
of politics and news? Interesting how when liberals lose elections their
immediate instincts are to change the Constitutional process and call for
clamping down on radio, TV and now the internet. The First Amendment
applies only to whoever has the correct views. Wouldn't it be better if we
had an educated electorate who could smell truth from fiction on their own?
But how often is critical thinking taught today? Let us take this as a
teachable moment.
</p><p>
Mr Searls goes on to show some pretty graphs and points out that &ldquo;This
kind of study does not show a mandate....&rdquo; True, the election of Trump
alone does not show a mandate, but what does this table show?
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x1c5c580.0x1d555e8"></a><p class="title"><b></b></p><table     summary="12146t1.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>2008(dem/rep)</th><th>2016(dem/rep)</th><th>&nbsp;</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

It's almost as if a vast, right-wing conspiracy infiltrated every
state/local/national news outlet, then hired an army of covert East-bloc
operatives to create &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; on social media, all designed to sway
the election up and down the ballot completely inverting the majority
control at state and federal levels since Barack Obama has been elected.
</p><p>
Hillary would no doubt agree.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Steve
 Langer  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc Searls replies:</b></span> I meant
&ldquo;hack&rdquo; in the broad sense it has been
used here since <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> began in 1994. If you want a specific
definition (or a set of them), consult the Jargon File:
<a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html" target="_self">www.catb.org/jargon/html</a>.
</p><p>
The Trump vs. Hillary contest was maximally interesting at the time I wrote
the column, but it was also beside the main point I tried to make: there
are dangerously dysfunctional ways our democracy now informs itself in the
networked world. &ldquo;Fake news&rdquo; is currently the most obvious example,
although I believe the real problems are deeper and more systematic than
that. However one looks at it, some fixing is required.
</p><p>
It's about the <span   class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> of democracy, not about the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>who</em></span>.

Mars Lander Program</h4><p>
Regarding Dave Taylor's Mars Lander program in the September, October and
November 2016 issues: it's a curious game in a few lines of shell script. I appreciated the
final version. But <tt  >bc</tt> is not so friendly of a tool,
and it puts some unfair mistakes in the game.
Here's a solution for <tt  >bc</tt> uses:

<pre     class="programlisting">

speed=$( $bc &lt;&lt;&lt; "scale=3; $speed + $gravity + $thrust" | sed -e
's/^\([-]*\)\./\10./')
...
altitude=$( $bc &lt;&lt;&lt; "scale=3; $altitude + $speed" | sed -e
's/^\([-]*\)\./\10./')

</pre>
</p><p>
Thank you, good work!

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Jos&eacute;
 Nicolau  <br><br>

<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span> Interesting tweak to the script. I'll have to
send it over to my NASA friends to QA!

kpcli&mdash;KeePass Command-Line Interface</h4><p>

Shawn Powers' Synology Review</h4><p>
Regarding Shawn Powers' &ldquo;My Love Affair with Synology&rdquo; in the
January 2017 issue: many applications are difficult to install directly on a Synology because
Synology does not use a standard repository format like RPM or APT, but
it does support Docker! My tests with Docker have been great so far. I can
build and test Docker images on my Debian server and then copy the finished
images to the Synology for deployment.
</p><p>
In my case, I am trying to get PostGIS/Geoserver/Geonode going. I upgraded
from 1 to 4GB of RAM to support it. I need to support a very small team of
users sharing geospatial data, so we don't need a lot of compute
horsepower, just a shared data store. End users will probably be using QGIS
as a client, so most of the computation will take place on their laptops.
</p><p>
But the use case that I applied to justify buying the Synology was
&ldquo;Synology Cloud Station&rdquo; (it might have come out after you wrote your review).
It is great; files on the server are not kept locked up in a special
container (like ownCloud), so you can seamlessly drop files into an
ordinary folder on the Synology and have them replicate out to your Cloud
Station clients.
</p><p>
This means LAN users can see files directly via Samba, AppleTalk or NFS and
not have to copy them to their own hard drives, but I (working at home)
also get access via synchronization. Working remotely, I can export a large
format map to a PDF file, and it will be uploaded automatically via Cloud
Station sync. Then my team can view the map from the Synology via LAN file
share or web server (File Station) without syncing a copy to their own
laptops.
</p><p>
I love ownCloud by the way, and it will run on a Synology (I tried it out),
and I use it on my own Debian server, but Cloud Station fits our use cases
better.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Brian
 Wilson  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Shawn Powers replies:</b></span> I'm fairly certain Cloud Station has been there for a while, but I have to
admit I haven't tried it. (That will change!) My concerns with running
things on the Synology directly are all horsepower-related. I love it for
things like reverse proxying, web hosting and torrent management. My Plex
Media Server, however, I put on a separate box because I fear the Synology
wouldn't be able to manage the transcoding. I also share your frustration
with the packages provided by Synology, but thankfully, there are some
community-maintained programs that can be downloaded and installed.
</p><p>
The Geo stuff you're doing sounds cool, by the way, and it sounds like a
perfect use case since the CPU demands aren't too high. And thanks again
for the tip about Cloud Station; I'll have to give it a try!

Curl Example in &ldquo;Automated Slack Notifications&rdquo; Doesn't Work</h4><p>
In the &ldquo;Automatic Slack Notifications&rdquo; piece in the December
2016 issue's UpFront section, the
<tt  >curl</tt> command to send a message to Slack doesn't work (at least on my
MacBook). It gives the following error:

<pre     class="programlisting">
curl: (3) [globbing] unmatched close brace/bracket in column 8
</pre>
</p><p>
In fact, the data block should be enclosed in single quotes, not
double quotes.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Khoa
 Le  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Shawn Powers replies:</b></span> Double quotes and single quotes are often the bane of my programming. Half
the time I get errors like you mention here, and the other half of the time
I end up with output that looks like, &ldquo;Thank you $NAME, your contribution
to $THING was greatly appreciated!&rdquo;
</p><p>
In this case, the script worked for me on Linux, and once it worked, I
didn't try it elsewhere. I could have, as I use OS X as well, but sadly, I
didn't. Thanks for pointing out the issue. Hopefully everyone struggling
will see this letter!
