Administrating a Linux server might be complicated, but Webmin can help
you work quickly and safely.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ed4580.0x1fcc240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
When you start administering a Linux
system, one of the biggest challenges is learning exactly what to
do, and how to do it. There simply are too many tools, settings, parameters,
configuration files, d&aelig;mons and what have you to consider. Obviously,
if you ever want to become a full-fledged sysadmin on your own, you
have to learn everything. But, until you
get to that point, you still need to get things done, and you would do
well by installing and using Webmin, a Web-based, comprehensive
administration tool for Linux systems.
</p><p>
Webmin runs on your server and presents a Web-based interface, allowing
you to do all sorts of system administration tasks&mdash;from the very
simple to the very complex ones&mdash;without ever touching a configuration
file or restarting any process or d&aelig;mon on your own. As an aside, it
isn't just any run-of-the-mill tool. If you mention Webmin at a Linux Users
Group reunion, it's guaranteed to raise a lively argument&mdash;much akin to
the &ldquo;using closed graphics drivers&rdquo; or &ldquo;banning all
non-open-source
software from distributions&rdquo; discussions on forums
and chat channels.
</p><p>
For some people, the idea of using anything but the command line to
manage a server is barely short of heretical, and they believe you should not even
consider using Linux if you plan on employing such a tool. (A Linux
user I know once said dismissively, &ldquo;If you want to use graphic tools,
use Windows.&rdquo;) However, for other people, any tool that helps
them avoid mistakes or the need to memorize a lot of parameters is
a welcome addition to their toolset.
</p><p>
Webmin won't
let you avoid actually learning about Linux though. You can't merely start using
it and change configuration settings without knowing perfectly well what you
are doing. If you know what needs be done and how to do
it, Webmin can save you from having to memorize lists of parameters
or configuration files, and it will help you get things done
quickly and safely. On the other hand, don't ever use Webmin
as an experimentation tool. It's quite likely you could really
mess things up.
</p><p>
Webmin runs not only on Linux, but on UNIX and FreeBSD as well. Here's a
partial list
of supported systems and distributions: 
Asianux, Caldera, Debian, FreeBSD, Gentoo (and Sabayon), HP-UX, IBM AIX,
LinuxPPC, Lycoris, Mac OS X, Mandriva (and Mandrake and Conectiva), MEPIS,
NetBSD, OpenBSD, PCLinuxOS, PlayStation Linux, Red Hat (and CentOS and
Fedora), Scientific Linux, SCO OpenServer and UnixWare, Slackware, Sun Java
Desktop System, Sun Solaris, SUSE and OpenSUSE Linux, Turbolinux, Ubuntu
(and derivatives like Kubuntu or Xubuntu), Xandros, Yellow Dog Linux
and Yoper Linux.
</p><p>
If
your favorite distribution isn't included, some
Webmin modules might not work, so be careful. If you are using a distribution
derived from one that is on the list, it's a fair bet you won't
have any problems, but don't say I didn't warn you.
</p><p>
By the way, why this state of affairs? The problem is a lack of
standardization. Distributions use different locations for various
configuration files, and if Webmin 
can't find them, it won't be able to function. This may change for
the better over time, when (if) all distributions fully embrace the Linux
Standard Base (LSB) and comply with the standards related to file
placement. But, that certainly hasn't
happened yet. To mention a simple example, I'm currently using OpenSUSE,
and it uses /srv/www/htdocs as the root for Web sites. Most
other distributions use /var/www/html. So, you can see that a
configuration module might have serious problems finding Web files
if it didn't know about this difference.
</p><p>
What do you need to run Webmin? Just a browser, Perl, a Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) for some functions and the root password. After you
become familiar with Webmin, you'll be able to forget about
ever editing configuration files (like all those in the /etc directory)
or starting, stopping and reloading services. If you set up Webmin
correctly,
you even will be able to administer your server from a remote machine.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ed4580.0x1fcc7c0"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Webmin is available under the GPL, so you can get it without any
problems. The latest version (as of the time of this writing) is 1.380, and
it's being developed actively. The easiest way to install Webmin is
with your favorite package manager. Even though I am an
OpenSUSE user, I prefer Smart to YaST, so a simple <tt  >smart install
webmin</tt>
command did the job for me. If you don't get the latest version
this way, don't worry. You can fix that just by using Webmin itself;
keep reading.
</p><p>
The other method of installation is to go to the download site,
download the appropriate version for your system, and follow the
instructions on the left side of the page. There are two options here.
You can get the full package (with all available
modules), or you can get the minimal edition and add the modules you
require afterward, using Webmin's own update features.
</p><p>
After installing Webmin, you need to start a service. Working as root
(use <tt  >su</tt>), do <tt  >chkconfig webmin
on</tt> (to ensure that Webmin 
starts every time you turn on your machine. Then do <tt  >/etc/init.d/webmin
start</tt> to start it immediately. You're all set.
</p><p>
Using Webmin is simple. Open your favorite browser, and navigate to
http://localhost:10000 (or the equivalent, http://127.0.0.1:10000), and
you'll see Webmin's login page. Next, enter the user name and password for
the system administrator (in many distributions, that would be root,
but Ubuntu and others grant sysadmin rights to specific users instead),
and click the Login button. You could check the Remember login permanently
box, but that's a security risk, so I recommend not doing that.

Figure 2. After logging in, you'll see a menu and system information on the
screen.
</p></div></div><p>
If you want to save yourself some typing, save that address as a bookmark.
For example, in Firefox, either press Ctrl-D
or go to Bookmarks&rarr;Create new bookmark. Alternatively,
for even less typing, create a desktop icon. If you use KDE, right-click on
your desktop, select Create New&rarr;Link to Location
(URL), enter the URL above, and click OK. (The process is
similar if you use GNOME.) You can make it even snazzier by
right-clicking on the newly created icon and changing its image to
/usr/libexec/webmin/images/webmin.xpm (this path might be different for
distributions other
than OpenSUSE). 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ed4580.0x1fccef8"></a>
Upgrade</h2></div></div><p>
Once you have Webmin installed correctly, upgrading it or adding more
modules is a breeze. On the left-side menu, select Webmin&rarr;Webmin
Configuration, and you'll see a screen full of icons. If you click 
Upgrade Webmin (the up-pointing blue arrow), you can upgrade
Webmin itself from the Internet. Note that you can click on Scheduled
Update to set up a cron task that will connect to the Web and
download all needed updates on its own. This is a safe option (for
you'll definitely get all updates and bug fixes as soon as possible),
but it's also an unsafe one (should the Webmin Web site itself ever be
hacked).
So, I leave it up to you to decide whether you want to do this.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9993f3.large.jpg"><img src="9993f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 4. You can upgrade Webmin or add new modules without any other
tools.
</p></div></div><p>
On the same Webmin Configuration page, if you click the Webmin
Modules icon (the one with small boxes), you can browse
all available modules on the Webmin site or even download third-party
modules from other sites. Choosing the Standard Module option 
provides a pop-up window with dozens of modules (I haven't been able to
figure out whether there's a method to the list's organization). If you click
a module name, and then click Install Module, Webmin downloads it
and sets it up for you.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ed4580.0x1fcd420"></a>
Users and Groups</h2></div></div><p>
Before moving on, let's talk about security and users. Webmin has its
own users, which are not the same as the operating system users. The
very first time you log in, it automatically creates a root user. You
shouldn't let every user work with this account. It's safer if
you create specific accounts and restrict each one to needed
functions. To do this, click Webmin on the left-side menu, and then
Webmin Users.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9993f5.large.jpg"><img src="9993f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Webmin has its own database of users.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9993f6.large.jpg"><img src="9993f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Using password restrictions provides higher security levels.
</p></div></div><p>
When adding users, you can opt to give them a specific Webmin password
or use &ldquo;Unix authentication&rdquo;. The former option is usually safer (but
only if users choose a password different from their standard passwords),
and the latter option is the friendliest one. The Password Restrictions
screen lets you set specific controls, so users can't use too
short, simple or easy-to-guess passwords.
</p><p>
Instead of assigning rights to each user, you can create
groups. Go to Webmin&rarr;Webmin Users, and click Create a new Webmin
group. Select what functions should be allowed to members of this group,
and finish by clicking Create. From now on, when you create new
users, you can specify to which group they belong, and their
rights will be assigned automatically.
</p><p>
You also should take a look at the Unix User Synchronization option,
which allows the automatic synchronization of Linux users and Webmin
users. You can set it up so that every time a Linux user is
created/deleted,
a corresponding Webmin user also is created/deleted. The Unix User Authentication
option also might be of interest if you have many users who should be
allowed access to Webmin. Additionally, you can use the View
Login Sessions to check whatever the users might have done.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ed4580.0x1fcd9f8"></a>
Using Webmin</h2></div></div><p>
Using Webmin is quite simple, as you might already have guessed from the
examples above. Choose a category from the menu on the left side of the
screen, and it opens up, showing a list of available modules. The
main page for each module usually includes a Module Config link on
its top-left corner, which lets you do some configuration, and a
Help link that provides documentation on the
module's functions. Here are the categories:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Webmin: provides general configuration, including language and
theme selection (you can use Webmin in more than 40 languages), upgrades,
module installation, logging options, log browsing and more. If you
want to make your installation more secure, check the Authentication
option (allowing, among other things, protection against brute-force
password-cracking attacks), and also check IP Access Control and Blocked Hosts
and Users. If you have the Servers module installed, you can use
it to scan for other Webmin servers and administrate them
remotely&mdash;although it won't be as speedy.
</p></li><li><p>
System: covers many different functions. You can control backups
with the third-party option for the Bacula backup system or with a far
simpler filesystem backup that uses either tar or the dump-and-restore family of commands to save directories to tape or to a file
on another filesystem. Bootup and Shutdown lets you specify which
services will be run at which levels, and also (obviously) to reboot or
shut down the system. For user management, check Users and Groups (which
allows you to create, edit or delete both users and groups) and Change
Passwords, whose function is obvious. The Disk and Network Filesystems
module
lets you mount or unmount devices and filesystems, and Disk Quotas
will be of interest if you have assigned file space quotas to users. You
can schedule commands to run once (think atd) or have periodical jobs
(think cron). You can get a top-like display of processes (but it
won't refresh on its own) with the Running Processes option, and you
can find plenty of information by clicking on a process id. Finally,
to cut the list short, the Software Packages option allows you to
install or remove a software package on the server remotely.
</p></li><li><p>
Servers: this category has to do with all the possible servers you might be
running, including Web-related functions, such as Apache or FTP; mail
functions (Fetchmail, Postfix, Qmail, Sendmail) and filters (ProcMail,
SpamAssassin); file sharing (Samba); databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL);
network functions (DHCP, SSH, DNS, SLP); proxying (Squid); and several
similar functions. There are several options for each of these
modules, so you'll want to click on each of them to see the available
features.
</p></li><li><p>
Networking: covers more-specific network-related options, including
configuration (interfaces, routing, gateways, DNS client, host addresses);
services; connection (ADSL client, Bandwidth Monitoring, PPP, SSL tunnels,
VPN); security (Kerberos5, IPsec); firewalls (the Linux Firewall
provides an iptables-based configuration, and there's an option for the
Shoreline shorewall firewall too); and more, including NFS and NIS.
</p></li><li><p>
Hardware: lets you control disks and volumes (including LVM, RAID
and disk partitions; you also can use Smart to check the status of your
disk units); printers; CD burning; and the system clock. If you are
using GRUB, you can edit its options from here too.
</p></li><li><p>
Clusters: includes several options you will use only if you are
running two or more machines forming a cluster, with the Heartbeat
monitor&mdash;a rather more specialized setup, which proves once again that
you need to know what you're doing before starting to mess with Webmin.
</p></li><li><p>
Others: a catchall for several options, including a command shell
(implemented via a Java applet) for full console access, or Custom
Commands, which allows you to set up and execute commonly used commands,
with optional parameter substitution&mdash;a fine tool if you need to make
some commands available to inexperienced users. There also is a File
Manager (another Java applet), SSH/Telnet remote login, an HTTP tunnel
for accessing Web pages, data files upload and download, and more.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Can you benefit from Webmin? Who should use it? Jamie Cameron, Webmin's
creator, said this program &ldquo;may be better suited for less-experienced users who are unfamiliar with configuration file formats than
for enterprise sysadmins who already have a detailed understanding of
UNIX&rdquo;.
I fully agree with that opinion, although I'd add that even if you are
quite familiar with configuration files and the like, you might welcome
an easier (and sometimes quicker) way of doing things.
</p><p>
Webmin packs a quite impressive, always growing, number of functions,
but it allows you to use only what you require, through clear menus
and forms, and it detects possible errors before they can
do any harm. You should at least consider it for its learning value,
because you can examine configuration files before and after each change,
and, thus, learn how something was (or should have been) done. 
You can't avoid learning about each function
before diving in, but Webmin provides at
least an easier road to becoming a more proficient sysadmin.

Usermin is a close relative of Webmin, designed to allow end users to
manage several administrative functions on their own, such as changing
passwords and user details, managing mail (though a standard
e-mail client is a better solution) and more. Usermin is available
by default when you install Webmin. You can access it by navigating
to http://127.0.0.1:20000, where you'll see an interface very much like
Webmin's, but with far fewer functions. In fact, you can configure which
functions will appear with Webmin. Start that program, go to
Webmin&rarr;Usermin Configuration&rarr;Available Modules, and select which modules
should be available via Usermin. You don't need to log in to use Usermin;
it will assume the rights of the current user.
