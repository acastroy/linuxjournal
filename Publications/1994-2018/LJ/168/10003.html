How to tweak your Eee PC.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae1580.0xbd9250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
ASUS' diminutive sub-notebook, the Eee PC, has so far exceeded expectations
and is sold out virtually everywhere. Its simple interface and
wallet-friendly pricing have contributed to making the Eee the most popular
gadget this season.
</p><p>
It's in the hands of the power user that the Eee really shines.
With hardware support already taken care of, the Eee offers an
opportunity for beginning-to-intermediate Linux users to customise
themselves a flexible Linux-based tool using the Eee's easy or full desktop
mode.
</p><p>
In this article, we take you through tweaking your Eee, although in the
interest of preserving your warranty, most of the hacks here are
focused on software. The first and most important hack is to read the
manual that came with your Eee to make sure you're completely up to date on
everything. When you read the manual (because you are going
to read it, right?), you'll notice that ASUS mentions the keyboard shortcut
Ctrl-Alt-T to launch a terminal. Gaining root on the default Eee install is
as simple as issuing the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo -s
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae1580.0xbd9568"></a></h2></div></div><p>
There is no password; any person who can open a terminal is able to gain
root.
</p><p>
ASUS' easy mode uses a customised IceWM (<a href="http://www.icewm.org" target="_self">www.icewm.org</a>), a standard
X11 window manager that's been around for a very long time. It's relatively
easy to customise to your liking. The first step is creating a
directory for local modifications. Open a terminal using the aforementioned
keyboard shortcut, and type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir ~/.icewm
cp /etc/X11/icewm/* /home/user/.icewm/
</pre>
</p><p>
This creates a local customisation directory and copies the ASUS IceWM
configuration into it, ready for you to modify. As not all of the software
that ships with the Eee is accessible through the easy mode launcher, 
the first useful thing to tweak on the Eee is to add the IceWM panel menu
and edit it to add those applications that aren't exposed through the easy
mode interface.
</p><p>
To enable the menu, edit ~/.icewm/config, and scroll down to the option
named TaskBarShowStartMenu. Change the 0 in the uncommented value to
1, and save the file. You need to restart your Eee for the menu to show
up:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#  Show 'Start' menu on task bar
# TaskBarShowStartMenu=1 # 0/1
TaskBarShowStartMenu=1
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10003f1.large.jpg"><img src="10003f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The IceWM Menu, with the Menu File in the Background
</p></div></div><p>
To edit the menu, open ~/.icewm/menu in your favourite editor. The menu
format is pretty simple, following the syntax:

<pre     class="programlisting">
prog label icon command
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae1580.0xbd9b40"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where <tt  >label</tt>, <tt  >icon</tt> and
<tt  >command</tt> are replaced with the appropriate
entries for the application you want to launch. For example, to add an
entry that launches Konsole, the KDE terminal emulator, you would create an
entry as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
prog Konsole konsole konsole
</pre>
</p><p>
Submenus are described with the following syntax:

<pre     class="programlisting">
menu "Label" {

}
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae1580.0xbd9e58"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Program entries or further submenus are defined between the curly
braces.
</p><p>
The first thing we all thought on using the Eee when we first
received it was &ldquo;the Windows XP theme doesn't look attractive on XP, let
alone on Linux. How the heck do we change this abomination?&rdquo;
</p><p>
You'll be pleased to know that this is extremely simple, now that the menu is
enabled. The biggest theme repository for IceWM is at
<a href="http://themes.freshmeat.net/browse/925" target="_self">themes.freshmeat.net/browse/925</a>, with hundreds of
themes from which to choose.
Once you've downloaded a theme, create the folder ~/.icewm/themes,
and extract the theme to that folder. It will now be selectable from the
IceWM menu under Settings&rarr;Themes.

Figure 2. A broad selection of attractive themes are available for IceWM.
</p></div></div><p>
You can find a wide range of other customisations by reading the comments in
the ~/.icewm/preferences file. Some notable ones are showing
the workspace switcher on the panel and adding a CPU meter.
Traditional window manager settings, such as focus model, are available as well.
</p><p>
With a built-in Webcam, it's a shame that the Eee PC didn't ship with the
Linux beta of Skype that allows video calling. It is, however, easy
to install by hand. Navigate to <a href="http://www.skype.com/download/skype/linux" target="_self">www.skype.com/download/skype/linux</a>,
and elect to download not the current stable version, but the beta. When it
asks you to select your distribution, download the package for Debian Etch.
Once you've downloaded it to disk, open a terminal and navigate to where the
file was saved. Type the following to install the package:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dpkg -i  skype-debian_2.0.0.27-1_i386.deb
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae1580.0xbda3d8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The version number of the package may have
changed since the time of this writing. As this upgrades the version of Skype
already installed, the Skype launcher will launch the new version.

video calling for us.

During the course of adding applications to the menu, the observant will
notice that the Eee ships with most of KDE installed. During its
development phase, the Eee exposed an option to enable a full desktop mode
with a complete KDE 3.4 desktop. The most elegant solution for enabling
the full desktop is to install a package that does the configuration for you
from <a href="http://wiki.eeeuser.com/howto:getkde" target="_self">wiki.eeeuser.com/howto:getkde</a>. This package essentially
downloads the packages for kicker and ksmserver, and modifies the ASUS startup
scripts. It adds an option to log in to full desktop mode from the easy mode
shutdown dialog. To get back into easy mode, there is an option in the
K menu. This page also details the manual methods for enabling full desktop
mode.

Adding more software from a Xandros or Debian repository is the next
logical step in customising the operating system that ships with the Eee.
For us, the Eee requires only the addition of Emacs and Subversion to be a
great portable hacking tool. You can use any Debian Sarge repository or a
Xandros 4.0 one, as shown below. There are a few caveats though.
As the Xandros running on the Eee is heavily customised by ASUS, it's
very easy to end up with the Eee in an unbootable state if you allow apt to
upgrade too much. Although it's not a complete solution, apt pinning can be
used to ensure that the ASUS repository always takes priority for a package. 
</p><p>
Add your repository to /etc/apt/source.list with your favourite text editor
as root, either your local Debian Sarge repository or the Xandros one
below:

<pre     class="programlisting">
deb http://xnv4.xandros.com/4.0/pkg xandros4.0-xn main 
 &#8618;contrib non-free
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, create the file /etc/apt/preferences, and add the lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Package: *
Pin: origin update.eepc.asus.com
Pin-Priority: 999
</pre>
</p><p>
As apt sources default to a lower priority, this ensures that packages from the
ASUS repository are prioritised. It's still possible though to break your
Eee by installing packages willy-nilly. If it looks as though an action is
going to upgrade a large number of packages, especially if it looks like
what it's upgrading is all of KDE, cancel the change.
</p><p>
This limitation can be extremely frustrating if you want to make more
drastic changes to your Eee PC's installed packages. Another option is to
install a generic Linux distribution on the Eee. eeeXubuntu
(<a href="http://wiki.eeeuser.com/ubuntu:eeexubuntu:home" target="_self">wiki.eeeuser.com/ubuntu:eeexubuntu:home</a>) is a version of the
Xubuntu 7.10 distribution with Eee-specific drivers integrated and tweaks
for low-resolution displays. It's an excellent choice if you want a more
modern distribution on your Eee but would prefer not to compile the drivers
from ASUS by hand. 
</p><p>
The wiki page has in-depth instructions on how to
create a bootable USB stick for your Eee. Boot your Eee from the USB stick
by pressing Esc at boot time to get to the boot options menu, and from
the GRUB bootloader, select the option to load eeeXubuntu with Eee-specific
drivers and fixes. From there, it's all very familiar. Click the Install
icon on the desktop once the live CD loads, and navigate your way through
the Ubuntu installer.
</p><p>
If your Eee has 512MB or more of memory, you probably can get away with not
creating a swap partition. In our testing, running Firefox, Pidgin and
Thunderbird, the Eee was using approximately 300MB of memory, minus
buffers/caching. If your Eee has 1,024MB or more of memory, you'll never
notice the difference.
</p><p>
Opting out of swap, however, does have the side effect that hibernate to disk
is disabled. The Eee does have suspend to RAM support under eeeXubuntu, but
this level of suspend does consume a fair amount of battery. Leave your Eee
suspended for 24 hours, and expect to see your battery down to half when
you resume it.

The simplest and most rewarding Eee hardware mod is upgrading the built-in
memory.
Note: this mod requires removing a sticker that claims its removal will
void your warranty. According to a public statement by ASUS at
<a href="http://usa.asus.com/news_show.aspx?id=9223" target="_self">usa.asus.com/news_show.aspx?id=9223</a>, this is not the
case, and
upgrading your memory will not void the warranty on your Eee. However,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> takes no responsibility for any damages to your Eee or loss
of warranty incurred by following this advice.
</p><p>
The Eee PC takes a single SODIMM of DDR2667, in either 512, 1,024 or 2,048MB.
That's right, the Eee PC can be upgraded to an impressive 2GB of memory.
</p><p>
To upgrade the memory on your Eee, you need a set of small electronics
screwdrivers and a clean surface that's safe for handling static-sensitive
equipment.
</p><p>
If you haven't installed memory before, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> recommends you enlist
the help of a professional or a hardware-minded friend.
</p><p>
Ensure that the Eee is shut down (not suspended), and unplug it from the power.
Turn the Eee upside down and remove the battery.
</p><p>
Using a very small Phillips screwdriver, remove the two screws in the
memory panel. One is covered by a sticker that will tear easily if you
simply remove the screw as though the sticker was not there.
</p><p>
Use a small flatblade screwdriver very carefully or a fingernail to
lever up the memory compartment. Put the memory compartment cover
and the screws to one side.
</p><p>
To remove the memory that shipped with your Eee, carefully use a pair of
small screwdrivers or your fingers to lever the clips outward. The memory
module will pop upward when it is free of the clips. Remove the module
from the slot, taking care to touch only the very outside edges of the
module.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10003f6.large.jpg"><img src="10003f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Removing the Module
</p></div></div><p>
Place the module aside in a static-safe place, and remove the new module
from its packaging. Place it in the slot at a 45-degree angle, as shown in 
Figure 7, taking care that the notch on the module matches the key on
the slot. When the module's base is securely slotted in, it can be
carefully lowered into position by pushing the top corners of the module
backward with your fingers, so that it lies flat against the Eee's motherboard.
The metal clips should snap over the sides of the module with a satisfying
click when it's properly in place. Once the memory is secure, replace the
memory compartment cover and ensure that all sides have clicked down. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10003f7.large.jpg"><img src="10003f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
If you're anything like us, at this point, you'll hunt all over the desk
searching for the screws only to find them 20 minutes later stuck to the
magnetic closure on the MacBook. Replace the two screws to secure the
memory compartment cover, and insert the battery again. It's always a good
idea to run memtest86 over any new memory you install, which is an option
from any recent Ubuntu live CD or the eeeXubuntu bootable USB stick if you
made one earlier.
</p><p>
It's pretty easy to see how the Eee has taken the personal computer market
by storm. It's cheap, friendly and oh-so-very hackable, with something for
everyone. There are myriad other hacks not covered here, from installing
Linux distributions and adding the drivers yourself to soldering
additional gadgets to the motherboard. In fact, that's what we're off to do
right after we submit this article&mdash;solder a mutilated Bluetooth dongle to
the motherboard, as now we won't get in trouble if we break it.
</p><p>
Have fun hacking your Eee, but remember&mdash;installing Windows is cruel to
Eee PCs and not endorsed by <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>!
