Put Linux to work to save energy, money and the environment.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x165e580.0x1756298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
A new age of environmental awareness appears to be upon us. The meteoric
economic rise of India, China and other large countries has not only
unleashed a spike in petroleum prices and the spectre of dry gas pumps in
our lifetime, but also has raised fears of our fragile planet's ability to
support an SUV-lifestyle for billions. Furthermore, the scientific
community feeds us daily evidence of our climate changing right before our
eyes. The problems seem so daunting. What can we do to fight back and do
well by the planet? 
</p><p>
Although hybrid vehicles, wind turbines and ethanol get the green glory,
many people in IT, including in our own Linux and Open Source communities, deserve
attention for their green initiatives. With a global problem to solve that
requires creativity, transparency and massive collaboration, who else
would you call but the Linux folks? This article explains how Mother
Nature's Mayday calls have inspired our community to innovate and do more
with fewer resources. Whether your motivation is to green the earth or
save greenbacks though improved efficiency, read on to find out
more about how you can go green, and save green, with Linux.

How Is Linux Going Green?</h2></div></div><p>
A typical Linux server gulps about 225 Watts or more of power, meaning
that the millions of Linux servers out there, now at around a 27% market
share, are responsible for nearly 5 million tons of carbon emissions
annually. Furthermore, Springboard Research recently reported that an
average-size server has the same carbon footprint as a mid-size
four-wheel-drive vehicle. In response to this and other daunting evidence,
the color of Linux is purposefully going green. The number of green,
Linux-based initiatives and projects is proliferating, and I'd like to
share some of them with you. In this article, I discuss 
initiatives to save energy related to the Linux kernel,
distributions and applications; virtualization; and exceptionally green
Linux-based products (such as hardware). 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x165e580.0x1756608"></a>
There's Initiative in Those Initiatives</h2></div></div><p>
An initiative is only as good as the people and resources behind it. Three
green-Linux initiatives have formed recently: two deep-pocketed ones, 
IBM's Big Green Linux initiative and Intel's Lesswatts.org; and a dot-org
effort, the Linux Foundation's Green Linux Initiative.
</p><p>
In August 2007, IBM launched its Big Green Linux initiative, intended to
help its clients integrate Linux into the enterprise &ldquo;as a way to reduce
costs and energy consumption by building cooler data centers&rdquo;, says 
IBM. Big Green Linux is a subset of Project Big Green, a broader
initiative to reduce energy consumption in the data center, both internally
and for its clients. Although sparse to date, some of the Big Green Linux
initiatives have included improved data-center ergonomics, encouraging
server consolidation onto System p servers and System z mainframes,
expanding on Linux innovations like the tickless kernel and collaboration
on power management with the Linux community.
</p><p>
Intel is another IT titan trying to go green at both the processor and
application levels. The firm readily admits that its green innovations 
historically have been further ahead on the hardware side than the software
side. For instance, Intel first focused power management improvements on
the mobile Centrino processor and is now migrating those technologies to
server platforms. Regrettably, the advantageous hardware
engineering often exists but remains unexploited. 
</p><p>
In order to bridge the gulf between hardware and software development,
Intel created Lesswatts.org. The site is a nexus of collaboration on
projects that &ldquo;drive improvements in power consumption that will lead to a
cleaner environment and allow companies to spend less money powering their
IT infrastructure.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Some of the projects included on Lesswatts.org are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
PowerTOP: a Linux-based tool that helps find programs that are needlessly
consuming extra power when a computer is idle, as well as the magnitude of
overconsumption.
</p></li><li><p>
Power Policy Manager: a layered, system-wide power policy framework that
provides a way for users to select multiple power policies to fit their
systems. 
</p></li><li><p>
Processor Power Management: a project to leverage the
power management features of Intel processors fully. Lesswatts.org contains all
the features, solutions and enhancements related to processor power
management. One example is the Intel Dynamic Acceleration Technology,
which allows one processor core to deliver extra performance while the
other core is idle. 
</p></li><li><p>
Display and Graphics Power Saving: a project that aims to exploit
the power-saving features of Intel's graphics chipsets without sacrificing
performance.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Besides those listed above and several other projects, Lesswatts.org contains
numerous power-saving documents, whitepapers and tips, such as utilizing
the Aggressive Link Power Management feature on SATA controllers or
utilizing Gigabit Ethernet only when a system needs it.
</p><p>
Lesswatts.org is directed by Intel's Open Source Technology Center, the
firm's nexus of Linux and open-source initiatives. 
</p><p>
Over on the dot-org side of things is the Linux Foundation's (LF)
Green Linux Initiative. The Linux Foundation is a product of the 2007
fusion of Open Source Development Labs and the Free Standards Group, whose
mission is to support Linus Torvalds' and other efforts that move Linux
forward technologically and out in the field. According to Amanda
McPherson, LF's Director of Marketing, LF was inspired to set up a Green
Linux Workgroup in June 2007, at its Collaboration Summit, where &ldquo;concern
for the planet [and] power management emerged as a top project to work
on.&rdquo;
LF, says McPherson, is pleased with how the tickless kernel, PowerTOP and
other projects have progressed, adding that &ldquo;developments by the community
have been very impressive over the last few years&rdquo; and that enterprises are
gradually adopting them as the technologies are supported in the
conservative enterprise distributions. &ldquo;Enterprises are understandably
cautious about upgrading kernel/distribution versions and taking advantage
of new features. As time goes on, these features will be used more and
more.&rdquo; The Green Group is ramped up or down according to project needs and
will ramp up again this-coming June to address potential new issues, such as
&ldquo;Energy Star compliance and better optimization of device drivers for power
management.&rdquo; McPherson also cited the importance of Intel and IBM
&ldquo;rallying behind this topic&rdquo; to move it forward.  
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x165e580.0x1756ef8"></a>
Tickless Idle in Linux</h2></div></div><p>
The two most significant recent innovations in Linux regarding power
management are tickless idle and virtualization. The various
Linux distribution makers deserve credit for supporting these innovations,
integrating them into their distributions and pushing forward initiatives
like Lesswatts.org. 
</p><p>
The idea behind tickless idle is that Linux, starting with kernel 2.6.21
for 32-bit and 2.6.23 for 64-bit machines, keeps track of time in a
completely new way in order to take advantage of low-power states in modern
processors. The strategy involves keeping the processor in its lowest
power state for as long as possible, interrupting that state only when
necessary. For instance, on an Intel Core 2 Duo processor, the power
states, or C states, vary between 1.2 and 35 Watts&mdash;a significant
difference. Before kernel 2.6.21, Linux pulled the processor out of the
lower C state with a timer tick to inform the processor of the need to
perform housekeeping tasks. This tick, occurring every few milliseconds,
functionally reduced the usefulness of the lower-power states. Without the
tick, Linux now chills out and conserves power until the next timer event
is scheduled to occur. Multisecond idle periods now are possible. 
</p><p>
The power savings from tickless idle can have positive benefits in any type
of machine&mdash;from longer battery life on brawny notebooks to significantly
lower electricity bills for home users and data centers. 
</p><p>
Although Intel, through the Lesswatts.org Project, is more public about
exploiting the tickless kernel and publicizing its power management tools,
representatives at AMD assured me that their less-publicized initiatives
and partnerships in the Linux community are just as or more significant
than Intel's. Margaret Lewis, AMD Director of Commercial Solutions and
Software Strategy, asserted that the tickless-kernel features are fully
supported on both AMD's 32-bit and 64-bit processors. Furthermore,
Brent Kerby, Product Manager for AMD Opteron, noted that AMD's PowerNOW!,
Cool'n'Quiet and CoolCore technologies, including the dynamic adjustment of
individual processor-core frequencies (and not just in pairs), all function
well and automatically under Linux and contribute greatly to power savings.
Lewis added, &ldquo;These technologies give you a lot more power management
control and are cumulatively perhaps more important than the tickless
kernel.&rdquo; AMD also emphasized its green efforts in other areas, such as the
Green Grid, a consortium of companies working together to address
environmental issues holistically throughout the data center, addressing
hardware, software, building design, storage, cooling and more.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x165e580.0x17571b8"></a>
Attendant Applications: PowerTOP</h2></div></div><p>
Linus Torvalds has stated that work on the tickless kernel is mostly
done and, thus, can take advantage of low-power states in processors;
however, much
remains to be done to maximize its effect. Although Linux gladly would remain
dormant, other superfluous, busybody processes from various applications
keep waking it needlessly. To solve this problem, Intel's Arjan van de Ven
created PowerTOP, a tool that finds culprits in the kernel and user space
that are bothering the processor needlessly and reports the energy wasted
by those activities. PowerTOP also reports on the time spent in each power
state. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9874f1.large.jpg"><img src="9874f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Intel's PowerTOP tool helps 
sleuth out applications that are consuming extra power needlessly.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x165e580.0x1757478"></a>
Virtualization</h2></div></div><p>
Making more efficient use of existing computing resources through
virtualization, such as consolidating multiple virtual servers onto fewer
physical machines, has been a major trend in the Linux space. Little do we
realize we are saving a great deal of juice in the process. Thus, not only
does one reduce server sprawl and the expense of purchasing and
maintaining more machines, but also electrical power utilization is improved by
approximately 10&ndash;20 Watts per idle virtual machine, according to AMD.
Additionally, as Jon 'maddog' Hall says, &ldquo;Utilizing fewer systems and
sharing the load is
goodness.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The power savings from virtualization on Linux has been enhanced
further by the arrival of tickless idle. The existence of ticks in each virtual
machine would otherwise put multiple extra loads on the virtualization
platform and greatly reduce efficiency and the number of VMs per machine.
For instance, if you have 30 VMs on one machine, with each one creating
hundreds of ticks per second, a significant load is created before any real
work is done. 
</p><p>
Beyond virtualization itself, a number of vendors are exploring ways to
manage their virtualization strategies to streamline their
data-center operations and reduce power usage further. One example is Cassatt
Corporation's Active Power Management Technology, which has released a
platform-agnostic product to turn off servers safely when they are not
needed or idle. Rather than leaving machines automatically running round
the clock or relying on manual decision making, administrators can set
priorities and policies to mandate how, where and when to power down idle
servers, as well as power them back up. The net result is better
management of both virtual and physical infrastructure. Interesting for
us Linux-lovers, Active Power Management is easy to install and
nondisruptive, as it relies on internal power controllers found inside most
servers rather than on installation of software on managed servers. 
</p><p>
Scalent V/OE offers another approach, namely dynamic server repurposing.
V/OE allows administrators to shift their data centers between different
configurations or go from dead bare metal to live, running, connected
servers in just a few minutes and without physical intervention.
Scalent's Director of Marketing, Alana Achterkirchen, pointed out that
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E), California's largest electric utility,
offers rebates to companies that deploy IT virtualization projects that
result in the removal of computing equipment. The incentive, says PG&amp;E,
&ldquo;is based on the amount of energy saved, predicted through a calculation
model&rdquo; and ranges from $150&ndash;$300 per server. Way to go,
California!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x165e580.0x1757790"></a>
What Are the Distributions Doing?</h2></div></div><p>
The main distribution providers are core contributors to many a green
project and are integrating them into their releases as rapidly as
possible. For instance, Red Hat, Ubuntu and SUSE Linux all committed
publicly to contribute to and make available the innovations from
Lesswatts.org.
</p><p>
Nick Car, Red Hat Chief Technical Spokesperson, emphasized that his firm's green
efforts &ldquo;extend considerably beyond consolidation&rdquo;, including
&ldquo;the
provision of highly optimized paravirt device drivers for
fully virtualized guests.&rdquo; This means more and more systems will be
able to be virtualized, broadening the utilization and impact of the
technology.
</p><p>
Car also touted Red Hat's collaboration with chip vendors and Open Source
communities to optimize power consumption in areas such as:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
CPUfreq clock scaling in collaboration with Intel. Clock scaling allows
for changing the clock speed of the running CPU on the fly, thus reducing
the power the CPU consumes.
</p></li><li><p>
AMD's PowerNow! speed throttling and power-saving technology (includes
CPUfreq work).
</p></li><li><p>
Intel's PowerTOP Project and using it to identify power-inefficient
algorithms on all server applications, as well as to audit the kernel for
pollers. Car points out that &ldquo;We have been doing this work for the past
year, and it has accumulated to the point where we are seeing meaningful power
savings.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
Suspend/resume/hibernate work on laptops, including features such as
automatic screen backlight intensity reduction as a laptop becomes idle.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Red Hat also will integrate the new tickless kernel in Fedora 9 and
subsequently in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. &ldquo;Red Hat has been a key
developer of this technology&rdquo;, says Car, &ldquo;which allows the kernel to
properly idle itself when appropriate.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Over in Ubuntu's camp, Gerry Carr, Canonical's Marketing Manager, stressed
that his company &ldquo;is not directly involved in green computing per se, but
indirectly we are massively involved&rdquo;, adding that &ldquo;we built an enabling
technology for green computing without it being directly built for this
purpose.&rdquo; Regarding virtualization, Carr also stressed the &ldquo;optimization
of the kernel for paravirt ops, which is a long way of saying you can
run more VMs on less iron using Ubuntu, thus saving energy
there.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Carr also highlighted the presence of Ubuntu on low-cost computers, which
typically utilize less energy, such as Intel's Classmate PC. The Classmate
is targeted at students in poor countries. Similarly, Ubuntu actively
supports thin-client computing through partnership with NComputing and
other providers. One example is the deployment of terminal desktops for
every child in the Republic of Macedonia (180,000 terminals) on only 20,000
PCs.
</p><p>
Carr further explained that the Xubuntu version of its distribution &ldquo;is
built specifically to run on older, less-powerful machines and thus extend
their shelf life significantly&rdquo;, and that it has evidence that
&ldquo;a PC
running Ubuntu is significantly more power-efficient than one running
Windows&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Finally, Carr notes that &ldquo;As an organisation, we are great believers in the
multiplier effect, in providing the means for others to take action. We
couldn't try to directly support the number of initiatives that happen
purely by providing a product that is free to use and redistribute and that
we freely maintain.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Regarding SUSE Linux, Roger Levy, Senior Vice President and General Manager
of Open Platform Solutions for Novell, noted that his company is focused on
&ldquo;improvements in policy-driven power management and system monitors for
servers, along with better suspend functionality for laptops&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x165e580.0x1b504e0"></a>
Green PCs and Other Equipment</h2></div></div><p>
Just because a piece of hardware is cheap, doesn't mean it is cheapest in
the long run. Whether that hardware is expensive in environmental terms
is harder to calculate, but is fortunately becoming easier as hardware
providers seek competitive advantage via green credentials and tools to
evaluate product impact.
</p><p>
The difference between running Linux with its tickless kernel on AMD
or Intel processors is probably a wash. Both companies have strong
commitments to environmental protection and reducing energy consumption. A
more important choice is whether your hardware solution is built with an
environmental ethos in mind and offers maximum power conservation,
avoidance of toxins and recycling options. A few exceptional,
Linux-focused companies are worth considering in this regard.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x165e580.0x1b50640"></a>
Zonbu PC and Laptop</h2></div></div><p>
Zonbu is perhaps the hardware provider most obsessed with being green and
sees its environmental laurels as core selling points. The company offers
two interesting and green machines, the Zonbu PC and the Zonbu Notebook.
Both machines are pre-installed with Gentoo Linux and offer environmental
advantages like few other PCs do. Zonbu also offers interesting features, such
as on-line storage plans and separate versions for newbies and experienced
users. (See the February 2008 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> for a detailed review
of the Zonbu desktop.)
</p><p>
Zonbu is attempting to cover all the environmental bases, which is
summed up in its Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) Gold rating
for strong overall environmental performance. Only 12 desktop machines
have reached this mark to date. The Zonbu sisters deliver significant gains
in energy efficiency, achieving the US EPA Energy Star 4 rating. This
translates to a power requirement of only 10&ndash;15 Watts, depending on the
load. Most PCs of similar caliber (without monitor) will gulp 60&ndash;100 Watts
or more, depending on numerous factors. Zonbu's marketing people tell me
that you'll save over 1,200 kilowatt hours during the course of a year, which
seems generous given their assumption that a typical PC averages 175 Watts.
However, even with a more-conservative savings estimate of 600 kilowatt
hours per year, you'll probably save more than $60 on electricity during the
course of a year, based on a cost of $0.10 per kilowatt hour. 
</p><p>
A unique Zonbu bonus involves automatic purchases of carbon offsets from
the firm Climate Trust, which invests in projects that reduce net carbon
emissions society-wide, such as wind energy or tree planting. In addition,
Zonbu builds its hardware with recycling in mind and follows the European
RoHS Directive, such that no more than 25% of the hazardous substances (such
as
lead, mercury and cadmium) that go into typical desktops are used. Finally,
when you're ready to upgrade, Zonbu takes back your old device and foots
the bill for its recycling. Zonbu says it is &ldquo;determined that no Zonbu
device contributes to the problem&rdquo; of e-waste.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9874f2.large.jpg"><img src="9874f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The new Zonbu laptop follows in the green
footsteps of its older kin, the Zonbu PC. Zonbu even will offset your
carbon emissions for you!
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x165e580.0x1b50ab8"></a>
Save a Ton(ne) with Koolu</h2></div></div><p>
Not much different philosophically from Zonbu is Koolu, a Canadian firm that
aims to save a tonne (Canadian for ton) of carbon emissions with its
thin clients and Net appliances. With Jon 'maddog' Hall as Koolu's CTO and
Ambassador, you are sure that the concept is robust and open source. The
products run Ubuntu.
</p><p>
Koolu's (and many other firms') thin clients, says Hall, require only 10
Watts or less and &ldquo;allow better sharing of CPU power, memory, disk and
even people power&rdquo;. Meanwhile, Koolu claims that the fanless Net
appliances will save you up to 90% on electricity costs and 50% on PC
capital costs. Furthermore, like the Zonbu twins, Koolu's products are
RoHS-compliant. Unfortunately, Koolu does not currently offer a recycling
program, nor does it purchase carbon offsets.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x165e580.0x1b50c70"></a>
Other Ways to Make a Difference</h2></div></div><p>
Besides the above information, there are many other ways to compute 
that are gentler on the environment. Here are a few suggestions:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Avoid e-waste by avoiding Windows Vista&mdash;a 2007 study by Softchoice
Corporation and amplified by Greenpeace stated that &ldquo;50% of all PCs
are below Windows Vista's basic system requirements&rdquo; and &ldquo;94% are
not ready for Windows Vista Premium edition&rdquo;. A similar study by the
British government found that Linux users need to upgrade their hardware
only half as often as Windows users. 
</p></li><li><p>
Investigate the environmental footprint of your next equipment purchase
with Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT).
</p></li><li><p>
Look for the Energy Star logo, with its tough new requirements, for energy
efficiency and power management capabilities.
</p></li><li><p>
Recycle your old CRT monitor&mdash;according to ViewSonic, a 19" LCD monitor
sips only 40 Watts compared to 100 Watts for a comparable CRT monitor. The
company estimates you'll save around $20 annually in electricity costs. 
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x165e580.0x1b51140"></a>
Do It with Linux</h2></div></div><p>
Although most news about the environment and energy consumption is alarming,
the plethora of new Linux-focused technologies and initiatives related to
green computing is a cause for hope and optimism. Many barriers,
such as data-center complexity, lack of information and societal apathy,
must yet be overcome, but the Linux community and many IT firms have laid a
laudable foundation from which to build. The initiatives outlined in this
article&mdash;IBM's Big Green Linux, Intel's Lesswatts.org, Linus' tickless
kernel, virtualization, Zonbu and Koolu PCs, Energy Star, EPEAT and
more&mdash;are excellent tools that can help you to do well while you do good. 
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> encourages you to keep Mother Nature in
mind as you green up
your data center or PC, but if you do your homework, going green likely
will not be a burden to bear but a substantial long-term competitive
cost advantage as well.
