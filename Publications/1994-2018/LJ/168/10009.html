How do we turn a Google Gadget into an OpenSocial application? An
initial look at the OpenSocial API&mdash;what it includes, as well as what
it doesn't.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1980580.0x1a78358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The past year has seen an explosion in the growth of social-networking
sites like Facebook. People have jumped at the opportunity to find
existing friends, make new ones and spend time communicating and
participating in group activities on-line. Facebook might be the
best-known site, but LinkedIn, Ning, Hi5, Orkut and others also
have become popular.
</p><p>
As we might expect in a competitive marketplace, each of these sites
has tried to offer unique features to encourage new people to sign
up. During the summer of 2007, Facebook unveiled one of the most
interesting and powerful of these features in its developer platform&mdash;basically, a way to integrate third-party Web applications into
Facebook.
</p><p>
This API has led to a torrent of applications being developed for
Facebook. It's not clear whether anyone is making money off these
applications or whether there are any that people find truly useful (rather
than frivolous). But, there are plenty of indications that Facebook's
API is an important milestone for social-networking applications and
for Web applications in general. For the first time, we have a Web
site that is providing an open platform for application development.
</p><p>
In response to the popularity of Facebook's developer API, a number of
competitors announced they would be supporting a similar API,
known as OpenSocial. Applications written for OpenSocial should work
equally well on all compliant social networks. Thus, instead of
writing one application for MySpace and another for Ning, you can
write the application once and deploy it on many different networks.
The exception, at least for now, is Facebook; whether Facebook decides
to join the OpenSocial consortium or provide a compatibility
layer remains to be seen.
</p><p>
The OpenSocial specification was spearheaded by Google and is based
on the specification known as Google Gadgets, part of the
personalized iGoogle page for some time. Last month, we looked at how
to build a simple Google Gadget, which packages HTML and JavaScript
into an XML wrapper.
</p><p>
This month, we look at how to take our simple Google Gadget and
turn it into an OpenSocial-compliant application. We begin to
see the pros and cons of the OpenSocial standard and consider ways
to make use of its capabilities.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1980580.0x1a78720"></a>
Making the Gadget Social</h2></div></div><p>
As we saw last month, the simplest possible &ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo; Google
Gadget looks like the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?&gt;
&lt;Module&gt;
  &lt;ModulePrefs title="Hello world" /&gt;
  &lt;Content type="html"&gt;
     &lt;![CDATA[
       Hello, world!
     ]]&gt;

  &lt;/Content&gt;
&lt;/Module&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
The gadget comes as an XML file, with a Module section and a
Content section. The Module section allows us to specify
gadget-specific preferences, using the ModulePrefs tag. The Content
section, as you might expect, contains the HTML and JavaScript that
will be displayed and executed for the user.
</p><p>
We can turn a simple gadget into an OpenSocial gadget by adding a new
Require tag within our Module tag:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?&gt;
&lt;Module&gt;
    &lt;ModulePrefs title="Hello world" /&gt;
    &lt;Require feature="opensocial-0.6" /&gt;
    &lt;Content type="html"&gt;
        &lt;![CDATA[
         Hello, world!
        ]]&gt;
    &lt;/Content&gt;
&lt;/Module&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
The Require tag indicates that our gadget is implementing the
OpenSocial standard, version 0.6. (A new version undoubtedly will be
released by the time this column is printed. The initial version,
0.5, was superseded by 0.6 in late December 2007.) Other than that
single line, this is the same &ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo; widget we installed
on our iGoogle page last month. In theory, we can go ahead and
install this application on the social-networking site (OpenSocial
container) of our choice, and it'll work just fine.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1980580.0x1a78a90"></a>
Adding Social Functionality</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo; is boring enough as a standalone program; using it as
an example of a social-networking API seems almost silly. For a
gadget to become a fully fledged OpenSocial application, it needs to
demonstrate an ability to interact with other people. More precisely,
a socially aware application should be able to find out something
about me and my friends, as well as what I (and my friends) do.
</p><p>
The OpenSocial API addresses this by offering three types of functionality:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
People and relationships: get information about you, your
friends and the various pieces of data associated with those
friends. The Person class provides access to this
information.
</p></li><li><p>
Activities: social-networking sites are interesting because
they let you interact with your friends in a variety of
activities. These activities can range from exchanging
messages to answering questions in an on-line poll to keeping
up to date on the latest sports scores. OpenSocial sees an
activity as a collection of actions within a particular
container. The Activity class provides access to this data.
</p></li><li><p>
Persistence: OpenSocial makes it possible for an application to
store information between sessions. One of the most interesting
aspects of this persistence API is the fact that storage is
handled by the OpenSocial container, not by the application.
There is no Persistence class for handling such data. Rather,
the data is read and written by invoking methods on the overall
opensocial object. Note that the persistence layer lets
applications store data globally, as well as on a per-user or
per-application instance basis, as needed.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Interactions with these three objects, as well as with the OpenSocial
API in general, is done via method calls on the opensocial object.
Typically, methods execute asynchronously, with a callback method
specified as one of the invocation parameters. For example, we can
get information about the person currently running (viewing) our
application by creating a new OpenSocial data request and indicating
what request we want to make:

<pre     class="programlisting">
var req = opensocial.newDataRequest();

req.add(req.newFetchPersonRequest(opensocial.DataRequest.
&#8618;PersonId.VIEWER),"viewer");
</pre>
</p><p>
We then send the request to our container:

<pre     class="programlisting">
req.send(response);
</pre>
</p><p>
The response parameter is a function; as soon as the request returns
a response, that function will be invoked. Moreover, when the
response function is invoked, it will be passed a single parameter
that contains the results from our method call.
</p><p>
We can send multiple queries within a single data-request object; all
we have to do is invoke req.add multiple times. As you can see from
the above line of code, invoking req.newFetchPersonRequest required
that we both indicate what we want to request, and that we give it a
symbolic name (viewer). This naming allows us to pull apart
different types of response data within a single object.
</p><p>
You might be wondering what stops the viewer from being able to
retrieve arbitrary data from the OpenSocial container. The answer is
that OpenSocial defines two basic types of people: the viewer and
the owner. The former, as we have seen, refers to the person who is
running and viewing the operation&mdash;and might even refer to no one at
all, if our system permits anonymous browsing. The owner, by
contrast, must be a defined person on the system, and may very well
refer to the same person as the viewer. But at least in theory,
OpenSocial will provide only limited information to viewers about
owners with whom they have no relationship.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1980580.0x1a79170"></a>
Who Are Your Friends?</h2></div></div><p>
Perhaps the simplest type of application we can write with
OpenSocial is one that shows the current user's friends. Better yet,
because friends on a social-networking site typically upload their
pictures, we even can display a list of the viewer's friends.
</p><p>
Last month, we saw how we can modify the HTML in which a Google
Gadget&mdash;or an OpenSocial application&mdash;is running. Create an empty div,
build up the HTML in a variable, and then set the div's innerHTML
property to be that of the variable. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

html = "&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;";
div.innerHTML = html;

</pre>
</p><p>
In order to display a list of the viewer's friends, we need to
retrieve a list of those friends. We then can iterate over those
friends, putting their thumbnail image URL in our html variable.
</p><p>
In order to retrieve a list of friends, we must do the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
viewer_friends = opensocial.DataRequest.Group.VIEWER_FRIENDS;
req.add(req.newFetchPeopleRequest(viewer_friends, opt_params),
&#8618;"viewer_friends");
req.send(response);
</pre>
</p><p>
The above request contains a single query, which we call
viewer_friends. (Don't be confused by the viewer_friends variable,
which was introduced simply to make the lines easier to understand.)
</p><p>
When the method has finished executing asynchronously, it invokes our
response function. We can define it like any other JavaScript
function, and Google's documentation even indicates that you can use
JavaScript libraries, such as Prototype or Dojo, inside an OpenSocial
application.
</p><p>
Google already has included a number of useful JavaScript functions as
part of its implementation of gadgets, meaning that a Ruby-like each
method is available to us. That method, which typically is invoked on
an array, takes a function as a parameter. The function is executed
once for each element of the array, with each array element being
passed to the function in turn. Thus, we can write our response method
as follows:


<pre     class="programlisting">

function response(data) {
    var viewer_friends = data.get("viewer_friends").getData();
    viewer_friends.each(function(person) {
        var thumb =
person.getField(opensocial.Person.Field.THUMBNAIL_URL);
        html += '&lt;img src="' + thumb + '"/&gt;';
        });

    document.getElementById('main').innerHTML = html;
}

</pre>
</p><p>
Our response method is invoked only after the request has been sent.
Its data parameter is populated with the response to our query,
which we can retrieve with its name (viewer_friends). We then use
the getData() method on the resulting object to give us the data that
interests us, namely an array of person objects.
</p><p>
Each person in OpenSocial has a few required properties, among them
the URL of their personal thumbnail picture. You can see from
the above example that we retrieve it by invoking the getField()
method on a person, indicating which field we want by using a value
provided by the OpenSocial framework. We can use several such values, including ID (for their unique ID), NAME (for their
name) and even PROFILE_URL (for the person's home page URL on the
system). Beyond those basic fields, a well-behaved OpenSocial
application must query its container to make sure that it's 
available.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1980580.0x1a79698"></a>
Does OpenSocial Work?</h2></div></div><p>
One of the biggest problems with OpenSocial is its inherent diversity
and cross-platform functionality. Programmers who create desktop
applications have discovered&mdash;often the hard way&mdash;that different
operating systems have different conventions for how dialog boxes, or
even menus, look and feel. These often-subtle design distinctions can
play a major role in the usability of an application.
</p><p>
Thus, it'll be interesting to see what happens when OpenSocial
applications are unveiled and are supposed to work cleanly on all
systems. One of the Facebook platform's great advantages is the fact
that it shoehorns application content into a standard look and feel.
This is missing with OpenSocial, and although it encourages diversity,
I'm far from convinced this will be good for end users.
</p><p>
Another, and more serious, issue with OpenSocial is that it
is designed to let applications run in different contexts, not 
seamlessly join data from diverse social-networking systems. Yes,
it's nice that software developers will be able to release their code
on multiple platforms at the same time. But as a user as well as a
developer, I'm interested in getting a comprehensive list of all my
friends/contacts/links from all the social networks to which I
belong.
</p><p>
Just a few weeks before I wrote these words, well-known blogger Robert
Scoble was kicked off Facebook for downloading his contact list
into another program. (His account was reinstated within a few days.)
The notion that data should stay locked within one of these systems,
rather than be freely downloadable and transferable by the people who
entered and approved it, is disappointing.
</p><p>
If I create a forum application using OpenSocial, and I use the
persistence API in order to store messages, it might work just fine.
But, what if I want the forum to work across different networks, such
that forum postings are persistent not only across users, but also across
the different OpenSocial containers? That appears to be completely
unsupported by the standard. And although such capabilities would seem
to be against the interests of the various social-networking
companies, it is most certainly in the interest of the individual
users.
</p><p>
Of course, given that OpenSocial is nothing more than a specification
and set of JavaScript libraries, there's still hope. Perhaps someone
will create a JavaScript library that allows OpenSocial client
applications to store and retrieve state on a remote server (that is, not
on the OpenSocial container's server) in a format that can be
unpacked and used across systems easily. Such a library might be difficult
to create, particularly given the various user-visibility and privacy
issues. But, it would be an additional step toward not just code
portability, but data portability, that many people would like to see
in OpenSocial.
</p><p>
I should note that I'm not the first or only person to raise some of
these concerns. Tim O'Reilly, among others, has expressed his
disappointment with the initial versions of OpenSocial (see Resources).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1980580.0x1a79a08"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
OpenSocial provides a standard library and packaging system for
applications that fit into a social-networking site. Assuming that
enough sites implement the OpenSocial specification, this will greatly
ease the burden from developers, who still will have to develop for
Facebook.
</p><p>
This month, we took a short look at what the OpenSocial standard
offers developers and how we can create applications that take
advantage of these supports. We also saw how OpenSocial applications
communicate with the enclosing containers. Finally, we saw how we can
even create a simple application in only a few lines of carefully
chosen code.
</p><p>
It remains to be seen whether OpenSocial will succeed, either on its
own or as a competitor to the Facebook development platform. I do
believe that it needs to become more mature before it will be truly
useful. But, the intentions are definitely positive, and there is a great
deal of potential for good to come out of this standard.
