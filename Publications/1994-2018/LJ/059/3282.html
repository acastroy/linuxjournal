    Linux drives the experimental vehicle of the University of
    Parma.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a36580.0x1b2ea80"></a></h2></div></div><p>The goal of the ARGO Project is to
develop active safety systems for vehicles of the future. These
systems are able to understand the environmental conditions and, in
case of sudden danger, they can warn the driver or even take
control of the vehicle. Furthermore, these systems have the
capability to fully drive the vehicle without human intervention
(Automatic Driving).
</p><p><a href="3282f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. The
ARGO Prototype Vehicle</b></span></a></p><p>ARGO (see Figure 1), the prototype vehicle developed at the
Universit&agrave; di Parma, Italy, was demonstrated to the public
and the scientific community in June 1998, when it drove
autonomously for more than 2000km on the Italian highway
network.</p><p>The entire real-time data acquisition and processing is
performed on a single Pentium MMX-based PC running Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a36580.0x1b2ed40"></a>Motivation</h2></div></div><p>A large number of problems (not just those related to traffic
and safety) could be solved by using automatically driven
vehicles.</p><p>Beside the obvious advantages of increasing safety and
reducing road accidents, thereby saving lives, the possibility of
having vehicles moving in much closer proximity than they do today
would produce an increase in road capacity. A more intelligent
modulation of each vehicle's speed would also result in an
appreciable reduction in fuel consumption. In other words,
automatic vehicle driving has the potential to achieve optimal use
of current transportation infrastructures, improve mobility and
minimize risks, travel times and energy consumption. Moreover,
commercial and industrial vehicles which repeatedly move along a
given path would benefit from a stronger control of their routes
and would require fewer personnel to manage their moves.</p><p>Unfortunately, an automatic vehicle, more than in other
applications, needs real-time response, thus requiring smart
algorithms and powerful computing engines. At the same time, as far
as a commercial product is concerned, the cost of the system must
be kept low. Initially, the underlying technology, such as head-up
displays, infrared cameras, radars and sonars are derived from
expensive military applications. Thanks to increased interest in
these applications and the progress of industrial production,
today's technology offers sensors, processing systems and output
devices at very competitive prices.</p><p>This project shows how a very low-cost solution (regarding
both sensors and processing engines) was successfully adapted to
drive an &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; vehicle in real-world conditions. This
article describes the underlying architecture, which is based on a
standard Pentium MMX 200 MHz and the Linux operating system, and
discusses the main advantages and problems encountered during the
whole project.</p><p>The project was founded by the Italian National Research
Council (CNR), and the MilleMiglia in Automatico tour was sponsored
by TIM, Telecom Italia Mobile, which provided GSM apparatus and
cellular connectivity throughout the whole journey.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a36580.0x1b2efa8"></a>System Architecture</h2></div></div><p>The heart of the computing architecture installed on ARGO
(shown in Figures 2 and 3) is based on a single Pentium MMX
processor (200MHz, 32MB of RAM). The PC was equipped with some
additional boards for image acquisition, image visualization,
acoustic warnings and data I/O from specific devices.</p><p><a href="3282f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
Internal View of the ARGO Vehicle</b></span></a></p><p><a href="3282f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3. The
Computing Architecture and Equipment</b></span></a></p><p>GOLD (Generic Obstacle and Lane Detection), the software that
drives the ARGO vehicle, has been designed to be as portable as
possible; therefore, it is independent of specific Linux
distributions/libraries and can be compiled against either libc or
glibc. Moreover, because of the high stability of the first kernel
(2.0.18) we installed, the current distribution used on ARGO is
still a Debian 1.2.</p><p>The following is a description of the ARGO adapters/software
libraries as well as their support for Linux.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Acquisition device</b></span>: since
ARGO relies on a vision-based processing engine, the acquisition
device is the most important piece of hardware. GOLD needs a frame
grabber capable of simultaneously grabbing two grey-level images
from two different cameras. Thanks to the availability of specific
mailing lists about Linux and Vision
(http://atlantek.com.au/USERS/wes/linux/frame.html), we discovered
that only the Matrox Meteor RGB frame grabber had this feature
among the Linux-supported hardware. The Matrox Meteor module is not
yet video4linux compliant. Nevertheless, the availability of many
examples as well as their source code permitted us to rapidly
interact with this hardware.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Data I/O</b></span>: while the frame
grabber could be devised as the main input device, autonomous
driving also requires an output device for maneuvering the steering
wheel. A National Instruments LabPC+ ISA adapter has been installed
in the ARGO PC; it provides a number of multi-functional analog,
digital and timing I/O ports. Therefore, it is used for driving the
steering wheel actuator (a stepping motor), determining the
vehicle's speed (through a Hall-effect speedometer) and inputting
user commands from the control panel as in Figure 2. The LabPC+
usage is quite simple, since the Linux module supplies a device and
simple ioctls for each different I/O port.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Acoustic warnings</b></span>:
acoustical warnings are fed to the driver. A simple interface for a
standard sound card has been developed using the OSS free sound
module.</p><p><a href="3282f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4. A
Screenshot of the Output from the Onboard
Monitor</b></span></a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Image visualization</b></span>: the
result of the computation is also fed to passengers through a color
6-inch monitor installed onboard the ARGO vehicle (see Figure 4).
Development of the software requires the capability to both inspect
intermediate results and input debug commands. For these purposes,
two interfaces have been developed, one VGA-based and one
X11-based. In the first case, the SVGA library is used for showing
the (intermediate) results and the ncurses library is used to input
user commands. In the second case, the xform widget library is also
used (see Figure 5).</p><p><a href="3282f5.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 5. The
X11-based Control Panel</b></span></a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Programming facilities</b></span>: the
MMX capabilities of the Pentium processor were exploited in order
to boost processing speed. A few portions of the GOLD code were
directly rewritten using MMX assembly language and compiled using
the Netwide Assembler (NASM), a general-purpose x86 assembler that
supports Pentium, P6 and MMX opcodes.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Internet connection</b></span>: during
the vehicle's demonstrations, live video shots of the driving cabin
are broadcast to the Internet. To accomplish this, a link to the
Internet was established. This type of link implies the use of
mobile telecommunications facilities, such as GSM or satellite
modems and places the following constraints:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>low bit-rate band for transmission (usually a
little more than one kilobyte/second)</p></li><li><p>high variability of the bandwidth during
movements</p></li><li><p>frequent carrier losses</p></li></ul></div><p>In order to increase the link's throughput, two GSM modems
are used simultaneously. In fact, the Linux kernel provides a
specific method of making multiple serial links behave as a single
faster connection: the EQualize Load balancer (EQL). The underlying
idea is to split network traffic across the serial lines. In
addition, the EQL also supports links that feature different
throughputs and protocols.
</p><p>In order to not excessively burden the main processing
engine, another cheap Linux box (a Compaq laptop) was installed on
the vehicle and was equipped with a parallel port Quickcam Color
camera (supported by Linux) and two GSM modems able to work up to
9600Kbps using the MNP10-EC protocol. A custom application is used
to grab images from the Quickcam, convert them to the JPEG format
and send them to our web server at http://MilleMiglia.ce.unipr.it/
(a third Linux machine) through the two GSM modems exploiting EQL.
As soon as these images are received, a graphical timestamp is
superimposed onto their lower portion and they are made available
on the Internet. A simple script running continuously in the
background is used to restore the two connections if, for any
reason (tunnels, GSM uncovered areas, etc.), they are lost.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a36580.0x1b2fcb8"></a>On Road Test Journey</h2></div></div><p>In order to test the vehicle extensively under different
traffic conditions, road environments and weather, a 2000km journey
was undertaken June 1 through June 6, 1998. During this test, ARGO
drove autonomously along the Italian highway network, passing
through flat areas and hilly regions including viaducts and
tunnels. The Italian road network is particularly suited for such
an extensive test since it is characterized by quickly varying road
scenarios, changing weather conditions and generally a fair amount
of traffic. The tour took place on highways and freeways, but the
system also proved to work on sufficiently structured rural roads
with no intersections.</p><p>During the journey, in addition to the normal tasks of data
acquisition and processing for automatic driving, the system logged
the most significant data, such as speed, position of the steering
wheel, lane changes, user interventions and commands, dumping the
whole status of the system (images included) whenever the system
had difficulties in detecting the road lane reliably.</p><p>This data was processed off-line after the end of the tour in
order to compute the overall system performance, such as the
percentage of automatic driving, and to analyze unexpected
situations. The possibility of reprocessing the same images,
starting from a given system status, allows the reproduction of
conditions in which a fault was detected and a way of solving it
found. At the end of the tour, the system log contained more than
1200MB of raw data, while during the whole tour the system
processed about 1,500,000 images (each 768 x 288 pixels) totalling
about 330GB of input data.</p><p>During the tour, the ARGO vehicle broadcast a live video
stream to the Internet: two GSM cellular modems were connected to
the Vision Laboratory of the Dipartimento di Ingegneria
dell'Informazione in Parma, and were used to transfer both
up-to-date news on the test's progression and images acquired by a
camera installed in the driving cabin to demonstrate automatic
driving. Proving there was high interest in the scientific
community, mass media and general public, the web site
http://MilleMiglia.CE.UniPR.IT/ was visited more than 350,000 times
during the tour and more than 3000MB of information was
transferred, with a peak of 16,000 visits per hour during the first
day of the tour.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a36580.0x1b26758"></a>Performance Analysis</h2></div></div><p>The main problem experienced during the tour was due to image
acquisition. One aim of the project is the development of a
sufficiently low-cost system that will ease its integration into a
large number of vehicles, so the use of low-cost acquisition
devices was a clear starting point. In particular, videophone
cameras (small-sized sensors at an average cost of $100 US each)
were installed. Although these cameras have a high sensitivity even
in low-light conditions (at night), a sudden change in illumination
of the scene (for example, at the entrance or exit from a tunnel)
causes a degradation in the image quality. (They were designed for
applications characterized by constant illumination, such as
video-telephony.) The cameras have a slow automatic gain control to
the exit from a tunnel for a period of about 100 to 200ms; thus,
the acquired images are completely saturated and their analysis
becomes impossible.</p><p><a href="3282f6.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 6.
Automatic Driving During the MilleMiglia in Automatico
Tour</b></span></a></p><p>On the other hand, the design of the processing system proved
to be appropriate for automatic driving of the vehicle. Moreover,
current technology provides processing systems with characteristics
that are definitely more powerful than the one installed on ARGO: a
commercial PC with a 200MHz Pentium processor and 32MB of memory.
On such a system, enhanced by a video frame grabber able to acquire
two stereo images simultaneously (with 768x576 pixel resolution),
the GOLD system processes up to 25 pairs of stereo frames per
second and provides the control signals for autonomous steering
every 40ms. (This is equivalent to one refinement on the steering
wheel position for every meter when the vehicle is driving at
100kmph.) Obviously, the processing speed influences the maximum
safe vehicle speed: the higher the processing speed, the higher the
maximum vehicle speed.</p><p>Differing weather conditions in particular light conditions
demonstrated the robustness of both the approach and the image
processing algorithms. In fact, the system was always able to
extract the information for the navigation task even in critical
light conditions, with the sun in front of the cameras, high or low
on the horizon, during the evening as well as during the day, with
high or low contrast. At night, the system's behavior is improved
by the absence of sunlight reflections and shadows, while the area
of interest is constantly illuminated by the vehicle
headlights.</p><p><a href="3282f7.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 7. The
MilleMiglia in Automatico Tour Route</b></span></a></p><p>Finally, the system proved to be surprisingly robust despite
high temperatures measured during the tour. In some cases, the
external temperature reached 35 degrees Celsius and the system
continued to work reliably even with no air conditioning.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a36580.0x1b26b78"></a>Statistical Analysis of the Tour</h2></div></div><p><a href="3282t1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Table 1. System
Performance Statistics</b></span></a></p><p>The analysis of the data collected during the tour allowed
the computation of a number of statistics regarding system
performance (see Table 1). In particular, for each stage of the
tour, the average and maximum speeds of the vehicle during
automatic driving were computed. Average speed was strongly
influenced by the heavy traffic conditions (especially on Torino,
Milano and Roma's bypasses) and by the presence of toll stations,
junctions and road works.</p><p>The automatic driving percentage and maximum distance show
high values, despite the presence of many tunnels (particularly
during the Appennines routes Ancona to Roma and Firenze to Bologna)
and of several stretches of road with absent or worn lane markings
(Ferrara to Ancona and Ancona to Roma) or even no lane markings at
all (Firenze to Bologna). It is fundamentally important to note
that some stages included passing through toll stations and
transiting bypasses with heavy traffic and frequent queues, during
which the system had to be switched off.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a36580.0x1b26de0"></a>Closing Remarks</h2></div></div><p>Throughout the entire project, the choice of an Intel-based
platform, coupled with the Linux operating system, was shown to be
extremely reliable; the number of faults due to these system
components was zero over the last two years.</p><p>Originally, the main reason behind the choice of the Linux
operating system (instead of real-time OS or operating systems for
industrial PCs) was the availability of up-to-date developing and
debugging tools, drivers and FAQs about specific hardware devices,
and the possibility of interacting with a large number of
researchers worldwide on the Internet in order to solve
problems.</p><p>The main topics for future research (ARGO Project, phase II)
are related to the development of a new vehicle integrating both
road following and platooning (the automatic following of a
manually driven vehicle) functionalities. In this next phase, the
processing engine will be a higher performance Intel-based
architecture, again driven by the Linux operating system.</p><p><a href="3282s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="3282s2.html" target="_self">Comments From Others about
