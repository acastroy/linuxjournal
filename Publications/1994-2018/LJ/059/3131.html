Bethesda, Maryland, a cozy suburb of Washington, D.C. On the
surface, Whitman looks like any other school. However, if you look
to your right upon entering the building, you will see something
rarely seen in our schools: a neat row of terminals, each
displaying the message shown in <a href="3131l1.html" target="_self">Listing
1</a>. What is unique about this login screen is that the
server it comes from is entirely student operated and maintained.
The story behind it is as unique as the situation.
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3131f1.jpg"></div>
</p><p>In 1994, the students at Walt Whitman High School were told
they were on the very bottom of the list to become part of
Montgomery County Public Schools' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Global
Access</em></span> program. Global Access is an initiative to give
all of MCPS state-of-the-art computers and high-speed Internet
connections. Having moved into a brand-new building just two years
before, Whitman was given low priority for the technology upgrades.
However, the community did not stand idly by and allow their school
to become a technological backwater. With community support, the
school purchased three Power Macintosh computers which are now used
for multimedia presentations and a few Windows 95 machines for the
WWHS Media Center. These computers were put in a storage room off
the Media Center, creating the &ldquo;Tech Team&rdquo; where students could
use the few available advanced computers for projects and research.
However, some students had an even more revolutionary idea: use
Linux to provide e-mail accounts and text-based Internet access to
everyone in the school.</p><p>George Mason University's Center for the New Engineer had a
grant to provide several schools in the Washington, D.C. metro area
with ISDN links to their four T1 lines. Walt Whitman was chosen as
one of the schools. The school already had a donated Compaq
Proliant server with the following specifications:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Intel Pentium 100 processor</p></li><li><p>48MB of RAM</p></li><li><p>4.2GB of disk space with Compaq's HotPlug
system</p></li><li><p>DigiBoard IMAC ISDN router</p></li><li><p>Lucent/Livingston PortMaster 2e</p></li></ul></div><p>Although the machine originally had Novell Netware 4.1
installed, the Tech Team decided to use Linux as the server's
operating system. The original system administrator, Gerald
Britton, spent hours setting up the server and adding accounts for
1500 students and staff. The server now has over 2000 users and
handles a large volume of mail. It is maintained by a team of five
students and hosts the school's web site (http://whitman.gmu.edu/)
which receives several thousand hits a week. The web site is used
for such things as school announcements, contests and even homework
postings by teachers.
</p><p>Five years later, Whitman students still use the server for
research projects, to keep in touch with mentors, friends and
family, and to communicate with people all over the world. To
facilitate easy use of the server, the Tech Team installed a menu
system for students and staff to use so they don't have to explore
the innards of Linux unless they truly want to. However, many
students elect to use a conventional shell and have learned
real-world UNIX skills on the server.</p><p>Whitman has a one-channel ISDN line to George Mason
University which connects their entire school network to the
Internet pending the arrival of Global Access. However, the arrival
of county support may not be good news for the Tech Team. The
county has not given the Tech Team permission to run their server
on the Global Access network. Therefore, the Tech Team is currently
searching for an Internet service provider to donate bandwidth so
they can continue their student-run Internet services. Their system
now boasts a Livingston PortMaster 2e and 25 USR modems attached to
phone lines throughout the school, with which the Tech Team is
experimenting with plans to allow students to dial in and check
their e-mail from home at night. Walt Whitman is one of a few
public schools using Linux and currently one of two schools in
Montgomery County which provides e-mail to all its students. The
other school plays host to a Computer Science magnet program that
only recently has opened its system to the whole school. MCPS has
an e-mail system called FirstClass that students can use. However,
students applying for an account must first find a staff sponsor
before they can submit their application. Whitman requires only
that the student and the student's parents sign a contract
promising that the student will not misuse the system. Despite
fears that students would use their accounts for non-educational
purposes, they understand their access is a privilege and each one
of them has a responsibility to safeguard it for the school.</p><p>With the Internet becoming more of a research tool than a toy
in schools today, it is important that all students have equal
access to services like e-mail. Whitman has tried to level the
playing field a bit and allow all of its students to have the same
opportunity to communicate and share ideas. Whitman's system
administrators hope they can find enough resources to continue the
service. Whitman's use of Linux is only a small part of the
picture. The focus of their efforts isn't just to promote Linux in
schools, but to provide the rest of the school with a valuable
learning experience that shows the Internet to be a useful tool in
the real world.</p><p>At the time I originally wrote this article, Whitman's
connection was in the process of being severed. The Tech Team
submitted proposals to local corporations in the hope that they
could receive enough funding to continue the service. Now, Whitman
has received a grant from Science Applications International
Corporation (http://www.saic.com/) and Bethesda Online Organization
(http://www.boo.net/) that will allow it to continue its Internet
access for another year.</p></div></div>
