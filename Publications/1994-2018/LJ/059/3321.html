    TkZip, tkWorld, tknotepad and more.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ce1580.0x1dd9450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Since the debut of this column, I have
received several e-mails with suggestions for software packages to
review. Last month, I looked at a few packages built with GTK+.
While these still seem to be the large majority of start-up
packages, ones written in other languages are also available. I
will highlight one or two that use Tcl/Tk. It is also true that not
all the good programs are graphical.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ce1580.0x1dd9558"></a>TkZip:http://www.pcnet.com/~proteus/TkZip/TkZip.html</h2></div></div><p>TkZip is a very well done program that can handle just about
any compression utility available on Linux, including tar, bzip,
bzip2, gzip, compress, cpio, zip and more. It will search your
system for the utilities it needs. The interface is intuitive and
aesthetically pleasing. If you are uncomfortable with archiving or
compression utilities, either creating or extracting them, this
program should be high on your list of &ldquo;must haves&rdquo;. It requires
Tcl/Tk 4.2 or higher.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ce1580.0x1dd9660"></a>tkWorld:http://www.tkworld.org/</h2></div></div><p>I have looked at several very nice GTK utilities, such as
<span   class="bold"><b>gtkfind</b></span>, that did an excellent job
and were intuitive to use. The one shortcoming I noted was that the
command which actually does the work could not be captured. tkWorld
allows you to see the command line and capture it for use in a
script, as well as see the results in a window. tkWorld also allows
you to create complex &ldquo;scripts&rdquo; by selecting a pipe and
continuing with other commands. Currently, you can pipe
<span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span> through
<span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span>. While I don't consider the
interface quite as appealing as the interface in gtkfind, this
program shows a good deal of promise, particularly when the
&ldquo;Registry&rdquo;, the list of utilities tkWorld recognizes, is better
filled out. It requires Tcl/Tk 8.0.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ce1580.0x1dd9870"></a>tknotepad:ftp://ftp.mindspring.com/users/joeja/</h2></div></div><p>Just migrated from Windows to Linux? Still use Windows and
its note pad? Well, <span   class="bold"><b>tknotepad</b></span> will
have you feeling at home. Apart from the grey background, it looks
and feels exactly like the note pad from Windows, complete with a
selection for turning &ldquo;Word Wrap&rdquo; on or off. This gives all those
who fear vi, but don't want the complexity of Emacs, reason to
rejoice. It requires Tcl/Tk 8.0.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ce1580.0x1dd99d0"></a>dut:dkampman@xs4all.nl</h2></div></div><p>The premise for <span   class="bold"><b>dut</b></span> is that
novice users should not be confronted with a command line while in
a GUI. Buttons present the user with choices for selecting the file
to work with, highlighting the file and editing it, removing,
executing, etc. Not all buttons are functional at this time.
According to the author, the goal is eventually to be able to
replace an xterm for those doing rather vanilla things like
creating, editing and executing files. The only problem I
encountered was the same one most new users who don't read English
encounter: I was not always sure what the button was supposed to
do. A good initiative to keep the Linux momentum alive would be to
allow users to set a language preference so that buttons, boxes and
dialogs would be understandable to them. It requires libc5,
xforms-0.88, X11 and libm.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ce1580.0x1dd9b30"></a>compjuga:http://csg.uwaterloo.ca/~dmg/compjuga/</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>compjuga</b></span> provides a complete
conjugation of whatever Spanish verb you specify. Currently, it is
a command-line-only program. Writing a GUI wrapper should be
trivial, although I don't know if the author is considering that as
an option. A good compromise would be a GUI interface if the
DISPLAY environment variable is set, otherwise output as it does
now. The author does promise a move away from gdbm. It requires
glibc and gdbm.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ce1580.0x1dd9c90"></a>GNU Pilot LogBook
Pro:ftp://ftp.stampede.org/skibum/</h2></div></div><p>Pilot LogBook is a full-feature, functional log book for
aircraft pilots. Just about any field you might need is here. You
can view totals and make notes. One area that has not yet been
implemented, but is planned (if you believe in labeled buttons), is
Medical Info. For me, not much is missing. I would prefer the
totals included categories for 90 days and six months back, common
FAR prerequisites for certain flights. The database is a flat-file
database; I would have preferred MySQL. It requires GTK-1.0.6,
Xext, X11, libm and glibc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ce1580.0x1dd9d98"></a>EReminders:ftp://allie.alliedtours.com/pub/EReminder/</h2></div></div><p>I tend to stay quite busy, but even when on the road I check
my e-mail. EReminder has a lot of promise for those who need polite
reminders by e-mail. Now, instead of remembering to e-mail myself a
note, especially if it is a recurring requirement, I can let my
system do it for me. This is a first release and a little rough, at
least in the security area. The author has not yet taken advantage
of MySQL's ability to encrypt passwords, so they are stored as
plaintext. It requires MySQL, Apache with the php3 module compiled
with MySQL, cron and a mail transport agent.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ce1580.0x1dd9ea0"></a>sxid:ftp://marcus.seva.net/pub/sxid/</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>sxid</b></span> is great for system
administrators who want to monitor the status of
<span   class="bold"><b>suid</b></span>/<span   class="bold"><b>sgid</b></span>
programs. It can be run from cron and the results mailed to anyone
who needs the information. Another great security tool to
compliment <span   class="bold"><b>tripwire</b></span> and others. It
requires glibc; cron and a mail transport agent are
optional.</p><p>That's it for now, even though many more good packages are
available on the Web.</p></div></div>
