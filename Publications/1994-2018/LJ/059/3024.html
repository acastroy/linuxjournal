    An overview of two applications for spacecraft and why these
    applications are being run on Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb46580.0xc3e348"></a></h2></div></div><p>The first element of the International
Space Station (ISS) has already been launched from Baikonur,
Russia. ISS is the biggest civilian endeavor ever entrusted to
human science and technology. Thousands of software code lines are
being, and will be, written for the station, on-ground and
on-board. ISS represents a synergy among many space agencies and
companies around the globe, including European Space Agency (ESA).
ESA has been developing several prototype systems which will pave
the technology road for the European contributions to the ISS
program. Among others, ESA has chosen Linux as the operating system
for two software products which will control the rendezvous and
docking operations for a servicing spacecraft called ATV. This
article presents an overview of these products, explaining why they
run on Linux, the advantages and disadvantages of doing so and the
future of Linux in the space industry.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb46580.0xc3e450"></a>The Automatic Transfer Vehicle</h2></div></div><p>The ESA Automatic Transfer Vehicle (ATV) is an unmanned
spacecraft planned to perform regular re-boosting and re-fueling of
the International Space Station. Other ATV missions will comprise
payload supply and payload removal from the ISS. The ATV is an
ongoing project approved in October 1995 by the Council of the
European Space Agency. ATV is scheduled to be launched for the
first time by an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guyana in
February 2003.</p><p><a href="3024f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. ATV
Spacecraft</b></span></a></p><p>In its early configuration, ATV was designed as a cylindrical
shaped spacecraft containing a cargo module (pressurized or
unpressurized), a docking port and a propulsion module. Lately, ATV
was modified with four solar panels added (see Figure 1).</p><p>The ATV mission profile establishes docking with the ISS in
the Russian segment of the station. Rendezvous operations start at
about 20km behind the station. This means that ATV will fly behind
and faster than ISS, in order to catch up to the docking port of
the station. The problem of the space rendezvous is the mating of
two spacecraft in orbit&mdash;a small active chaser spacecraft (ATV) and
a big target (ISS).</p><p>Although spacecraft rendezvous and docking may look simple,
they are not. The mathematical equations governing the relative
movement between chaser and target are rather complex. The onboard
control of the rendezvous operations is to a large extent
automatic, but not fully autonomous. Some control tasks are done
from the ground control center and others onboard the station.
Although the ATV onboard computer is fault tolerant, the complexity
of the mission does not allow the prevention of and recovery all
possible types of mission failures. Special features of the onboard
system would allow detecting and forecasting failures, isolating
them and proposing and executing recovery actions, but only for
those types of contingencies anticipated during system design. The
failure detection and recovery features are linked to both mission
safety and mission success.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb46580.0xc3e768"></a>Linux to the Rescue</h2></div></div><p>To overcome these and other issues, ESA built two products:
GOAS and RACSI. GOAS is the Ground Operator Assistant System for
the rendezvous operations of ATV. Used on ground, GOAS is a
software tool to monitor the ATV mission and intervene in case of a
problem. GOAS provides complex command and control capabilities to
replan the entire mission if necessary. RACSI is the remote ATV
control at ISS. RACSI is a laptop computer running a software
package operated by an astronaut onboard the station. RACSI double
monitors and checks the ATV mission and provides two simple command
capabilities: temporarily interrupt the mission or command a
collision-avoidance maneuver.</p><p>Currently, both the GOAS and RACSI developments run under
Linux. Although GOAS was developed on Solaris (using versions 1 and
2), the software was ported to Linux without difficulties. RACSI
was originally programmed entirely under Linux. For both systems,
Linux was chosen as the underlying operating system because it
provides four basic features required by up-to-date space
applications: reliability, performance, portability and
affordability. Reliability is crucial to space applications. The
feature of reliability is guaranteed by the robustness of Linux:
both applications run dozens of processes concurrently, using
extensively shared memories and semaphores. The software never
crashes or misbehaves, despite the fact that both systems were
designed to run nonstop for weeks or even months.</p><p>Performance is the definitive factor in measuring real-time
critical software. Although Linux is not used in real-time mode
(the RT-Linux module is not loaded), the applications run in real
time. That is, they receive data from the spacecraft, display it
and send it back to the satellite, all in real time. Everything
runs within the specified communications rate between craft.</p><p>Software portability is of vital importance for upgrades and
applications enhancement. Portability among UNIX flavors can be
done quickly, preserving expandability and keeping manpower costs
down. This is not true for other non-UNIX operating systems. In
addition, Linux is available for an enormous range of hardware
platforms, making the change between platforms as simple as
recompiling (in most cases).</p><p>Nowadays, space applications often lack the funds needed to
buy costly licenses. Linux is a zero-cost operating system, which
provides true affordability. It can be copied as many times as
desired, keeping license costs and royalties low. This is true not
only for the operating system but also for the tools (compilers,
debuggers, editors, development environments, etc.) which come with
it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb46580.0xc3e9d0"></a>RACSI in Space</h2></div></div><p><a href="3024f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2. RASCI
Screenshot</b></span></a></p><p>RACSI runs on an IBM ThinkPad laptop. The software requires
64MB of RAM and occupies around 40MB of disk space. (See Figure 2.)
This type of laptop was chosen due to the hard radiation resistance
requirements on the space station. It also provides an XGA
graphical screen with a resolution of 1024x756 and 64K colors,
mandatory for displaying trajectories and spacecraft equipment
status. RACSI uses the X Window System (X11R6) with FVWM as its
window manager. The Linux distribution currently installed on the
laptop is Slackware version 3.0 with kernel 2.0.30.</p><p>A desktop configuration system has been installed on a
Pentium Pro, running S.u.S.E. 5.2 with kernel 2.0.33. The pointing
device of the system is the laptop track ball, although a
conventional mouse can also be used.</p><p>RACSI was programmed entirely in ANSI C. It uses the Moo-Tiff
libraries from InfoMagic version 2.0, so all widgets are Motif
type. (FVWM fulfills the complete look appeal of the application.)
The system uses shared memories and the Linux file system as
database storage for telemetry data coming from the spacecraft.
RACSI process interfaces make use of application program interfaces
(APIs). The APIs constitute an additional layer of software, which
allows hiding the differences between local and remote software
calls between applications. The software of RACSI is subdivided
into several modules (see Figure 3) according to a modular
architecture compliant with ESA software standards.</p><p><a href="3024f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3. RACSI
Architecture</b></span></a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Telemetry Handler</b></span>: this
function is a data-handling module. It receives all incoming types
of data from the spacecraft and preprocesses them to generate an
additional set of data valid for storage and archiving. Next, this
module distributes the data to a predefined set of client
applications (e.g., Mission and Vehicle Monitoring and
Control).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mission and Vehicle
Monitoring</b></span>: this module allows the astronaut to have an
overview of the status of both the mission and the vehicle. The
Mission and Vehicle Monitoring module extracts data from the
Telemetry Handler function and sends it to the Information
Presentation function. This function provides a set of displays
showing, with different levels of detail, information related to
the mission and the vehicle extracted from the telemetry or
resulting from any other data processing.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Failure Detection and
Assessment</b></span>: this function performs the detection and
identification of a failure. When a failure is detected, the
astronaut is free to manually interrupt the mission (stop the
spacecraft) or abort the current mission plan (give control to
ground).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Display Management</b></span>: the
purpose of this function is to provide an on-screen data
presentation to the astronaut. RACSI screens are organized in three
areas (see Figure 2): mission display (with information related to
mission phase, mission transitions, etc.), main display area
(trajectory plotting, equipment surveillance, etc.) and messages
display area (local messages and warnings).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Telecommand Handler</b></span>: this
module provides centralized services to send two possible orders to
the spacecraft: mission interrupt or a collision-avoidance
maneuver.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb46580.0xc3f108"></a>GOAS on the Ground</h2></div></div><p><a href="3024f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4. GOAS
Screenshot</b></span></a></p><p>The native GOAS system runs on a Sun workstation, Ultra-SPARC
5, with 64MB of RAM and 300MB of hard disk space. A color monitor
is mandatory. (See Figure 4.) This configuration runs under Solaris
(version 2.5). It uses the X (X11R6) graphical user interface, with
Sun OpenLook as the window manager.</p><p>The Linux version was developed from this initial system; the
Linux GOAS runs on a 233MHz Pentium with 48MB of RAM. This system
also uses X11R6, with Linux OpenLook as the window manager. The
pointing device is a mouse, although using keystrokes is
allowed.</p><p>GOAS was programmed in the C and C++ languages. C is used for
programming the applications, C++ for programming the graphical
interface. GOAS uses a collection of commercial off-the-shelf
software routines (ILOG views) to build certain parts of the
man-machine interface.</p><p>GOAS can run with two or three monitors at the same time,
allowing the viewing of many spacecraft parameters. It is possible
to configure a different monitor to display the man-machine
interface of the monitoring, failure detection, replanning modules,
etc. Like RACSI, the software of GOAS is subdivided into several
modules (see Figure 5), according to a modular architecture
compliant with ESA software standards. However, GOAS is much more
complex in terms of mission planning capabilities, trajectory
prediction and failure detection and recovery.</p><p><a href="3024f5.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 5. GOAS
Architecture</b></span></a></p><p>The Telemetry Handler receives the data from the spacecraft,
archives it in several databases and broadcasts it to the necessary
clients in the system.</p><p>The Failure Assessment subsystem performs the detection and
identification of a failure by running a set of automatic tests
under the control of the ground operator, are implemented at the
mission, guidance, navigation and control levels, and compare both
the actual and predicted state with reference corridors for
position, attitude, rates, etc. This module archives data in a
database.</p><p>In case of problems, the Failure Assessment module decides
which recovery procedure should be applied to recover the mission:
the Fast Intervention module when the recovery must be immediate,
the Short-Term Recovery actions or a complete Mission
Replanning.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Fast Intervention</b></span>: the
emergency actions managed by this function allow interrupting the
mission. The ground operator is confronted with a predefined set of
emergency actions: stop the spacecraft, initiate a drift out of the
station inhibiting the thrusters, or initiate a collision-avoidance
maneuver directly controlling the spacecraft thrusters. This
strategy will prevent collision with the station.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Short Term Recovery</b></span>: this
function is used in situations where recovery allows a period of
time between 5 and 15 minutes. The goal is to stabilize the
mission, and afterwards to start the Replanning function once that
situation is reached. If safety is not compromised, different Short
Term Recovery actions can be launched: force switching of some
equipment to the redundant ones, quick study of the impact of the
coming maneuvers, activation of a short sequence of maneuvers,
etc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mission Replanning</b></span>: the
purpose of this function is to support the operator intervention
when the mission needs to be changed. It is a feature not present
in RACSI&mdash;an astronaut cannot replan a mission; only the ground
control center can. The Replanning function is launched on request.
It supports the ground operator in the definition of a new mission
plan according to three items: replanning scenario, mission
constraints and status of the chaser equipment. This function can
be run in automatic mode (the computer replans a whole new mission
without operator intervention), semi-automatic (the operator is
asked for some parameters) or manual (the operator constructs the
maneuver sequence step-by-step). Visual information is constantly
displayed to the operator.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb46580.0xc3f840"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>The success of Linux is grounded in the fact that the work
created by one group of people is not owned by any other group of
people. Reliability, performance, portability and affordability are
the four characteristics which convinced ESA to use it for
real-time spacecraft control software. Important work still needs
to be done; hopefully, the coming kernels will be POSIX compliant,
plug-and-play will be truly available and multimedia capabilities
will be extended beyond user expectations. I am almost certain that
Linux will run onboard the International Space Station or in any of
the ISS components' ground control centers around the globe. Linux
has earned its excellent reputation and can successfully compete
with all other available operating systems.</p></div></div>
