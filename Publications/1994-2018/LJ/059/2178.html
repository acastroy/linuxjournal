    A look at multilingual Emacs.

Emacs) first appeared at the end of 1992. After almost five years,
the Mule enhancements were included with GNU Emacs 20.x. For those
of us who have yearned for multi-script capability since our first
encounter with a computer (more than twenty years ago), it has been
a long and often frustrating wait. We are now at GNU Emacs version
20.4 and things are finally beginning to look interesting to people
who wish to work with multiple scripts on Linux. I am using Emacs
for translation, exegesis and preparing reference material in
multiple scripts.
</p><p>Who wants to install a special Japanese Linux just to be able
to read a Japanese source file for a translation job or read and
write Japanese e-mail? I want to be able to include Chinese
bibliographies, text and notes in the papers I write. I would also
like to be able to include Tibetan or Greek scripts for
philosophical or technical terms, along with their transliteration
into Latin script. When I am discussing the structure of Chinese
characters, I want to be able to make comparisons with Egyptian
hieroglyphs. I want my quotations of French and German to look like
French and German. I want to be able to publish all this on web
pages as well as my PostScript printer. Some high-priced programs
are coming out that address these issues, but Emacs 20.4 is here
now. It runs on the best generally available operating system in
the world, GNU/Linux, and it is free.</p><p><a href="2178f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure
1</b></span></a></p><p>As an example of using Emacs to prepare multi-script
reference material, let's look at the Buddhist numerical lists I am
currently working on. Without much difficulty, I can write this
list with a pen on a piece of paper. See Figure 1 for a bitmap of a
page from my handwritten list. (Apologies for my poor calligraphy.)
To get these scripts into a computer text file requires an input
method specific to each script. Fortunately, Emacs comes with
Quail, which has a method to input each script in this example and
many more.</p><p>To invoke Quail for Devanagari, use the Mule menu or
type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ctrl-x return
ctrl-\ devanagar-transliteration
</pre><p>Three other choices are available. For Tibetan, you will want
<b  >tibetan-wylie</b>. For Chinese, more than twenty
methods are available. I use <b  >chinese-py-b5</b> for
traditional characters and <b  >chinese-tonepy</b> for
the simplified characters. The Quail Japanese input method is
adequate for short strings, but not extensive input. This is one
place where I feel a free input method editor for Linux is needed
that equals or surpasses Microsoft's free Japanese IME for Windows.
Wnn 4.2, the last free version of Wnn, worked well. I have used it
in the past with Mule, but so far I have not be able to get it to
work with Emacs.
</p><p>Soon, I hope to add the Korean, Thai, Lao and Vietnamese
equivalents of each term in each list. All these are supported by
Emacs. Finally, I hope to add the Mongolian script, which is not
yet available in Emacs.</p><p>As you start to use several different input methods, you may
soon find the command to invoke them,
<b  >ctrl-x&nbsp;return ctrl-\</b> cumbersome.
I rebind it with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
meta-x global-set-key f3 return
set-input-method
</pre><p>While you're at it, you might as well bind the command
<span   class="bold"><b>universal-coding-system-argument</b></span>
to something handy&mdash;I use f2.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>universal-coding-system-argument</b></span>
is the command that lets you specify which coding system you want
Emacs to use when you execute your next command. If you do much
multi-script work, this will probably be
<b  >ctrl-x&nbsp;ctrl-v&nbsp;return</b>, which revisits
the file you just visited. On the revisit, Emacs uses the coding
system you specified as the universal-coding-system-argument. From
the main Emacs menu, you can select Mule/Set Coding System/Next
Command to do the same thing. (See Emacs Manual 31.4.5 for details
on rebinding keys.)</p><p>For information on each input method and sometimes a list of
the characters you can use with it, type <b  >ctrl-h
I</b>. As usual in Emacs, tab will give you a list of choices
if you don't know the exact name of the input method you are after.
<b  >ctrl-g</b> escapes from whatever you are doing in
the mini-buffer. I said &ldquo;sometimes&rdquo; because some lists are
missing. For example, in response to
<b  >ctrl-h&nbsp;I&nbsp;ipa</b>, Emacs returns &ldquo;Input
method: ipa (IPA in mode line) for IPA International Phonetic
Alphabet for English, French, German and Italian&rdquo; but provides no
list of the actual symbols. For Devanagari, on the other hand, a
full list of the letters of the script is presented. Not given are
the details on how to evoke several operations essential for being
able to input the script properly. If you are familiar with the
script, you can probably hack your way through. If, like me, you
are a beginner and merely attempting to input it from a
transcription in Latin script, even assuming your transcription is
precise, you will not be pleased. Detailed descriptions of the
various input methods are needed.</p><p>Start with Tibetan. Type the Wylie transliteration and the
script appears&mdash;very smooth. For beginners, it is easier than
writing Tibetan by hand. For the time being, I had to give up
trying to input Devanagari. You may have better luck.</p><p>All these input methods come in a package called Leim. As of
this writing, Leim is bundled with the Emacs-20.3.92 from
ftp://ftp.etl.go.jp/pub/mule/.notready/, but it must be downloaded
as a separate package for the Emacs pre-release from
ftp://alpha.gnu.org/. Anyway, if Emacs cannot find all files
included with Leim when it compiles on your system, you won't have
any input methods. Let's hope the distributions will include Leim
by default and give you an option to exclude it.</p><p>To evoke the multi-script capabilities of the new Emacs,
another essential ingredient is Intlfonts 1.x. At present, it is
version 1.2. This package provides all the fonts you need to
display all the scripts. It, too, must be installed before you will
find any joy in multi-script work.</p><p>The latest version of ps-print.el that comes with Emacs
allows you to at least dump your multiple-script files to the laser
printer. Currently, you must be content with &ldquo;not scalable&rdquo;
bit-mapped fonts where one size fits all, but this is an essential
first step. Perhaps CJK-TeX by Werner Lemberg
(xlwy01@uxp1.hrz.uni-dortmund.de) or Omega, the new, purportedly
internationalized TeX, will generously give us the ability to
produce high-class, camera-ready, multi-script output for printing
and a description of how to do it.</p><p><a href="2178f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure
2</b></span></a></p><p>In Figure 2, we see the same text as in Figure 1 entered into
an Emacs buffer, or as much of it as I could enter without a better
understanding of the Devanagari input method.</p><p>It could be argued that we should not look to Emacs for help
in printing, aside from the minimum requirement of being able to
dump multi-script texts to the printer. Maybe the same holds for
Web publishing&mdash;I don't know. However, it is frustrating to create
a document in five or more scripts perfectly well in Emacs and then
not be able to print it at a camera-ready level of quality, or
publish it on the Web where the only character set that would allow
the inclusion of all five scripts, with some on-going support, is
Unicode, particularly in its UTF-8 encoding.</p><p>If there were an option to map the multi-script file in Emacs
to the Unicode character set and then save it in UTF-8 encoding,
ithe file would be directly available as content for an XML or HTML
document. True, some browsers cannot understand Unicode yet, and
the browser user may not have all the fonts installed, but this is
bound to change for the better soon. One thing for sure: few will
be able to read it in Mule internal format or even in a mix of
ISO-2022 character sets/encodings.</p><p>Regarding a Unicode converter for Emacs, Miyashita Hisashi
took a first shot at a Mule internal-encoding-to-Unicode converter
with his MULE-UCS converter, but as of this writing I have not been
able to install it. I noticed on the Unicode mailing list that Mark
Leisher (mleisher@crl.nmsu.edu) also has one under construction.
Hopefully, by the time this article is printed, we will be able to
produce a Unicode/UTF-8-encoded file from Emacs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cb5580.0x1dae000"></a>Emacs Help for the Translator</h2></div></div><p>Once you have entered the multiple scripts into your Emacs
buffer, you can marshal all the considerable forces of Emacs to
work on your text. This is the big difference between Emacs and a
program like Gasper Sinai's Yudit, for example. From a user's
perspective, Yudit deals nicely with the encoding problems and it
includes support for Unicode from the ground up, but most other
features of a well-rounded editor have not yet been
implemented.</p><p>Since Emacs is multilingual, it is also bilingual. Pick any
two-language combination. I translate from Chinese to English (CE),
mostly classical texts, and from Japanese to English, mostly
commercial work for pay. Emacs has much to offer a JE or CE
translator.</p><p>Emacs offers such helpful services as saving your cursor
position in a buffer between sessions, saving the buffer
arrangement of your Emacs session, splitting frames into Emacs
windows and placing new frames in strategic locations on your big
translator's virtual desktop, la FVWM2. It is also easily
customized.</p><p>The five items of Emacs arcana that can be especially useful
to a translator are saving and backup, outline minor mode,
narrowing, abbrevs and bookmarks. See http://www.kanji.com/ for a
more detailed version of the following.</p><p>Saving and Backup Using autosave</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>autosave</b></span> is continuously
taking care of the job of saving the latest version of your file.
Use <b  >ctrl-h&nbsp;v&nbsp;auto-save-interval</b> to
check your current value for autosave. In the directory listing, an
autosave version of your file is marked by pound signs (#),
prefixed and suffixed to the filename.</p><p>I use <b  >make-backup-file</b> to automatically
produce sequentially numbered versions or drafts of my work. In
this view, the file is complete right from the beginning, as soon
as I save it with a name for the first time. Once my file has a
name, it automatically becomes the &ldquo;first version&rdquo;.</p><p>It took a while to break my old habit of manually saving my
file as often as possible, indeed each time I leaned back in my
chair. Now I save only when I am ready to take a long break (like
several hours or overnight), or when I feel I have reached the
logical end of a certain draft version. The result is that I have
only one autosave file at any given time, and a new draft (backup)
file is produced at meaningful intervals. Use <b  >ctrl-h v
make-backup-files</b> to check or set. Use <b  >ctrl-h v
version-control</b> to check your current setting and the
&ldquo;customize&rdquo; button found therein to turn on numbered
backups.</p><p>By default, automatic deletion of backups will occur, thereby
ruining the use of backups as a translator's simple version control
system. Check the variables <b  >kept-old-versions</b>
and <b  >kept-new-versions</b>. The default is 2, i.e.,
the first two and last two backups are kept; other backups are
removed. To keep all backups, I set these variables to 500 each so
a thousand backups will be kept before the ones in the middle are
removed. After a translation job is finished, I usually delete them
all.</p><p>Not only will you want to save your files, but also your
constellation of visited buffers. This is done through the use of
the Emacs desktop. Add these three lines to your .emacs
file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(load "desktop")
(desktop-load-default)
(desktop-read)
</pre><p>You must use <b  >meta-x&nbsp;desktop-save</b> to
initiate this process and then start Emacs from the same current
directory each time you need to recover this state.
</p><p>You can also save state within an Emacs session by using a
register.</p><p>Outline Minor Mode</p><p>Until a full-scale major mode for translation is written,
<b  >outline-mode</b> or
<b  >outline-minor-mode</b> must take on the
responsibility of managing the source text, the target text and
related notes, comments and references.</p><p>In outline mode, there are two kinds of lines: header lines
and body lines. Header lines start with a star in the leftmost
column. The more stars, the deeper the level into the outline. One
star means the line is at the top level. For short jobs, I have
only one top-level heading line with the words TOP LEVEL or the
title of the job. In longer jobs, I use it for Part One, Part Two,
etc. I put contact information that applies to the whole job and
notes about the deadline, size, charges and any special provisions
as body lines below this top-level heading.</p><p>Within my translation environment, body text means notes and
commentary. I find it extremely convenient to embed these directly
in the working file rather than keep them as separate files. Such
inter-linear notes are thus permanently welded to the text to which
they relate.</p><p>Outline level 2 is always the Japanese or Chinese source text
and level 3 is always my target text, the English translation. If I
suspect there is a typo in the Japanese source text, my proposed
correction can appear in the body lines connected to those level 2
heading lines, i.e., to those particular lines of the Japanese
source text. Likewise, definitions, questions, reference sources,
comments and notes on words, URLs and anything else that throws
light on the translation are set down in body lines that are
directly connected to the level 3 heading lines, which are always
the English target text I am writing.</p><p>When I am finished translating, a keyboard macro strips out
the level 3 lines (my translation) and produces the file that will
go either directly to the client or through some unavoidable
conversion, and even formatting, in a word processor running on
Linux, such as ApplixWords.</p><p>It would be nice to see <b  >outline-mode</b>
generalized into a &ldquo;show and hide&rdquo; mode so that you could show
body lines alone at whatever level you choose.</p><p>Narrowing</p><p>In effect, <b  >outline-mode</b> or
<b  >outline-minor-mode</b> gives us a pre-structured
kind of narrowing. Narrowing is more general in the sense that it
can be arbitrarily applied to any portion of text in the buffer.
Furthermore, with <b  >outline-mode</b> or
<b  >outline-minor-mode</b>, it is quite possible to edit
large chunks of the buffer that are not currently displayed. For
example, if you delete or move the heading line, the entire entry
under it including its body lines is deleted or moved. Narrowing,
on the other hand, restricts editing to the narrowed portion alone.
Place a mark at one end and point at the other. Then type
<b  >ctrl-x&nbsp;n&nbsp;n</b> and the accessible portion
of the buffer will be reduced to precisely that region only. See
the right-hand buffer in Figures 3 and 4 for examples. In both, the
right-hand buffer is narrowed. Only the accessible portion is
available for editing. <b  >ctrl-x&nbsp;n&nbsp;w</b>
widens, to make the entire buffer accessible again.</p><p><a href="2178f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure
3</b></span></a></p><p><a href="2178f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure
4</b></span></a></p><p>In Figure 3, what you see is reduced to just the Japanese
source text and the English target text, i.e., level 2 and level 3
outline &ldquo;heading lines&rdquo;. In Figure 4, what you see is expanded to
include snips from on-line dictionaries, notes and comments, i.e.,
outline &ldquo;body lines&rdquo;. But the accessible portion produced by
narrowing is the same in both cases. For Figures 3 and 4, I used
outline mode to keep source text, translation, abbrevs, glossary
entries, notes and commentary all in one file. The left buffer
shows only level 2 outline header lines, i.e., the Japanese source
text, whereas the right buffer in Figure 3 shows this plus the
target text and Figure 4 shows all three: source, target and
notes.</p><p>Abbrevs</p><p>I use abbrevs primarily to help enforce consistency on my
English target texts but also to avoid some typing.</p><p>Let me take an example from my non-commercial work but which
applies to all types of CE/JE translation as well. Buddhism has a
large vocabulary of &ldquo;technical terms&rdquo; that constantly reappear.
In the Buddhist texts I work on, five of the most frequent
are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>prajnaparamita <b  >-&gt;</b> pp</p></li><li><p>mahaprajnaparamita-sutra <b  >-&gt;</b>
mpps</p></li><li><p>utmost, right and perfect enlightenment
<b  >-&gt;</b> urpe</p></li><li><p>bodhisattva <b  >-&gt;</b> bs</p></li><li><p>the buddha said <b  >-&gt;</b> tbs</p></li></ul></div><p>With <b  >abbrev mode</b> turned on
(<b  >meta-x&nbsp;abbrev-mode</b>), typing
<b  >bs</b> followed by a space instantly inserts
<b  >bodhisattva</b>, <b  >pp</b> inserts
<b  >prajnaparamita</b>, etc. With <b  >abbrev
mode</b> turned off, I can still force an insert before point
(the position of the cursor) with
<b  >ctrl-x&nbsp;a&nbsp;e</b>
(<b  >expand-abbrev</b>).</p><p>When I am working on a commercial, technical JE translation
job related to Linux, for example, I want to forget about
Buddhist-related abbrevs, so I save and load files of abbrevs as
appropriate.</p><p>Bookmarks and Registers</p><p>Bookmarks have arbitrary (long) names and remain from one
Emacs session to another. Registers have one-letter names and
disappear as soon as a session is ended. A bookmark tells Emacs
where to go in a buffer, whereas a register stores data to insert
into a buffer, such as a filename, a window configuration, a piece
of text or a rectangle. Yes, a register can also store a location
and thereby pretend it is a temporary bookmark.</p><p>You would think the proper function of a bookmark is simply
to mark your place in a file so that whenever you revisit it, you
will go to that location; however, I don't need bookmarks for this.
I usually leave off at the location I want to return to, so that
simply switching buffers via command, menu or
<b  >ctrl-mouse_button_1</b> takes me back to where I
was. Revisiting a file takes me there too, because I have
<b  >place-saving</b> turned on. (Use
<b  >toggle-save-place</b> to turn it on for a specific
file and <b  >setq-default&nbsp;save-place&nbsp;t</b> to
turn it on globally for all files. [Added in Emacs version 19.19.])
Therefore, I feel free to use bookmarks for something less
ordinary.
<b  >ctrl-x&nbsp;r&nbsp;m&nbsp;<i><tt>bookmark_name</tt></i></b>
sets the bookmark; the bookmark name is a string of Japanese or
Chinese text, i.e., my glossary entry.</p><p>In Japanese, Emacs automatically sorts the kana bookmark
names. (Kana are the graphic forms used to write the Japanese
syllabary.) When I click on a bookmark, I am propelled directly to
the work file where that word or phrase resides in an actual job.
Beginning with Emacs 19.29, bookmarks could carry annotations.
(Type <b  >ctrl-h m</b> after
<b  >meta-x&nbsp;list-bookmarks</b> for more information
on annotations.) I have co-opted this feature to carry the English
glossary or meanings of the glossary entries (i.e., the bookmark
names). If the annotation is sufficient, I don't need to visit the
glossary entry in its location within a working file. If I want to
see the context in which I have translated the word, phrase or
sentence, one click lets me take a look, regardless of whether that
file is currently being visited by an Emacs buffer or not. I can
display the location in the file in a buffer that replaces my
current bookmark editing buffer or have Emacs put it in a separate
window adjacent to the buffer holding the bookmark list. I can also
just ask Emacs to tell me the name of the file where the bookmark
can be found without actually displaying it.</p><p>The one drawback to this neat, but nonetheless makeshift
device, is that I can assign only one location to each glossary
entry. If I want to add more, I must put them in the
annotation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cb5580.0x1da67d8"></a>Help from Other Programs</h2></div></div><p>Finally, for JE work, Emacs is not alone. As planets circle
the sun, I surround Emacs with several programs that help me figure
out the Japanese or Chinese source text or that aid in delivering
it in a form demanded by a client. My assistants include the
following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sumomo</b></span>: a parser

consistent and persistent, i.e., for a certain task (like CE or JE
translation) you must be able to recreate the same arrangement
quickly. I have an init.hook file configured so that these
applications all start up when I start fvwm2. By renaming it, I can
immediately set up a different desktop for a different task. (See
