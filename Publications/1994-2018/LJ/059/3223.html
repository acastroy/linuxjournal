    A look at one of the fastest growing Linux distributions,

following definition can be found at http://www.linuxrouter.org/;
however, LRP needs a little more thorough explanation than this:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Linux Router Project (LRP) n. A
networking-centric mini-distribution of Linux. LRP is small enough
to fit on a single 1.44MB floppy disk, and makes building and
maintaining routers, terminal servers, and typically embedded
networking systems next to trivial.</p></blockquote></div>

LRP began because of my intense desire to learn Linux. After
mutilating an installation of Slackware and actually installing
Debian 1.0, I finally had a clue as to what was going on. I planned
to dive deep into TCP/IP networking and decided I needed a
dedicated Internet connection for which I would need a router. Of
course, I could have <span   class="emphasis"><em>bought</em></span> a router, but that
would have been too easy (beside, I am too cheap). So I said,
&ldquo;Hey, let's build one. That will be a great way to waste countless
hours&mdash;oops, I mean learn Linux.&rdquo;
</p><p>In my travels for information on building a router with
Linux, I could not actually find anyone who made what I had in
mind. Either they were using a full distribution on a hard drive,
or something on a floppy that was so minimal a second complete
machine was needed to configure the disk. I decided to try to make
this self-contained &ldquo;mini-system&rdquo; myself. I started with a
minimal base install of Debian 1.1 which totaled around 35MB and
began slashing (and fixing what I had broken) until it was down to
around 3.2MB. This was small enough to fit on a 1.68MB floppy as a
gzipped initrd image. It was not pretty, but it did the job as a
router for my 33.6K line, which eventually progressed to
ISDN.</p><p>After several months, I wanted to take what I had made and
create a more generic system for other people to use. I put out the
call on Usenet and a few private lists, then began a mailing list
with a handful of interested people. The rest, as they say, is
history. That mailing list now exceeds 600 names, and at least 25
new downloads of LRP are done each day. This is all with LRP still
remaining mostly unadvertised.</p><p>My single-disk hack job has evolved into a modular
micro-sized operating system. It makes a capable base platform for
just about anything you could want to build for &ldquo;light&rdquo;, secure,
efficient use: routers to terminal servers, mini web servers to DNS
cache and even doorbells. (No, I am not kidding.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bb3580.0x1cab5b0"></a>LRP Defined</h2></div></div><p>First, Linux Router is quite small. The base root file system
is only 2.5MB and compresses down to 830KB. With the addition of a
kernel, it easily fits on a 1.44MB floppy with several hundred
kilobytes to spare for kernel modules and additional packages. A
Zip or LS-120 will provide seemingly limitless space. Flash RAM can
also be used and companies like Sandisk and M-Systems make
Linux-capable products.</p><p>LRP's root file system is contained in a gzipped tar archive.
The directories /etc (etc.lrp), /var/log (log.lrp) and /lib/modules
(modules.lrp) are broken out into their own archives for easier
backup. At boot, the Linux kernel dynamically creates a MINIX file
system on /dev/ram0 and mounts it as / (root). It then extracts the
root archive (root.lrp), storing it in the / directory, then
proceeds to execute <span   class="bold"><b>linuxrc</b></span>.
linuxrc sets up the base root file system (like creating /dev) and
then attempts to mount the boot device and install any remaining
packages (such as etc.lrp, log.lrp, and modules.lrp). The remaining
bootup is noticeably similar to a typical full-sized Debian Linux
install.</p><p>The system will be running solid state from the RAM disk.
This means all changes you make will have to be backed up to the
boot medium. This is not a difficult task, as it is all automated
by scripts that can recreate the root and add-on packages from
package listing files found in the /var/lib/lrpkg directory.
<span   class="bold"><b>lrcfg</b></span> is a menuing system that
gives you a nice interface to the package backup system as well as
configuration files and (minimal) on-line help.</p><p>Note that LRP does <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> have to run from
RAM. It is perfectly fine just to dump the root and package
archives to a hard drive partition and bypass the &ldquo;embedded&rdquo; RAM
disk features.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bb3580.0x1cab8c8"></a>Included in LRP</h2></div></div><p>If you should drop to the command line, you will find ash as
your default shell. ash supports full Bourne shell scripting, and
nearly the entire LRP base is fully customizable shell scripts.
Moving around at shell level, it will be hard to tell you are not
using a full distribution.</p><p>Some of the finer details include complete SysVInit, cron,
libc6 (glibc) and sed. The system and binaries are generally kept
up to date with the current Debian release. Over 60 commands are
available in minimal or emulated form (using ash and sed): cat, cp,
dmesg, dd, grep, cut, passwd, gzip, tar, tail, mnc (mini-netcat),
et al. Of course, all standard and many extended networking
commands and daemons are also available: route, netstat, ipfwadm,
ipautofw, ipportfw, inetd, telnetd, tftpd, routed, et al. Anthony's
Editor (ae) serves as your editor.</p><p>If this is not enough, you can also load Secure Shell, pppd
2.3.5, Portslave RADIUS client, gated, snmpd and others. Add-on
packages such as minicom and bash 2.0 are also available. Add-on
packages are installed once and merged with the root archive at
back-up time, unlike full packages which are kept
autonomous.</p><p>Slackware users can stuff in almost anything else by hand.
Remember that LRP is <span   class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> Linux&mdash;just smaller.
It is capable of running anything a full-size distribution can run,
given the libraries and space.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bb3580.0x1cabb30"></a>Uses of LRP</h2></div></div><p>By design, LRP is meant for low-level networking
applications. To this extent, the stock Linux 2.0 LRP kernel is
compiled with almost all networking options and several enhancement
patches (for example, ipportfw). Next is a short list of default
functionality available in the base. Understand that these features
apply to any interface type Linux can use, from modem to wireless
T1.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Full IP routing with numberless IP and multiple IP
interfacing</p></li><li><p>Complete firewalling and IP accounting</p></li><li><p>Traffic shaping (low-speed links)</p></li><li><p>IP and Port (TCP/UDP) redirection with transparent
proxy and IP load balancing</p></li><li><p>Extended Common NAT (IP Masquerade) as firewall
rules</p></li><li><p>Media insensitive interface load balancing
(EQL)</p></li><li><p>RIP, OSPF, BGP and other routing protocols (via
gated and other packages)</p></li><li><p>IPX and AppleTalk support</p></li></ul></div><p>Past these core functions, a Linux Router unit is quite
viable for many server applications. One of the most popular is
using the Portslave RADIUS client software (pslave.lrp) to host
inbound Internet access modem pools, which give you functionality
like the popular Livingston Portmaster series. Bind is packaged
(bind.lrp) and does a fine job as a secondary or even primary DNS.
Boa (boa.lrp) and thttpd (thttpd.lrp) are both small web servers
that will fit on a 1.44MB LRP disk. Apache, though not packaged
right now, could be hand fit.
</p><p>On the client side of things, the VNC package will give you a
single-disk Windows terminal. XFree86 is not yet packaged, but it
certainly will be, allowing easy creation of X terminals. Linux
Router also makes a good base for workstations that mount their
file system from remote NFS or SMB (Samba) servers.</p><p>Understand that Linux Router is not the solution to all your
computing needs. You wouldn't want to use it as your primary web
server if you are an Internet Service Provider, or as a kernel
hacker's development machine. But for backup services or where
feature requirements are very specific (and administration skills
scarce), it makes an efficient and sound choice.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bb3580.0x1cac318"></a>The Advantages of LRP</h2></div></div><p>While a &ldquo;minimal&rdquo; install of Debian Linux may have well
over 5000 files, you would be lucky to break 500 with a very
feature-rich LRP. The impact of this on administration and security
is obvious; the entire system can be backed up and restored in less
than a minute.</p><p>This minimal footprint coupled with RAM disk operation adds
up to a large performance increase in operation and decrease in
required hardware. The most mediocre 16MHz 386SX with 8MB of RAM, a
1.44MB floppy and no video card can handle most people's needs for
light routing jobs. Few will have a need to climb past a 486 class
CPU; however, with low-end Pentium class machines being so
inexpensive, it certainly makes sense to do so.</p><p>Furthermore, with this default RAM disk approach, it is very
difficult to be left with an unusable system. File system get
corrupted? Flash the power. Everything just crashed? Flash the
power. Cracker break in? Install your backup (in 30 seconds) and
flash the power.</p><p>The other advantage of running from a RAM disk that people
seem to overlook is, generally, it <span   class="emphasis"><em>cannot
break</em></span>. Let's say you have 250 workstations with one path
to the outside world. Do you want that path to depend on a
mechanical device like a hard drive? Probably not. How about if
that router sits between you and your game of Quake? Definitely
not.</p><p>Some of the many reasons to use LRP over other Linux systems:
fully administrable via high-strength encryption using secure shell
and secure copy (ssh, scp), a huge routing feature super set and
open source. These are things most commercial solutions cannot
touch.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bb3580.0x1cac5d8"></a>Locating LRP</h2></div></div><p>By now, I am sure you are probably excited to give Linux
Router a try. Since it is now easier than ever to make a disk, you
should do it.</p><p>All that needs to be done to get started is creating a file
system and installing a boot loader on your boot medium. The most
common choice for this is MS-DOS (FAT) and Peter Anvin's SysLinux.
GRUB also makes a good boot loader. LILO is generally a poor
choice, because unlike the former two, it cannot dynamically search
for the kernel by name, and LRP does not have LILO available if you
change kernels. Default syslinux.cfg and syslinux.dpy files are
available at the LRP ftp site.</p><p>An LRP-capable kernel can be found in the kernel*.tar.gz
archive. Choose an FPU (floating-point unit) or non-FPU kernel as
needed and copy it to the disk as &ldquo;LINUX&rdquo;.</p><p>Copy the base and any additional packages; root.lrp, etc.lrp
and log.lrp are required. modules.lrp is also needed if you are
using a kernel with modules, as the provided LRP kernels do.</p><p>Finally, you must update the options passed to the kernel at
boot time, commonly known as the boot loader's &ldquo;append&rdquo; line. A
sample syslinux.cfg file looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
display syslinux.dpy
append=load_ramdisk=1 initrd=root.lrp \
initrd_archive=minix ramdisk_size=4096 \ root=/dev/ram0
boot=/dev/fd0,msdos \
LRP=etc,log,modules
</pre><p>The options after <b  >append=</b> will be common
to any boot loader you use. The LRP-specific options are:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >initrd_archive=minix</b>:
initrd_archive is a kernel feature that lets you use tar.gz
archives instead of raw images. This kernel patch is required in
order to use LRP.</p></li><li><p><b  >boot=/dev/<i><tt>bootdev</tt></i>[,<i><tt>fs</tt></i>]</b>:
this is the device name you are booting from. It is the device
which linuxrc will try to mount to install any remaining packages.
Optionally, you can specify the file system for the mount attempt.
The boot line is semi-optional. linuxrc has a back-up list of
devices to try to mount. It looks at /proc/filesystems for
available file systems. Using <b  >boot=</b> speeds up
the boot process and ensures a mount if you are using an odd boot
device.</p></li><li><p><b  >LRP=etc.lrp,log.lrp[,modules.lrp][,package1]
[,package2]...</b>: these are the packages linuxrc should try
to load at boot time. Remember that root.lrp is loaded by the
initrd facility of the boot loader, so
<span   class="bold"><b>etc</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>log</b></span> are the first packages listed
here.</p></li></ul></div>

If your goal is simply a 1.44MB LRP floppy, the FTP site contains a
raw &ldquo;idiot-image&rdquo; of such a disk. It is fully prepared with
syslinux and a non-FPU kernel; just use dd, cat or a similar
utility to write the image to a floppy.
</p><p>With your base prepared, you must add the needed kernel
modules. Normally, one does this by booting the LRP disk, mounting
a second floppy, copying the modules from that floppy to
/lib/modules, editing /etc/modules and then using lrcfg to back up
the modules package. Sound too hard? See
http://www.linuxrouter.org/modmaker/ for a modules generation
system. Just select the modules for the features and hardware you
want; it will create a modules.lrp with the modules, their
dependencies and an /etc/modules file configured to load all of
them.</p><p>After boot and login, lrcfg will be started to help you get
around to the files you need to edit. The configuration files for
the base and packages are self-documented. You should be only a few
minutes away from a working system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bb3580.0x20a5170"></a>Difficulty and Support</h2></div></div><p>For a person with some UNIX networking experience, LRP is
truly as easy as it sounds. However, it may be difficult for people
who lack these basic skills. Still, it is not too intimidating and
the average Linux, MS-DOS or MS Windows user has been known to
tackle the entire task with no help.</p><p>The mailing list is capable of getting most people over any
walls they encounter. If all else fails, both Paul Wouters
(paul@xtdnet.nl) and I currently provide commercial support for
those requiring extended help with their setup.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bb3580.0x20a52d0"></a>Commercial Products</h2></div></div><p>Linux Router is known to be in use around the world. I know
of several consultants who use it exclusively for networking their
customers. It is also becoming popular with vertical applications
and has been spotted in control systems and power switching
stations.</p><p>Onyx Systems (http://www.onyxsys.com/) is developing a
mid-range modular router and terminal server product based entirely
on LRP. Look for it to appear about the time this article is
published. This is the most adventurous application using Linux
Router I have found (sort of a cross between a Cisco 2524 and
Portmaster 3). It is also the first open-source product of its
kind&mdash;how exciting! Keep it in mind when you need trusted hardware
with commercial support.</p><p>Rumors are circulating that Corel has been thinking about a
port of Linux Router to ARM for a FlashRAM-only NetWinder. This
project sounds like it has many possibilities as well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bb3580.0x20a5488"></a>Development</h2></div></div><p>At the time of this writing, 2.9.4 just went out as an
unstable release, getting us a bit closer to a stable 3.0 release.
I still handle all of the core LRP development myself and could use
more people to help speed development of the base. Making LRP
packages is quite easy, and I would like to see more people
contributing them. If you have the skills and are interested in
