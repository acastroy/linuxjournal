    A couple of weeks ago I posted the following to the Usenet newsgroup
    comp.os.linux.misc.
    I am the editor of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, a paper magazine that will be
    covering
    the Linux scene.  In my correspondence with people about writing
    articles
    for <i  >LJ</i> I have seen an amazing number of ham calls.  Being a ham
    myself
    (WA6SWR) I was just wondering how many of &ldquo;us&rdquo; are hams.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1993580.0x1a8b2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you are a ham, let me know and maybe
include a short blurb about how/why you got involved in Linux. I
think it could be interesting. I will post a summary and might even
include the info in an upcoming issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.
</p><p>Rather than try to draw any conclusions I have decided to
just post what people said. I think hams will find it interesting.
Note that in the ham tradition I edited the signatures so they
consist of the person's first name and ham call unless they didn't
give me a call. Then I include the full name.</p><p>Assuming there are no objections (and enough space) I plan to
reprint this in the March issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. I think it helps tie Linux into another
community. One who has traditionally been on the leading edge of
both technology and spending as little money as possible.
:-)</p><p>Any hams out there doing &ldquo;ham stuff&rdquo; with Linux and want to
write an article about it for <i  >Linux Journal</i>?</p><p>The SLS/slackware distributions have basically given me a
UNIX/X workstation at home...wish my 486 was as fast as the Indigo
on campus though.</p><p>I've been using Linux for over a year on a Gateway. I just
now have some time to try hacking on some programs for the
radio.</p><p>Most of the time I'm on 80/20 meter PACTOR. I almost have a
PACSAT station working (still need a preamp and a few other
odds-and-ends).</p><p>I think Linux would work great for automating satellite
uploads and downloads, tracking, etc.<span   class="bold"><b>-Phil
AD4FH</b></span></p><p>Well, this comes to you from host w4bzl.concert.net at the
end of a quite productive SLIP link. Of course this host at home
runs linux. AT CONCERT we have at least two other hams that run
linux with their calls as their hostname. I'll leave it to them to
respond.<span   class="bold"><b>-Joe W4BZL</b></span></p><p>I'm a ham too, N5SNN down in Austin, TX. How I got involved?
Well that's because our lab has too many junks (or goodies in ham
word), that made me just buy a used 486 motherboard and a new
486sx/25 to start a unix-pc using Linux. Why? To replace the
NOS-box that I use for ausgw (austin's packet-internet gateway)
with a better system.</p><p>My linux is now 100% on the Internet (it's under my lab desk
at campus), runs gopher server, anon ftp, and uucp-internet gateway
(private).<span   class="bold"><b>-Paulus N5SNN</b></span></p><p>Add me in there too. BTW, I started using Linux about 6
months before becoming a HAM. Part of the reason for becoming a HAM
was the large number of them involved with
Linux.<span   class="bold"><b>-Jim KD4PPG</b></span></p><p>I am VK4BSB. Packet mail to
VK4BSB@VK4ZGQ.BNE.QLD.AUS.OC<span   class="bold"><b>-Serge
VK4BSB</b></span></p><p>Who, ME? I've been a netnews reader since the Great Renaming.
I decided it was time to start working with the `blood &amp; guts'
of a Unix.....<span   class="bold"><b>-David WB8FOZ</b></span></p><p>I got interested in Linux last year when Algorithm magazine
published a quick blurb about the freely distributed Unix clone and
how great it was. I wasn't able to start playing with it until this
past August when I upgraded my old XT to a 486. Unfortunately, that
also corresponded to my starting a PhD program, so I haven't had
much time to play with Linux, outside of installing SLS 1.03 and
wondering how to patch what doesn't
work!<span   class="bold"><b>-Chris N0OQT</b></span></p><p>I am: Jim Graham, N5IAL /4. I've been a general-class since
`86. I live on Okaloosa Island, in Ft. Walton Beach, FL (NW FL). I
started looking at Linux in mid-1992 as part of my (then) ongoing
search for a UNIX that would run (read, would actually work) on my
386 at home. I finally got a tape drive, which made the
installation much simpler, and a memory upgrade to make Linux
happier, and installed 0.99 PL6 very early this year. Needless to
say, my search for a UNIX system for my machine has ended.</p><p>Oh, I'm also the author of KAMterm, which is a shareware host
mode terminal program for Kantronics TNCs. It currently runs only
under dos (and some dos emulators, I'm told), but I'm working on
porting it over to Linux (don't hold your breath&mdash;due to all of the
things that are going on right now, and the fact that very few
people have contacted me about KAMterm in the last couple of
months, I'm not spending a whole lot of time on it at the
moment...and the port wouldn't be a quick thing to do even if I
were). Of course, there are other issues involved with a Linux
port, such as the fact that KAMterm is shareware, not freeware, and
so on (I need the KAMterm money to pay
bills).<span   class="bold"><b>-Jim N5IAL/4</b></span></p><p>I use Linux because I want to run a Unix system at home. I'm
one of those `sick' people who like the punishment that Unix
systems hurl onto their operators. I hope to working with packet
radio, as I am a avid packeteer. I understand that there is a
version of NOS out for Linux, but have not found it yet. Know
where? I also know KB9CTJ here running it too. Were working
together on this. I hate MSDOS too.<span   class="bold"><b>- Chuck
WO9K</b></span></p><p>I use SunOS 4.1.3 at work and don't particularly fancy DOS or
DOS/Windows. Linux is an excellent OS for learning how to admin
Unix, as the SLS distribution comes complete with lots of
configuration problems. That is the configuration for lots of the
programs provided with SLS are incomplete or wrong, but close
enough that it is better, and more realistic, than course examples.
I will be almost upset if the next distribution has all of the
problems fixed, as requested by so many flames, because I would
have chosen a fixed version had I the opportunity and not learned
nearly as much.</p><p>All the applications that I need for home are available on
Linux and the VC's are great. 386sx/16 with wait states *really*
bogs running X. I am waiting for something in c.o.l.a to brag about
an excellent TNC interface prog/doc set before I buy one and learn
about the real-ether network.<span   class="bold"><b>-Alan
VE3ALO</b></span></p><p>FWIW, I'm not a ham, although I am studying to become one
next year. At this moment I'm using the CB for packet radio. [Don't
panic - Peter is in the Netherlands where apparently you can do
anything with CB as long as the radio is type approved.]</p><p>At this moment Linux is one of the most promising systems for
hams. At this moment several versions of NOS have been ported to
Linux, like Wampes and JNOS.</p><p>The big advantage is that these versions don't suffer from
severe lack of memory like most of the MS-DOS versions. And for the
future, Linux will have the AX.25 protocol in the kernel. The
normal UNIX socket interface will allow easy program development.
It is also rumored that FBB will be ported to Linux when the AX.25
support is built in.<span   class="bold"><b>-Groetjes, Peter
Busser</b></span></p><p>I am WA8USA. I use LINUX on a laptop I have for work (image
and digital signal processing). I went to LINUX because of the
large number of public domain programs that are included in
distributions (or are easily built) and because the availability of
source is helpful in solving problems.<span   class="bold"><b>-Bob
WA8USA</b></span></p><p>I am a ham (ve3ich) and am active in Linux, but the reasons
have little to do with amateur radio. I suspect that the type of
person who is interested in amateur radio would likely be
interested in Linux: doing something technical that is new and
state-of-the-art at a low-cost.</p><p>I've used Unix at work for a number of years, and had various
microcomputers at home. It was a dream of mine to be able to afford
a machine at home that had the hardware and software capabilities
of a Unix workstation. Just over a year ago I bought a PC
specifically for the purpose of running Linux. I learned more about
Unix in the first 3 months of using Linux that in 5 years of
experience with commercial Unix workstations. I now find myself
wishing that the $10,000 Sun workstation that I use at work had
more of the capabilities of the $1,800 Linux PC at
home.<span   class="bold"><b>-Jeff VE3ICH</b></span></p><p>Well, there's my wife N2VIS (Carolyn Carrock) and me N2RDI...
I'm more a Unix admin geek type that got into Amateur Radio than a
ham that got into Unix... My wife dared me to take the test at the
Trenton Computer Festival after hearing me say I could pass it...
If you're looking for writers&mdash;I was a Unix instructor for Pyramid
Technology and a former newspaper editor and reporter... I'm
looking forward to subscribing... and reading every article in <i  >LJ</i>.
My last project&mdash;idasendmail on Linux with pathalias routing. My
next project - 99.14 kernel and making a linux SVR4 lookalike with
all new scripts and the /sbin directory
structure.<span   class="bold"><b>-Bill N2RDI</b></span></p><p>My call is KF6VB, I've been a ham since 1970. Ham radio got
me into electronics, electronics got me into software, software got
me into a nice career . But it all started with ham radio.</p><p>I got into Linux about a year ago, around version 95pl7, I
think. Linux offered me a way to learn about unix without spending
big $$$. Also, it allowed me to upgrade my home UUCP node to a much
more powerful environment than what DOS supported.</p><p>Four years ago, I got my jollies on the radio, talking to
people all over the world. Now propagation is in the toilet, and I
get the same jollies with uucp, email, and News.</p><p>I've also been a student of the Russian language most of my
life, and in the past few years I took two trips to Moscow. The
first one was pre-Linux , in 1988. Then I visited radio amateurs. I
have pictures of Yours Truly at the operating console of the Moscow
Radio Club.</p><p>The second trip was last December; no radio buddies this
time, just people I met through the email. I took the complete
latest SLS distribution with me, and seeded Moscow with Linux! At
that time, people there had heard of it, but never seen it. Even
while I was there, I could see it seading exponentially: people
borrowed my diskettes, copied them and gave them to other people,
who copied them....</p><p>Right now, I am trying to get the Ka9q networking program
running on my 99pl9 system. If I am successful, I will be able to
integrate the amateur and landline email worlds at one console. So
if I say &ldquo;mail wa6xxx@ampr.org&rdquo; the system would automatically
squirt it out the TNC instead of the phone line. Also, since the
Linux box runs 24 hours a day, I would be able to offer routing to
my friends, run an on-the-air ftp site, etc, etc....</p><p>I too, have noticed the multitudes of hams on the linux
groups; what's more, I have seen more and more mention of Linux on
the ham groups. In my mind, hams have two main
characteristics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>They like to communicate</p></li><li><p>They like to play with gadgets.</p></li></ul></div><p>A Linux box is both a powerful communications platform and a
really neat gadget! What ham could
resist?<span   class="bold"><b>-Jerry KF6VB</b></span></p><p>1 more. And soon to be a real US HAM (N5something)--I passed
the Tech exam some time ago. : If you are a ham, let me know and
maybe include a short blurb : about how/why you got involved in
Linux. I think it could be : interesting. I will post a summary and
might even include the : info in an upcoming issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>. I am also doing an AX.25/NETROM
layer in NET-2.<span   class="bold"><b>-Fred N. van
Kempen</b></span></p><p>I'm a radio amateur, and a LINUX user. My computer is not
(yet) connected to packet radio, but once I get around to buy my
own rig, instead of just using the radio club's (SK5EU) gear, it
sure will be. Sadly, TCP/IP on packet seems to be virtually unknown
here in Sweden..<span   class="bold"><b>-Ture
SM5UUO</b></span></p><p>Phil, I'm N4HHE and saw your request to hear from Linux Hams
in the mail- archive on tsx-11.mit.edu. Don't know what kind of
information you are looking for. I use Linux for &ldquo;recreational
computing.&rdquo; When I work (as an electrical engineer) my choice is
Macintosh. Been Unix'ing for over 5 years, usually as the system
administrator, and always made sure I had a Macintosh that I could
use for login. A couple of years ago I &ldquo;ran&rdquo; a 12 machine Silicon
Graphics installation from a 512k Mac. Lots of fun.</p><p>Currently experimenting with TCP/IP over amateur radio.
WAMPES has been running at my home for the last couple of weeks.
See some people gripe about the lack of Linux documentation, they
need to try WAMPES and really learn about lack of
documentation.<span   class="bold"><b>-David N4HHE</b></span></p><p>I'm a ham and I have used Linux since May 1992 I think. I
just can't remember where I heard of Linux first, but I followed
the development of Linux from November 1991 (or maybe December).
First by listening to reports by others, from 23. January I started
to `finger' Linus' account to get the latest news about the state
of Linux. As I said above, in May 1992 (or was it April? Hmm, not
easy to remember.. :-) I started to actually use it, after having
followed the mailing list for some weeks, enough to feel confident
about how to install it and so on. I'm not using Linux for any
ham-related stuff, one of the reasons is that I don't have a PC at
home (I'm using Linux in my job only).<span   class="bold"><b>-Tor
LA1RHA</b></span></p><p>N3PFP. I'm essentially inactive, I only bothered to get
license because I was planning on trying out packet radio. I passed
the written tests up to advanced before I ran out of
testing/checking time that day, but I've never done the code tests
(and probably couldn't break 10wpm at my peak). ... still looking
for a cheap, short-range 56k-1Mbs packet radio
setup.<span   class="bold"><b>-Donald N3PFP</b></span></p><p>I am a ham, WB4ARV, but I only use linux at work. I at least
have been working on it when I have time. I have been pulled to
another project and have been unable to work on it for the last
couple of months. I also have been working on the depca cards for
the ethernet so that has slowed me down alot. If I ever get it
working good I think I will try to use it at home. I am not into
packet at the moment but I may if I switch to
Linux.<span   class="bold"><b>-Joe WB4ARV</b></span></p><p>Alright, I'll bite! ;) While in college, I started to dream
of having my very own &ldquo;unix box&rdquo; to hack on for endless hours. The
thought of being able to do this *and* get to participate in the
evolution of a new OS was really exciting to me, and remains so to
this day, a couple years later!</p><p>There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that I have been able
to learn *so* much more about unix and PCs in general because of
the decision to run Linux on my own computer. I have been able to
contribute to portions of the OS in 1992 and early 1993, in the
form of initial ports of network clients, a BBS package, and
several X Windows games. I also established a free Linux-oriented
BBS in late 1992 which continues to flourish and present new
learning opportunities.</p><p>Ham Radio entered the equation this year, when I decided to
once again obtain a license, this time Technician. I operated CW as
a novice at the tende r age of nine years - fifth grade, and now
enjoy 2 meter rag-chewing, packet radio and *maybe*, CW. Someday.
When I get around to it again. ;) A small group of experimenters in
the Bay Area are architecting a high speed packet network. It uses
256 Kbps modems designed by a fellow at Stanford, and protocols by
a friend (Cliff Skolnick N1DPH) and myself. Mike Cheponis (K3MC) is
the mastermind behind the project. A mailing list is set up on my
machine (list is called &ldquo;speed-freaks&rdquo; - send mail to
<a href="mailto:listserv@hip-hop.sbay.org">listserv@hip-hop.sbay.org</a>
with &ldquo;help&rdquo; in the body for info).</p><p>It's coming along, albeit slowly, and we're experimenting
with some low-speed stuff right now. My Linux system talks to a 286
DOS box (running KA9Q) over ethernet, and from there out onto the
local TCP/IP network; the 286 functions as a router, and allows
access to network services on my Linux box from the ampr-net. Cliff
and I are eagerly awaiting the release of the Linux AX25 drivers to
try out and possibly integrate into our network software.</p><p>Hope you enjoyed reading this response to your post. I look
forward tohearing other Linux-using ham operators' stories as
well!<span   class="bold"><b>-Dave KE6AJC</b></span></p><p>Actually, the number of technical &ldquo;netters&rdquo; in *any* field
who are hams is rather amazing.</p><p>++Brandon (JNOS Linux port, and if I ever get time I'll
finish up some enhancements to XSat that make it almost worth
using)</p><p>--... ...-- -.. . -.- ..-. ---.. -. .... ...-.-</p><p>[in English, 73 de KF8NH&mdash;boy is morse code hard to read like

because I wanted a REAL multitasking OS for my computer. I was
already familiar with UNIX, so I found Linux to be an ideal choice
for my needs.<span   class="bold"><b>-Andrew WQ3S</b></span></p><p>I got into Linux because I wanted a real Unix and it was
free, and nowadays its free and better. I'm currently running a

hacked).<span   class="bold"><b>- Alan Cox</b></span></p><p>Well, count me in. I've been keen on Unix from the git-go,
but it always seemed to be out of my reach for hobby use until
Coherent. When Linux reached ~pl12, I jumped in; never looked
back.</p><p>One of these days RSN, I hope to start using Linux for some
ham applications, but that's somewhere down in the queue. OTOH, it
seems that I'm having so much fun dinking with Linux that the ham
gear is gathering quite a coat of dust.<span   class="bold"><b>-John
N4VU</b></span></p><p>I am N2VKD, just got my technician's license in June. Have
been playing with Linux on my 386/20 for about a year now. Running
packet radio here in New York City under Linux is one of the
reasons I got my ticket. So, sometime in the coming year, I hope to
get the radio gear and tnc that will best work with Linux. I joined
AMSAT too, that big bird they are going to send up sounds exciting.
Overall, I think Linux and Ham Radio will be great together, with
both being the better from the merge.<span   class="bold"><b>-Jim
N2VKD</b></span></p><p>I've been involved with Linux since 0.12. I work in data
networking, and am an active packet radio operator. I am
co-administrator of the Sydney amprnet tcp/ip Wormhole gateway. I
have a strong interest in computing too, and for me, Linux is
ideal, allowing me to meld my radio and computing hobbies into a
single series of projects.<span   class="bold"><b>-Terry

equipment, but I am setting up my Linux PC for it
now.<span   class="bold"><b>-John KD4UBM</b></span></p><p>My call is DL4YBG, name is Mark and QTH is Berlin/Germany. It
was much fun working on a homebrew CP/M-system, because you could
create your own system and built your own hardware. All this fun
was gone when using MSDOS... LINUX with its complete sourcecode and
kernel-hacking brought back the fun to
computing...<span   class="bold"><b>-Mark DL4YBG</b></span></p><p>Finally, my turn. I have been a ham for over 30 years and
have always been on the experimenter end. Even build a remote base
station when I was still in high school. I see Linux as another
chance to experiment and hope to get Linux and ham packet plugged
in together.<span   class="bold"><b>-Phil WA6SWR</b></span></p></div></div>
