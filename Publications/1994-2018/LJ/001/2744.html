structures. Virtually every aspect of our lives is structured in
some way, be it socially, politically, religiously&mdash;you name it.
Rules are hard and fast. Everything has a proper place.</p><p>This is especially true of the computing community, no doubt
because computers themselves are highly structured, deterministic
beasts. Large software development corporations employ scores of
programmers into hierarchies so deep that the lowest-level
employees are often lost in the carpeting. Every position has one
or more obscure titles ranging from &ldquo;Manager&rdquo; to &ldquo;Submanager&rdquo; to
&ldquo;Peon&rdquo;, often including secret code-names for the particular
project at hand, to thwart the copycat tendencies of competing
corporations.</p><p>This organization extends well beyond the physical and social
world, as well&mdash;electronic files, networking protocols, and even
USENET newsgroups are arranged into hierarchies. Hierarchies can be
real, virtual, or purely imaginary. They're everywhere. And this is
all intended, I'm sure, to teach us a very good lesson: Nothing in
the Real World gets done without a strong sense of teamwork and
strict organization. Nothing!</p><p>Well, almost nothing. The Linux development community is a
seemingly unstructured, amorphous conglomerate. There is no single
leader, or nucleus, for the organization. No single entity can
claim responsibility for Linux. Each of the many parts of the Linux
system, from individual kernel source files to entire
distributions, are copyrighted by different individuals. In fact,
it looks like a big mess. Or is the Linux development cabal as
disorganized as it seems?</p><p>The Linux development community grew, like crystals, around a
solitary kernel (no pun intended). Linus Torvalds was, in the
beginning, singly responsible for the kernel development, back when
the kernel itself was thought of as the entirety of Linux. In more
recent times, however, Linus claims he authored less than 50% of
the current kernel code. So, while Linus may be the &ldquo;father&rdquo; of
this rapidly growing amoeba, very few people would assign him the
title of &ldquo;leader&rdquo;&mdash;all due respect, of course.</p><p>But that's ancient history. It's more instructive, I think,
to look at how the Linux community <span   class="emphasis"><em>appears</em></span> to
work now. The community seems to be essentially a huge network of
individuals, all working towards a single goal (or many goals, as
the case may be). In fact, Linux development is not unlike
guerrilla warfare, wherein every member of a small, seemingly
disorganized political faction has more or less the same idea of
what the overall goal is, but each individual may have his or her
own ideas about how to go about it.</p><p>Within this gargantuan bee colony, it is difficult to make
out any direct or intentional hierarchy among the developers, but
there does seem to be a metaphysical hierarchy of sorts&mdash;a &ldquo;caste&rdquo;
system which isn't enforced externally, but instead stems from
within the community itself. This hierarchy is more a handy
convention than a definite rule. Guerrilla troops are tied together
by a similarly complex system of blood ties, tenure, and the
occasional vendetta. But the driving force behind it all is a
shared vision of the world (or the operating system) to become.
Basic human natures fills in the rest.</p><p>What is this hierarchy? Most members of the Linux community
observe a straightforward split between &ldquo;developers&rdquo; and
&ldquo;non-developers&rdquo;. It's not always clear who is a developer and who
isn't, and what gives someone the right to call themselves a
developer is equally as muddy. But it seems obvious that some kind
of ladder does exist. Finding the rungs is another matter
altogether.</p><p>On the lowest level, it would seem, is the myriad of Linux
users. These range from the extremely intelligent to the utterly
clueless, but on the whole, the &ldquo;users&rdquo; don't contribute to the
growth of Linux, beyond the occasional bug report or helping hand
to another of their kind. Of course, such a claim is purely
bogus&mdash;in fact, Linux users contribute to the expansion of Linux
just by using it. The more popular and widespread the system is,
the more flexible it has to be. Nevertheless this is an indirect
effect of propagation, and while individual users may not be able
to directly shape the system, the user community as a whole
contributes an essential aspect of Linux just through its
existence. (Waxing philosophical again, am I? Don't say we didn't
warn you.)</p><p>On the highest level of this quasi-taxonomy are the
&ldquo;developers&rdquo; who actually program and support the system. They make
the most noticeable direct influence on the furtherance of Linux
itself, but as is the case with the user community described above,
the wide disarray of differing development goals lends itself to
another form of &ldquo;meta-development&rdquo;. The seemingly uncontrollable
patchwork of many independent development efforts, all reduced and
squeezed into a single package, gives Linux a kind of spirit
and&mdash;I'm not afraid to use the word&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>charm</em></span> not
found in other operating systems.</p><p>Whereas commercial UNIX systems smack of being &ldquo;developed by
committee&rdquo;, Linux actually resembles software that has been
developed by a madhouse. UNIX kernel development is deluged with
black magic, obfuscation, obsolescence, and such sheer complexity
that it's a wonder that programmers who, for the most part, have
never met face-to-face can get anything done at all. Not to mention
the obvious troubles arising from the language barrier and the
inherent limitations of electronic mail.</p><p>Yet, at the core (no pun intended) of this crazy mishmash of
conflicting programming models and conventions a pearl has emerged.
Not only has Linux managed to survive the rough seas of early
development, but it has snowballed into a colossal collaborative
development effort by people from all walks of life. Everyone has
the chance to contribute, no matter how insignificantly. Linux is
developed by and for its users, not for some arbitrary third-party
target market that commercial UNIX vendors attempt to cater to. If
Linux reeks of hackishness that is because its users (and thus its
developers) are hackers. Of course, non-hackers are eager to jump
onto the bandwagon as well, and the first to do so have the
opportunity to steer it in that direction for others to
follow.</p><p>So it doesn't seem to make much sense to classify the Linux
community into some kind of ladder or scale, even with Linus at the
top and J. Random User at the bottom. Each member of the community
has his or her own personal niche and potential for contribution.
The only difference is the amount of effort that each person puts
in. (For some, it takes a great deal of effort
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to hack Linux, but that's another story.)
Age, race, sex, and planetary origin are completely irrelevant.
It's attitude that matters&mdash;and everyone has their own
attitude.</p><p>What this all comes down to is this: You can look at the
Linux community in any way that you please. Some prefer to see it
as a ladder by ranking the members based on knowledge, aptitude,
contribution, or other such intangible qualities for which there
are more exceptions than rules. Others envision a flat hierarchy in
which everyone is equal in a utopian technocratic society. Others,
like myself, visualize a giant cocktail party gone madly awry. Who
are you going to believe?</p><p>One thing is for certain, however. The Linux development
guerrilla troops are effecting their programming and political aims
no matter how disorganized they may appear to be. Linux is
spreading like wildfire in the dry, ready-to-burn forests of the
commercial UNIX market, determined to devastate anything in its
path. &sect;</p><p>We came. We saw. We hacked.</p></div></div>
