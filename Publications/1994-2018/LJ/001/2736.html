    Linus (rhymes with shyness) Torvalds (author of the Linux
    kernel) traded email with us for several days in January
    giving us his views on the future direction of Linux (rhymes
    with clinics) and his ongoing role in its development.

chance to do it all again, what changes would he make in Unix. He
said he would add an e to the creat system call.
</p><p>How about you and Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus:</b></span> Well, Considering how
well it has turned out, I really can't say something went wrong: I
have done a few design mistakes, and most often those have required
re-writing code (sometimes only a bit, sometimes large chunks) to
correct for them, but that can't be avoided when you don't really
know all the problems</p><p>If it's something I have problems with, it's usually the
interface between user-level programs and the kernel: kernel-kernel
relations I can fix easily in one place, but when I notice that the
design of a system call is bad, changing that is rather harder, and
mostly involves adding a new system call which has semantics that
are the superset of the old and then leaving in a
compatibility-hack so that the old calls still work. Ugly, and I
avoid it unless it really has to be done.</p><p>Right now I'd actually prefer to change the semantics of the
and write() system calls subtly, but the gains aren't really worth
the trouble.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> The most
consistent compliment that Linux receives is its stability on Intel
PC computers. This is particularly true compared to &ldquo;real Unices&rdquo;
that have been ported to the Intel platform.</p><p>What do you see that was done right in Linux that is causing
problems for these other PC Unices?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus:</b></span> There are probably a
couple of reasons. One is simply the design, which is rather
simple, and naturally suits the PC architecture rather well. That
makes many things easier. I'd suspect that the other reason is due
to rather stable drivers: PC hardware is truly horrendous in that
there are lots of different manufacturers, and not all of them do
things the same (or even according to specs).</p><p>That results in major problems for anybody who needs to write
a driver that works on different systems, but in the case of linux
this is at least partially solved by reasonably direct access to a
large number of different machines. The development cycle of linux
helps find these hardware problems: with many small incremental
releases, it's much easier to find out exactly what piece of code
breaks/fixes some hardware. Other distributions (commercial or the
BSD 386-project which uses a different release schedule) have more
problems in finding out why something doesn't work on a few
machines even though it seems to work on all the others.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i></b></span>: Have you
heard of any problems running Linux on the Pentium chip? Do you
expect any?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus:</b></span> I know from a number
of reports that it works, and that the boot-up detection routines
even identify the chip as a Pentium (&ldquo;uname -a&rdquo; will give &ldquo;i586&rdquo;
with reasonably new kls, as I ignore Intel guidelines about the
name). The problems are not likely to occur due to the actual
processor itself, as much as with the surrounding hardware: with a
Pentium chip, manufacturers are much more likely to use more exotic
hardware controllers for better performance, and the drivers for
them all won't necessarily exist for linux yet. So I've had a few
reports of a Pentium PCI machine working fine, but that the kernel
then doesn't recognize the SCSI hard disk, for example.</p><p>From a performance viewpoint, the current gcc compiler isn't
able to do Pentium-specific optimizations, so sadly linux won't be
able to take full advantage of the processor right now. I don't
know when gcc will have Pentium-optimization support, but I expect
it will come eventually (most of the logic for it should already be
there, as gcc can already handle similar optimization problems for
other complex processors).</p><p>One interesting thing is that the &ldquo;bogo-mips&rdquo; loop I use to
calibrate a kernel timing loop seems to actually be slower on a
Pentium than on an i486 at the same clock frequency. The real-world
performance is probably better despite that (the timing loop is
just a decrement operation followed by a conditional jump: the
Pentium won't be able to do any super scalar execution
optimizations).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> With the end
of the road for Intel's 80XXX series chips in sight (although at
least a few years away), what chip or hardware platform would you
like to see Linux ported to?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus:</b></span> The Amiga 680x0
(x&gt;=3, MMU required) port is already underway and reportedly
mostly functional already. I haven't been in any close contact with
the developers, as they seem to know what they are doing, but I
understand they track the PC versions rather closely, and have most
of the features working. I'd expect something truly functional by
the end of this year, even though the installed machine base is
much smaller.</p><p>As to other ports: I'd really enjoy some port to newer and
more exotic hardware like the DEC Alpha chips or the PowerPC, but
as far as I know nobody is really working on it. The main problem
with non-i386 ports is simply lack of momentum: in order to get
this kind of port going, you'd need hacker-type people with access
to such hardware with &ldquo;nothing better&rdquo; to do on it. DEC or IBM has
yet to show enough interest that they'd donate hardware and
documentation to this worthwhile cause.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> What aspects
of Linux are you taking responsibility for on an on-going
basis?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus:</b></span> Everything that
directly concerns the kernel: some of it I can't actually fix
myself (mostly drivers for hardware I don't own and have no idea
about), but in that case I still want to know about the problems
and try to act as a &ldquo;router&rdquo; to the person who actually handles
that piece of code. The areas I consider especially &ldquo;mine&rdquo; are
memory management, the VFS layer and the &ldquo;kernel proper&rdquo;
(scheduling, interrupt handling etc). Generally things that make up
the very heart of the kernel, and on top of which all the other
stuff has to go.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> Do you see
yourself earning a living from your work in Linux in future?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus:</b></span> Well, I do hope and
expect to be able to find a job much more easily due to linux, so
yes, indirectly at least I hope to be able to make a living off
this, even though the work itself might be completely unrelated. As
to whether it would actually concern linux itself in some way, I
don't know</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> The use of
Linux is growing exponentially around the world. However, unlike
commercial products, there is no central registry for Linux
users.</p><p>What is your &ldquo;best guess&rdquo; of the number of machines ruing
Linux worldwide today and what would you base an estimate
on.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus:</b></span> I actually have no
good idea at all: I haven't really followed either the CD-ROM sales
or any ftp statistics, so it's rather hard to say. I guesstimate a
user base of about 50,000 active users: that may be way off-base,
but it doesn't sound too unlikely. The c.o.l. newsgroup had about
80,000 readers according to the network statistics back before the
split (and I haven't looked at the statistics since), and I saw a
number like 10,000 CD-ROMs sold somewhere. Not all of those are
active users, I'm sue, but that would put some kind of lower limit
on the number.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> Hindsight
being 20/20, do you occasionally wish you had patented, or
otherwise retained rights to Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus:</b></span> Definitely not. Even
with 20/20 hindsight, I consider the linux copyright to be one of
the very best design decisions I ever did, along with accepting
code that was copyrighted by other holders (under the same
copyright conditions, of course). I'm not fanatic about the GPL,
but in the case of linux it has certainly worked out well enough.
As to patents, I consider software patents a patently bad idea in
the first place, and even if I didn't, I would abhor the paperwork
needed. Getting a trade-mark on the name &ldquo;linux&rdquo; might be a good
idea, and there was some talk about that, but nobody really found
the thing important enough to bother about (especially as it does
require both some funds and work).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> What is your
field of study, and what do you plan to specialize in upon
graduation?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus:</b></span> I'm studying mostly
operating systems (surprise, surprise), and compiler design: rather
low-level stuff mostly. I expect I'll expand that to communications
and distributed systems for obvious reasons, but I haven't really
decided on anything yet. So far, my &ldquo;field&rdquo; has been any courses
that I find interesting, and I hope I won't have to specialize any
more than that in the future either.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> Linux is
benefiting from a worldwide development effort. The number and
frequency of new releases of Linux, and drivers and utilities are
amazing to anyone familiar with traditional UNIX development
cycles. This seems to be giving Linux a huge &ldquo;competitive
advantage&rdquo; over alternate UNIX-on-the-pc products.</p><p>What do you see as the future of Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus:</b></span> I rather expect it to
remain reasonably close to what it looks like now: the releases may
become a bit less frequent as it all stabilizes, but that might
just mean that I'll make my snapshots weekly instead of daily as I
do now during intense development, and that the &ldquo;real&rdquo; releases
will happen a couple of times a year instead of monthly or
bi-monthly as now.</p><p>Similarly, there will probably remain several different
&ldquo;package releases&rdquo;: some of them will be more or less commercial
(currently the Yggdrasil CD-ROM, for example, or the various disk
copying services), while others will continue to be mostly
electronically distributed by ftp.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> What would
you LIKE to see for the future of Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus:</b></span> Related to the
question above, I do hope to see one change: support and
documentation. Some of this has actually already happened or is
happening now, but there is still room for growth. I know of a few
book projects (one of which went into print a couple of days ago),
and a few support companies, and I hope that will still
grow.</p><p>Then there are various interesting projects going on that I'd
be very interested to see:</p><p>Windows emulation (being worked on, and the kernel support is
already there);i386 SysV binary compatibility (already in early
stages of testing) etc.;As well as the porting projects to various
different hardware platforms, of course.
</p><p>I also have various general (and vague) plans about actual
kernel development, and some specifics I want to have implemented
in the reasonably near future (I think I'll work mostly on memory
management and related areas this spring, for example). Mostly, I
just hope to have a stable and enjoyable platform</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> Also, would
you have a photo of yourself we could use to accompany the article?
This is by no means required, but a huge number of Linux users are
very curious about who you are, why you did Linux, etc... you know,
all the human interest side to the Linux story.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus:</b></span> I'm &ldquo; camera-shy&rdquo;,
so I have no good photos for this purpose, which has resulted in
some rather weird photos being used in some places. A magazine in
Holland used one of the gifs that were put out long ago (bad
quality, and very much done in jest: I drink beer in most of them,
including the one they used), and one Finnish magazine used a photo
from a party I was at which also had lots of beer-cans in it.. I
guess I should find some rather more presentable photos somewhere.
I'll see.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> We saw a
photo that was distributed over the net. One that has you smiling,
with a beer bottle in front subtitled `Linus Torvalds - creator of
Linux'&mdash;In fact, for all the `official' format for photos requires
a tie and at least a semi-serious pose, I think that this was a
VERY good photo, as it showed you as a happy, friendly human
being.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus:</b></span> It's another of the
`party photos', although the party was a much smaller and more
informal one. I don't know who has the originals anymore, so I'm
unlikely to find it in time with most of the concerned people still
being somewhere else as teaching at the university hasn't started
yet. What the magazine from Holland did was actually to have a
screen-shot of linux running X, and have the gif-picture in an xv
window (with a few other windows like xload to give it some more
lf); that way the quality of the picture didn't matter much, and it
also looked like a clever idea. You could use some similar trick. I
don't mind looking like a human being instead of a tie+shirt robot,
so I don't mind the picture even though it was all done mostly in
jest.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> We'd like to
send you a complimentary subscription(s) to <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus:</b></span> I'd like a copy,
please.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> Also, re your
response on the `other platforms' question, if you can find someone
willing to do the work, we should be able to help find someone at
IBM or HP (maybe even DEC, but I doubt SUN) who would be able to
donate/loan some hardware.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus:</b></span> It would be fun, but
as I can't make any promises and would need lots of technical
documentation as well (and not under any non-disclosure), this is
probably not really something companies like to do.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> Where did you
learn to write English this well?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus:</b></span> I read more English
than either Swedish (my mother tongue) or Finnish (which is the
majority language in Finland, of course), so I while I'm not
completely comfortable actually speaking the language (partly due
to pronunciation), I don't have any problems reading, writing or
indeed thinking in English.</p><p>The reason for reading English is simply that there are more
interesting books available in English, and that they are usually
cheaper even over here (larger printings, no translation costs,
etc.). Besides, it's often the original language, so even when the
book is available as a translation, I usually prefer to read it in
English.</p><p>This interview was conducted by Robert Young, Publisher of
the <i  >Linux Journal</i>, NY Unix.</p></div></div>
