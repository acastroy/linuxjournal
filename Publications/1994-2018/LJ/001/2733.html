    This is a general announcement of the imminent code-freeze that will
    hopefully make Linux 1.0 a reality.  The plan has been discussed a bit
    with various developers already, and is already late, but is still in
    effect otherwise.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x133a580.0x14321e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>In short, the next version of Linux
(0.99.15) will be a &ldquo;full-featured&rdquo; release, and only obvious
bug-fixes to existing features will be applied before calling it
1.0. If this means that your favourite feature or networking
version won't make it, don't despair: there is life even after beta
(and it's probably not worth mailing me about it any more: I've
seen quite a few favourite features already ;-).
</p><p>In fact, 1.0 has little &ldquo;real meaning&rdquo;, as far as development
goes, but should be taken as an indication that it can be used for
real work (which has been true for some time, depending on your
definition of &ldquo;real work&rdquo;). Development won't stop or even slow
down: some of it has even been shelved pending a 1.0
already.</p><p>Calling it 1.0 will not necessarily make all bugs go away
(quite the opposite, judging by some other programs), but I hope it
will be a reasonably stable release. In order to accomplish this,
the code-freeze after 0.99.15 will be about a month, and I hope
people will test out that kernel heavily, instead of waiting for
&ldquo;the real release&rdquo; so that any potential bugs can be found and
fixed.</p><p>As to where we are now: as of this moment, the latest release
is the `r' version of pl14 (aka &ldquo;ALPHA-pl14r&rdquo;). I've made ALPHA
releases available on ftp.funet.fi almost daily, and expect a final
pl15 within a few more days. Testing out the ALPHA releases is not
discouraged either if you like recompiling kernels every day or
two..</p><p>And finally: we also try to create a &ldquo;credits&rdquo; file that
mentions the developers of the kernel and essential Linux
utilities. The credit file compilator is
<a href="mailto:jmartin@opus.starlab.csc.com">jmartin@opus.starlab.csc.com</a>
(John A. Martin), and if you feel you have cause to be mentioned in
it, please contact him.</p></div></div>
