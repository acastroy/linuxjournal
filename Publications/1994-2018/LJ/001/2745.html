    The quick review is &ldquo;if you plan to run Linux you must have this book&rdquo;.
    This book is a product of the Linux Documentation Project and Matt Welsh
    is the coordinator of that project.  What may sound strange is that this
    book is free but, once you understand the spirit of the Linux community,
    it makes sense.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1973580.0x1a6b298"></a></h2></div></div><p>Matt released version 1 of this book in
August, 1993. Version 2 was just made available on January 14,
1994. The major revision was to make it generic for most any Linux
distribution. The previous edition was somewhat specific to the SLS
distribution.
</p><p>The following appears on the cover of the book and is a
reasonable explanation of why the book exists and who should read
it.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;This book is an installation and new-user guide
for the Linux system, meant for UNIX novices and gurus alike.
Contained herein is information on how to obtain Linux,
installation of the software, a beginning tutorial for new UNIX
users, and an introduction to system administration. It is meant to
be general enough to be applicable to any distribution of the Linux
software. Anyone with interest in installing and running Linux
should read this book first.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>The book starts with an introduction to Linux including
history, features, design and hardware requirements. The next
chapter covers obtaining and installing Linux. How to get Linux
from the Internet as well as other sources is covered. The section
on installation problems covers many if not most of the questions
that are regularly asked on the Linux newsgroups on Usenet.</p><p>The third chapter is a Linux tutorial. While not differing
much from a standard Unix tutorial it covers the basics that a
newcomer to Linux (or Unix) will need to know. It starts very basic
but covers pipes, wildcards, file permissions, job control and the
vi editor.</p><p>Systems administration is covered which includes routine
stuff as well as disaster recovery. The final chapter is an
introduction to the advanced features of Linux including X Windows,
TCP/IP networking, E-mail and Usenet news.</p><p>Appendices cover other documentation, linux distributions, a
Linux BBS list where you can get Linux files and even a tutorial on
using ftp to get Linux off the Internet.</p><p>All in all, a thorough job of writing what needs to be said
to get people started. If I had to find shortcomings it would be in
the appendices talking about other sources of information and Linux
distributions. The other books list mentions quite a few of the
O'Reilly books (which are Unix-specific) but leave out what I would
consider important books such as <span   class="emphasis"><em>The UNIX Programming
Environment</em></span> by Kernighan and Pike (Prentice-Hall),
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The UNIX System</em></span> by Stephen Bourne
(Addison-Wesley), <span   class="emphasis"><em>Introducing the UNIX System</em></span>
by Henry McGilton and Rachael Morgan (McGraw-Hill) and SSC's series
of Unix pocket references and tutorials. The list of distributions
covers MCC, TAMU, Nascent, Slackware and Trans-Ameritech but leave
out major players such as Yggdrasil. Also, the information on
Slackware is out of date but, as the change only happened 30 days
ago, I can't be overly critical.</p><p>The final word: well worth the price which, as I mentioned is
free if you have Internet access. It can be found on SunSite
(<b  >sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/LDP/install-guide</b>)
as well as all the other standard mirror sites. It is available as
LaTeX source, a dvi file and in PostScript. If you don't have
Internet access (or just would rather buy paper) SSC has agreed to
make a comb bound copy available for $15 plus shipping ($3 in the
U.S.).E-mail
