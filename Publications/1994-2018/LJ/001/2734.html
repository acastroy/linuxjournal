    We continue to see media blurbs and ads for both Microsoft's Windows NT
    and
    IBM's OS/2. Both promise to be the operating system that we need and to
    take advantages of the capabilities of the Intel 386 and beyond. In the
    mean time, development and use of Linux, another system that takes
    advantage of these capabilities, lumbers along. In this article, Bernie
    Thompson explores these as three alternatives to just staying with what
    you
    have.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fc580.0x29f42f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Picking an operating system is a
dangerous business. You're committing yourself to a couple hours,
certainly, or maybe a couple days of manual-reading, file-editing,
and hassles. If your real goal was just to get some work done,
maybe it would have been simpler to stay with Windows 3.1 and never
embark on an adventure in computing.
</p><p>But, then again, there seems to be a substantial body of
computer users who are dissatisfied with DOS and Windows. Some are
moving to OS/2, Windows NT, or some other Comdex wonder. Some are
even daring enough to wipe out DOS in favor of an
anti-establishment system like Linux.</p><p>Before you take the plunge, you should know up front what you
stand to gain. More importantly, too, what you stand to lose.
Here's what lies ahead for you if you want OS/2, Windows NT, or
Linux to be part of your future.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fc580.0x29f44a8"></a>Hardware is the First Issue</h2></div></div><p>Don't even think about switching systems until you know what
your hardware supports. The wonderful features of a new system
won't be compelling if your system doesn't work.</p><p>You must have a Intel 386 or better to have any 32-bit
choices. Then you need memory. Linux needs 2MB RAM to try out, OS/2
needs 4MB, and NT needs 12 MB. And you need disk space. You need to
set aside at least 15MB for Linux, 32MB for OS/2, and 70MB for NT
for a good trial run. A full working system will require even more
resources.</p><p>If these requirements are satisfied, you still have to
determine if all the pieces of your machine are compatible. If your
machine uses the Microchannel bus (all IBM PS/2s), Linux doesn't
support you. If you have a Compaq QVision video board, OS/2 won't
use it. If you have a network card with a 3Com 3c501 chip, NT can't
talk to it. And these are just samples of some possible
compatibility problems. The full list changes often.
Incompatibilities constantly recede as better hardware support is
added. But a constant stream of new, incompatible hardware is
always hitting the market.</p><p>Why are computer users put through this ringer? Well, The PC
hardware market has few solid standards. IBM-compatible hasn't
really meant anything since IBM stopped leading the industry. These
nightmares can be avoided by getting your 32-bit operating system
the same way you got DOS and Windows&mdash;buy a complete computer
system with Linux, OS/2 or NT pre-installed. Companies which do
this are rare, but you'll save trouble by seeking one out. Let them
find the best hardware to fit the operating system you want.</p><p>If buying a whole new system isn't an option, you'll have to
take the path most Linux, OS/2, and NT users have taken. Just start
installing. If you have trouble, be prepared to find out more than
you ever wanted to know about the pieces of your system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fc580.0x29f4710"></a>Why Operating Systems Matter</h2></div></div><p>Operating systems determine which applications will work,
what those applications will look like, and how they will work
together.</p><p>For example, if you want to run Microsoft's application suite
(Word, Excel, Access, and PowerPoint), you're out of luck with
Linux. They won't work. With OS/2, they work for now, but the
burden is on IBM to keep up since Microsoft abandoned OS/2 in 1991.
In the end, Windows 3.1 and Windows NT are the only safe choices
for using Microsoft applications.</p><p>How applications look and how they work together are
determined by the operating system, too.</p><p><a href="2734f1.jpg" target="_self">Table 1. Disk Space
Required</a></p><p>Windows NT uses the same program manager&mdash;file manager&mdash;print
manager interface as Windows 3.1. This interface is not elegant,
but it has one very significant advantage&mdash;it is simple. And
because it's not very configurable, users can't do much damage by
moving icons around and changing settings.</p><p>OS/2 takes the more radical route of a completely object
oriented interface. Data and programs are objects which can be
arranged in any manner. Clicking on a data object starts the
associated application. Dragging data to the printer object prints
it. Although OS/2 has a notoriously bland color scheme and layout
when first installed, every detail can be re-configured.</p><p>With OS/2's flexibility comes a daunting depth of detail for
first-time users. It is too easy to get lost. With dozens of
windows open, it's a pain to locate and manipulate things. However,
these disadvantages fade when the system is used for a while. The
detail, power, and regularity of the interface become
persuasive.</p><p>Linux uses the X/Windows system. X/Windows is a graphical
chameleon, able to look and act many ways. The advantage is
flexibility and choice. The disadvantage is complexity.
Applications may not look and act alike. Many different interfaces
are available. This makes user instruction and support more
difficult.</p><p>Linux is primarily a command-line system where programs are
typed in by name, although program managers and file managers are
available to ease the transition of a novice user. The same tasks
done with Windows and OS/2 are possible under Linux, but they
generally require more knowledge and skills. If one knowledgeable
user configures the Linux system, most novice users will be
comfortable starting and running applications.</p><p><a href="2734f2.jpg" target="_self">Table 2. Features
Required</a></p><p>All three systems have a wide variety of books and tutorials
available which can help novice users. Although Linux is a free
system, it still has a library of books written about it&mdash;any book
about Unix will apply to Linux. So finding assistance on the use of
these systems should not be difficult.</p><p>If the issues of interface are surmountable, Linux has many
positive characteristics that are not shared by OS/2 and NT. Linux
enjoys the advantage of having no guarded secrets, no technology
owned by a single company. The source code is freely available,
which means it can be inspected and improved upon by any corporate
or individual user. And, surprisingly, this common knowledge was
used to build a system which is more miserly with memory and disk
space than either OS/2 or NT. IBM and Microsoft would actually have
much to learn from Linux if they cared to look.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fc580.0x29f4c90"></a>The Foundations</h2></div></div><p>When it comes down to it, an operating system is just a
foundation. Choose the foundation that supports the features you
need and will need in the future. But be aware of the high price in
memory, storage, and performance that these features exact.</p><p>Linux, like OS/2, is designed and optimized to run on Intel
386 and compatible CPUs. By contrast, Windows NT is designed to be
ported to many different CPUs. NT is currently available for MIPS,
DEC Alpha, and Intel 386. This independence from Intel is an
important advantage for NT, because users have more hardware
choices.</p><p>All three systems support multitasking, which is the ability
to have many programs running simultaneously. For example, it is
possible to format a disk, download a file from a BBS, and edit in
a word processor, all simultaneously. You can't do this using a
system like MS DOS, which doesn't support multitasking.</p><p>NT supports multiprocessing, which means using more than one
CPU in a single machine. An NT PC could have 2 or more processors,
all working together. Again, this means more hardware possibilities
for the NT user.</p><p>NT and Linux both support dynamic caching. Caching stores
recently used information in memory, so it is readily available if
needed again. OS/2 sets aside a pre-determined chunk of memory to
do this (typically 512K to 2MB), whereas Linux and NT will
dynamically use as much spare memory as possible. The result is
much faster disk access for Linux and NT, because the information
is often already in the cache. OS/2's inflexibility causes memory
to be wasted when not used, and memory to be used poorly when it is
scarce.</p><p>Linux, unlike OS/2 and NT, has full multiuser support. Local
users, modem users, and network users can all simultaneously run
text and graphics programs. This is a powerful feature for business
environments that is unmatched by OS/2 or NT.</p><p><a href="2734f3.jpg" target="_self">Table 3. Memory
Required</a></p><p>Linux has security systems to prevent normal users from
misconfiguring the system. Although Windows NT isn't multiuser, it
has security checks for the individual using the machine. It is
safe to have a Linux or NT machine available for use by many
people, whereas an OS/2 user could (mis)configure the system
software.</p><p>Linux's security and multiuser features are so well developed
because they are traditional features for Unix. Since Linux is
&ldquo;Unix-compatible,&rdquo; it supports these same powerful features.</p><p><a href="2734f4.jpg" target="_self">Table 4. Applications
Supported</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fc580.0x29f5160"></a>The Costs</h2></div></div><p>Every feature supported will tend to make an operating system
larger, consuming more memory and storage. Larger systems are also
slower than smaller systems when memory is scarce. So the size of a
system is an important issue.</p><p>NT is the largest of the three systems. NT's support for
portability, multiprocessing, and many other features is the cause
of its large size. Given a powerful enough machine, NT offers a set
of features that is very compelling.</p><p>Linux with X/Windows is the next smaller system. Linux itself
is very miserly, but X/Windows puts a burden on the system. For
most the graphical interface will be worth the cost in
resources.</p><p>OS/2 is smallest of the three when using a graphical
interface. This is the attraction of OS/2. A user need only upgrade
to 8MB of RAM to use an object-oriented interface and have a good
platform for multitasking DOS, Windows, and OS/2 programs. OS/2 is
the strongest of the three for backward compatability with DOS and
Windows. OS/2 has sold several million copies in the last two
years, primarily because of these strengths.</p><p>Linux without X/Windows is the smallest of the three. This is
a great sacrifice for many, running without graphical windows. But
by jettisoning expensive graphics, the system is smaller and faster
than OS/2 or NT will ever be. 4MB RAM, the standard configuration
for a DOS/Windows PC, is plenty for most tasks. So Linux can make
good use of a low-end 386 PC with little memory, where OS/2 or NT
either would not run, or not run well. Systems with lots of memory
will be able to use Linux's dynamic caching to achieve unusually
high performance. With 16MB RAM, almost 12MB remains to be used for
caching and running applications.</p><p>In general, the issue of size is a great strength for Linux.
Linux was designed to be as small and efficient as possible. NT's
most important criterion was portability, and OS/2's was backward
compatibility. The result is Linux is the most efficient of the
three. And because a company or individual has access to the Linux
code, it can be optimized and scaled to suit the hardware and needs
of the user. OS/2 and NT do not have this flexibility.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fc580.0x29f5420"></a>The Practical Results</h2></div></div><p>Windows NT is compelling because it is a solid system that
offers freedom from the single CPU Intel world.</p><p>OS/2 is compelling because it offers the best system for
running 16-bit DOS and Windows applications while moving into the
more flexible and powerful 32-bit world.</p><p><a href="2734f5.jpg" target="_self">Table 5. Cost</a></p><p>But both systems still end up locking users into proprietary
technology&mdash;applications that will only work on either OS/2 or NT.
Linux does not pose this danger. Applications written for Linux can
be ported to any of the dozens of other Unix systems available.
Betting on an &ldquo;open&rdquo; technology from IBM or Microsoft is still a
risky game. Linux offers freedom from this kind of
entrapment.</p><p>The greatest difficulty in realizing this freedom is finding
high quality applications. To keep from getting locked into a
proprietary system, you have to choose applications with support
for multiple platforms. If your spreadsheet supports Windows, OS/2,
Unix, and Mac, you can be confident that support for additional
platforms would also be possible. The trade-off is fewer features
and higher prices.</p><p>Linux has an interface to run commercial applications
designed for other Intel Unix systems like SCO Unix. But the
quality of applications is still a problem. For example, there is
no commercial word processor for Linux which matches the quality of
ones for Windows and OS/2. This kind of glaring inadequacy alone
can preclude the use of Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fc580.0x29f5738"></a>Which System to Use</h2></div></div><p>For the corporate user, Linux will fit in well with a TCP/IP
based client-server strategy. Linux can turn low-end hardware into
a solid fileserver or PostScript print server. Linux works better
than many commercial Unix systems on common Intel hardware. Linux
is small and fast. Linux can be completely inspected and customized
by anyone. Linux has built-in mail and internet tools. Phone
support and documentation for Linux are available.</p><p>But there are three disadvantages. One, there are few
commercial applications. Two, if something goes wrong, there is no
one organization to blame as with OS/2 or NT. Three, Linux's
foundations are strong, but Microsoft and IBM are constantly
developing new technologies that may leave Linux behind. In
general, Linux has the features to make it a better choice than NT
or OS/2 in some situations. As Linux gains exposure, more
businesses are likely to take advantage of this potential.</p><p>For the technical user, Linux offers the exciting chance to
tinker with an operating system. All of the system's source code is
available. It is a great learning tool and motivator. And since
most current Linux users are technical hobbyists, a wealth of
applications are available to suit these tastes. Ray tracers,
morphing programs, graphics viewers, compilers, games, and more are
all available. Linux does lack full-motion video, speech
recognition, and some other cutting-edge technologies. These
features, along with OS/2 and NT application development, may be
compelling enough to draw the technical user towards OS/2 or
NT.</p><p>For the novice user, OS/2 or NT is the best 32-bit option.
OS/2's object-oriented interface and free technical support are
compelling factors. NT's power to sway commercial developers is
reassuring. But the safest and most likely choice for the novice
user is to stick with the operating system that came with their
computer, typically DOS and Windows 3.1. Tackling installation,
configuration, and new applications is still not trivial for these
three 32-bit systems.</p><p>Overall, Linux stacks up surprisingly well for a free system
developed by a horde of volunteer programmers. It's foundations are
solid. The quantity and quality of many free applications are
stunning. If Windows-class applications and an OS/2-class interface
are developed for Linux, it will have the compelling features to
tackle commercial systems. While many computer users now know only
OS/2 and NT, thousands of others have discovered Linux. As all
three of these systems quickly improve and evolve, Linux is likely
to gain an expanding base of users. Free software has a powerful
new platform to build on.</p></div></div>
