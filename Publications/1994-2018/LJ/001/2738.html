    In this first part of a three part article, Frank and Karel explore their
    motivation for writing a new programming &ldquo;make tool&rdquo;, the organization of
    the system itself and where you can get a copy. Part 2 of the article will
    cover the icmake grammer and the final part will show examples of its use.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c5580.0x14bd6b8"></a>Introduction</h2></div></div><p>Icmake was developed initially as a make-tool to be used
under MS-DOS. Although make-utilities under MS-DOS exist, we tended
not to use these utilities for a two main reasons:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Since our primary language is C (C++), we
considered the grammar of the make utilities awkward.</p></li><li><p>In a program development cycle in which sources are
compiled, included in a library, which is then linked to a main
object module we experienced problems in setting up the correct
dependencies between files.</p></li></ol></div><p>Once icmake was developed, it was soon thereafter ported to
UNIX, where it now not only serves as our make-utility of choice.
However, by now it also serves as a utility with which we find it
easy to write shell-scripts.</p><p>Currently icmake has been ported to several UNIX platforms,
such as LINUX, SCO-UNIX, HP-UX, and SunOS. Icmake, therefore,
reflects almost perfectly the transition from DOS to UNIX we
experienced ourselves: developed initially under MS-DOS, it has now
become primarily a UNIX tool. But then, we used the `tools of the
trade', already under MS-DOS: both bison and flex were used for the
construction of the icmake compiler icm-comp. The first version of
icmake was available after some nine days, including the decisions
we had to take about what form it should take. Since we were also
working with some UNIX platforms (SunOS and AIX) by that time, the
`porting daemon' started to influence our implementation descisions
as well. The first port of icmake to a unix operatingsystem took
only a few days, which time was mainly invested in porting some
specific MS-DOS functions to an acceptable UNIX form.</p><p>In this article we describe icmake from the point of view of
its users. The organization of the software, the grammar of icmake
files, icmake-scripts and -to start with-the way to obtain icmake
is described in the remainder of this article. At the end some
illustrative examples of icmake-scripts are given.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c5580.0x14bda80"></a>2. Obtaining Icmake</h2></div></div><p>Icmake can be obtained by anonymous ftp from the site
beatrix.icce.rug.nl, where it is found in the directory
<b  >pub/unix</b>.</p><p>The package consists of an archive, usually in the form
icmake-X.XX.tar.gz, where the current version of icmake is denoted
by X.XX. This archive contains a tarred and gzipped directory
structure, in which the source files for icmake (and the executable
programs for MS-DOS) can be found. Also at beatrix.icce.rug.nl the
file icmake.doc can be be found, which is a guide to the
installation of icmake. This latter file is especially useful for
UNIX installations.</p><p>Alternatively, icmake can also be found at tsx-11.mit.edu,
where it is part of the Linux Operating System distribution. At
tsx-11.mit.edu the icmake-files are usually located in
pub/linux/sources/usr.bin.</p><p>Apart from the source-distribution and the installation guide
there is a icmake.dvi file available at beatrix.icce.rug.nl
describing icmake in somewhat more detail than is possible in this
article. Also, a postscript version (icmake.ps) of the
documentation is available.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c5580.0x14bdce8"></a>The Organization of the Software.</h2></div></div><p>Icmake consists of five programs. One program is a nitor
program, monitoring the construction and execution of an icmake
file. The monitor program may call an icmake preprocessor, an
icmake compiler and an icmake executor. A fifth program is the
icmake unassembler, showing the code generated by the icmake
compiler in a human-readable form.</p><p>The programs can be divided in two categories: programs of
which the ordinary user of icmake must be aware (the top-level
programs) and programs which are called internally by icmake (the
nested-level programs). The top-level programs are the
icmake-monitor program and the icmake unassembler. Normally, only
the monitor program is started at the command line, but programs of
the nested-level are sometimes called explicitly. All icmake
programs can be started as stand-alone programs.</p><p>The normal processing of an icmake script runs as
follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>An icmake source script is written, containing a
description of the tasks to be performed by icmake. This script is
very C-like.</p></li><li><p>The monitor is started, receiving the name of the
file containing the icmake source script as its argument.</p></li><li><p>The monitor program may call the icmake
preprocessor and the icmake compiler to convert the source file in
a binary file to be processed by the icmake executor.</p></li><li><p>The icmake executor is started by the monitor. The
executor reads the compiled icmake script, executing the
instructions found in the compiled script.</p></li></ol></div><p>Once an icmake-script has beenompiled, the compilation and
preprocessing phases are skipped by the monitor program, and the
icmake executor is called immediately. In this way icmake monitors
its own dependency between the icmake source script and the
compiled icmake script.</p><p>Each of the programs of the icmake family has a version
number. The version numbers consist of a major and a minor number.
E.g., in the version number 6.03, the major version is 6 and the
minor version is 03. The programs can only communicate when the
major version numbers of all icmake programs are equal. So a
working set of programs must all have the same major version
number. The minor number is used to indicate small changes in the
separate programs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c5580.0x14be268"></a>3.1. The top-level programs.</h2></div></div><p>At the top-level of icmake two programs are found. icmake
itself and icmun. The program `icmake' is the monitor program,
monitoring the execution of anicmake-script. The program `icmun' is
an unassembler, showing the contents of the compiled icmake script
in a human-readable form. Normally, icmun is not used: it serves
mainly as a debugging tool (although we've used icmun also for
instructional purposes, showing people some basic notions of
assembly-language programming).</p><p>Icmake</p><p>The icmake program monitors the execution of an icmake
script, and acts therefore as an interface between the user and
nested-level icmake programs. Normally, the nested-level icmake
programs are not started explicitly at the command-line, but are
called by icmake itself.</p><p><a href="2738l1.html" target="_self">ICCE Make Utility Version
6.00</a></p><p>Icmake may be invoked unsing one of the two following command
lines:</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>icmake</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>[flags]
asciifile [binaryfile] [arguments]</em></span></p><p>or</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>icmake</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>[flags] -i
asciifile [arguments]</em></span></p><p>The two invocation modes differ in the fact that the first
invocation (without the <span   class="bold"><b>i</b></span> flag)
makes it possible to specify explicitly the name of the compiled
icmake file (the &ldquo;binaryfile&rdquo;). The second mode uses a predefined
name for the compiled icmake file. In this form the name of the
asciifile is used, having the extension &ldquo;.bim&rdquo;.</p><p>With both invocation modes the &ldquo;flags&rdquo;, the two consecutive
hyphens and the arguments are optional. The arguments are passed to
the makefile and can be inspected there. The flags are used for
requesting specific actions of icmake. The specification of the
asciifile is obligatory in both invocations: this file is the make
script, which is interpreted by icmake and defines the actions to
be performed.</p><p>Whenever program from the icmake-family is started without
arguments, a help summary is displayed.</p><p>When icmake is activated without any arguments, the help
shows among other things the flags which are recognized by icmake.
In that case, something like the following table below will appear
on the screen:</p><p>The following flags are recognized:</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>-b</b></span>. When this flag is used,
no recency test is performed. Rather, the binary make file is
executed immediately `as is'. When this flag is absent, icmake
compiles the input file (.im file) into a binary file (.bim file)
if the input file is more recent.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>-c</b></span>. When this flag is used,
the ascii input file is compiled to a binary makefile, but is not
executed. The compilation occurs irrespective to the recency of the
input file and the binary file.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>-i</b></span> file. This option
specifies file as the input file for icmake and stops the further
processing of the arguments. In this case the nam of the binary
makefile (.bim file) is equal to the name of the input file
receiving the extension .bim. The default input file extension,
.im, is not supplied by icmake when this flag is given: the
specified name is taken literally.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>-p</b></span>. When this option is
used, only the icmake preprocessor is activated. The output of the
preprocessor is sent to a file having the same name as the input
file, but having the extension .pim. When this flag is absent,
icmake's preprocessor still generates a .pim file. However, this
file is deleted after the compilation-phase.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>-q</b></span>. When this option is
used, icmake operates quietly. I.e., the copyright banner is not
displayed.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>--</b></span>. By default, the first
non-flag argument on the command line is the input file, for which
the extension .im is assumed. When a second non-flag argument is
given, then this name is used for the binary file (.bim file). The
processing of arguments stops only when two consecutive hyphens are
encountered. All arguments which follow the&mdash;flag can be
inspected by the icmake-file.</p><p>Note that the&mdash;flag is not required when icmake is
activated with the -i flag.</p><p>The asciifile specification is obligatory. This is the icmake
source file which will be compiled and tested by icmake. Icmake
assumes a default extension <span   class="bold"><b>.im</b></span>.
E.g., the command line:</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>icmake test</b></span> will activate
icmake to process the icmake sourcefile test.im. Note however that
the command line:</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>icmake -i test</b></span> will start
icmake to process the makefile test. The presence of the -i flag
prevents icmake from supplying an extension.</p><p>The binaryfile specification is optional. When given, icmake
uses this file as the binary intermediate file in the process of
making. Extension <span   class="bold"><b>.bim</b></span> is the
default. By default icmake uses the basename of the asciifile and
extension <span   class="bold"><b>.bim</b></span>.</p><p>Following the binaryfile specification, several arguments to
the makefile itself may be given. However, before any extra
arguments are specified two consecutive hyphens are needed.
Following these hyphens extra arguments may follow which will be
passed to the icmake dependent programs. As described above, the
delimiting two hyphens are not necessary when the
<span   class="bold"><b>-i</b></span> flag is used.</p><p>The icmake specification file is written as a C program, and
contains a <span   class="emphasis"><em>main()</em></span> function which receives some
of the arguments specified on the command line. The first argument
is always the name of the binairy make file (normally having the
.bim extension). Remaining arguments are the arguments that follow
the two hyphens. The hyphens themselves are not included in the
series of arguments which are passed to <span   class="emphasis"><em>main()</em></span>
(The user-defined function <span   class="emphasis"><em>main()</em></span> is described
below).</p><p>Icmun</p><p>Icmun is mainly used in developing icmake. The icmun program
is an unassembler for the compiled icmake file created by icmake.
Icmun produces an assembly-like listing of the instructions
contained in the compiled makefile. Normally it is hardly ever
used. More information about icmun is beyond the scope of this
article, but can be found in the icmake documentation, which may be
obtained from, e.g., beatrix.icce.rug.nl.</p><p>The nested-level programs.</p><p>The following programs are icmake's `nested-level' programs.
Normally these programs are not started at the command-line, but
are started as child- or overlay-processes of icmake itself.</p><p>The preprocessor icm-pp.</p><p>Icm-pp is the preprocessor of the icmake compiler (described
in the next section). This program scans the icmake source file for
preprocessor directives (e.g., <b  >#include</b>, see the
section on the preprocessor directives below). and takes
appropriate actions when they are encountered. Icm-pp writes an
output file in which the preprocessor directives have been
`expanded'. This (temporary) file is used thereupon by the icmake
compiler.</p><p>The compiler icm-comp.</p><p>The stage following the preprocessing is the compilation. The
icmake compiler is called icm-comp, and this program translates an
icmake source file, generated by icm-pp, into a binary format and
performs error checking. The resulting binary file contains
opcodes, much like the output file of a compiler of a programming
language. When a binary makefile is generated, the intermediate
output file of the preprocessor is no longer needed and is
removed.</p><p>The executor icm-exec.</p><p>Icm-exec is the executor of the binary makefile generated by
icm-comp. In this phase the compiled icmake file is read. It
contains opcodes which are interpreted, thus executing the commands
defined in the icmake source file: lists of files are built, files
are compared by dates, and other actions may be taken.</p><p>Executable makefiles under Linux (Unix)</p><p>Under the Linux (UNIX) operating system it is possible to
create makefiles for icmake which are themselves executable. As an
example, this could result in a setup in which an icmakefile
&ldquo;backup&rdquo; exists, which can simply be started as:</p><p>backup</p><p>In such a setup the same effect may be achieved by creating
an icmakefile backup.im, which is then started with the
command:</p><p>icmake backup</p><p>The former form is certainly simpler to use, and requires an
executable icmake script called `backup'. To create an executable
makefile, the following steps should be taken:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The makefile can be given a suitable name. This
name is later used to invoke the process which executes the
makefile. For this reason, the name backup may be preferred to
backup.im.</p></li><li><p>The makefile is made executable using the UNIX
chmod program: <span   class="bold"><b>chmod +x backup</b></span>
</p><p>This labels the file backup as an executable program.
Furthermore, the makefile may be placed in a directory pointed to
by the PATH environment. E.g., the makefile may be placed in a
user's private bin directory.</p></li><li><p>The following line is added as the first line in
the icmake source file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/local/bin/icmake -qi
</pre></li></ol></div><p>This line informs the operating system that, when executing
this file, the program <b  >/usr/local/bin/icmake</b>
should be started, using the flags
<span   class="bold"><b>-qi</b></span> and then appending the name of
the icmake file. As discussed before, the flag
<span   class="bold"><b>-q</b></span> suppresses icmake's copyright
banner, while the flag <span   class="bold"><b>-i</b></span> causes
icmake to take the following file argument as the literal input
file instead of supplying the default extension
<span   class="bold"><b>.im</b></span>.</p><p>Note that this line must contain a full reference, including
the path, to the program icmake. In this example this path is taken
to be <b  >/usr/local/bin</b>.</p><p>The compiled icmake file
(<span   class="bold"><b>.bim</b></span> file) is placed by icmake in
the same directory as the icmake source This directory must
therefore be accessible to the user invoking the makefile. If the
icmake script and the associated .bim file is to be accessible
system-wide, the icmake script could be installed by root. Using
the example of the backup script again, root could install the
&ldquo;backup&rdquo; script using the following command in the directory where
the &ldquo;backup&rdquo; script is stored:</p><p>icmake -c backup</p><p>This will merely result in a compilation of &ldquo;backup&rdquo;, thus
generating <b  >backup.bim</b>.</p></div></div>
