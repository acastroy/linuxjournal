    Leviathan: A Linux-Based Internet Information Server
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11af580.0x12a7450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Texas Agricultural Extension Service
(TAEX) &ldquo;helps people improve their lives through an educational
process which uses scientific knowledge focused on issues and
needs&rdquo;. Much of TAEX's mission involves information transfer to the
people of the State of Texas. Like many government agencies tasked
with providing better service with a shrinking resource base, TAEX
has long been interested in innovative approaches to better serving
the public without the barriers of time and distance.
</p><p>TAEX began experimenting with electronic information
distribution in 1984 with dial-in bulletin boards. In 1992, we
rescued an aging Compaq DeskPro 286 from the auction block. We
transformed it into an experimental Gopher/PopMail/FTP (File
Transfer Protocol) server. The surprising response to this soon
filled the 40MB drive. We began an exhaustive search for a better
platform.</p><p>The best server software ran on Unix platforms, but they were
prohibitively expensive. We were already using some Unix platforms
for mail and networking applications. We tried to use one as a
gopher server, but the response time was inadequate. We realized
that additional duty as an information server would require
significant system upgrades. We would need to increase main memory,
add more mass storage, upgrade the operating system, and obtain the
separately marketed &ldquo;software development system&rdquo; (basically a C
compiler, awk, and yacc). Unfortunately, any one of these items
cost more than an entire high-end Intel-based PC! When we tried to
get price quotes, we discovered that the TCP/IP networking package
for the upgraded SVR4 operating system was &ldquo;not yet available&rdquo;.
Coincidentally, our agency also received another decrease in
funding levels.</p><p>About that same time, a Finnish college student added
networking to his free &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; operating system. This free Unix
clone ran on readily available Intel 80386/486 processors with
inexpensive drives. Initial experimentation on an 80386-based box
showed that it actually worked quite well! TCP/IP networking was
thoughtfully included, as was a superb C compiler system. Linux was
like no other Unix system we had ever used, as it combined some BSD
features with some SVR4 features, while maintaining some POSIX
compliance. Our initial confusion changed to the delightful
perception that Linux provided a most sensible mix of desirable
features.</p><p>We obtained a low-end 80486 machine, fitted with a network
card, and installed Linux. Both UMNs gopherd server and NWU's GN
combination Gopher/WWW server compiled easily, and &ldquo;Leviathan&rdquo; was
born. From a user's viewpoint, Leviathan seemed to operate faster,
and we hoped that it would be able to handle a bigger user load
than the Compaq. We transplanted the information tree from the
Compaq to Leviathan, and both machines ran side by side, tangible
proof that simple (and obsolete) computers could still be
useful.</p><p>The initial information served via gopher included the
&ldquo;Master Gardener&rdquo; files, the TAEX personnel directory, and
abstracts of all Extension bulletins and leaflets. Wherever
possible, we also provided the full text of these publications. We
put the TAEX Agricultural Software Catalog on line. The 200MB drive
soon filled, and a 300MB drive was added. Leviathan began
performing as a bootp and PopMail server as &ldquo;extra duty&rdquo;. We
scanned several clip-art collections and made them accessible.
Usage grew steadily. Soon, users from all over the world were
logging in round the clock. The March 1994 access logs showed that
2,245 sites obtained almost 100MB of mostly clip-art at a rate of
more than 500 accesses daily. Then, Mosaic happened.</p><p>We had been experimenting with the Mosaic WWW browser since
December 1993, but it was under Linux and X-Windows that I first
experienced an implementation of Mosaic that really impressed me.
Mosaic under Linux was stable, flashy, and very useful. This caused
me to review Mosaic for DOS/Windows platforms. While not as stable
and full-featured as the Unix versions, we evaluated it as
tolerable. The World Wide Web concept seemed tremendously
important, so we began demonstrating Mosaic throughout the Agency
in February 1994. Newer versions of GN had added the ability to
serve a new protocol, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (http), which
was used to tie together a &ldquo;World Wide Web&rdquo; (WWW) of networked
information servers. In May 1994, text pages were marked up for
Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), and GN began responding to http
requests as well as gopher users. Leviathan broke the 1,000
accesses/10MB per day mark that month with 31,427 requests, 3,406
of which were from http (Mosaic) clients.</p><p>We added anonymous FTP access in August 1994 at the request
of many users. Leviathan began distributing the National 4-H
Enrollment Management software via gopher, http, and ftp access. In
September, Leviathan also became TAEX's departmental CCSO qi/ph
maintenance client. The 2,000 accesses per day watermark occurred
in October 1994, when GN served 28,345 files (510MB) in 63,000
accesses, of which 60% (36,000) went to gopher clients. Access
rates increased by approximately 10,000 per month in both November
(72,300) and December (83,801). December 15th's 4,570 accesses
broke the previous record of 4,370 accesses established the day
before. December's average access rates were about 2,700 per day,
with 20.6MB of files retrieved daily. Gopher type accesses still
accounted for 51% of the accesses (42,371), but http accesses
increased more than gopher accesses from the previous month.</p><p>Cumulatively, between February and the end of December,
Leviathan served 188,672 files (3.71 gigabytes) to 33,542 unique
machines in 434,025 separate transactions, of which 295,330 went to
gopher users. During the same time, another 4,844 files (151MB)
were retrieved via anonymous ftp. Leviathan was still serving as a
bootp and PopMail server in its spare time, while accepting logins
for maintenance of our part of the University-wide CCSO &ldquo;ph&rdquo;
directory services database system. All this activity took place on
an inexpensive 80486/33 computer sitting under a table, with
neither monitor nor keyboard attached.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11af580.0x12a7818"></a>Information Server Content</h2></div></div><p>Leviathan is a niche server, publishing information of
interest mostly to adult distance learners and educators. We have
the obligatory information describing the organization, and
searchable abstracts and texts of selected agency publications. The
clip-art collection has grown to over 1,600 individual images, from
three states, available in multiple formats, with another 999
nearly ready. We added a small experimental slide image collection
that may be accessed through a &ldquo;Contact Sheet Image Selection&rdquo;
imagemap using a pointing device. The TAEX Computer Technology
Group &ldquo;OnLine&rdquo; computer user newsletter is available online, and
the &ldquo;Master Gardener Problem Solver&rdquo; has been extremely popular.
The TAEX Software Catalog is available interactively and may be
downloaded in PostScript, text, HTML, and WordPerfect formats.
</p><p>Leviathan also serves documents from sources external to
Extension. The Texas Telecommunications Strategic Plan and its
Executive Summary are accessible. The National Performance Review
documents are available. A large collection of Internet
information, including all RFCs (Requests For Comment), FYIs (For
Your Information), and STDs (STandards Documents) to date may be
browsed. Leviathan includes convenient links to all WWW and gopher
servers and enables easy access to other Cooperative Extension
information servers. To aid others who wish to establish WWW sites,
Leviathan provides a collection of icons (some developed locally)
and links to pertinent tutorial and technical documents.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11af580.0x12a7978"></a>Future Directions</h2></div></div><p>TAEX is preparing a newer, faster server with more storage
capacity to better serve Leviathan's users. The immense popularity
of the clip art collections has stimulated us to prepare even more.
We are preparing an extensive collection of slide images that may
be distributed freely for use in demonstrations and publications.
We are updating our online personnel directory with plans to
provide color photos and sound clips of everyone in the agency for
easy access by the traditional media. The online personnel
directory may someday be linked to a &ldquo;home page&rdquo; for every person
that includes a description of individual expertise and experience.
We are considering making several large topical databases
accessible online. The popular Master Gardener series begs to be
updated with color images, sound clips and animation sequences. We
plan to add more on-line newsletters replete with color graphics.
We are considering distributing some free software packages by
gopher and http access.
</p><p><a href="1048s1.html" target="_self">Reaching Leviathan
sidebar</a></p><p>TAEX is working with several other departments and agencies
to stimulate the proliferation of more information servers. The
South West Agricultural Meteorological Information Service (SWAMI)
has been supplying pertinent weather information from a Sun
workstation for several months. More recently, &ldquo;Monarch&rdquo;, the TAEX
Planning, Performance, and Accountability Server, came on-line on a
DOS/Windows platform to keep the public and state legislators
appraised of agency activities. Three of the Texas Research and
Extension Centers plan to establish information servers. Two more
experimental servers using alternative free software are currently
&ldquo;under construction&rdquo; as TAEX explores this evolving
technology.</p><p>The combination of telecommunications and computer
innovations will together produce a technological imperative for
change. This may require a major paradigm shift from information
distribution toward providing information access. TAEX is preparing
for the day when all of the information produced and distributed by
the agency may also be made available digitally and online. With
luck, it may actually be ready when the public is.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11af580.0x12a7be0"></a>Impact of The TAEX Information Server</h2></div></div><p>Leviathan has achieved some degree of national and
international recognition. The NCSU list of &ldquo;Top Ten Home Pages by
Cooperative Extension Workers&rdquo; points to us, as does their list of
&ldquo;Top Ten Extension-Related WWW Pages&rdquo;. Other Cooperative Extension
services across the US and in Australia, Mexico, India, Israel, and
Czechoslovakia have downloaded clipart. A cookbook, published in
the UK by an author from Bangladesh, incorporated some of the clip
art as illustrations. An Australian server began mirroring
Leviathan down under. Leviathan has been mentioned in several
Canadian Agricultural publications. Leviathan was designated as a
&ldquo;Gopher Jewel&rdquo; by several sites, and America OnLine lists it as
their first agricultural information site.
</p><p>The on-line software and image distribution has cut
distribution costs considerably and made TAEX products more easily
accessible. For example, Leviathan distributed 2.6GB of clip art
on-line, saving taxpayers almost $17,000, compared to traditional
floppy-based distribution methods. Each download of the Software
catalog saves $5.00 in direct printing and mailing costs and has
increased software distribution activity substantially. The
National 4-H Enrollment Management software, distributed across the
Internet has saved taxpayers more than $1,200 so far and provides
more timely dissemination of updated versions. The 500MB of &ldquo;Master
Gardener&rdquo; files would have filled 100,000 pages if printed, but
being available electronically has saved $4,000 to date in printing
costs alone. Most importantly, Leviathan has created an awareness
of information server technology as a viable adjunct to traditional
information distribution techniques.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11af580.0x12a7d40"></a>Usage Analysis</h2></div></div><p>While TAEX has received many favorable comments via e-mail, a
more accurate progress assessment can be made by analyzing user
access patterns.
</p><p>Between February 13 and December 31, 1994, certain trends
emerged. Daily usage patterns were high between 9:00 AM and 5:00
PM, but there were no &ldquo;dead&rdquo; hours. Weekend usage was about half
that of weekday usage. Mosaic (http) access grew rapidly, but
represented only 49% of Leviathan's total accesses. Gopher access
was still important in 1994. The majority (62%) of the users were
in the United States. Of these, most (67%) were from educational
institutions, 16% were from the commercial (.com) domain, and 6%
were from the government (.gov) domain. Leviathan's users were
mostly (80%) from outside the TAMU system. Some 69,476 accesses
(16%) were from Texas, which means that 84% of the requests were
from out of state. Texas County Extension Agents visited 1062
times, while 215 Texas Extension Specialists connected 38,561
times.</p><p>Leviathan has been visited by people in 62 identifiable
countries outside the United States on six continents. There have
been contacts from 793 different educational domains in all 50
states. Delphi users accessed Leviathan 3,365 times, and America
OnLine subscribers called 2,172 times. Compuserve users finally
connected 48 times in December. The server has been contacted by
1,270 individual host machines more than 50 times; 561 of these
visited more than 100 times; and 22 dropped in more than 1000 times
in that period.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11af580.0x12a7ef8"></a>Lessons Learned from the Leviathan

combining to produce a technological imperative for change,
requiring information access as well as traditional information
distribution techniques. Government agencies will continue to be
asked to provide more and better services with a shrinking resource
base. Demand for information access will likely continue to
increase for the foreseeable future, causing a corresponding demand
for more network bandwidth. The TAEX combination FTP/Gopher/WWW
server demonstrates that a low cost (&gt; $1,500 US) computer
running only free software can supply a moderate-to-large amount of
information. Usage is growing at a rate of 10,000 accesses monthly.
Demand for gopher http access. FTP is still a viable and desired
method of file transfer. Information servers provide information to
inhabitants of the global village without barriers of time and
distance. TAEX's Gopher/WWW/FTP information server is a promising
alternative medium for outreach and distance learning for our
changing clientele. It is a digital extension of the agency's
motto: People Helping People.</p></div></div>
