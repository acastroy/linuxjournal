    Building shared libraries for Linux is often considered a
    black art. In this article, Eric explains five simple steps
    to producting a standard Linux shared library and tells the
    cuious where to find more information
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2306580.0x23fe3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Shared libraries are probably most often
used because they allow for the creation of shared executables,
which take less disk space. They also allow the compression of
multiply defined global variables into a single instance of the
variable that all program modules share. Also possible is the
creation of a compatible, drop-in replacement for an existing
shared library. Improvements or fixes in the replacement library
are then immediately available to executables the library is linked
with. This last possibility is beyond the scope of this article.
</p><p>Dynamically linked libraries (DLLs) have become an important
part of the Linux system. Even though ELF (the executable and
linking format designed for Unix SVR4), which makes creating shared
libraries trivial, is just over the horizon, the current
<b  >a.out</b> DLL shared libraries will probably need to
be supported for some time. In many cases, older versions of Linux
will still need support, and commercial <b  >a.out</b>
libraries may require that an executable be built using
<b  >a.out</b> DLLs, because <b  >a.out</b>
libraries and ELF libraries cannot be mixed in one executable.
Until ELF makes its way from the alpha releases of Linux into the
more stable releases required for a production environment-and
probably even after that-<b  >a.out</b> shared libraries
will continue to be built and used.</p><p>Provided with the source code for a static library, a shared
version of the library can be created by completing five well
defined steps. This article will explain how to apply these steps
to create a simple shared library. Its aim is to help you
understand shared libraries and how they are built, so you can
successfully create more complicated shared libraries in the
future.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2306580.0x23fe710"></a>Background</h2></div></div><p>This article assumes the use of <b  >gcc</b> 2.6.2
and DLL <b  >tools</b> 2.16 with libc 4.6.27. Other
versions may have slightly different syntax or may operate
differently. All these items may be obtained by anonymous
<b  >ftp</b> from <b  >tsx-11.mit.edu</b> in
<b  >/pub/linux/packages/GCC/</b>
(<b  >tools-2.16.tar.gz</b> is in the
<b  >src</b> directory). Follow closely all the
installation instructions in the release notes, or unnecessary
problems may result.
</p><p>Shared libraries consist of two basic parts: the
<b  >stub</b> and the <b  >image</b>. The stub
library has an extension of <b  >.sa</b>. The stub is the
library an executable will be linked to. It provides redirection of
shared functions and variables to the location where the real
shared functions and variables reside in memory. The library image
has an extension of <b  >.so</b>, followed by a version
number.</p><p>The library image contains the actual executable functions
used by binary programs. The image also contains two tables of
particular note: the jump table and the global offset table (GOT).
The jump table contains eight-byte entries which redirect a call to
a shared function from the jump table to the real function. The
jump table exists to provide a method for creating compatible
replacement libraries. Since each function has an entry of fixed
size in the jump table, the jump table can provide an entry point
for these functions at a location that remains constant between
revisions of a library. This allows previously linked executables
to continue to function without recompilation. The global offset
table functions for global variables as the jump table does for
library functions.</p><p>Each shared library is loaded at a fixed address between
<b  >0x60000000</b> and <b  >0xc0000000</b>. If
an executable is linked to two or more shared libraries, the
libraries must not occupy the same address range. If two libraries
should overlap, the location an executable is redirected to may not
contain the expected function or variable. A list of registered
shared libraries can be found in the <b  >tools</b> 2.16
distribution in the directory
<b  >doc/table_description</b>. Examine this file when
defining the load address for a new shared library to ensure that
it doesn't conflict with the address for an existing library. In
addition, you should probably register the address space used by a
new shared library so that future libraries will not conflict with
it. Registration is particularly important if the library is to be
distributed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2306580.0x23fee48"></a>Before Beginning</h2></div></div><p>As mentioned earlier, this procedure is directed at the
creation of a <span   class="emphasis"><em>simple</em></span> shared library. Although
the steps for building a more complex library are the same, the
process of modifying multiple or complex makefiles can become
somewhat confusing. For your first attempt it is a good idea to
select a library which has all the library source in a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>single directory</em></span>. A good choice may be the
JPEG library, which can be retrieved by anonymous FTP from
<b  >ftp.funet.fi</b> with file name
<b  >/pub/gnu/ghostscript3/jpegsrc.v5.tar.gzi</b>. Or you
could create several simple source code modules and a makefile to
compile and build a static library. This test library need not do
anything useful, since it is only for educational purposes.
However, since you will already understand the inner workings of
the build process, you can avoid the effort of attempting to
understand another program's makefile logic. Also, be sure that a
static version of the library can be successfully compiled before
approaching the construction of a shared one.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2306580.0x23ff0b0"></a>Step One: Setup</h2></div></div><p>The method presented here is not the only way to create a
shared library, but it has often proved successful. It provides, in
the form of a file to include in the makefile, a simple record of
the parameters and the method used to build a particular library.
First, create the file that will be included in the makefile; call
it <b  >Shared.inc</b>. The file should look something
like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
SL_NAME=libxyz
SL_PATH=/usr/local/lib
SL_VERSION=1.0.0
SL_LOAD_ADDRESS=0x6a380000
SL_JUMP_TABLE_SIZE=1024
SL_GOT_SIZE=1024
SL_IMPORT=/usr/lib/libc.sa
SL_EXTRA_LIBS=/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux\
        /2.6.2/libgcc.a -lc
SHPARMS=-l$(SL_PATH)/$(SL_NAME)\
        -v$(SL_VERSION) \
        -a$(SL_LOAD_ADDRESS) \
        -j$(SL_JUMP_TABLE_SIZE) \
        -g$(SL_GOT_SIZE)
VERIFYPARMS=-l$(SL_NAME).so.$(SL_VERSION) -- \
        $(SL_NAME).sa
CC=gcc -B/usr/bin/jump
pre-shlib: $(LIBOBJECTS)
shlib-import:
        buildimport $(SL_IMPORT)
shlib:  $(LIBOBJECTS)
        mkimage $(SHPARMS) -- $(LIBOBJECTS)
$(SL_EXTRA_LIBS)
        mkstubs $(SHPARMS) -- $(SL_NAME)
        verify-shlib $(VERIFYPARMS)
</pre><p>The first section consists of a series of variable definitions.
These variables have the following meanings:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><b  >SL_NAME</b></span></dt><dd><p>The name of the library which is being
built.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >SL_PATH</b></span></dt><dd><p>The location where the shared library will
live.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >SL_VERSION</b></span></dt><dd><p>The library version.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >SL_LOAD_ADDRESS</b></span></dt><dd><p>The absolute address in memory where the library
will be loaded. (Examine the <b  >table_description</b>
file provided with the DLL tools to make sure this address doesn't
overlap with another library).</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >SL_JUMP_TABLE_SIZE</b></span></dt><dd><p>The size of the jump table. (Give this any value
for the moment; an appropriate value will be determined
later).</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >SL_GOT_SIZE</b></span></dt><dd><p>The size of the global offset table. (Give this any
value for the moment; an appropriate value will be determined
later).</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >SL_EXTRA_LIBS</b></span></dt><dd><p>Other libraries which are required to build the
shared image.</p></dd></dl></div><p><b  >SL_IMPORT</b> indicates other shared libraries to
import symbols from. These imported symbols are used to help direct
global variable references to their proper locations in other
shared libraries. The libraries specified here should be any shared
libraries which are required to build the target library. The
target <b  >shlib-import</b> makes use of a
<b  >/bin/sh</b> script called
<b  >buildimport</b>, which is invoked with
<b  >SL_IMPORT</b> as a parameter. The <b  >build
   import</b> script should contain the following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
echo -n &gt; $JUMP_DIR/jump.import
for lib in $*;
  do nm --no-cplus -o $lib | \
     grep '__GOT__' | sed 's/__GOT__/_/'\
      &gt; $JUMP_DIR/jump.import
done
</pre><p>This script uses nm, grep and sed to extract the symbols from the
global offset tables of each of the stub libraries specified on the
command line to create a file called jump.import (the nm command
sequence is excerpted from &ldquo;Using DLL Tools With Linux&rdquo;). Be sure
to <b  >chmod u+x buildimport</b>.
<b  >SL_EXTRA_LIBS</b> are libraries which will be
required to successfully build the library. Usually most of these
libraries can be determined by examining a makefile which builds an
executable using this library (often there are test programs
included with the source for the library). libgcc.a is required
with gcc 2.6.2; if it is left out, there will be an unresolved
reference for <b  >_main</b>. It is usually necessary to
explicitly specify libc with <b  >-lc</b>. If there
should be unresolved references when the library image is made,
chances are that a required library was omitted.</p><p>The definition of <b  >CC</b> as <b  >gcc
-B/usr/bin/jump</b> is telling the compiler to use an
assembler called <b  >/usr/bin/jumpas</b> instead of the
default assembler. Be sure to check what other parameters are
specified in the original makefile (and whether
<b  >CC</b> was defined as the compiler variable) and
make additions and changes as necessary. <b  >CC</b> is
nearly always defined, and thus has been used in this example. If
you use a version of DLL tools earlier than version 2.16, it may be
necessary to specify <b  >CC</b> as <b  >gcc
-B/usr/dll/jump/</b>.</p><p>The targets <b  >pre-shlib</b> and
<b  >shlib</b> both have <b  >LIBOBJECTS</b> as
dependencies. You will probably find a list or a variable
containing a list of the library dependencies in the target for the
static library in the original makefile. You should define
<b  >LIBOBJECTS</b> as this list of dependencies, or you
should replace all instances in Shared.inc with the dependencies
specified for the static library. Take care when constructing a
dependency list for a shared library; it is not uncommon for source
code modules to be compiled even though they are not part of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>final library</em></span>. The only objects that should be
compiled during the building of a shared library are those that
will eventually become part of the library. If other objects are
compiled, the symbols and globals used in those modules will end up
in the jump configuration files for the library, and possibly in
the library itself. These undesirable functions and variables may
result in troublesome behavior or failure of the library build
process.</p><p>In general, make sure you understand how the library object
files are built. Also, make certain that the shared library objects
are built using the same flags and options that were present for
the original library. Now edit the library makefile (make a backup
first), and add the following statement to the end of the list of
makefile targets:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 include Shared.inc
</pre><p>Finally, from the source directory of the library, do the
   following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 mkdir jump
 JUMP_LIB=libxyz
 export JUMP_LIB
 JUMP_DIR=`pwd`/jump
 export JUMP_DIR
</pre><p>These commands create a work directory for the DLL tools and
assembler, and set the necessary environment variables which are
required to successfully build a shared library. It will be
necessary to use setenv if a csh variant is in use. Remember to
replace libxyz with the name of the target library (as specified in
<b  >SL_NAME</b>).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2306580.0x27f8d20"></a>Step Two: The First Compile</h2></div></div><p>Before each compile remove the old <b  >.o</b>
files to ensure that the object code is rebuilt. Executing a
<b  >make clean</b> may be sufficient; however, be
careful-many makefiles will remove more than the
<b  >.o</b> files and you may need to reconfigure the
source code. Often an <b  >rm *.o</b> will work more
dependably.</p><p>If everything has been set up properly, it should now be
possible to begin the first compile by entering:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 make pre-shlib
</pre><p>This step compiles the library using the assembler prefixed
by the <b  >-B</b> switch. This will extract the
necessary symbols from the library source into a file called
<b  >jump.log</b>. From <b  >jump.log</b>, the
global variables and functions will be extracted into the necessary
configuration files where the DLL tools will find them. Once all
the source has been compiled, change to the directory that was
specified in <b  >JUMP_DIR. Jump.log</b> should be in
this directory. Now execute the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 getvars
 getfuncs
 rm -f jump.log
</pre><p>These commands will create the files <b  >jump.vars</b>
and <b  >jump.funcs</b>. <b  >jump.vars</b>
contains a list of the global variables found during the compile,
while <b  >jump.funcs</b> contains a list of functions.
If, for some reason, you don't want to export a symbol found in
<b  >jump.funcs</b> or <b  >jump.vars</b>, move
the entry to a file called <b  >jump.ignore</b> in the
<b  >JUMP_DIR</b> directory. Be sure to remove any
entries added to <b  >jump.ignore</b> from the original
file. Now return to the compile directory.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2306580.0x27f95b8"></a>Step Three: Importing Symbols</h2></div></div><p>Now you should create the <b  >jump.imports</b>
file. Since a target was previously defined in
<b  >Shared.inc</b>, simply enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 make shlib-import
</pre><p>There now should be a file called <b  >jump.imports</b>
in the <b  >JUMP_DIR</b> directory. Nothing needs to be
done with this file; it will be used to determine which global
variables should be located in one of the imported libraries.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2306580.0x27f98d0"></a>Step Four: The Second Compile</h2></div></div><p>The second compile is necessary to determine the sizes of the
global variables. The sizes of the globals must be known so that
the GOT pointers can be set properly. Remove the
<b  >.o</b> files from the previous compile and then do
the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 make pre-shlib
</pre><p>Now change to the <b  >JUMP_DIR</b> directory and
execute:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 getsize &gt; jump.vars-new
 mv jump.vars jump.vars-old
 mv jump.vars-new jump.vars
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2306580.0x27f9b90"></a>Step Five: Building The Library</h2></div></div><p>Before actually building the shared image and stub libraries,
the jump table and GOT must be allocated enough storage for all the
existing functions and global variables as well as for functions or
globals that may be added in revisions to the library. To determine
the required number of bytes for the jump table and the GOT,
execute the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 wc -l $JUMP_DIR/jump.funcs
 wc -l $JUMP_DIR/jump.vars
</pre><p>Multiply the resultant line counts by 8 to calculate a lower bound
for the number of bytes required for existing functions and global
variables, respectively. These values should be padded
significantly to allow for future library expansion. Now edit
<b  >Shared.inc</b> and replace the settings of
<b  >SL_JUMP_TABLE_SIZE</b> and
<b  >SL_GOT_SIZE</b> with the values just determined. If
you receive an overflow message while building the image, increase
these values. Keep in mind that these sizes should be multiples of
8, and that the values calculated are minimums, and will probably
not be sufficient to build the library image.</p><p>Now everything should be ready to actually build the shared
image and stub. Without removing the <b  >.o</b> files,
execute:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 make shlib
</pre><p>This will first build the image, and then the stub library.
Then the stub and image will be verified to check that the
libraries were built properly. If all goes well, the last message
should be something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Used address range 0x6a37f020-0x6a395020 be aware! must be unique! The
stub library and the sharable libraries have identical symbols.
</pre><p>The address range indicated in the first line is somewhat
misleading, since a load address of <b  >0x6a380000</b>,
not <b  >0x6a37f020</b>, was specified. This is normal.
However, make note of the last address since it indicates the last
address used by the library. This address is usually padded
somewhat to make sure that room is left for expansion. The address
range might be recorded as <b  >0x6a380000-0x6a395fff</b>
or <b  >0x6a380000-0x6a39ffff</b>, depending on how much
space might be required in the future.</p><p>The second line indicates that the image and stub libraries
were built correctly. If the verification process should indicate
that the stub and image differ, an error has occurred. Possibly one
of the most common errors is when the <b  >JUMP_LIB</b>
environment variable and <b  >SL_NAME</b> don't match.
Double check that these two variables match if there should be a
problem. If everything has gone correctly there should now be a
stub and image library. The image should be copied to the directory
specified by <b  >SL_PATH</b> and the stub should be
placed where it can be found by the compiler and linker. Once these
files have been copied to their final directories, enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 ldconfig -v
</pre><p>There should be output similar to the following, indicating
that <b  >ldconfig</b> has created a symbolic link for
the new library in which the name only contains the major version
number. This is done because a look-up on the library is done using
only the major version number.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 libxyz.so.1 =&gt; libxyz.so.1.0.0 (changed)
</pre><p>If <b  >ldconfig</b> doesn't find the library, make sure
that the directory in which the library is located is included in
the list in <b  >/etc/ld.so.conf</b>. It should now be
possible to make use of the new library. <b  >Shared.inc,
jump.vars, jump.funcs, jump.import</b> and
<b  >jump.ignore</b> should be saved. These files will be
useful if you need to rebuild the library or create a compatible
replacement.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2306580.0x270d1c8"></a>Trail's End</h2></div></div><p>This article has outlined a method for creating a simple
