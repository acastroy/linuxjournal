    Need figures and charts? Robert shows us how to get here
    with a Linux system. Guess how he did the figures for this
    article?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xee0580.0xfd84a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Need a schematic diagram for a paper? How
about a floorplan of a house? A title page for a report? Or do you
need to add text to an existing PostScript figure? Xfig can do all
that. Xfig (facility for interactive generation of figures under
X11) is a drawing program that provides a powerful (forget Windows
Paintbrush!) tool to get the look you
want.</p><p><a href="1043f1.jpg" target="_self">Figure 1</a></p><p>Typing
<b  >xfig</b>
 brings up a window with a variety of panels. You make (and edit)
drawings with the tools along the left side of the window as shown
in Figure 1. The top half of the column is the drawing modes panel.
It includes tools for creating two types of circles (starting at
the center - the left choice - or starting with a point on the
circle), ellipses (same options), a variety of splines (that go
through your points or near control points), arcs, line segments,
open and closed figures and text. You can also import PostScript
figures to embed in your drawing. Any figures that you make can
then be moved, scaled, flipped, copied to other parts of the
drawing, or rotated using the editing mode panel.</p><p>To make a circle, click your cursor on the left circle tool
in the drawing mode panel. Now move to the drawing canvas and click
again. This places the center of the circle at that point. Now move
the cursor in any direction until the growing circle on the canvas
is the size you want. Click the left mouse button again to fix the
circle in place. If you don't like it, click the right mouse button
and the circle disappears, allowing you to start over. (Or you can
select the undo button on the top line of the window.) To pick a
different shape, click on another drawing mode tool. Most of the
other drawing tools work about the same way.</p><p>If you are the least bit unhappy with your figure, edit it
using the editing mode panel. Individual objects can be moved by
use move mode: click the left mouse button on the object, move the
cursor to the new location and click again. (The right mouse button
cancels the move.) Clicking on some types of objects brings up an
edit panel, which allows for micro-adjustments to the shape and
characteristics of the object. Figure 2 shows the edit panel that
corresponds to the upper blue box of Figure 1.</p><p><a href="1043f3.jpg" target="_self">Figure 2</a></p><p>The box is blue, as is the lower box, but the intensity is
60%, while the lower box is 95%. Using the edit panel, the color
could be changed to seven others (counting black and white) and the
intensities can be varied. The point box shows the x and y
coordinates. Each value may be changed by editing the boxes. For
other shapes, such as a polyline (made of a connected series of
line segments), individual points can be moved, subtracted or added
to change the shape of the line.</p><p>Text fonts, line thicknesses, and colors all can be changed
before drawing an object by using the indicator panel at the bottom
of the Xfig window. These buttons change according to the mode you
have chosen. One neat feature is the smart-links mode used when
moving objects. Lines connecting boxes in your figure expand or
shrink with the movement of a box, keeping everything connected.
This helps when you want to move things in flow and organizational
charts.</p><p>The man pages for Xfig serve as a complete user's manual,
providing much more detail than I have here. You can print them
with
<b  >man -t,xfig| lpr -Plp</b>
, with the -
<b  >t</b>
, providing a formatting appropriate for a PostScript printer named

<b  >lp</b>
. Besides describing all the features, the man page provides
details about changing the default parameters. I aliased
<b  >xfig</b>
 to
<b  >xfig -P -e ps -startf 16</b>
, so that my default export parameters are portrait rather than
landscape on the PostScript formatted page, and the font size
starts up at 16, instead of the 12 point default size.</p><p>Xfig will export your drawing in a variety of formats, such
as PostScript, Latex (and PicTex), X11 bitmap (xpm), PIC and HPGL,
for printing or including into a document - in color and with the
fonts you want. You can do the exporting from within Xfig or via
postprocessing using
<b  >fig2dev</b>
, which comes with Xfig.</p><p>
<b  >fig2dev -L ps NAME.fig
NAME.ps</b>
 converts <span   class="emphasis"><em>NAME.fig</em></span> to a PostScript file,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>NAME.ps.</em></span> The other valid graphics language
(-L) options are box, epic, eepic, eepicemu, ibmgl, latex, null,
pic, pictex, ps, pstex, pstex_t, textyl, and tpic.</p><p>To add extra flourishes to your drawing, trying using xpaint
along with xfig. Xpaint is a simple-to-use paint program, written
by David Koblas, that will import xbm (X11 bitmap) from xfig and
save the result in a variety of formats, including PostScript.
Figure 3 gives an example of effects that you can add to
Xfig-generated drawings with Xpaint.</p><p><a href="1043f4.jpg" target="_self">Figure 3</a>
</p><p>Xpaint comes up with a toolbox filled with a variety of
painting tools. The file button opens a new canvas, retrieves an
old canvas, or imports a figure. Once the canvas is open, a palette
is presented for colors and patterns at the bottom. Getting around
<b  >xpaint</b>
 is very simple and a credit to its designer.</p><p><a href="1043s1.html" target="_self">Getting Xfig sidebar</a></p></div></div>
