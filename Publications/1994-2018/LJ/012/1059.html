    The Executable and Linking Format (ELF) has been a popular
    topic lately. People wonder why the kernel configuations
    script asks whether or not to donfigure loading ELF
    executables. As ELF will eventually be the common object
    file format for Linux binaries, it is appropriate to
    document it a bit. This month, Eric introduces us to ELF,
    and next month he will give us a guided tour of real ELF
    files.

release of ELF file format compilers and utilities, it is a logical
time to explain the differences between <b  >a.out</b>
and ELF, and discuss how they will be visible to the user. As long
as I am at it, I will also guide you on a tour of the internals of
the ELF file format and show you how it works. I realize that Linux
users range from people brand new to Unix to people who have used
Unix systems for years&mdash;for this reason I will start with a fairly
basic explanation which may be of little use to the more
experienced users, because I would like this article to be useful
in some way to as many people as possible.</p><p>People often ask why we are bothering with a new file format.
A couple reasons come to mind&mdash;first, the current shared libraries
can be somewhat cumbersome to build, especially for large packages
such as the X Window System that span multiple directories. Second,
the current <b  >a.out</b> shared library scheme does not
support the <b  >dlopen()</b> function, which allows you
to tell the dynamic loader to load additional shared libraries. Why
ELF? The Unix community seems to be standardizing this file format;
various implementations of SVr4 such as MIPS, Solaris, Unixware
currently use ELF; SCO will reportedly switch to ELF in the near
future; and there are rumors of other vendors switching to ELF. One
interesting sidenote&mdash;Windows NT uses a file format based upon the
COFF file format, the SVr3 file format that the Unix community is
abandoning in favor of ELF.</p><p>Let us start at the beginning. Users will generally encounter
three types of ELF files&mdash;<b  >.o</b> files, regular
executables, and shared libraries. While all of these files serve
different purposes, their internal structure files are quite
similar. Thus we can begin with a general description, and proceed
to a discussion of the specifics of the three file types. Next
month, I will demonstrate the use of the readelf program, which can
be used to display and interpret various portions of ELF
files.</p><p>One universal concept among all different ELF file types (and
also <b  >a.out</b> and many other executable file
formats) is the notion of a section. This concept is important
enough to spend some time explaining. Simply put, a section is a
collection of information of a similar type. Each section
represents a portion of the file. For example, executable code is
always placed in a section known as <b  >.text</b>; all
data variables initialized by the user are placed in a section
known as <b  >.data</b>; and uninitialized data is placed
in a section known as <b  >.bss</b></p><p>In principle, one could devise an executable file format
where everything is jumbled together&mdash;MS-DOS binaries come to mind.
But dividing executables into sections has important advantages.
For example, once you have loaded the executable portions of an
executable into memory, these memory locations need not change. (In
principle, program executable code could modify itself, but this is
considered to be extremely poor programming practice.) On modern
machine architectures, the memory manager can mark portions of
memory read-only, such that any attempt to modify a read-only
memory location results in the program dying and dumping core.
Thus, instead of merely saying that we do not expect a particular
memory location to change, we can specify that any attempt to
modify a read-only memory location is a fatal error indicating a
bug in the application. That being said, typically you cannot
individually set the read-only status for each byte of
memory&mdash;instead you can individually set the protections of regions
of memory known as pages. On the i386 architecture the page size is
4096 bytes&mdash;thus you could indicate that addresses
<b  >0-4095</b> are read-only, and bytes
<b  >4096</b> and up are writable, for example.</p><p>Given that we want all executable portions of an executable
in read-only memory and all modifiable locations of memory (such as
variables) in writable memory, it turns out to be most efficient to
group all of the executable portions of an executable into one
section of memory (the <b  >.text</b> section), and all
modifiable data areas together into another area of memory
(henceforth known as the <b  >.data</b> section).</p><p>A further distinction is made between data variables the user
has initialized and data variables the user has not initialized. If
the user has not specified the initial value of a variable, there
is no sense wasting space in the executable file to store the
value. Thus, initialized variables are grouped into the
<b  >.data</b> section, and uninitialized variables are
grouped into the <b  >.bss</b> section, which is special
because it doesn't take up space in the file&mdash;it only tells how
much space is needed for uninitialized variables.</p><p>When you ask the kernel to load and run an executable, it
starts by looking at the image header for clues about how to load
the image. It locates the <b  >.text</b> section within
the executable, loads it into the appropriate portions of memory,
and marks these pages as read-only. It then locates the
<b  >.data</b> section in the executable and loads it
into the user's address space, this time in read-write memory.
Finally, it finds the location and size of the
<b  >.bss</b> section from the image header, and adds the
appropriate pages of memory to the user's address space. Even
though the user has not specified the initial values of variables
placed in <b  >.bss</b>, by convention the kernel will
initialize all of this memory to zero.</p><p>Typically each <b  >a.out</b> or ELF file also
includes a symbol table. This contains a list of all of the symbols
(program entry points, addresses of variables, etc.) that are
defined or referenced within the file, the address associated with
the symbol, and some kind of tag indicating the type of the symbol.
In an <b  >a.out</b> file, this is more or less the
extent of the information present; as we shall see later, ELF files
have considerably more information. In some cases, the symbol
tables can be removed with the strip utility. The advantage is that
the executable is smaller once stripped, but you lose the ability
to debug the stripped binary. With <b  >a.out</b> it is
always possible to remove the symbol table from a file, but with
ELF you typically need some symbolic information in the file for
the program to load and run. Thus, in the case of ELF, the strip
program will remove a portion of the symbol table, but it will
never remove all of the symbol table.</p><p>Finally, we need to discuss the concept of relocations. Let
us say you compile a simple &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; program:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 main( )
 {
        printf("Hello World\n");
 }
</pre><p>The compiler generates an object file which contains a
reference to the function <b  >printf</b> . Since we have
not defined this symbol, it is an external reference. The
executable code for this function will contain an instruction to
call <b  >printf</b>, but in the object code we do not
yet know the actual location to call to perform this function. The
assembler notices that the function <b  >printf</b> is
external, and it generates a relocation, which contains several
components. First, it contains an index into the symbol table&mdash;this
way, we know which symbol is being referenced. Second, it contains
an offset into the <b  >.text</b> section, which refers
to the address of the operand of the call instructions. Finally, it
contains a tag which indicates what type of relocation is actually
present. When you link this file, the linker walks through the
relocations, looks up the final address of the external function
<b  >printf</b>, then patches this address back into the
operand of the call instruction so the call instruction now points
to the actual function <b  >print</b>.</p><p><b  >a.out</b> executables have no relocations. The
kernel loader cannot resolve any symbols and will reject any
attempt to run such a binary. An <b  >a.out</b> object
file will of course have relocations, but the linker must be able
to fully resolve these to generate a usable executable.</p><p>So far everything I have described applies to both
<b  >a.out</b> and ELF. Now I will enumerate the
shortcomings of <b  >a.out</b> so that it is more clear
why we would want to switch to ELF.</p><p>First, the header of an <b  >a.out</b> file (struct
exec, defined in <b  >/usr/include/linux/a.out.h</b>)
contains limited information. It only allows the above-described
sections to exist and does not directly support any additional
sections. Second, it contains only the sizes of the various
sections, but does not directly specify the offsets within the file
where the section starts. Thus the linker and the kernel loader
have some unwritten understanding about where the various sections
start within a file. Finally, there is no built-in shared library
support&mdash;<b  >a.out</b> was developed before shared
library technology was developed, so implementations of shared
libraries based on <b  >a.out</b> must abuse and misuse
some of the existing sections in order to accomplish the tasks
required.</p><p>About 6 months ago, the default file format switched from
ZMAGIC to QMAGIC files. Both of these are <b  >a.out</b>
formats, and the only real difference is the different set of
unwritten understandings between the linker and kernel. Both
formats of executable have a 32 byte header at the start of the
file, but with ZMAGIC the <b  >.text</b> section starts
at byte offset 1024, while with QMAGIC the <b  >.text</b>
section starts at the beginning of the file and includes the
header. Thus ZMAGIC wastes disk space, but, more importantly, the
1024 byte offset used with ZMAGIC makes efficient buffer cache
management within the kernel more difficult. With a QMAGIC binary,
the mapping from the file offset to the block representing a given
page of memory is more natural, and should allow for some
performance enhancements in the kernel. ELF binaries are also
formatted in a natural way that is compatible with possible future
changes to the buffer cache.</p><p>I have said that shared library support in
<b  >a.out</b> is lacking&mdash;while this is true, it is not
impossible to design shared library implementations that work with
<b  >a.out</b>. The current Linux shared libraries are
certainly one example; another example is SunOS-style shared
libraries which are currently used by
BSD-<span   class="emphasis"><em>du-jour</em></span>. SunOS-style shared libraries
contain a lot of the same concepts as ELF shared libraries, but ELF
allows us to discard some of the really silly hacks that were
required to piggyback a shared library implementation onto
<b  >a.out</b>.</p><p>Before we go into our hands-on description of how ELF works,
it would be worthwhile to spend a little time discussing some
general concepts related to shared libraries. Then when we start to
pick apart an ELF file, it will be easier to see what is going
on.</p><p>First, I should explain a little bit about what a shared
library is; a surprising number of people look at shared libraries
as sort of black boxes without a good understanding of what goes on
inside. Most users are at least aware of the fact that if they mess
up their shared libraries, the system can become nearly unusable.
This leads most people to treat them with a certain
reverence.</p><p>If we step back a little bit, we recall that non-shared
libraries (also known as static libraries) contain useful
procedures that programs might wish to make use of. Thus the
programmer does not need to do everything from scratch, but can use
a set of standard well-defined functions. This allows the
programmer to be more productive. Unfortunately, when you link
against a static library, the linker must extract all library
functions you require and make them part of your executable, which
can make it rather large.</p><p>The idea behind a shared library is that you would somehow
take the contents of the static library (not literally the
contents, but usually something generated from the same source
tree), and pre-link it into some kind of special executable. When
you link your program against the shared library, the linker merely
makes note of the fact that you are calling a function in a shared
library, so it does not extract any executable code from the shared
library. Instead, the linker adds instructions to the executable
which tell the startup code in your executable that some shared
libraries are also required, so when you run your program, the
kernel starts by inserting the executable into your address space,
but once your program starts up, all of these shared libraries are
also added to your address space. Obviously some mechanism must be
present for making sure that when your program calls a function in
the shared library, it actually branches to the correct location
within the shared library. I will be discussing the mechanics of
this for ELF in a little bit.</p><p><a href="1059s1.html" target="_self">More info about ELF</a>
</p><p>Now that we have explained shared libraries, we can start to
discuss some of the general concepts related to how shared
libraries are implemented under ELF. To begin with, ELF shared
libraries are position independent. This means that you can load
them more or less anywhere in memory, and they will work. The
current <b  >a.out</b> shared libraries are known as
fixed address libraries: each library has one specific address
where it must be loaded to work, and it would be foolish to try to
load it anywhere else. ELF shared libraries achieve their position
independence in a couple of ways. The main difference is that you
should compile everything you want to insert into the shared
library with the compiler switch <b  >-fPIC</b>. This
tells the compiler to generate code that is designed to be position
independent, and it avoids referencing data by absolute address as
much as possible.</p><p>Position independence does not come without a cost, however.
When you compile something to be PIC, the compiler reserves one
machine register ( <b  >%ebx</b> on the i386) to point to
the start of a special table known as the global offset table (or
GOT for short). That this register is reserved means that the
compiler will have less flexibility in optimizing code, and this
means that it will take longer to do the same job. Fortunately, our
benchmark indicates that for most normal programs the drop in
performance is less than 3% for a worst case, and in many cases
much less than this.</p><p>Another ELF feature is that its shared libraries resolve
symbols and externals at run time. This is done using a symbol
table and a list of relocations which must be performed before the
image can start to execute. While this sounds like it could be
slow, a number of optimizations built into ELF make it fairly fast.
I should mention that when you compile PIC code into a shared
library, there are generally very few relocations, one more reason
why the performance impact is not of great concern. Technically, it
is possible to generate a shared library from code that was not
compiled with <b  >-fPIC</b>, but an incredible number of
relocations would need to be performed before the shared library
was usable, another reason why <b  >-fPIC</b> is
important.</p><p>When you reference global data within a shared library, the
assembly code cannot simply load the value from memory the way you
would do with non-PIC code. If you tried this, the code would not
be position independent and a relocation would be associated with
the instruction where you were attempting to load the value from
the variable. Instead, the compiler/assembler/linker create the
GOT, which is nothing more than a table of pointers, one pointer
for each global variable defined or referenced in the shared
library. Each time the library needs to reference a given variable,
it first loads the address of the variable from the GOT (remember
that the address of the GOT is always stored in
<b  >%ebx</b> so we only need an offset into the GOT).
Once we have this, we can dereference it to obtain the actual
value. The advantage of doing it this way is that to establish the
address of a global variable, we need to store the address in only
one place, and hence we need only one relocation per global
variable.</p><p>We must do something similar for functions. It is critical
that we allow the user to redefine functions which might be in the
shared library, and if the user does, we want to force the shared
library to always use the version the user defined and never use
the version of the function in the shared library. Since the
function could conceivably be used lots of times within a shared
library, we use something known as the procedure linkage table (or
PLT) to reference all functions. In a sense this is nothing more
than a fancy name for a jumptable, an array of jump instructions,
one for each function that you might need to go to. Thus if a
particular function is called from thousands of locations within
the shared library, control will always pass through one jump
instruction. This way, you need only one relocation to determine
which version of a given function is actually called, and from the
standpoint of performance this is about as good as you are going to
get.</p><p>Next month, we will use this information to dissect real ELF
files, explaining specifics about the ELF file format.</p></div></div>
