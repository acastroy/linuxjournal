    This month's column concludes the article on Plan 9 From Bell
    Labs, and those parts of it that have been re-implemented in
    freely available software.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x117d580.0x12753f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month we described the origins of
Plan 9, the <b  >sam</b> editor, and the
<b  >9term</b> terminal emulator. Well, what about the
shell to run inside the window? Here too, the Plan 9 authors took
the opportunity to rethink the issue of just how should a shell
work. The Plan 9 shell is called <b  >rc</b>, because it
&ldquo;runs commands&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x117d580.0x1275608"></a>The <b  >rc</b> Shell</h2></div></div><p>Although in many ways the Bourne shell is a simple, elegant,
high-level programming language, it has a serious flaw, in that it
was designed to be much like a macro-processing language. Input
text is scanned, rescanned, and rescanned again, as each stage of
processing is performed. (This is carried to an almost absurd
length in the Korn shell, with something like eleven different
processing stages.) This leads to rather complicated and baroque
quoting rules, with the need for nested escape sequences.
</p><p>In <b  >rc</b>, the input text is scanned and
parsed exactly once. The language has a real
<b  >yacc</b>-based grammar, making it clear what
everything means. The quoting rules are very simple. Quoted text
must be enclosed between single quotes. To get a single quote
inside a quoted string, double it (as in FORTRAN). An explicit
operator is used to provide string concatenation, and variables can
be lists of strings, not just single strings.</p><p>The syntax is closer to that of C or <b  >awk</b>,
instead of Bourne's Algol 68. This leads to less clutter, avoiding
unnecessary keywords and semi-colons. It is much more like C than
the fabled <b  >csh</b> is.</p><p><b  >rc</b> provides shell functions, and signal
handlers are written as functions with special names
(<b  >sighup</b>, <b  >sigterm</b>, etc.),
instead of using strings. I/O redirection is also more powerful,
with a notation for hooking up file descriptors besides 0 and 1 to
the input and output ends of a pipe.</p><p>A freely distributable clone of <b  >rc</b> is
available. It was written by Byron Rakitzis, and implements the
language described in the <b  >rc</b> paper, with some
extensions. The beauty of <b  >rc</b> is that it is small
and fast, and shell programs can be quite elegant. It also runs on
just about any kind of Unix system.</p><p>When using <b  >rc</b> with
<b  >9term</b>, it is conventional to set the primary
prompt to be just a single semi-colon, and the secondary prompt to
be empty. This allows you to snarf entire commands, including the
prompt, and resend them. The semi-colon is treated as a simple null
statement. The use of double-clicking to select the whole line, and
the default saved action of the menus make sending and resending
the same line over again extremely simple; most of the work can be
done with just the mouse.</p><p>The <a href="0062s1.html" target="_self">Resources sidebar</a> lists
the <b  >ftp</b> location of the <b  >rc</b>
shell. There is also a mailing list of people who use
<b  >rc</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x117d580.0x1275ef8"></a>The <b  >es</b> Shell</h2></div></div><p><b  >es</b> is the &ldquo;extensible shell&rdquo;. Paul Haahr
and Byron Rakitzis thought it would be interesting to try and
combine some of the capabilities of functional languages with those
of Unix shells. Many internal capabilities of the shell (such as
I/O redirection and setting up pipelines) are available as built-in
functions in the language, and program fragments can be passed
around as arguments to functions.</p><p><b  >es</b> provides first class functions, lexical
scope, an exception system, and rich return values (i.e. functions
can return values other than just numbers). Most of this is beyond
the scope of this article to explain. <b  >es</b> is
described in a paper in the Winter 1993 Usenix Conference
Proceedings. It helps to read this paper, and also to go through
the archives of the mailing list to see how the language evolved.
For the full details on <b  >es</b>, you'll need to read
the paper, the man page, and the file initial.es in the
<b  >es</b> distribution. It is a good idea to also look
at the sample .esrc file, too.</p><p>Basically, the idea behind <b  >es</b> is to take
the primitive operations that a shell does, such as forking
processes, creating pipes, and setting up I/O redirections, and
make them available as functions that a user program can call
directly. In turn, traditional shell syntax is built on top of
these primitive operations.</p><p>Lexical scoping allows you to save the definition of an
operation, and then replace it with your own operation on top of
the previous one. Here is an example from the paper on
<b  >es</b>. This code implements a pipeline profiler. It
saves the definition of <b  >%pipe</b>, which creates
pipes, and provides a new one that times each component of the
pipeline, using the old <b  >%pipe</b> to actually create
the pipeline. (<b  >es</b> is the prompt from
<b  >es</b> used for examples in the paper. The default
prompt is a semi-colon.)</p><pre     class="programlisting">

power available in <b  >es</b>. <b  >es</b>

Manager</h2></div></div><p>The tools we've seen so far, notably <b  >sam</b>
and <b  >9term</b>, are built on top of X Windows, and
work with any window manager. For some time, I ran them using
<b  >mwm</b>.</p><p>In the fall of 1993, I obtained a version of
<b  >gwm</b>, the Generic Window Manager, with WOOL
(Windows Object Oriented Lisp) code that implemented an interface
very similar to that of the original Bell Labs Blit terminal. This
provides a simple, clean interface, similar to that used on Plan 9
(8&frac12; can be considered a further evolutionary step from the
Blit). This code was written by John Mackin at the University of
Sydney. The resources sidebar shows where you can get this code, if
you're interested. This code works, but it is large and
slow.</p><p>However, a new window manager recently became available,
<b  >9wm</b>. <b  >9wm</b> implements the
window management policies of 8&frac12;, under X windows. Written
by David Hogan at the University of Sydney, it uses raw Xlib (not a
pretty sight), and is completely ICCCM compliant.
<b  >9wm</b> is also small, and very fast. To quote from
the README file:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><b  >9wm</b> is an X window manager
which attempts to emulate the Plan 9 window manager 8&frac12; as
far as possible within the constraints imposed by X. It provides a
simple yet comfortable user interface, without garish decorations
or title-bars. Or icons. And it's click-to-type. This will not
appeal to everybody, but if you're not put off yet then read on.
(And don't knock it until you've tried it).</p></blockquote></div><p><b  >9wm</b> is &ldquo;click to type&rdquo;. This means you
have to move the mouse into a particular window and then click
button one. That window becomes the current window, indicated by a
thick black border. Other windows have a thin black border. This
behavior is identical to <b  >sam</b>'s.</p><p>The <b  >9wm</b> menu (accessed through button 3 on
the root window) consists of five items:

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
  <b  >New</b> - open a new window (<b  >9term</b>
  or <b  >xterm</b> if no <b  >9term</b>)
</p></li><li><p>
  <b  >Reshape</b> - change the shape of a window on the screen,
</p></li><li><p>
  <b  >Move</b> - move a window,
</p></li><li><p>
  <b  >Delete</b> - blow away a window,
</p></li><li><p>
  <b  >Hide</b> - &ldquo;iconify&rdquo; a window.
</p></li></ul></div>
</p><p>What is perhaps most noticable about <b  >9wm</b>
(and 8&frac12;) is that there are no icons. Instead, to remove a
window from the screen, you select <b  >Hide</b> from the
main menu. The cursor becomes a target. You move the target to the
window to be hidden, and then click button 3. Clicking any other
button cancels the operation.
</p><p>When a window is hidden, it disappears from the screen
completely, not even leaving an icon. Instead, a new item appears
at the bottom of the button 3 <b  >9wm</b> menu, with the
name of the window. To open the window again, you simply select the
window's name from the menu.</p><p>As with the other programs, the <b  >9wm</b> menu
remembers what you did last time, so that the next time you pop up
the menu, the previous selection is already highlighted</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x117d580.0x126e048"></a>The <b  >9menu</b> Command Line Menu
Program</h2></div></div><p>And now, my own small contribution to the picture. The GWM
Blit emulation, which I used for quite awhile, understood that it
was built on top of X, and when you selected
<b  >New</b>, it gave you a menu of hosts (that you
defined in a configuration file) on which to start remote
<b  >xterm</b>s. This was nice, and I found it missing
under <b  >9wm</b>.</p><p>(In Plan 9, this is not an issue; the multiple hosts in the
network are very tightly integrated, but in X with Unix, it is a
problem.)</p><p>What I wanted was a simple program to which you could give
menu items and associated commands, and this program would pop up a
window that was nothing but a menu. Selecting an item would run a
command. The program would be long lived, leaving the menu up
permanently. A program close to this exists,
<b  >xmenu</b>. Unfortunately, <b  >xmenu</b>
goes away after executing the command, and is not well behaved when
interacting with <b  >9wm</b>.</p><p>Inspired by <b  >9wm</b>, starting with its menu
code, and with help from David Hogan, I wrote
<b  >9menu</b>. <b  >9menu</b> pops up a window
containing the list of items, and executes the corresponding
command when a button is pressed.</p><p><b  >9menu</b> allows you to write your own menus
and customize the behavior to suit you, without the headaches of a
<b  >.twmrc</b> or <b  >.mwmrc</b> file. It is
real easy to have one item spawn another <b  >9menu</b>,
giving a similar effect to pull-right menus.</p><p>Here are two I use it: one for remote systems, the other for
programs I may want to run. Being lazy, I have
<b  >xterm</b> in both. I use a shell script named
<b  >rxterm</b> that knows about the remote hosts I will
want to open windows on, and whether they can start a
<b  >9term</b> or an <b  >xterm</b>. (This is
left over from the GWM Blit code, and is mostly for convenience.)
These examples are from my <b  >.xinitrc</b>. The
<b  >-geometry</b> strings are to get
<b  >9wm</b> to place the windows even though they start
out iconified.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
9menu -geometry 67x136-4+477 -iconic -popdown -label Remotes \
        'solaria:rxterm solaria.cc.gatech.edu' \
        'burdell:rxterm burdell.cc.gatech.edu' \
        'chrome:rxterm chrome.cc.gatech.edu' \
        'xterm:rxterm xterm' \
        exit &amp;
9menu -geometry 103x102-3+624 -iconic -popdown -label 'X programs' \
        'xterm:rxterm xterm' \
        xtetris xlock '9wm restart' '9wm exit' exit &amp;
</pre><p>I start the programs using <b  >-iconic</b> so that
they'll be automatically hidden and part of the
<b  >9wm</b> menu. The <b  >-popdown</b> option
causes the menu to automatically iconify itself after an item is
selected, since I find this to be the most convenient way for me to
work: pop up the menu, select an item, and then go on with what I
want to do without the menu hanging around. Although not nearly as
large scale a program as <b  >sam</b>,
<b  >9term</b>, or <b  >9wm</b>, I find that
<b  >9menu</b> completes the package for me.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x117d580.0x126ed58"></a>Experiences</h2></div></div><p>I have been using this environment for almost two years, and
find it to be clean, elegant, and easy to use. Initially, I started
by using <b  >rc</b>, and then <b  >sam</b>
when it became available in early 1993. Shortly after that, I
started beta-testing <b  >9term</b>, in particular
getting it to work correctly under SunOS. In the fall of 1993, the
GWM Blit code became available, and I switched to that, using it
for almost a year. In the spring of 1994, I started beta-testing
<b  >9wm</b>, which was finally released at the end of
1994. I switched to <b  >es</b> in January of 1993 after
reading about it and hearing the presentation at the winter
Usenix.</p><p>The research group at Bell Labs is well known for applying
the &ldquo;small is beautiful&rdquo; principle to software design. This was
initially true of Unix, and has been re-applied to distributed
systems, shells, and user interfaces with Plan 9.</p><p>The interface is simple, consistent, easy to use, and very
clean. All the programs described in this column behave the same
way, in terms of what the buttons do, which window is current, and
how the menus remember the previous operation.</p><p>An important point that I have not emphasized so far, is that
all the programs use pop-up menus. I find this to be an enormous
convenience, particularly compared to systems like Windows or the
Macintosh, where you must move the mouse to the menu bar to pull
down a particular menu. Pop-up menus save an incredible amount of
otherwise useless mouse motion, leading to a system that is much
easier to use.</p><p>My first exposure to window systems was long ago, on a Blit
terminal. The interface was simple, clean and elegant. Ever since
then, I had been searching for an X windows environment that
matched the Blit's elegance. Now, with the combination of
<b  >sam</b>, <b  >9term</b>,
<b  >9wm</b> and <b  >rc</b> or
<b  >es</b>, I feel that I have finally found that
environment, and I'm very happy. What's even nicer is that all of
these programs are fast, and I have the broad range of X
applications available to me also (<b  >xoj</b>,
anyone?). This latter point is unfortunately not true of the only
other alternative, <b  >mgr</b> (which I used until
<b  >9term</b> became available.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x117d580.0x126f438"></a>Using These Programs Under Linux</h2></div></div><p>All the programs described here can be made to compile under
Linux. I don't have a Linux system of my own (believe or not!), but
for a while I borrowed one, and was able to bring up all of these
programs. Unfortunately, the system was a laptop, with too small a
screen to make using X worthwhile. <b  >sam</b> comes up
fine, using the <b  >Make.solaris</b> makefile as a
starting point. <b  >9wm</b> also compiled just fine.
<b  >9term</b> took a little bit of work, but it did
compile and run. After asking on the mailing lists, I learned that
<b  >9term</b> does not (yet) work quite correctly under
Linux. This may be fixed by the time you read this column, though.
Two people to contact for information about porting
<b  >9term</b> to Linux are Pete Fenelon
(<a href="mailto:pete@minster.york.ac.uk">pete@minster.york.ac.uk</a>),
and Markus Friedl
(<a href="mailto:msfriedl@faui01.informatik.uni-erlangen.de">msfriedl@faui01.informatik.uni-erlangen.de</a>).
<b  >rc</b> and <b  >es</b>, both compile and
run under Linux, but with some work. For <b  >rc</b>, you
have to generate the <b  >sigmsgs.c</b> file by hand,
based on <b  >/usr/src/linux/include/sys/signal.h</b>.
There is one other bug, reported by Jeremy Fitzhardinge, which is
that <b  >rc</b> uses <b  >int</b>s for the
array of additional groups, while Linux uses
<b  >gid_t</b>s, which are <b  >short</b>s.
<b  >es</b> requires similar changes for the signal
handling, but these are actually documented in the Makefile.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x117d580.0x1582df0"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>The combination of <b  >9term</b> and

powerful, easy to use editor. <b  >rc</b> is a simple,
clean shell, and <b  >es</b> is a nifty shell with lots
of promise. It is worth reading the papers describing each of these
