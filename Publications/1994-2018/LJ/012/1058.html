    Over the past year, this column has focused on configuring
    and administering several standard Unix tools. This month,
    I'd like to switch to a bit of networking. Specifically, I
    introduce how to configure TCP/IP network services for
    Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13d1580.0x14c93a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>To start, imagine the TCP/IP connection
you have (anything from an Ethernet connection to a SLIP/PPP
connection from your friendly neighborhood network provider) as
really 65,536 lines (each of which can handle many different
<span   class="emphasis"><em>conversations</em></span> at once) coming into your
machine. Some of these lines are dedicated to serving a single
purpose, but a majority of them are open for use.
</p><p>Each of these separate lines coming into your machine is
known as a port, and each Linux machine, connected to another via
TCP/IP, has 65,536 ports available on it. Each of these ports
allows a connection between the two machines, assuming there is a
program on one end that is listening to that port in question and a
program on the other end attempting to connect to it. If a
connection with the remote side is requested and a program on the
remote side is <span   class="emphasis"><em>listening</em></span> to that port, a
connection is established. This can be just about any kind of
connection, as telnet, FTP, HTTP (World Wide Web), and SMTP (mail)
all use sockets to get and receive data. Sockets are the entire
combination of local-machine, local port, remote machine, and
remote port that defines one of the communications channels
available. The number of these channels is really only limited by
available memory.</p><p>Now, there are two ways to make sure the remote side will be
able to pick up on the connection. The first is to start a program
running in the background all the time, waiting for a connection.
This can be the easiest way to do it, but requires some programming
skills and requires the program to be in memory all the time. If
you choose to run a program as a daemon, and it is not used often,
it will wind up being just wasted memory and get swapped to
disk.</p><p>The second option is to have one program listen to ALL the
ports and then, if a connection is requested, start the associated
program. This is good because programs are only run when they are
needed, but for programs that require loading a lot of files on
startup or may be called very often, it might be too slow and waste
CPU power as well.</p><p>In Linux, as in most versions of Unix, both of these options
exist. Some programs (like the http daemon or sendmail/smail or the
NFS daemon) run in the background and make and remove copies of
themselves in memory as necessary. These programs usually can have
large data files that require up to 30 seconds to load. By loading
the programs once, then spawning themselves as needed, these
programs can cut their startup time to only a few seconds. Other
programs, such as <b  >in.telnetd</b>, which handles
incoming login connections, do not need as much time to load into
memory and can be left out of memory until needed.</p><p>In the case of <b  >in.telnetd</b> and other small
programs, <b  >inetd</b> (for Internet Daemon; also
called the &ldquo;superserver&rdquo;) service comes in.
<b  >inetd</b> watches all the ports it can, and if it
sees a connection request, it checks its list to see if there is
something that wants to watch that port. If there is an entry in
its list, it starts the program up with input and output, both
directed through the socket. Otherwise, it refuses a connection,
and you see the familiar &ldquo;Connection refused&rdquo; on your
terminal.</p><p>The way to set up the inetd program is to edit a file called
/etc/inetd.conf. In this file, you may find some lines that look
like <a href="1058l1.html" target="_self">figure 1.</a></p><p>Now let's decrypt some of this. Any line starting with a # is
treated as a comment by inetd. Any other line is broken up into 6
pieces:</p><p>1) Service-This defines the port that is being watched by
inetd. The name for this is in the <b  >/etc/services</b>
file. If you look there, you'll see lines like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        ftp             21/tcp
        telnet          23/tcp
        smtp            25/tcp          mail
</pre><p>Here are three of our favorite services defined.
<b  >ftp</b>, <b  >telnet</b> and
<b  >smtp</b>. ftp uses port 21, telnet uses port 23, and
smtp uses port 25. These connections are in
<b  >/etc/services</b> so that you don't have to remember
that ftp is port 21. You just tell inetd <b  >ftp</b> and
it figures out the rest.
</p><p>2) Socket type-This can be <b  >stream</b> or
<b  >dgram</b> (for datagram). A stream is usually for a
connection that opens for a long time, and (for every case you are
likely to see) uses the tcp protocol. Telnet or FTP are great
examples of this. A datagram is a small packet of data where there
is no real connection and (again, for every case you are likely to
see) will use the udp protocol. Also available are raw, rdm, and
seqpacket.</p><p>3) Protocol-<b  >tcp</b> for streams,
<b  >udp</b> for dgram socket types. These types are
defined in <b  >/etc/protocols</b>.</p><p>4) Flags-Wait and Nowait. This is applicable only to dgram
socket types. Anything else should be defined
<b  >nowait</b>. If a datagram socket connects to another
socket and frees the socket for inetd to open another port, it is
defined <b  >nowait</b>. Otherwise, inetd should wait for
the connection to close.</p><p>5) User[.group]-This defines which user (and group
optionally) to run the following program under. It's usually root,
but some programs you may want security on and run as a lower
user.</p><p>6) Command line-Command (including any command line
parameters) to run when inetd finds activity on that port. Almost
all programs that are intended to be run from
<b  >inetd</b> have names starting with
&ldquo;<b  >in</b>&rdquo; to make this obvious.</p><p>You may note that you see a <b  >/usr/bin/tcpd</b>
in front of the programs. The <b  >tcpd</b> program
performs a few functions that <b  >inetd</b> doesn't. For
example, <b  >tcpd</b> can log the connection through the
syslog(3) facility (see <i  >Linux Journal</i> issue
11, for a discussion of syslog), verify a hostname, find the name
of the remote user that is connecting, and deny or allow services
to hosts that you can specify Some of these options require
re-compiling the tcpd program, but can greatly increase the
security of your system. One thing you can do, without
re-compiling, is limit the services available to sites known for
causing you trouble. To deny telnet (and other) access to a site,
create a file called <b  >/etc/hosts.deny</b>. In it, you
can list first the access you want to deny, a colon, then the hosts
to deny that access to.</p><p>First, list the name of the program that you want to deny.
This can be <b  >in.fingerd</b>,
<b  >in.telnetd</b>, <b  >in.ftpd</b>, etc. You
can also use the keyword ALL to signify all services.</p><p>Next, list the hosts you want to deny access to by the
following methods:</p><p>1) Network names starting with a &ldquo;.&rdquo; will deny access to all
hosts that have it as its last network name.
<b  >.clarkson.edu</b> will deny access from any host
from Clarkson, such as <b  >craft.camp.clarkson.edu</b>.
A <b  >.edu</b> will deny anyone in the
<b  >.edu</b> domain.</p><p>2) Network names that end in a &ldquo;.&rdquo; will deny access to all
hosts that have the matching string as the front portion of the
network name. For example, <b  >128.153</b>. will deny
all of the Clarkson domain, while <b  >128.153.16</b>.
will deny a portion of the Clarkson domain.</p><p>3) ALL which denies access to everyone, and LOCAL which
matches hosts whose resolved name does not contain a period (.).
Many domain name servers will resolve a name on the local subnet to
just the hostname instead of host.subnet.net. For example,
craft.capm.clarkson.edu could appear to another host on the same
subnet as just craft. The man pages for host_access (5) will
explain more wildcards.</p><p>4) The keyword EXCEPT will exempt specific hosts who would be
denied under other rules from being denied.</p><p>So a sample <b  >/etc/hosts.deny</b> could look
like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 ALL: .clarkson.edu
 EXCEPT: craft.camp.clarkson.edu
</pre><p>Which would deny all access to anyone in the Clarkson domain
except for users on the machine craft.camp.clarkson.edu.
</p><p>You can also set up an <b  >/etc/hosts.allow</b>,
following the same methods as the
<b  >/etc/hosts.deny</b>, except that the
<b  >hosts.allow</b> specifies who to specifically allow
access to. In the case of a conflict between a host being denied
and allowed, the entry in <b  >/etc/hosts.allow</b> takes
precedence, and access is allowed. To make a site more secure, you
could put ALL: <b  >ALL</b> in your
<b  >/etc/hosts.deny</b> (to deny access to everyone),
then list in the <b  >/etc/hosts.allow</b> all the hosts
you want to allow in. This way, only the hosts you specify have
access to the services that <b  >tcpd</b> runs. Also, if
you have <span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> a hosts.allow file, and no
<b  >hosts.deny</b> file, <span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> hosts
listed in the <b  >hosts.allow</b> will be allowed any
access at all.</p><p>See the man pages for tcpd(8) and hosts_allow(5) for more
information about how to use <b  >tcpd</b> at your
site.</p><p>Now, how does this all work? Let's add something to our
<b  >/etc/inetd.conf</b>. Something simple and easy, say
a &ldquo;fortune&rdquo; port. Many Linux installations contain the
<b  >/usr/games/fortune</b> command, and a
<b  >qotd</b> (quote of the day) port exists at port 17.
So we'll set <b  >inetd</b> up so that if you
<b  >telnet</b> to port 17, you get the output of the
fortune command. So, log into your machine as root and make sure
that inetd is running. If it is not, you will want to set up TCP/IP
for your machine. Even if you're not connected to anything, you can
still set up the loopback device and connect to yourself.</p><p>First, make sure that qotd is defined in your
/etc/services:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
qotd    17/tcp
</pre><p>Next, we'll add the line in the
<b  >/etc/inetd.conf</b> to make <b  >inetd</b>
start fortune. This can be added anywhere in the
<b  >/etc/inetd.conf</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
qotd stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd \
        /usr/games/fortune
</pre><p>You'll have to restart <b  >inetd</b> to make it re-read
the <b  >inetd.conf</b> file. An easy way that only works
under Linux, but should <span   class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span> work under
Linux, is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
linux:/# killall -HUP inetd
</pre><p>On some systems, the PID of the <b  >inetd</b> process
may be kept in a file, such as
<b  >/var/run/inetd.pid</b>, and on non-Linux systems
without the <b  >inetd.pid</b> file, you will have to use
the <b  >ps</b> command to find the PID of the
<b  >inetd</b> process.</p><p>Now if you telnet to localhost port 17, you'll find something
like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
linux:/# telnet localhost 17
Trying 127.0.0.1
Connected to localhost
Escape character is '^]'.
Money is the root of all wealth
Connection closed by foreign host.
linux:/#
</pre><p>There are only a few programs that you can use for this.
Things that use curses, like <b  >joe</b>, or anything
that uses the SVGAlib, won't work, as it won't be able to open your
tty (remember: to Linux, you're telnetting in from somewhere else).
</p><p>Any programs you do put in your <b  >inetd.conf</b>
file should have good security. This means:</p><p>1) Verify (and modify if necessary) the user that the process
is running under. Many need root privileges, but some don't.</p><p>2) Verify the security of the program that is being connected
to a TCP/IP socket. Something like
<b  >/usr/games/fortune</b> is not interactive, but a
program like the old <b  >sendmail</b> allowed the
Internet worm to wind its way through machines a few years ago.
(Note that the <b  >sendmail</b> bug was fixed.)</p><p>3) Add extra security to <b  >inetd</b> by adding
something like tcpd, which will allow you to deny or allow various
hosts from connecting to your machine. Check the tcpd man pages for
more information about <b  >tcpd</b>.</p><p>Now that you have your services set up, you can hook in your
own services and use them for whatever you want. If you have
