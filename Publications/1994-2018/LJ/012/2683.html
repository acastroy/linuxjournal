saw your magazine I immediately subscribed. I love it.
</p><p>Only ONE downside.</p><p>...continued on page 46 ...continued on page 44</p><p>What's the story with this format? I've got to find it one of
the most annoying techniques that magazines use, and cannot
personally figure out a reason for it. Skipping a page because of a
full page ad is fine-I even scan the ad if it looks interesting.
The Economist, a weekly magazine that calls itself a newspaper and
runs over 100 pages, does NOT do this and I find it much easier to
follow the content and spirit of what the author is trying to get
across. Everyone else is breaking up their articles into linked
lists-a big drag.</p><p>What motivates you to make reading your excellent magazine a
chore?</p><p>&mdash;Graham R.

That's pretty good...</em></span>
</p><p>We do it only as much as is strictly necessary. Several
things determine the need to do this. The first is that we do not
impose exact article length limits on our authors, which means that
the articles don't come out anywhere near even pages much of the
time, and the numbers of advertisements of different sizes may not
fit the empty spaces. The second is that we have decided that all
one page or more articles must start at the top of a page; we tried
not doing that and it looked awful. Another consideration is to
start &ldquo;important&rdquo; articles near the front of the magazine. Readers
expect to find them there but that means that something must be
continued to the back half of the magazine. The last consideration
is that some articles require color, and we have only so many color
pages to work with per issue. The magazine is made up of a number
of 16-page &ldquo;forms&rdquo; or &ldquo;signatures&rdquo; and, in some cases, color is
only present on one side of the form. This means that we have to
link through the color pages for ads and articles that contain
color and then print the non-color material on the other pages.
Right now, printing in all color is not affordable. As our press
run increases the cost of this additional color becomes less
significant. While this will not totally eliminate the &ldquo;linked
list&rdquo; syndrome it will help decrease its frequency.</p><p>When we have more subscribers and advertisers, and can afford
to expand the magazine, our options for laying out each article
will be widened. Our goal is no articles ever split; although this
will probably never be completely possible, we hope to come closer
over time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1036580.0x112e660"></a>Linux in Costa Rica</h2></div></div><p>I want to tell how Linux has helped supporting Costa Rica's
national network.
</p><p>We've installed some Linux name and mail servers in the main
subdomains of our national Internet networks. Linux is now stable
enough for doing administrative chores like nameserving, mail
serving and the like.</p><p>So CRNet (which is the entity coordinating and giving impulse
to our national network) likes the idea of using Linux for these
tasks.</p><p>In fact, places like the Presidential House, the Universidad
Latina (Latin University) and the Veterinary School of the
Universidad Nacional use Linux both as name and mail
servers.</p><p>In the University of Costa Rica (UCR), where I'm working, we
are setting up a Linux box as a temporary and limited
newsserver.</p><p>&mdash;Mario A.
Guerra <a href="mailto:mguerra@cariari.ucr.ac.cr">mguerra@cariari.ucr.ac.cr</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1036580.0x112e978"></a>(Un)supported</h2></div></div><p>I recently decided to purchase a &ldquo;real&rdquo; Linux Distribution.
My prime motivation was the fact that I couldn't seem to get my
very unsupported Procom CDROM mounted. Don't feel bad, it didn't
work under (IN)Coherent, Oh Esse Too, or even well under Windoze.
Procom tech support told me simply &ldquo;We no longer support those old
drives&rdquo;, <span   class="emphasis"><em>click...buzz</em></span>. So I was getting
desperate.
</p><p>I had tried under my old system (Linux 1.0.9), by using the
drivers there. I was under the assumption that most of these drives
are similar, just VAR-ed under different labels. I thought this
might be a Mitsumi. Anyway, I broke down and ordered Release 4 and
a supplement from Trans-Ameritech, mostly because they claimed to
work under any drive DOS could recognise.</p><p>Not only did T-A send the Distribution Release 4 and the July
Supplement, they also included a free copy of the November
supplement with Debian and Bogus and BSD4.4R2.0. (at no extra cost
to me!) Thanks T-A. Unfortunately, the only scheme I could run my
disc from was through UMSDOS running from my true DOS partition. I
didn't have the room, nor did I want to. I already had a root
partition that I wanted. So, I gave up.</p><p>Then, on Martin Luther King Day, I was goofing with the
system and I decided, on a lark, to do a raw scan of the DOS binary
drivers for the Procom drive. I don't know what I was looking for,
but I found it-at the tail of the file was the list of some Sony
500-series drives! I knew this latest distribution had some cdu535
stuff on it, so I forced a boot from loadlin (a story in itself)
and (TaDa!) I could talk to the disc! But, I went from PL 1.1.18
back down to 1.0.9 . I scanned the distribution again and found a
1.1.18 kernel with cdu535 support and setup installed that nicely!
Happy ending! Drop in if you're in the neighborhood and we'll split
a Guiness. Have fun, I know I am. Thanks for doing what the big
boys couldn't do!</p><p>&mdash;Mike

subscription to <i  >LJ</i>. I was happily overwhelmed by the depth of
information your magazine offers. On that note, I have a few
comments/suggestions.
</p><p>1. Since it appears that Linux is achieving some sort of mass
acceptance, it may be in <i  >LJ</i>'s best interest to appeal to many types
of users. I know as much as the next programmer about DOS, more
than most about OS/2, but very little about Linux. And I turn to
your magazine for help. Unfortunately, I find very little
information for the beginning Linux'er. Maybe a beginners column
would help? How about a series of articles that covers installation
considerations, tips, setup help, and a list of the FAQs and where
to get them?</p><p>2. I believe that most experienced *nix users expect new
users to understand how multi-user systems work. They forget that
the &ldquo;I've outgrown Windows&rdquo; crowd will be coming onboard and will
expect to have their hands held and for their installation routines
to handle all the crucial details. My marketing background makes me
keenly aware of how first impressions make or break a sale. And you
can bet your last dime that Microsoft and IBM will be sucking in
new users at a record pace in 1995. So, if you were to include some
new user information in your magazine, I'm sure you'd capture a few
of the wanna-be's.</p><p>Thanks for your time.</p><p>&mdash;Chris
Freyer <a href="mailto:cfreyer@gate.net">cfreyer@gate.net</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1036580.0x112f000"></a><i  >LJ</i> Responds:</h2></div></div><p>1. Part of the problem has been finding authors
interested in writing beginning material. We now have several
authors interested in this, and more beginning articles will start
showing up. Keep your eyes peeled.
</p><p>2. The first impression means a lot. However, we can't beat
the MS marketing machine at its own job. Instead, I think that
Linux is and will be for those who have become dissatisfied with MS
and (to a lesser extent) IBM. I'm not going to bet that Linux will
ever blow MS out of the market. Instead, I'd like it to be the best
possible thing for those who are frustrated with the
alternatives.</p></div></div>
