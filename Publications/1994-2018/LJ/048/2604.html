this book is not for you. However, if you need a
platform-independent general overview of Internet/Intranet security
issues, Mr. Goncalves uses a conversational tone and an abundance
of resources to help you get a firm grasp of the basics.</p><p>There are many web sites that are unprotected and unsecured.
This may be due to a system administrator who is over tasked and
does not have enough research time, who is new to a particular
operating system or who just does not know how important security
is. The author provides good, basic information on what the
security needs may be and how to balance cost of security against
availability of services. Individual chapters give introductions to
financial issues, strategies for different web site platforms and
implementing services like conferencing, e-mail, FTP, NNTP and
HTTP.</p><p>There is also plenty of material written in non-technical
language. This can be very useful when trying to educate upper
management on basic security issues and why they need to be funded.
The whole book provides many information sites, including 77 pages
of appendices giving resources for firewall products, web server
products, authentication, password and other administrative tools.
This may be the best part of the book, to help you quickly see what
sort of material is available for your operating system.</p><p>There are a few things I did not like about the book. The
editing and proofreading could have been better. I generally read
too quickly to find spelling or grammatical errors, but I found
some here. Also, several sections left me wondering what I was
supposed to have learned. My most abundant gripe is the
nondifferentiation between &ldquo;hackers&rdquo; and &ldquo;crackers&rdquo;. I consider
myself a junior hacker, yet one of the most law abiding people I
know. Hackers play with code and try to create; crackers
intrude&mdash;hopefully the media will soon understand the difference.
There is also the ubiquitous CD-ROM; this one contains an
evaluation copy of an NT-based logging and reporting system.
Nothing for the Unix/Linux crowd.</p><p>The book's target audience is those who need a very basic
introduction with a lot of resources. It meets that market well,
but most <i  >Linux Journal</i> readers will be
somewhat more advanced. For $49 US, get this book only if you are
certain it meets your particular needs. Otherwise, do a lot of web
surfing and find a book tailored to your specific operating system
and level of expertise.</p></div></div>
