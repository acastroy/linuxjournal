    An introduction to a program written by Mr. Grimaldo to
    manage system logs.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2704580.0x27fc4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of the attributes that characterizes
Unix systems, and therefore Linux, is true multitasking. Because of
it, there are usually many processes running on your machine,
including the not-so-evil daemons and other important programs such
as <span   class="bold"><b>uucico</b></span> (Unix-to-Unix copy-in
copy-out). If your system is properly configured, those programs
leave traces of their activities in the system logs. These logs
usually contain lots of data that must be filtered to generate more
readable reports. In the case of system problems, these logs are a
valuable source of information for tracking, and possibly solving,
the problem.
</p><p>Years ago, when I was faced with the prospect of spending
some of my free time looking through raw logs and trimming them so
that they wouldn't eat up disk space, I decided it was time to take
action&mdash;I wrote the program
<span   class="bold"><b>Chklogs</b></span>. ChkLogs is an acronym for
&ldquo;Check Logs&rdquo; in the Unix tradition.</p><p>Whether you are an experienced Linux user, system
administrator or a newcomer to the Linux world, you will certainly
find this subject of interest. Although it is mainly a system
administration tool, it also has applications in the user
world.</p><p>In this article I will introduce you to version 2.0 of
Chklogs which should be out by the time this is published.
Currently version 1.9 release/build 2 (1.9-2) is available, which
is the last Perl 4.0x compatible version. Version 2.0 and higher
require Perl 5.003&mdash;which is not much to ask considering about 99%
of registered users have that Perl version.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2704580.0x27fc768"></a>Features</h2></div></div><p>Here are some of the features offered by Chklogs:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Individual specification of thresholds and
action(s) for each log</p></li><li><p>A choice of compression program</p></li><li><p>Log management by size or age</p></li><li><p>Addition of user extensions</p></li><li><p>Logical Log Groups with pre- and
post-processing</p></li><li><p>Global and local repositories (Alternate Repository
feature)</p></li><li><p>Log shuffling (also known as log rotation)</p></li><li><p>Directory lumping</p></li><li><p>Requires no programming experience</p></li><li><p>User resource file</p></li><li><p>Fully based on Perl 5.003, except for the user
interface</p></li><li><p>Nice Tcl/Tk user interface, available separately
(See Resources at the end of this article.)</p></li></ul></div><p>Logical Log Groups are groups of logs that have something in
common; this could be a collection of UUCP logs, INN logs or
anything you consider a group. You can use virtually any name; the
only restriction is that the name must be valid to create a
directory. Chklogs has two built-in groups: syslog and common
(reserved).</p><p>Alternate Repository (AR) is a directory where the archived
logs are stored after they have been processed if they met the
threshold condition. By default, archived logs are created with
<span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> and GNU
<span   class="bold"><b>zip</b></span>. A local AR is a directory
named OldLogs under the directory in which the log resides. A
global AR is a directory hierarchy (you define the root of this AR)
where log archives are divided into logical groups. Here, you will
always see the &ldquo;common&rdquo; subdirectory where all &ldquo;orphan&rdquo; logs
go, i.e., those that have not been explicitly declared to belong to
a group.</p><p>Log Shuffling is well known and is also called log rotation.
The &ldquo;phased-out&rdquo; log is assigned a number or tag each time until
a maximum is reached, at which point the oldest one is
removed.</p><p>Directory Lumping is another nice feature. Instead of
specifying each log separately by name, you supply a directory
name. Chklogs treats any non-archived, non-directory file (as
recognized by Chklogs) as a log and acts on it according to the
action specification. A real-world application of this option is a
site that gives UUCP access to a large number of subdomains (very
cumbersome to do by hand), and a separate UUCP transfer log is kept
for each site. Chklogs always determines first if you have
specified a directory or a file.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2704580.0x27fd318"></a>Installing Chklogs</h2></div></div><p>Every time I make the first release/build of a new version
(e.g., v2.0-1), I submit it to Sunsite and Funet FTP sites.
Whenever a fix is required (and therefore no new features), I put
out a new release/build (e.g., 2.0-2) only on the primary site, my
ISP. To make sure that you have the latest version, check out the
primary site and/or the Chklogs web page at
http://www.iaehv.nl/users/grimaldo/info/.</p><p>Now, get &ldquo;version 2.0 build 1&rdquo; installed on your system.
Unpack it and go to the root of the directory tree:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gunzip chklogs-2.0-1.tar.gz
tar xvf chklogs-2.0-1.tar
cd chklogs-2.0-1
</pre><p>Under the root tree is the bin directory containing the
scripts and modules which comprise the Chklogs package. The /doc
directory contains all the necessary documentation, including man
pages in both troff and HTML format. A plug-out directory contains
some extra utilities to scan your logs&mdash;use them as is or as
examples to build your own. Last is the /contrib directory. In the
root of the tree there is the README file, release notes, a
makefile for installation and, most important, the GuideMe script.
Type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
GuideMe
</pre>


And it will do just that or at least make the attempt . This script
performs a probe into your system and indicates which configuration
parameters must be changed in which files. Follow its advice
closely. In the end, it will ask you if you wish to send in your
registration. If you select &ldquo;no&rdquo; that's fine. If &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, you
will receive mail regarding updates and major fixes.
</p><p>Assuming you have made the necessary configuration parameter
changes (mailer, compress program, administrative account, library
location, Perl location etc.), you are now ready to actually make
Chklogs work for your system. I will also assume it has been
installed (see Makefile) in /usr/local/sbin and
/usr/local/lib/Degt/ by the <span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span>
command (<b  >make install</b>). The same library
directory is shared by the graphical user interface.</p><p>If you are not yet sure you wish to commit your logs to
Chklogs, you should make a back-up copy of them in a local
directory. Run Chklogs on those copies until you feel safe, and you
will. Doing this requires use of the resource file (see
below).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2704580.0x27fd6e0"></a>Chklogs Configuration</h2></div></div><p>The Chklogs package consists of an administrative program
(<span   class="bold"><b>chklogsadm</b></span>), the main program
(<span   class="bold"><b>chklogs</b></span>) and some Perl modules
(Smtp.pm, Chklogs.pm, Interp.pm). For the second part of the
configuration, we need the Chklogs configuration file
(chklogs.conf) and, optionally, the resource file.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2704580.0x27fd898"></a>The Personal Resource File</h2></div></div><p>The resource file (.chklogsrc) resides in your home
directory. You need it if you wish to first test on a copy of your
logs or if you don't have root permissions (therefore, not used for
the system logs but for others). When Chklogs runs, it first gets
configuration information that is coded in the scripts
configuration variables (the configuration section is clearly
marked in the source), then it looks for a Personal Resource File
(PRF) and then the command-line options, in that order.</p><p>In the PRF you can override some variables from the script
configuration, for example, the admin user and others. Here is an
example provided in the distribution:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Personal resource file for Chklogs 2.x
set ChklogsConf ~/devel/test/chklogs.conf
set ChklogsDb ~grimaldo/devel/test/.chklogsdb
set VarRun  ~/devel/test
set RelativePath MyOldLogs
set Admin  grimaldo
mode ignore on
set SyslogConf /etc/syslog.conf
</pre><p>You will notice it has a syntax similar to Tcl. That is, with
the exception of the mode lines, everything between <b  >ignore
on</b> and <b  >ignore off</b> is not interpreted.
The Tcl/Tk GUI does have a dummy mode routine, but all variable
settings are performed as this ignore mode is only meaningful in
the Perl mode. Personally, I find the dollar sign in front of
normal variables annoying. This same resource file (with some
extensions) is used by the GUI. The PRF example from above does not
show the variables that are used exclusively by the GUI. However,
for the examples in this article, I will assume you are working on
the actual logs and not a copy.
</p><p>In the above script, all variables are overrides for the
internal configuration variables. ChklogsConf indicates the
location of the configuration file (introduced in the next
section), ChklogsDb is the internal database (you must never edit
or move this file around), and VarRun is the directory where the
PID lock files are kept (including where to find Syslog's and
Chklogs' PID file). RelativePath is used when you choose the local
repository, and Admin is the e-mail address where the reports are
sent when the mail command-line option is specified. Normally, I
don't need this file when running Chklogs, but I do use it during
testing as a non-privileged user.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2704580.0x27fdbb0"></a>The Configuration File</h2></div></div><p><a href="2363l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> is a sample
configuration file demonstrating the various features. This file
contains three types of lines: comments/spacers, directives and
specifications. It is divided into two major sections, the header
and the body:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A <span   class="bold"><b>directive</b></span> line
begins with the two characters <b  >#:</b> and because
this pattern is checked first, it is not confused for a
comment.</p></li><li><p>A <span   class="bold"><b>comment</b></span> line is
introduced by the <b  >#</b> character. Note that you
cannot have comments at the end of a specification line.</p></li><li><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>specification</b></span>
line is any line that is not empty or a directive or comment. It
defines the attributes for each of the logs you wish ChkLogs to
manage.</p></li></ul></div><p>The header is comprised of the comment lines that identify
this configuration for a particular host, and the two directive
lines which must appear in the order shown. The header can be
created with either of the following two administrative
commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chklogsadm newconf -global /var/log/Chklogs
</pre><p>or
<pre     class="programlisting">
chklogsadm newconf -local
</pre>


The first directive (<b  >options</b>) is used to set
global options for this configuration. At present only two option
names are recognized, and both deal with the Alternate Repository
Feature explained earlier. The two acceptable options are
<b  >global</b> and <b  >local</b>. The second
directive (<b  >global</b>) is also related to the
Alternate Repository. It must be set to the root directory where
the logs are going to be archived (i.e., those with &ldquo;archive&rdquo;
attribute) by group hierarchy.
</p><p>In the instruction section or body, we find mostly
specification lines. These lines follow a particular syntax:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
LogName Threshold Action [Parameter(s)]
</pre><p>The first field is a fully-qualified log name, the second is
a threshold that can be a size or age. The size must be in bytes
or, optionally, append the K qualifier for kilobytes. If you opt
for an age, it must be in days by appending a D (e.g., 7d) or in
months by appending an M (e.g., 2m). The qualifiers D, M and K are
case insensitive. The log is always compared to the threshold, if
it is reached then the specified &ldquo;Action&rdquo; is taken.
</p><p>The Action field can have a value of archive, execute or
truncate, which has no arguments, Chklogs uses the
<span   class="bold"><b>truncate</b></span> system call to chop the
file to a length of zero. Use this option if you don't care about
this log or after you have used the log with either the archive or
execute options as shown in Listing 1.</p><p>The archive action takes one parameter that indicates how
many logs to keep archived before rotating/shuffling. If no
parameter is given, an internal one is used (see documentation).
Use this option, if you plan to look at this log at a later
time.</p><p>The execute action is used to spawn a plug-out, that is, an
external program that will operate on the log. This is useful if
you have a particular log scanner that will filter the log and give
you a human-readable report. You can specify as many parameters as
you wish, the special parameter <b  >%L</b> is replaced
by Chklogs with the full name of the log and is used to inform the
plug-out which file to process.</p><p>Listing 1 also shows a Logical Group definition. There, a
group named NetNews is created so that, if a global alternate
repository is used, there will be a NetNews directory under it in
addition to the /common directory. For each group, you can
associate an external program to execute in the plug-out interface.
Parameters are allowed, but <b  >%L</b> is meaningless in
that context. Pre and Post specify which program to execute before
and after the group has been processed respectively. A group
definition always starts with the three directive lines in that
order, then one or several logs and, finally, an empty line or a
comment line. Do not include any of these in between the lines of
the group definition.</p><p>In the case of the sample NetNews group, we want the daemon
to stop using the logs before we touch them and restart (or
continue) after we are finished. This is particularly useful for
INN (which has a program to control the daemon) and HTTP. Chklogs
handles syslog automatically; it knows what to do and how to do
it.</p><p>Finally, notice that the last specification line refers to a
directory as explained earlier in the Directory Lumping
section.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2704580.0x2bf6a60"></a>Setting Up the Environment</h2></div></div><p>Once you have created your first configuration file, you need
to have Chklogs initialize its internal database (not to be
confused with configuration) specified by either the configuration
variable ResrcFile (for historic reasons) or the Personal Resource
File's ChklogsDb variable. Remember, initialization overwrites any
previous history so should be done only after the first
installation (rather than when you make changes to add/remove
logs/groups). Use the following administrative command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chklogsadm init
</pre><p>Then, issue the administrative command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
chklogsadm initrepos
</pre>


to initialize all the alternate repositories. Unlike
<b  >init</b>, you must execute this command each time
you create a new group or change the location of your alternate
repository (the global parameter). All of these steps are explained
in detail in the documentation provided with the package.
</p><p>Finally, the <b  >sync</b> option of chklogsadm is
needed whenever you make a modification to the configuration file
(chklogs.conf). This is not done automatically because it is not
very effective if several modifications are made to the file
consecutively. This operation is as simple as typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chklogsadm sync
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2704580.0x2bf6dd0"></a>The Plug-out Interface</h2></div></div><p>Chklogs comes with several plug-outs. I use them to generate
statistics on my UUCP logs, listserver log, etc. You can build your
own plug-outs, and in fact I would like to hear about any log
scanners or filters you have. Available plug-outs are stored in the
/plug-out and /contrib directories.</p><p>A plug-out is any external program executed by Chklogs in the
Pre/Post group directives or the execute actions. This program must
not generate any output on stdout/stderr as it will clutter the
report, and if you, like most users, run Chklogs with a
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> job, then this sort of
behavior is undesirable. So, do you have a nice scanner that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> write to stdout/stderr and don't want to
hack it up? Or don't know a thing about programming? Simply use the
<span   class="bold"><b>cdkwrap</b></span> wrapper provided in the
distribution, and it will capture all the output and mail it to
you.</p><p>Also, the plugged-out child inherits certain environment
variables that provide useful information:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>CDKLOG: The fully-qualified log name</p></li><li><p>CDKROOT: The archive repository</p></li><li><p>CDKMAILTO: The e-mail address for mailing the
report</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2704580.0x2bf72f8"></a>Running Chklogs from the Command-Line</h2></div></div><p>Now, we have finished our setup; we have a configuration
file, a resource file and initialized repositories. The
administrative tasks are done for now (you can make changes later,
if needed), and we are ready to get down to the action. Chklogs has
several command-line options, some of which can be combined to
achieve a particular effect. I won't cover all of them, or even all
of the possibilities, but I will discuss enough of them to enable
you to begin, and to acquaint you with a few of its capabilities.
Note that we will now be using the chklogs program, not the
administrative program, chklogsadm.</p><p>Basically, there are four major actions you can
perform:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Check the configuration file.</p></li><li><p>Get an overview of all the logs that are
archived.</p></li><li><p>Obtain a report of actions to be taken when you
execute the program.</p></li><li><p>Perform the actions as directed on the
configuration file.</p></li></ol></div><p>To check the correctness of the configuration file (although
the check is not very thorough) use the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chklogs -w
</pre><p>For a quick overview of which logs are archived into the
repositories, there is the <b  >-l</b> command line
option:
<pre     class="programlisting">
chklogs -l
</pre>


This gives you an indication of how many logs you need to scan or
filter and needed information in case something suspicious happens
on your system.
</p><p>To get the usual log report indicating whether a log is still
within its threshold, and if not, what action would be performed,
use the <b  >-w</b> option:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chklogs -w [-m]
</pre><p>Alternatively, you can also specify the <b  >-m</b>
(mail) option to mail the report. You cannot put them on the same
switch (<b  >-wm</b>).
</p><p>Finally, when you want Chklogs to actually process your logs
as specified in the configuration file, simply use it without any
of the above options:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chklogs [-m]
</pre><p>A report is produced on standard output unless you use the
mail (<b  >-m</b>) option. Mail is the most frequently
used option.
</p><p>Most users make an entry into the /etc/crontab file so that
Chklogs runs every day at a particular time and mails the report. A
typical crontab entry looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# System Cron Tab
45 23 * * * root /usr/local/sbin/chklogs -m
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2704580.0x2bf7d48"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>I hope that you, too, will find Chklogs to be a useful
package and will soon incorporate it into your system
administration tool box. It is used by the Linux community and by
most of the other major Unices (I counted 9 different flavors in my
last scan of the registration database), for small home systems,
service providers and other major network providers. I am always
available by e-mail for suggestions, and if there is a problem I
always give an answer. A standard form for reporting problems is
provided with the distribution to ease my task. I would like to
thank all of those who have sent suggestions and encouraging
e-mail, as well as problem reports. It has been a great experience
to provide this free software to the community. Chklogs is
&ldquo;postcard-ware&rdquo;; I collect them.</p></div></div>
