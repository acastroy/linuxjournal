    Linux is readily establishing itself in the biomedical field
    as a powerful and reliable system for research computing.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c4b580.0x1d43500"></a></h2></div></div><p>The boom in biomedical research over the
past decade has occurred as a result of increased demands for
better health care and greater understanding of the biomolecular
mechanisms responsible for many diseases. Fueling many of the
scientific advances in medicine have been the corresponding
developments in computational processing power and speed. In
addition to the large-scale data collection and processing required
to understand complex biological and physiological processes, our
ability to analyze and model medical phenomena at microscopic and
macroscopic levels is reliant upon the systems used for these
computationally intensive jobs. Linux systems are receiving
recognition as ideal workhorses for performing many of these tasks.
</p><p>To better understand the emerging biomedical applications of
Linux, it is first necessary to examine the typical computational
requirements and resources of many biomedical research centers. The
popular perception of biology and medicine is that they are wet and
gushy sciences, involving little or no quantitative or numerical
analysis. In fact, this couldn't be farther from the truth. There
is a concerted effort among scientists to bring the biomedical
sciences into the realm of other quantitative disciplines. This
effort is illustrated by the recent emergence or increasing
prominence of fields such as bioinformatics and genomic-sequence
databases, biomolecular modeling and computer-aided drug design,
diagnostic medical imaging, epidemiology and biostatistical
analyses of patient populations, as well as medical informatics and
patient record databases.</p><p>The systems used by researchers in these fields span a
spectrum of different platforms. One typically finds an abundant
assortment of Intel and Power PC-based systems running the Windows
and Mac operating systems for performing basic tasks such as text
processing, routine data analysis, e-mail and Internet access. In
addition, the recent trend among manufacturers has been to
interface a broad range of biomedical research equipment with PCs
for the ease of GUI instrument control and data collection. The
choice of which platform should be employed for such interfaces is
usually the decision of the equipment manufacturer and not the
researcher.</p><p>Laboratories may also contain a few Unix workstations which
are used to process large jobs, drive complex instrumentation or
function as servers. Typically these machines are dedicated to
specific tasks and are unavailable for general use.</p><p>One unfortunate aspect of this heterogeneous situation is
that it creates headaches for system administrators. Such a wide
variety of systems performing a multitude of different tasks and
operated by a large number of users with a wide range of computer
abilities, frequently spells disaster.</p><p>Linux serves as an ideal system for biomedical research
laboratories, where there is an abundance of PCs, strict limits on
the allocation of research funds and a need for significant
processing power in conjunction with straightforward and flexible
system customization. The stability of Linux, its
cost-effectiveness and large user community make it attractive to
both novice and experienced system administrators confined by tight
research computing budgets. In addition, the ability of the various
incarnations of Linux to run on a wide variety of platforms
provides a uniform OS and networking capabilities for the mixture
of different machines already in existence at many biomedical
research centers.</p><p>Utilization of Linux systems is emerging within the
Biomolecular Structure Group here at Harvard Medical School.
Intel-based systems running Red Hat Linux have recently been
implemented for simultaneous control and data collection from x-ray
diffraction instruments (Figure 1). Individual data sets obtained
with these instruments are about 100MB in size and are used to
understand the atomic structure of biomolecules and for drug-design
studies at the molecular level. Although the source code for
driving and collecting data on the x-ray instrument had to be
recompiled for Linux and the kernel was rebuilt, the result was a
very stable system for performing this specialized and complex
task. In this instance, the Linux system has successfully replaced
a more expensive Silicon Graphics workstation.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2380f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>Granted, the above application of Linux is rather specific,
but Linux is also gaining more widespread usage among individual
researchers. Installation of Linux on PCs in conjunction with
either the Windows or Mac operating systems gives users the choice
of the appropriate system with which to complete a job, while
sitting at the same machine. For example, in a laboratory with an
abundance of Macintoshes, the recently developed MkLinux for Power
PC has proven to be beneficial in providing greater access to
remote Unix systems and applications. More individuals are now able
to use popular GUIs for genomic databases, bioinformatics
applications, and biomolecular visualization software located on
remote servers, while taking advantage of the multitasking
capabilities of Linux (Figure 2). In addition, through
implementation of a simple Tcl/Tk script, general users have the
ability to reboot the machine back into Mac OS with a click of a
button. In some cases, individuals are using the Linux systems as
nothing more than X terminals. However, this use alone is valuable,
since it provides increased access to applications located on a
limited number of servers without having to purchase additional X
terminals or X terminal emulation software.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2380f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Multitasking with Linux
</p></div></div><p>Linux is bound to have a more prominent role in biomedical
research computing in the future. The recent installations of Linux
systems described above have already been recognized as highly
successful and even superior to other systems, in terms of both
price and performance. As the computing demands of biomedical
research increase, scientists, system administrators, software
developers and instrument manufacturers will all be considering
Linux.</p></div></div>
