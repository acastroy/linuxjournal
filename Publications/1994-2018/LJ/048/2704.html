My friend suggested using <span   class="bold"><b>kerneld</b></span>
to make modules of the ZIP drive and my printer so that I can load
the ZIP drive, access it, then unload it to use my printer. How
would I go about doing this?</p><p>&mdash;Scott Bell Red Hat 4.2</p><p>There is no need to do this. All the modules you need are
already available from the stock install. To access your parallel
port ZIP drive simply run:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
insmod ppa
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>as root. You will then have your ZIP drive
available as /dev/sda if you don't have any other SCSI devices on
your system. When done with the ZIP, make sure everything is
unmounted. Then run:</em></span>
<pre     class="programlisting">
rmmod ppa
</pre>


<span   class="emphasis"><em>as root. You can then unplug it, plug your printer in and
use the printer as you normally would (kerneld should load that
module automatically). If you have further questions or need help,
install the kernel-source RPM and see
/usr/src/linux/drivers/scsi/README.ppa and the SCSI-HOWTO for more
details.</em></span>

that keep sending me xmelt, xroach and xsnow. Unfortunately, I need
to keep all my network connections open. Is there a way to find and
kill processes that are sent to my display? Also, is it possible to
reroute these processes back to the display they came from?</p><p>&mdash;Ray Banez Red Hat 4.2</p><p>Type <b  >ps -ax</b> to get the process ID which is
on the left side of the output, then type<b  >kill -9
&lt;process ID&gt;</b>. Now to keep this from happening again
make use of the <span   class="bold"><b>xhost</b></span> command. It
will allow you to deny X sessions from hosts you don't
want(<b  >xhost -unwanted_machinename</b>).</p><p>&mdash;Mark Bishop, Vice President Southern Illinois Linux Users
Group mark@vincent.silug.org</p><p>You should restrict access to your display. If you access
your display locally you could just deny remote access to shell
accounts on the workstation; otherwise, look at the docs about
<span   class="bold"><b>xauth</b></span> and use it to authenticate
graphic programs. This way only your own programs will be able to
use your graphic display. If you share your account with other
people, on the other hand, there's no solution to the
problem.</p><p>Routing the processes back to the display they came from is
not possible. You must block intruders before they get in or kill
them afterwards.</p><p>&mdash;Alessandro Rubini rubini@linux.it</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2755580.0x284d9d0"></a>kcore File</h2></div></div><p>What is the kcore file in /proc directory? The file size is
growing out of control. Can I delete it?</p><p>&mdash;Kai Lien, Pharm.D. Red Hat 4.1</p><p>This is a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; file, reflecting your memory. It
doesn't exist at all on your hard disk, like all of /proc, so it
can't and shouldn't be deleted!</p><p>&mdash;Ralf W. Stephan ralf@ark.franken.de</p><p>Perhaps a short explanation of the /proc file system is in
order. The /proc file system is a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; file system. It
doesn't actually reside on any sort of physical device.
<span   class="bold"><b>/proc</b></span> is a means of examining what
is going on inside the Linux kernel without having to resort to a
lot of programming. <span   class="bold"><b>/proc/kcore</b></span> is
actually all of the memory that is in use on your system. Even if
you could delete it, you wouldn't want to. Don't worry about the
&ldquo;size&rdquo; of kcore. It's actually not affecting any of your
drives.</p><p>I strongly encourage you to explore the files in the /proc
file system, preferably as a non-root user. By looking inside these
files, you can learn a lot about how your system is configured,
what it is doing and how certain things work. As long as you aren't
poking around as root, it's very difficult to mess anything
up.</p><p>&mdash;Keith Stevenson k.stevenson@louisville.edu</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2755580.0x284dd98"></a>Migrating to Linux</h2></div></div><p>I am currently trying to migrate an ISP's radius
authentication server from FreeBSD to Linux (not distribution
specific, but using Debian). The /etc/passwd file from FreeBSD is
using MD5 encryption. The default scheme for Linux is the DES-like
scheme. FreeBSD states, correctly, that the scheme may be switched
to MD5 by changing the sym-links in /usr/lib from libcrypt to
libscrypt. I cannot find a solution of this nature for any Linux
distribution, though at this level there should not be any
distribution specificity. I know of at least one ISP with a similar
problem between BSD and Linux. I am not alone.</p><p>&mdash;Michael Roark Generic</p><p>Transferring passwords between different operating systems
can be a major problem. The difficulty lies in the fact that
passwords are encrypted in a one-way fashion. You have to know the
password in order to decrypt it. Here is what I have done in a
similar situation.</p><p>1) Write a program wrapper around your login program that
will capture the userid and password of your users before passing
the information to your authentication server.</p><p>2) Use this file of clear-text userid and password
combinations to set up the authentication database on the new
system.</p><p>If you are unable or unwilling to do this, find out whether
or not freeBSD and Linux use the same crypt function for storing
passwords. If so, set freeBSD to use the crypt function instead of
MD5. Accelerate the rate of password expirations so all of your
users have to change their passwords (assuming you use password
expiration). After all of the passwords have been changed, simply
copy the encrypted passwords from the freeBSD box to the
appropriate place on the Linux box. This will not work unless
freeBSD and Linux use the same crypt function.</p><p>You may also want to take a look at Red Hat Linux. I think
that the PAM security system bundled with it may support MD5
passwords. If so, you can copy them directly.</p><p>&mdash;Keith Stevenson k.stevenson@louisville.edu</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2755580.0x284e108"></a>minicom Configuration Problem</h2></div></div><p>My machine is a p75 with a Fujitsu hard drive and a Hayes
Accura 56kflex external modem. I have 4 partitions: MS-DOS,
Caldera, Red Hat and swap. I have a mouse on com1 and a modem on
com2. The modem works fine in DOS. In Linux, when I go into X and
start <span   class="bold"><b>seyon</b></span>, an AT returns &ldquo;ok&rdquo;
and I can dial out and get a response from a BBS or my ISP.</p><p>When I go into minicom, it does not dial out. I wait for a
couple of retries and then exit minicom. As soon as I exit, minicom
dials out.</p><p>If I open minicom in a vt the same thing happens. In all
cases the modem init light comes on, but there is no dialing until
I exit from minicom.</p><p>Can someone please tell me where I am going wrong? No one has
been able to help&mdash;not Hayes, not the Caldera help line, not any of
the lists where I posed the question. Any suggestions will be much
appreciated.</p><p>&mdash;Ted Wager</p><p>Ok, you have a problem with minicom's config somewhere. Now I
could be more helpful if I knew if an init string came up or just
the familiar &ldquo;Press <b  >ctrl-A Z</b> for help on
special settings.&rdquo; My advice to you is go through the settings and
make sure minicom is set up as it should be. (Usually it is set to
/dev/modem assuming /dev/modem is a symbolic link to /dev/cua1.)
Check your serial port settings and check your init string.</p><p>&mdash;Mark Bishop, Vice President Southern Illinois Linux Users

big. I deleted it, then created a new one with
<span   class="bold"><b>touch</b></span>. The new file's permissions
are identical to the original.</p><p>But now, /usr/sbin/syslogd will not run for more than about
two minutes. No data is logged to /var/adm/messages anymore. What
have I done?</p><p>&mdash;Bill Cunningham Slackware</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>syslogd</b></span> sometimes doesn't
like it if the files it has open for writing are modified. Sending
SIGHUP (<b  >kill -HUP</b>) is usually enough to make it
start writing to the file again.</p><p>Incidentally, I use the program
<span   class="bold"><b>logrotate</b></span> to manage my syslog
files. It trims them as necessary, archives old files and restarts
syslogd as needed after working on the log files. It has made log
file management much easier for me.</p><p>&mdash;Keith Stevenson k.stevenson@louisville.edu</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2755580.0x284e8f0"></a>Multi-threaded Applications</h2></div></div><p>I want to program multi-threaded applications. Kernel threads
are available, I know. But how about thread-safe versions of much
used libraries (libc and tcpip communications)?</p><p>&mdash;Peter Boncz Generic</p><p>You can try the LinuxThreads library, which is a free,
kernel-level implementation of POSIX 1003.1c threads under Linux
(based on the <span   class="bold"><b>clone</b></span> system call).
