days. The proof is in the number of articles and article
suggestions that I receive every month. The majority of these
articles describe how Linux is being used at work by a surprisingly
varied group of authors from all over the world. Usually we print
only one of these &ldquo;Linux Means Business&rdquo; articles each month, but
this month we focus on workplace solutions and give you five
feature articles of this type. We have even more but there is just
not enough space for all of them, so we will continue to publish
one each month. We also have a few product reviews to help you
select office applications that support Linux.</p><p>Last year there were several news items proving that Linux is
being taken seriously by the big companies. At the LISA'97
Conference in San Diego in October, <i  >LJ</i>'s
publisher, Phil Hughes, talked to a programmer who is porting Linux
to SGI hardware. UMAX Technologies invested in VA Research, a
company that sells its computers with Linux installed, even though
UMAX is also a manufacturer of PowerMac clones. In Canada, Corel
Computer Corporation announced that Linux will be the operating
system installed on their new Video Network computer. We have an
interview with Corel's President, Mr. Eid Eid, in this
issue.</p><p>Another item of note is that Netscape has announced that
Communicator 4.04 will include JDK 1.1 with support for Linux. This
is definitely a step in the right direction, since Netscape has not
provided any kind of support for Linux before. This is most likely
due to the fact that Caldera is providing a Linux version of
Netscape in their OpenLinux Standard.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x209b580.0x2193348"></a>A Brief Note</h2></div></div><p>As I am writing this in January, Microsoft is again being
charged with unfair business practices, this time for bundling
Internet Explorer with its Windows operating system. I must admit
to brief sympathy on this one&mdash;I mean, Microsoft did announce in
the beginning that this was their plan, and no one objected until
it became a reality. However, I lost all sympathy when yesterday
(and I paraphrase here) the Microsoft spokesman was asked if he
truly thought that when the judge said Microsoft should supply a
Windows version without IE, the judge meant for Microsoft to supply
a version that didn't work, and the spokesman said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; You
have to wonder what these guys are thinking.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x209b580.0x2193450"></a>Upcoming Events</h2></div></div><p>Some upcoming Linux events that you might be interested in
