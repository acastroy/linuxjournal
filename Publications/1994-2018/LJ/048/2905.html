 One of the strangest and most disorienting feelings to experience
is waking up and realizing you're making history. I had that
feeling the day of Netscape's bombshell announcement on January 23,
1998. They announced they would be releasing the source for
Navigator 5.0. I think the Linux community as a whole is having
that same experience now.</p><p>Netscape's Chief Technology Officer told me, &ldquo;On behalf of
everyone at Netscape, I want to thank you for helping us get to
this point in the first place. Your thinking and writings [&ldquo;The
Cathedral and the Bazaar&rdquo;,
http://www.earthspace.net/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/] were
fundamental inspirations to our decision.&rdquo; That made me feel
pretty good&mdash;I think the best part wasn't the praise for me, it was
the astonishing victory for the Linux culture that it
represents.</p><p>My paper only explains the bazaar development model; I didn't
create or discover it. The bazaar model was grounded in old-time
Unix tradition that has been brought to full fruition by Linus
Torvalds and the thousands of Linux volunteers out there who made
it work. Netscape's move is a victory for <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>
of us&mdash;and, perhaps, a harbinger of greater victories to come if we
work hard and smart.</p><p>Yes, I know Netscape's maneuver was partly one of
desperation. Microsoft's Internet Explorer has been winning the
marketing war. Netscape's stock price had been dropping. Netscape
had to change the rules to stay in the game. But forced or not, the
change matters a lot&mdash;and Wall Street knows it, because Netscape's
stock has since been rising.</p><p>Netscape people chose <span   class="emphasis"><em>our</em></span> rules because
they believe in them. Ten days after the announcement, I flew to
Silicon Valley at Netscape's invitation for a day-long strategy
meeting at which we tried to hammer out solutions to the problems
the company will face in making the bazaar model work. One thing I
heard over and over from their people was a huge sense of
relief&mdash;almost gratitude that market conditions had gotten so bad
that they could justify doing what they wanted to do anyway.</p><p>Within hours after the strategy session, I was briefing a
standing-room-only crowd of over 200 at the Silicon Valley Linux
Users Group meeting. I told them that within the next eight weeks,
Netscape would be posting its proposed source license on the Web
for public comment from the hacker community.</p><p>Also, I explained why I flew out to help Netscape without
charging them a dime&mdash;because, like it or not, Netscape has put
<span   class="emphasis"><em>our</em></span> prestige on the line, too. If Netscape
screws up its implementation, the free-software model will be so
thoroughly discredited that it could be more than a decade before
corporate America is willing to try it again. We've all got to be
Netscape's allies now, because for our sake they
<span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> win.</p><p>Before and during my trip to the Valley, I got together with
a good many of the Linux community's tribal elders, including Linus
Torvalds, John &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall, Bruce Perens, Larry Augustin, Dan
Quinlan, Phil Hughes and others. We're all acutely conscious that
it's crunch time&mdash;the long-awaited breakout of free software into
the commercial world is happening, it's happening
<span   class="emphasis"><em>now</em></span>, and the decisions we make in the next few
months will be absolutely critical.</p><p>One conclusion we've already reached is that the term &ldquo;free
software&rdquo; is itself a problem. The problem with it is twofold.
First, it's confusing; the term &ldquo;free&rdquo; is very ambiguous
(something the Free Software Foundation's propaganda has to wrestle
with constantly). Does &ldquo;free&rdquo; mean &ldquo;no money charged&rdquo;? Does it
mean &ldquo;free to be modified by anyone&rdquo;? Or something else?</p><p>Second, the term makes a lot of corporate types nervous.
While that does not intrinsically bother me in the least, we now
see an opportunity to convert business people rather than thumbing
our noses at them. Netscape's announcement and the buzz in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wall Street
Journal</em></span> and elsewhere means we have a window of
opportunity. If we don't exploit it, the window will close&mdash;but if
we do, and do it right, we can make serious gains in the mainstream
business world. A better label will position us to do that without
compromising our ideals and commitment to technical
excellence.</p><p>We did a lot of brainstorming about this issue and came up
with a happy result. We suggest that everywhere we have previously
talked about &ldquo;free software&rdquo;, we now say &ldquo;open
source&rdquo;--open-source software&mdash;the open-source model, the
open-source culture, the Debian Open Source Guidelines. Eventually,
creating an open-source branding program for commercial vendors who
want to play.</p><p>We should publicly explain the reason for the change. Linus
has been saying in his &ldquo;World Domination 101&rdquo; speech that the
open-source culture needs to make a serious effort to take the
desktop and engage the corporate mainstream. Of course he's
right&mdash;and this re-labeling, as Linus agrees, is part of the
process. It says we're willing to work with and co-opt the market
for our own purposes, rather than remaining stuck in a marginal,
adversarial position.</p><p>Bruce Perens of Debian has volunteered to register &ldquo;open
source&rdquo; as a trademark and hold it in trust through Software in
the Public Interest. Richard Stallman has agreed to use the term,
provided he can be convinced that the new &ldquo;Open Source&rdquo; version
of the Debian Free Software Guidelines won't weaken them.</p><p>Over the next several months I'm going to be seriously
pitching the open-source concept to corporate America. I'm going to
be talking about the three business models I see for making money
from open sources:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The Cygnus/Red Hat/BSDI model: give away source,
sell service and support.</p></li><li><p>The Netscape model: use open-source software as a
loss leader and market positioner for commercial software.</p></li><li><p>The hardware-store model: outsource development of
the device drivers and interface tools for your widget to a bazaar
effort centered on your web site and led (but not monopolized) by
in-house programmers.</p></li></ol></div><p>I'm also going to be invoking the idea of &ldquo;peer review&rdquo; a
lot. Open-source software is peer-reviewed software, and thus more
reliable and respectable than that icky closed stuff.</p><p>In the near future, I think our best tactic is to go after
companies that fit the &ldquo;hardware-store&rdquo; model. For those outfits,
software development is strictly a cost rather than a profit center
or part of their corporate identity. If we can show them a way to
get much better software and better market position for minimum
effort, they'll have every reason to go for it.</p><p>A couple of easy wins in that arena will help Netscape and
other early pioneers feel less lonely and maybe even convince Wall
Street that it's seeing a trend. This will position us to go after
the big guys&mdash;Sun, SGI, Apple and Novell.</p><p>Every CEO and CTO I talk with is going to hear the same
thing. First, I'll ask if they have any strategic problem bigger
than &ldquo;Microsoft is going to crush me within five years.&rdquo; Then
I'll point out that nobody has ever beaten Bill Gates playing by
Bill Gates' rules. Then I'll tell them, &ldquo;The only way to survive
is to change the rules&mdash;and I'm here to show you how.&rdquo;</p><p>I hope everybody reading this will help. You are the people
who got open-source software this far; I'm just your tribune, a
sort of accidental ambassador to the suits. Frankly, I'd rather be
hacking; however, this is a job that needs doing that I'm fairly
well equipped for, so I won't shirk it. If you want to help, and
you work for a company you think might be a good target, here are
some things you can do:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Point your boss to
http://www.earthspace.net/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar and ask
him to do the same with his boss. Hey, it's worked so far!</p></li><li><p>If you can get the ear of your Chief Executive
Officer or Chief Technology Officer, e-mail and tell me. Then work
with me to get me in the door, so I can make the open-source pitch
for us.</p></li><li><p>If you work for the trade press, talk to me. The
more positive publicity we get, the better chance we have of
creating a positive climate of opinion that will make it easy for
CEOs to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</p></li></ol></div><p>I don't want to be the only ambassador, but the ambassadors
at least all have to be telling the same story. Once the effort
starts taking clearer shape, there will be a mailing list and a web
page and other resources aimed at helping open-source advocates
reach out to corporate America during this critical time.</p><p>We techies have been trying to win for Linux/Unix and open
standards/open source by quiet pressure from below for twenty
years, and for the most part it hasn't worked. Now, after Netscape,
we've got another chance&mdash;to break in from above. Let's do it
together!</p></div></div>
