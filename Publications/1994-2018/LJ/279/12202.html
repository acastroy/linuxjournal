Mistral Solutions' 820 Nano SOM</h2></div></div><p>
One of the smallest System on a Module (SOM) solutions currently available in
the market&mdash;measuring a mere 51mm x 26mm&mdash;is Mistral Solutions' 820
Nano SOM. The company predicts that
its new 820 Nano SOM solution is &ldquo;destined to be a preferred SoM in the
industry&rdquo;. The 820 Nano SOM is Mistral's latest small-form-factor,
high-performance SOM and is based on the powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 820
processor, which enjoys an ecosystem of technology providers using the latter
company's solutions. The 820 Nano SOM supports latest platform features like
Type-C functionality, 4K Encode/Decode and integrated 9-axis MEMS on a very
small footprint, making it ideal for development of wearable headset computers,
AR/VR glasses, drones, high-end cameras, media gateways, assistive devices and
other smart gadgets needing a significant processing power on a small package
footprint. Application development on the 820 Nano SOM is facilitated on
Android Nougat and embedded Linux using a feature-rich carrier board that
enables quick prototyping. Mistral further offers optional adaptor boards, such
as LCD, camera, sensors and battery charger for increased ease of development
around the 820 Nano SOM.

Applied Expert Systems, Inc.'s CleverView for TCP/IP on Linux</h2></div></div><p>
The contemporary data center is typified by an ever-increasing amount of traffic
occurring between servers, observes Applied Expert Systems, Inc. (AES), sagely.
Fulfilling the logical need to facilitate improved server-to-server
communications, AES created CleverView for TCP/IP on Linux, now at v2.7.
CleverView provides IT staff access to current and historical server
performance and availability details from not only their browser desktops but
also their mobile phones via the CLEVER Mobile for Linux app. This version 2.7
features enhancements to DockerView, namely container details including
resource utilization and process information, with the ability to drill down
into specific containers, and image details, including repository and image ID
with historical details. Finally, new options to the Enhanced Dashboard include
the ability to download a graph image, manipulate graph formats, display raw
data and a zoom feature with one-click navigation to view Alert Details from
the Alerts Summary graph.

Celtra's AdCreator Platform</h2></div></div><p>
Mobile advertising campaigns today are often hampered by broken, non-viewable
ads with a poor UX experience. An important open-source initiative aimed at
solving this problem and making the web better for all is the AMP Project,
which enables the creation of websites and ads that are consistently fast,
beautiful and high-performing across devices and distribution platforms. Now,
Celtra AdCreator, a SaaS creative management platform for digital advertising,
integrates support for the creation of AMP Ads, a new standard for making ads
faster, lighter and more secure. Celtra foresees a transformative power in this
new product, because AMP helps pave the way for better creative, a significantly
improved customer experience and higher mobile ad engagement rates and
resulting ROI. Celtra AdCreator overcomes the barriers of cost of data and slow
network speed that make it difficult to engage with viewers meaningfully.

Rogue Wave Software's Zend Studio</h2></div></div><p>
The quick pitch for Rogue Wave Software's Zend Studio, recently updated to
version 13.6, is &ldquo;the PHP IDE for smarter development&rdquo;. Zend Studio
13.6, says Rogue Wave, offers 3X faster performance in indexing, validation
and searching of PHP code, and it allows users to code faster, debug more easily and
leverage the massive performance gains in PHP 7. It is the next-generation PHP
IDE designed to create high-quality PHP apps while boosting developer
productivity. The platform automatically scales according to the DPI settings
of the underlying operating system and supports HiDPI monitors. The main focus
in this new release is the support for PHP 7.1, which contains useful language
improvements like nullable types, void return type and catching multiple
exception types. Additional feature improvements relate to Composer and
JavaScript tooling, and Zend Studio 13.6 takes advantage of the tern.js
intellisense engine, providing intellisense for a long list of JavaScript
frameworks, namely AngularJS, Closure, CordovaJS, Dojo, ExtJS, jQuery and
Node.js. Finally, the release comes with the latest and greatest release of the
Eclipse Platform, Neon.3, which brings with it its own slew of improvements.

Pydio</h2></div></div><p>
Pydio describes itself as the world's largest open-source file sharing and
synchronization project for the enterprise, and the newly announced Pydio 8
boasts a new user experience that the company says extends the platform's lead
in design and simplicity, oversight, security and control. Pydio 8 adds
EasyTransfer, a new, intuitive drag-and-drop web interface for organizations in
need of an easy-to-use sharing tool. Meanwhile, the aforementioned full UX
redesign, based on Google's Material Design principles, builds on Pydio's
already smooth and efficient design and simplifies the ability to white-label
Pydio. The new Share Tracking Tool rounds out the new feature set, providing
end users with the ability to send a single link to many different people and
track exactly who accessed it. Pydio can be deployed on-premises or in a private
cloud.

Gabriel Ford, Sadie Ford and Melissa Ford's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hello,
Scratch!</em></span> (Manning Publications)</h2></div></div><p>
In the new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hello, Scratch</em></span>!, parents and kids work together to learn
programming skills, but not in just any old way. They create new versions of
old retro-style arcade games with the Scratch open-source visual programming
language from the MIT Media Lab. Author Melissa Ford teamed up her two
children, Sadie and Gabriel, to write <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hello, Scratch!</em></span>,
and the intergenerational
trio begins by introducing the basic Scratch workspace, art editor and the
most common computer science concepts used in the projects, along with
interesting exercises centered on the games. The subsequent game chapters are
broken into two manageable parts with the initial, shorter section focused on
background and prep, and the second, longer section focused on coding. The
authors also explain how to make game art, including backgrounds and sprites
(the game pieces) in a pixel art style directly in the Scratch editor. Upon
finishing the book, readers will have the skills to create their own games and
understand the basics of computer programming and game design.

PSSC Labs' Eco Blade 1U</h2></div></div><p>
Arguably &ldquo;the greenest blade server on the market&rdquo;, PSSC Labs' new Eco
Blade 1U rack server offers power and performance with energy savings of up to
46% over competing servers, says the company. Engineered specifically for
high-performance, high-density computing environments, the Eco Blade is a
unique server platform that simultaneously increases compute density while
decreasing power use. The solution offers two complete and independent servers
contained in 1U of rack space. Each independent server supports up to 64 Intel
Xeon processor cores and 1.0TB of enterprise memory for a total of up to 128
Cores and 2TB of memory per 1U. A unique design feature&mdash;the lack of a shared
power supply or backplane&mdash;provides for the bulk of Eco Blade's power
savings and thus lower long-term TCO. PSSC Labs calls on the IT industry to
contribute its share to reducing its environmental footprint. The Eco Blade
enables organizations to obtain the performance needed to fuel cutting-edge
research and groundbreaking enterprises while significantly reducing the power
used and, thanks to the 55% recyclable material content, waste generated via
the data center. The Eco Blade 1U server is certified compatible with Red Hat
CentOS, Ubuntu and Microsoft operating systems.
