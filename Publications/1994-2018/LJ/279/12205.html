<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #279, July 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Filesystem inodes have version numbers that are incremented, well,
pretty much any time the filesystem thinks it would be useful.
There's not really any standard. Some do it when the inode metadata
changes; others also do it when the file data changes as well.
Whatever the case, updating the inode version number takes a finite
amount of time, which can add up to big delays for certain disk
operations.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jeff Layton</b></span> saw a way to reduce the number of version number updates
by incrementing the version number only when some other piece of code
actually queried the filesystem for that information. After all, the
actual version number was irrelevant&mdash;the calling code didn't care if
the number changed by 10, 15 or just 1. All that mattered was that
the version was different from the last time it checked.
</p><p>
He posted a patch, and <span   class="bold"><b>Christoph Hellwig</b></span> asked for some performance
numbers. Jeff said that in general, the performance advantage would
depend on the workload, but on his tests, he showed a twofold speed
improvement.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bruce Fields</b></span> loved Jeff's idea and tried to write some standard
requirements that might work across all filesystems. The version
should be a 64-bit number, which should be big enough to cover all
needs. It should apply to directories and not just plain files. It
should work across system reboots. And, the version number should
increment whenever any relevant inode data has changed between two
queries from outside code.
</p><p>
It's not the easiest set of requirements to meet, especially working
across system reboots. A crash can occur at any instant of kernel
execution. Making sure the system comes back up in a proper state can
require some finagling. What if the system went down after the version
number increased, but before the relevant data had been written to the
drive?
</p><p>
But, it's not as though this would be a new problem for filesystems,
<span   class="bold"><b>NFS</b></span> being a perennial case. Trying to have
filesystems perform truly
atomic operations is tough. At one point Jeff said, &ldquo;We may end up
having to settle for something less (and doing our best to warn users
of that possibility).&rdquo; And as <span   class="bold"><b>Dave
Chinner</b></span> said:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The big question is
how do we know there was a crash? The only thing a journaling
filesystem knows at mount time is whether it is clean or requires
recovery. Filesystems can require recovery for many reasons that don't
involve a crash (e.g. root fs is never unmounted cleanly, so always
requires recovery). Further, some filesystems may not even know there
was a crash at mount time because their architecture always leaves a
consistent filesystem on disk.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The discussion continued for a bit. Ultimately, it's probably not the
job of this particular feature to fix systemic problems that exist for
all filesystems. But if Jeff's patch makes atomicity even more
difficult to implement, that may have to be balanced against the
magnitude of the speed improvement it offers. That kind of question
usually would work its way up to <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> to arbitrate, but only
after making its way through the various security and stability
concerns that might crop up along the way.
</p><p>
Now that companies are building massive, world-shaking data centers in
order to perform tasks of utter complexity in mere fractions of a
second, console debugging output speed has become a thing. <span   class="bold"><b>Calvin
Owens</b></span> from <span   class="bold"><b>Facebook</b></span> posted a patch to let users configure exactly how
much output to send to the console, on a console-by-console basis.
This way the slow consoles could receive less output, and the faster
consoles could receive more.
</p><p>
There were a few little nits to pick, such as which existing kernel
parameters should be honored or ignored, and which console messages
were too important to let the user configure away. But there were no
major objections, and the feature seems sure to go into the official
tree some time in the near future.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>uaccess.h</b></span> code provides functions for transferring lots of data
between kernel and user space. The problem is that the various
architectures have been rolling their own for years, with consequent
divergence of semantics and behaviors, not to mention lots of bugs
and difficulty preserving secure operations.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Al Viro</b></span> was in the process of clawing the code back from this state
into something that could be worked with. He'd already begun to
centralize the mess into an easily accessible location, and now he wanted
to make the semantics identical for all architectures. He did this by
replacing the existing set of calls with eight standard routines. The only
architectures he couldn't fix on his own were <span   class="bold"><b>metag</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>ia64</b></span>, which
had odd behaviors that required decisions from maintainers.
</p><p>
There was general agreement that Al was awesome, and the work really
needed to be done, but there were some implementation details that
some folks still wanted to hash out. For example, <span   class="bold"><b>Vineet Gupta</b></span> wanted
to inline some of the code to speed things up. But, Al felt that any
speed improvement was likely to be seen only on a small number of
architectures, and Linus Torvalds was even more fundamentally opposed.
He felt that there was not much to gain except in a few cases of
largely obscure and hidden functions.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, various folks tested Al's patch on various architectures
and reported overall success. In spite of this, Al's current patch
represents only one step along a larger path. The metag and ia64
maintainers still need to offer some assistance, and there are further
cleanups in the same area of code that Al wants to tackle. In fact,
Linus was all for tackling them right there in this patch, but Al
wanted to do things in order and get the earlier stuff right before
proceeding to the later.
</p><p>
This sort of patch is rarely controversial. Generally, everyone is
happy when semantics get cleaned up and the rate of bug production
slows. But since this type of patch tends to affect everyone, there
are often various stakeholders with issues to address, like unexpected
slowdowns.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Sleep Fast, Sleep Hard</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #279, July 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The older I get, the more I can truly appreciate a good nap. No really,
there's just something about it&mdash;taking a nap mid-afternoon is an amazing
experience. Unfortunately, with a busy work schedule, I find it difficult
to take a nap. It's not that I can't afford the 20-minute break; it's
just that I can't ever get to sleep&mdash;that is, until I discovered Pzizz.
</p><p>
Pzizz is an Android app that generates a custom &ldquo;nap narrative&rdquo;
that
helps ease you off to dreamland and wakes you up when it's over. I was
very skeptical about how restful a 20-minute forced nap could be, and
at first, I doubted I'd fall asleep at all. Thankfully, I was very wrong.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12205androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="12205androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Pzizz (which my spell check really wants to change to &ldquo;pizza&rdquo;) generates an
eerie, 3D-sound soundtrack, and it provides verbal prompting that helps lull
you off to sleep. And, it works. It works well. The music is hard to describe. There
are chimes, strings and ocean sounds, and they all blend into a
&ldquo;moving&rdquo; 3D
auditory experience that knocks me right out. I'm often worried the eerie
sounds will give me nightmares, but quite the opposite seems to happen. I
always fall asleep, and I always feel rested when the app wakes me up
20 minutes later. (The amount time can be adjusted to suit your nap preferences.)
</p><p>
So far, I've used Pzizz only for naps, but there's also a module to aid with
sleeping through the night. I can't wear earphones or earbuds that long,
so I've never tried it overnight. I think if I lived alone, I might try
connecting my phone to speakers and play Pzizz out loud. If you have
a bed mate, it's the sort of thing you'd have to discuss in advance,
and I don't think my wife would be keen on the eerie-sounding music and
British man's voice all night!
</p><p>
The Pzizz app is free in the Google Play Store, and I can't recommend
it enough. In fact, for doing exactly what it claims to do while never
trying to push an expensive &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo;, Pzizz gets this month's
Editors' Choice award. Give it a try this afternoon&mdash;unless you're a
bus driver, in which case, wait until after work to give it a try.

<h2 class="title">pfSense: Not Linux, Not Bad</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #279, July 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Through the years, I've used all sorts of router and firewall solutions at
home and at work. For home networks, I usually recommend something like
DD-WRT, OpenWRT or Tomato on an off-the-shelf router. For business,
my recommendations typically are something like a Ubiquiti router or a
router/firewall solution like Untangled or ClearOS. A few years ago,
however, a coworker suggested I try pfSense instead of a Linux-based
solution. I was hesitant, but I have to admit, pfSense with its BSD core
is a rock-solid performer that I've used over and over at multiple sites.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12205fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="12205fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
It's not that pfSense is better than a Linux solution, but rather, it
feels more focused. It seems like many of the firewall/router solutions
out there try too hard to be everything for your network. pfSense offers
services like DNS, DHCP, SNMP and so on, but out of the box, it just routes
traffic and does it very well. Another thing that makes pfSense worth
checking out is that there's no &ldquo;premium&rdquo; version of it. What you download
is the full, complete pfSense product. The only thing you can pay for is
support. That model has been around for a long time in the Open Source
world, but lately it's been outmoded by the &ldquo;freemium&rdquo;-type offerings.
</p><p>
If you're looking for a firewall/router/NAT solution for your network,
and you're not afraid to use a non-Linux product, I can't recommend
pfSense enough. It's fast, rock-solid, and it has just enough network-related
addons available to make it a viable option for small to medium-sized
networks. Plus, it's completely free, so you can test it out without
any financial commitment! Check it out today at <a href="http://www.pfsense.org" target="_self">www.pfsense.org</a>.

<h2 class="title">Hugin Those Photos into a Huge One!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #279, July 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Most phones have a panoramic photo mode that allows you to take a wide
shot by moving the phone as it records. Unfortunately, it's not always
convenient to do so. Thanks to digital photos being fast and cheap,
I usually take a bunch of snapshots when I'm trying to get a good
shot. Occasionally, it would be nice to stitch those photos together
into something bigger, but actually doing so is harder than it seems. Different
angles combined with perspective shifts means a lowly human with a photo
editor has almost no chance of stitching together photos into something
believable.
</p><p>
Hugin is an open-source tool available at <a href="http://hugin.sf.net" target="_self">hugin.sf.net</a>
that takes
photos and mathematically computes the matching bits in order to stitch
together a panoramic shot. It seems like a simple enough task, but if
you've ever tried to accomplish something like that manually, you'll
truly appreciate Hugin. It's free, it's powerful, and I'm happy to say
that it's easy to use as well. I just took two photos out my office window,
and I was able to stitch them together with Hugin in about 20 seconds.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12205huginf1.large.jpg"><img src="12205huginf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Hugin also supports things like 360-degree compilations, so if you're
at all interested in photography, be sure to add Hugin to your list of
software packages. It's amazing!

One of the problems with being a nerd is that you always seem to want
the latest and greatest items. This year alone, I've struggled to find
a Nintendo Classic, a Nintendo Switch and a PlayStation 4 Farpoint VR
bundle. Not only are all the stores out of stock, but places like Amazon
aren't even taking back orders. Unless you're willing to be price-gouged
on eBay, the only option is to wait. Unfortunately, thousands
of other people are out there waiting too, so when something comes back into
stock, it immediately sells out.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12205nowf1.large.jpg"><img src="12205nowf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
If you don't have the time to check Amazon all day waiting for
your must-have product to be restocked, I urge you to check out
<a href="http://www.nowinstock.net" target="_self">www.nowinstock.net</a>. It's a site that will notify you when a product
is available, which alleviates the need for constantly checking. (Be sure
to use .net on that URL, I think the .com is a fake site.)
</p><p>
I ended up buying the Farpoint Bundle on eBay, because I'm so into
virtual reality that I didn't want to wait. But if you're a bit more
patient than I am, NowInStock might be a perfect tool.

<h2 class="title">Visualizing Molecules with Python</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #279, July 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I've looked at several open-source packages for computational chemistry in
the past, but in this article, I cover a package written in
Python called PyMOL (<a href="https://www.pymol.org" target="_self">https://www.pymol.org</a>).
</p><p>
PyMOL is
a very powerful program, used for visualizing and analyzing chemical
structures. Although the main project is an open-source one,
a commercial version is available that provides support for those who
need it. 
</p><p>
There are several installation options, but I 
actually suggest that you don't install it directly from the 
available downloads. You first will need to install a rather large number
of dependencies, which may lead you to dependency hell. So, if
the package manager for your particular distribution includes a package
for PyMOL, it probably will be much easier to use it, especially when
you are just learning how to use PyMOL. 
</p><p>
As I've mentioned and is obvious
from the name, PyMOL is written in Python, and it also uses 3D libraries to
handle the actual image rendering. PyMOL also is written with
a plugin architecture, which means you can expand PyMOL's feature set 
to handle new analysis workflows.
</p><p>
When you first start PyMOL, two windows will open (Figure 1).
The first is a console window where you will
be able to interact with PyMOL programmatically. The second window is
the actual viewer for the results of the visualization and analysis of
your chemistry problem. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12205pymolf1.large.jpg"><img src="12205pymolf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. When you first start up PyMOL, you get both a console window and
a viewer window.
</p></div></div><p>
The most basic usage is as a regular
viewer of chemical structures. In order to do that, click the
File&rarr;Open menu item to pop up a dialog window where you can select
the file to open (Figure 2). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12205pymolf2.large.jpg"><img src="12205pymolf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Opening a PDB file renders the molecule within the viewer window.
</p></div></div><p>
PyMOL can handle several dozen different
file formats. If you don't have any input files of your own yet, you
can get PDB files from the RCSB Protein Data Bank in order to explore 
PyMOL and see what you can do with it (<a href="http://www.pdb.org" target="_self">www.pdb.org</a>).
</p><p>
When it opens, you will get the
default view of the molecule as a stick figure. Within the viewer window,
there are three panes. The left-hand pane contains the actual rendered
image. On the right-hand side, there are two smaller panes. The bottom
half has a description of mouse actions you can use to manipulate
the molecule in the viewer. You can rotate the image, zoom in and out,
and control clipping and selection of the objects rendered within the
viewing pane. The top half is the object control panel. It contains a
list of all of the objects that are being worked with in the current
session. 
</p><p>
Each object in the list has a series of buttons that can apply
functions to that object. There is one special entry at the top of the
list that affects all of the objects together. The first button, labeled
&ldquo;A&rdquo;, is a set of actions you can apply to selected objects. These
actions include things like using presets for viewing options or
even initiating calculations (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12205pymolf3.large.jpg"><img src="12205pymolf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. A number of presets are available to make visualization easy.
</p></div></div><p>
You can alter several other
view options of the display through the action menu. The &ldquo;S&rdquo;
and &ldquo;H&rdquo;
buttons provide menus of which elements to show and which elements to
hide. The &ldquo;L&rdquo; button lets you set what gets labeled within
the viewer, and the &ldquo;C&rdquo; button lets you play with how colors
are used within the rendering. 
</p><p>
You also have the option of changing the
viewing elements directly within the viewing pane by right-clicking in
the viewer. When you do, you get a drop-down menu that allows you to
change the zoom, the orientation and what objects are visible, among
many other options. 
</p><p>
With so many settings to change, you may
find yourself in a situation where you can't see the relevant objects
anymore, or you may not be able to undo the changes you have
made effectively. In those situations, you can right-click the viewer and select
the Reset entry to start over from the beginning.
</p><p>
For more complex interactions, a number of wizards are available from the Wizards menu item to help you coordinate these types of
interactions. For example, you could work with density maps by clicking
the Density option (Figure 4). This gives you a set of tools within
the right-hand pane where you can change settings around the density
mapping
functionality.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12205pymolf4.large.jpg"><img src="12205pymolf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. There are wizards to help you with more complex tasks, such as
working with density maps.
</p></div></div><p>
There is also a suite of plugins, which can add
extra features to PyMOL. Go to Plugin&rarr;Plugin Manager
for a new window where you can work with those plugins (Figure 5).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12205pymolf5.large.jpg"><img src="12205pymolf5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The plugin manager allows you install, remove and configure your
PyMOL plugins.
</p></div></div><p>
Clicking the &ldquo;Install New Plugin&rdquo; tab provides a few options of
how to install your new plugin. The first option allows you to install
directly from a file stored on your local filesystem. The second option
is to install a plugin from the PyMOL Wiki, and you can enter a URL pointing
to a plugin described on one of the Wiki pages. The third option is
to select and install a plugin from one of the available repositories
of plugins. 
</p><p>
When you select one of the repositories from the list,
the available plugin list will be populated, and you simply can select
the plugin you need from that list. 
</p><p>
Although you can write your own
full-fledged plugins, you also can add your own customized functionality
much more easily by using scripts. PyMOL includes a command language
of its own that you can use directly within the console window. These
include simple commands, like loading files or saving images, and more
complex commands, such as doing fits between two molecules. 
</p><p>
Along with these
built-in commands, you also have access to a full Python interpreter
underneath the hood. This means you can write Python scripts that
work with these commands and the objects within your PyMOL session to do
even more complex tasks. 
</p><p>
Once you have your task figured out, you can
save your work within a script file that you can reload later and
apply within a different session. 
</p><p>
The PyMOL Wiki also hosts a script
library, and it's a good place to look before you start down the
road of creating your own script, as someone else may have
run into the same issue and may have found
a solution you can use. If nothing else, you may be able to find a
script that could serve as a starting point for your own particular problem.
</p><p>
When you're are done working with PyMOL, there are many different ways to
end the session. If there is work you are likely to pick up
again and continue with, click File&rarr;Save
Session to save all of the work you just did, including all
of the transitions applied to the view. If the changes you made were
actually structural, rather than just superficial changes to the way
the molecule looked, you can save those structural changes by selecting
File&rarr;Save Molecule. This allows you to write out
the new molecule to a chemical file format, such as a PDB file. 
</p><p>
If
you need output for publications or presentations, a
few different options are available. Clicking File&rarr;Save
Image As allows you to select from saving a regular image file in PNG
format or writing out data in a POVRay or VRML 3D file format. If you
are doing a fancier presentation, you even can export a movie of your
molecule by clicking File&rarr;Save Movie As. This lets
you generate an MPEG movie file that can be used either on a web-based
journal or within a slide deck for a presentation.
