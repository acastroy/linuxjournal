Android isn't enough. We need more. And not just of Linux.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c1580.0x21b9300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Linux has long since proven it's possible for one operating system to work for
everyone&mdash;also that there's an approach to development that opens and frees code so
everyone can use it, improve it and assure its freedoms spread to everyone doing the
same.
</p><p>
This has been great for computing at all scales. But, it hasn't been great for
everybody, yet, because not everybody has access to hardware or software, but we can
still help them out, our way.
</p><p>
What I'm suggesting here is that we conceive and develop new approaches to bringing
the benefits of free and open-source computing, software and methods to everybody.
</p><p>
Let's start with the hardest cases: refugees' need for identification methods that
don't depend on some country's or government's central system that either doesn't
exist or can be used to screw or kill them. What's the best approach to that?
</p><p>
As of this writing (late May 2017), the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) says there are now 65.3
million forcibly displaced people in the world. Among those are 21.3 million refugees,
of which more than half are under the age of 18. (See the UNHCR's data portal for
particulars: <a href="http://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations" target="_self">data2.unhcr.org/en/situations</a>.)
</p><p>
According to Unicef, one in three children under five years old in the world &ldquo;does not
officially exist&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.unicef.org/media/media_71508.html" target="_self">https://www.unicef.org/media/media_71508.html</a>).
</p><p>
There are many digital identity needs among these populations&mdash;for example, the need
to connect with displaced and separated others. The need to disclose&mdash;or not
disclose&mdash;religion or country of origin. The need to declare professional
credentials or proof of expertise (such as ones that say convincingly that &ldquo;I am a
nurse&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I am a certified accountant&rdquo;). The need to disclose helpful medical
information selectively, such as blood type for transfusions. The need to open a bank
account, or just to access funds. The list goes on, and it's a long one.
</p><p>
As human beings we are inherently distributed. All of us are single and separate
entities with sovereign souls, by design, no matter what country we were born in or
what tribe(s) we belong to. We look and sound different so we can tell each other
apart, and so we know a few other humans deeply. Even identical twins, with identical
DNA, have very different and distinctive souls and personalities, given to making very
different choices in life&mdash;the transgender actress Laverne Cox
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laverne_Cox" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laverne_Cox</a>), for example, has an
identical twin brother who is still happily male.
</p><p>
It is impossible to respect anything in the last paragraph fully inside a centralized
identity system. All centralized identity systems exist for the convenience of
institutions first and individuals second, third, or even not at all. Often it can
greatly benefit an individual to have access to institutional records when they are
needed. In the developed world, this is a civic and commercial grace. For those
outside that world, especially refugees, those same systems may not exist or can
present a great danger if they do. It all depends. That's why control of dependencies
should be in the hands of the individuals themselves or trusted others. How can we
make that work?
</p><p>
It helps that the Internet's base protocol, TCP/IP, gives us a distributed digital
world where every node is inherently independent and able to pass data back and forth
with every other node. This gives every individual what Archimedes called
&ldquo;a place to
stand&rdquo; where he could move the world, provided he had a lever long enough. Linux is
one of those levers. We can invent and deploy many others as well. There are no limit
on this.
</p><p>
It hurts that we chose client-server (which might as well be called slave-master) as
the defaulted way to deploy the World Wide Web in the first place, and still today.
Brian Behlendorf (<a href="http://brian.behlendorf.com" target="_self">brian.behlendorf.com</a>), of the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger
project (<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org" target="_self">https://www.hyperledger.org</a>), called client-server
&ldquo;the original sin&rdquo; of the web when he spoke to Quartz's The Next Billion conference
last October (<a href="https://qz.com/on/the-next-billion" target="_self">https://qz.com/on/the-next-billion</a>). Hyperledger is a
global &ldquo;open-source collaborative effort created to
advance cross-industry blockchain technologies&rdquo;. It also &ldquo;incubates and promotes a
range of business blockchain technologies, including distributed ledger frameworks,
smart contract engines, client libraries, graphical interfaces, utility libraries and
sample applications&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Among Hyperledger's projects and frameworks (<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects" target="_self">https://www.hyperledger.org/projects</a>) is
one called Indy
(<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2017/05/02/hyperledger-welcomes-project-indy" target="_self">https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2017/05/02/hyperledger-welcomes-project-indy</a>) that uses what it calls
a universal trust framework to provide &ldquo;accessible provenance for trust
transactions&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2017/01/a_universal_trust_framework.shtml" target="_self">www.windley.com/archives/2017/01/a_universal_trust_framework.shtml</a>).
More specifically, it supports &ldquo;user-controlled exchange of verifiable claims
(<a href="http://www.w3.org/2017/vc" target="_self">www.w3.org/2017/vc</a>) about an
identifier&rdquo; and &ldquo;has a rock-solid revocation model for cases where those claims are no
longer true&rdquo;, adding &ldquo;Verifiable claims are a key component of Indy's ability to
serve as a universal platform for exchanging trustworthy claims about
identifiers.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Boring stuff, I know. Less boring is this:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Indy is all about giving identity owners independent control of their personal data
and relationships. Indy is built so that the owner of the identity is structurally
part of transactions made about that identity. Pairwise identifiers not only prevent
correlation, but they stop third parties from transacting without the identity owner
taking part since the identity owner is the only place pairwise identifiers can be
correlated.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12201f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Indy gives identity owners independent control of their personal data and
relationships.
</p></div></div><p>
Indy is based on open standards so that it can interoperate with other distributed
ledgers. These start, of course, with public-key cryptography standards. Other
important standards cover things like the format of the identifiers, what they point
to and how agents exchange verifiable claims.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
While all that sounds very First World-ish, it also was designed with refugees in
mind. Phil Windley, chair and president of the nonprofit
Sovrin Foundation (<a href="https://www.sovrin.org" target="_self">https://www.sovrin.org</a>), which
created Indy, addresses the issue here
(<a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2016/04/self-sovereign_identity_and_legal_identity.shtml" target="_self">www.windley.com/archives/2016/04/self-sovereign_identity_and_legal_identity.shtml</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Descartes didn't say &ldquo;I have a birth certificate, therefore, I am.&rdquo; We are, obviously,
more than a legal identity. Nevertheless, the civil registration has been with us for
almost four centuries and most of us cannot conceive of any basis for trusted identity
independent of civil registration.
</p><p>
And yet, presently, 1.8 billion people are without this basic form of identity. As a
result, they have difficulty getting basic government services. Most of these people
are refugees displaced by war or territorial disputes, victims of famine or ethnic
cleansing, outcasts from society, or victims of unscrupulous employers, smugglers, or
organized crime. People who want to help them have difficulty because without legal
identity they are illegible to state apparatus.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Then he advances a solution:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We are at a point in the development of identity that it is possible to develop and
deploy technologies that allow individuals to create a self-sovereign basis for their
identity independent from civil registration.
</p><p>
Such systems allow us to tease apart the purposes of the birth certificate by
recognizing a self-sovereign identity independent of the proof of citizenship. This
doesn't, by itself, solve the problem of providing legal identity since the
self-sovereign identity is self-asserted. But it does provide a foundation upon which
a legal identity could be built: specifically it is an identifier that a person can
prove they control.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Sovrin/Indy is one of those. Four other efforts I know well in the space are Customer
Commons (<a href="http://customercommons.org/terms" target="_self">customercommons.org/terms</a>), which will have terms 
that
refugees&mdash;or anybody&mdash;can proffer, People
Centered Internet (<a href="https://peoplecentered.net" target="_self">https://peoplecentered.net</a>), the Internet Bar Association
(<a href="https://www.internetbar.org" target="_self">https://www.internetbar.org</a>) and iRespond (<a href="http://irespond.org" target="_self">irespond.org</a>). For example, Peter
Simpson of iRespond tells me &ldquo;We are combining our years of non-profit work in
humanitarian identity using biometrics that work in resource-poor and remote areas of
the world and linking that 'flesh to digital' with Sovrin's
permission-based distributed ledger technology.&rdquo;
</p><p>
To sum this up, I see two ways we (<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> readers) can help solve the refugee
crisis. One is by making it as easy as possible for individual refugees to enjoy
the benefits of both self-sovereign and administrative identities, while minimizing
the risks. The other is to make clear how valuable many refugees are to the countries
that might welcome them.
</p><p>
Please think about what you can do to join in any of the many efforts afoot to bring
to everybody the full benefits of Linux and Linux-modeled approaches to solving
problems and maximizing the variety of solutions.
</p><p>
Every human being has value to others as well as to themselves. We are designed that
way too. Let's make the most of that.
