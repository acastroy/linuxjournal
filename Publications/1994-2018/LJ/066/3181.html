    How a bank in Argentina is using Linux for testing database
    and web applications.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101f580.0x1117348"></a></h2></div></div><p>Bisel Bank was born around 1994 as a
merging of many small banks. It is now one of the largest banks of
Argentina with more than 160 branch offices (and plans to open many
more) running in-house software, which will be replaced after the
year 2000 with a commercial offering.
</p><p>The central office runs on a Sun Enterprise 5500 server
running Solaris 2.6 (with a similar one as a backup server), and
all data is stored in an Informix Online 7 DSA database. The
applications, written in JAM and ESQL/C, work quite well.</p><p>The branch offices use SCO UNIX and a mixture of Progress,
ESQL/C and JAM/Informix applications. It all started when we had to
consolidate about eight different systems from different banks. The
JAM/Informix and Progress applications running on UNIX boxes won
the battle against the other contenders, including some AS/400
hardware and software.</p><p>The software is developed and maintained by a group of
programmers who continuously have to modify running programs or
make new ones from scratch. We have to manage much &ldquo;traffic&rdquo; to
and from the main server. To do this, we implemented a version
control system for the programs using RCS (revision control
system), and a system to send them to the main computer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101f580.0x1117558"></a>How This Works</h2></div></div><p>After the requirement for a new program or change in an
existing one has been met and the new or changed program is
finished, the program passes through a set of testing and
authorization stages before it moves into the production
environment.</p><p>When all is okay, the programs are sent to the central office
or to an automatic distribution system (as required), which sends
the modifications to all the branch offices overnight. This system
was implemented using <span   class="bold"><b>rsync</b></span> (on a
Solaris server), so the amount of data transferred over the network
is kept to a minimum.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101f580.0x1117710"></a>Linux Entrance</h2></div></div><p>Finally, Linux makes its triumphant entrance. It all began
when I came to this bank as a formal employee in November 1997.
Being a Linux user since kernel 0.99, I believed that Linux
deserved its place in this bank scenario.</p><p>I decided to install a Linux server to use as a test box.
First, I used this equipment to test several software packages,
then when I was satisfied, I moved the software to the Solaris
environment. SCO was out of the question for testing purposes,
because it was the old SCO 3.2.4.2, which makes it difficult to
port software for it.</p><p>I began using the Linux box to test products such as Samba,
rdist, rsync, Apache Web Server, PHP/FI, PHP3, MSql, MySQL, Solid
Server, Solid Web Engine, VNC, Squid and even Informix SE for
Linux. Much of this software is being used now at the bank on
either the Solaris, SCO or Linux platforms or a combination of
them.</p><p>I implemented various projects, such as designing and
implementing networks using Samba; RCS for source code; an Intranet
for manuals, documentation and internal procedures; automatic
distribution of applications using rdist, which was soon replaced
with rsync to save transfer time; a couple of backup procedures
over the network; and even some tests with Java and JDBC to access
database servers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101f580.0x1117920"></a>Real Linux Work</h2></div></div><p>One day, a new project came about: build an application to
use the Intranet to send programs to the production environment.
What I wanted was to have complete control over where a program is
at every moment.</p><p><a href="3181f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Program Management Entry Screen</b></span></a></p><p>First, the programmer writes a new program or a modification
to an existing one using RCS (with a front end designed to ease the
programmer's work) to keep control of the versions. Then he or she
must tell someone the program is finished, so someone else can have
a look at it and make the appropriate tests before passing it to
the production environment.</p><p>This is done by logging in to the &ldquo;Sistema de Pasaje de
Programas&rdquo; system and entering the name of the program. At this
point, the program is ready to receive an authorization to be sent
to the testing environment. Once the authorization is granted, it
can effectively be sent to the testing environment.</p><p>After all the necessary tests are passed successfully, the
program is ready to go to the production environment. This is done
by a similar process. In the first stage, the program is left
&ldquo;ok&rdquo; to be passed, so it requires another authorization, then the
final pass to the production environment.</p><p>All these authorizations and passages are recorded in a
database, so we can know exactly where one program is in every
moment, i.e., when it has been authorized or passed to which
environment.</p><p>All is done with a web-enabled application in which a record
is inserted into the database, so the person in charge of the
authorization finds it on a list on his screen when he checks
whether there is something to be authorized. Then, this record is
updated with the current user, date and time, so the person who
makes the actual pass finds it on his list. It's easier to actually
use than to explain in words. The application can also be sent to
another testing environment with large quantities of data to make
more extensive tests.</p><p><a href="3181f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2. Login
Screen</b></span></a></p><p>This system is hosted on a Slackware Linux server with 16MB
of RAM, 1GB of disk space and a 133MHz Pentium processor. It has an
Apache web server and a Solid database. It usually has an uptime of
60 or more days without any kind of problem. The HTML pages were
made using a PHP3 build as an Apache module. This system was
designed as a test for the Solid engine, which proves to be quite
good&mdash;I recommend it. Because of the release of Informix SE for
Linux and the use of Informix by our organization, I am
reengineering the whole system with Informix SE or Informix OnLine,
and it will be fully operational by the time you read this
article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101f580.0x1117e48"></a>Consideration</h2></div></div><p>One interesting consideration in this system is the stage at
which the program is actually passed to the test or production
environment. This is done with CGI scripts which execute various
commands directly related to our programming environment. The
system can be adapted to a totally new programming environment by
replacing only those CGI scripts&mdash;it is not JAM-dependent. It was
created with this independence in mind, because the bank will
change its system in the near future, so this independence
guarantees we can continue to use it with minor adjustments on our
new system.</p><p><a href="3181f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.
Program History Screen</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101f580.0x1118058"></a>Under the Hood</h2></div></div><p>The method I used to pass a program to a different machine,
which runs Solaris using a web application, is simply installing a
web server on the Solaris, then using a URL that references a CGI
script on that remote machine. This CGI script is responsible for
passing the program, issuing the necessary
<span   class="bold"><b>rcp</b></span> command and any commands
necessary to leave the program ready to be used.</p><p>As you can see, the actual work is done by CGI scripts and
all the HTML pages are used to glue the scripts in a nice-looking,
easy-to-use application which stores all the program &ldquo;flow&rdquo;
between equipment and stages in a database. I easily added report
pages to view the activities by day or to search by program
name.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101f580.0x1118210"></a>Current and New Projects</h2></div></div><p>In addition to porting all this to Informix, we are currently
developing an application for the Human Resources office to
retrieve information on employees. This is being done in a similar
way and will be hosted on this same Linux server.</p><p>Because of the robustness shown by this architecture, we'll
be making more and more web applications in the future, and Linux
will be there as our web server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101f580.0x1118370"></a>One Final Note</h2></div></div><p>I am quite impressed by PHP3&mdash;this product is incredibly
flexible and powerful and can handle complex applications without
problems. Its database support is getting better, supporting not
only the classic freeware and shareware databases such as mSQL,
MySQL and Postgres, or commercial databases such as Solid, but also
the big databases such as Informix, Oracle and Sybase.</p><p>Without any doubt, Linux has a wonderful business future and
is my favourite OS for Intel machines, outperforming Windows NT and
SCO UNIX. In my opinion, Linux and Solaris are the best operating
systems on the market at this time.</p><p>One important aspect to consider is the type of technical
support available for your OS and for any other product you
regularly use. On one occasion, I was stuck with a problem (it was
my fault) that forced the Linux server to go down. I received help
in 20 minutes from three technicians. Where did I get this kind of
excellent support? Of course, it was the Internet. I posted a
message, and in 20 minutes my problem was solved. I have not seen
this kind of fast response on any commercial product from any
company.</p></div></div>
