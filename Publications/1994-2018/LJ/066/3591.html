    An experiment and experience in using Linux in an embedded
    application.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1324580.0x141c818"></a></h2></div></div><p>We believe Linux is going to play a
significant role in embedded applications. It is compliant with
POSIX 1003.1 and supports the POSIX soft real-time extension.
Theoretically, it is capable of supporting a wide range of embedded
applications which require only soft real-time performance such as
Internet routing. Easy customization makes it even more attractive.
To investigate the possibilities of using Linux as a platform for
embedded systems, we conducted an experiment in which we ported the
kernel to a PowerPC-based board. The porting took a few weeks. Our
result is a Linux port, called
<span   class="bold"><b>elinux</b></span> here, based on the Linux
kernel 2.1.132 which was the latest version at the time we began
the experiment. <span   class="bold"><b>elinux</b></span> runs dozens
of commands and programs, including
<span   class="bold"><b>bash</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> on the console via a serial
port. Porting Linux is actually a very enjoyable experience.
Besides, all the work is based on open-source software exclusively.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1324580.0x141ca80"></a>Introduction</h2></div></div><p>Linux is portable. We have already seen many Linux ports on
various processors. However, few documents describe how to port
Linux. The information is scattered in various documents and source
code. Porting is not an easy job for any operating system. Even a
minor change in the kernel code to suit a particular piece of
hardware needs a considerable effort. Fortunately for Linux, all
major components of the kernel are already designed to be
architecture-independent. This makes the work relatively much
easier.</p><p>It is harder to port Linux to a board with a new processor
than with a processor Linux has already supported. In the latter
case, we can reuse board-independent code; for example, the code
for memory management. Only a relatively small portion of the
kernel code is board-dependent. When we considered implementing
elinux, we tried to avoid reinventing the wheel. We kept most of
the necessary changes limited to board-dependent parts. Our
experiment was done on a PowerPC-based board. Linux already has
ports for PowerPC-based machines such as Power Macintosh and a few
PowerPC-based embedded boards. However, due to diverse board
architectures, configurations and booting methods, modifications
are required when we consider a new board.</p><p>In our case, some changes in the kernel and a few small new
programs were created to support elinux. In the following article,
we emphasize our experience with the issues of most concern in our
work rather than implementation details. These include setting up
the cross-development platform, designing the booting sequence,
modifying the kernel, creating the executable image and root file
system image and debugging.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1324580.0x141cc38"></a>Experimental Hardware</h2></div></div><p>Our goal is not to port Linux to a particular kind of
hardware. Instead, we are interested in approaches to porting the
Linux kernel to potential embedded systems. Thus, it doesn't matter
what kind of board we choose as long as it presents a typical
situation. The board we actually used in our experiments is a
PowerPC-based board built on a PCI bus. It has a PowerPC 603e
processor, an MPC 106 as the memory controller and the PCI bridge,
32MB DRAM memory, a PC16552 DUART chip for two serial ports, a
memory-mapped real-time clock in non-volatile memory and a simple
but customized interrupt controller. It also has two flash memory
slots and an Intel 82558 LAN controller to provide three LAN
ports.</p><p>The board has its own bootstrap code in ROM. This code does
hardware initialization and also provides a simple native file
system and the TFTP support. Although we used these two services to
boot elinux, our approach can support booting completely from
ROM.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1324580.0x141cd98"></a>Cross-Development Platform</h2></div></div><p>Simply installing binaries from any Linux distribution does
not guarantee a working cross-development platform. Some people
experienced difficulties in setting up a complete cross-development
environment. Our experience shows that this is not only possible,
but also brings us a fair amount of convenience, as we can use some
of the most popular software packages. Our lessons are proper
distributions, proper configurations and recompiling.</p><p>Here are our actual steps in setting up the cross-development
platform for PowerPC on Pentium machines:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Install Red Hat 5.2 on a Dell OptiPlex Pentium II
400 MHz PC with 256MB RAM and 8GB SCSI hard disk.</p></li><li><p>Get the source code of the latest stable Linux
kernel, 2.0.36 when our work began.</p></li><li><p>Recompile the kernel from the kernel source to make
sure support for loopback devices, RAM disks and other necessary
items is included.</p></li><li><p>Use the newly recompiled image to boot the
development platform.</p></li></ul></div><p>After the base development system is ready, we install
cross-development support as follows:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>First, install the source code of the binary
utilities binutils-2.9.1.0.15 which includes cross-assembler,
cross-loader and other cross-utilities.</p></li><li><p>Recompile and install the cross-utilities for
PowerPC with Linux.</p></li><li><p>Install the source code of the compiler gcc
2.8.1.</p></li><li><p>Recompile and install for the
cross-compiler.</p></li></ul></div>

After this, the environment is ready to develop elinux on the
Pentium machine. As for the standard C library glibc, we don't need
it at this time. If we wanted to do general programming for elinux,
we could cross-compile the glibc. For convenience in testing small
programs, we actually used glibc binaries for PowerPC from the Red
Hat distribution.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1324580.0x141d580"></a>Design of the Booting Sequence</h2></div></div><p>Booting an operating system seems easy. You just power on the
system, and after a while, you'll see a prompt on the console which
indicates the system is running. If we look into the booting
internals, we get a more complicated view. Booting includes
hardware initialization and software startup, operations which
differ from board to board. Different booting code exists for each
kind of board in the Linux architecture-dependent source code
directory, that is, linux/arch/. For a new board, we usually have
to add a new booting sequence.</p><p>A typical embedded board has no floppy and no hard disk. Code
and data are initially put in ROM or can be downloaded through a
network connection. We have designed a general approach to booting
such a system from ROM.</p><p>Our approach is to divide the booting into two stages
supported by two separate loaders. One is called the image loader
<span   class="bold"><b>iloader</b></span>, and the other is the
Linux kernel loader <span   class="bold"><b>kloader</b></span>.
<span   class="bold"><b>iloader</b></span> is ROM-able. That is,
after the system is powered up, it starts, does necessary hardware
initialization, then moves the Linux kernel loader from ROM to the
proper location in RAM. <span   class="bold"><b>kloader</b></span>
starts running once iloader finishes. First, it does more hardware
initialization. Then, it sets up the environment for booting the
Linux kernel by uncompressing the Linux kernel image. Finally, it
jumps to the kernel code to begin the main Linux startup
sequence.</p><p>To make things clearer, consider elinux. The final elinux
image, which we call an elinux ball, is packed as a single file
containing three items:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>statically linked iloader executable binary</p></li><li><p>our zImage consisting of the uncompressed kernel
image vmlinux.bin.gz plus kloader</p></li><li><p>compressed root file system image ramdisk.gz</p></li></ol></div><p>The size of an elinux ball depends on how many services and
programs are included. In our experiments, it is limited to 2MB,
which is big enough for most situations. If larger programs are
needed, they can be downloaded after the system is up. It is good
to keep the ball small. The packing is simply done by a tool called
<span   class="bold"><b>packbd</b></span> (packing binaries and data
images). The elinux ball is obtained using the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
packbd iloader kloader vmlinux.bin.gz ramdisk.gz\
elinux
</pre>


<span   class="bold"><b>iloader</b></span> is the entry point to
start the elinux ball. Because it is ROM-able, the whole elinux
ball is also ROM-able. However, we don't have to put it into ROM to
boot the system. Actually, in our development, we use the native
networking service TFTP to download the elinux ball into a RAM area
and start execution.
</p><p>The implementations of iloader, kloader and packbd are
straightforward for any system, except for hardware initialization
which usually requires more effort.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1324580.0x14145a0"></a>Modifying the Kernel</h2></div></div><p>Kernel modification is the hardest part of porting.
Fortunately, Linux has been designed to be portable, with its
sources well-organized into a tree structure. Once you have made
considerable investigations into the kernel sources, the things to
do become clear. As we mentioned earlier, changes and even new
pieces of code are required when porting Linux to a new board.
Basically, all board-dependent code must be modified or adjusted
even if we use a Linux-supported processor. Changes are also needed
when we have new requirements or any bug fixes. Most are
concentrated in a few files, so hopefully this can help us
conveniently catch up with new releases.</p><p>We used the experimental kernel version 2.1.132 PPC port for
elinux. Almost all changes are limited to the board-dependent
parts, that is, in the subdirectory linux/arch/ppc for our PowerPC
board. Dozens of changes have been made; many for adapting to the
new hardware, other things for bug fixes and new requirements such
as new memory mapping.</p><p>Major changes for elinux include those for hardware
initialization, PCI bus initialization, memory management, timer
processing and interrupt processing.</p><p>Hardware initialization is the ugliest part in elinux. The
loader iloader should do the most essential part of the job, such
as initialization of the memory controller and PCI controller.
However, our implementation of iloader simply ignores this part
because we find it is unnecessary to do it again after the board's
ROM code has done it. Of course, iloader has to do it if iloader is
the first code to run from ROM. The kernel initialization does
others such as memory protection and bus device
initialization.</p><p>The original PPC port talks with PCI devices through
interfaces with the BIOS. For our board, we assume there is no
similar thing. We just leave the interfaces empty at the beginning.
Whenever we add a new PCI device, we write code directly to set up
the related base addresses, IRQs and access methods.</p><p>A few considerations are necessary for memory management.
Although we don't need any changes in the major parts for memory
management such as virtual memory management and paging, we do have
modification requests. They are mainly for setting up the
particular memory sizes and ranges, re-arranging the memory during
the kernel startup, the use of PowerPC BAT (Block Address
Translation) register pairs and memory mappings between physical
and virtual addresses.</p><p>For timer processing, two things are modified. One is to
adjust the parameters to set the PowerPC's decrementer to suit the
board's bus rate. This decrementer is used to generate a timer
interrupt every jiffy time (10 milliseconds). The other change is
to provide the interface with direct access to the Real Time Clock
(RTC) on board.</p><p>Another major change is for the interrupt controller. This
controller is simple and controls only 16 IRQs through a status
register, a mask register and a latch register. All the registers
are 16 bits. Each bit corresponds to one IRQ. New simple code is
added to handle it.</p><p>We have successfully relocated the kernel in the virtual
space by redefining the symbol <b  >KERNELBASE</b> as a
Makefile macro. This involves a few changes in the kernel
initialization code. Since we are able to relocate the kernel, we
can reserve the space for some special purposes. For example, to
load the kernel at the address 0xa0000000 instead of the default
address 0xc0000000, we just define <b  >KERNELBASE</b> in
the top Makefile this way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
KERNELBASE = 0xa0000000
</pre><p>Minor changes are made in various Makefiles. These are
necessary because we need new rules to create the elinux ball, we
have a few new files to compile and link, and we found bugs in the
Makefile when doing cross-compiling.
</p><p>As for device drivers, we are concerned only with the serial
driver for the console port. Other drivers may be added later if
necessary, such as a LAN driver and drivers to control customized
devices. During our experiments, we communicate with elinux using
<span   class="bold"><b>minicom</b></span> over a serial port. We use
the serial driver from the Linux code drivers/char/serial.c. A
minor change is made for adjusting the baud rate, and another
change is made in its header file since the serial port has a
different IRQ number.</p><p>After all is done properly, we see through the console that
elinux starts and runs happily.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1324580.0x1414c28"></a>Creating the Kernel Image and the Root
Image</h2></div></div><p>As discussed previously, the elinux ball needs a statically
linked kernel image and a root file image. Their preparation needs
some skills.</p><p>The Linux source provides the rules to create various kernel
images for different platforms. For our system, we need a
compressed binary kernel image, vmlinux.bin.gz. The steps to create
it are, in order, configuration, compiling and linking,
transferring to binary format and compressing. In configuration,
make sure the RAM disk support and the initial root file system
support are selected, and that all unnecessary options are
disabled. Compile and link the kernel for the ELF executable called
<span   class="bold"><b>vmlinux</b></span>. Then transfer to binary
format and compress it by commands such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(CROSS_COMPILE)objcopy -S -O binary vmlinux\
vmlinux.bin
gzip -vf9 vmlinux.bin
</pre><p>Because we choose to mount an initial root file system in RAM
after the kernel is up, we have to prepare a root image, called
ramdisk.gz, and put it into the elinux ball. We do this by creating
an EXT2 file system in a 4MB RAM disk on the cross-development
platform. Next, create the subdirectories such as /etc, /dev, /bin
and /lib. Then, copy scripts, binaries, device nodes, etc. onto the
RAM disk. Finally, compress the RAM disk image and get ramdisk.gz.
For example, to create a RAM disk in /dev/ram1, type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
rdev -r /dev/ram1 4096
</pre>


Make a file system and mount it to /tmp by typing:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mke2fs -vm0 /dev/ram1 4096
mount /dev/ram1 tmp
</pre>


To create a device, use <b  >cp -d</b> or
<span   class="bold"><b>mknod</b></span> in this way:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mknod ttyS0 c 4 64
</pre>


This creates a device node for the serial console port on elinux,
with major number 4 and minor number 64.
</p><p>After everything in /tmp is ready, compress it by
typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dd if=/dev/ram1 bs=1k count=4096 |
gzip -v9 &gt; ramdisk.gz
</pre><p>What should be included in the initial root RAM disk will
depend on our requirements. We copy a minimum number of shared
libraries, plus some programs like bash and vi for tests.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1324580.0x1415150"></a>Debugging Support</h2></div></div><p>Bugs are inevitable. &ldquo;Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are
shallow&rdquo; is only partly true. Most often, we have to debug without
outside help. Debugging may be painful, especially for system
booting. There is a booting debugging tool supported by special
hardware, but we don't want to rely on it. Other debugging
mechanisms such as <span   class="bold"><b>printk</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>gdb</b></span> help in many cases, but they
need too many system services. For example, the Linux kernel
debugging support, printk, works only after the system is ready to
write to a console or the file system. If the system crashes before
that time, we get nothing from printk, even if printk uses a memory
buffer to store information earlier in the process.</p><p>Simplicity means efficiency in this case. To help solve the
problem, we add <span   class="bold"><b>rprintf</b></span>. It is a
simple printing function using raw output, which writes characters
directly to the console I/O port without any buffering and any
other support. <span   class="bold"><b>rprintf</b></span> is like
printf, but based only on this kind of raw output. It works very
soon after the iloader runs, so it can be used to debug kloader and
the Linux kernel as well. <span   class="bold"><b>rprintf</b></span>
helps us solve most problems in the early stages of booting. We did
have a few problems before rprintf is initialized, but we are not
helpless. Our suggestion is to insert an operation to force a
system reboot; in this way, you can locate the problem soon. We
assume you know when the board starts rebooting. We provide a
function called <span   class="bold"><b>rreboot</b></span> to do this
job for our board by simply jumping to the system reboot entry
point in ROM.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1324580.0x14154c0"></a>Concluding Remarks</h2></div></div><p>Unlike other projects, this work relies heavily on the
Internet. We have learned much about Linux and obtained resources
such as the kernel code and Linux-related documentation from the
Web. To do something meaningful on Linux, follow proven patterns by
utilizing open-source code as much as possible. Reuse pieces of
code that run, even if changes are required. Don't be too ambitious
in the beginning. Spend plenty of time on investigation before
moving on to the next stage. Also, take the time to have a good
design at the beginning and choose good debugging support. Always
refer to Linux books and web sites first whenever you need help
(see Resources). Readers can easily discover a huge amount of
related information on the Web.</p><p>The same thing can be done in several ways. Our experiments
are far from comprehensive, but we are confident in Linux's
potential in some embedded systems. We hope our experience will
help other people who want to port a Linux kernel to their embedded
system. There are many related issues for us to research&mdash;much fun
is ahead.</p><p><a href="3591s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
