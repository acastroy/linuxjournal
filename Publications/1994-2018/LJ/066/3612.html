    A scientific laboratory in Europe depends on Linux for
    controlling equipment used in their research.

Synchrotron Radiation Facility to build distributed embedded
controllers. The embedded systems are either PC/104-based systems,
which boot from a flashdisk, or VME crates which boot from the
network. The devices being controlled vary from serial lines to
stepper motors to CCD cameras. The control software is written
using an object-oriented toolkit that we developed, called TACO
(Telescope and Accelerator Control Objects). Using TACO all control
points are implemented as device objects. This article will
describe how we have implemented embedded controllers using Linux
and present some examples.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1850580.0x1948ef8"></a>Introduction</h2></div></div><p>What is an embedded controller? As the name indicates, an
embedded controller is a mixture of control hardware and software
which is embedded, i.e., integrated, into the equipment it is
supposed to control. Examples of where embedded controllers can be
found are abundant in daily life: printers, portable telephones,
the brakes of your car, etc. The requirements for embedded
controllers are usually that they be physically small, have a small
memory footprint, low power consumption and low cost. Most of these
requirements are dictated by the fact that controllers will be
built into hardware systems and in large production volumes.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.</b></span> Aerial view of the
ESRF nestled between the Drac and Isere rivers at the foot of the
French Alps (Grenoble).</p><p><a href="3612f1.jpg" target="_self">Figure 1</a></p><p>At the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, see
Figure 1), our main job is to connect a wide variety of control
hardware with an equally large number of different interfaces. We
are faced with the task of interfacing hundreds of power supplies
to control the accelerator magnets which guide the electrons,
thousands of stepper motors which move and position the experiments
on the beamlines and a myriad of other devices. Most of these
devices contain embedded controllers which export their
functionality via a dedicated interface such as a serial line,
parallel interface or computer bus to the outside world. Our task
consists of determining how to interface these different hardware
devices in a coherent and efficient manner so that higher-level
software (often not written by us) can access it easily.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1850580.0x19491b8"></a>The European Synchrotron Radiation
Facility</h2></div></div><p>The ESRF, located in Grenoble, France, is a multinational
research institute supported by 15 participating countries. The
ESRF is operated as a non-profit enterprise under French law.
Management is supervised by a Council whose delegates are
designated by the member parties.</p><p>This large experimental facility performs basic and applied
research in physics, chemistry, material and life sciences. The
research is facilitated through the use of a powerful source of
radiation in the X-ray range. This synchrotron radiation, used at
experimental stations called beamlines, has remarkable
capabilities. Pushing the technological limits, the ESRF performs
novel experiments which have not been feasible before.</p><p>The construction of the ESRF started in 1988. The
inauguration and opening of the first 15 beamlines to scientific
users took place in September 1994. Currently, 40 beamlines are
operating 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. More information about the
ESRF can be found on their web site at
<a href="http://www.esrf.fr" target="_self">http://www.esrf.fr/</a>.</p><p>Our answer to the interface problem has been to use Ethernet
and the TCP/IP protocol as the ubiquitous interface for all
devices. We have developed an object-oriented toolkit called TACO
for wrapping all devices and then exporting them to the external
world (our users) as objects on the network, accessible via an
application programmer's interface (API). In order to wrap the
different pieces of hardware, we often build embedded controllers
close to the hardware which run the TACO wrapper software and make
the hardware available via the network.</p><p>We will describe two types of embedded controllers which we
build using Linux&mdash;PC/104-based controllers and VME-based
controllers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1850580.0x1949478"></a>Why Linux?</h2></div></div><p>Why use Linux for embedded controllers? Although the choice
to use Linux is obvious to many readers, the reasons are not always
the same. In our case, we needed an operating system with the
following features: highly configurable, excellent TCP/IP stack
implementation, easy to program when it comes to writing device
drivers, modern programming standard (e.g., POSIX, CORBA, Java,
HTTP) support, stable, well-supported and not too expensive. Linux
fulfills all these requirements and more. The fact that Linux is
free and comes with the source makes it even more
attractive.</p><p>Before Linux, we used commercial operating systems for
embedded controllers and after two years of working with Linux, we
noticed the difference. Gone are the days of flaky TCP/IP
implementations, silence as an answer to our bug reports (now that
we have the source, we can even fix the bugs ourselves), expensive
contracts, lack of modern products and no one to talk to about our
work. The choice of Linux for our embedded systems has meant that
we now have the same OS from the low level to the desktop to our
Beowulf cluster.</p><p>Choosing Linux does not mean that all questions have been
answered, however. Questions remain, such as &ldquo;When will industry
embrace Linux?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How long will Linux last?&rdquo; The answer to
the first one is soon&mdash;we hope. The answer to the second is not
forever, of course. As with any product/phenomenon, Linux will not
last forever. At the ESRF, we renew our control systems roughly
every ten years. It is important that Linux continues to exist for
this time. In the worst-case scenario, we still have the
source.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1850580.0x1949630"></a>Embedding Linux</h2></div></div><p>Having chosen Linux as our OS, we chose VME (for historical
reasons) and PC/104 for our hardware. Strictly speaking, VME is not
an embedded controller. It is a bus-based system which offers the
ability to plug many I/O cards into a single crate. The I/O cards
can communicate with the hardware without being aware of any other
cards in the crate, or they can rely on other cards to do part of
the work. This is one of the strengths of VME.</p><p>Why talk about VME if it is not a true embedded controller?
Because we configure our VME systems like embedded controllers.
They are totally diskless, i.e., they have only RAM on board, boot
a generic image from the network, and in fact, resemble a general
purpose I/O embedded controller (see Figure 2).</p><p>PC/104 is, however, a true embedded controller. It is a
small-format PC which can be stacked together with I/O cards to
form a dedicated controller. It is low-cost, low in power
consumption, small and ideal for performing dedicated tasks. How do
we configure Linux to boot and run on these two formats? Read
on....</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.</b></span> Paolo standing

goal of creating a low-cost, networked I/O device controller for
distributed control systems. TacoBox is a very simple device with
an I/O interface for the physical device to be controlled. The I/O
interface is specified by the TACO I/O class as a set of commands
possible to use with the physical device. Imagine a TacoBox as a
black box which speaks TACO protocol as input and process I/O as
output. The user interface is accessed via Ethernet using two major
protocols. The configuration and (some) maintenance operations of
the I/O interface can be done using an ordinary web browser.</p><p>We use the PC/104 form factor CPU and I/O boards to build
TacoBoxes. A PC/104 is essentially an IBM-compatible PC in an
embedded, industrial format. It is built around a 104-pin
stack-through connector which is electrically compatible with the
8- and 16-bit ISA bus (PC-XT and PC-AT). The PC/104+ has an
additional 32-bit bus, electrically compatible with the PCI bus.
The PC/104 form factor is small, 90 x 95 mm. It is stackable, which
means you can build a PC/104 system in a very small space. In a
recent survey, PC/104-based systems were the third best-selling
embedded bus system standard after VME and CompactPCI. The first
prototypes of PC/104 ran under commercial real-time operating
systems (RTOS) with limited on-board resources. When we got
interested in Linux, we immediately wanted to install it on
TacoBox. At first, we started with the same configuration as we
used with those RTOS installations. We learned quite a bit about
the different embedded Linux distributions out there. But we also
learned that with just a little more money, we could get a
Pentium-90 level PC/104 Single Board Computer (SBC) with 20MB of
DRAM, IDE-interface, plus Ethernet (we used JUMPTec's MOPS/586).
Add a hard disk and floppy drive, a SVGA card, a screen, a keyboard
and a mouse and you have an &ldquo;old-fashioned&rdquo; desktop PC. On a
desktop PC, you can install Linux without any problem, thanks to
some great Linux distributions. At the ESRF, SuSE Linux 5.3 was
installed on our desktop machines. Within a few hours, we had a
desktop PC/104.</p><p>We fit all that in a box by removing the spinning hard disk
first and replacing it with a solid-state, IDE-compatible, 24MB
FlashPROM hard disk. It piggybacks neatly on the SBC. You do not
want to write on a FlashPROM too often, because it is slow and will
not support many continuous writing operations. Therefore, the root
file system on the FlashPROM is mounted read-only and all the live
files and directories are placed on the initial RAM disk, the
/initrd. How do you fit a SuSE Linux distribution in 24MB? You give
up Perl, Apache and man pages to get to that size. Again, it is a
question of money, since FlashPROM disks with up to 200MB are
available. What about the SVGA, the screen and other desktop
decoration? Configure a serial line system console, and rip them
all out.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1850580.0x1949b00"></a>VME</h2></div></div><p>A farm of 250 VME bus-based systems is running here. All are
running diskless and booting from a UNIX machine using BOOTP/TFTP
protocols. The VME Single Board Computers used at the ESRF (see
Figure 3) are MVME-167, with 8, 16 or 32MB of memory, and
MVME-162-522, with 8 or 16MB of memory. When we wanted to install
Linux on this platform, we looked for information on the Internet
and were pleasantly surprised to find Richard Hirst's site about
Linux for 680x0-based VME boards. What a relief to find such
professional support for what we thought would be a major job for
months to come.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.</b></span> Example of
diskless VME crates used as general purpose input/output boxes. The
lower crate (with the box of tacos in it) is running Linux and
being used to control a high-resolution encoder card. The upper
crate is running a commercial OS to control a variety of
input/output cards. Work is in progress to port all the software
from the commercial OS to Linux while staying in VME format.</p><p><a href="3612f3.jpg" target="_self">Figure 3</a></p><p>Richard's distribution is for disk-based systems, so he
helped us sort out some problems with the NFS-root-based systems. A
very useful package that we added on our systems is Nick Holgate's
TFTPLILO package, which allows us to have just one Linux boot image
for all our Linux/68k VME systems.</p><p>We keep boot images for Linux/68k VME systems, as they are
used on our FTP server
(<a href="ftp://ftp.esrf.fr/pub/cs/ess/linux" target="_self">ftp://ftp.esrf.fr/pub/cs/ess/linux/</a>).
This allows all our collaborators to test device drivers and other
software in a similar configuration as ours. It also allows any
owner of a MVME-167 or a MVME-162-522 board to try Linux/68k
without any investment or other hassle.</p><p>If you have already jumped on your keyboard, you may have
noticed we are using the Debian file system and the 2.0.33 kernel.
The good news is that Debian now includes support for MVME-16x,
MVME-17x and BVM VME bus Single Computer Boards.</p><p>Writing a device driver for a VME bus-based Linux computer
requires knowing something about the VME bus and its principles of
operation. Briefly, VME bus is an asynchronous bus that allows
multiple bus masters, but (luckily) only one arbiter. It has seven
daisy-chained interrupt lines that on most SBCs can be re-mapped to
different local interrupt levels. The access to VME bus I/O boards
is entirely memory-mapped, again with some physical translation
between the local memory address and the VME bus address. All this
is usually managed by some complex chips, such as Vmechip2 from
Motorola. Writing a device driver for VMEbus requires some
understanding of the interface chip. Our ftp site contains examples
of general purpose Vmechip2 device drivers. It is good idea to read
through those drivers before moving ahead to more complex device
drivers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1850580.0x1c54ce0"></a>TACO</h2></div></div><p>To provide a unified software interface to many different
pieces of hardware with as many different kinds of hardware
interfaces, we have developed an object-oriented toolkit called
TACO for doing just that. It is also used at the Hartbeesthoek
Radio Astronomy Observatory in South Africa (see Resources) for
controlling a radio telescope, and will be used at the FRM II
research reactor in Germany for controlling future
experiments.</p><p>TACO unifies the software interface with the hardware and the
way control software is written by providing a framework for
developing control objects. Each control point is implemented in a
Device class as a method. At runtime, the Device classes create as
many copies of Device objects as there are pieces of hardware, and
export their functionality onto the network. The Device objects are
served by Device servers, which are stand-alone processes under
Linux. Clients (which can be graphical GUIs or other Device
objects) access the Device objects via the Device Server API
(DSAPI).</p><p>The network addressing is managed by a database (implemented
with <span   class="bold"><b>gdbm</b></span>) and the network
protocol by the ONC RPC (from Sun, which is now part of glibc).
RPCs make network calls look like local procedure calls. The ONC
RPC is the basis of NFS. This means it can be found on all systems
where NFS has been ported, i.e., just about everywhere. It requires
one extra process to be running per host&mdash;the portmapper, which
manages the mapping of program number to local port numbers.
Performance overhead induced by an RPC over the network is on the
order of a few milliseconds. The memory footprint is less than 100
kilobytes per server, linked with shared libraries (TACO API's,
glibc and pthreads).</p><p>The DSAPI implements various flavours of network calls needed
for doing controls&mdash;synchronous (client blocks waiting for the
answer), asynchronous (client continues immediately and retrieves
answer later) and events (client registers interest in an event and
gets sent events asynchronously). It also implements a large number
of standard types, timeouts, UDP and TCP protocols and stateless
connections. Device classes can be written in C or C++. The
database is used to store and retrieve device-dependent
information. Interfaces to high-level scripting languages such as
Tcl, LabView, SPEC and Mathlab are available. Clients can also be
written in C, C++ or Java.</p><p>Because of its simple approach, TACO scales easily. It has
been used for laboratory systems consisting of a single device
right up to an entire synchrotron which consists of more than
10,000 devices. We use TACO to control everything from simple
digital I/O to entire data acquisition systems.</p><p>We are presently working on the next generation of TACO
called TANGO (TAco Next Generation Objects). In TANGO, CORBA will
replace ONC RPC, and it will be possible to write Device classes in
Java as well as C++.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1850580.0x1c54ff8"></a>Examples of Embedded Controllers</h2></div></div><p>We started using Linux in embedded controllers approximately
one year ago. To date, we have built the following
controllers.</p><p>Serial Line Controller</p><p>We have traditionally used a VME-based board with 16/18 ports
to control RS-232 and RS-422 serial lines. We have thousands of
serial lines today to control vacuum devices, power supplies, PLCs,
etc. As the number of devices requiring serial lines increases each
day (and in some crates, we have reached the maximum number of
serial line VME boards), we started looking for a new system, which
would be cheaper than the existing VME-based system and would be
PC-based. (Many of the serial line devices are certified only on
PCs.) That is how we came to the PC/104. Cost is not the only
reason for changing: we also wanted to implement new technologies,
like web support, for better maintenance and configuration of the
serial lines. We wanted as many serial lines as the VME-based
system; therefore, we looked for a PC/104 board with eight ports
which we could stack. Unfortunately, the choice of boards with more
than 4 ports is limited. We finally chose the Parvus Octal Serial
card.</p><p>This board is a so-called &ldquo;dumb multiport serial&rdquo; board,
based on two 16554 UART (which are compatible with the standard
16650 UART) plus a programmable gate array for the address and UART
register mapping on the ISA bus. As this board is quite new, we
encountered some problems with the on-board gate array (bugs and
limitations of programming) but we also found workarounds. To
integrate this board in our Linux TacoBox, we used the standard
serial line driver of the kernel (2.0.35). It implements IRQ
sharing; thus, we consume only one IRQ for the eight ports of a
Parvus board.</p><p>Before accessing the extended serial lines through the system
device descriptors <span   class="bold"><b>/dev/ttyS</b></span>, we
have several setup steps. All are processed from a single homemade
script. Therefore, to install one (or more) Parvus boards, we need
to add a single line to the booting scripts. We added a call to our
script in the /etc/rc.d/serial file.</p><p>The first step is to set up the Parvus card gate array. We
wrote a C program to access the gate array registers. The script
picks up all the parameters needed for the call to this program and
for configuring the serial lines from an easy-to-understand and
modify ASCII file. Then the device descriptors /dev/cuaxx and
/dev/ttySxx are created. Since we use the standard driver, the
major numbers are the same as the ones used for the CPU board
serial lines (4 for ttySxx and 5 for cuaxx). As with any other dumb
multiport card, the minor numbers start from 64. At this step, we
also change the access permissions to the device descriptors to
allow any user to use the serial lines.</p><p>The last step is configuring the serial ports using the
helpful tool <span   class="bold"><b>setserial</b></span>. We set up
each port of a board with a different address but with the same
IRQ; for example, addresses 0x100, 0x108 and IRQ 12 for one board
and addresses 0x140, 0x148 and IRQ 9 for the other board. At this
point, the serial ports are fully integrated in the operating
system and can be used from any program.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3612f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Manuel (aka RastaMan) after a heavy day of debugging the
serial line TacoBox, feeling like he has serial lines coming out of
his head.
</p></div></div><p>For our embedded controller, we ported the existing
serial-line TACO device server from our commercial OS to Linux. The
new device server uses POSIX calls to interface with the
serial-line driver and should therefore work with any OS supporting
POSIX. The compatibility of the two device servers and the use of
TACO allows us to interchange a VME-based system with a
PC/104-based system without changing the client application.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1850580.0x1c555d0"></a>Stepper Motor Controller</h2></div></div><p>The experiments conducted at the ESRF beamlines require
precise positioning of many motors to move goniometers, slits,
translation stages, etc. Typically, a beamline has more than a
hundred stepper motors to align the beamline and move the sample
during the experiment (see Figure 5). Motors can be divided into
two types: those which can be moved independently and those which
have to be moved in sync with the data-taking process. For the
independent motors, a TacoBox based on an embedded PC/104-based
controller board is ideal&mdash;it is compact and can be installed close
to the hardware. For the synchronized movements, VME is the
preferred solution. It allows us to synchronize the motor movements
with the data acquisition via the VME bus without requiring any
extra cables.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 5.</b></span> An example of
motor positioning on a beamline&mdash;a 6-legged hexapod used to
position the crystal in the beam to select only a single wavelength
of the beam.</p><p><a href="3612f5.jpg" target="_self">Figure 5</a></p><p>In order to kill two birds with one stone, we chose a stepper
motor controller which exists in PC/104 and VME format&mdash;the PC68
and VME58 from Oregon Micro Systems. These cards supports step
rates of up to 1MHz, very useful for microstepping where the steps
are divided by a factor of 1000 to ensure precise positioning. Both
cards implement the same ASCII-based controller language. They
differ in their register mappings on the bus (one is Intel I/O
port-based and the other is m68k memory mapped). The differences
are implemented (and hidden) at the level of the device driver.
This ensures the TACO device server is identical for both cards. We
were fortunate enough to get outside help from Richard Hirst
(again) to write the device driver, which is based on an initial
version we found on the OMS web site written by Tony Denault of the
Institute of Astronomy, Hawaii. The driver implements
<span   class="bold"><b>ioctl</b></span> calls to read position and
status and to pass commands to the board. A multi-threaded device
server which supports events was developed at the ESRF (based on an
initial version by Lucile Roussier of Lure Laboratory in Paris).
The server uses POSIX threads on Linux/m68k and Linux/x86. All the
software (device driver and server) is available under the GPL from
our FTP site at
<a href="ftp://ftp.esrf.fr/pub/cs/ess/linux/drivers/oms" target="_self">ftp://ftp.esrf.fr/pub/cs/ess/linux/drivers/oms/</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 6.</b></span> Paolo and Andy in
their bug-fighting gear with the stepper motor TacoBox (second
shelf from the top on the right-hand side) in its rack on the ID27
beamline clean room. The other boxes are the stepper motor power
drivers and the TacoBox power supply.</p><p><a href="3612f6.jpg" target="_self">Figure 6</a></p><p>The PC/104 controller consists of a JumpTEC 486 CPU board and
the OMS PC68 controller stacked together (see Figure 6). The
TacoBox boots Linux from flashdisk, loads the device driver module,
creates as many device descriptors as needed (using major number
26), then starts the device server. On VME, an extra step is needed
to program the Vmechip2 according to the ESRF addressing
standard.</p><p>Once the device server is running, the client requests the
server to move the motors. A minor problem we had was ensuring that
the PC68 card did not clash with any I/O address already in use,
e.g., the address of the network card. This is easy to determine by
listing (using <span   class="bold"><b>cat</b></span>) the
/proc/ioports file and choosing one that is not attributed. A more
serious problem was with the VME version of the card and the way it
handles interrupts when hitting a limit switch. In the end, we
abandoned using interrupts with limits; we simply read the status
register to find out if a limit had been hit.</p><p>For the stepper motor-based TacoBox, the usual PC/104 cabling
problems are reduced somewhat because there is only a single flat
cable for the motor controller and an Ethernet cable to connect.
The entire box cost us approximately 2000 euros for four stepper
motor channels and 3000 euros for eight channels (using the PC68
extension board). In our application, we use the PC68 as a simple
stepper motor controller; we haven't tried the other features yet
(e.g., support for relative encoders, dc motors and servo
loops).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1850580.0x1c55c00"></a>Collaborating On Device Drivers</h2></div></div><p>Today, the main drawback of Linux for our applications is
still the lack of device drivers for many kinds of I/O boards. PC
boards are better supported than VME, but still lag far behind
Windows drivers. Our aim is to install as many Linux-based
controllers as possible because of their better stability, ease of
programming, flexibility, lower cost, etc. In order to achieve
this, we need drivers, drivers and yet more drivers.</p><p>We are only a small team working on device drivers and are
therefore very interested in collaborating with other programmers
on device drivers for all kinds of boards. All our drivers are
developed under GPL and made available to the external world on our
FTP site.</p><p>We would be interested in hearing from anyone who has written
a device driver for an I/O board for PC/104 or VME. Please send
e-mail to one of the authors to add your driver or name to our
database, which we will make available on our web site.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1850580.0x1c55db8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>We hope this article has given you a taste of how to build
embedded controllers using Linux and how Linux is being used in a
research institute like the ESRF. All our software is available
free of charge (and guarantee), with source code. At present, we
have built only a few embedded controllers based on Linux, but we
plan to build many more in the future. Should any real-time
problems crop up, we will explore them using RTLinux.</p><p>Linux has proven to be a great OS for collaboration. All of
our software comes from the Internet, and we have often had direct
contact with the authors. We hope to collaborate with more device
driver programmers in the future to bring the list of Linux device
drivers up to be at least as long as for Windows, if not
longer.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 7.</b></span> Is it Richard
