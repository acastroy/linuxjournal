which has existed on several platforms for a number of years and
has just recently been made available for Linux. Metrowerks is
releasing two versions of CodeWarrior for Red Hat Linux (with SuSE
releases to follow): the GNU Edition and the Professional Edition.
The GNU Edition is the subject for today.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6c580.0x1c64ad8"></a>The IDE</h2></div></div><p>An integrated development environment, as in the case of
CodeWarrior, is a graphical environment incorporating the main
elements of software development. This includes managing the
project, dependencies, libraries, editing code, compiling,
debugging, linking and all of the usual coding tasks. It does not
include paint programs or other multimedia tools that could be used
in software development. Essentially, the idea of the IDE (not to
be confused with Integrated Drive Electronics) is to combine all
these things under one interface for easy project management. This
is a different approach from using Emacs in one virtual console
while running <span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span> in another and
editing the Makefile in a third. An IDE will presumably take care
of the entire project, and one can easily call up whichever parts
of the program need editing and have the computer keep track of
changes to the Makefile (or what would be the Makefile). This
approach has its advantages and disadvantages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6c580.0x1c64c38"></a>The Advantage</h2></div></div><p>The principal advantage of the IDE is that it is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>easy</em></span>; the program takes care of everything and
lets you concentrate exclusively on your code. On machines without
the <span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> command, this can be
completely wonderful, and even on Linux, many users have wished
that someone would port CodeWarrior. Now it is available, and the
development environment is basically the same as on other
platforms, so migrating from other operating systems (or between,
if you must) is even easier.</p><p>Because development is such a large part of the Linux
movement, people are very sensitive to all sorts of programming
issues, including devout preferences for certain keystrokes over
others and one editor over another. CodeWarrior is flexible in
these areas, allowing (or requiring) third-party products such as
editors and debuggers. However, some shortcomings are applicable to
the open-source, multi-platform world of GNU/Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6c580.0x1c64e48"></a>Development Issues</h2></div></div><p>One advantage of the CodeWarrior IDE is that it eliminates
the complications involved in writing and maintaining a Makefile.
Probably the main disadvantage is that it eliminates the advanced
functionality and power that go along with the Makefile. This means
that on one level, anything you write with CodeWarrior cannot be
compiled on non-CodeWarrior systems unless you write your own
Makefile to correspond with the CodeWarrior .mpc file (not a
difficult task). The other side of this problem is that if you want
to use CodeWarrior to hack some typical open-source software, you
have to convert the Makefile first. Frankly, this is often quite
difficult, and it defeats a large part of the purpose of an
IDE&mdash;you might do just as well or better with Emacs/vi/joe/pico in
one window and a terminal running make in another.</p><p>One possible solution would be for Metrowerks to add a
Makefile importer <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> exporter. (Macintosh and
Windows versions are said to have a Makefile importer, though I
have not had a chance to use it.) If there were an open-source
version of this converter for Linux, developers who use CodeWarrior
could easily cooperate with those who use other IDEs or the usual
combination of Emacs (or vi) and make. A two-way converter may be a
mildly difficult undertaking, considering the flexibility of make
(with <span   class="bold"><b>configure</b></span>) compared to .mpc
which is quite specialized. Still, it would be nice. So, although
CodeWarrior may make cross-platform development much easier, it may
slightly complicate cross-UNIX development. KDE developers in
particular may be annoyed that it is difficult to use extended C++
class libraries like Qt. (I had trouble getting KDE programs to
compile.)</p><p>Serious programmers may find other limitations. For example,
third-party products (such as the debugger) are not integrated into
the IDE, they are just loaded for you. Also, CodeWarrior does not
support the Gnome/KDE drag-and-drop standards (who expects this?),
and there seems to be no support for languages outside of C/C++
except as provided by <span   class="bold"><b>egcs</b></span> (for
example, you can write in assembler). Also, if you would like to
use KAI's C++ or any compiler other than gcc/egcs, the GNU Edition
of CodeWarrior does not support it&mdash;this edition is based
exclusively on free development tools. Now that we know what
CodeWarrior is not, we can take a look at what CodeWarrior does
have to offer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6c580.0x1c65108"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Although installing the CodeWarrior IDE is quite simple
(./install.sh from the root directory of the CD-ROM), getting a
fully functioning system can be a bit complicated and involves some
compilation. That is, if you want DDD (DataDisplayDebugger, a
graphical front end for several debuggers including
<span   class="bold"><b>gdb</b></span>), you have to get it from the
CD-ROM, and if you want to do C++ development, you have to get
egcs-1.1.2 from the CD-ROM, compile and install it (unless you have
these things already). Also, you must edit your profile (or make
symlinks) so that egcs will be used instead of gcc. Probably anyone
fluent enough in Linux to develop projects, which need to be
managed and integrated, can also unpack a .tgz file using
<b  >tar -xzf</b> and run <b  >make</b>. Still,
these things ought to have automatic installation available&mdash;ease
of use is supposedly one of the benefits of commercial software.
Since CodeWarrior currently exists for only Red Hat 5.2 and 6.0
(with SuSE soon to come), it should not be that difficult to make
an easier, automatic installation program.</p><p>One element of installation which long-time free software
users may find amusing is the license. When you start the
install.sh script, you are greeted by several pages' worth of a
&ldquo;licensing agreement&rdquo; which you must accept or the software won't
install. The language is a bit pushy legalese, but somehow it's
awfully funny to find something like this on Linux. (After all, who
ever reads that stuff when Netscape first starts up?) I don't know
if these last-minute licenses are legally binding, although you can
supposedly return the software to the dealer and obtain a refund if
you disagree. Either way, the software is more useful if you choose
to install it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6c580.0x1c65370"></a>Look and Feel</h2></div></div><p><a href="3654f2.jpg" target="_self">Figure 1. CodeWarrior Screenshot</a></p><p>Ideally, an integrated development environment should be a
pleasant one. This means users should like the various menus,
buttons, windows, bars, other functional interfaces, the debugger
and most of all the editor (unless you spend more time in the
debugger). CodeWarrior's editor is neat enough; it puts comments,
keywords and strings in different colors than the main code, which
is nice for some people. (Actually, it <span   class="emphasis"><em>would</em></span>
be neat if console editors did this more easily.) In fact, you can
customize all sorts of coloration into the editor. It does not,
however, automatically parse and produce attractive C code the way
Emacs does. Also, scrolling the page with the scroll bar or the
PageUp/PageDown keys leaves the cursor where it was, so once you
find the correct line, it gets lost when you press a cursor key
(you must click with the mouse to get your cursor to the right
location). This could be good or bad, depending on whether you tend
to scroll through the code and either forget where you began or
forget which line you found.</p><p>As far as windows and menus are concerned, everything is laid
out in logical places and the menu entries are diverse enough to
offer a lot of varied functionality, while at the same time there
are not more entries than there ought to be. The file menu is
straightforward and simple, although the scroll bar does not scroll
through files in real time; that is, it updates the screen when
you've finished moving the bar. The Search menu has much to offer
for searching, the Project menu contains a whole bunch of
project-oriented functions (this is where you &ldquo;make&rdquo;), the Debug
has many apparently permanently ghosted options (the debugger is
not integrated with CodeWarrior&mdash;only loaded by it), there is a
Window menu for dealing with the numerous windows of code, and an
Info menu which actually has some configuration options for the
IDE. All in all, it's actually fairly easy and obvious to get
around and code. People who have never used CodeWarrior before may
nevertheless find it familiar, and perhaps somewhat eerie, when the
machine knows exactly what to do despite being given somewhat vague
instructions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6c580.0x1c655d8"></a>Application Demo</h2></div></div><p>As a short and clever method for introducing people to the
CodeWarrior IDE, Metrowerks has included an Application Tutorial
which is a version of GNUGO, edited to include a couple of bugs so
that you can learn the debugger. The application tutorial goes
through the steps of importing the source-code package into
CodeWarrior, editing, compiling and debugging it. One curious
quality of the 70-page manual in which these instructions are
detailed is that often the details are not exactly correct. Still,
it is not difficult to figure out what is actually meant (for
example, select &ldquo;Break at&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Set Breakpoint&rdquo;).</p><p>The &ldquo;walk-through&rdquo; is just that, plain and simple, yet
adequate to introduce a user to the steps of program development.
The learning curve is, well, short. From the moment CodeWarrior
booted, I could intuit everything I would need to do. The names of
functions are self-explanatory, the software never once crashed or
froze (even temporarily), and the only thing that confused me was I
had to change permissions on the source directory (chmod 777,
actually) before I could get started. Also, I appreciate that
Metrowerks chose GNUGO for the demo program because this excellent
game is often overlooked.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6c580.0x1c65738"></a>For Red Hat Linux</h2></div></div><p>At this time, CodeWarrior is available only for Red Hat
Linux, which is bound to raise some eyebrows. What would happen to
Linux if commercial vendors made their products available only to
users of certain distributions? While it is true that distributors
sometimes put important files in different places, normal software
tends to compile across distributions and across hardware
platforms, so it seems that CodeWarrior ought to work with any
distribution. It should not be more difficult than making some
symlinks or running make, so Metrowerks may have other
reasons.</p><p>While the reason for choosing Red Hat seems clear (largest
market share in the U.S.), the decision to support only one vendor
was quite strange and seemed a bit scandalous. I hope no one
switches distributions just for the ability to run CodeWarrior.
However, the news on this front is that SuSE and Metrowerks have
announced that they intend to produce and market CodeWarrior for
SuSE. While it remains a mystery why CodeWarrior is so
distribution-specific, the speculation is that Metrowerks cannot
give tech support to so many distributions, and relies on the
distributors to do so. It would be strange for a distributor to
support someone else's product, and it <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span>
better to have an unsupported product than no product at all, but
this may be the situation. Smaller distributors are at a
disadvantage, so hopefully this practice will be abandoned before
it becomes widespread.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6c580.0x1c658f0"></a>Prognosis</h2></div></div><p>Many people have been waiting for years to see CodeWarrior
show up for Linux, and for these people and anyone who likes
integrated development environments in general (very popular on
Windows), this resembles what they have been wanting. In terms of
functionality, it is not yet entirely comparable to CodeWarrior for
Macintosh or Windows, and limitations to the GNU Edition are
present. However, many coders are excited to find out what future
releases and the Professional Edition will have in store. You may
also want to take a look at the open-source Code Crusader and
Cygnus Code Fusion. Software development firms could become
especially fond of an IDE like CodeWarrior, and if this problem of
Makefile vs .mpc is resolved, it will become a viable option for
individual, at-home developers who want to contribute to the
GNU/Linux world of open-source software.</p><p>In any event, we can hope that CodeWarrior's presence on our
platform will make programming easier, thereby inspiring more
programmers. The world of GNU/Linux is extremely different from
that of Macintosh and Windows, and CodeWarrior will need to make
many adaptations to be successful. Hopefully, this product is first
in a line of efforts to bring the immensely popular CodeWarrior IDE
to Linux.</p></div></div>
