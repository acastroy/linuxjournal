commercial and noncommercial Linux applications on native Linux
platforms. It is a set of tested and certified, open-source, GNU
standard C, C++ and assembly language development tools. The
reviewed release of the product (v1.0) is a Linux-only product.
This packaging of the Toolkit is specifically targeted toward the
Linux desktop developer.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ed580.0x18e5a80"></a>GNUPro Toolkit Suites</h2></div></div><p>The compiler and development tools consist of GNU's C
compiler (ANSI conforming), C++ compiler (ANSI tracking),
assembler, C preprocessor, linker, debugger and the GNUPro visual
debugger. The GNUPro libraries include standard ANSI C runtime,
math subroutine libraries, C++ class and C++ iostreams. All of the
compiler and development tools, except
<span   class="bold"><b>gdbtk</b></span>, are command-line tools.
(<span   class="bold"><b>gdbtk</b></span> brings up the GNUPro visual
debugger). The other command-line tools function like standard GNU
tools.</p><p>A set of binary and general utilities is also included. Tools
such as objcopy, objdump, ranlib, strip, ar and nm are examples of
the included binary utilities. The general utilities provide a set
of tools for comparing and merging files. Tools such as cmp, diff,
diff3, sdiff and patch are included in the general
utilities.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ed580.0x18e5c90"></a>Visual Debugger</h2></div></div><p>For me, GNUPro's visual debugger makes debugging easier. I
like being able to see graphically what is happening. Figure 1
contains a KDE environment screen capture of the debugger's Source
Window.</p><p><a href="3455f1.jpg" target="_self">Figure 1. Source Window for the Debugger</a></p><p>Typical menu, tool, display window and status bars are
provided. The tool bar provides run, stop, function navigation and
assembler navigation buttons. Then there are the register, memory,
stack, watch expressions, local variables, break points and console
dialog box buttons. These buttons are followed by the stack
navigation buttons. Each of the function buttons implements or
executes a GNU gdb command-line interface command. The dialog
buttons open windows that display related information. The Register
Window button dynamically displays registers and their content.
Memory is dynamically displayed in the Memory Window. The current
state of the call stack is displayed in the Stack Window. The
Source Window will update its display to reflect any selections
made in the Stack Window. An &ldquo;expressions to watch&rdquo; window is
displayed by the Watch button. This window will be blank unless
expressions, registers or pointers have been identified for
watching. Current values of local variables are displayed in the
Local Variables Window. A list of all defined breakpoints is shown
in the Breakpoint Window. Another way of managing breakpoints that
may not be readily visible/accessible in the Source Window is
provided by the Breakpoint Window. A Console Window is displayed by
the console button. This window provides a command-line interface
to GNUPro Debugger.</p><p>A mouse click or static cursor within the Source Window
produces several pieces of information. The current value of a
variable is displayed when the mouse cursor is held over a
variable. Holding the cursor over a variable and right-clicking the
mouse produces a pop-up menu. This menu offers two choices: add the
item to the watch list, or dump the memory. Selecting either of
these produces a dialog box displaying the selected information.
Executable lines are shown with a minus sign on the left side of
the window. Left-clicking the mouse in this region will either add
or remove a break point. Right-clicking the mouse offers a pop-up
menu with a couple of break point management options.</p><p>Below the status line are three drop-down list boxes. All of
the source and header files associated with the executable are
presented in the left-most box. The middle box displays all
functions in the source or header currently displayed. Any of the
items in these two list boxes may be selected for display. Four
items in the right list box control what is being displayed. The
display options are source only, assembly only, source and assembly
mixed, and a split screen with source on top and assembly at the
bottom.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ed580.0x18e5f50"></a>GNUPro Toolkit Installation</h2></div></div><p>Version 1.0 for Linux of GNUPro has been tested and is
officially supported on Red Hat version 4.2 and 5.x. GNUPro also
works with Red Hat version 6 and SuSE version 6.0/6.1. Plans for
the next release of GNUPro for Linux include testing and support on
distributions other than Red Hat and SuSE. The install files
provided on the review package distribution CD-ROM media were for
Red Hat versions 4.2 and 5.1.</p><p>Installation of GNUPro on Caldera's v1.3 required a little
experimentation, some research and thinking. Cygnus FAQ pages
indicated GNUPro should install on Caldera, Debian and other Linux
distributions. With this positive reinforcement, I began installing
the product on a 300MHz Pentium with 64MB RAM and Caldera's
OpenLinux version 1.3 with KDE.</p><p>The Red Hat version 5.2 install file produced a list of
missing dependencies. It turned out the Red Hat v4.2 install file
had just one missing dependency. The version 4.2 install file was
looking for libncurses.so.3.0. OpenLinux had a later release than
the install program expected. The install program would not accept
either a soft or a hard link to libncurses. The Cygnus bug list web
page suggested a way around this specific problem. I got around
ncurses hurdle by installing GNUPro using the
<b  >nodeps</b> option. After the install had completed,
I made a soft link between libncurses.so.3.0 and libncurses.so.4.1.
Once the link had been established, the installation verification
tests executed successfully .</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ed580.0x18e6160"></a>Documentation and Support</h2></div></div><p>In general, Cygnus support was prompt, responsive to my
questions and to the point. In response to one question, they
provided some additional information in case I might be considering
upgrading to glibc 2.1.</p><p>According to the GNUPro Getting Started Manual and FAQ, HTML
copies of the six GNUPro documents (Compiler Tools, Debugger,
Libraries, Utilities, Advance Topics and Tools for Embedded
Systems) were included on the distribution CD-ROM. I was unable to
locate any HTML documentation on the CD-ROM. After roaming about
the GNUPro installation directories, I located HTML documentation
files in my install directory /usr/cygnus/redhat-980810/doc. Cygnus
support indicated that the User Guide's reference to documentation
is being corrected.</p><p>The on-line documentation is in HTML format. It requires a
web browser or some other application able to read HTML files. On
my system, I chose to use <span   class="bold"><b>kfm</b></span> to
access and display the GNUPro HTML documentation.</p><p>GNUPro Toolkit for Linux is a single-release snapshot of the
ever-evolving GNUPro product. Support for the Linux product
includes 30 days of installation support and a web page. The
support web page contains PDF and HTML documentation, FAQs, patches
and a known bug list. E-mail notification whenever the patch or bug
list pages change may be requested.</p><p>The 30-day support is for installation problems. After a
successful product install, one should not expect a personal reply
to non-installation support questions. At the time of this writing,
the primary after-installation support vehicles are the Cygnus web
site, newsgroups and mailing lists. No information on upgrade
policies for GNUPro for Linux was available.</p><p>A quick comment on GNUPro legal notices. GNUPro Toolkit
consists of software from several different sources. The terms and
conditions for copying, modifying and redistributing software
components derived from GNUPro vary. The User's Guide devotes a
short chapter to the various legal notices.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ed580.0x18e6478"></a>GNUPro Toolkit, the Full-Featured
Product</h2></div></div><p>While this review was specifically about GNUPro Toolkit for
Linux, I would be remiss if I did not briefly mention Cygnus'
GNUPro Toolkit product. The more robust, and more expensive, GNUPro
Toolkit is capable of supporting more than 125 hardware and
software environments. A wide range of host systems may be used to
develop 32- and 64-bit applications for this array of target hosts
and operating systems. Some of the many major hardware and software
players represented include HP, SGI, Sun SPARC series, Hitachi,
MIPS, NEC, Panasonic, Toshiba, Motorola, IBM RS6000 and PowerPC and
Intel's X86 series, to name a few. The Toolkit contains embedded
cross-platform compiling capabilities. No cross-platform
capabilities were included with the reviewed Toolkit for Linux
version. Cygnus has identified Linux as one of its target host
environments, so cross compiling should be on the horizon.</p><p>Cygnus offers a GNUPro subscription service for the high-end
GNUPro Toolkit product. This service provides two releases of
GNUPro each year, and access to Cygnus Developer Support.
Additional information on pricing and Developer Support services
may be obtained by contacting Cygnus.</p></div></div>
