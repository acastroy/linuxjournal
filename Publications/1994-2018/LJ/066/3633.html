off in a dungeon (or if your friends just think so), have a look at
some of these classic console character-based role-playing games
available for Linux. Have you ever wanted to be an @? Well, now you
can, and as an @, you can guide yourself through hundreds of layers
of algorithmically generated dungeons, encountering crazy
creatures, mysterious treasures, problematic nymphs and even the
notorious Kobolds, who burst when you strike them! What ever
<span   class="emphasis"><em>am</em></span> I talking about?</p><p><a href="3633f3.jpg" target="_self">Screen Shot</a></p><p>Rogue was the creature that started it all. Written nearly 20
years ago, it was designed to run on &ldquo;dumb terminals&rdquo;, machines
which were connected to mainframes but had no special powers of
their own (such as graphics, for example). The intent was to
produce a character-based adventure game, using the curses library,
which would produce a new adventure every single time instead of
reiterating the same plot over and over. This approach worked and
produced a game which could surprise even its creators. Thus began
a new genre of computer game, and generations of dungeon-crawlers
were spawned.</p><p>Hack was one of the first Rogue-like games, and it introduced
a new component&mdash;pets. You got to have a dog or cat wander about
with you in the dungeon, and this animal was good company. Many
items and new features were added, and the game became popularized
in various formats across several platforms. As a child, I heard
stories of a mysterious game called Hack which was supposedly a
miraculous, ingenious game, vast and complex, like nothing I had
seen before. In those days, stories soared into legends (like the
rumor that Bard's Tale IV had been created but required a Cray
supercomputer) and when I finally got around to Hack on the Amiga,
it was already in another incarnation.</p><p><a href="3633f4.jpg" target="_self">Screen Shot</a></p><p>NetHack, the direct descendant of Hack, is the most famous of
the Rogue-inspired games. It is extraordinarily complex, offering
all sorts of classes, weapons, scrolls, magical rings, potions,
creatures, locations and plots. The idea is that once you have
outspent yourself (and your parents), you're better off seeking
your fortunes underground by retrieving the Amulet of Yendor (well,
so says
<a href="http://www.gnu.org" target="_self">http://www.gnu.org/</a>; the
game text has a different interpretation). Hence, you can become a
Valkyrie (or a Wizard, Samurai, Rogue, Priest, Knight, Healer, Elf,
Caveman, Barbarian, Archeologist or Tourist) and go out questing.
There are dozens of levels which become immensely complicated, and
the game draws on strategic thinking, cleverness and long-term
strategy. NetHack is now available in two graphical versions, one
based on Qt (QtNetHack) and one based on gtk (GnomeHack). These
graphics are excellent and I recommend taking a look. This is a
deep game (smile) which takes some time to get used to, but it's
good fun and since it <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a classic, it is a
good way to expose yourself to hacker culture.</p><p><a href="3633f7.jpg" target="_self">Screen Shot</a></p><p>Moria is a Tolkien-inspired descendant of Rogue, written in
1983 for VAX machines and ported to UNIX in 1987. The point is to
kill the Balrog. Dungeon levels are quite large, taking up several
screens, as opposed to the single-screen dungeon levels found
elsewhere. Hence, it is quite a bit larger than the original Rogue.
Also, it features a town level, in case you want to come up for
air. You can choose from numerous races and classes&mdash;if, for
example, you've always wished to be a Hobbit (or believed you were
one), now's your chance.</p><p>Angband is another Tolkien-inspired game (well, what isn't?)
which was derived from Moria in 1990. The idea is to descend into a
very deep dungeon and kill Morgoth, the Dark Enemy of Middle-Earth.
The atmosphere is more serious than that of NetHack, so if the
persistent humor and silliness of NetHack end up spoiling the fun
for you, Angband is a good alternative. A developmental,
multi-player version is also available.</p><p>ADOM, Ancient Domains of Mystery, is yet one more Rogue-like
game which differs a bit from the others and offers much more in
some areas. It has many different character classes, and the
magical characters are especially interesting. A commercial version
is planned, as well as a real paper-and-pen RPG (role playing
game). ADOM is still version 0.9.9, but seems to have a large
following especially among teenagers and players under age 10. It
is being actively developed&mdash;the author doesn't seem to have run
out of energy so far.</p><p>CrossFire is a different kind of game from the rest of these
dungeon crawlers. The Linux Game Tome
(<a href="http://happypenguin.org" target="_self">http://happypenguin.org/</a>)
describes it as a cross between NetHack and Gauntlet, and that's
actually fairly accurate. The game is graphical, multi-player (!)
and immense. With over 150 different monsters, about 3000 maps, 19
character classes, about 65 different weapons, dozens of armours,
helmets, shields and clothings, and 18 levels of magic available to
wizards (with roughly 85 spells at last count), CrossFire is a
whole different world in which you and your friends can live. Any
number of people can have clients (even available for Java and
Win32), but the server has to run on a UNIX-based system such as
Linux. If you're tired of being an @ and want to be an animated
graphic again, here's where you can do it!</p><p>&mdash;Jason Kroll</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x181d580.0x1915e48"></a><i  >LJ</i> INDEX&mdash;October,

That was Alan Turing's famous test
of computer intelligence, first published in 1950. Essentially, a

when it answers questions in a way that is fully human&mdash;that is,
indistinguishable from answers given by a human being.</p><p>The search-engine business lives entirely outside Turing's
shadow. Stupid answers are just not a problem&mdash;they're a standard.
The more, the better. Case in point: the very popular and

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x181d580.0x1e9fd80"></a>WILL YOU BE CRACKED NEXT?</h2></div></div><p>Melissa&mdash;Explore.zip&mdash;Back Orifice. If you think there has
been a bad rash of viruses and crack attacks lately, you're right.
And security experts say it's going to get worse, not better; the
frequency of crack attacks is rising exponentially. So are the
money losses from the problem. Computer Economics, a research firm
in Carlsbad, NM, reports that American businesses lost $7.6 billion
US due to software viruses during the first half of 1999&mdash;more than
in all of 1998.</p><p>Curiously, the massive mainstream media coverage of these
incidents completely fails to mention the one thing they all have
in common: Microsoft Windows. Non-Microsoft operating systems such
as Linux are invulnerable to macro attacks, immune to viruses, and
can laugh at Back Orifice.</p><p>This simple fact explains why your Internet service provider
never suffers from viruses; essentially all ISPs run their services
off UNIX boxes, and about 40% of them run Linux. Evidently,
businesses are finding this an increasingly attractive option; a
recent Computer Associates survey reports that 49% of information
technology managers describe Linux as &ldquo;important or essential&rdquo; in
their enterprise plans.</p><p>One of the reasons for this trend is definitely security.
Anyone running a Microsoft operating system on a machine visible
from the Internet is just begging to be cracked. If you're
concerned with computer security, you need to understand why&mdash;and
why Microsoft will not and cannot fix the problem.</p><p>Linux and other operating systems like it were designed from
the ground up to be used by several people on the same machine, and
to protect those people from each other. The user interface of
Linux is separated from the kernel, the privileged operating system
core. And the kernel is carefully protected from being modified by
ordinary programs. This is why Linux doesn't get viruses.</p><p>Microsoft Windows, on the other hand, has a
one-person-per-machine assumption built deeply into it. There is no
internal security, and the Windows kernel is not protected against
being modified by user programs. In fact, the user interface of
Windows is wired right into the kernel. This is why hostile
programs coming in over an Internet connection (such as Back
Orifice) can reach right through the user interface, deep into the
operating system core, and infect it.</p><p>If you value your data and your privacy, you need to
understand that Microsoft cannot fix this security hole. Too many
applications (including Microsoft Office and the IIS web server)
actually <span   class="emphasis"><em>depend</em></span> on the lack of security in the
system. Furthermore, the fact that the source code for Windows is
closed means it never gets properly audited for security
problems.</p><p>How does Microsoft deal with this? Not well. Mainly, they
tell lies and try to confuse the issue.</p><p>On August 3, 1999, Microsoft put a machine running a beta of
its new Windows 2000 operating system on the 'net and challenged
crackers the world over to break into it. A few hours after the
announcement, the machine crashed. Microsoft spokespeople
subsequently claimed that it had been brought down by electrical
storms.</p><p>But the machine's own error logs showed there had been nine
crashes due to errors in Microsoft's own software, not the weather.
Furthermore, crackers did indeed get in and alter a guest book
application during the short time the machine was actually up&mdash;a
fact Microsoft tried to dismiss as irrelevant.</p><p>A few hours after Microsoft's challenge was announced, a
Linux company in Wisconsin matched it. During the following three
days, their Linux machine withstood 6,755 attacks without crashing
once.</p><p>Which system would <span   class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> rather trust your
critical data to?</p><p>&mdash;Eric S. Raymond</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x181d580.0x1ea0358"></a>Flattery (Venus or Hedwig?)</h2></div></div><p>Linux Mandrake 6.0 is out. I received it twice in the mail,
so I know. I also put it on a partition of a VArStation to check it
out. That's when the d&eacute;j&agrave; vu came. I knew I had seen
that screen before, &ldquo;Welcome to Linux Mandrake&rdquo;. Yes, dozens of
times, only I seem to remember the phrase was &ldquo;Welcome to Red Hat
Linux&rdquo;.</p><p>Linux Mandrake, you see, is based on Red Hat. It has a newer
kernel, runs a well-configured KDE instead of GNOME, professes to
be optimized for Pentium family processors, includes the usual
Netscape, StarOffice 5.1 (the new version) and Corel Wordperfect,
but at this stage it's still more a derivative of Red Hat than a
totally independent distribution, at least so far.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3633mf1.jpg"></div>
</p><p>One thing I discovered, though, is that Red Hat
<span   class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> successfully probe hardware. In fact, on
the VArStation, Mandrake's installer (which is Red Hat's installer
with the title changed) probed <span   class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span>,
which is a big improvement from E machines where Red Hat found
nothing but the mouse. Even my home computer was never Red Hat
probe-able, but then again, it's nearly a century old in computer
years. The point is that when choosing between a VArStation, an E
machine, and a &ldquo;computer&rdquo; from 1996, go with a VAr. Still, how do
you decide between Mandrake and Red Hat?</p><p>Many people insist that Mandrake is better than Red Hat.
Mandrake does come out later (by necessity), so it
<span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> more current. It also runs KDE, which seems
to be winning the desktop's favor, and its configuration is pretty
nice. It has more menu entries than I recall in Red Hat, and more
useful links on the desktop (such as XKill). Mandrake also has some
kind of automated online software upgrade function which seems to
work&mdash;it would be so very Red Hat to have something like that.
Mandrake also includes 5 CD-ROMs (though with less software than
SuSE) and 100 days of e-mail support. (Well, phone support is a bit
too social for us computer types anyway). And, it costs
less.</p><p>Red Hat, even if it is older by an insurmountable couple of
months, does have some points in its favor. For one, it has 700+
pages of documentation compared to Mandrake's concise 189. Also,
Red Hat is apparently competing with Linuxcare in terms of support,
whereas I don't know how Mandrake performs in this area, though
they seem devoted to helping the new user. The Mandrake web site is
full of enthusiasm about supporting new users, and maybe Mandrake,
with its cute magician logo (Blue Hat?) will take an active role in
bringing denizens of other OSes across the mountains to the western
paradise that is Linux.</p><p>Mandrake is such a mysterious, exotic name, one might expect
something a little more intimidating than a distribution for
newbies (maybe Linux for sorcerers and witches or something).
Still, it's a fine distribution, full of energy, with a following,
and it's a bit funny (though maybe not intentionally), if you go
for that. Linux Mandrake, based on Red Hat, copied Debian's login
penguin, uses a blue hat for its logo, the BeOS color scheme in
KDE, and named the distribution Venus (that's almost as good as
naming a computer Amiga and then naming its chips after the
developers' girlfriends). I hope Red Hat responds by naming their
next distribution Aphrodite; when I make my distribution which has
snakes growing out of the monitor, I'm going to name it... Well, in
any event, Linux Mandrake does a good job of introducing Linux
neophytes to elements of a few distributions. It may be among the
better ones out there, especially for beginners.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x181d580.0x1ea0880"></a>Stupid Programming Tricks&mdash;&gt;Console Graphics</h2></div></div><p>Many people are bored with the console. &ldquo;It's just text!
Console games are stupid!&rdquo;, they often announce. However, many
games are available for Linux which take advantage of console
graphics. They use the entire screen, don't require X and don't
have silly borders and buttons all around them. Console graphics
are fun, fast, and much easier than graphics in X.</p><p>The established Linux console graphics library is svgalib,
with its sidekick vgagl. Svgalib is a low-level graphics library,
and vgagl is a <span   class="emphasis"><em>fast</em></span>, frame-buffer-level
graphics library for use with svgalib, containing many drawing,
text, bitmap, screen buffering, palette handling and 3-D functions.
Using these two libraries in conjuction makes programming graphics
for Linux exceedingly easy, and both are included in practically
all Linux distributions. Although svgalib doesn't work on some
cards, needs root privileges to run, and may require an
<span   class="emphasis"><em>immediate</em></span> reboot or even crash the machine if
things go wrong, it usually works and it lets us do much more than
X.</p><p>Here's a small example of how to get started. Next month,
we'll move on to things which look impressive but are just as easy.
The full details of svgalib and vgagl can be found with
<b  >man&nbsp;svgalib</b> and
<b  >man&nbsp;vgagl</b>. In case you're interested in a
particular function, its man page should be available too; for
example, <b  >man&nbsp;vga_waitretrace</b>. If svgalib
doesn't work, install the newest version which supports the new
graphics cards. This example opens a graphics screen of 320x200 in
256 colors, draws some shapes, and waits for a key press before
exiting. I recommend compiling with this
command:<b  >gcc&nbsp;-Wall&nbsp;-O2&nbsp;shapes.c&nbsp;-lvgagl&nbsp;-lvga&nbsp;-o&nbsp;shapes</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
#include &lt;vga.h&gt;

(which drew respondents from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Slashdot</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Today</em></span>) showed a high degree (72.3%) of
interest in Rapid Application Development (RAD) and Integrated

Borland/Inprise specialty. In fact, the top answer to &ldquo;Which
language are you primarily interested in developing in on Linux?&rdquo;
was Inprise's own Delphi (43.9%). The first Inprise product for

offerings) are on the horizon. We are sure to see one from VA Linux
Systems and Andover.net. In addition, don't be surprised to see
IPOs from other Linux players over the next year.</p><p>As most of us are computer gurus, not stock market gurus, I
thought it appropriate to find out how an OpenIPO works. I asked
Michael Ackrell of WR Hambrecht + Co to explain it. Here are his
responses to my questions.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Q</b></span>: What is OpenIPO?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>A</b></span>: WR Hambrecht + Co, the
new investment bank founded by industry veteran Bill Hambrecht,
uses a Dutch Auction method, dubbed OpenIPO, to price and allocate
shares in an IPO. Under the auction, orders are received for shares
at various price levels. At the end of the auction, orders are
accepted starting with the highest bid price and continuing at the
lower prices until the number of shares being offered has been
sold. Each investor pays the lowest price accepted, or the clearing
price. In addition, investors bidding above the clearing price will
receive full allocation at that price. Investors bidding at the
clearing price will receive pro-rata allocation. Investors who bid
below the clearing price will not be allocated shares. For example,
a company files a 2 million-share IPO with a filing range of
$12-15. Orders are received as follows: 1 million shares at $18;
500,000 shares at $16; 750,000 shares at $15; 500,000 shares at
$14; and 500,000 shares at $13. For this offering, the clearing
price is $15. Investors who bid above $15 receive full allocation;
investors who bid at $15 receive pro-rata allocation; and investors
who bid below $15 receive no allocation.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Q</b></span>: What are the advantages
of an OpenIPO over the traditional approach?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>A</b></span>: OpenIPO, as the name
implies, is open to any investor, including large institutions, the
over 1,400 small- to medium-sized institutions, and the significant
number of retail investors. Institutional investors like the system
because they are able to receive the full amount of shares they
want, if they bid appropriately. Retail investors like the system
because it provides them access to IPO shares, and their orders
count the same as those from institutions. Issuers benefit from the
system because their stock is available to a much wider group of
potential investors. Furthermore, the auction attempts to establish
a more efficient pricing environment, one that captures the true
demand for a stock in the IPO price rather than in the
aftermarket.</p><p>Ultimately, through OpenIPO, the market, not the underwriter,
prices the IPO. While the system will not alleviate all aftermarket
price fluctuations, it should put more money into the hands of the
issuer.</p><p>For the Open Source community, OpenIPO is a way for
developers to actually receive shares in an IPO. Under the
traditional approach, they would not be able to get any shares.
OpenIPO provides better pricing for the issuer and better
allocation of stock. Red Hat left a lot of money on the table, as
the price rose significantly on its first day of trading and it was
unable to get stock into the hands of its developers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x181d580.0x1ea4b68"></a>Vendor News</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Cygnus Solutions</b></span> announced
