&ldquo;MP3 Linux Players&rdquo; by Craig Knudsen. It seemed to imply the
Empeg product was the only solution for MP3 players in cars. I
would like to suggest braver readers take a look at
<a href="http://www.mp3car.com" target="_self">http://www.mp3car.com/</a>.
The site has great examples and links on how to build one yourself.
Thanks.</p><p>&mdash;Alistair Hedge ahedge@skylink.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ec580.0x15e4298"></a>Neural Networks</h2></div></div><p>Great article! Thanks for printing &ldquo;Stuttgart Neural Network
Simulator&rdquo; by Ed Petron, July 1999. I have been working with
neural networks for two years now in my high school science fair
projects. This article provided a good introduction that I would
have loved to have had handy when I first started working with
neural networks. I really enjoy seeing Linux being used not only as
an alternative OS, but as an OS with scientific and educational
purposes.</p><p>&mdash;Michael Katz-Hymanm katzhym@nhgs.tec.va.us</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ec580.0x15e43f8"></a>Free Beer</h2></div></div><p>The first thing I did after reading the Guest Editorial
entitled &ldquo;The Point Really is Free Beer&rdquo; was to check the cover
date on the magazine to see if it was an April Fool's joke&mdash;sadly,
the issue date was July 1999.</p><p>People like Eric Hughes lead the Open Source movement in the
same way that the front bumper on my truck leads me down the
highway: it's along for the ride, but it really has nothing to do
with who's driving the machine or how we get where we are
going.</p><p>He states that &ldquo;To be generous, maybe one-quarter of the
total value of software comes from the product.&rdquo; To see what a lie
that statement is&mdash;it is only necessary to imagine his proposed
institution <span   class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span> the software. What value
does it have? The answer is <span   class="emphasis"><em>zero</em></span>. All of the
well-dressed staff, administrators and planners are of no value
whatsoever without the people who produce the product.</p><p>The converse is not true; programmers like Linus and the
other open-source developers have great value to all of humanity
without the participation of institutionalized parasites in the
process.</p><p>Mr. Hughes points out that most of the work so far has gone
into building software tools. Well, duh&mdash;first you build
tools&mdash;then you use those tools to build applications. You can't do
it any other way.</p><p>Mr. Hughes has the audacity to accuse those of us who write
open-source code of having selfish ends. Wow! What about Mr.
Hughes' goals? Assume that two-thirds of the 25 million dollar
grant he wants to get the ball rolling would go to &ldquo;the talent&rdquo;.
That leaves about 8.3 million. Building construction and furnishing
will eat up most of that: can't look chintsy&mdash;have to look solid to
impress the idiots.</p><p>That will leave about one million for staff salaries. Since I
assume Mr. Hughes will be willing to <span   class="emphasis"><em>lead</em></span> us,
I guess his take will be about five hundred thousand a year, with
the rest to be split up among the other drones at the institution.
Bah.</p><p>Instead of giving grants to useless institutions or to groups
of programmers, why not give the whole thing to the individuals who
do the work? I can promise you my needs are awfully small compared
to some institutionalized thief. Fifteen hundred a month would keep
me writing open source pretty much full-time. It is about time the
worker bees realize they are the ones with the sting&mdash;not the
drones.</p><p>One hundred per cent of the value of software comes from the
product. Period&mdash;end of discussion.</p><p>&mdash;Bob Canup rcanup@hal-pc.org</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ec580.0x15e4920"></a>Linux Resources</h2></div></div><p>I was chatting with someone and mentioned that
<i  >Linux Journal</i> was just full of advertisers
with affordable Alpha systems, and sent him to you. He couldn't
find a list of your advertisers. Sounds like a business opportunity
to me. List hardware vendors and software vendors. Let me search
for vendors by name and by product. Then I could choose to buy from
your advertisers, or I could find one that sells what I am about to
buy and patronize them.</p><p>Thanks for doing everything else right. The guy I was talking
to will probably be subscribing now. I gave him four links to Alpha
vendors on the Web right out of the handiest issue. (Then I quoted
the rates, and he replied, &ldquo;cheap&rdquo;.)</p><p>&mdash;Duane Smecker telmer@ptw.com</p><p>A list of advertisers in each issue can be found on the web
site Table of Contents page for each. This list includes links to
the advertisers' web sites &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ec580.0x15e4b88"></a>Linux Install on Laptops</h2></div></div><p>I was inspired by the informative article in July's issue by
Daniel Graves, in which he described the installation of Linux on
an IBM Thinkpad 750. Several months ago, I purchased a Sony VAIO
505 mainly driven by the form and weight factor. One of my first
tasks with the machine was to install Linux on it. I have made the
chronicle of the task available at
<a href="http://www.seanet.com/~scout/linux505.htm" target="_self">www.seanet.com/~scout/linux505.htm</a>
for anyone who is interested. I appreciate your publication, as it
provides a good balance of topic breadth and depth each
month.</p><p>&mdash;Ted Ipsen scout@seanet.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ec580.0x15e4d40"></a>BTS</h2></div></div><p>Concerning Red Hat 4.2/5.0/5.1/5.2 and Debian 2.0/2.1....
Both Red Hat and Debian used to support libg++-devel, which
included some very useful C++ templates. Available documentation at
www.debian.org says that libg++-devel will no longer be supported
and that libstdc++-devel contains the functionality.</p><p>This isn't true! If you compare the contents of libg++-devel
and libstdc++-devel, you will notice many files are missing. How
can I build my C++ code on a new Red Hat 5.2 machine without having
to rewrite all those useful libg++-devel templates myself?</p><p>For example, libg++-devel contains g++/String.h, g++/Random.h
and g++/Regex.h, while libstdc++-devel does not. Red Hat used to
ship with libg++-devel, but doesn't as of version 5.2.</p><p>&mdash;Steve Durst sdurst@110.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ec580.0x15e4f50"></a>Floppy Formatting</h2></div></div><p>Occasionally, in &ldquo;Best of Technical Support&rdquo;, someone asks
about formatting floppies from any directory except root, and the
gurus respond that it can't be done. But the following changes work
for me with Red Hat 5.1:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chmod 777 /dev
chmod o+w /dev/fd*
chmod 777 /usr/bin/fdformat
reboot
</pre><p>Since gurus can't be wrong, what am I missing?

subscriber to <i  >LJ</i> for nearly as long. I just
wanted to let you know how much I enjoy your magazine. I learn
something useful in every issue&mdash;from &ldquo;Take Command&rdquo; to &ldquo;At the
Forge&rdquo; and all the others. Despite what I have read in other
letters, I think you are doing a great job of balancing the
advanced, technical subjects with those of the novice, intro
type.</p><p>Last month (#63), I was surprised and delighted to see Linux
applied to my old career of archaeology, and this month (#64) I was
surprised and delighted to see the spotlight on Linux in my current
career in the graphic arts industry! Now, if you can find someone
who has successfully integrated Linux and beer-making to write a
short article....</p><p>Keep the great stuff coming!</p><p>&mdash;Mike Edwards medwards@ega.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ec580.0x15e53c8"></a>Standards, Linux Wars, etc.</h2></div></div><p>Troy Davidson (August <i  >LJ</i> letters) has
been watching too many movies. His Highlands war exists only in his
imagination. I've been using Linux for an even shorter time than
Troy has, but have quite a different take on MS vs. Linux.
Comparing Linux with Windows 9x is like comparing seagulls with the
penguin: they are two different birds with different
purposes.</p><p>Linux is a UNIX clone, and UNIX is a multi-user system. It
has important work to do and it is probably not going to expend a
lot of effort looking after <span   class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span>. It has many
of &ldquo;you&rdquo; to look after; so probably, it won't treat you like your
nanny, which is precisely what MS Windows sets out to do. Linux in
its present form is not for the casual user; it is for the person
who wants to master the system in the way that only the
availability of source code can provide, and there are many such
people out here.</p><p>Nobody remains a beginner. As you gain experience, the
user-friendly &ldquo;features&rdquo; of MS Windows become obstacles. Then you
look for a better place to work. It's waiting for you&mdash;it's called
Linux.</p><p>Linux is not ready to take over the desktop, but the server
war is over and Windows NT is not the winner. (We have two local
ISPs; one on NT, one on Linux. So I have personal experience
regarding which one holds up better.) There is no mystery as to why
the bedrock under the Internet is UNIX, Linux and FreeBSD. They got
there first and offer the most. NT has a following in business
intranets&mdash;the suits tend to stick together.</p><p>Richard Stallman's world of free software is going to
prevail, and for a very simple reason: free access to source is
going to create an abundance of local experts. When the casual user
discovers that one local expert is worth 1000 e-mails to MS
support, then Linux will begin to take over the desktop. MS will
always have a market; someone has to look after the
beginners.</p><p>Let us not call for &ldquo;standards&rdquo;. We don't need standards.
We need more of the same creative anarchy that has got us to where
we are. Spend more time reading code, Troy, and less time watching
movies.</p><p>&mdash;Jack Dennon jdennon@seasurf.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ec580.0x15e5790"></a>Helius Review</h2></div></div><p>It was fun to read the review for the Helius DirectPC router.
However, you could have tested the download speed easily. I had the
same problem with my ADSL connection&mdash;frequently, the Web at large
would be the bottleneck. To get a better idea of what your real
pipe to the Internet is, set up multiple downloads from multiple
sites. Sum the throughput of the varied connections, and you'll get
an idea of what your incoming connection can support.</p><p>&mdash;Michael Rasmussen mikeraz@barley.patch.com</p></div></div>
