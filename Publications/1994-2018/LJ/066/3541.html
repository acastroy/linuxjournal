about two things: what Python is and my background. Python is an
object-oriented, interpreted programming language suitable for
scripting tasks as well as serious programming projects. I see
Python as the interpreted language for those who expect to be able
to go back and understand their program a year after they have
written it.</p><p>Now, about me. You may know me as a magazine publisher, but I
am truly just a geek who found a way to make less money. I have
been writing in assembly language and FORTRAN since the '60s, and
in more UNIX-like languages such as C and AWK since 1980. I have
seriously used at least a dozen languages and am generally very
comfortable around most anything except Cobol.</p><p>What I am not is an object-oriented programmer. I understand
the concepts, but have never worked in an object-oriented language
such as C++ or Modula.</p><p>Python is interpreted like Perl or awk, but it is
object-oriented. I was ready to give it a try. The problem is that
I am not a full-time programmer, because I have this publishing job
to do, but many times I do end up writing code.</p><p>Armed with O'Reilly's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming
Python</em></span>, I was off to become a Python expert. Well, to
make a short story shorter, it didn't work. While it is a good book
to use as a reference or to take with you to a desert isle along
with your Python-equipped laptop, it wasn't the book for a
part-time programmer with over 30 years of non-OOP experience to
use.</p><p>Enter <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning Python</em></span>. My executive
summary is that this is the right book for me and probably for many
others as well. While <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning Python</em></span> doesn't
tell you everything, it is a good 366 pages that will get you up
and running. Written in a textbook style with examples and
exercises, it introduces both object-oriented programming and the
Python language.</p><p>Both authors have done Python training, and it shows.
Examples appear where you need them, and the exercises actually
test your understanding of important concepts. This is a book to
read with a computer nearby. You will learn a great deal from the
exercises.</p><p>The book is divided into three parts. The first part covers
the core of the Python language, explaining types and operators,
basic statements, functions, modules, classes and exceptions. Part
two moves you out a little into Python's built-in tools, common
tasks and finally how to build real programs. Part three covers
Python resources on the Net, platform specifics and answers to the
exercises.</p><p>I have been very thorough in going through this book (because
I actually want to add Python to my language set), and have found
the book to be extremely accurate. The examples all work and you
won't be misled by the text&mdash;a problem far too common for first
printings of technical books.</p><p>Who, besides me, should get this book? I would say anyone who
is comfortable with computers and wants to learn a very cool
object-oriented language. By &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo;, knowing one
programming language or at least a scripting language is going to
help a lot. While the book covers the basics, if expressions like
&ldquo;dynamic typing&rdquo; or &ldquo;syntax rules&rdquo; scare you, then you may need
to get a little more comfortable before attempting to learn a real
programming language.</p></div></div>
