    Web site monitoring of your system can be easy using Linux
    and Perl.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a8580.0x27a03f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Many users of Linux are initially
attracted to the platform for its powerful web server capabilities.
Developing a web site on the Linux platform is a very satisfying
experience. After the fun of designing and developing the site is
over, it moves to production. Once in production, a web site
typically has uptime requirements; to ensure these are met, the
site must be monitored. I use a monitoring system that requests
pages from a number of web sites, several times a day. If any
server does not serve a web page, it is retried. If again there is
no response, I am alerted via pager. Using this system, I can
respond to an outage even before a user can report a problem. It
takes only a little Perl and Linux to make this happen.
</p><p>Linux and Perl were the obvious choices for a web server
monitoring and alerting facility. Linux provides the stability and
flexibility in the platform, and Perl, using the LWP bundle of
modules (also known as libwww), provides an excellent means to work
with HTTP requests.</p><p>I will explain how to compile/install the components needed,
how to create a simple Perl script that will &ldquo;HTTP ping&rdquo; a server
(HTTPping.pl), how to send a page to a pager using Perl, and how to
glue it all together into an industrial-strength web site
monitoring solution (Monitor.pl).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a8580.0x27a05b0"></a>LWP</h2></div></div><p>The wide availability of modules that extend Perl's
functionality is one of the language's strong suits. In the case of
fetching web pages, there are several modules that could be used.
LWP is the clear choice, because it is a fantastic set of modules
giving Perl powerful control over HTTP and HTML. Before you can
begin exploring LWP and how you can use it to monitor a web site,
you must install it.</p><p><a href="3531t1.html" target="_self">Table 1.</a></p><p>The LWP modules depend on several other modules. These may
not be installed on your system. If not, they must be downloaded
and installed. Table 1 contains the exact version I installed, in
the order I installed them. Except for SSLeay (more on that later),
you can download all these packages from CPAN (Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network). If you are new to Perl, it would be a good idea
to browse around CPAN for a bit. It contains an enormous number of
support modules for Perl that can save a lot of programming time
and costs.</p><p>Once you have downloaded the tar.gz files, they must be
expanded using the <span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span>
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -zxvpf MIME-Base64-2.11.tar.gz
</pre><p>This will uncompress and unpack the package. Do this for all
archives. When finished, you will have a directory full of the
original archives and a new folder for each archive. Each folder
contains the module's installer; run the installer for each
package. Again, using the MIME::Base64 module as the example,
change (using <span   class="bold"><b>cd</b></span>) to the
HTML-Parser-2.22 directory and type the following commands:
<pre     class="programlisting">
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
</pre>


This is the typical way of installing Perl modules. However,
packages vary, and you should always read the README or INSTALL
file and other documentation that comes with any module.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a8580.0x27a09d0"></a>SSLeay</h2></div></div><p>If you plan to HTTP ping servers that use SSL (secure sockets
layer), you must compile and install SSLeay and Crypt-SSLeay.
SSLeay is a set of programs that provides the cryptographic
routines needed for SSL. Crypt-SSLeay is the Perl module that
serves as a wrapper for SSLeay. I suggest you read the
documentation that comes with SSLeay. It will help especially if
you run into any problems when compiling.</p><p>Execute the following commands in the directory to which you
uncompressed the SSLeay-0.6.6b.tar.gz archive to install
SSLeay:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
./Configure linux-elf
make depend
make
make rehash
make test
make install
</pre><p>Three important things about SSLeay are:
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Don't try to use the newer versions of SSLeay. They
will not work with Crypt-SSleay and the LWP bundle. The last stable
version is SSLeay-0.6.6b.tar.gz.</p></li><li><p>Second, SSLeay leaks memory. If you choose to use
SSLeay and LWP to repeatedly HTTP ping a site that uses SSL, you
will probably experience some problems with memory leaks. By
calling HTTPping.pl from Monitor.pl, the script executes, pinging
the site once, then terminates; this reduces the potential for a
memory leak to accumulate, thereby causing your application to
crash.</p></li><li><p>Since SSLeay uses RSA, you should read the SSLeay
FAQ (see references) to determine if you can legally use SSLeay and
if you need a license from RSA.</p></li></ol></div>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a8580.0x27a0e48"></a>Creating an HTTP Ping Utility</h2></div></div><p>HTTPPing.pl sends a HEAD request to the web server to be
monitored. The server responds by sending only the HTTP headers. If
you are testing only if the server is up, this is all you need to
know. It is a good idea to understand the basic HTTP methods, GET,
POST and HEAD, when beginning web-client programming. To see how
the HEAD command works, we can emulate a browser using
<span   class="bold"><b>telnet</b></span>. I have a web server
running on the machine that I use for development. If you do not
have a server running on your local machine, replace
<b  >localhost</b> with the name of a production web
server.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ telnet www.cpan.org
80Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
</pre><p>Type the following, then press &ldquo;enter&rdquo; twice:
<pre     class="programlisting">
HEAD / HTTP/1.0
</pre>


This is the output returned by my server.
<pre     class="programlisting">

This block of text contains the HTTP headers for the requested
file. It can be automated using Perl and LWP as shown in Listing 1.
</p><p><a href="3531l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. HTTPPing.pl</a></p><p>The first line of the script determines which interpreter to
use to run the script. If Perl is in a different location on your
system, you will need to change your script accordingly.
HTTPPing.pl accepts two arguments: the URL to HTTP ping and a debug
flag. These arguments are placed into variables.
<b  >LWP::UserAgent</b> and an
<b  >HTTP::Request</b> objects are created. The Request
is passed to the UserAgent, and a response is returned. The
response is examined to see if the server is up. If the site is up,
the script exits with a status of 1; if not, it exits with a status
of 0. Optionally, determined by the debug parameter, the status of
the site is verbosely stated as &ldquo;up&rdquo; or &ldquo;down&rdquo;.</p><p>To ping a site, enter the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ perl HTTPPing.pl http://localhost/ 1
http://localhost is up.
</pre><p>If you have a site that uses SSL and a user name and
password, you could use:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ perl
HTTPPing.pl https://username:password@localhost/ 1
https://username:password@localhost/ is up.
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a8580.0x27a1478"></a>Creating the Paging Subroutine</h2></div></div><p>Now that you can HTTP ping your site, let's see how to send
the alert page. Once that is accomplished, you can tie HTTPPing.pl
and the SendPage subroutine together by calling them both from a
Perl script running as a service.</p><p>Several options are available for sending a page from a Perl
script: the Simple Network Paging Protocol (SNPP), TAP (telocator
alphanumeric protocol) and proprietary paging interfaces. Many
pager services allow SNPP access. Also, a Perl module, Net::SNPP,
can make sending a page very simple.</p><p>My paging service provides a web-based paging interface. It
is an HTML form which collects the recipient's pager PIN and the
message, and puts (POST) that information in a CGI script at my
paging service provider. Since this is a web-based interface, LWP
is a natural for the job. The form requires three values to be
posted: the command type, the PIN and the message. The command type
is constant for sending pages to my type of pager; the other two
values are passed in as arguments.</p><p><a href="3531l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. SendPage Subroutine using Skytel Web Site</a></p><p>Note that the request object allows you to create a POST
request as well as the already familiar HEAD request. This
subroutine is the one I use in my Monitor.pl script. Most paging
service providers have web-based paging services (see
Resources).</p><p>Alternately, if your paging service provider gives you access
to an SNPP server, consider using that protocol. Part of the libnet
bundle is the Net::SNPP module. It is a great tool for sending
pages using the SNPP (RFC 1861). It also has the appeal of being
open-standards-based. However, some SNPP servers are so slow that
many times, the above method will be superior. Using the Net::SNPP
module to send a page is shown in Listing 3.</p><p><a href="3531l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. SendPage Subroutine for SNPP Servers</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a8580.0x27a1840"></a>Tying It Together</h2></div></div><p>Integrate HTTPPing.pl and whichever SendPage routine you
chose. Monitor.pl repeatedly calls the HTTPPing.pl script at
regular intervals. If HTTPPing.pl detects that the site is down, it
retries the site to verify. If the site is verified as down, a page
is sent. After sending the page, Monitor.pl continues to send HTTP
pings to the site. When the site comes back up, another page is
sent.</p><p><a href="3531l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. Monitor.pl</a></p><p>Below is an example of starting Monitor.pl, giving the URL to
ping, the pager pin and the delays as arguments. The last argument
is an optional debug flag that will show you what is going on
inside the script.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
perl Monitor.pl http://localhost 1234567 120 120 1
</pre><p>Once Monitor.pl is started, it will patiently test your site
at an interval you choose for as long as you like. It is a good
idea to start such a script during system boot.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a8580.0x27a1b00"></a>Starting Monitor.pl at System Boot</h2></div></div><p>Copy HTTPPing.pl and Monitor.pl to the /bin directory, and
change their permissions to make them executable. This permits them
to be run by the system at system boot.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chmod +x Monitor.pl
chmod +x HTTPping.pl
</pre><p>You can start the Monitor.pl script when your system boots by
taking advantage of a special script that is run every time your
system boots. The /etc/rc.d/rc.local script is run by the system
after all services have been started. By adding the following line
to the end of your rc.local file, the Monitor.pl will be started at
boot time.
<pre     class="programlisting">
Monitor.pl http://localhost 1234567 120 120 0 &amp;
</pre>


Then use a tool such as <span   class="bold"><b>tksysv</b></span> to
add it to the run levels you want it to start in. On my system, I
boot to run level 3, so I added it to the list of the programs to
start in run level 3. This makes the monitoring station even more
robust by enabling the monitoring scripts to start up at boot time.
See <i  >Linux Journal</i> issue 55 for a good
introduction to init and services.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a8580.0x2b9a010"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The solid server performance of Linux and the rich and
easy-to-use features of the LWP bundle and Perl would make it very
easy to extend HTTPPing.pl and Monitor.pl to perform more complex
web server checks. You could handle cookies and perform simulated
user input into forms periodically to test applications. The
possibilities of HTTP client programming are limitless with the LWP
modules.</p><p><a href="3531s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
