complete, pre-installed Linux systems based on Caldera OpenLinux
2.2. The systems arrive completely configured for all hardware and
even the X Window System, and are available in a variety of
configurations based on different processors and hardware
components. The systems include everything one expects in a
computer, including keyboard, mouse, shielded speakers, the
computer itself and a bunch of mysterious manuals, screws and
bubble wrap (tension sheets?)--the typical things that come with
computers, some of which we never figure out how to use (for
example, the free Windows software that comes with your Linux box).
</p><p>The real question is, what's the very best thing about this
computer? It's turquoise. Actually, the particular machine NexTrend
sent to our product testing lab has a Pentium III 500MHz CPU, an
8.4GB drive and 128MB of RAM, which are also nice. To be honest,
this machine is actually quite loaded. Still, if you order one, you
can have more or less any configuration, as far as I know. The true
question, aside from the color, is how well the Linux system
operates.</p><p>It looks like a Macintosh, but we all knew that about
turquoise-colored machines running KDE. Still, what with the color
of the machine (perhaps more accurately described as teal), it
feels particularly inviting, on top of which Caldera OpenLinux 2.2
is a tight, clean distribution which includes a lot of productivity
software preconfigured into the menuing system (such as Netscape,
WordPerfect 8.0 and Star Office 5). COAS (Caldera Open
Administration System) is a small, fast program for dealing with
things ranging from system administration to machine-specific
hardware configuration, and even includes a loader for kernel
modules. Taken on the whole, Caldera OpenLinux 2.2 fits very nicely
on the home desktop computer, and while it is known as &ldquo;Linux for
Business&rdquo;, the important point is it works, is easy to use and
comes with a lot of software, though still no
<span   class="bold"><b>pico</b></span>.</p><p>Although Caldera has about the easiest installer going, one
way around the alleged difficulty of Linux installation is to buy a
pre-installed system. The NexStar system is completely configured,
with an optimal kernel and dozens of modules. Everything works on
this machine, from the XF86Config file, to the Sound Blaster 64AWE
card, the 56K modem, the Intel 8460B Ethernet card, the 48X speed
CD-ROM drive, the Iomega ZIP drive (though this is not
pre-configured into fstab), the floppy drive, the 8.4GB hard drive
(okay, if this didn't work, there'd be a problem), the ATI AGP 8MB
video card, etc. XF86Config is ideally configured for the optional
CyberVision monitor in both 800x600 (84Hz) and 1024x768 (70Hz)
modes (I added a nice 1152x864 mode at 69Hz), though libvga.config
is not configured (just copy data from XF86Config). The video
timings are more or less perfectly matched to the monitor, and when
the system is up and running, it's quite neat. However, it
<span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> possible to make a mess of things.</p><p>The one annoyance in OpenLinux 2.2 is that once you have
&ldquo;shutdown&rdquo; KDE to console mode, you cannot get it up again.
<span   class="bold"><b>startx</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>kde</b></span> just start up a bare X screen
and the client has authority issues connecting to the server, so
all you get to do is move an X over a test pattern. Typing
<b  >telinit 5</b> won't solve this problem, but you can
reboot or else just remember not to shut down KDE. The remedy, an
update of XFree86, is available on Caldera's web site. OpenLinux
2.2 has the feel one expects of a professional Linux system, and
COAS is truly neat. While hackers often like Slackware, and SuSE,
Debian GNU/Linux, and the ubiquitous Red Hat are also superb
choices, Caldera OpenLinux 2.2 is ideal for the user who wants a
pre-installed system&mdash;it has a <span   class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of software
organized neatly into KDE's menus, is a complete system and truly
feels like one. NexTrend's selection of OpenLinux is a point to
consider when deciding which Linux PC maker to choose, if for
example you're bored with Red Hat.</p><p>No computer review is complete without some benchmarks, but
we haven't finished our custom benchmark software, so it's time for
benchmark trivia. The <b  >cat /proc/cpuinfo</b> command
reports 498.07 bogomips; the Crafty chess engine evaluates about
190,000 positions per second;
<span   class="bold"><b>bonnie</b></span> reports block writing at
21533KB/sec and block input at 14684KB/sec, and BYTEmark evaluates
the system to have a memory index of 2.082, an integer index of
1.794, and a floating-point index of 4.603 (compared to AMDK6/233).
It took 3.5 minutes to <b  >make&nbsp;bzImage</b> for a
462KB kernel.</p><p>Many machines are out there, so be sure to shop around, and
if you order from NexTrend, make sure they still put Linux boxes in
these cool, teal shells.</p></div></div>
