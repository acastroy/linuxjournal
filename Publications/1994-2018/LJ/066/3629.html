    A continuation of the discussion on creating graphics
    dynamically on the Web.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a32580.0x2b2a450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month, we discussed the different
ways a CGI program can create dynamically generated graphics
output. That is, we wrote several programs in which the program
describes its output not as &ldquo;text/html&rdquo;, but as &ldquo;graphics/gif&rdquo;.
</p><p>This month, we will examine some more tools that allow us to
create graphics dynamically. However, the graphics will have an
additional twist this time, in that they will reflect an individual
user's stock portfolio rather than a global set of data
values.</p><p>As with any non-trivial software project, our first step must
be to create a brief specification. In this particular project, we
will have two major programs. In the first, the user will be able
to create and edit a personal profile, describing the securities he
or she owns. The second program will take the information in the
user's profile and use it to create a personalized graphic stock
portfolio.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a32580.0x2b2a608"></a>Needed Tools</h2></div></div><p>This project brings together a number of tools we have
discussed in previous installments of ATF. Nevertheless, it seems
like a good idea for us to review them, since we are going to call
on so many.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>MySQL</b></span>: MySQL is a small,
inexpensive relational database available for Linux and many other
operating systems. (See &ldquo;Resources&rdquo; for information on where to
get it.) In addition to its low price, MySQL is quite fast and
efficient, which makes it popular on many web sites. As a
relational database, MySQL forces us to store information in one or
more tables, in which each row refers to a separate record. As with
most relational databases, we communicate with MySQL using SQL, a
database query language. We cannot write programs in SQL; rather,
we must embed our queries inside of a program written in a full
programming language. In our case, that language is Perl.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>DBI</b></span>: While SQL might be a
standard query language for communicating with databases, the
software and libraries used to speak with those databases vary
considerably. To talk to an Oracle server, you need Oracle
libraries; to talk to a MySQL server, you need MySQL libraries, and
so forth. As a result, the Perl database world was fractured for a
long time, with special versions for individual databases.</p><p>Now, however, there is a better way: the DBI module
standardized the API to relational databases, meaning that
programmers moving from one database server to another have to
learn only the different nuances of the SQL implementations.
Previously, they had to learn a separate Perl API as well, which
was frustrating. This was accomplished by separating the database
code into two parts, one generic (DBI) and the other specific to
each server (DBD). In order to use DBI, you will need to install
the generic DBI libraries, and then one or more DBDs appropriate
for the products you use.</p><p>There is a problem with DBI and the Web, however, which has
to do with the way in which database servers were designed. In
general, they expect a client program to open a connection, perform
many queries, then disconnect. Opening a connection is thus quite
slow and inefficient. When a CGI program is a database client, it
must open a new database connection for each HTTP transaction. See
the mod_perl section immediately below for one solution to this
problem, Apache::DBI.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl for Apache</b></span>: Web
servers traditionally provided custom and dynamic output by
invoking external programs, using the CGI standard. An HTTP server
would pass information to the CGI program, which would then be
expected to send its output to the user's browser. This output
generally came in the form of HTML-formatted text, but as we saw
last month, it is possible to produce graphics as well.</p><p>However, CGI is quite slow; every invocation of a CGI program
requires a new process to be created. If you are using Perl, each
invocation requires the program to be compiled into Perl's internal
format, then executed.</p><p>An alternative method is to use mod_perl, a module for the
free Apache HTTP server that embeds a fully working version of Perl
inside the server. This has several ramifications, one of which
being the fact that we can now create custom output without having
to rely on external programs.</p><p>When using mod_perl, you can take advantage of a module known
as <span   class="bold"><b>Apache::DBI</b></span>. This module
pretends to work the same as DBI, but actually caches database
handles ($dbh) across invocations. So even when your program thinks
it is opening a new database connection, it is actually reusing a
database handle from a previous invocation.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>GIFgraph</b></span>: The GIFgraph set
of Perl modules allows us to create charts and graphs on the fly,
from within CGI programs or mod_perl modules. We explored a basic
use of GIFgraph last month. As its name implies, GIFgraph produces
output in GIF format. Last month, we saw how to return GIFs
directly to the user's browser. This month, we will instead save
the resulting graphs to individual files, to which we will create
hyperlinks.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Apache::Session</b></span>: HTTP, the
protocol on which the Web is based, was designed to be lightweight
and simple. As part of this consideration, it was also designed to
be &ldquo;stateless&rdquo;, meaning each transaction is independent. This
creates a problem, however, in that you will often want to keep
track of which user is which. For instance, in this application, we
want to ensure we are tracking the correct user's portfolio.
Without state, we cannot track portfolios at all, let alone for
multiple users. Apache::Session, as we will see below, allows us to
get around this by using a database and HTTP cookies to store one
or more pieces of information using a unique identifier.</p><p>With the above five technologies, we can create a fairly
impressive stock portfolio tracker that allows users to define
which securities they own and view their current holdings in
graphical format. As presented this month, the application is
admittedly a bit crude, but it should show you how easy it is to
write such an application and how flexible the above tools can be
in creating one.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a32580.0x2b2ace8"></a>Creating the Database Tables</h2></div></div><p>Before we can begin to work on the applications themselves,
we need to create the underlying database tables they will use. We
will need two different tables: one to hold the individual stock
values on different dates and another to store user personalization
information.</p><p>The first table, called StockValues, has three columns: a
symbol, which can contain up to six characters; a value, which can
range from 0 to 999999.999; and a date. We can create such a table
with the following SQL, most often by using the interactive
<span   class="bold"><b>mysql</b></span> client program that comes
with MySQL:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE StockValues (
   symbol CHAR(6) NOT NULL,
   value NUMERIC(6,3) NOT NULL,
   date DATE NOT NULL
);
</pre><p>Each row in the above table refers to the value of a single
stock on a single day. By storing information like this, we can
easily create charts for a stock during arbitrary periods of time.
For the sake of brevity, our applications will always display all
of the available values for a stock. The above table also gives us
many possibilities for additional applications, such as finding a
stock's high and low values during a given time period.
</p><p>How will StockValues be populated with values? Most
commercial sites retrieve stock information from a commercial
service, using a background process to place the information in a
database table. My budget is more limited than the average business
web site, so I decided to insert some arbitrary values into
StockValues. In order to do this, I used the interactive mysql
client program, and entered several queries of this type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO StockValues (symbol, value, date)
   VALUES ("ZZZZ", 100, "1999-07-14");
</pre><p>The second table we will create is for Apache::Session::DBI,
a version of Apache::Session that allows us to store information
about a particular user in a database table. The table's name and
format are determined by the Apache::Session API:
<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE sessions (
   id char(16),
   length int(11),
   a_session text
);
</pre>


Once we have created this table, we can ignore the fact that
Apache::Session stores its information in a database. So far as we
are concerned, we perform a magic incantation at the beginning of
our code, which retrieves the current session values. We retrieve
the user's session ID by reading an HTTP cookie:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my $id = $r-&gt;header_in('Cookie');
$id =~ s|SESSION_ID=(\w*)|$1|;
</pre>


Then, once we have assigned <b  >$id</b> the value of the
user's session ID, we tie the <b  >%session</b> hash to
the &ldquo;sessions&rdquo; table with the Apache::Session::DBI module:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my %session;
tie %session, 'Apache::Session::DBI', $id,
{
DataSource =&gt; 'dbi:mysql:test:localhost:3306',
UserName   =&gt; '',
Password   =&gt; ''
};
</pre>


From this point on, any name,value pairs stored in
<b  >%session</b> in previous sessions will be available.
By the same token, we can assign
<pre     class="programlisting">
$session{key} = "value";
</pre>


and be sure that in our next invocation, despite HTTP's
statelessness, we can retrieve the same value. Apache::Session thus
makes it possible for us to store arbitrary quantities and types of
information about a user.
</p><p>We will store three session variables for each user. The
e-mail address and name will be stored as scalars, and the user's
current holdings will be stored as a hash reference. The keys to
the <b  >%portfolio</b> hash will be the stock symbols,
and the number of shares owned in that particular security will be
stored as the values.</p><p>When we want to store <b  >%portfolio</b> as part
of the session, we turn it into a reference and store that in
<b  >%session</b> with the key &ldquo;portfolio&rdquo;:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$session{portfolio} = \%portfolio;
</pre><p>A reference is a specially tagged scalar, which allows us to
store it in a hash. We retrieve it later with the following
complicated-looking code:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my %portfolio =
   defined $session{portfolio} ?
   %{$session{portfolio}} : ();
</pre>


The above uses Perl's trinary operator <b  >?:</b> as a
shortcut to &ldquo;if-then&rdquo;. It means that if $session{portfolio} is
defined, then dereference it into its original hash value and
assign it to <b  >%portfolio</b>. If it is undefined,
then assign the empty hash, <b  >()</b>, to
<b  >%portfolio</b>. After this line of code is executed,
<b  >%portfolio</b> will contain the user's current
portfolio. By using Apache::Session, we can maintain the illusion
of state across HTTP transactions, and store many users' portfolios
in our database.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a32580.0x2b2b738"></a>Profile Editor</h2></div></div><p>Now we will write the two applications that will work with
this information. The code for those two applications can be found
in the archive file at
ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue66/3629.tgz. The first will
be StockProfile.pm, a Perl module for mod_perl that will allow
users to create and edit their portfolios and personal
information.</p><p>Since our program will be running as part of mod_perl, we
will need to remember several things. First and foremost, we must
create a new Perl module and package with a subroutine named
&ldquo;handler&rdquo;. We will configure Apache to invoke this &ldquo;handler&rdquo;
subroutine whenever a particular URL is requested from the HTTP
server. Because our subroutine will be part of Apache rather than
invoked in a separate process, and because mod_perl compiles and
caches code that we write, our routine will run much faster than if
it were a CGI program.</p><p>We must also remember to adhere to mod_perl programming
conventions, the most important being to use lexical (&ldquo;temporary&rdquo;
or &ldquo;my&rdquo;) variables as much as possible. Global variables stick
around across invocations of mod_perl, which can lead to memory
leaks and odd bugs. We ensure that we use &ldquo;my&rdquo; before variables
with the <b  >use strict</b> pragma at the top of our
program.</p><p>Our module, Apache::StockProfile.pm (see Listing 1 in the
archive file), has three stages: First, it initializes all of the
variables and information, grabbing the current list of securities
from <b  >StockValues</b> and initializing the user's
profile. Then, if the module was invoked with the
<span   class="bold"><b>POST</b></span> method, it sets or modifies
the user's profile information as necessary. Finally, it produces
an HTML form that can be used to modify the profile further.</p><p>The first thing we do in &ldquo;handler&rdquo;, as with all mod_perl
modules, is retrieve the Apache request object, traditionally known
as <b  >$r</b>. This object's methods allow us to
retrieve and set everything having to do with the HTTP transaction.
For instance, we can set outgoing headers with
<b  >$r-&gt;header_out</b>, the &ldquo;Content-Type&rdquo; header
with <b  >$r-&gt;content_type</b>, and send the final
headers with <b  >$r-&gt;send_http_header</b>.</p><p>However, certain things are more easily accomplished&mdash;at
least to experienced CGI programmers&mdash;with CGI.pm, the standard
module for CGI programming. We can get a version of that API by
using and creating an instance of CGI::Apache. The created object
gives us access to HTML form elements and debugging tools
(including the invaluable <span   class="bold"><b>dump</b></span>
method) using the familiar interface from CGI.pm. Not everything
works in the same way, but it is good enough for almost all
purposes.</p><p>Our main use of CGI::Apache in this program is to retrieve
the HTML form elements, which are submitted via the POST method.
StockProfile.pm both creates the form and handles its submission,
which might seem odd at first but makes for a compact and
easy-to-maintain type of code.</p><p>We retrieve a list of current symbols with a simple SELECT
statement to the database. However, if we were to simply say
&ldquo;SELECT symbol FROM StockValues&rdquo;, we would get one row for each
value of a symbol or about five values per week, if we add one new
value each day. In order to retrieve distinct values, we add the
qualifier <b  >DISTINCT</b> to our SELECT query. We also
ask that the symbols be alphabetized, so that they will be listed
in reasonable order:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $sql = "SELECT DISTINCT symbol FROM StockValues";
$sql .=   "ORDER BY symbol ";
</pre><p>We set the values of <b  >$name</b>,
<b  >$email</b> and <b  >%portfolio</b> based
on the user's session information, as we discussed earlier. We then
use this information to fill in the HTML form that allows the user
to modify his or her profile. I prefer to use a table for such
forms to ensure the columns line up straight, but that is simply a
matter of aesthetics; the important thing is that each element must
have its own, unique name and they will be the same names as our
POST-handling code at the top of the program expects to use.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a32580.0x2b22808"></a>Stock Reporter</h2></div></div><p>Our second mod_perl handler is StockReport.pm (see Listing 2
in the archive). This module uses the portfolio information the
user has entered, and creates one or more graphs based on
it.</p><p>If the user has a portfolio defined, then we iterate through
each of the symbols in it. We then SELECT all of the rows in
StockValues with that symbol, retrieving them in date order:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $sql = "SELECT value,date FROM StockValues ";
$sql .=   "WHERE symbol = \"$symbol\" ";
$sql .=   "ORDER BY date ";
</pre><p>Now we iterate through each of the returned rows, adding the
value to the <b  >@values</b> array and the date to the
<b  >@dates</b> array. We also calculate the value of the
user's holdings on that day (by multiplying the number of shares by
the share price) and put that in the <b  >@holdings</b>
array.
</p><p>We then plot our data set by creating a
<b  >@data</b> array, in which the elements are
references to <b  >@dates</b>, <b  >@values</b>
and <b  >@holdings</b>. <b  >@dates</b> will be
used as the X axis in our graph, while <b  >@values</b>
and <b  >@holdings</b> will be plotted as well. Because
each element of <b  >@holdings</b> is bound to be a
multiple of its counterpart in <b  >@values</b>, we tell
GIFgraph to use two Y axes&mdash;one for values and one for
holdings.</p><p>We create the graphs themselves using GIFgraph's
<span   class="bold"><b>plot_to_gif</b></span> method, which takes a
set of data points (the <b  >@data</b> array,
StockReport.pm), creates a graph in GIF format, then saves it to
disk. We set the filename in a variable, so that we can both save
the file and refer to it in an IMG tag. Remember, the file must be
in the web document tree in order for it to be available to the
user's web browser!</p><p>It might be tempting to put such files in /tmp, the standard
temporary directory for Linux systems, but then the graphics will
be unavailable to outside browsers. This directory must be writable
by the web server, which often means making it open to more people
than the rest of your web hierarchy. If this is the case on your
system, make sure only this directory is writable by others, so
that you don't run the risk of an intruder viewing or damaging your
site's sensitive files.</p><p>Creating files in this way works well, but with one major
flaw: it has the potential to fill your file system with numerous
old graphics. A number of methods can be used to overcome this
problem, but perhaps the simplest is to use
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> to identify and delete any
file older than a certain time. Depending on how busy your site is,
you might want to run such a cron job every ten minutes, every
hour, or once a month. It all depends on how many visitors you
receive and how large your disk is. It is probably better to run
such a deleting program more often, so as to avoid a
denial-of-service attack that could fill your disks.</p><p>While I did not implement it in this version of StockReport,
you can probably see how easy it would be to allow users to choose
the range of dates in the graph. Using an HTML form, you could
allow users to choose the starting and ending dates; the values of
those form elements could then be inserted into the SQL query so as
to SELECT just those rows between the named dates.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a32580.0x2b230f8"></a>Installing the Modules</h2></div></div><p>Once we have written and installed StockProfile.pm and
StockReport.pm into our Perl module hierarchy, we must somehow tell
Apache when to use them. We can do this in a number of ways, but my
preference is to create special URLs that invoke these modules.
That is, every time someone requests the URL &ldquo;/stock-profile&rdquo;
from our server, they should get the profile editor. By the same
token, when someone requests &ldquo;/stock-report&rdquo; from our server,
they should see a report of their current stocks.</p><p>In order to accomplish this, we must first load each of the
modules by adding the following two lines to the Apache
configuration file, httpd.conf:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PerlModule Apache::StockProfile
PerlModule Apache::StockReport
</pre><p>Once we have done that, we can create new URLs, which do not
necessarily correspond with files on the server's file system. For
this, we use <b  >&lt;Location&gt;</b> sections in
httpd.conf. We indicate that the URL in question should be handled
by a Perl module (&ldquo;SetHandler perl-script&rdquo;), and then tell Apache
which specific module to use for that particular URL:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /stock-profile&gt;
   SetHandler perl-script
   PerlHandler Apache::StockProfile
&lt;/Location&gt;
&lt;Location /stock-report&gt;
   SetHandler perl-script
   PerlHandler Apache::StockReport
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>


You will need to restart Apache in order for these new URLs to
work. If there is an error in one of the Perl modules, or if
mod_perl cannot find one of the modules in the module path
<b  >@INC</b>, the restart of Apache will fail. This
ensures you will not have any compile-time errors when your modules
run under mod_perl. At the same time, it requires that you test
your modules extensively before including them on a live site,
since bringing down the server on a large web site can be
embarrassing or financially difficult.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a32580.0x2b23410"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Last month, we saw how to create simple dynamic stock graphs
using the GIFgraph package. This month, we saw how such dynamically
created graphics can fit into a larger application, allowing users
to see information about their stock portfolios. The combination of
a relational database, mod_perl and GIFgraph makes it possible to
create such a simple application in under 400 lines of code. You
can undoubtedly think of many other applications in which
dynamically created graphics would be useful&mdash;let your imagination
go wild!</p><p><a href="3629s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
