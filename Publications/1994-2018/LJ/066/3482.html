    Mr. Knudsen tells us why this company chose to add MS extensions to
    Kaffe, the open-source Java implementation.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc92580.0xd8a3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Kaffe, first released in 1996, was the
original open-source Java implementation. Initially developed as
part of another project, it grew so popular that developers Tim
Wilkinson and Peter Mehlitz founded Transvirtual Technologies, Inc.
with Kaffe as the company's flagship product. In July of 1998,
Transvirtual released Kaffe OpenVM under a GNU license.
</p><p>Kaffe's multi-platform support and small footprint have
attracted many users. On-line magazine JavaWorld gave Kaffe their
Editors' Choice Award for Best Virtual Machine for 1998, stating,
&ldquo;Java has been waiting for Kaffe for a long time. A proper
open-source, cross-platform JVM, free of restrictive licenses, is a
must for the complete acceptance of Java.&rdquo; Kaffe was originally
released as source code long before the term &ldquo;open source&rdquo; had
been coined. It was the first Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for many
operating systems and was also one of the first to offer a
Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for many architectures, improving
Java's runtime performance.</p><p>Microsoft's Java extensions have created a good deal of
controversy. Sun claims that Microsoft violated the terms of its
Java licensing agreement and has filed a highly publicized lawsuit.
Microsoft's version of Java was not &ldquo;write once, run anywhere&rdquo; as
Sun intended Java to be. To much of the Java community, it appeared
as though Microsoft was attempting to splinter Java with extensions
like J/Direct and new Java keywords (&ldquo;delegate&rdquo; and
&ldquo;multicast&rdquo;) that gave Java developers new capabilities not
otherwise available in Java. Applications using these extensions
are required to use Microsoft's JVM.</p><p>At first look, it may seem surprising that a company known
for its open source, clean-room implementation of Java would add
support for Microsoft extensions to the language. However, by
adding support for these extensions to Kaffe, Transvirtual is
allowing Java programs developed under Windows (using Microsoft
Visual J++) that make use of the extensions to run on non-Windows
platforms such as Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris. Additionally,
Transvirtual is providing a new source for Java on the Windows
platforms.</p><p>The first extension Kaffe supports is delegates. The delegate
keyword essentially provides a function pointer. This allows an
application developer to tie an event to a specific user interface
element (such as a push button). Microsoft added the new
&ldquo;delegate&rdquo; keyword to the Java language to support this. (At the
time delegates were introduced, Java was at level 1.0.2 and had not
yet introduced the new 1.1 event model which provides similar
capabilities.) Microsoft Visual J++ is required in order to compile
the Java code if you make use of the delegate keyword. Up until
now, you also had to use Microsoft's JVM to run the compiled Java
application. Kaffe's support for this extension allows non-Windows
users to run Java code that makes use of the delegate extension.
For now, you will still need to compile your application with
Visual J++. But, you can deploy the compiled Java code on Linux or
any other Kaffe-supported platform.</p><p>Delegates is only the first extension that Kaffe will
support. Microsoft's J/Direct provides similar functionality to
Sun's JNI, giving developers access to application-specific
functions. Why would anyone choose J/Direct over JNI? According to
Transvirtual founder and CEO Tim Wilkinson, &ldquo;I wouldn't primarily
expect UNIX users to pick these extensions up and run with them,
but since Windows users are using them, I don't want them marooned
on Windows-NT for the rest of their natural lives. J/Direct
support, in particular, makes it far simpler to move Java code
which uses an application-specific native library to UNIX.&rdquo;
Wilkinson went on to say that J/Direct &ldquo;provides similar
functionality to JNI in, as far as I'm concerned, a much cleaner
fashion.&rdquo;</p><p>Although funding was supplied by Microsoft to add these
extensions to Kaffe, the relationship was initiated by
Transvirtual. Transvirtual wanted to give users the freedom to
choose a non-Microsoft platform even if they developed their code
with Microsoft tools. Microsoft made documentation available on
their web site (see Resources), but did not contribute any code or
other intellectual property. One of the conditions of
Transvirtual's support for the extensions was that the result would
be released as open source under the GNU GPL.</p><p>Why would Microsoft be interested in open-source
implementations of their Java extensions? Sun's lawsuit against
Microsoft has placed the future of Microsoft's Java implementation
in jeopardy. The extensions added to Kaffe are at the heart of the
lawsuit. Many companies are beginning to look for a second source
for Java. A version of Kaffe for Windows with AWT 1.1 and native
threads support was scheduled to be released in late July.</p><p>By supporting delegates (and eventually J/Direct and
Java/COM), Transvirtual has made it possible to take code developed
using J++ and deliver it to Linux. One of the great strengths of
Linux is its interoperability with other operating systems. By
providing this technology to the Linux community, Transvirtual has
added to this strength.</p><p><a href="3482s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="3482s2.html" target="_self">Kaffe OpenVM's Supported
