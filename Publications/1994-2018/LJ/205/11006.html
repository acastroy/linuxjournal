<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #205, May 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Sometimes a large kernel project does a lot of work outside the
standard kernel development process, and then it's difficult to merge
the code into the mainline source tree. This had been going on for
a while with <span   class="bold"><b>Google</b></span>'s Linux port to the
<span   class="bold"><b>Nexus One</b></span> phone. The Nexus One
development process involved lots and lots of &ldquo;micro-patches&rdquo; that
could leave the code in a completely broken state, but that ultimately
added up to the working system it had produced. This goes against
standard kernel development practice, where each patch is expected to
leave the kernel code in a working, testable state.
</p><p>
Another aspect of the Nexus One development process that caused some
problems was the fact that in some cases, the true authors of a given
piece of code could not be clearly established. This was just because
of the way they constructed their changesets, but it made for a sticky
situation for anyone trying to port code back to the official
tree.
</p><p>
Just such an &ldquo;anyone&rdquo; recently appeared in the form of
<span   class="bold"><b>Daniel Walker</b></span>.
With excellent intentions, he tried to wrestle the Nexus One code base
into a form that could be submitted for inclusion to the kernel folks,
some of whom felt that such a merge was actually long overdue.
</p><p>
But because of the difficulty of determining attribution, and partly
because Daniel himself may not have understood the true significance
of some of the attribution fields in git changelogs, Daniel took an
approach that led to some violent conflagrations before it was cleared
up. Since his own patches were significant massages of Google's code,
he just listed himself as the author and attributed the actual
ownership of the code to Google in his changelog comments.
</p><p>
This caused problems, because some people thought Daniel was claiming
authorship for other people's work; while others pointed out that
without a proper chain of &ldquo;signed-off-by&rdquo; fields in the changesets,
there would be no evidence that the code was appropriately GPLed. 
Others (the Google developers) felt that although Daniel wasn't
necessarily claiming work that wasn't his, they still wanted
attribution wherever it was feasible to give it.
</p><p>
Ultimately, the misunderstanding seems to have been cleared up, though
it serves as a good illustration of what can happen when a large
third-party project lets its code deviate beyond a certain degree
from the main kernel tree before attempting to merge it back in.
</p><p>
I've been writing about the <span   class="bold"><b>BKL</b></span> and its
future demise for a long time. Well, the future is now, apparently.
<span   class="bold"><b>Arnd Bergmann</b></span> posted the
patch of his recent dreams, not only taking out the last occurrences
of uses of the BKL, but also removing its actual implementation. It is
gone. Hoots and hollers of glee echoed through the kernel's chambers
as the news was announced. <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span>
reflected, &ldquo;Nice to see it gone&mdash;it seemed such a good idea in
Linux 1.3.&rdquo;
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Reinhard Tartler</b></span> and the <span   class="bold"><b>VAMOS team</b></span> have released <span   class="bold"><b>undertaker</b></span>, a new
tool that does static analysis (automated bug-hunting without
compiling or running the code) for the Linux kernel. They've wound it
tightly against producing false positives, saying it's better to miss
a bug than to report on one incorrectly&mdash;sort of a software version of
&ldquo;innocent until proven guilty&rdquo;.

If you're an e-book reader, chances are you already use the wonderful
Calibre software (<a href="http://www.calibre-ebook.com" target="_self">www.calibre-ebook.com</a>). If not, see
Dan Sawyer's article in the April 2011 issue. Like many avid readers,
however, I still find something soothing about a book made from dead
trees. Unfortunately, it's easy to lose track of all the books I own.
If you're the type of person who lends books out, it can become even
more complicated. Enter Alexandria.
</p><p>
If you have a sizable personal book library, you might be interested
in Alexandria (<a href="http://alexandria.rubyforge.org" target="_self">alexandria.rubyforge.org</a>). With
Alexandria, you 
not only can manage, sort, organize and consolidate your book collection,
but you also can keep track of books you loan out. You can be a tiny
little lending library, without the need for library cards!
</p><p>
At the very least, it's nice to keep track of your books. Alexandria makes
adding books a snap, and most of the time it even automatically downloads
cover art for you. You can go from a pile of dead trees (Figure 1),
to a window full of perfect pixels (Figure 2) easily.

<h2 class="title">Numeric Relativity</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #205, May 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
This month finds us at the cutting edge of physics, numerical general
relativity. Because we haven't perfected mind-to-mind transmission
of information, we won't actually be able to cover in any real
detail how this all works. If you are interested, you can check out
Wikipedia (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM_formalism" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM_formalism</a>) or Living Reviews
(<a href="http://relativity.livingreviews.org/Articles/subject.html#NumRel" target="_self">relativity.livingreviews.org/Articles/subject.html#NumRel</a>). Once
you've done that, and maybe taken a few graduate courses too, you can
go ahead and read this article.
</p><p>
General relativity, along with quantum mechanics, describes the world
as we know it at its most fundamental level. The problem is there
is a very small set of solutions to Einstein's equations. And, they are
all solutions for idealized situations. Here are the
most common ones:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Schwarzschild: static, spherically symmetric.
</p></li><li><p>
Reissner-Nordstrom: static, spherically symmetric, charged.
</p></li><li><p>
Kerr: rotating, spherically symmetric.
</p></li><li><p>
Kerr, Newman: rotating, spherically symmetric, charged.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In order to study more realistic situations, like a pair of black
holes orbiting each other, you need to solve Einstein's equations
numerically. Traditionally, this has been done either from scratch by
each individual researcher, or you may inherit some previous work from
another researcher. But, now there is a project everyone can use,
the Einstein Toolkit. The project started out as Cactus Code. Cactus
Code is a framework consisting of a central core (called the flesh)
and a number of plugins (called thorns). Cactus Code provides a generic
framework for scientific computing in any number of fields. The Einstein
Toolkit is a fork of Cactus Code with only the thorns you need for
numerical relativity.
</p><p>
General relativity is a theory of gravitation, proposed by Einstein,
where time is to be considered simply another dimension, like the
three spatial ones. So the three space and one time dimensions together give
you space-time. Numerical relativity (at least in one of the more
common techniques) re-introduces the break between space and time. The
basic idea is that you describe space at one instance in time, and then
describe with equations how that space changes moving from one time to
another. This technique was introduced by Arnowitt, Deser and Misner,
and is called the ADM formalism. The code in the Einstein Toolkit uses
a variation on this technique.
</p><p>
The toolkit code is available through Subversion and Git. To make
checkouts and updates easier on end users, the development team has
provided a script called GetComponents. This script expects to use
git, so you need git installed on your system. To get it, you can
<tt  >wget</tt> it from:

<pre     class="programlisting">
wget http://svn.cactuscode.org/Utilities/branches/
&#8618;ET_2010_11/Scripts/GetComponents
chmod 777 GetComponents
</pre>
</p><p>
Although there are several options to this script, most people simply
will want to use it to grab the latest code for the Einstein Toolkit:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./GetComponents -a http://svn.einsteintoolkit.org/
&#8618;manifest/branches/ET_2010_11/einsteintoolkit.th
</pre>
</p><p>
This downloads all of the parts you need to get a running system in
the subdirectory Cactus. To update the code, you simply need to run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./GetComponent -a -u ./einsteintoolkit.th
</pre>
</p><p>
You can do it this way because the file einsteintoolkit.th actually
is downloaded to the current directory by the GetComponents script.
</p><p>
This is pretty heavy-duty number crunching, so you likely will need to
make sure you have several other packages installed on your system. You
will need a C compiler, a C++ compiler and a FORTRAN compiler. You'll
probably want to install MPI as well. File input and output is available
in ASCII, but you may want to consider HDF5 for more structured data. Some
thorns also may need some specialized libraries, such as LAPACK. This
depends on which thorns you actually are using.
</p><p>
The way Einstein Toolkit is set up, you create and use a
configuration for a particular executable. This way, you can have
multiple configurations, which use different thorn combinations, all
from the same core source code. To create a new configuration, it is
as simple as typing <tt  >make configname</tt>, where configname is the name you give
to the configuration. For the rest of this article, let's play with a
configuration called config1. So you would type <tt  >make
config1</tt>, and
get a new subdirectory called config1 containing all the required
files. Don't forget that this needs to be done from within the Cactus
directory that was created by the GetComponents script. Once this
initialization is done, you can execute several different commands against
this configuration. An example would be <tt  >make
config1-configinfo</tt>, which
prints out the configuration options for this particular configuration
(Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11006einsteinf1.large.jpg"><img src="11006einsteinf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Example Configuration Options
</p></div></div><p>
The first step is making sure everything is 
configured properly. When you created your new configuration above, the config
command was run for you. If you decide that you actually wanted to
include some other options, you can rerun the config command with
<tt  >make config1-config &lt;options&gt;</tt>, where
<tt  >&lt;options&gt;</tt> are the options you
wanted to set. These options are in the form
<tt  >&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</tt>. An example
would be <tt  >MPI=MPICH</tt>, if you wanted to compile in support for MPICH
parallelism. For now, you can just enter the following to do a basic
configuration:

<pre     class="programlisting">
make config1-config MPI=MPICH
</pre>
</p><p>
If you ever want to start over, you can try
<tt  >make config1-clean</tt> or <tt  >make
config1-realclean</tt>. If you are done with
this particular configuration, you can get rid of it completely
with <tt  >make config1-delete</tt>.
</p><p>
Now that everything is configured exactly the way you want it, you
should go ahead and build it. This is done simply with the command
<tt  >make config1</tt>. Now, go off and have a cup of your favourite beverage
while your machine is brought to its knees with the compile. This is a
fairly complex piece of software, so don't be too disappointed if it
doesn't compile cleanly on the first attempt. Just go over the error
messages carefully, and make whatever changes are necessary. The most
likely causes are either that you don't have a needed library installed
or the make system can't find it. Keep iterating through the build
step until you get a fully compiled executable. It should be located in
the subdirectory exe. In this case, you will end up with an executable
called cactus_config1.
</p><p>
You can run some basic tests on this executable with the command
<tt  >make
config1-testsuite</tt>. It will ask you some questions as to what you want to
test, but you should be okay if you accept the defaults most of the time. When
you get to the end, you can ask the system to run all of the tests, 
run them interactively or choose a particular test to run. Remember,
if you are using MPICH, you need to have mpd running on the relevant hosts
so the test suite will run correctly. This by no means guarantees the
correctness of the code. It's just the first step in the process. As in
any scientific programming, you should make sure the results you're getting are at least plausible.
</p><p>
Now that you have your executable, you need some data to feed
it. This is the other side of the problem&mdash;the &ldquo;initial data&rdquo;
problem. The Einstein Toolkit uses a parameter file to hand in the
required parameters for all of the thorns being used. The development
team has provided some introductory parameter files (located at
<a href="https://svn.einsteintoolkit.org/cactus/EinsteinExamples/branches/ET_2010_06/par" target="_self">https://svn.einsteintoolkit.org/cactus/EinsteinExamples/branches/ET_2010_06/par</a>)
that beginners can download to learn what is possible. To
run your executable, run it as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cactus_config1 parfile.par
</pre>
</p><p>
If you are running an MPI version, it would look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mpirun -np X cactus_config1 parfile.par
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
where <tt  >X</tt> is the number of CPUs to use, and
<tt  >parfile.par</tt> is the parameter file
to use.
</p><p>
As it stands, the Einstein Toolkit provides a very powerful set of tools
for doing numerical relativity. But, this is only the beginning. The true
power is in its extensibility. It is distributed under the GPL, so you
are free to download it and alter it as you see fit. You just have to
be willing to share those changes. But, the entire design of the toolkit
is based around the idea that you should be able to alter the system
easily. It's as simple as writing and including a new thorn. Because
you have all the source code for the included thorns, you have some
very good examples to look at and learn from. And, because thorns are ideally
independent from each other, you should be able to drop in your
new thorn easily. The list of thorns to be compiled and linked into the flesh
is controlled through the file configs/config1/ThornList.
</p><p>
In case you decide to write your own thorn, I'll cover a bit of the
concepts here. A thorn should, ideally, be completely unlinked from any
other thorn. Any communication should happen through the flesh. This
means that data should be translated into one of the standard formats
and handed off to the flesh. The thorns are responsible for everything
from IO to data management to the actual number crunching. If you are
working on some new algorithm or solution technique, this is
where you want to be.
</p><p>
The last step is getting pretty graphics. You likely will want
to share your results with others, and that seems to be easiest
through pictures. You will want to use other tools, like gnuplot,
to generate plots or even movies of the results from your
calculations. Several tutorials exist for what you can do
with tools like gnuplot.
</p><p>
I hope this has given you enough to get started with a very powerful
tool for numerical relativity. And, as always, if there is a subject
you'd like to see, please let me know. Until then, keep exploring.

<h2 class="title">Recycle's Friend, Reuse</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #205, May 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Recycling is something we all deal with, or at least should deal with,
when it comes to technology. Old computers, monitors, motherboards and
their ilk are full of toxic chemicals that must be disposed of properly.
Thankfully, &ldquo;Being Green&rdquo; is a trend that hasn't really lost any steam.
As technologists, we understand the need to use less power, recycle old
technology and make wise purchasing decisions when it comes to hardware.
And, we shouldn't forget recycle's buddies <span   class="emphasis"><em>reduce</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>reuse</em></span> either.
</p><p>
With modern virtualization, it's possible to reduce the number of servers
we need to buy. Add to that the reduction in power usage with low-power
CPUs, and it's relatively easy to reduce the amount of waste in our
server rooms. Unfortunately, it doesn't eliminate the problem completely.
That's where reuse comes into play. In the photo, you'll see a clock
I received as a Christmas gift. It's simply the circuit board from some
sort of router that has &ldquo;clock guts&rdquo; added to it. Geeky yes, but if it's
stuck on my wall, it's one fewer piece of computer scrap in a landfill.
</p><p>
No, reusing old technology like this won't solve our technology waste
problem, but every little bit helps. Plus, items like my picture frame
made from old 30-pin SIMM memory chips make for great conversation
pieces. How have you reused technology in nontraditional ways?
Send a photo to <a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>, and I'll post some of them
on our Web site. Perhaps we'll all get some gift ideas for the next
holiday season!

<h2 class="title">Organize Your Shows with Sickbeard</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #205, May 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
First, a disclaimer: the program Sickbeard was created for the
purpose of pirating television shows from Usenet and torrent sites.
I don't condone piracy of any sort, but Sickbeard has some amazing
<span   class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span>
features that make it worth mentioning.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11006sickf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Sickbeard is a server-based application that runs on your file server, and
it can manage and sort all of your television shows. If you have a collection
of TV episodes you've recorded with MythTV, ripped from DVD, pulled
from TiVo or however you might have procured them, organizing them
in a way that programs like Boxee or XBMC understand can be daunting.
Sickbeard is a program that can sort, organize and rename episodes
automatically. It lets you know if you are missing episodes, and it can
download metadata and cover art. It even can notify you with a pop-up on
your XBMC home-theater device when a new episode is added to your library.
</p><p>
Again, Sickbeard was designed with nefarious intentions in mind, but even if you don't want to pirate television shows from Usenet,
it's a great way to keep your XBMC database organized. Check it out
