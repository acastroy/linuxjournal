The keys have been in my truck's ignition ever since I bought it. In fact,
as far back as I can remember, I've left my keys in the ignition of every vehicle
I've ever owned. This lack of security works fairly well for me, because I live
in a very rural area and drive fairly undesirable vehicles. Does that make me
an idiot? Well, I agree I'm a bit na&iuml;ve, and possibly foolish, but considering
how often I lose things, it's a risk I'm willing to take.
</p><p>
My servers, however, don't have the luxury of a rural environment. The Internet
knows no backwater, and anything plugged in to the Net is vulnerable, regardless
of location. We've dedicated this issue to security. As Linux users, we may brag
about how secure our systems are, but a system is only as secure as you make it,
so it's important to read this issue and make sure you're doing your part to
keep your system clean.
</p><p>
Our resident security whiz, Mick Bauer, gets us started by explaining DNS cache
poisoning. If you use DNS (and if you use the Internet, you do), it's important
to learn how to keep your system safe from getting hijacked. Kyle Rankin also
helps us with our servers, but in his column, he explains how to install a blog.
Sure, you can host your blog elsewhere, but if you want to control every aspect
of it, you'll want to install it on your own server. Kyle shows how.
</p><p>
Everyone knows the first line of defense when it comes to a network is the
firewall. This month, we look at two different methods to set up your own. I
review Untangle, which is a Linux-based firewall solution designed to be a
one-stop shop for all your firewalling and filtering needs. Untangle is a
complete distro, and it comes with both free and commercial modules. Whether you
want to set up a simple firewall or provide Web filtering, load
balancing, virus scanning and so forth, Untangle is a simple product for very
complicated tasks. If you prefer to set up your own firewall server, however,
Mike Horn shows how to use Firewall Builder to create a custom, highly
available firewall on your own box. There even are GUI tools, which I always
appreciate.
</p><p>
Preparing for attack is a great idea, but sometimes it's good practice to attack
your own servers, just to make sure they're secure. Raphael Mudge teaches how
to shoot our servers in the foot using Armitage and Metasploit. They may sound
like comic-book antagonists, but these two software packages really can reveal
weak points in your security. Knowledge is power, and with security, the more
you know the better.
</p><p>
Jeramiah Bowling takes us into the world of virtual servers this month, for some
unique vulnerabilities to watch for when using a virtual environment. For
the most part, virtual servers behave just like their steel and silicon
counterparts, but they offer one more layer of vulnerability, so we should be
careful how we secure them. Aleksey Tsalolikhin provides a different take on a
well-known product this month as well, as he demonstrates Cfengine's ability to
assist in securing computers. Anyone who manages configurations for
multiple computers is familiar with Cfengine, but Aleksey describes some
features we may not have considered before.
</p><p>
If all this talk of security is making you paranoid, don't worry. In this issue
of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, we still have the reviews, product announcements, and
columns you're used to. Whether it's Reuven M. Lerner's column on Node.JS, Dave
Taylor's continuation of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mad Libs</em></span> game he started last month, or Kyle Rankin and
Bill Childer's new column Tales from the Server Room, this issue should
entertain and educate, even if you're not a security nut.
</p><p>
Remember, just because I'm foolish with my car keys doesn't mean you need to be
foolish with computer security. I always can offset my bad key habits with GPS
tracking and hidden security cameras. If you put your password on a Post-It note
stuck to your monitor, this issue won't help you. There's
not a firewall in the world that can fix lazy!
