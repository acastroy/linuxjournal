If your blog isn't on your own server, is it truly yours? Learn how
to set up your own.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a03580.0x2afb408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This column is the third in a
series about how to manage your own services on your own server. In the
first column, I discussed how to make sure your home network is ready to
host your own services. In the second, I covered DNS, and in this column,
I talk about one of the services people commonly put in the cloud
but is simple to host yourself: a blog.
</p><p>
At first, I planned to focus this series strictly on how to set up
your own Web server, but I realized that these days, most people don't
simply set up Apache and upload some static HTML. Instead, most modern
sites are built so that their content is generated dynamically, often
with data stored on a database. Instead of just a basic static page,
today if you want to set up your own Web server at home, you probably
want to host a forum, post some information about yourself,
share some pictures or, quite likely, manage your own blog.

What Flavor Is the Best?</h2></div></div><p>
Many different types of blogs exist&mdash;from sites that
attempt to replicate the function of a physical magazine on the Web
to sites that act as a person's public diary to sites that just link
to other interesting content. And, just as many different
types of blogging software are available under Linux. Each type of blogging
software has its advantages and disadvantages, but for the purposes of
this article, I had to pick one. I chose WordPress because
it's relatively simple to set up and has a large user base, which means
it should be easier for you to get support from the community.
</p><p>
I not only had to choose what blogging software to cover, I
also had to decide on a base distribution. When it comes to Apache and
WordPress, although the software itself is basically the same across major
Linux distributions, the organization of that software can be quite
different. Because I'm aiming this column at someone who has never set up
a Web server before, I'm going to use Ubuntu Server here (specifically
10.04 LTS), as I think the way it has organized Apache configuration and
WordPress is the most friendly for the new system administrator.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a03580.0x2afb6c8"></a>
Install the Software</h2></div></div><p>
The first step in the process is to install WordPress, Apache and all
of the dependencies this software needs. On a modern Linux distribution,
this is relatively simple. In the case of Ubuntu, simply type the following
into a terminal:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo apt-get install apache2 mysql-server wordpress
</pre>
</p><p>
Those packages will pull down the Web server software, the MySQL server
that WordPress will access on this same machine and WordPress itself, along
with all of its dependencies. During the install, you will be prompted to
choose a password for the MySQL root user. Although you optionally can leave
this blank, I advise you to choose a password and document it somewhere. If
you decide to leave it blank, you always can add a password to the root
user later, but it's much simpler to set it here.

Ubuntu Apache2 Site Organization</h2></div></div><p>
Apache2 under Ubuntu (and Debian-based distributions in general) has a
somewhat unique way to organize Apache configuration. If you ever
have managed multiple Web sites on a single Apache instance (often referred
to as virtual hosts), you know how challenging it sometimes can be to
organize each site's configuration along with all the modules you
need Apache to load. Under Ubuntu, all of the currently available virtual
hosts and modules store their files under /etc/apache2/sites-available
and /etc/apache2/mods-available, respectively. Any virtual hosts
or modules that are enabled are set up as symbolic links under
/etc/apache2/sites-enabled and /etc/apache2/mods-enabled. Along with
this new organization, the apache2 package includes a set of new tools
to enable and disable sites and modules. For instance, if you added a
new virtual host configuration at /etc/apache2/sites-available/foo and
wanted to enable it, you would type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo a2ensite foo
</pre>
</p><p>
That command creates the necessary symlinks for you in
/etc/apache2/sites-enabled. Likewise, if you wanted to load a module
named cgi that you see under /etc/apache2/mods-available, you would type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo a2enmod cgi
</pre>
</p><p>
To undo the above two commands, you would type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo a2dissite foo
$ sudo a2dismod foo
</pre>
</p><p>
Although it's true that you could set up these symlinks manually, the
included commands certainly make it more clear and easier to script.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a03580.0x2afbc48"></a>
Set Up Your WordPress Virtual Host</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you are familiar with how Apache organizes files under
Ubuntu, the next step is to configure a new virtual host. It
turns out there are a number of different ways you can
configure the WordPress virtual host under Apache, and included
in the wordpress package are examples of the different methods
under /usr/share/doc/wordpress/example/apache.conf. For this
article, I'm choosing a configuration that makes it simple to manage
multiple WordPress sites on the same host, so create a file called
/etc/apache2/sites-available/wordpress that contains the following data:

<pre     class="programlisting">

NameVirtualHost *:80

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    UseCanonicalName Off
    VirtualDocumentRoot /var/www/%0
    Options All
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Now, enable this new site and disable any default virtual hosts
Apache may have included:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo a2ensite wordpress
$ sudo a2dissite default
</pre>
</p><p>
In my example, I have used the Apache option VirtualDocumentRoot, so I can
more easily manage multiple WordPress sites. Unfortunately, the module
to allow that feature isn't enabled by default, so I also need
to enable the vhost_alias module so that feature works:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo a2enmod vhost_alias
</pre>
</p><p>
The way I have set up WordPress, each WordPress site you host from this
server will have its own document root under /var/www/&lt;domainname&gt;. When
you add a new site, you need to create a symlink under /var/www/ named
after your domain name that points to the installed WordPress software. In
my case, I want to create a site called www.example.org, so I would type:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo ln -s /usr/share/wordpress /var/www/www.example.org
</pre>
</p><p>
Instead of www.example.org, put the fully qualified domain name you are
going to use for your site. While you're at it, if you haven't already
set up an A record on your DNS server that points to your new site, now
would be a good time. If you followed the steps in my previous column to
set up a DNS server of your own, you already should have an entry in place
for www. Simply change the IP address to point to the external, public
IP address you will use for your Web server and reload the bind9 service.
</p><p>
After the symlink is created, I use the apache2ctl Apache management
tool to reload Apache:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo apache2ctl graceful
</pre>
</p><p>
Note: the apache2ctl program is the main command-line program you
will use to manage the Apache service on your machine. In addition
to the graceful argument, which tells Apache to reload any new
configuration you have changed safely (such as when you add new sites), you
also can
use the following commands.
</p><p>
To restart Apache by forcibly stopping existing processes and starting
them again:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo apache2ctl restart
</pre>
</p><p>
To start Apache if it is completely stopped:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo apache2ctl start
</pre>
</p><p>
To stop Apache hard (kill all of the current processes even if they are
still processing a user request):

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo apache2ctl stop
</pre>
</p><p>
To stop Apache gracefully (it will kill processes only after they are
finished with their current request):

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo apache2ctl graceful-stop
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a03580.0x2afc488"></a>
Configure MySQL for WordPress</h2></div></div><p>
Like with many dynamic sites these days, WordPress gets
its data from a database back end: in this case, MySQL. The
wordpress package includes a nice little shell script you can
use to set up your MySQL database automatically for your site at
/usr/share/doc/wordpress/examples/setup-mysql. All you have to do is
pass it the -n option and tell it the name of the MySQL user you want
to use and the name of the database. In my case, I use the user name
&ldquo;wordpress&rdquo; and name the database after my site, www.example.org:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo bash /usr/share/doc/wordpress/examples/setup-mysql 
 &#8618;-n wordpress www.example.org
</pre>
</p><p>
Note: this command attempts to ping the domain name that you list,
so if you haven't set up the domain in DNS yet, you will want to do it
before you run the above command. Again, make sure your domain points
to the public IP address you will use for your site.

Figure 1. The Default WordPress Configuration Page
</p></div></div><p>
Once you get to this point, your blog actually should be ready to use. All
you need to do is visit http://www.example.org (in your case, you would
visit the URL you set up for your blog), and you should be greeted with
the initial WordPress configuration page as shown in Figure 1. From
that point, all you have to do is enter the title for your blog and the
contact e-mail you'd like to use. WordPress will present you with the
admin user name and a temporary password. From there, you can log in
and start tweaking, creating posts and changing your theme.
