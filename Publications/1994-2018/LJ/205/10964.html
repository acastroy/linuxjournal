Tired of maintaining your expensive commercial firewalls? Check out how
combining Firewall Builder with a Linux HA firewall pair can provide a big
solution at a low price.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x279a580.0x2892250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Many enterprise networks require redundant HA (High Availability)
infrastructure for key systems like network firewalls. This article
demonstrates how you can use a combination of open-source packages to
build and manage a Linux-based HA firewall pair that includes support
for many of the advanced features commonly found in commercial firewalls.
</p><p>
The collection of open-source packages that I use to create the HA firewall
in this article
are iptables, conntrackd, keepalived and Firewall Builder. The network
diagram in Figure 1 shows the example environment that will be configured.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10964f1.large.jpg"><img src="10964f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. HA Diagram
</p></div></div><p>
The example uses a pair of servers running Ubuntu Server 10.10 that will
be configured to run in an Active-Backup configuration. This means
traffic will be going through only one firewall at any given time. More
complex Active-Active solutions also are possible, but are beyond the
scope of this article.
</p><p>
The conntrackd and keepalived packages are installed on both servers
using apt-get. Since many commands require root privileges to run,
the examples are shown using user root to help keep things concise.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x279a580.0x28926c8"></a>
Conntrackd Overview and Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Conntrackd is a d&aelig;mon developed by the netfilter.org project,
the same organization that develops iptables. Conntrackd synchronizes
the state of active connections between two or more firewalls running
iptables.
</p><p>
In an Active-Backup configuration, like the example in this article, each
time a connection is allowed through the active firewall, information
about this connection is sent to the backup firewall. In the event of
a failover, the backup firewall already will have information about the
active allowed connections, so that existing connections do not have to
be re-established after the failover occurs.
</p><p>
The example here is based on one of the example configuration
files that comes with conntrackd. This configuration uses the FTFW
reliable protocol to synchronize the connection data between the
firewalls. There is also a script called primary-backup.sh that provides
integration between keepalived and conntrackd. For Ubuntu, these example
files are located in the /usr/share/doc/conntrackd/examples/sync/ directory.
</p><p>
Run the commands listed below to copy the sample config file
and failover script to the default directory for conntrackd,
/etc/conntrackd/conntrackd.conf:


<pre     class="programlisting">
root@lj-fw-1:/# cd /usr/share/doc/conntrackd/examples/sync
root@lj-fw-1:/# gunzip ftfw/conntrackd.conf.gz
root@lj-fw-1:/# cp ftfw/conntrackd.conf /etc/conntrackd/
root@lj-fw-1:/# cp primary-backup.sh /etc/conntrackd
</pre>
</p><p>
Open the /etc/conntrackd/conntrackd.conf file for editing, and find the
section in the file called Multicast. Edit the default values in
this section to match the example network environment shown in Figure 1.


<pre     class="programlisting">
Multicast {
  IPv4_address 225.0.0.50
  IPv4_interface 192.168.100.2 # IP of eth2 interface, 
                               # used for conntrackd synch
  Interface eth2
  Group 3780
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, find the section at the bottom of the configuration file called
IgnoreTrafficFor and edit the default values in this section to
match the example network environment:

<pre     class="programlisting">
IgnoreTrafficFor {
  IPv4_address 127.0.0.1 # loopback
  IPv4_address 192.168.1.2 # eth0 interface IP
  IPv4_address 10.1.1.2 # eth1 interface IP
  IPv4_address 192.168.100.2 # eth2 interface IP
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Repeat the same process for the lj-fw-2 server, making sure to use the
correct interface IP addresses for the lj-fw-2 server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x279a580.0x2892bf0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Two Interface Firewalls</b></p><p>
This example uses a dedicated interface for the conntrackd synchronization
traffic, which is recommended for optimal security and performance. If your
firewall has only two network interfaces, modify the
&ldquo;Multicast&rdquo;
section of conntrackd.conf to use the inside interface name and IP address.
</p></div><p>
When the package is installed, an /etc/init.d/conntrackd script is
created. To test the configuration, start conntrackd and then run the
status command to verify it is running properly (note: conntrackd needs
to be started on both the lj-fw-1 and lj-fw-2 firewalls):

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@lj-fw-1:/# /etc/init.d/conntrackd start
root@lj-fw-1:/# conntrackd -s
cache internal:
current active connections:            1
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x279a580.0x2892f08"></a></h2></div></div><p>
(Additional output removed for brevity.)
</p><p>
For more information about configuring conntrackd, see the conntrackd
configuration manual listed in the Resources for this article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x279a580.0x2893068"></a>
Keepalived Overview and Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
The keepalived d&aelig;mon allows two or more servers to share a virtual IP
address. Only one server, called the master, will respond to packets
sent to the virtual IP address. The other servers are in backup mode,
ready to take over the virtual IP address if the master server fails.
</p><p>
By default, keepalived uses the configuration file
/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf. The following is a very basic
keepalived.conf configuration: 

</p><p>
lj-fw-1 /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf file contents:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vrrp_sync_group {
 group {
  fw-cluster-eth0
  fw-cluster-eth1
 }
 notify_master "/etc/conntrackd/primary-backup.sh primary"
 notify_backup "/etc/conntrackd/primary-backup.sh backup"
 notify_fault "/etc/conntrackd/primary-backup.sh fault"
}
vrrp_instance fw-cluster-eth0 {
 state MASTER
 interface eth0
 virtual_router_id 20
 priority 100
 virtual_ipaddress {
  192.168.1.1/24 brd 192.168.1.255 dev eth0
 }
}
vrrp_instance fw-cluster-eth1 {
 state MASTER
 interface eth1
 virtual_router_id 30
 priority 100
 virtual_ipaddress {
  10.1.1.1/24 brd 10.1.1.255 dev eth1 
 }
}
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x279a580.0x28932d0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Additional options, like neighbor
authentication, are available. More information about advanced
configuration options is available at the keepalived Web site (see
Resources).
</p><p>
The configuration for lj-fw-2 is very similar, with only a few values
changed to identify that this system is acting as a backup:


<pre     class="programlisting">
vrrp_sync_group {
 group {
  fw-cluster-eth0
  fw-cluster-eth1
 }
 notify_master "/etc/conntrackd/primary-backup.sh primary"
 notify_backup "/etc/conntrackd/primary-backup.sh backup"
 notify_fault "/etc/conntrackd/primary-backup.sh fault"
}
vrrp_instance fw-cluster-eth0 {
 state BACKUP
 interface eth0
 virtual_router_id 20
 priority 50
 virtual_ipaddress {
  192.168.1.1/24 brd 192.168.1.255 dev eth0
 }
}
vrrp_instance fw-cluster-eth1 {
 state BACKUP
 interface eth1
 virtual_router_id 30
 priority 50
 virtual_ipaddress {
  10.1.1.1/24 brd 10.1.1.255 dev eth1
 }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
One of the benefits of keepalived is that it provides sync_groups&mdash;a
feature to ensure that if one of the interfaces in the sync_group
transitions from the master to the backup, all the other interfaces
in the sync_group also transition to the backup. This is important for
Active-Backup HA firewall deployments where all the traffic must flow
in and out of the same firewall.
</p><p>
The sync_group configuration includes information about the scripts to
call in the event of a VRRP transition on the local server to the master,
backup or fault states. The primary-backup.sh script, which was copied
to the /etc/conntrackd directory earlier, informs conntrackd of VRRP
state transitions so that conntrackd knows which firewall is currently
acting as the master.
</p><p>
VRRP uses priority numbering to determine which firewall should be the
master when both firewalls are on-line. The firewall with the highest
priority number is chosen as the master. Because the lj-fw-1 server has the
highest priority number, as long as the lj-fw-1 server is
&ldquo;alive&rdquo;,
it will respond to traffic sent to the virtual IP addresses. If the
lj-fw-1 server fails, the lj-fw-2 server automatically will take
over the virtual IP addresses and respond to traffic sent to it.
</p><p>
When using VRRP, devices on the network should be configured to route
through the <span   class="emphasis"><em>virtual IP address</em></span>. In
this example, devices on the internal LAN that are going out through the
HA firewall pair should be configured with a default gateway of 10.1.1.1.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x279a580.0x2893748"></a>
Firewall Builder Overview and Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Now that there are two servers configured and ready to act as HA firewalls,
it's time to add rules. In most HA pairs, the rules should be identical
on both firewalls. Although this can be done by manually entering iptables
commands, it can be difficult to maintain and is easy for errors to
occur. Firewall Builder makes it simple to configure and maintain a
synchronized set of rules on both of the HA firewall servers.
</p><p>
Firewall Builder is a GUI-based firewall configuration management
application that supports a wide range of firewalls, including
iptables. Information about downloading and installing Firewall Builder
can be found on the Firewall Builder Web site, including a
Quick Start Guide (see Resources) that provides a high-level overview of
the GUI layout and key concepts.
</p><p>
Multiple firewalls can be managed from a single workstation using Firewall
Builder. SSH and SCP are used to transfer the generated firewall scripts
to the remote firewalls, so it is recommended that the Firewall Builder
application be run on a different workstation and not on one of the
firewall servers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x279a580.0x2893958"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
About Firewall Builder</b></p><p>
Originally started in 2000, Firewall Builder is an open-source project with
thousands of users around the world using it to manage production
firewalls. In addition to iptables, Firewall Builder also includes support
for configuring BSD pf, Cisco ASA, PIX and FWSM firewalls, Cisco
router access, ipfw and ipfilter firewalls. Commercial licenses are
available for prebuilt MS Windows and Mac OS X packages.
</p></div><p>
The focus of this article is using Firewall Builder's cluster feature
to manage a single firewall policy for the HA firewall pair, but let's
start with a quick overview of a few key Firewall Builder concepts.
</p><p>
Objects form the foundation of the Firewall Builder GUI. Objects are
used to represent common firewall rule elements, such as IP networks, IP
hosts and TCP and UDP protocols. Firewall Builder comes with hundreds of
predefined objects for common elements, like well-known TCP services. The
same object can be used in firewall rules on multiple firewalls, letting
users define an object once and use it as many times as needed.
</p><p>
After a firewall object has been created and rules have been configured
for that firewall, Firewall Builder generates a script that will be
run on the target firewall server to implement the firewall rules that
were defined in the GUI. The process of creating this script is called
compiling the firewall rules. The generated firewall script 
also can be used to manage interface IP addresses, static routes and various
system settings.
</p><p>
For more information about Firewall Builder basics, go to the
NetCitadel Web site (see Resources), which includes a comprehensive Users
Guide.
</p><p>
Now, let's dive in to configuring the firewall cluster with Firewall
Builder. In order to create an HA firewall pair, called a cluster in
Firewall Builder, you first need to configure the
individual firewall objects that will be members of the cluster.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x279a580.0x288a5b0"></a>
Creating Firewall Objects in Firewall Builder</h2></div></div><p>
Click the Create new firewall button in the middle of the main
window to launch the new firewall wizard that provides a series of
dialog windows to walk you through the process of creating a new
firewall object.
</p><p>
Set the firewall name (lj-fw-1) and platform type (iptables) in the first
dialog and click the Next button. Leave the default setting of
&ldquo;Configure interfaces manually&rdquo; on the next dialog window, and click
the Next button. The final dialog window is where the interfaces
for the firewall are defined. Follow the steps shown below to add the
interfaces for the lj-fw-1 firewall.
</p><p>
Step 1: click the green + sign to create a new interface:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Set the interface name to &ldquo;eth0&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
Set the interface label to &ldquo;outside&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
Click the Add address button.
</p></li><li><p>
Enter 192.168.1.2 with Netmask of 255.255.255.0.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Step 2: click the green + sign to create a new interface, and
repeat the steps from Step 1 to configure eth1 (&ldquo;eth1&rdquo;,
&ldquo;inside&rdquo;, 10.1.1.2,
255.255.255.0).
</p><p>
Step 3: click the green + sign to create a new interface, and
repeat the steps from Step 1 to configure eth2 (&ldquo;eth2&rdquo;,
&ldquo;synch&rdquo;, 192.168.100.2,
255.255.255.0).
</p><p>
Step 4: click the green + sign to create a new interface, and
repeat the steps from Step 1 to configure lo (&ldquo;lo&rdquo;,
&ldquo;loopback&rdquo;, 127.0.0.1,
255.0.0.0).
</p><p>
Figure 2 shows an example of the interface dialog window after the first
interface, eth0, has been defined. Once all interfaces are configured,
click the Finish button to create the firewall object.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10964f2.large.jpg"><img src="10964f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Set Interface Dialog Window for New Firewall Wizard
</p></div></div><p>
The newly created firewall object will be displayed in the object tree
in the left object tree panel. Right-click on the lj-fw-1 object and
select Duplicate&rarr;Place in Library User from the menu. This creates
an exact copy of lj-fw-1 in the object tree and opens it for editing in
the editor panel at the bottom of the screen.
</p><p>
Rename the newly created firewall object to lj-fw-2. Click
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;
on the warning message that is displayed about changing the name of all
child objects. The lj-fw-2 firewall object will show in the object tree
with all its child objects expanded.
</p><p>
When the firewall is duplicated, the interface IP addresses on the new
firewall are the same as the interface IP addresses on the original
firewall. Update the interface IP addresses to match the correct IP
addresses for the eth0 interface on the lj-fw-2 firewall as shown
in Figure 3. Repeat this process for IP addresses of interfaces eth1
and eth2.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10964f3.large.jpg"><img src="10964f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Changing Interface IP Addresses on the Copied Firewall
</p></div></div><p>
The final step is to identify the interface that will be used to manage
each of the lj-fw-1 and lj-fw-2 firewalls. This will be used later by
the installer to determine which IP address to use to connect to the
firewall. Double-click on the interface object named &ldquo;eth1&rdquo; of
the lj-fw-1 firewall to open it for editing and check the box labeled
&ldquo;Management interface&rdquo; in the editor panel. Repeat the process for
the lj-fw-2 firewall.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x279a580.0x288b4d0"></a>
Creating Cluster Objects in Firewall Builder</h2></div></div><p>
Now that the firewall objects have been created, the next step is to
create a new cluster object with the lj-fw-1 and lj-fw-2 firewalls as
members of the cluster. Right-click on the Cluster system folder in
the object tree and select the New Cluster menu item. This launches
the new cluster wizard, which walks you through the steps required to
create a new firewall cluster.
</p><p>
On the first dialog window, enter the cluster name (lj-fw-cluster),
and select lj-fw-1 and lj-fw-2 as cluster members (make sure lj-fw-1
is the master). Click the Next button.
</p><p>
Leave the default settings in the next dialog window and click the Next
button.
</p><p>
The third dialog window (Figure 4) is where the failover protocol
and virtual IP addresses are defined. For each interface tab at the top
of the dialog window, enter the values according to the information in
Table 1.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x279a580.0x288b6e0"></a><p class="title"><b>

Figure 4. Setting Cluster Interface Values
</p></div></div><p>
After all interfaces have been configured, click Next. On the next
dialog window, leave the default setting of &ldquo;Do not use any, I will
create new Policy and NAT rules&rdquo;, and click Next. The final
dialog window will show a summary of the cluster configuration. Review
it, and if everything is correct, click Finish to create the cluster
object.
</p><p>
After the cluster is created, it is displayed in the object
tree. Double-click on the &ldquo;State Synch Group&rdquo; object located under the
newly created lj-fw-cluster object. The State Synch Group defines
the interfaces that are being used for the conntrackd FTFW synchronization
traffic. Click on the Manage Members button at the bottom of the
editor panel. In the dialog window that appears, click the eth2 interface
below the lj-fw-1 firewall and click the right arrow to add the
interface as a cluster member. Repeat the process for the eth2 interface
of the lj-fw-2 firewall. Click OK to accept the changes.
</p><p>
Double-click the Policy object under the lj-fw-cluster object in the
object tree. The Policy is where the firewall rules are configured. Click
the green + sign at the top of the window to add a new rule. By default,
new firewall rules are set to deny everything. Edit rules by
dragging and dropping objects from the object tree into the fields of
the rule.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x279a580.0x288c6b0"></a>
Configuring Rules for the Cluster</h2></div></div><p>
For this example, let's create three simple firewall rules and a
single NAT rule. The first firewall rule should be a rule that allows the
firewall to communicate with itself using the loopback interface. This
is needed because many applications rely on unfiltered access to the
loopback for interprocess communication.
</p><p>
Drag and drop the interface object named &ldquo;lo&rdquo; from the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>lj-fw-cluster</em></span>
in the object tree to the Interface field of
the rule on the right. Right-click in the Action field of the rule and
select Accept. Finally, right-click in the Options field of the rule and
select Logging Off. After this is done, the rule should look like Figure 5.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10964f5.large.jpg"><img src="10964f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Rule to Allow Interprocess Communication Using the Loopback
</p></div></div><p>
Note that the lo interface object used in the rule was from the cluster
object, not an individual firewall's loopback interface object. When
Firewall Builder generates the firewall configuration script for each
individual firewall, it automatically replaces the cluster interface
object with the local interface values for that firewall.
</p><p>
The next two rules use a Network object called Internal LAN that
has been created with a value of 10.1.1.0/24. To create a new Network
object, double-click the Objects folder in the object tree, right-click
on the Networks system folder and select New Network. Fill in the object
name and network value in the editor panel at the bottom of the screen.
</p><p>
Right-click on the first rule, and select Add New Rule Below to add another
rule to the firewall. The second firewall rule will allow traffic from the
Internal LAN object to access the firewall on the internal eth1 interface
using SSH. Drag and drop the Internal LAN object from the object tree
to the Source field of the newly created rule. Drag and drop the eth1
interface from the <span   class="emphasis"><em>lj-fw-cluster</em></span> cluster to
the Destination field.
</p><p>
Firewall Builder comes with hundreds of predefined objects, including most
well-known protocols like SSH. Switch to the Standard object library
to access the predefined objects. Figure 6 shows the location of the
library selection menu at the top of the object tree.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10964f6.large.jpg"><img src="10964f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Library Selection Menu
</p></div></div><p>
To find the SSH object in the Standard library quickly, type
<tt  >ssh</tt>
into the filter box at the top of the object tree. Drag and drop the ssh
object to the Service field of the firewall rule. Remember to clear the
filter by clicking the X next to the filter box.
</p><p>
Switch back to the User library, and drag and drop the eth1 object from the
lj-fw-cluster object to the Interface field of the rule. Right-click on
Direction field and select Inbound. Finally, right-click on the Action
field and set it to Accept. If you want to log SSH connections to the
firewall, leave the Options field set to Logging On; otherwise, set it to
Logging Off.
</p><p>
Follow the same process to create the third rule, which should allow
the Internal LAN to access Internet Web servers using HTTP and HTTPS
going out the eth0 &ldquo;outside&rdquo; interface. Figure 7 shows the Policy
configuration for all three firewall rules.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10964f7.large.jpg"><img src="10964f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Cluster Firewall Configured with Three Firewall Rules
</p></div></div><p>
Notice that we didn't enter any rules to allow the VRRP or conntrackd
traffic between the firewalls. Firewall Builder automatically generates
these rules based on the configuration of the cluster.
</p><p>
The last step is to configure the NAT rule that will translate the source
IP address of all traffic originating from the internal LAN going to the
Internet to the outside virtual IP address of the firewall. Using the
virtual IP address as the translated source ensures that traffic going
through the firewall will continue to flow in the event of a failover
from the master firewall to the backup firewall.
</p><p>
Double-click the NAT child object under the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>hq-fw-cluster</em></span> object to open the NAT table for editing. Just like in
the Policy rules, click the green + icon to add a new rule to the NAT
configuration.
</p><p>
Drag and drop the Internal LAN object from the object tree to the
Original Src field of the NAT rule, and then drag and drop the eth0
&ldquo;cluster-outside&rdquo; interface from the lj-fw-cluster object to the
Translated Src field. The final NAT rule should look like Figure 8.

Deploying the Rules to the Cluster</h2></div></div><p>
The final step in the process is generating the firewall scripts and
installing them on the firewall cluster members. To keep the article
short, I'm using the root user to install the Firewall Builder-generated
firewall scripts on the firewall servers, but Firewall Builder also
supports using nonroot users with proper sudo rights. This is covered
in the on-line Users Guide.
</p><p>
Before you can install the rules on the cluster member, firewalls create
a directory called /etc/fw on both lj-fw-1 and lj-fw-2 servers. This is
the default location where Firewall Builder will install the generated
firewall script.
</p><p>
As previously mentioned, the process where Firewall Builder converts the
rules into a firewall script that will be run on the firewall is called
compiling the rules. To compile and use the built-in installer
to deploy the rules, click on the Install button at the top of Firewall
Builder to launch the install wizard.
</p><p>
Click the check box next to the cluster name, and make sure the Install
check boxes are selected for both lj-fw-1 and lj-fw-2. If there are any
errors in the configuration, the compiler will display these; otherwise,
you will see a dialog window (Figure 9) showing that the cluster
was compiled successfully. When the cluster is compiled, a firewall for
each member of the cluster is created and saved locally on the machine
where Firewall Builder is running.

</p></div></div><p>
Clicking Next on this window launches the installer dialog
window (Figure 10). Each firewall in the cluster will have its
own installer window. The installer uses SCP to transfer the firewall
script that was generated for the cluster member to the firewall. After
the firewall script is copied, Firewall Builder logs in using SSH
to run the script. The installer includes an option to run in verbose
mode, which displays each command as it is being run on the remote
firewall. After the install completes, a new installer appears
for lj-fw-2, and the same process is repeated.

This article just skims the surface of using Firewall Builder to
configure firewall clusters. You can find much more information in the
Firewall Builder Users Guide, including how to install custom policies
on an individual cluster member, which is available on-line at the
NetCitadel Web site.
