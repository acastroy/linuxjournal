The ability to install third-party libraries on Android offers developers the
freedom to customize and optimize for applications.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214a580.0x22422a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The Android platform quickly has become one of the most popular mobile
operating systems for both developers and end users. As such, security is a
high priority, but so is the sometimes-conflicting goal of minimizing
resource usage. By default, the Android platform uses OpenSSL to provide
Java developers with SSL functionality, but by using CyaSSL instead,
developers gain a smaller footprint as well as a faster SSL implementation.
</p><p>
The intent of this article is to provide insight and instruction on how to
install an alternative SSL provider on the Android platform, specifically
using CyaSSL as an example. After doing so, developers will have the option
of using CyaSSL for SSL functionality and will gain the advantages in size
and speed that an embedded SSL library offers. Users interested in
replacing other pre-installed libraries on Android or developers porting C
libraries over from other systems to Android also may find this information
useful as a recipe for their own development efforts.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214a580.0x22424b8"></a>
TLS and SSL in a Nutshell</h2></div></div><p>
TLS (Transport Layer Security) and its predecessor SSL (Secure Socket
Layer) are cryptographic protocols that provide security for communications
over networks. Originally created by Netscape, these protocols allow
client/server applications to create an encrypted link and ensure that all
traffic being sent and received is both private and secure.
</p><p>
TLS and SSL provide this secure layer through the use of public/private key
encryption, symmetric encryption, hashing and trusted
certificates. A
message (the pre-master secret for SSL/TLS) encrypted with a public key can
be decrypted only using the associated private key. The public key is
usually publicly available, allowing anyone with this key to encrypt a
message. Only the owner of that public key may decrypt the message once
encrypted with the associated private key. There are multiple cipher suites
that may be used by TLS and SSL to create a secure socket. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214a580.0x2242670"></a>
Java Security Provider Overview</h2></div></div><p>
The Java platform contains a set of security APIs (public key
infrastructure, authentication, secure communication and access control),
all of which are only interfaces defining a &ldquo;contract&rdquo; for provider
implementations to meet. This gives Java programmers the ability to use a
single API while allowing any desired implementation to be plugged in
underneath.
</p><p>
Under this architecture, multiple providers for a service may be installed
side by side. In the case of having multiple providers for a service, each
provider is given an order of priority in which it should be used by the
Java platform. By default, Java will use higher-priority providers first if
they offer the desired functionality.
</p><p>
The javax.net.ssl Java API package is responsible for supplying SSL
functionality to the Java platform. The diagram in Figure 1 gives a general
overview of how SSL providers&mdash;or more generally, providers&mdash;are organized
within the Java platform. Because Android is based heavily on the Java
framework and supports this provider design, we are able to install CyaSSL
as an SSL provider for Android.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10896f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The structure of the Java provider framework, showing
specifically the javax.net.ssl package and how individual providers are
&ldquo;plugged in&rdquo; to the provider framework.
</p></div></div><p>
Java security providers are listed and prioritized in a file named
java.security on OS X and Linux, or java.properties on the Android
platform. On Android, this file is located at
/libcore/security/src/main/java/java/security/security.properties. This
file is the primary configuration file for Java providers and will be key
in the CyaSSL installation process.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214a580.0x2242ae8"></a>
Preparing a Build Environment and Getting the Android Source</h2></div></div><p>
First, you need to set up the local build environment to accommodate for
the Android build system as well as download the Android platform source
code.
</p><p>
To build the Android source files, you should have either Linux or OS X
installed on your development machine. At the time of this writing, Windows is
not currently supported. Further, the most current version of OS X, Snow
Leopard, is not supported due to incompatibilities with Java 6. The
remainder of this article assumes that the operating system of choice
is 32-bit Linux. Because of the speed at which the Android platform
evolves, check the Android Developer Web site for the most current host
operating system support.
</p><p>
Instructions for setting up your local work environment for Android
development as well as instructions for getting the Android source code can
be found in the Android documentation titled &ldquo;Get Android Source
Code&rdquo;,
located on the Android Developer Web site. Before continuing, make sure you
are able to build the Android platform as is without modifications by
following the steps outlined on-line.
</p><p>
Working with and contributing to the Android platform is done through the
use of Git and Repo. In Android, Git is used for local operations, such as
local branching, commits, diffs and edits. Repo, on the other hand, is a
tool built by Google on top of Git. According to Google, &ldquo;Repo helps manage
the many Git repositories, does the uploads to the revision control system,
and automates parts of the Android development workflow. Repo is not meant
to replace Git, only to make it easier to work with Git in the context of
Android.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214a580.0x2242da8"></a>
The Android Emulator</h2></div></div><p>
To make testing and debugging modifications to the Android platform easier,
Google has created the Android emulator. This emulator is highly
customizable, allowing custom hardware configurations, providing a log
output, allowing shell access and much more.
</p><p>
Before using the emulator, you need to download it. It comes bundled with
the Android SDK. Once you download the SDK, you will find a variety of
tools in the &lt;Android-SDK&gt;/tools directory, where &lt;Android-SDK&gt; is the root
directory of the SDK. These tools will include the emulator and the Android
Debug Bridge (adb).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214a580.0x2242f08"></a>
SSL Provider Components Overview</h2></div></div><p>
The CyaSSL Java SSL provider is composed of two parts: the CyaSSL shared
library and the Java provider code. The provider code uses JNI (Java Native
Interface) to communicate between Java and the CyaSSL C library. The
Android platform is divided into several layers, which are shown in Figure
2. The two layers affected during the SSL provider installation are
the libraries and Android runtime layers. In order to continue, download
the CyaSSL Java SSL provider for Android from the yaSSL Web site. A download
also is offered for Linux and Mac, so make sure you download the provider
for Android.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10896f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Android Platform Layer Composition
</p></div></div><p>
CyaSSL is a C-language-based SSL library targeted for embedded and RTOS
environments, primarily because of its small size and speed. It supports
the industry standards up to the current TLS 1.2 level, is fully
functional and is optimized for embedded environments, making it an ideal
choice for Android. There are two main components of the CyaSSL SSL
provider: a shared library written in C and the SSL provider code, which
contains both Java and native code.
</p><p>
The CyaSSL shared library is compiled by the Android build system into the
shared library named libcyassl.so. This library contains all the
functions that would be found in the CyaSSL library on a regular desktop
installation and is the foundation of the CyaSSL Java SSL provider.
</p><p>
The shared library source files are found in the CyaSSL provider download
under the /external/cyassl directory.
</p><p>
The provider code uses JNI to communicate between Java and native C and C++
code. Because of this, there are two separate parts that need to be
installed: the Java code and the native C++ code. These source files are in
the provider download under the /libcore/yassl directory.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214a580.0x2243380"></a>
Installing the CyaSSL Shared Library</h2></div></div><p>
In this article, &lt;Android-Platform&gt; represents the Android platform source
root on the development machine. The Android platform has a monolithic
build system, meaning that the entire platform is built at once. Google has
built a custom build system for Android in which each component is required
to have an Android.mk file. This file is not a makefile by itself, but
instead ties the component into the overall build system.
</p><p>
Because we are installing a new library, we're going to create a new
folder for it under the /external directory in the Android platform. Most
third-party shared libraries being placed into the Android platform should
be installed under the /external directory. To do this, copy the cyassl
directory from src/external/cyassl of the CyaSSL provider download to the
/external directory of the Android platform. After copying, this folder
should be located at &lt;Android-Platform&gt;/external/cyassl.
</p><p>
These source files will be compiled into libcyassl.so by the Android build
system using the rules in the /external/cyassl/src/Android.mk file.
</p><p>
Open &lt;Android-Platform&gt;/build/core/prelink-linux-map.map, and add a new
entry for libcyassl.so under the heading <tt  ># libraries for specific apps or
temporary libraries</tt>. The prelink-linux-map.map file is for used for
providing addresses so that the loading of all registered libraries can be
done faster. It should look similar to the following (note that libraries
should be aligned on 1MB boundaries):

<pre     class="programlisting">
libcyassl.so  0x9C500000 # [~1M] for external/cyassl
</pre>
</p><p>
Open the file &lt;Android-Platform&gt;/dalvik/libnativehelper/Android.mk, and
add libcyassl.so to the shared_libraries list.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214a580.0x2243698"></a>
Installing the Java SSL Provider</h2></div></div><p>
Now that the shared library has been installed, it's time to install
the JNI provider code.
</p><p>
The existing SSL provider in Android (Apache Harmony using OpenSSL) is
located in the /libcore directory. The CyaSSL provider will be installed
there as well for consistency. To begin, copy the yassl directory from
src/libcore/yassl of the provider source to the /libcore directory of
the Android platform. This folder should now be located at
&lt;Android-Platform&gt;/libcore/yassl.
</p><p>
The CyaSSL SSL provider contains an initialization method (in the native
C++ code), which needs to be registered with the Android platform so that
the native methods can be registered with the Dalvik VM at runtime. Dalvik
is Android's modified version of the Java Virtual Machine. Unlike a desktop
Java installation, Dalvik handles JNI differently in that it requires a
function to be written (within the JNI code) to register explicitly every
native method that needs to be made available to the JVM. This method needs
to be added to libnativehelper's Register.c file. 
</p><p>
Open the file &lt;Android-Platform&gt;/dalvik/libnativehelper/Register.c, and add
the
<tt  >register_com_yassl_xnet_provider_jsse_NativeCrypto</tt> method under the
entry for the existing provider. When added, it should resemble the
following (note the existing Apache Harmony installation):

<pre     class="programlisting">
if (register_org_apache_harmony_xnet_provider_jsse_
&#8618;NativeCrypto(env) != 0)
      goto bail;
if (register_com_yassl_xnet_provider_jsse_
&#8618;NativeCrypto(env) != 0)
       goto bail;
</pre>
</p><p>
The configuration file for the Java provider framework is the
security.properties file. This will allow you to set CyaSSL as the
default SSL provider. Open the security.properties file
(&lt;Android-Platform&gt;/libcore/security/src/main/java/java/security/security.properties),
and make the following changes to configure the CyaSSL provider.
</p><p>
Add the following line above the default
<tt  >org.apache.harmony.xnet.provider.jsse.JSSEProvider</tt> provider. Note the
numbers beside each provider. These reflect the priority of the provider.
It might be necessary to renumber this list after inserting the new
provider:


<pre     class="programlisting">
security.provider.3=com.yassl.xnet.provider.jsse.JSSEProvider
</pre>
</p><p>
Change the <tt  >ssl.SocketFactory.provider</tt> entry to point to the new
CyaSSL Provider:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ssl.SocketFactory.provider=com.yassl.xnet.provider.jsse.
&#8618;SocketFactoryImpl
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214a580.0x2243c18"></a>
Testing Platform Modifications</h2></div></div><p>
At this point, the CyaSSL provider is fully installed into the Android
platform. You can move on to building and testing the platform with the new
provider installed. If no errors arise during the platform build, the
provider can be loaded into the emulator to make sure the platform runs
correctly with the new provider installed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214a580.0x223a5b0"></a>
Rebuilding the Android Platform</h2></div></div><p>
The build process can take a significant amount of time depending on the
build environment. All commands should be run from the Android platform
root:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ source build/envsetup.sh   [Sets environment variables]
$ lunch 1                    [Builds the emulator]
$ make                       [Builds the Android Platform]
</pre>
</p><p>
Keep in mind that it is possible to rebuild a single project (such as the
CyaSSL shared library) to test that the shared library builds correctly
using the <tt  >mm</tt> command (shown below), but before testing in the emulator, a
full platform build needs to be done:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd external/cyassl
$ mm
</pre>
</p><p>
The Android platform build process results in three image files:
&lt;Android-Platform&gt;/out/target/product/generic/ramdisk.img,
&lt;Android-Platform&gt;/out/target/product/generic/system.img and
&lt;Android-Platform&gt;/out/target/product/generic/userdata.img:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
ramdisk.img &mdash; a small partition that is mounted as read-only by the kernel
at boot time. It contains only /init and a few configuration files. It is
used to start /init, which will boot the rest of the system images and run
the init procedure.
</p></li><li><p>
system.img &mdash; a partition image that will be mounted as / and contains all
system binaries. This is the image file that contains all of the changes
that were made above.
</p></li><li><p>
userdata.img &mdash; this image is used only when the -wipe-data option is used
with the emulator. In a normal emulator execution, a default userdata image
will be used.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Of these, system.img is of the highest concern. It contains the majority of
the system and all of the changes that have been made with the addition of
the CyaSSL SSL provider.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214a580.0x223ab88"></a>
Emulator Execution</h2></div></div><p>
Before you can use the Android Emulator, you must create an Android Virtual
Device. Android Virtual Devices are configurations of emulator options that
allow developers to model a physical Android device better. They hold
configuration information, such as a hardware profile, a mapping to a system
image and a dedicated storage area. To create an Android Virtual Device,
the android application is used. This application is found under the
tools directory of the SDK. Create a new Virtual Device using the following
command (issued from the SDK /tools directory):


<pre     class="programlisting">

$ android create avd -n &lt;desired-name&gt; -t &lt;target-version&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214a580.0x223ad98"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where &lt;desired-name&gt; is the name of the Android Virtual Device and
&lt;target-version&gt; is the desired target platform. Run the following command
to view available targets:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ android list targets
</pre>
</p><p>
After the Android Virtual Device has been created, load the emulator with
the built images:


<pre     class="programlisting">

$ emulator -avd &lt;virtual-device-name&gt; -system
&lt;Android-Platform&gt;/out/target/product/generic/system.img -data
&lt;Android-Platform&gt;/out/target/product/generic/userdata.img -ramdisk
&lt;Android-Platform&gt;/out/target/product/generic/ramdisk.img

</pre>
</p><p>
There are other useful emulator options that may be added to the above
command. A few are listed below, but for a complete list see the official
Android Emulator Web page:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >-verbose</tt> &mdash; verbose output.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-nocache</tt> &mdash; don't use a cache.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-show-kernel</tt> &mdash; print kernel messages to the
terminal window.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Once the emulator is running, the logcat output can be viewed in a new
terminal window (assuming the current directory is &lt;Android-SDK&gt;/tools):

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ adb logcat
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214a580.0x223b478"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
In this article, installing an alternative SSL provider into the Android
platform is explained using CyaSSL. By using CyaSSL in the Android
platform instead of OpenSSL, developers are able to leverage both the speed
and size advantages of the CyaSSL library. Making use of both a shared
library and JNI, the same general process could apply to installing other
third-party libraries into the Android platform and could provide a good
reference for developers moving C libraries over to Android from other
operating environments.
