How much Linux do you get with Chrome OS?

I was fortunate enough to receive one of the Google Cr-48
&ldquo;Mario&rdquo;
Chrome OS notebooks to test. My day job is technical writer and
sysadmin for Monty Program, the company behind MariaDB, so the two
main questions I wanted to answer about this stripped-down operating
system were:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Can I use it for my normal work tasks?
</p></li><li><p>
Chrome OS runs on top of a Linux kernel, but how much of the normal Linux
experience do you get?
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The notebook itself is well built and attractive, but not exceptional. The
keyboard has a nice feel to it and a good layout, apart from the
tiny up/down arrow keys. The battery life is excellent&mdash;easily the best
I've experienced on a laptop.

Caps Lock.
</p></div></div><p>
Chrome OS itself is not surprising, at least if you're familiar with
the Chrome Web browser. There are a few extra configuration options,
like setting the trackpad sensitivity, and network settings. But, the amount
of customization you can do is minimal. An example of this minimization
is with user accounts&mdash;there aren't any, at least in the traditional
sense. You actually are running as the &ldquo;chronos&rdquo; user, but you
never log in as that user. Instead, you log in using your Google
account credentials.
</p><p>
When you first sign in, Chrome OS looks to see if you are signed up
with the Chrome browser synchronization service, and if so, it syncs
all the items you have selected for syncing (bookmarks, extensions and so
on). A couple minutes after booting Chrome OS the first
time, my favorite Chrome extensions had been downloaded and installed
automatically, and all of my bookmarks imported. I had to configure the
extensions, but doing so didn't take much time.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11004f3.large.jpg"><img src="11004f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. On first boot, Chrome OS helpfully provides you with a
short tutorial.
</p></div></div><p>
My desktop Chrome environment was replicated with almost no effort on
my part, so it was time to start looking under the covers to see what I
could find. And, what I found was...not much. There's really nothing
beyond the browser to Chrome OS. Okay, there's one thing. By default, the
Cr-48 comes with crosh, the Chrome OS shell. You can access this shell 
with the Ctrl-Alt-t key combination.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11004f4.large.jpg"><img src="11004f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Pressing Ctrl-Alt-? brings up a handy keyboard diagram
showing what keys do what. Here I'm viewing the Ctrl key
combinations.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11004f5.large.jpg"><img src="11004f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. There's not much to configure in Chrome OS.
</p></div></div><p>
Crosh is very limited, but that's by design. It's not meant as
a full command-line interface. It allows you to run only certain,
specific commands. You can get the list of commands with the
<tt  >help</tt>
command. The full list, with instructions for each command, is only
one screen of text. There's ping, SSH, a traceroute command, route,
top, a couple commands for managing corporate SSL certificates, some
networking diagnostic and logging commands, and that's it. A few were
unfamiliar to me, but the output of the help command explains them in
sufficient detail. My guess is the crosh console interface mainly exists
to provide support techs or a help desk the ability to troubleshoot your
Chrome OS device over the phone or in person.
</p><p>
The commands are not very useful for daily work. Even the one command
I normally find very convenient, SSH, is not. It's not OpenSSH for
one thing. It's more like a wrapper script for people who don't know how
to use SSH and can't be bothered to take five minutes
to learn it. For example, when using this crippled crosh SSH, you can't
enter <tt  >ssh me@example.com</tt>. Instead, you need to use
<tt  >ssh me
example.com</tt>. There also is no way to use SSH keys. The funny thing
is, OpenSSH is installed on Chrome OS, but to use it, you need to get into
&ldquo;developer&rdquo; mode.
</p><p>
Switching to developer mode turns off the hardware verification system,
which prevents the running of modified firmware. To get into developer
mode, you remove the battery and slide a small switch hidden under a
piece of tape. The reason for using a physical switch is because you
can't prevent physical attacks anyway, so you might as well make
running modified software require physical access&mdash;at least that way
you shut down remote attacks (there's obviously no way to slide
the physical switch remotely). Full instructions for the procedure, with photos,
are found on <a href="http://www.chromium.org" target="_self">www.chromium.org</a>.
</p><p>
The first time you boot in to developer mode, the notebook resets itself
to factory settings and displays a warning. In Chrome OS, this means you
need to set up your network connection, and you need to download and
install your extensions 
again. Apart from those two things,
nothing else is stored on the notebook, so it's an easy procedure, especially
because the extension part happens automatically in the background.
</p><p>
When in developer mode, the warning screen appears every time you
boot. It's more of an annoyance than anything else. A simple Ctrl-d
dismisses it and continues the boot process. The upside to the annoyance is
that there is no possible way for you to not know your Chrome OS device
is in developer mode.
</p><p>
Developer mode adds a new &ldquo;shell&rdquo; command to crosh. This command
starts a bash shell&mdash;GNU bash, version 4.0.35(2)-release for those of
you keeping score. But, just because you have a bash shell doesn't
mean you have a complete command-line environment. For one thing, although
some programs are installed, there's no vi/vim/ed/nano/pico or
other command-line text editor present. So, Chrome OS has this strange
command-line environment where you can use <tt  >more</tt> to view the contents
of a file; <tt  >wc</tt> to count the number of characters, lines and words
in the file; and even <tt  >md5sum</tt> to generate a hash; but
you can't
actually edit the file. What were they thinking?
</p><p>
That's a rhetorical question. The answer is &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo;. In
a clouded world, why enable editing files when there is no network
connection? Why would you do that? My answer is because the cloud is
not reliably available at all times everywhere, and because, gosh darn
it, I like editing files locally in vim. I like it so much, I even use
an extension in Chrome that allows me to use vim to edit text areas in
Web forms (it comes in very handy for long Knowledgebase articles).
</p><p>
At my house, an Internet connection is almost a given, likewise around
town (mostly). But when traveling, it's a crap-shoot. It depends on
where I am (and sometimes when). The Verizon cell radio in the Cr-48
makes for decent coverage in the United States, but connecting in Europe
and other areas of the world is via Wi-Fi or not at all. Most of the
time, having a laptop that requires an Internet connection is okay, but
sometimes it's not. For example, when using the Cr-48 on a plane, should I
even bother turning it on? If the plane has Wi-Fi and there's something
that justifies the cost, sure; otherwise, no. I might as well put it
in my checked luggage.
</p><p>
The Cr-48 is, of course, just a prototype device. When several different
Chrome OS devices are available commercially, you'll be able to choose
the one that gives you the most reliable always-available connection for
your area and travel habits. The reliance on an always-available Internet
connection is an Achilles heel, but one that eventually will be fixed or
minimized. The good news is that when I do have a connection, I actually
am able to do most of my day-to-day work using nothing but a browser and SSH.
</p><p>
Being able to get by with nothing but a browser and terminal will, of
course, not be true for everyone. I happen to spend my workday writing
(blogs, wiki and Knowledgebase entries, e-mail and IRC for the most
part), editing what others have written, and maintaining a small group of
servers. A good text editor and SSH, therefore, are the two most important
things to me, followed by good IRC and e-mail clients.
</p><p>
When I said before that no text editor was included, I was being only
partially accurate. Google doesn't leave you completely high and dry.
One of the Chrome OS &ldquo;applications&rdquo; installed by default is a simple
rich text editor called Scratchpad. Scratchpad saves a copy of all
text locally on the Cr-48 and syncs with Google Docs. In Google Docs,
synced documents show up in a folder called Scratchpad. Any
existing text documents you place in that folder also show up in
Scratchpad when you next sync. As might be expected, nontext documents
(spreadsheets, presentations and so on) are not supported by Scratchpad
and do not show up, even if you place them in that folder.
</p><p>
The only issue I have with using Scratchpad is that it's not a good
editor. It's quicker and more convenient than using Google Docs, but
as a text editor, it is merely passable&mdash;nowhere near as efficient or
useful as a true text editor. To be fair, the trade-off in efficiency is
partly made up for with ubiquity. It's nice knowing the document 
always will be only a click away in any decent Web browser on any computer
anywhere in the world.
</p><p>
After text editing, the next biggest things I do are IRC and
e-mail&mdash;neither of which I can do natively on Chrome OS. Yes, Gmail is there
and works wonderfully (along with all other Web-based e-mail sites),
but my work e-mail does not have a Web front end. Hopefully, 
developers are working on a solid IMAP client for Chrome OS. Ditto on a good
IRC client. Thank goodness Mutt and Irssi are perfectly usable over
an SSH connection (so is vim for that matter), because without them, I
would be unable even to consider using Chrome OS full-time. The downside
to running them remotely is that when the network to which I'm connected 
is slow or unreliable, it quickly becomes difficult to get anything
done. Finally, even though in developer mode I can use OpenSSH (hooray
for SSH keys!), the experience is not as good as when using a
&ldquo;real&rdquo;
Linux command line.
</p><p>
Currently, the only way to get vim or any other native apps not included
by default is to compile your own build of Chrome OS and/or your own
packages. For developers, this will be fine, but I'm not a developer. For
me, it would be nice if there were some sort of simple package manager,
even if it contained only a limited selection of preapproved native
applications.
</p><p>
Lack of common Linux applications aside, Chrome OS is very stable, and the
hardware and software work well together. Sleep, resume, the Webcam
and so on all work very well. That said, I was able to make Chrome OS
crash, or at least freeze temporarily, on some pages with embedded Adobe
Flash content and when playing a game I installed from the Chrome Web
Store (I'm not sure if the game was using Flash or if it was an HTML5
Web app). On most of these occasions, the OS was able to recover without
my help after a minute or so (no reboot required), but one time
it wouldn't or couldn't recover, and I was forced to hold the
power button to force a reboot. Thankfully, booting Chrome OS is very
fast&mdash;about 20 seconds in my tests from opening the lid to the first tab loading
after login. Yes, the Cr-48 boots when you open it&mdash;a nice touch.
</p><p>
Another nice touch is the Search, or &ldquo;new tab key&rdquo;, as I refer to
it. This key replaces the Caps Lock key (you can configure it to be
the Caps Lock key in the system preferences, if you want). Pressing
it opens a new tab with the cursor in the Chrome search/address bar,
so you can press it and begin typing out your search or the URI you want
to go to immediately. The keys that normally would be function keys 
also have been assigned to specific browser and system-related actions, such
as forward, back, reload, full-screen, volume, screen brightness and
so forth. The whole experience is very polished, and it should be.
I mean, there's really only one application you're running, so it
would be surprising if the hardware wasn't tuned for it.
</p><p>
So, how much Linux do you get with Chrome OS? Not much, apart from
SSH. Of course, Linux is very much behind the scenes, but all in
inaccessible-to-normal-users ways. Some command-line
applications are included, but not enough to consider the Chrome OS
command line useful. By way of comparison, the Ben NanoNote's command line 
(which I reviewed in the October 2010 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>) is much more useful,
even though it has no network connection. Unless you are a developer,
customizing Chrome OS doesn't go far beyond superficial things like
bookmarks, extensions and browser themes.
</p><p>
Superficial or not, the fact remains that thanks to SSH, I can use this
notebook to perform most of my work-related tasks&mdash;most, but not all.
And,
even with the many tasks I can perform, unless they are tasks 
for which I normally use a Web browser, I can't do them as easily as on my
regular Ubuntu-powered Linux system. This is partly related to long-term
habits I have, and partly because a good, dedicated application often
is better than a Web-based work-alike (for example, a Web-based image editor
compared to The GIMP).
</p><p>
As an example, I regularly use ClusterSSH to log in to large portions of
our servers simultaneously to perform maintenance. The screen size of
the Cr-48 is large enough, in theory, to have six or more simultaneous
SSH windows open and visible, but this simply is not possible on Chrome OS
unless you are a developer and compile ClusterSSH (if it's even possible
to do so) or code from scratch a work-alike replacement solution. I
still can upgrade all six of the servers that need it, but I have to
log in and upgrade each of them separately.
</p><p>
In the end, Chrome OS is a no-fuss browser-only operating system. If you
truly can or do use a browser for everything you do on a computer (or even
almost everything), this is the perfect way to do it. There aren't any
configuration issues, because there's nothing to configure beyond logging
in to your Google account. There aren't any maintenance issues, because
Google handles that for you behind the scenes, updating you to the newest
version of Chrome OS automatically. There aren't any data-loss issues,
because it doesn't store anything that isn't also stored somewhere
else or that cannot be easily re-installed. I could go on, but there's
not much else to say. For better or for worse, Chrome OS contains just
enough Linux to run the Chrome Web browser, and that's it.
</p><p>
Similar to the situation a couple years ago when I gave my Dell Netbook
to my daughter, I don't think I will use this notebook as my primary
one. It's not because the keyboard is too small (my main complaint about the
Dell Netbook). The keyboard on the Cr-48 is excellent. And, it's not because of
anything else hardware-related (it's an attractive, well-built notebook),
but because it cannot do some of the things I expect and need a portable
computer to do. I may take it on trips as a backup machine, but I think
this notebook will end up more or less belonging to my wife. Most of what
she does on her desktop computer is, or easily can be done inside a Web
browser. For her, this is the perfect notebook; it's easy to use, stable and
secure. In fact, it's been one of the very few gadgets I've owned
that she keeps borrowing. Chrome OS may not be for everyone, but Google
is on to something here.
