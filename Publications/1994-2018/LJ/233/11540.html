Re: SIGALRM Timers and Stdin Analysis</h4><p>
In Dave Taylor's &ldquo;SIGALRM Timers and Stdin Analysis&rdquo; article in the
November 2012 issue, he was using <tt  >ps</tt> to check to see
whether a process
was running before sending a signal for termination, as in the snippet
below:


<pre     class="programlisting">

ps $$ &gt; /dev/null
if [ ! $? ] ; then
  kill -ALRM $$
fi

</pre>
</p><p>
As an alternative to <tt  >ps ...</tt>, he might want to use
<tt  >kill -0 $$</tt>. The <tt  >-0</tt>
option is designed to give an exit code that shows whether a signal can be
sent.
</p><p>
I learned this from some good folks I used to work with.
Thanks for the article.

My Facebook</h4><p>
I have been doing some research on Facebook and found that it can be run
on CentOS with PHP.
</p><p>
That said, I thought I would start my own Facebook, and I saw this and thought
you might like to do an article on it:

Fascinating, Jeffrey. Perhaps individual social-networking platforms are the
next big thing. With a common back end for users (like gravatar even), I could
see it working.&mdash;Shawn Powers

Why I Let My Subscription Lapse and Won't Ever Re-subscribe</h4><p>
It took my desktop computer longer than 0 seconds to render a page with an
ad&mdash;closer to a minute, I think.
</p><p>
The opportunity cost to read your magazine in PDF is too high, even if it is
free.

Andrew Snyder  <br><br>

Sorry you're having a difficult time with ads, Andrew. Although advertising
&ldquo;keeps
the lights on&rdquo;, we try to select only vendors that will be of interest to our
readers.&mdash;Ed.

I Will Renew</h4><p>
Thanks to Shawn Powers for the humor and info.
I've been a reader since March 1994, and I will continue with the digital
subscription in no small part due to his tongue-in-cheek approach.

I Like the Way You Write</h4><p>
Shawn,
I'm writing regular tips-and-tricks articles for Linux, etc., for a
blog (<a href="http://tipstricks.itmatrix.eu" target="_self">tipstricks.itmatrix.eu</a>). I do it the very dry way, and after
reading Shawn Powers' &ldquo;Taming Tomcat&rdquo; article in the July 2013
issue, I was delighted by the simple and
nice way he wrote it.
</p><p>
Thanks for the contribution. If you ever want to write on any of the
subjects I wrote about in the blog, be my guest. I have put no restrictions on
the use of this material.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Michel Bisson  <br><br>
</p><p>
Aw, shucks. It's the month for making me feel shiny about my writing, I guess. It
was my birthday recently, so I'll take your letter as an awesome gift. Thank you
very much.&mdash;Shawn Powers
</p><a name="N0x22b9580.0x23b26f0"></a><h4 class="title"><a name="N0x22b9580.0x23b26f0"></a>
Sleep Patterns</h4><p>
The graph of Shawn Powers' sleep patterns looks a lot like mine did, until I
realized that I probably entrain to artificial light [see Shawn's &ldquo;Sleep
as Android&rdquo; article in the Upfront section of the July 2013 issue]. In other words,
my brain misinterprets artificial light as sunlight, so it doesn't
think it's nighttime even after the sun has set, and so it doesn't prepare
my body's physiology for sleep. Those changes take a while (an hour or
two), so when I turned out the lights, I tossed and turned for an
hour or two until my body adjusted to the darkness.
</p><p>
As it turns out, this is all due to the presence of retinal neurons
that function to detect a narrow range of blue light (sky blue, in
fact). Their job is to inform the brain when they no longer detect
that light (that is, when night has fallen). However, in some individuals,
these cells see enough blue light in the artificial light spectrum to
fool them into thinking the sun is still up (computer screens
and TVs emit <span   class="emphasis"><em>a lot</em></span> of light in this blue range). I'm not sure why
this happens in some individuals and not others, but I wonder if it
might have to do with eye color (I have blue eyes).
</p><p>
In any event, it's easy to use glasses to filter out this narrow range
of blue light, thereby plunging the relevant retinal neurons into
&ldquo;darkness&rdquo;. Individuals with this problem would don the glasses for
1&ndash;2 hours before they wish to retire; after a couple hours, sleep
then (in my experience) comes easily and naturally, and much less
fitfully.
</p><p>
I bought a pair of these glasses from <a href="http://www.lowbluelights.com" target="_self">www.lowbluelights.com</a>, and my
sleep patterns have improved enormously. The effects have lasted long
enough (about a year) to rule out any significant placebo effect. You
might want to give them a try (I have no association whatsoever with
this company, except as a satisfied customer).

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Chris Brandon  <br><br>
</p><p>
Whoa, that's fascinating. I have bluish-grey eyes as well. (Again, this might be
anecdotal, but it's still interesting.) I'll have to try that out. Thanks for the
info!&mdash;Shawn Powers

DevOps</h4><p>
Tracy Ragan's opinion piece &ldquo;21st-Century DevOps&mdash;an End to the
20th-Century Practice of Writing Static Build and Deploy Scripts&rdquo; in the
June 2013 issue told us repeatedly that she doesn't hold with
scripts. She hints once or twice that a model-driven approach would be better; it would
have been great if she'd told us how that would work!

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
S.   <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Tracy Ragan replies:</b></span>
Defining how a DevOps Model-Driven Framework is implemented is a complete
article in itself that cannot be answered easily in a few short sentences.
However, there are solid examples in both the commercial and open-source
markets that have model-driven solutions that are worth looking into. Take
a look at how Chef from Opscode uses &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; for defining
standard server configurations. On the build management side, take a look
at Meister from OpenMake Software and how it uses &ldquo;Build Services&rdquo;
for creating standard models for compiling more than 200 different languages.
In the deployment world, CA Release Automation (previously Nolio) uses
standard models for performing application-level deployments, similar to
IBM's Rational Application Framework for managing Websphere deploys.
</p><p>
In essence, to deliver a Model-Driven Framework, you establish solutions
and processes that can separate the build, test or deploy logic from the
&ldquo;hard-coded&rdquo; references to filenames, directories and so on. That
information is delivered through manifest files, target files or other
containers, which are then passed into the logic. In other words, the
&ldquo;how&rdquo; and &ldquo;what&rdquo; are kept apart until an action needs to
occur. You may end up with many files containing the &ldquo;what&rdquo;, but
only a few containers that include the &ldquo;how&rdquo;. The logic thereby
becomes reusable and easily managed. By having only a few containers that
manage the &ldquo;how&rdquo;, you end up with a highly repeatable and
transparent process for moving code from development to production with the
ability of reporting on details that scripts cannot produce. Thanks for
the feedback.

Electronic Vs. Paper</h4><p>
So, it has been some time since you guys have done a paper copy of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>.
</p><p>
Up until the time you stopped printing <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, I had read every issue since issue 1, usually
within a month or two of it coming out.
</p><p>
Now that you have gone digital, I am now well over a year behind. So, clearly reading
stuff on a tablet or otherwise for me doesn't work. I do it for smaller articles, but
not for something the size of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>.
</p><p>
You seriously need to consider a paper copy again&mdash;there are those of us who would
happily pay more for a paper copy. You could do it in a limited run at a break-even or
slightly higher cost production.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Nuts and Volts</em></span> magazine has figured out how to do this, so why can't you?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Jeff Regan  <br><br>
</p><p>
It hasn't come up in a while, Jeff, but thanks for letting us know your
struggle. I'm not sure how <span   class="emphasis"><em>Nuts and Volts</em></span> does it, but it's something we can look
into for sure. I do worry the price might be painful, but some folks might be
willing to pay the premium I suppose. At the very least, it might be worth
looking into print-on-demand options. I will do some research and see what I can come
up with.&mdash;Ed.

Using a Chromebook for Development</h4><p>
I just got an Acer C7 Chromebook as a replacement for a laptop that recently
decided to work no more.
</p><p>
It has great hardware specs for its price with no Microsoft tax, but
unfortunately, the software is not suitable for development.
The first thing I did was install Crouton to install Ubuntu. Great! But
several packages are needed to be installed to make it a development
machine.
</p><p>
Later I found Nitrous. It provides you a virtual 8-core Linux box running
Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS and your choice of development languages and frameworks
(RoR, Python, DJango, Ruby and node.js at the moment). You also can connect
your box to GitHub.
</p><p>
Best of all, besides being free, you get a decent Web IDE. Shell access 
also is provided either by SSH or directly with the IDE.
</p><p>
You can join Nitrous for free at <a href="https://www.nitrous.io" target="_self">https://www.nitrous.io</a>.
</p><p>
Keep up the good work!

Cool! Moving the development side of things to the Web is a step that I haven't
considered, nor have I seen it done before. Thanks for the great tip. Perhaps my
wife will let me get the Chromebook Pixel now&mdash;you know, for research
purposes!&mdash;Shawn Powers

Variant of Shell Timeout</h4><p>
Something I had to work out was having a way to timeout a command executed
within a shell script (not the whole shell script itself). I had the case
where an <tt  >ssh</tt> to a box would connect, but the command
never ran
because of a
problem on the box. It just hung my whole script. So, I wrapped the
<tt  >ssh</tt> in
this function that allows me to kill the <tt  >ssh</tt> if it goes
too
long:


<pre     class="programlisting">

function run_with_command () {
   CMD=$1
   TIMEOUT=$2
   COUNTER=0

   ${CMD} &amp;
   CMD_PID=$!

   while ps $CMD_PID &gt; /dev/null &amp;&amp; [ $COUNTER -lt $TIMEOUT ]; do
      sleep 1
      COUNTER=$((COUNTER+1))
   done

   if [ $COUNTER -eq $TIMEOUT ]; then
      kill $CMD_PID 2&gt;/dev/null
   fi

   wait $CMD_PID 2&gt;/dev/null
}

# TEST
run_with_command "sleep 20"  10     # this will timeout
run_with_command "sleep 10"  20     # this will not timeout

# If I want the result from the command, then I do this
result=$(run_with_command "ssh box1 hostname" 10 )

</pre>
</p><p>
The wait makes sure the return code of the function is provided to
know if it ran successfully. If it was killed, it will return 143. If it
ran, I'll get 0.
