development.

A few months ago, I was walking with my seven-year-old son, and I mentioned
that when I was young, we had computers in the house. I pointed out
that while I was growing up, we didn't have an Internet connection, and
that the Web hadn't even been invented yet. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; he asked,
confused. &ldquo;So what did you do with the computer?&rdquo;
</p><p>
The Web has permeated our lives to such a large degree, it's easy
to understand why my son is unable to comprehend what it would mean to
be in a world without it. The notion of a computer without
Internet access today is quite strange; I have given a number of
lectures in military and otherwise-restricted areas where Internet
access is strictly forbidden, and let me tell you, there's something
accurate about the way in which Internet access is described as an
addictive drug. If I can't get my fix of e-mail, or blogs, or
newspapers or Hacker News, I feel cut off from the rest of the
world.
</p><p>
This is, according to my count, my 201st At the Forge column. It is
also, somewhat coincidentally, a bit more than 20 years since I
started writing Web applications. So, I'd like to take the
opportunity to look at where Web technologies have come from, and
where they're going&mdash;and to wax a bit nostalgic for the days when
the Web was still the great unknown, something that we knew
would one day be a part of everyone's lives, but that we couldn't
express beyond those basic thoughts.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a56580.0x2b4e6c8"></a>
In the Beginning</h2></div></div><p>
In the beginning, of course, the Web was static. It took a while for
people to realize that just because a Web browser was requesting a
document didn't mean that the server actually needed to send the
contents of a document. Instead, the server could lie to the browser,
creating a document on the fly, by executing a program. This sort of
thing, which Web developers do every day, remains one of the funniest
parts of the Web from my perspective&mdash;that browsers ask for the
contents of a URL, as if they're asking for something static, without
any way of knowing whether the server is creating something new for
them or sending the same data everyone else received.
</p><p>
Back in those early days, it wasn't entirely obvious just what
technologies people were going to use to implement their Web
applications. Those of you who have seen, or used, programs in a
&ldquo;cgi-bin&rdquo; directory might remember CGI, the API that standardized the
way Web servers could invoke external programs. You might
not remember that the cgi-bin directory was where the compiled C
programs would go. Yes, the demonstration CGI programs that came with
the NCSA HTTP server were written in C and shell. It took a little
while before people discovered that higher-level languages&mdash;mostly
Perl and Tcl in those days&mdash;could do the job just as easily, while
allowing programmers to be far more productive.
</p><p>
And, although Tim Berners-Lee called it the World Wide Web, usage was far
from universal in those early days. When we put MIT's student
newspaper on the Web in 1993, almost no one, even among our
readership, knew what a Web browser was. We had to take out
advertisements in our own newspaper, telling people how to install the
Mosaic browser, so they could read the newspaper on-line. And of
course, the look and feel of the newspaper in those days was extremely
primitive. A paper we submitted to the first-ever World Wide Web
conference described how we had made it possible for people to search
through our newspaper's archives&mdash;an amazing breakthrough in those
days!
</p><p>
Although it quickly became clear that the Web was becoming dynamic, no
one really thought about it as serious software development. I
remember expressing surprise, in 1995, when I was given a business
card that said &ldquo;Web application developer&rdquo; on it. 
While the Web was becoming dynamic, no one thought of Web development
as serious software work. 
I snickered a bit to myself, because it seemed clear to me
that applications were serious desktop software&mdash;not the toys 
that we were creating.
</p><p>
But it was in that year, 1995, that I began to understand where the
Web was headed. It was then that I learned about relational databases
and began to understand just how powerful Web applications could be
when connected to a powerful, flexible system for storing and
retrieving data. It also was in that year that the Java and
JavaScript languages were unveiled, tantalizing Web developers with
the idea that we could have things happen inside the browser beyond
simple text and images.
</p><p>
It was then that we began to imagine that the browser could be the
beginning of a new platform for applications. Of course, when Marc
Andreessen, then best known as author of Mosaic and a cofounder of
Netscape, said things like that, we all laughed, wondering how the Web
could turn into a platform for application development. But of
course, that vision has turned into a reality. Desktop software
hasn't disappeared entirely, but increasingly large categories of
software are being pushed onto the Web, accessed through our browsers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a56580.0x2b4eae8"></a>
Libraries and Frameworks</h2></div></div><p>
It didn't take long before Web development really began to take off.
Suddenly, the big thing was to have &ldquo;a Web page&rdquo; or even an entire
site. The growth of the Web happened at about the same time that the
term &ldquo;open source&rdquo; was coined, giving publicity and ammunition to the
techies who wanted to rely on software such as Linux and Perl to run
their systems. (It took a long time before some of my clients were
convinced that running a Web server on Linux was a safe choice, or
that it could handle the dozens of users who would visit their site in
a given day.)
</p><p>
I don't think that it's a coincidence that open source and the Web
grew together. Open-source operating systems and languages&mdash;in those
days, Perl, Python and PHP&mdash;grew in popularity, both because they
were free of charge and because they offered enormous numbers of
standardized, debugged and highly useful libraries. CGI.pm became an
enormously popular Perl module, because it made so much of Web
development easy.
</p><p>
On the database side, things also were starting to improve: MySQL,
which had been free of charge (but commercially licensed), was released
under the GPL, and it was soon ubiquitous on the Web servers that you
could license by the month or year. PostgreSQL also emerged on the
scene and overcame the 8 kilobyte-per-row limit that had hobbled it
for so long. Suddenly, you could get a full-fledged relational
database sitting behind your application, using libraries that were
fast, efficient and full of features.
</p><p>
Web technologies themselves were becoming more sophisticated as well.
The standards for HTTP, CSS and HTML were formalized and then grew
to handle such things as caching. The W3C, formed to create and
encourage standards for Web-related technologies, produced XML, a
document format that remains pervasive in the computer world.
</p><p>
It was, on the one hand, easier to create sophisticated Web
applications than ever before. But on the other hand, it was no
longer possible to learn everything you needed to know about Web
development in a few days or weeks. It was becoming a specialized set
of skills, with people specializing in particular subsets. No longer
did &ldquo;Webmaster&rdquo; refer to someone who knew everything about all parts
of Web technologies. You didn't yet hear about &ldquo;front-end&rdquo; or even
&ldquo;full-stack&rdquo; Web developers. But you did have people who were
specializing in particular languages, servers, databases and even (to
some degree) in Web design, helping ensure that sites were both
aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.
</p><p>
All of this meant that Web development was becoming serious, and the
individual libraries, such as CGI.pm, were no longer enough. Web
developers started to use frameworks instead of libraries. I once
heard someone distinguish libraries from frameworks by saying that a
library is something you add to your code, whereas a framework is
something to which you add your code. Given the number of things
a Web developer increasingly was having to worry about&mdash;user
sessions, database connections, cookie persistence and caching&mdash;it
shouldn't come as a surprise that the frameworks started to become
increasingly serious, complex and sophisticated. Many (but not all)
of these frameworks were released as open-source software, allowing
developers to create complete, stem-to-stern Web applications using
software that was inexpensive, robust and scalable, as well as
written by the same people who used it.
</p><p>
Even Java got into the act. Although it took years for Java to be
released under an open-source license, server-side Java has been
around for some time and has gone through many incarnations. From
the initial rollouts of servlets and JSP pages, to Java beans and
Enterprise Java Beans, to the dozens of standards and open-source
projects that have grown up in the Java world, the language that was
originally designed to run applets in our browsers suddenly was a
powerhouse to contend with.
</p><p>
And yet, Java, which was introduced as a simpler alternative to C++,
without all the overhead and problems associated with that
language, frustrated many with its large numbers of configuration
files, protocols and Java-centric words and libraries. Out of this
frustration (to some degree, at least) came the first of a new
generation of Web frameworks, Ruby on Rails (written in Ruby) and
Django (written in Python). Both Rails and Django promised developers
something that hadn't yet existed, namely the ability to write
sophisticated Web applications, but without the enormous overhead and
bloat that Java-based systems required. Not surprisingly, both were
instant hits, and they managed to hook a new generation of Web developers,
as well as pull many (myself included) away from other, older, less-sophisticated frameworks that we had been using until then.
</p><p>
Now I do most of my work in Ruby on Rails, and I continue to enjoy
working with this framework every day. But even the biggest
enthusiasts among us need to remember that Rails is nearly ten years
old at this point. It hasn't reached the level of bloat and
bureaucracy that we see in the Java world, but at the same time, we
see that many other language communities have produced their own
versions of Rails, using many of the ideas that were pioneered there.
Moreover, as Rails has matured, it has needed to consider legacy
software and offer developers ways to integrate Rails apps into an
existing infrastructure. As a result, we've seen that the small,
scrappy framework is now getting larger, a bit more bloated and
certainly harder to learn than was the case when I first learned about
it back in 2005.

Components, APIs and Browsers</h2></div></div><p>
Where does that leave us today? First, the news is all good,
in that there never has been a better time to be a Web developer. The
opportunities to learn, explore, extend, implement and use Web-based
technologies already are overwhelming and seemingly limitless, and
every day appears to bring new frameworks, libraries and techniques
that make Web applications even more interactive and compelling than
already was the case.
</p><p>
And yet, for all of the opportunities, Web development never has been
more difficult to get into, simply because of the many technologies
you need to master in order to create a Web application. Web
development, as Philip Greenspun said so many years ago, requires that
you be a generalist, understanding a little about a large number of
different technologies. A modern Web developer needs to understand
HTTP, HTML and CSS, at least one server-side language, SQL and
JavaScript. It also helps a lot to know how to work with Linux or
other server operating systems.
</p><p>
The reality also is that even the most experienced Web developers are
starting to specialize. True, I think of myself as what's
increasingly called a &ldquo;full-stack Web developer&rdquo;, understanding
everything from server configuration to database optimization to
JavaScript programming, but the march toward specialization
continues, and I've seen that a growing number of jobs are aimed at
people with expertise on the back end or the front end, without much
overlap between the two. Configuration and deployment also
are becoming their own specialties, as we've seen with the rise of devops
during the last few years.
</p><p>
That said, if you're willing to learn new technologies and
improve yourself constantly, there are limitless opportunities to do amazing
things on the Web today.
</p><p>
Let's start with languages. It's clear that a huge proportion of Web
development is being done with dynamic languages. Ruby, Python and
PHP continue to dominate (outside of large corporations, at
least). But we also see a large number of open-source
languages based on the JVM, such as Clojure and Scala, each of which
have their own Web development paradigms and frameworks. The rise of
Go, a compiled, open-source language from Google, also is intriguing
(and is something I hope to cover in an upcoming installment of
this column). True, some languages are more popular than others, but
you can find work in just about any language you want today, trying it
out and learning how that language's paradigms fit into the tapestry
of languages and frameworks.
</p><p>
Perhaps the most important language today is JavaScript. JavaScript,
which never has been one of my favorite languages, now is required
knowledge for anyone who works on the Web. It sits inside every
browser and increasingly is used for server-side programs as well.
JavaScript's ubiquity, and the fact that it is necessary for
high-powered Web applications that live inside of the browser, means
that such organizations as Google and Mozilla are spending enormous
amounts of time, money and effort trying to get JavaScript to execute
as efficiently as possible. The sophistication of browser-based
programs never ceases to amaze me, and that's all due to JavaScript.
</p><p>
There's also a growing trend of languages that compile into
JavaScript, such as CoffeeScript and ClojureScript, allowing us to
write in one language but execute something else (that is, JavaScript) in
the browser. And then there are the JavaScript frameworks, including
Backbone.js and Angular.js, which are making it possible to create
browser-based applications that not only do amazing things, but which
also are structured like the serious applications that they are. I've
often said that today, developing software isn't that difficult, but
maintaining software is, and thus, server-side Web
developers eventually realized they needed to rely on libraries
and frameworks in order not to lose their minds.
</p><p>
As the browser part of applications become more sophisticated, we see
that server-side Web applications increasingly are becoming API
servers, offering outsiders a chance to retrieve and modify data
stored in a database of some sort. True, there always will be a need
for server-side Web development, but it seems to me that as people
learn to create better and better experiences within the browser,
we're going to see the server as a remote storage mechanism, offering
one of the many APIs that our browser contacts in order to bring up a
fancy-looking application for our users.
</p><p>
Indeed, we see a trend of breaking Web applications into many little
parts, each of which specializes in a different thing. You want to
have real-time updates? Use Pusher or PubNub. You want to have
nice-looking fonts? Use Google. You need more servers? Fire up some
additional machines from Amazon or Rackspace. Or, if you want to
think about your servers from an even higher level of abstraction,
use Heroku, which costs more but reduces your IT staff to nearly
zero. The same is true for login systems, e-commerce transactions
and even commenting systems, each of which now can be outsourced, via
an API and a few minutes of work, and then plugged in to your Web
application. The use of APIs is particularly relevant today, when we
have so many people accessing the Web not via traditional browsers,
but rather via mobile devices and platform-specific apps. That app
you installed might not look like it's contacting a Web site, but
it's undoubtedly making a JSON API call over HTTP in the background.
</p><p>
In other words, we're finally seeing the start of Tim Berners-Lee's
original vision, in which people all over the world are both
retrieving and contributing information, no matter where they happen
to be. I'm writing this from Chicago, where I'm spending the summer,
but thanks to modern Web technologies, I'm able to see my family in
Israel (including play Chess with my aforementioned son), order books
and other merchandise to my apartment, read the news, check the
weather, pay for airline and movie tickets and listen to music. And
no, none of this should come as a surprise to anyone reading this
magazine, or even anyone who has been using the Web at any time in the
last decade. But that's just the point. If we can step back a bit
from the technologies we're using, we can see how much easier our
lives have been as a result of the Web.
</p><p>
Web development was exciting when I started to do it 20 years ago, and
the amazing thing is that it remains just as exciting today. If
you've always wanted to be a Web developer, choose a language,
learn how to use it to write Web applications and then see what you
can do. I never cease to be amazed by the magic of programming, and
the Web makes it possible to spread that magic to the entire world.
Here's to the next 20 years of advances in Web technologies&mdash;and to
the next 200 columns I'll write for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>!
