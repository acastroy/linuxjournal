Dual-booting and change-rooting&mdash;lots of fun on the Acer C7!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c6a580.0x1d621f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The Acer C7 caught my attention when my wife and I determined we could
no longer share our single Linux Mint laptop. My wife was frequently
squinting at her cell phone's Internet browser, fighting my four-year-old
daughter to use our Nexus 10 tablet, or struggling to remove my eight-year-old son from his Ubuntu laptop when I needed to use our shared laptop
for school or work. I initially was drawn to the Acer because of its low
$199 price. However, the C7's upgrade-ability really impressed me. So,
I bought one, model C710-2847, in January 2013 at a local Best Buy
along with a $25 4GB DDR 1300 memory module just in case the laptop's
out-of-the-box performance was not adequate.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11503f1.large.jpg"><img src="11503f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c6a580.0x1d62568"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
The first prototype Chromebook was the Cr-48 released in 2010, and several
Chromebooks have been produced since then. Google released the latest Chromebook
this year and called it the Pixel for good reason. The laptop shines with a
beautiful 239 pixels per inch screen and other high quality features, but it
comes
at a steep $1,299 price. Most other Chromebooks contain average specifications
with a 1.x GHz Intel Atom or Celeron processor, 2GB of RAM, 16GB solid-state
drive and ~12" 1366 x 768 screen. Two notable exceptions to these
specifications, besides the Pixel, are the Samsung ARM Series 3 and Acer C7. The
Samsung is razor-thin with an Exynos 5250 reduced-instruction-set-computer
(RISC) processor, matte screen and $249 price. The Acer's standout feature is a
320GB hard drive at a bottom-priced $199.
</p><p>
Bill Childers reviewed the Samsung ARM Chromebook in the July 2013
issue, and
this month, Peter Cook reviews its closest competitor, the Acer C7 Chromebook. 
The two laptops differ significantly in hardware and upgrade-ability.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c6a580.0x1d627d0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Cost:</b></p><p>
I was further drawn to the Acer when I found out that Google offers two years of free
100GB Google Drive storage with the purchase of a C7. I could use the storage
to back up my photos and documents. The 100GB plan costs $4.99 per month, making
the offer's value just shy of $120. I didn't need a calculator to realize this
brought the C7's cost down to $79!
</p><p>
The free plan will be applied to your Google account soon (that is, not
immediately) after registering the Chromebook. Don't expect Google to figure out
how to apply the free 100GB if you have an existing Google storage plan. The
free storage will be added to your existing plan. For example, someone with an
existing 25GB plan will see 125GB at $2.49 per month, which is the cost of 25GB.
Simply cancel the existing storage plan, and the 100GB will remain at no
cost. Data stored under the existing paid plan will be available
automatically on the free plan.
</p></div><p>
The 1.4kg Acer C7 laptop has a dual-core 1.1GHz Intel Celeron 847, 2GB
DDR3 SDRAM, 5400 RPM 320GB hard drive and 4-cell battery. The screen,
keyboard and touchpad are definitely sufficient for my wife to browse the
Internet and read e-mail. The 11.6" glossy screen is nicely bright at
200 nit and easily viewed indoors. Rounding out the periphery hardware,
the C7 has an SD/MMC media card reader, 1.3-megapixel Webcam, microphone,
three USB 2.0 ports, VGA output and HDMI port.
</p><p>
The C7 uses the Chrome operating system, which is a lightweight operating
system optimized for Web browsing. Do not confuse ChromeOS with the open-source Chromium operating system. ChromeOS began from Ubuntu Linux in
2009 with a contracted engineering service from Canonical. A year later,
Google switched to Gentoo Linux. Today, ChromeOS is not based on any Linux
distribution and is released by Google only for official devices. However,
the source code is available through the Chromium OS project and can be
installed on potentially any device.
</p><p>
ChromeOS provides a specialized debug terminal via the Chrome
browser. Press Ctl-Alt-T, and a terminal will open with &ldquo;Welcome to
crosh, type 'help' for a list of commands.&rdquo; Type
<tt  >help</tt> to list seven
commands including the always useful <tt  >top</tt> and
<tt  >ssh</tt> commands. Enter
<tt  >help_advanced</tt> to produce a longer list of mostly network-related
commands, such as <tt  >network_diag</tt>, which performs a suite of
network diagnostics.

Upgrades</h2></div></div><p>
Acer released the original C7 in November 2012 and then updated it
in March 2013. The updated C7 has only two changes from the previous
version. RAM has been doubled to 4GB, and the battery is upgraded to
6 cells. The RAM is perhaps a worthy change, but the larger battery
noticeably protrudes from the laptop's bottom. The price also increased
to $279. The increased price is questionable, since the original C7 can
be upgraded easily. Common upgrades are memory, hard drive, battery
and operating system.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Memory</b></span>
</p><p>
The C7 comes with one 2GB memory module installed in one slot
and another empty slot. Maximum memory size available for the C7 is 8GB,
allowing a total of 16GB. Memory may seem like a necessary upgrade,
as the C7 does not use swap space. However, you can enable swap by
opening the crosh terminal, typing <tt  >swap enable</tt> and
rebooting. A warning will appear in crosh stating that swap is an experimental
feature and system instability may occur. Once rebooted, type <tt  >swap
status</tt> to verify the change. You should see /dev/zram0 listed under
Filename with a size of 2932924 megabytes. Typing <tt  >swap
disable</tt> and
rebooting will turn swap off. 
</p><p>
However, based on my trials, the installed 2GB is sufficient, and swap does not
need to be enabled. I opened ten tabs,
some with a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> video running, a Netflix movie
showing and a YouTube
video playing, among several other static pages, and I still was able to
play <span   class="emphasis"><em>Angry Birds</em></span> without issue. Moving between tabs also
was seamless,
and content was uninterrupted. I soon realized the extra 4GB memory I
purchased was not needed. Unfortunately, Best Buy's return policy was
15 days, which surprised me because I expected 30 days. So, I installed
the additional memory. I took off the C7's bottom plate and inserted
the memory module. I verified the install by typing
<tt  >chrome://system</tt>
in the Chrome address bar and then clicking Expand next to meminfo.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11503f3.large.jpg"><img src="11503f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Hard Drive</b></span>
</p><p>
The existing hard drive can be updated with a solid-state
drive (SSD), but there are trade-offs. You will give up a lot of storage
space unless you purchase a large SSD, which can be expensive. Even
the smaller SSDs are not cheap. The extra storage space may be handy if
dual-booting the laptop with a Linux distribution. On the other hand,
SSDs are lighter and probably more reliable than a traditional drive in
a laptop. Don't expect all SSDs to perform spectacularly, because the C7
motherboard supports only SATA II 3GB/sec. An SSD probably would improve
boot speed, but boot time is already a quick 17 seconds. Also, an SSD
probably wouldn't produce much performance improvement, because the C7 does
not use swap space, and the upgrade to 6GB of RAM negated the need for
swap space. Thus, I did not pursue the SSD upgrade. 
</p><p>
Two items to keep in
mind if you decide to upgrade: pick an SSD that is 7mm tall because that
is the height of available space for the hard drive, and pick one that
supports LBA-48. According to some Web posts, the C7 requires a 48-bit
Logical Block Addressing (LBA) scheme. The LBA specifies the location
of data blocks on storage devices. However, upgrading the hard drive
may be a moot point if you haven't already purchased an Acer C7. Best
Buy now offers the Acer C7 at the same $199 price with a 16GB SSD.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Battery</b></span>
</p><p>
I decided to skip the battery upgrade. The original 4-cell
battery (2500mAh 37Wh) provides about three and a half hours of juice,
which is plenty of time for intermittent use around the house, browsing the Internet
and checking e-mail. People more disconnected from a power source
may want to purchase a 6-cell battery. However, more powerful batteries
can have form factors that counter the C7's slim dimensions.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Operating System</b></span>
</p><p>
Before upgrading the operating system, it is important
to create a recovery image. Acer C7 recovery images are available from
Google for download via Windows, Mac and Linux. A recovery image 
also can be created on the C7. Type &ldquo;chrome://imageburner&rdquo; in the C7 Chrome
browser address bar to access the Image Burner tool. The tool requests
1) a 4GB or larger USB Flash drive or SD card be inserted and 2)
acknowledgment that data on the C7 will be erased. These are the only
two steps before the image is burned, which takes about eight minutes. Hold
down Esc-F3, and tap the Power button to enter Recovery Mode.

</p></div></div><p>
Recovery Mode also provides entry to Developer Mode, which can be used to
access system files and create a custom ChromeOS via a Bourne shell. Enter
Recovery Mode first, and then press Ctl-D to enable Developer Mode. After
the ChromeOS comes up, press Ctl-Alt-F2 to access the shell and Ctl-Alt-F1 to switch to the ChromeOS graphical user interface. Note, the
C7 will not detect keystrokes while using the shell, so power management
will dim and, eventually, turn off the screen. There are methods to
disable/tweak power management, but my preference for turning the screen back
on has been to switch to the GUI, press a key, and then switch back to the
shell. 
</p><p>
While in Developer Mode, an &ldquo;OS verification is OFF&rdquo; warning screen
appears each time the laptop is restarted. Press the spacebar when the
warning screen appears to exit Developer Mode and return to Normal Mode.

My time in the shell has been spent installing different Linux
distributions, such as Ubuntu. The first approach I tried was dual-booting
Ubuntu from a USB Flash drive using ChrUbuntu 12.04. Jay Lee created
ChrUbuntu for the first Cr-48 Chromebook in 2010, and since then he has expanded
this special build of Ubuntu 12.04 to other Chromebooks. Unfortunately,
it has not been optimized for the Acer C7 yet. I still decided to
give it a try. I entered Developer Mode and after about 45 minutes
had ChrUbuntu installed on an 8GB USB drive. Ubuntu worked very well,
but failed to resume correctly after going to sleep. In many cases, the
user interface would come back up and screen pointer would move, but
the icons would not work. I jumped to a terminal and also found, using
<tt  >top</tt>, that polkitd and dbus-daemon were continually consuming &gt;50%
of the CPU, and console-kit-daemon and NetworkManager were consuming
around 10&ndash;15% each. Further, I noticed the C7 ran very hot, and the fan
was quite audible.
</p><p>
Next, I tried to install ChrUbuntu 12.04 on the C7's 320GB hard drive
alongside ChromeOS. The install went well, but it still had the same
CPU issues and ran hot. Jay Lee released a new ChrUbuntu script on May
31, 2013, that installs any flavor and version of Ubuntu, such as Xubuntu
12.04. I chose the standard install, which is Ubuntu 13.04. Unfortunately,
I encountered the same CPU and heat issues as before. I provided this
feedback to Jay Lee as requested on his blog.
</p><p>
I entered Recovery Mode and inserted the recovery media to restore the
C7's original condition. Note that all data on the C7 will be erased, and
there is no warning. However, Google-synced data, such as Bookmarks, will
not be affected.

</p></div></div><p>
Then I tried to install ubermix. The ubermix distribution is built by
educators for students and teachers. It has received a lot of positive
press and recognition from the education community. The current version
uses Ubuntu 12.04, Linux kernel 3.4.0 and GNOME 3.4.2 with a streamlined
user interface that is probably too simple for Linux power users. I
downloaded the ubermix install key image to my Linux Mint laptop, placed
it on a USB thumbdrive and copied it to the Acer C7 via Developer
Mode. Install was very similar to ChrUbuntu, because you run the same
install script twice, once to repartition the hard drive and second to
install the new operating system. The two-step process took about 20
minutes. Happily, everything worked well except some special keys, such
as brightness and sound. I followed the simple instructions on the Ubermix
on Chromebooks wiki to resolve those issues. Although the ubermix user
interface is fairly basic, it does have easy access to more advanced
features like system settings, terminal window and so on. The single issue I
found with ubermix was that only 2GB of the installed 6GB memory was
recognized, but system performance was still very good.

I reloaded the factory ChromeOS via Recovery Mode and tried to install
ChRomium Os UbunTu chrOot enviroNment also known as Crouton. It was
created by David Schneider and uses a chroot operation to run Ubuntu on
ChromeOS devices. In theory, the chroot approach should work for any
Linux distribution because they will all run by using ChromeOS&mdash;that
is, the distribution is not booted by itself, but rather runs within
ChromeOS. Thereby, reboot is not needed to switch between Ubuntu and
ChromeOS. I downloaded Crouton, opened a crosh terminal via Ctrl-Alt-T, typed
<tt  >shell</tt>, and ran this command to install Xubuntu: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton - xfce
</pre>
</p><p>
The install completed in about 45
minutes. Entering <tt  >sudo startxfce4</tt> in the crosh shell
started Xubuntu,
and everything worked well. I pressed Ctrl-Alt-F1 to get back to
ChromeOS. Interestingly, I could not press Ctrl-Alt-F2 to get back to
Xubuntu. I had to press Ctrl-Alt-F2, which brought up Developer Mode,
and then press Ctrl-Alt-F3 to get back to Xubuntu. Other distributions
are available with Crouton, such as Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Xubuntu and the
standard Ubuntu. Type <tt  >sudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -t
help</tt> to see
available target distributions and correct nomenclature for downloading.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This journey to the Acer C7 Chromebook began when my wife and I
determined we could no longer share our single Linux Mint laptop. Now
we have determined we can no longer share our single Chromebook! It is a
fantastic laptop that performs great for basic tasks. You can upgrade the
C7's hardware, but it's not really necessary. You also can play around
with the operating system, which is a lot of fun. There are some real
opportunities to learn and grow Linux on the C7 with a custom ChromeOS,
ChrUbuntu, ubermix and Crouton. Best of all, after playing around,
the C7 can be restored to factory condition in about ten minutes, and
everything will be synced back to your configuration automatically.
