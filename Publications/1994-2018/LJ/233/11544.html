<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #233, September 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> doesn't just make whatever changes he wants to the kernel.
Sometimes he goes through the normal procedure of sending code to the relevant
maintainers. Recently he sent a patch to <span   class="bold"><b>Al
Viro</b></span>, trying to speed up the <span   class="bold"><b>VFS</b></span> by
migrating some data out of <span   class="bold"><b>SELinux</b></span> and into the
<span   class="bold"><b>inode data structure</b></span>.
</p><p>
Linus also went on a brief tirade about security features, and how some of them
ended up slowing down performance by 50%, before he and Al fixed it. He and
<span   class="bold"><b>Casey Schaufler</b></span> (the <span   class="bold"><b>Smack</b></span> maintainer) had a bit of a dispute over that. Casey
said security folks cared a lot about performance and had to deal with
hostile tirades like Linus' all the time, and so were motivated to do better.
</p><p>
Once upon a time, <span   class="bold"><b>32-bit kernels</b></span> were so cool. Nowadays, they are scorned with
derisive sneers. Linus Torvalds recently remarked, &ldquo;anybody who runs a 32-bit
kernel with 16GB of RAM doesn't even understand <span   class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> flawed and stupid that
is.&rdquo; 
</p><p>
However, some popular distributions still ship with 32-bit kernels by default,
and <span   class="bold"><b>Pierre-Loup A. Griffais</b></span> recently pointed out that this was causing huge
slowdowns for unsuspecting users.
</p><p>
The problem is bad enough that <span   class="bold"><b>Rik van Riel</b></span> suggested giving 32-bit kernels a
hard limit of 8 or 12GB of RAM, regardless of how much physical RAM was
present on a given system. He added that the kernel also should print a friendly
warning &ldquo;to inform users they should upgrade to a 64-bit kernel to enjoy the
use of all of their memory.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Regardless of this patch, the problem with distributions may persist. As
<span   class="bold"><b>H.
Peter Anvin</b></span> put it, &ldquo;We kernel guys have been asking the distros to ship 64-bit
kernels even in their 32-bit distros for many years.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Linus Torvalds went on vacation and temporarily lost the ability to make
<span   class="bold"><b>tarball</b></span>
releases of new kernel versions. He updated his git tree, but he apologized for
the lack of tarballs. He also speculated that maybe nobody even used the
tarballs anymore, now that git existed.
</p><p>
However, <span   class="bold"><b>Randy Dunlap</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Mikael Pettersson</b></span> immediately replied that they did
indeed rely on the tarball method. And, Linus reassured them that he'd keep
putting out tarballs for the moment.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Nathan Zimmer</b></span> posted a patch to parallelize
<span   class="bold"><b>RAM initialization</b></span>. Typically during
bootup, RAM is initialized by a single CPU, before any other CPUs are started
up. On Nathan's system, this caused boot times of more than an hour. With his patch,
the CPUs would all be brought up first, and then RAM could be initialized by all
of them together, over much less time.
</p><p>
Originally, he made it a configuration option, but <span   class="bold"><b>Greg
Kroah-Hartman</b></span> said there was no
reason for that&mdash;just make it an intrinsic feature. Clearly no one would choose
to configure a slower boot time.

<h2 class="title">Beyond Google Reader: CommaFeed</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #233, September 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Now that Google Reader is officially gone, most folks have settled
on a replacement of some sort. In fact, a few months ago I even went
through the process of installing Tiny Tiny RSS as a viable and powerful
replacement. At the time, there was only one feature I sorely missed,
the &ldquo;next unread blog&rdquo; link. Approximately three days before Google Reader
shut down for good, I found the holy grail of RSS readers: CommaFeed.
</p><p>
CommaFeed is an open-source project written in Java. It's offered as
a free Web-based solution at <a href="https://www.commafeed.com" target="_self">https://www.commafeed.com</a>.
Although the interface is
similar to Google Reader, it feels slightly stripped down. Thankfully,
it provides a bookmarkable link that will take you to your next unread
RSS entry. That feature is the single most important, and difficult to
find, RSS reader feature I need.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11544commaf1.large.jpg"><img src="11544commaf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
CommaFeed unfortunately doesn't have a really good mobile interface, and
it's lacking features in its Android app, but improvements are being
made on both fronts. I must admit, however, that even more important
than the &ldquo;next unread blog&rdquo; link feature, is the ability to download the
source code from GitHub and compile CommaFeed for self-hosting (<a href="https://github.com/Athou/commafeed" target="_self">https://github.com/Athou/commafeed</a>). I don't
ever want to get &ldquo;Google Reader'ed&rdquo; again. Hosting is
complicated, because
it's a Java application, but the instructions on the GitHub site make it
fairly painless. I recommend trying out <a href="https://www.commafeed.com" target="_self">https://www.commafeed.com</a> before compiling
and self-hosting, because CommaFeed's interface might not be for everyone.

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Notepad++ Is Better Better</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #233, September 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
If anyone understands the importance of a good text editor, it's a Linux
user stuck on Windows. Sure, Microsoft supplies Notepad and Wordpad,
but neither really feels like the powerful sort of text editor a Linux
user expects. Enter Notepad++.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11544fossf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Notepad++ provides features like line numbering, syntax
highlighting and tabbed file editing. If those seem like ordinary
features that should be included in any text editor worth its salt,
well, you're right. Notepad++ is fully open source, and it is the preferred
simple text editor on Windows. It's certainly not a full IDE, but all the
developers I know have it installed if they use Windows. Give it a try
at <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org" target="_self">notepad-plus-plus.org</a>.

<h2 class="title">Google Drive for Linux?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #233, September 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
For some reason, Google seems to dislike Google Drive users who prefer
Linux. I find this particularly strange, since Google's Chrome OS is based
on Linux. Thankfully, the folks over at Insync not only provide Linux
support for Google Drive syncing, they do it with style.

</p><p>
Insync is a commercial, proprietary application that installs natively in
Linux (<a href="https://www.insynchq.com" target="_self">https://www.insynchq.com</a>). It offers selective sync, integration with several file managers
and a nice tray icon showing sync activity. The coolest feature, however,
is the seamless conversion from Google Docs format to LibreOffice
format. You can edit your Google Drive documents with the native
LibreOffice application, and then it automatically will sync to the cloud
in the Web-based Google Docs format! I've tried only a few documents,
but in my limited testing, the conversion and sync have been perfect.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11544insyncf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Insync has a 15-day free trial and a one-time cost of $9.99. Packages
are available for Ubuntu, Fedora, MEPIS and even an unofficial build for
Arch Linux. Now that version 1.0 has been released, Insync is available
for anyone to download. Due to its native Linux support and super-cool
conversion/sync ability, Insync earns this month's Editors' Choice award.

<h2 class="title">Pitch Perfect Penguins</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #233, September 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
My daughters love the movie <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pitch Perfect</em></span>. I suspect our XBMC has
played it more than 100 times, and I'm not exaggerating. Whether or not you enjoy
young-adult movies about singing competitions and cartoon-like projectile
vomiting, I'll admit it's a pretty fun movie. The question my
girls ask me most often is about the audio-mixing software the
protagonist uses to make her &ldquo;sick beats&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Although Anna Kendrick uses a Macintosh in the movie, and the software's
name is obscured or changed in close-ups, it's easy to tell the software
she uses is Mixxx. The cool part for me is that while indeed Mixxx works
on OS X, it's an open-source application that works natively in Linux as
well. That means, in the eyes of my daughters, Linux is now super-cool.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11544mixf1.large.jpg"><img src="11544mixf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Mixxx is an editing package with incredible visual tools (<a href="http://www.mixxx.org" target="_self">www.mixxx.org</a>). It's
designed to &ldquo;mix&rdquo; several songs or rhythm tracks and export a completed
song. The very nice GUI makes mixing audio easy to understand, and the
interface itself is apparently cool enough for Hollywood. So whether you
want to make your own &ldquo;wicked tracks&rdquo; or join an 
a cappella group, Mixxx is just the tool for you. Also, I recommend watching
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Pitch Perfect</em></span>, one or two of those XBMC viewings might have been my own!

<h2 class="title">Graphics and Stats in One Easy Package</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #233, September 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
As always in experimental science, you need to analyze the data you
collect to see what it's telling you about the world. In the beginning
stages, you usually need to be able to do some graphical analysis to get an
overall view of any trends being revealed by your experiment. Once you
get to the point of having a model you want to test, you then
need to run some statistical tests to see how well your model fits the
data. It always is more convenient to learn one tool rather than two. To
this end, there is the package called SciDAVis (Scientific Data Analysis and
Visualization, <a href="http://scidavis.sourceforge.net" target="_self">scidavis.sourceforge.net</a>). 
</p><p>
SciDAVis started life as a fork of QtiPlot. It has
moved quite a bit from the original codebase with the addition of
several new features and changes to the underlying data structures. The
functionality it provides is similar to commercial programs like Origin
and SigmaPlot. It also is similar to another open-source program called
LabPlot. In fact, beginning in 2008, these two projects started working
together on a common back end while continuing with their own front ends
and their own feature sets. In this article, I take a quick look
at some of the things you can do with SciDAVis for your own data
analysis tasks.
</p><p>
First, you need to install SciDAVis.
Most distributions should have a
package available. In Debian-based distributions, you can
install it with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install scidavis
</pre>
</p><p>
Binaries also are available for Mac OS X.
If binaries
aren't available, you can download the source tarball and build it specifically
for your system. You need to have the Qt libraries installed, because
the interface is built using them. 
</p><p>
When you first start SciDAVis, you
get an empty project and an empty data table with two columns of numeric
values (Figure 1). Selecting a column displays the details of that
column in a window on the right-hand side. Selecting the description
tab lets you change the name of the column, as well as add a comment
describing what the column represents. The type tab lets you change what
kind of data you can enter for this column from numeric to text, month
names, day names or full dates. You also can set the format of the data
type for each column. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11544scif1.large.jpg"><img src="11544scif1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Opening SciDAVis gives you an empty two-column data table.
</p></div></div><p>
When you are first learning to use SciDAVis, you probably will just want
some junk data to play with. You can do this easily by right-clicking
the columns and selecting &ldquo;Fill Selection with&rdquo;. Then, you can fill the
column with either row numbers or random numbers. Once you have some data
available, you can create new columns that are functions of the values
stored in the other columns. To access this functionality, you need
to select the formula tab in the right-hand side pane. In order to explore
some of the other features, let's set the first column to be the row
numbers and the second column to be a set of random numbers (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11544scif2.large.jpg"><img src="11544scif2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. You can use fill functions to create data in order to try things out.
</p></div></div><p>
One of the first things you will want to do is plot the data to
see what it looks like. To do a basic plot, you simply can right-click
on a column and select Plot. If you are just doing an initial look
at the shape of the data, select Plot&rarr;Line or Plot&rarr;Scatter (Figure 3).
The x axis is simply the index values, and the y
values are the data elements from the column. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11544scif3.large.jpg"><img src="11544scif3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Scatter plots are only a couple mouse clicks away.
</p></div></div><p>
If you want to do more
complicated plots, SciDAVis provides a full plotting wizard. To access
the wizard, either press Ctrl-Alt-W or click View&rarr;Plot Wizard. This will pop up a new window where you can select which
columns will be used for the x, y and z axes. You also have the option of
selecting columns to represent the errors for the x and y axes. You need
to create a new curve where you can set the relevant columns. You can
create multiple curves that will all be plotted on the same graph. You
then get a new window with the plots generated. 
</p><p>
The point of SciDAVis is
to make this type of work easy, so you can double-click on the various
elements to edit the details of your graphs. Double-clicking on the
title, or the axis labels, will pop up a window where you can change the
content and the display. You also can change the details of the axes
themselves. Double-clicking on an axis will pop up a new window where
you can set the scale, the type of grid, the axis displays and a set of
general options (Figure 4). Each of these sets of options is available
under its own tab in the option window. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11544scif4.large.jpg"><img src="11544scif4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. You can change all of the elements of your graphs.
</p></div></div><p>
Once the graph looks
the way you want it, you will want a copy for your publications. To
do this, you either can right-click on the graph and select Export
or click on the menu item File&rarr;Export Graph. Then you can
select your preferred file format for saving the image.
</p><p>
Although graphs can be very useful when trying to get an intuitive grasp
of the shape of your data, you do need to back up this intuition with
hard numbers. The first thing to do, usually, is simply look at
the column statistics. Right-clicking on the column, you would select
Column Statistics. This creates a new table where you will get
the number of rows in the column, along with other statistics like the
standard deviation, variance, sum, minimum and maximum. You can see
if there is any correlation between two columns. You need to select
two columns from your table, and then click on the menu item Analysis&rarr;Correlate. This will pop up a new graph window showing a picture
of the correlation. 
Two new columns will be added to your data table
where you can find the lag and correlation values of this particular
analysis. 
</p><p>
If the data you are looking at has some type of periodicity,
you can calculate an FFT of it to see the spread of frequencies within
your data. By selecting a column and clicking on the menu item Analysis&rarr;FFT, you
will get a pop-up window where you can select the details of
the FFT you want to calculate. Once these are set, click OK,
and a new graph window will be displayed with the FFT plotted (Figure 5).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11544scif5.large.jpg"><img src="11544scif5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. FFT analysis is useful in signal processing.
</p></div></div><p>
Once you have had a chance to look at your data, you may have started
to form an idea of a model that represents the system you were
measuring. An idea is not enough, however. You actually need to do some
calculations and see whether your model fits the data you collected. Two
options are available. The first is to use the Fit Wizard. You
can access it by clicking on the menu item Analysis&rarr;Fit Wizard. This
pops up a window where you can build a function describing your
model. Once you have built up your model, click the button
called Fit. This pops up a new window where you can select the details
of doing the actual fitting of the generic function to your data. Here
you can set the initial guesses and select the algorithm used to do
the actual fitting (Figure 6). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11544scif6.large.jpg"><img src="11544scif6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. The Fit Wizard lets you define your model and see how well it fits your data.
</p></div></div><p>
You also can set how many iterations to
try and the tolerance of when you can stop. When everything is set to
your satisfaction, click the Fit button. This pops up a
new graph window, plus an output window detailing the results of trying
to do the fit. The other option of trying to fit your model is to start
with your initial graph. In this case, you start by right-clicking the
main graph window and selecting the Analyze option. This opens
a submenu where you can select one of a number of common defaults,
such as linear, polynomial, exponential growth or decay, among several
others. You also can open the Fit Wizard from this submenu.
</p><p>
This article has been only a very short introduction. Lots
of other functions are available if you are willing to go through the
manual. Also, you have the option of using Python as a scripting language
within SciDAVis in order to do even more complicated data analysis. You
might need to compile from source, however, if the binaries available
to you don't include this functionality. Hopefully, you will take the
time to learn what may be a very useful tool for analyzing your
experimental data.
