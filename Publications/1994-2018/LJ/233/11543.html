Dave explains how to add contextual memory to a script so it can keep track

It's been months, and I'm still dealing with a DDOS (distributed
denial of service) attack on my server&mdash;an attack that I can see is coming
from China, but there's not really much I can do about it other
than try to tweak firewall settings and so on.
</p><p>
In my last article, I started describing analyzing Apache log files and system
settings to try to create some scripts that can watch for DDOS 
attacks and flag them before that inevitable e-mail from a customer about
the site being down or incredibly slow.
</p><p>
Honestly, it's pretty disheartening dealing with these anonymous
attacks, but that's another column. If you've had experience with
this sort of long-term problem, I'd be interested in hearing about how
you finally resolved it.
</p><p>
The first script I worked on simply tracks how many processes are running
on the server. It's just a small step from monitoring the output of the
<tt  >uptime</tt> program, which, of course, could be done as easily as:


<pre     class="programlisting">
load="$(uptime | cut -d\  -f14 | cut -d. -f1)"
if [ $load -gt 4 ] ; then
  echo "Uptime greater than threshold. What's going on?"
  uptime
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
That's marginally interesting, but let's go back to analyzing the
number of processes running, as that's a better indication that there
might be a DDOS happening. Last time, I used a loop of <tt  >ps ;
sleep</tt> and kept
track of the min/max values. After running for a while, the script's
output was something like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Current ps count=90: min=76, max=150, tally=70 and average=107
</pre>
</p><p>
Interpret this as after running for 90 cycles, the minimum number of Apache
(httpd) processes running at any given time was 76, max was 150 and average
was 107.
</p><p>
Once you've run this script for a few hours, you'll have a pretty
good idea of typical traffic load on your server, which is critical for you
to be able to detect out-of-pattern variations. If my average Apache
process count is 107 and the server has 917 processes, there's a
problem. On the other hand, if the average load is 325 processes, 600 isn't
too far out of band and could be representative of a spike in traffic
rather than the beginnings of an actual attack.
</p><p>
I wrapped up last month's article by showing a script suitable for
running from <tt  >cron</tt> that would look for abnormal traffic spikes.
But it had some problems, as I highlighted at the end of the column, my
nerd version of a cliffhanger&mdash;no murder unsolved, no car in the driveway,
no police sirens, just some code that needs improvement. Hey, work with me
here!
</p><p>
The core problem with the script was really a lack of context. That is,
it's not the very first time that it sees abnormally high process counts
that I want to be notified, but the third or fourth time in a row. And then
once it has notified me, I want the script to be smart enough not
to notify me again unless things settle down and then jump up again.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Context.</em></span>
</p><p>
With some scripts, this sort of thing can be quite tricky, requiring
temporary files and semaphores to ensure that the script doesn't step
on another version of itself reading/writing the file simultaneously.
It's doable, but you really have to think about worst-case situations,
temporarily blocked I/O channels and so on.
</p><p>
Fortunately, that's not the situation here. In fact, you can accomplish
the addition of context by adding a couple state variables. Let's
start by pulling the monitoring script back in:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
# DDOS - keep an eye on process count to 
# detect a blossoming DDOS attack
pattern="httpd"
max=200   # avoid false positives
admin="d1taylor@gmail.com"
count="$(ps -C $pattern | wc -l)"
if [ $count -gt $max ] ; then
  echo "Warning: DDOS in process? Current httpd 
  &#8618;count = $count" | sendmail
$admin
fi
exit 0
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's use a &ldquo;repeated&rdquo; variable and set it to send a
notification after
the fourth occurrence of too many processes. That's just a matter of
changing the conditional statement:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $count -gt $max ] ; then
  repeated=$(( $repeated + 1 ))
  if [ $repeated -eq 4 ] ; then
    echo "Warning: DDOS in process? Current httpd count
    = $count" | sendmail $admin
  fi
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
Not too difficult. But, what happens when there's then an iteration
where the count isn't greater than the max threshold? That's also
easily handled if you're willing to keep redundantly setting
<tt  >repeated</tt> to
zero. The outer &ldquo;fi&rdquo; simply changes to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
else
  repeated=0
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
These additions produce both of the desired updates actually, because
<tt  >repeated</tt> ensures that it won't notify of a problem until
it's happened a few times, and the conditional <tt  >$repeated -eq
4</tt>
rather than, say, <tt  >$repeated -gt 4</tt>, also means that
if it's
slammed for 15 iterations, you'll still see only one e-mail message.
</p><p>
Finally, visualize a sequence where you get a spike for a while, then it
quiets down. Then another spike hits for a few seconds, then it quiets down for an
hour or two, and then it spikes again. That scenario will work as desired too,
sending e-mail twice, once for each sustained spike, but not for the
one-iteration spike in the middle (because in that instance,
<tt  >repeated</tt> never gets beyond 1).
</p><p>
If you've been looking closely at the script, you'll have noticed
that what appears at first glance to be an innocuous &ldquo;echo&rdquo;
statement is in fact producing an e-mail message to the administrator.
It's the second half of the statement that's doing the heavy
lifting:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "Warning: DDOS in process? Current httpd count
    = $count" | sendmail $admin
</pre>
</p><p>
I'm old-school, so I go straight to the MTA (mail transport agent), but
in reality, a better way to do this, an approach that would have the e-mail
include a subject line, is to do something more like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo | mail -s "DDOS Warning" $admin
</pre>
</p><p>
Because sendmail is designed to be used behind the scenes, it lacks the
refinement of things like a <tt  >-s</tt> flag to specify the subject of the
message.
</p><p>
In fact, you can make this even a bit more elegant by turning the entire
command into a variable:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sendmsg="mail -s 'DDOS Warning' $admin"
</pre>
</p><p>
Then you easily can tack it onto the end of the echo statement:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo | $sendmsg
</pre>
</p><p>
What's the biggest problem with this approach? That if there are any errors, the
pipe is only for stdout, not stderr, and those errors will be lost.
</p><p>
If you were going to run the script every few minutes from
<tt  >cron</tt>, you
could use its capability of e-mailing stdout + stderr, but that would
involve a more complex contextual tracking solution (as discussed earlier).
</p><p>
Well, I'm off to install this script on my server and see how it does
for a while. And you? Your assignment, dear reader, is to shoot in some
proposed topics for me to explore in my column. What scripts would you like
to see created, doing what?
