Love Python, but don't want the overhead of a large Web framework? Try
Flask, a lean, powerful microframework.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2630580.0x2728358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Let's face it, the Web has gotten big and complicated. No longer is
it really possible for someone to be the &ldquo;Webmaster&rdquo;, as we used to
say back in the olden days of Web development. Today, we have
front-end developers, back-end developers, system administrators,
graphic designers, writers and any number of other jobs associated
with the Web. Those of us fortunate enough to know a few of these
things call ourselves &ldquo;full-stack Web developers&rdquo;, but even full-stack
developers need other people, with other talents, in order to get a
Web application up and running.
</p><p>
As the Web has become more complex, so have the frameworks we use to
develop applications. Once, we could put up a simple application in a
matter of minutes by writing a CGI program. Later, it was enough to
slap together a few pages of PHP or perhaps even a template that
mixed HTML with a higher-level language. But then came the
frameworks&mdash;first the big ones, from the Java and .NET worlds, and then the
open-source ones, particularly Rails (for Ruby) and Django (for
Python).
</p><p>
These frameworks are totally amazing, and they do just about everything
you ever would want from a Web-development framework. But over
time, these frameworks&mdash;developed in order to get away from large,
do-everything frameworks from the world of enterprise software&mdash;have
become big. I won't use the term &ldquo;bloated&rdquo;, because the fact is that
I believe most framework maintainers are doing a good job of
balancing the core needs and functionality with optional extras.
</p><p>
However, there are times when you want the best of all worlds&mdash;the
ease and speed of creating something without a big framework, while
still enjoying the benefits that a framework can provide. This is
where &ldquo;micro-frameworks&rdquo; can suit your needs perfectly. For example,
when creating the site that powers my consulting Web site
(<a href="http://lerner.co.il" target="_self">lerner.co.il</a>), I wanted there to be some dynamic
content and also to be
able to program things. But, I wasn't about to fire up a full instance
of Rails or Django just for that.
</p><p>
One of the first, and best-known, microframeworks is Sinatra, which I
covered in this column several years ago. Sinatra is written in Ruby,
which makes it a great alternative to Rails for smaller projects. But
if you're a Python developer, and particularly if you want to make use
of the terrific Python infrastructure and community, you actually
have several options from which to choose.
</p><p>
Perhaps the best known and most fully featured microframework for
Python is Flask, written by Armin Ronacher and other members of the
international &ldquo;Pocoo&rdquo; team of Python developers. There are other
microframeworks for Python, such as Bottle, but Flask seems to do a
good job of balancing ease of use, a small core, oodles of features, a
distinctly Python-like feeling when developing sites in it and a
large array of extensions that make it easy to add all sorts of
functionality without writing it yourself.
</p><p>
So in this article, I take a brief tour of Flask and show how it can make
life quite easy for Web developers. I've already incorporated Flask
into the curriculum of some of my Python courses, not only because it
allows us to get up and running quickly, but also because I find that the design
reinforces the coding style Python developers should aim to
attain.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2630580.0x2728988"></a>
Starting with Flask</h2></div></div><p>
Assuming that you have pip (the modern Python installation program)
on your computer, you can install Flask with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pip install flask
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2630580.0x2728ae8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
(Depending on the permissions of your computer, you might need to
install the above as root.) 
</p><p>
With that package (and its
dependencies) in place, you're ready to start developing. Create a
new Python program that contains the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/env python

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def foo():
    return "Hello, world...!"

app.run(debug=True)
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's go through this program (which I have called simple.py), line
by line, to see what it does before you run it. The first line is
actually not surprising to anyone with Python experience; it simply
means that you want to open the &ldquo;flask&rdquo; module or package and put
the &ldquo;Flask&rdquo; class defined there in the current namespace. With that
done, you now can create an instance of Flask, which you do using the
built-in <tt  >__name__</tt>, which, of course, will be the
string <tt  >__main__</tt> on
all programs run directly from the command line.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2630580.0x2728f08"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. simple.py</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/env python

from flask import Flask, render_template, request
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/blah")
@app.route("/")
def foo():
    return render_template('foo.html')

@app.route("/submit", methods=["POST"])
def submit():
    username = request.form['name']
    return "Thank you for submitting a form, %s." % username

app.run(debug=True)
</pre></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2630580.0x2729118"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. foo.html</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Hello!&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Test paragraph&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;form method="POST" action="/submit"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Name: &lt;input type="text" name="name" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="Send your name" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;

  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre></div><p>
Now the real magic begins, with the line starting with
<tt  >@app.route</tt>.
The @ at the start of the lines indicates that this is a decorator.
This isn't the appropriate place to go into detail on what decorators
do, but suffice it to say that this allows <tt  >app.route</tt> to execute both
before the <tt  >foo()</tt> function is defined, and also each time it is
executed. Routes are just one place in Flask that use decorators in
this way; you also can use them to ensure that certain actions happen
before or after others.
</p><p>
You also can use multiple decorators on a single function definition.
Thus, if you (for whatever reason) want two different URLs to invoke
the same function, just stack the decorators:

<pre     class="programlisting">
@app.route("/foo")
@app.route("/")
def foo():
    return "Hello, world!"
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, you can see that the function &ldquo;foo&rdquo; takes no parameters and is
a normal Python function. The only unusual thing about this function
is that you don't invoke it directly. Rather, the Flask framework
invokes your function for you, based on the URL to which the user has
navigated. So when the user goes to &ldquo;/&rdquo;, which has been registered
with <tt  >app.route</tt>, Flask knows to invoke this function, and it does so.
The string that is returned by the function is then returned to the
user's browser.
</p><p>
Finally, you tell your application, which you created with the call to
<tt  >Flask(__name__)</tt> at the top of the file, that it
should run. You could
do that just by invoking <tt  >app.run()</tt>, but by passing
<tt  >debug=True</tt> as a
keyword parameter, you gain a number of things, including automatic
reloading of files without restarting the server, and a browser-based
debugger and console if and when things go wrong.
</p><p>
If you now invoke simple.py:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./simple.py
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
 * Restarting with reloader
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2630580.0x27298a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
the server is waiting on port 5000. You can point your browser to
http://localhost:5000 and immediately see &ldquo;Hello, world!&rdquo; It's
not the
fanciest of responses, but not a bad one.
</p><p>
I'm probably jumping the gun a bit, but the Web-based console is
pretty snazzy, and I think it really can help in debugging.
Instead of the &ldquo;return&rdquo; line shown above, in which you return a string,
replace it with the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
return "a" + 5
</pre>
</p><p>
No, this line isn't valid Python, but that's just the point. You're
deliberately forcing an error. Now, go back to the &ldquo;/&rdquo; URL in your
browser, and you should see a long stack trace with error messages.
So far, that's not too exciting. But if you move your mouse cursor to the
right side of the darker lines (that is, those containing source code),
you'll see two icons appear. The rightmost icon (of a text file) will
display the Python source code that was executing when the error
occurred.
</p><p>
Far more powerful is what happens if you click on the darker
(terminal-like) icon. A full-fledged Python interpreter and console
opens up, containing the variables and functions that were defined at
that point in the stack. You can open a console for any point in the
stack trace, explore the stack frame and its variables, and figure out
what went wrong in your program.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2630580.0x2729cc8"></a>
Simple Templates</h2></div></div><p>
Returning strings of text, or even HTML, from within a function is
good for a simple demo, but quickly becomes tedious. Flask's JinJa2
templates support not only HTML, but also a Python-like syntax that you
can embed inside the templates. For now though, let's ignore JinJa2's
capabilities and create a simple form you can submit.
</p><p>
First and foremost, if you are going to use JinJa2 templates, you need
to create a subdirectory called &ldquo;templates&rdquo;. This subdirectory should
exist in the same directory as simple.py. Inside this templates
directory, let's create a very simple HTML file:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Hello!&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Test paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, this template won't do much. But the fact that it's a
full-fledged HTML file means you suddenly can have all of the
text, CSS, links and JavaScript that you want, without having to stuff
it inside a triple-quoted string in your function.
</p><p>
As things currently stand, the template (in templates/foo.html) isn't
going to be called by your &ldquo;foo&rdquo; function. You need to change the
function such that it invokes the template. You do this with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
@app.route("/foo")
@app.route("/")
def foo():
    return render_template('index.html')
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >render_template</tt> function is defined in the
<tt  >flask</tt> module, which
means you'll need to change your <tt  >import</tt> statement at the top of
the program too:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from flask import Flask, render_template
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you've done that, you can reload the page,
and&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>voil&agrave;!</em></span>&mdash;the
template is rendered, as you hoped.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2630580.0x2b224f0"></a>
Handling Forms</h2></div></div><p>
It's pretty typical for sites to have one or more HTML forms. You've
already seen just about everything you need in order for Flask to
process forms, believe it or not. All you need to do now is modify your
template so that it contains an HTML form, write a function that is
invoked with POST, and then grab the submitted form element and do
something with it. Each of these three steps is fairly easy with
Flask.
</p><p>
First, add an HTML form to your template:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Hello!&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Test paragraph&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;form method="POST" action="/submit"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Name: &lt;input type="text" name="name" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="Send your name" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;

  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
This indicates that the form will be submitted using the POST
method to the &ldquo;/submit&rdquo; URL. In addition to a
&ldquo;submit&rdquo; button, the
form consists of a single text field, called &ldquo;name&rdquo;. If you click on
the &ldquo;submit&rdquo; button, you get an error message:

<pre     class="programlisting">
The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the
URL manually please check your spelling and try again.
</pre>
</p><p>
That's not a surprise, given that you haven't defined a route for it,
let alone a function. Let's add that to simple.py:

<pre     class="programlisting">
@app.route("/submit")
def submit():
    return "Thank you for submitting a form."
</pre>
</p><p>
If you go back to &ldquo;/&rdquo; and enter your name, then click on
&ldquo;submit&rdquo;, you get the
following error:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Method Not Allowed

The method is not allowed for the requested URL.
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that the problem here isn't that Flask doesn't recognize the
route. Rather, the route doesn't know how to handle a POST request.
That's because routes in Flask are assumed to handle GET, unless you
specify otherwise. You can do that by passing the &ldquo;methods&rdquo; parameter
to your route, specifying a list of methods (as strings) that are
acceptable:

<pre     class="programlisting">
@app.route("/submit", methods=["POST"])
def submit():
    return "Thank you for submitting a form."
</pre>
</p><p>
Sure enough, if you submit the form, you get the text back. But this
text is rather generic. It would be nice to acknowledge the user's
name, given that he or she went through the trouble of providing it. You
can grab the user's name, as well as any other form parameters, via
the &ldquo;request&rdquo; object that Flask makes available to you.
<tt  >request.form</tt>
is a dictionary-like object that lets you query the form via key names
(as strings). You need to import &ldquo;request&rdquo; from the
&ldquo;flask&rdquo;
package:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
</pre>
</p><p>
And, then you can do this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
@app.route("/submit", methods=["POST"])
def submit():
    username = request.form['name']
    return "Thank you for submitting a form, %s." % username
</pre>
</p><p>
If you're thinking this all seems very simple&mdash;well, that's
precisely the point. Flask is there to let you run ahead quickly
using the Python you already know to create simple but
interesting Web applications.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
If you are familiar with Python, want to create Web applications and
don't want the overhead of a large framework like Django, you
might well want to consider Flask. The core framework is (as you saw
here) easy to get up and running, and the extensions make it extremely
flexible and powerful.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2630580.0x2b230a0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

The Flask home page is at <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org" target="_self">flask.pocoo.org</a>. This includes
links to the code, documentation, tutorials, examples and an official
list of Flask extensions. The documentation is excellent, and it should
provide anyone with even a bit of Python knowledge with good
understanding of Flask.
</p><p>
Miguel Grinberg, who recently authored a book about Flask for O'Reilly
(which I haven't yet had a chance to read or review), has written an
