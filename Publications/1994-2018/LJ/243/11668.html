The private cloud is a term used for a flexible proprietary
computing architecture that provides compute, storage and network
resources to various business units of an organization behind a firewall.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e57580.0x1f4f2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Consider this traditional scenario: in today's competitive world, dynamic business
requirements need flexible and rapid provisioning of IT resources. Along
with flexibility, traditional IT environments need new resources to
support the dynamic workloads of applications. It is a very likely scenario
where separate business units within the same organization manage their own
computing resources, such as hardware, software, storage, networking and
applications, creating silos of computing infrastructure. Power,
space and cooling of corporate data centers are some of the major
challenges faced by organizations today. Applications running on increased-capacity hardware are not able to utilize available resources in
an efficient manner in traditional data centers. In addition to this, expert
human resources are needed to maintain and manage the whole environment.
</p><p>
Fortunately, developments in computing have opened many possibilities
for all types organizations, including education and
government. Until recently, a main concern was deployment and
hosting of applications considering cost or inadequate acquisition of
compute, storage and network resources with a fixed capacity for managing
unexpected application traffic demands. Other challenging tasks were
to manage the installation, maintenance and configuration of the whole
stack that supported the respective application. In the past few years, cloud
computing has been considered as a boon for organizations that 
were facing these issues in traditional computing environments. Application
design, deployment, maintenance and hosting have become easier, agile
and less costly with the use of the pay-per-use charge-back model provided
by cloud providers. IT executives are considering transitions from
traditional data centers to cloud infrastructures for cost reductions
and more agile IT environments.

What Is Cloud Computing?</h2></div></div><p>
According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, ubiquitous and
on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing
resources,
such as servers, networks, storage, applications and services, that can be
provisioned and de-provisioned rapidly with minimal management effort or
service-provider interaction. These cloud models support availability and
are composed of five essential characteristics, three service models
and four deployment models. The four deployment models are the public cloud,
private cloud, community cloud and hybrid cloud.
</p><p>
Cloud computing provides an agile environment, faster time to market,
infinite scalability and services. Different applications,
depending on their type, have different scaling and performance
requirements. The cloud
environment is perfectly suitable for applications where users have
dynamic and competing traffic requirements. However, the five characteristics,
three service models and four deployment models create a hazy situation
when you want to use the cloud to deploy various kinds of applications. Public
cloud services from third-party service providers are considered to be
a windfall for SMBs, but for large enterprises, application security,
compliance adherence and CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity and
Availability of data) are fundamental, so it is difficult to convince
them to adopt the public cloud.
</p><p>
Primarily, business data is the heart of any organization. All compliance
requirements based on regulatory constraints and risks revolve around
that critical and sensitive data. Security, compliance, vendor lock-in
and interoperability are on the rise and are obstructing public cloud
adoption.
</p><p>
The question one should ask is, &ldquo;If public cloud service providers
can deliver services efficiently and realize all benefits, including
cost benefits and efficient resource utilization, then why
can't organizations do this with existing expertise, an investment in
resources and the availability of private cloud products that help
organizations build cloud environments under their own control?&rdquo;
</p><p>
It seems obvious that the journey to the cloud will take place
in environments where organizations have more trust and
control. Essentially, by building a private cloud and then integrating it
on-site, with private cloud data or applications in the public cloud, in
the process, they can build a hybrid cloud by utilizing existing resources.
</p><p>
The private cloud refers to
a flexible proprietary computing architecture that provides compute,
storage and network resources to various business units of an
organization behind a firewall.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e57580.0x1f4f828"></a>
The Private Cloud&mdash;Is It Really a Cloud?</h2></div></div><p>
The private cloud provides an in-house cloud infrastructure, absolute control
over resources, more security and privacy, and manageable compliance
to regulatory requirements. It also requires a huge capital investment
and the expertise for building a private cloud environment and maintaining that
infrastructure. In the IT industry, thought leaders and other experts
have different points of view on private clouds. Initially, the experts
made 
their points of view public about
the private cloud, saying the idea that organizations can run an internal
cloud as efficiently as public cloud service providers does not mean it
is a real cloud. Let's consider the various arguments based
on economy of scale, cost sharing and multi-tenancy.
</p><p>
Organizations may not realize one of the primary
benefits of cloud computing: economies of scale. Public cloud environments
provide agility and scalability that organizations require to survive
in this modern era of wider customer bases. However, organizations that
choose to adopt private rather than public clouds may miss out on the same
benefits. Hence, it often becomes a major point of discussion that the private
cloud does not carry the similar value propositions as the public cloud.
</p><p>
One significant question raised by many public cloud supporters was
regarding cost sharing. Who is sharing costs with the private cloud
owner? According to them, if all the costs are managed by a single
organization, it is not a cloud. If a single organization owns the computing
resources, it is not a cloud.
</p><p>
Multi-tenancy is fundamental to the cloud's proposition. Multi-tenancy
and shared resources are two of the defining characteristics of cloud
computing environments in which compute, storage and network resources
are shared between multiple users. Organizations deploy the application
and store data in the cloud, driving down the cost for all.
Organizations shift the resource management burden and risks to the
service provider. This is why the cloud is so exciting. One perspective is,
if it is not multi-tenant, it fails the test, and it is not a cloud. It
is just an environment that delivers remote resources, and that has been
around for years in organizations.
</p><p>
In a nutshell, an organization that builds a private cloud will spend
more money and achieve less benefits compared to
the public cloud, which needs expertise to build it, but it provides greater
control and better perceived security.
</p><p>
The private cloud has come a long way to gain momentous footing in
the market. Public cloud vendors who once criticized private clouds
are now providing features for interoperability with private cloud
platforms. So, it's a reasonable assumption that the private cloud is a
real cloud. Still, it's better to muse over general features and aspects
than to draw a firm conclusion. The public cloud has changed performance
expectations for IT dramatically, but there are industries where the latency effect of
any public cloud transaction will lead to intolerable service levels,
loss of revenue and so on. These concerns have captured the attention of IT
leadership. It is a strategic decision to build your own cloud that
requires stakeholders to think meticulously and exclusively. It is the
need of the hour that organizations must enable self-service and become
on-demand providers of infrastructure, platforms and applications for
their internal business units. Speed and agility, not cost reduction,
drive private cloud implementations.
</p><p>
Now, let's take a step forward in the discussion by revisiting the history
of Amazon's Public Cloud. How did Amazon start its operations and offerings
of the public cloud? It all started with the intent to gain flexibility
and agility in the traditional environment. For those same reasons, IT
organizations are building private clouds today.
</p><p>
Many public cloud providers have announced their connection with various
private cloud vendors. Now the question is why has everyone accepted the
existence of &ldquo;private clouds&rdquo;? Many organizations still have concerns
regarding putting their intellectual property or critical applications in
the public cloud or off-site or beyond the organization's firewall. They
aptly assessed the market situation and realized that they stand to gain
by partnering in the private cloud arena.
</p><p>
It is a simple case of the first step in the direction of
acceptance of the existence of private clouds and
the foresight of hybrid cloud implementations.
</p><p>
According to a poll at a recent Gartner data-center conference, 47%
of respondents want the ability to manage clouds on-premises and off-premises centrally by 2015. There will be more private cloud deployments
in coming years, because OpenStack, CloudStack, Eucalyptus, VMware, BMC
and HP are maturing and emerging. However, the technology is not without
its challenges. It requires an up-front investment in hardware, software,
training on implementation and managing the cloud.
</p><p>
Let's take a close look at private cloud benefits, building blocks
and open-source private cloud vendors to get more information.

Benefits of Using Private Clouds</h2></div></div><p>
Private cloud computing introduces a new way to use IT resources
and brings automation, process changes, management changes, service
standardization, culture and policies that consistently come up in polls
as more difficult challenges than the technology itself. Private cloud
architectures should be designed with the future use of hybrid cloud
implementations in mind, providing more choices and a potential migration
path to public cloud services as they mature. In the case of private clouds,
private cloud resources will be used in place of dedicated servers, and
thus, organizations will realize the following benefits:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Security&mdash;security and governance capabilities specifically designed
for an organization's requirements.
</p></li><li><p>
Regulatory and compliance&mdash;controls the service level of the platform,
based on the organization's needs and compliance requirements.
</p></li><li><p>
Control&mdash;the organization owns, operates and controls the way services
will be delivered to various departments and partners.
</p></li><li><p>
Efficient utilization of resources and better resource provisioning
systems&mdash;highly automated in terms of how it manages pools of
resources,
including everything from compute capability to storage, analytics,
process management and middleware.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Given these benefits, why wouldn't everyone choose a private cloud? 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e57580.0x1f50170"></a>
Building Blocks of Private Clouds</h2></div></div><p>
Various cloud service providers offer the building blocks for a
private cloud infrastructure virtualization (hypervisors, such as ESXi,
Xen and so on), self-service, metering or chargeback, and automated workflow
management. Most private cloud providers also provide a management platform
as well as security products and best practices to make the private
cloud infrastructure robust and secure.

Real-World Application of a Private Cloud</h2></div></div><p>
Commonly, lab automation, dev-test, performance testing, sales
demonstrations and so on are use cases that are best fits for a private cloud.
Consistent and reproducible environments
improve uniformity between development, test and production
environments. A self-service option not only helps in productivity, but it
also avoids many issues, such as variable workload demands. Scalability
is more complicated to manage manually.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e57580.0x1f50538"></a>
Open-Source Private Cloud Product Vendors</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
OpenStack:</b></span>
</p><p>
OpenStack offers an open-source cloud computing platform to build different
kind of clouds, such as public, private and hybrid clouds. Rackspace
(the &ldquo;Cloud Files&rdquo; platform) and NASA (Nebula) started it in 2010.
At present,
HP, SUSE Linux, Red Hat, Cisco, Dell, IBM and others have joined the OpenStack
project. It now is released under Apache license. OpenStack provides an
Infrastructure-as-a-Service solution through a set of unified services,
and each service offers an API that facilitates this integration.
</p><p>
OpenStack components: 
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Compute provisioning and managing large networks of
virtual machines.
</p></li><li><p>
Block storage provides persistent block storage to guest
virtual machines.
</p></li><li><p>
Object storage stores and retrieves files. 
</p></li><li><p>
Networking
enables network connectivity as a service and enables users to create
and attach interfaces to networks.
</p></li><li><p>
The dashboard enables users to interact
with OpenStack services to launch an instance and to set access control.
</p></li><li><p>
The identity service provides authentication and authorization for
OpenStack services.
</p></li><li><p>
The image service provides a registry of virtual machine
images.
</p></li><li><p>
The metering/monitoring service is used for billing, benchmarking
and statistics purposes.
</p></li><li><p>
The orchestration service orchestrates multiple
composite cloud applications.
</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
CloudStack:</b></span>
</p><p>
CloudStack is an open-source cloud computing platform to create, manage or
deploy an Infrastructure-as-a-Service model in a service-provider environment
or in an organizational environment. Cloud.com originally developed it in an
initial phase. Cloud.com initially released most of CloudStack under
the GNU General Public License, version 3. Citrix later released
the remaining code under GPLv3. Citrix donated CloudStack to the Apache
Software Foundation. CloudStack 4.2.0 was released on October 1,
2013, and it is the latest stable version available at the time of this
writing. It supports the end-to-end functionality that is required for IaaS, which includes compute,
storage, network, user management, user interface, RESTful API
and command-line tools. It supports hypervisors, such as KVM, VMware
vSphere, XenServer and more for virtualization. CloudStack implements
the Amazon EC2 APIs, Amazon S3 APIs and vCloud API in addition to its
own API. CloudStack installation includes two parts: 1) the management server
manages the cloud infrastructure and 2) the cloud infrastructure itself.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11668f2.large.jpg"><img src="11668f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. CloudStack
</p></div></div><p>
With CloudStack, a zone normally corresponds to a data center. There
can be multiple zones in a data center. Pods are enclosed within
zones. Each zone can control one or more pods. Zones can be private
or public.
</p><p>
A CloudStack pod represents a single rack that consists of one or more
clusters of hosts and one or more primary storage servers. Hosts in the
same pod are available in the same subnet. A host is a computer that
provides the computing resources, such as CPU, storage, memory, networking and
so on
to run the virtual machines. CloudStack is hypervisor-agnostic.
Multiple hypervisor-enabled servers, such as a Linux KVM-enabled server,
a Citrix XenServer server or an ESXi server can be used.
</p><p>
Each host has a hypervisor to manage the VMs. A cluster is a collection
of one or more hosts and one or more primary storage servers. It can be
considered as a set of XenServer servers or a set of KVM servers.
Primary storage is coupled with a cluster that stores the disk volumes
for all the VMs running on hosts in that specific cluster. Secondary
storage is shared by all the pods in the zone that stores ISO images,
templates and disk volume snapshots.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Eucalyptus:</b></span>
</p><p>
Eucalyptus is available in two different flavors: 1) open source and 2)
a commercial private IaaS service provider. Eucalyptus is short for
&ldquo;Elastic Computing Architecture for Linking Your Programs to Useful
Systems&rdquo;. The cluster controller manages a collection of node controllers. It
has access to public and private networks. It controls execution of
VMs and manages virtual networking too. Each Eucalyptus cloud will have
multiple cluster controllers, and each Eucalyptus cloud will have one or
more node controllers per cluster controller. It controls VM activities,
such as launch instances, inspection, termination of instances and
cleanup of instances. The cloud controller manages virtualized resources
of the Eucalyptus-based private cloud environment. Each Eucalyptus cloud
will have a single CLC.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11668f3.large.jpg"><img src="11668f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Eucalyptus features:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Linux and Windows virtual machines (VMs) are supported.
</p></li><li><p>
Security groups and elastic IPs are supported.
</p></li><li><p>

One of the leading sportswear companies is using Eucalyptus as the
foundation for its cloud computing initiative to support its elastic and
dynamic requirements related to marketing campaigns. The Eucalyptus-based
private cloud environment has helped the company deliver faster time to
market, agility, highly available, scalable and elastic Web applications
using a secure on-premises IT environment. With the Eucalyptus cloud, it is
able to provide a fast, highly available e-commerce experience for its
customers worldwide. It uses scaling up and down to manage
variable demand effectively. One-click deployment of applications, quick provisioning
and de-provisioning of compute and storage resources on secure, reliable
and highly available on-premises infrastructure is extremely useful for
the on-line campaign management.

Public Clouds vs. Private Clouds</h2></div></div><p>
The private cloud is recommended over the public cloud in the following scenarios:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Stringent security management and regulatory compliance requirements
demand tight security controls and full visibility into how the IT
infrastructure is managed. It prevents moving the applications and data
to an external cloud.
</p></li><li><p>
High-performance requirements need the cloud to be set up and accessed
over a private high-speed network.
</p></li><li><p>
Need for full flexibility and control over how to operate the cloud to
enable business innovation and future growth based on the cloud.
</p></li><li><p>
Consolidate and standardize hardware and software resources of an
organization; create a shared, automated service platform for business
users, and account them for usage.

dynamically (partly on a self-service basis) over the Internet from an
off-site third-party provider who shares resources and bills on usage or
subscription basis.</td><td>An IT infrastructure that is under control of an organization's

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The private cloud contrasts with the public cloud computing environment,
where access to the resources is open to any customer who is willing
to pay. There are number of variations that fit somewhere between those
two, such as community cloud computing, virtual private cloud computing
and hybrid cloud computing. The private cloud offers organizations a way to
take the benefits of increasing simplicity of resource management with
automation, flexibility and cost benefits,
and provides an environment to be more competitive in the marketplace
through greater control, choice, efficiency, quality of service
and, most important, business agility. It is particularly well
suited for organizations that are in greatly regulated sectors, such as
health care, finance or banking or those that have made huge capital investments
in existing data-center infrastructure, including virtualization and
server consolidation.
</p><p>
Enterprise interest is already high, with roughly 75% of respondents
in Gartner surveys saying that they plan to follow a private cloud
computing strategy by 2014. This trend will move quickly on the
Hype Cycle in the next couple years, as the private cloud moves from
a strategy to pilot and production deployments. According to Gartner
research, by 2015, the majority of private cloud computing services will
evolve to leverage public cloud services in a hybrid model.
