<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #243, July 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Once in a while someone points out a <span   class="bold"><b>POSIX
violation</b></span> in Linux. Often the
answer is to fix the violation, but sometimes <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> decides that
the POSIX behavior is broken, in which case they keep the Linux behavior,
but they might build an additional POSIX compatibility layer, even if that
layer is slower and less efficient.
</p><p>
This time, <span   class="bold"><b>Michael Kerrisk</b></span> reported a POSIX violation that affected file
operations. Apparently, reading and writing to files during multithreaded
operations could hit race conditions and overwrite each other's changes.
</p><p>
There was some discussion over whether this was really a violation of POSIX,
but ultimately, who cares? Data clobbering is bad. After Michael posted some
code to reproduce the problem, the conversation focused on what to do to fix
it. But Michael did make an argument that &ldquo;Linux isn't consistent with UNIX
since early times. (E.g., page 191 of the 1992 edition of Stevens APUE
discusses the sharing of the file offset between the parent and child after
fork(). Although Stevens didn't explicitly spell out the atomicity
guarantee, the discussion there would be a bit nonsensical without the
presumption of that guarantee.)&rdquo;
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Al Viro</b></span> joined Linus in trying to come up with a fix. Linus tried
introducing a simple mutex to lock files so that write operations couldn't
clobber each other, and Al offered his own refinements that improved on
Linus' patch.
</p><p>
At one point, Linus explained the history of the bug itself. Apparently, once
upon a time the file pointer, which told the system where to write into the
file, had been locked in a semaphore so only one process could do anything
to it at a time. But, they took it out of the semaphore in order to
accommodate device files and other non-regular files that ran into race
conditions when users were barred from writing to them whenever they
pleased.
</p><p>
That was what introduced the bug. At the time, it slipped through
undetected, because that actual reading and writing to regular files was
still handled atomically by the kernel. It was only the file pointer itself
that could get out of sync. And, because high-speed threaded file operations
are a pretty rare need, it took a long time for anyone to run into the
problem and report it.
</p><p>
An interesting little detail is that, while Linus and Al were hunting for a
fix, Al at one point complained that the approach Linus was taking wouldn't
support certain architectures, including <span   class="bold"><b>ARM</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>PowerPC</b></span>. Linus' response
was, &ldquo;I doubt it's worth caring about. [...] If the ARM/PPC people end up
caring, they could add the struct-return support to gcc.&rdquo;
</p><p>
It's always interesting to see how corner cases crop up and get dealt with.
In some cases, part of the fix has to happen in the kernel, part in GCC and
part elsewhere. In this particular instance, Al felt the whole thing could
be done in the kernel, and he was inspired to write his own version of the
patch, which Linus accepted.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Andi Kleen</b></span> wanted to add low-level CPU
event support to <span   class="bold"><b>perf</b></span>. The problem
was that there could be tons of low-level events, and it varied widely from
CPU to CPU. Even storing the possible events in memory for all CPUs would
significantly increase the kernel's running size. So, hard-coding this
information into the kernel would be problematic.
</p><p>
He pointed out that the <span   class="bold"><b>OProfile</b></span> tool relied on publicly available lists of
these events, though he said the OProfile developers didn't always keep
their lists up to date with the latest available versions.
</p><p>
To solve these issues, Andi submitted a patch that allowed perf to identify
which event-list was needed for the particular CPU on the given system, and
automatically download the latest version of that list from its home
location. Then perf could interpret the list and analyze the events, without
overburdening the kernel.
</p><p>
There was various feedback to Andi's code, mostly to do with which directory
should house the event-lists, and what the filenames should be called. The
behavior of the code itself seemed to get a good reception. One detail that
may turn out to be more controversial than the others was Andi's decision to
download the lists to a subdirectory of the user's own home directory. Andi
said that otherwise users might be encouraged to download the event-lists
as the root user, which would be bad security practice.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Sasha Levin</b></span> recently posted a script to
translate the <span   class="bold"><b>hexadecimal offsets</b></span>
from stack dumps into meaningful line numbers that pointed into the kernel's
source files. So something like &ldquo;ffffffff811f0ec8&rdquo; might be translated into
&ldquo;fs/proc/generic.c:445&rdquo;.
</p><p>
However, it turned out that Linus Torvalds was planning to remove the hex
offsets from the stack dumps for exactly the reason that they were
unreadable. So Sasha's code was about to go out of date.
</p><p>
They went back and forth a bit on it. At first Sasha decided to rely on data
stored in the <span   class="bold"><b>System.map</b></span> file to compensate, but Linus pointed out that some
people, including him, didn't keep their System.map file around. Linus
recommended using /usr/bin/nm to extract the symbols from the compiled
kernel files.
</p><p>
So, it seems as though Sasha's script may actually provide meaningful file
and line numbers for debugging stack dumps, assuming the stack dumps provide
enough information to do the calculations.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Repix, Not Just Another Photo App</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #243, July 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Apps like Instagram have made photo filters commonplace. I actually
don't mind the vintage look for quick cell-phone snapshots, but a filter
can do only so much. At first glance, Repix is another one of those
&ldquo;make your photo cool&rdquo; apps that does little more than add a border and
change saturation levels. It is more than that, however, taking photo
modification to the next level and making it art.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11694androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="11694androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
The photo here, for instance, is from the Repix Flickr stream. It's
obviously been filtered, but you're sure to notice there's a lot more
going on. I'm not a terribly visually artistic person, but Repix allows a
few simple touches to make a beautiful difference. If you're looking for
a simple way to make your cat photos a little more exciting, but don't
want to have to transfer photos to a desktop application, check out
Repix. The standard features are free, but with an in-app purchase, you
can get more packages to play with. 
</p><p>
Due to its ability to help a luddite
like myself create artsy photographs, Repix gets this month's Editors'
Choice award. If you like to take photos, but don't have an artistic
bone in your body, I urge you to check it out. It's in the Play Store,
but the Web site is <a href="http://www.repix.it" target="_self">www.repix.it</a>.

I've always loved PHPMyAdmin for managing MySQL databases. It's Web-based,
fairly robust and as powerful as I've ever needed. Basically, it's
awesome. Today, however, I discovered something better than awesome:
Adminer. Although it is conceptually identical to PHPMyAdmin, it is far
simpler and far more powerful. How can it be both? The Adminer Web site
has a great feature comparison: <a href="http://www.adminer.org/en/phpmyadmin" target="_self">www.adminer.org/en/phpmyadmin</a>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11694fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="11694fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
For me, the interface is basic, no-nonsense and intuitive. I like that
installation is a single PHP file, and I also like that it supports
alternate database systems like Postgres. If you are someone who prefers
to use a Web interface over the command line, don't be ashamed. Heck,
I recently managed an entire database department at a university, and I
still prefer a Web-based interface. Anyway, if you're like me, you'll
love Adminer. Get your copy today at <a href="http://www.adminer.org" target="_self">www.adminer.org</a>.

<h2 class="title">Open-Source Space</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #243, July 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
As I write this, NASA has just passed another milestone in releasing its
work to the Open Source community. A press release came out announcing
the release on April 10, 2014, of a new catalog of NASA software that
is available as open source. This new catalog includes both older software
that was previously available, along with new software being released for
the first time. The kinds of items available include project management
systems, design tools, data handling and image processing. In this
article, I take a quick look at some of the cool code available.
</p><p>
The main Web site is at <a href="http://technology.nasa.gov" target="_self">technology.nasa.gov</a>.
This main page is a central portal for accessing all of the
technology available to be transferred to the public. This includes
patents, as well as software. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11694nasaf1.large.jpg"><img src="11694nasaf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The main technology transfer site is a portal to provide access
to everything NASA has to offer.
</p></div></div><p>
As a quick start, there is a subject
cloud in the lower central region of the page that can do a search
on several different keywords for you. Unfortunately, this is only a
catalog of all the offerings, and it's not quite complete yet in terms
of detailed information. So, for example, if you click on Command
Control, you will be taken to a results page that includes items like
Rendezvous and Proximity Operations Program (RPOP). If you
click on that, you will be taken to a details page that is essentially
unpopulated. The assumption is that this will be filled in as time
allows in the future. It does give you a list of what is available
though, which is half the battle. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11694nasaf2.large.jpg"><img src="11694nasaf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The results page on a search will give you a list of software and
patents that are available from NASA.
</p></div></div><p>
Staying on the result list page,
you should notice that there is the name of a NASA center on the right-hand side of each line. This is the actual source for the given patent
or software entry. Once you find something of interest, you can go to
the individual center's Web site to find more details about it. On the
lower-right section of the main page of the NASA technology site, you can
find direct links to the technology sections for each of the individual
centers. The amount of information available at each of these centers
varies, but you should be able to find out more details. Some of the
sites have direct download links, so you can get the software that interests you.
In other cases, sites provide only the contact details for a
person you'll need to talk to in order to get copies of the software in
question. A PDF catalog also is available on the front page of the
main technology site. Here, you can get a 172-page catalog of all of the
available software, broken down into 15 categories, for off-line access.
</p><p>
One issue that will become evident right away is that not everyone can
access all of the available software. Some of the released software is
available only to US residents, and some is even more restricted to
only parts of the US government. So, is there an easier option
for the international community? On the front page, there is a
set of other useful NASA links on the lower-left side. The one labeled
NASA Open Source Software (<a href="http://code.nasa.gov" target="_self">code.nasa.gov</a>) will take you to a
sister site that provides access to a more centralized repository
of software released as open source. It is laid out as
a list of available code within a WordPress blog, and it looks like it's
being updated regularly. So, it's worth keeping an eye on this site for
future releases.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11694nasaf3.large.jpg"><img src="11694nasaf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Software released under open source is available at this blog.
</p></div></div><p>
So far, I haven't yet
looked at what kind of software
is available from the technology exchange at NASA, and there is a rather broad
collection to play with. The first one I look at here is the Mission
Control Technologies (MCT). This package, hosted on GitHub, provides
a real-time monitoring and visualizing platform that was developed at
the Ames Research Center for use in spaceflight mission operations. It is
based on configurable components, so you can use this to build your
own application to monitor pretty much anything. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11694nasaf4.large.jpg"><img src="11694nasaf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. With the MCT, you can build your own application to monitor
almost anything.
</p></div></div><p>
If you
want to build your own spacecraft to monitor, you will need some way of
controlling its flight. Enter the Core Flight Executive (cFE), a portable,
platform-independent embedded system framework developed at the Goddard
Space Flight Center. It is used for flight software for satellite data
systems and instruments, but you can use it for other embedded systems. It
is built from subsystems including executive services, time services,
event services, table services and a software bus. Python programmers
can download SunPy, a library to handle several tasks
you run into when doing solar science. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11694nasaf5.large.jpg"><img src="11694nasaf5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. You can do all kinds of solar science with SunPy.
</p></div></div><p>
For many scientific applications, you need to use clusters of
machines. NASA is no exception to this. To handle the complexities,
several software packages are available. For dealing with files,
there are the Multi-Thread Multi-Node Utilities (Mutil). Mutil provides
mcp and msum, which allow for parallelized access to files for moving
around a cluster. If you have a cluster of machines available over SSH,
you can use them with Mesh (Middleware Using Existing SSH Hosts). Mesh
provides a lightweight grid middleware that can group your cluster
hosts into execution units. You then can issue a command, and Mesh will
handle going to one of the available hosts in your group and running
this command. If you need an interactive session, there is Ballast
(Balancing Load Access Systems). With Ballast, when you try to SSH in to
your cluster, you actually end up being shunted onto an available host
within your cluster automatically.
</p><p>
The last package I want to look at is mission analysis. There is the
General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT), which is designed to help you
plan your next trip to Mars. You can use GMAT to model,
optimize and estimate spacecraft trajectories. You can create physical
resources required for the trip, like the spacecraft, thruster, tank,
ground station and so on, and model how the trip will play itself out. There
also are analysis model resources, including differential correctors,
propagators and optimizers to define the details of the model. The user
guide describes the multitude of available options. There also is a
series of tutorials, including simulating an orbit, doing simple orbit
transfers or even planning an optimal lunar flyby using multiple shooting
that walks you through how to use GMAT in greater detail.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11694nasaf6.large.jpg"><img src="11694nasaf6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. GMAT can help you plan out your next deep space mission from the
comfort of your own living room.
</p></div></div><p>
Now that you've looked at some of the newly released code from NASA,
hopefully your interest is piqued enough to go exploring
through the more than 1,000 other pieces of code available there. You never know
what you may find. If you find something really interesting, please share
it with
the rest of us!

<h2 class="title">It Actually <span class="emphasis"><em>Is</em></span> Rocket Science</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #243, July 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I've never once made a model rocket. I've always wanted to, but apart
from &ldquo;tube with explodey rocket part&rdquo;, I really didn't know where to
start with designing. I recently found an open-source application that
should help me with my lack of rocket science know-how: OpenRocket.
</p><p>
The aspect of actually designing a rocket appeals to me, because not
only will I have a better chance of launching a rocket successfully,
but I'll also be able to compare expected results with actual results. If my
carefully designed rocket veers into the neighbor's yard and blows up
the dog house, I want to be able to figure out why!

Rocket Design Process
</p></div></div><p>
If you've always wanted to launch a model rocket, but never had that
really cool middle-school science teacher that showed everyone how, check
out OpenRocket. Even if you did launch rockets in school, with OpenRocket,
you should be able to design a far more complex (and more awesome!) design
on your computer. If you have any success with your pre-designed rocket,
I'd love to see a video! Send a YouTube link to

No matter how much I love Plex, there's still nothing that comes close
to XBMC for usability when it comes to watching your network media on a
television. I've probably written a dozen articles on Plex during the last
few years, so you know that's tough for me to admit. Still, no matter
how many Plex-enabled devices I might buy (Roku, Amazon Fire TV, phones,
tablets, Web browsers), I run XBMC on all my televisions. The interface,
when coupled with a back-end MySQL database, is just unbeatable.
</p><p>
My ultimate dream is that XBMC and Plex would somehow merge together
into an incredible living room experience that also kicks butt on a
mobile device. Until that day of convergence, I'll keep supporting
two platforms. And, the XBMC platform recently got a significant
upgrade. Version 13, code-named &ldquo;Gotham&rdquo; was released in May
2014. By the time
you read this, 13.1 should be out, which fixes some bugs.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11694xbmcf1.large.jpg"><img src="11694xbmcf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
I'm most happy to see continued improvements with the Live TV and PVR
features. Add to that further optimization for Android and Raspberry
Pi devices, and XBMC is by no means out of the game. I'm excited to see
XBMC continue along at a steady development pace. So, my weekend project
once Saturday rolls around? Upgrading all my televisions to Gotham. Get
