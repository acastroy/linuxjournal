A look at some Android apps to help you get your job done.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x16072a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Being a system administrator isn't simple, and being able
to detect problems and quickly solve them from afar is quite an
advantage. Server problems used to mean receiving an urgent phone
call and then making a trip to a data center to fix whatever
was needed. However, today's Android-powered phones
(&ldquo;phablets&rdquo;) and
tablets provide a vast array of tools to help you do away with most
of the bother. You can monitor things remotely, receive alerts instantly and solve
problems from wherever you are. In fact, given the sizes, CPUs and raw
power of today's devices, it wouldn't be too far wide off the mark to say
you can do anything for which you might otherwise require a desktop or
laptop.
</p><p>
In this article, I first cover some tools for diagnostics and for
server and services monitoring. Then I describe some other tools for
remote access, so you can patch up things without going anywhere. 
I don't include tasks that are performed easily with
common apps (say, Chrome for Webmin or PhpMyAdmin, Gmail for getting
e-mail alerts and so on). Instead, I focus on more-specific, less-known Android apps.
</p><p>
I ran all the examples here on my home network, which includes a server,
a couple Wi-Fi routers, several PCs, laptops and what not. I
even added a virtual server running a couple services, and I set up
Nagios monitoring for the servers. For extra variety, I also decided to
keep an eye on an arbitrary external Web service (Open Weather Map, at
<a href="http://api.openweathermap.org" target="_self">api.openweathermap.org</a>), whose public API I possibly
might want
to use for some application. All the tools I use will work equally well
with public or private networks, so this setup won't affect your tests.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x16075c0"></a>
Are Servers Running?</h2></div></div><p>
For starters, let's consider how to keep an eye on Web pages, services
or servers. For Web pages, consider signing up for an on-line monitoring
service (see Resources for a short list), which you can set up to be
warned about failures and crashes by text message or e-mail. As a bonus,
some of these companies even provide their own Android apps to check logs,
run tests and more from your device. These services are quite simple
to set up, so you can use them in addition to the other tools I 
consider here&mdash;more eyes on your systems can't hurt!
</p><p>
To check servers and services directly, I used to use Decaf Monitor,
but nowadays I prefer Server Monitor, because I find its interface
to be clearer, and it's easier to notice what isn't working right. (Of course,
feel free to test both apps; they are rather similar in concept.) 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11585f1.large.jpg"><img src="11585f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Adding a New Server for Monitoring in Server Monitor
</p></div></div><p>
First, define what servers you want to monitor and give each a descriptive
name, plus a hostname or IP address.
Then, long-tap the server name and select &ldquo;Add Component&rdquo; to specify
a port/service to check. (Tests can be done directly via TCP or
over SSH.) Specify the component name (any description) and the port
number. The main display will show your server, and below it, you'll see
all of its
components in green (&ldquo;on-line&rdquo;) or in red
(&ldquo;off-line&rdquo;).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11585f2.large.jpg"><img src="11585f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. A problem is detected: the SSH service isn't running on a server.
</p></div></div><p>
Finally, go to &ldquo;Settings&rdquo;, and you can define whether Server Monitor will
start at boot, choose the polling frequency and whether it will use sound
and/or vibration to let you know if any monitored component isn't
working. Server Monitor does its job simply and well, and it lets you
keep an eye on servers from afar, so it's a worthy tool for your
Android-monitoring bag of tricks.
</p><p>
For more specific and complex server setups, you probably will use
a monitoring tool, such as Nagios. (There are other options, but
that's what I use.) You can verify the status of all monitored servers
and services over the Web, but aNag goes a bit further and does these
verifications on its own and then presents a summary of results that you
can analyze at a glance.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11585f3.large.jpg"><img src="11585f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. aNag shows that SSH isn't accepting connections on a server.
</p></div></div><p>
You even can opt for a widget, which will sit on your screen, updating
itself periodically and warning you in the event of problems. Tapping on
the widget produces a more detailed explanation. For more clarity,
&ldquo;T&rdquo; means &ldquo;Total&rdquo;, &ldquo;U&rdquo; means
&ldquo;Up&rdquo;, &ldquo;D&rdquo; is &ldquo;down&rdquo;,
&ldquo;O&rdquo; is &ldquo;okay&rdquo;, &ldquo;C&rdquo; is
&ldquo;Critical&rdquo;, &ldquo;W&rdquo; is &ldquo;Warning&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;U&rdquo; is &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo;. For more details on those,
check Nagios' documentation (see Resources).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11585f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The aNag widget shows a critical problem with a service.
</p></div></div><p>
Basically, aNag works by connecting to your Nagios instances, scraping
their Web pages, and summarizing and consolidating the information
within in order to present it more compactly. To configure it,
go to its settings, and define one or more Nagios instances.
You'll need to specify its name, the URL for the CGI Web access
excluding the final &ldquo;status.cgi&rdquo; (this parameter usually looks like
http://your.own.site/nagios/cgi-bin/, but check your installation),
user name and password for Nagios access, or possibly some extra parameters
for custom authentication schemes.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11585f5.large.jpg"><img src="11585f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. To set up aNag, provide the details of all available Nagios instances it
should watch.
</p></div></div><p>
While you are at the settings page, examine the multiple options in the
Notification tab, which include not only several methods (vibration,
sound, LED), but also an &ldquo;Auto Silence&rdquo; configuration (to avoid extra warnings
after the first one) and &ldquo;Quiet Hours&rdquo; (periods of time during which
you want no updates and no notifications). Additionally, you should set the &ldquo;Auto
update&rdquo; delay (how often the test should run), and also take a look
at all
the other available configuration possibilities (there are too many to include here).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x1608a08"></a>
Is the Network Okay?</h2></div></div><p>
Another common problem is diagnosing a possibly faulty network, and for
this kind of job, I use Fing Network Tools. (Its developer, Overlook
Soft, also offers Fingbox for remote monitoring of your network
by means of a locally installed sentinel, which is able not only to warn about
network discoveries and events, but also to do services monitoring, server
rebooting and more.) If you are curious about the name, it's
a combination of two common command names, <tt  >find</tt> and
<tt  >ping</tt>&mdash;just don't look up this word in Hungarian!
</p><p>
Fing's main screen provides a network discovery report, which shows all
equipment (Wi-Fi, Ethernet) in your current network.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11585f6.large.jpg"><img src="11585f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Fing's network discovery function provides a clear view of your
network.
</p></div></div><p>
Tap on any entry to get full details, including IP address, MAC address,
vendor, NetBIOS data (Domain, Name, User and Role) and more. You 
also can choose an appropriate icon, name and description for each piece of
equipment. Plus, you can tap on &ldquo;Scan Services&rdquo; to determine all open
ports, &ldquo;Ping&rdquo; and &ldquo;Trace Route&rdquo; (the equivalents
of the command-line
<tt  >ping</tt> and <tt  >traceroute</tt>
commands), and &ldquo;Wake on LAN&rdquo; to wake up
a computer remotely.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11585f7.large.jpg"><img src="11585f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Tapping on an entry provides more information and access to extra
functions.
</p></div></div><p>
Clicking on the gear in the top-right corner provides access to several
more tools, including Network Discovery, Host Tools (port scanning, ping,
traceroute, DNS lookup, &ldquo;Wake on LAN&rdquo; and TCP connection testing),
as well as several configuration items, backup and restore, and more. For
even more tools, consider the Net Swiss Tool, which adds even more tools
to Fing's, including arp, netstat, route, whois and other functions,
such as DNS testing, port scanning and more. If there was a tool with
the functionality of both these apps together, using it would be a
no-brainer, but for the moment, you'll have to work with
this pair!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x1a014f0"></a>
Is Wi-Fi Working?</h2></div></div><p>
Configuring or debugging Wi-Fi setups is also a typical task, and for
this, I use Wifi Analyzer. This app provides five useful tools: a
channel graph, time graph, channel ratings, access points (AP) lists
and a signal meter. The channel graph view shows all available networks
(either in 2.4GHz or in 5GHz&mdash;touch the icon to the left to select
which) along with their channels and signal strength.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11585f8.large.jpg"><img src="11585f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Tapping on an entry gives more information and provides access to extra
functions.
</p></div></div><p>
Alternatively, you can examine the same information in listing form,
by choosing the &ldquo;AP list&rdquo; view, which shows each available connection
point, along with an icon and a bar showing the connection strength,
the device brand, and the used channel and its frequency. The list can
be sorted alphabetically, by channel, by signal strength, by openness,
by vendor or in &ldquo;natural order&rdquo;, which shows your best options
first in
availability terms. If you want to connect to any of the shown networks,
just tap on it.
</p><p>
The &ldquo;Time Graph&rdquo; view shows the different AP's strengths over
time.
Available AP's are at the top of the screen and are color-coded, and if you tap
on one, its graph will be highlighted. To determine which channel to
assign to an AP, use the &ldquo;Channel Rating&rdquo; view, which shows a horizontal
bar graph, pointing out which would be the best options for the AP,
in terms of interference with other nearby networks, on a scale from
0 to 10. Take care to configure the app and select which channels are
available. In the US, there are channels 1 to 11, but 12, 13 and 14 are available
in other regions. If your AP isn't using the best option, just configure
it and fix the problem.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11585f9.large.jpg"><img src="11585f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. You also can determine the optimum channel to use for a router.
</p></div></div><p>
Finally, the most entertaining function (which will make you feel like
a grizzled old uranium prospector, walking around with a Geiger counter
looking for ore) shows a dial with a &ldquo;needle&rdquo; showing the current signal
strength of the AP to which you are connected, and it even adds the option of beeping
in proportion to the strength. Walk around, closer or farther away from
the AP, and the pinging rate will vary. This will let you determine the
best place for an antenna, router or repeater, and it also lets you know if the signal
strength is what you expected.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11585f10.large.jpg"><img src="11585f10.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. Finding the best place for an access point or router is easy with
Wifi Analyzer.
</p></div></div><p>
Wifi Analyzer can handle a lot of common problems, which is why it's in my
bag of sysadmin tools. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x1a01e38"></a>
Remote Access</h2></div></div><p>
If (when!) something happens, what you need is a remote console session,
so you can work directly on fixing whatever is wrong. For this, over
several terminal emulators, I prefer ConnectBot. Its stable version at
the Google Play store is quite old (October 2010!), but work still goes
on, and development versions, as new as November 2013, are available at
the project site (see Resources).
</p><p>
With ConnectBot, you can use SSH or Telnet to connect to a
remote server (or to your own Android device) for command-line
work. You must specify the host and port to which to connect, and
you need to provide either your user name and password or public key certificates (see
<a href="http://michaelchelen.net/articles/android-connectbot-ssh-key-auth-howto.html" target="_self">michaelchelen.net/articles/android-connectbot-ssh-key-auth-howto.html</a>
for this) to gain access. ConnectBot stores your connection details
to simplify reconnecting to known servers.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11585f11.large.jpg"><img src="11585f11.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 11. Connecting to a remote server is easy with ConnectBot.
</p></div></div><p>
You can be connected to several servers simultaneously and change
from one to another. Select the &ldquo;Disconnect&rdquo; menu option, use the
<tt  >exit</tt> command or the key combination Ctrl-D at a
console to disconnect fully. The back button returns you to the main menu, where opened
connections will show a green icon; disconnected ones show it in red. Tap
on an open connection to go back to that session.
</p><p>
You can use ConnectBot either in portrait or in landscape mode, but
the latter is best, especially for using the &ldquo;Hacker's Keyboard&rdquo;
and getting all
the usual PC keys. The small console text can be hard on your eyes, so you
can
use the volume up and down keys to increase or reduce the font size. For
even more screen space, you can remove the status line in Settings.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11585f12.large.jpg"><img src="11585f12.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 12. Working remotely is best with a landscape tablet and Hacker's
Keyboard.
</p></div></div><p>
For better history, set the scrollback size to 1000 or more lines. So
connections won't be dropped when they are in the background, check the box
&ldquo;Persist Connections&rdquo;. Finally, set &ldquo;Keep Screen
Awake&rdquo;, so your device
won't turn off while working, and set &ldquo;Keep WiFi active&rdquo;, so your connection
won't be dropped.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x1a026d0"></a>
Doing It Graphically</h2></div></div><p>
Working with a remote server over SSH is probably the most common way
of fixing sysadmin problems, but if you want to connect to a machine
running the X Window System (not quite usual on servers, but far more likely on
terminals), there are ways to access that server from your tablet. (Why a
tablet? Scrolling and panning a full-size display on a phone's small
window is just about murder!) There are two options you should consider:
android-vnc-viewer and TeamViewer. The first is totally free, and
the second is free too, but only for non-commercial work (it requires a
license otherwise).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11585f13.large.jpg"><img src="11585f13.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 13. Defining a connection to VNC is simple.
</p></div></div><p>
On opening android-vnc-viewer, you can choose an earlier defined
connection or create a new one. Speed for such connections usually isn't 
great, so you may want to investigate different color formats&mdash;24
bits of color depth look good, but fewer colors mean higher speed. When a
connection is established, you can work remotely as with a browser. Your
finger is the mouse, a single tap is a left-click, and a double tap is a
right-click. (For other needs, try Menu&rarr;Send Keys.) Long-tapping
the screen provides buttons for enlarging or reducing the display, as well
as
a virtual keyboard. This app can be a bit harder to configure, because
you'll probably have to open ports and so on in order to access an internal
machine over the Web. If this is a problem, check out the second option.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11585f14.large.jpg"><img src="11585f14.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 14. Yes, the remote desktop can be tiny! Zooming and panning are
mandatory.
</p></div></div><p>
If you have someone over at the remote machine, and the security rules at
your site allow for it, TeamViewer is easier to use, because it doesn't
require configuring any firewalls or forwarding any ports. If a machine
can connect to the Web, it can connect via TeamViewer to another machine,
since the TeamViewer servers mediate the connection. You'll need a
(human!) helper at the remote machine to start a session and provide
you with an ID and password.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11585f15.large.jpg"><img src="11585f15.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 15. With the help of a user, you can connect to any machine with
Internet access.
</p></div></div><p>
While the session is open, you not only can work remotely, but you also even
can perform special actions, such as rebooting the machine or locking your
helper out, so only you will be able to work. You won't need a Hacker's
Keyboard with this app, as the app can show a virtual overlaid keyboard,
which lets you simulate all keys, such as Ctrl, Alt and the Meta (or
Windows) key.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11585f16.large.jpg"><img src="11585f16.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 16. Working in low resolution, speeds can be acceptable even over
not-so-good connections.
</p></div></div><p>
There are some display method settings (for quality or for speed) that
can change the connection speed. Performance can be lower than with
VNC, but given that connection requirements are minimal (Web access),
this app may help you out in difficult cases.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x1a03070"></a>
Working with Files</h2></div></div><p>
Apart from directly connecting to a server, you may need to upload and
download files. (Of course, for just editing a file, a remote access
solution does the job, but you might prefer to download the file
to your tablet, edit it there with a better editor such as Jota+,
and then upload it again.) Out of many available file browsers, I find
ES File Explorer to be the most useful. You not only can browse local files
(even the &ldquo;/&rdquo; directory, on rooted devices), but you also can use several Web
protocols (SMB, FTP, FTPS, SFTP and WebDAV) and cloud services (Box,
DropBox, Google Drive, S3, Skydrive, SugarSync, Yandex and Ubuntu One),
working with remote files as if they were local to your device.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11585f17.large.jpg"><img src="11585f17.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 17. With ES File Explorer, you can connect to servers and cloud servers.
</p></div></div><p>
To connect to a remote server, choose &ldquo;Network&rdquo; in the left-hand list, then
&ldquo;FTP&rdquo;. Next, define its parameters: protocol (FTP, FTPS, SFTP
or WebDAV),
server, port, user name and password (leave these empty for anonymous
access), data encoding and display name. For secure connections, the
remote server will require the
<tt  >PasswordAuthentication</tt> SSH parameter
to be set to <tt  >Yes</tt>. (Note that this is also a requirement for other file
managers that are capable of SFTP access.) If you can't connect to the
server, edit its /etc/sshd/sshd_config file (the path and name
may vary depending on your distribution), change the appropriate line,
and restart the service with a <tt  >sudo /etc/init.d/sshd
reload</tt> command.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11585f18.large.jpg"><img src="11585f18.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 18. You can work with remote files as if they resided on your device.
</p></div></div><p>
Long-tap a defined server to edit it. Tap a server, and it will show
its directories and files, as if they were local. Long-tap a file,
and you can work with it (open, copy, cut, delete, rename, share, send
and more). If you need to make only a simple fix, opening a file as text
lets you edit it with a (rather basic) editor. Finally, you can select
several files at a time for group operations.
</p><p>
File browsers are widely available, well known and similar in function.
However, I find ES File Explorer to be a bit ahead of the others
because of the simple way it shows and works with remote directories
and files as if they were local, making work easier and faster.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Sysadmin work is never going to be really easy, but with the Android
apps I've shown here, you will be able to analyze networks, monitor servers
and services, detect problems as they happen, and connect to servers to
get things running again. Hopefully, your life will be a tad easier
than before.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x1914218"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Does Size Matter?</b></p><p>
These days, I'm completely Google-fied and going for stock Android:
my phone is a Nexus 5 and my tablet is a Nexus 7. (The tablet is Wi-Fi-only, but I can make do by tethering the phone as a portable hotspot.) As
a matter of course, I unlocked and rooted both devices, and I also added
a Hacker's Keyboard to them to get keys like Alt, Ctrl, Esc
and Tab.
</p><p>
If I had to choose to work with only one of the Nexus devices,
it would be a hard decision to make. The (small-ish) phone is more comfortable
to use and carry, lets me run quick server tests and receives alarms on
the go, all of which are a plus. But, the larger tablet is far better for
working with remote SSH or VNC connections, which require a lot of screen
space. So, I usually carry both devices, and I even work with both at the
same time, fixing things with the tablet and checking the results on the
phone&mdash;dual-screen sysadmin work! 
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x1914480"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Make Your Choices</b></p><p>
How do I choose apps? First, I prefer to get everything off the Google Play
store, so I can take into account the ratings, number of installs and
user reviews. To detect &ldquo;abandonware&rdquo;, the version number and, more
important, the date of the last app update are relevant. I also visit the
developer's Web site and look around. Does it look professional? Is
documentation provided for the app? Is there a way to 
communicate with the developer directly for questions or bug reports? If so,
does the developer answer quickly? 
</p><p>
For security reasons, I try to be
very careful with the permissions required by the app: are they logical
or do they look fishy? 
</p><p>
As for pricing, I (of course) like free apps better,
but even most paid apps also have a free version to try before updating
to the paid one, which works well for everybody. 
</p><p>
Finally, since there
usually are several overlapping apps for each function, I generally try my
hand at many of them before settling on one. I also periodically
check for new apps, because updates and new functions are usually frequent,
and apps previously left aside may become a new favorite. I have changed
tools several times and probably will continue doing so.

Federico Kereki is a Uruguayan systems engineer with more than 20 years of
experience developing systems, doing consulting work and teaching at
universities. He wrote the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Essential GWT</em></span> book, and he currently is
working with a good jumble of acronyms: SOA, GWT, Ajax, PHP and more. All
his computing machines run either Linux or Android, and he finds the
mixture quite appealing to his FLOSS interests! You can reach Federico at
