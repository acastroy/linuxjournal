Editors' Choice 2006</h1></div><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">LJ Staff</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #152, December 2006</div></div><div><p>
Excellent competition forced our editors to make some difficult decisions
for the 2006 Editors' Choice Awards for software, hardware and services.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18d3580.0x19cb0e0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Outside the open-source products that work on Windows as well as Linux,
Windows continues to evolve into a Microsoft-only platform, as Microsoft
continues to eliminate its commercial competition.  But, competition thrives
more than ever on Linux.  Pick just about any category of software, and
you can find at least two or three excellent candidates, often more.  And,
the available products are so good, it's difficult to claim that there
is a hands-down best, such as the definitive word processor or e-mail
client.  One's choice often boils down to personal taste.
</p><p>
Here's how we approached the task of selecting winners this year.  We asked vendors to nominate
the products they released this year.  We combined their nominations with
our own choices, and our editors chose the best of the best for each
category.  If there's a flaw in our nomination process, it is that
it is sometimes impossible for our editors to try out every product or
service in the list of nominations.  This is especially true of things like
hosting and colocation services.  In cases like these, personal experience
had to trump vendor claims.  For example, there may be a better
hosting service than the one that earned our award, but we can
vouch for our choice from personal experience, which carries more weight.
</p><p>
In the end, the process was fun, despite the challenge.  We hope some
of your favorites captured top honors, or if not, managed to get an
honorable mention.  So, on with the show.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18d3580.0x19cb298"></a>
Linux Distribution</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
Ubuntu 6.06</b></span>
</p><p>
It was at once the easiest and most difficult decision to pick the
distribution for the Editors' Choice.  Ubuntu has a long list of features
and design decisions to recommend it for our award.  It is easy to
install; it has a vast repository of software; it is stable and friendly;
it protects users from logging in as root by default and much more.  One
of the most influential factors in our decision was the fact that Ubuntu
has captured and held more popular interest than any other distribution
almost since its release.  Granted, this isn't a people's choice award, but
it's not for nothing that Ubuntu is such a popular distribution.  Many of
us at <i  >Linux Journal</i> run it, or its KDE-based sister Kubuntu, ourselves.
</p><p>
Nevertheless, the competition is so superb that a proper list of honorable
mentions would be uncomfortably long.  We should consider ourselves blessed
that we have such a marvelous variety from which to choose.  Although we
can't name every distribution we could consider worthy of the Editors'
Choice Award, we can't resist giving honorable mention to a few.  Novell's SUSE
Linux Enterprise 10 is arguably the strongest comprehensive commercial
distribution available.  Linspire could be the ultimate desktop-oriented
distribution for new users, although Xandros gives it a run for its money.
Gentoo is the definitive compile-it-yourself distribution.  Debian
deserves a long round of applause, especially since many of the most
excellent distributions, including Ubuntu/Kubuntu, Linspire, Xandros,
MEPIS, Knoppix and many more are based on Debian.  rPath uses Fedora as
the foundation for its roll-it-yourself distribution&mdash;a perfect choice
for those who need to produce custom appliance-like distributions.  Even
Damn Small Linux deserves a mention for being one of the few distributions
that still runs well on older hardware.
</p><p>
As difficult a decision as it was, however, we're more than satisfied
with our choice of Ubuntu 6.06 for the Editors' Choice of 2006.

Desktop Environment</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
KDE 3.5.4</b></span>
</p><p>
KDE is the desktop with everything.  It is friendly, intuitive and simple
enough for the casual user who wants to use it as-is, but it also packs
nearly unlimited features and configurability for those who want to plumb
the depths of its power.  For example, click on the default Konqueror
button, and it takes you to a default page with links to your home folder,
network folders, applications, trash bin and storage media.  Click on
the home folder link, and you get a simple, intuitive, folder-based
file manager.
</p><p>
That would be enough for most people, but power users who want more from
Konqueror can open a navigation panel, split windows multiple times,
open tabbed panels&mdash;there's almost no limit to what you can do.  You
can use the fish: kio-slave to view and manipulate files on another
computer over a secure connection.  And, when you're happy with a view
into your own filesystem or that of another computer, you can save any
combination of URI and window configuration as a profile you can
restore instantly.
</p><p>
Or, as another example, you can pop an audio CD into your CD drive, and
Konqueror opens a window with virtual folders of your songs in MP3,
Ogg Vorbis and other formats (depending on which extensions you have
installed).  Ripping your songs to MP3 format is as simple as copying
and pasting the virtual MP3 files to another folder or to your MP3 player.
</p><p>
According to research organizations such as Evans Data, KDE is the most
popular desktop environment.  How does that square with the fact that
GNOME is the default desktop of one of the most popular distributions
(Ubuntu)? We have no idea.  Whether or not Ubuntu users are sticking
with GNOME or installing KDE, GNOME certainly deserves an honorable
mention on its own merits.  GNOME has come a long way in recent times,
and it is particularly appealing in its default Ubuntu configuration.
</p><p>
GNOME was first to integrate the Beagle search engine into the
desktop.  Beagle is a Mono-based adaptation of the Java-based Lucene
search engine.  It is capable of indexing files of a wide variety of
formats, so you can search through the contents of those files
almost instantly.  KDE has a search tool called Kerry, which is the
equivalent of the GNOME search tool.  Although GNOME should get credit for
introducing the feature, KDE's power is made more apparent by how KDE
easily integrates Beagle into Konqueror as a kio-slave.  Put simply,
you can type <tt  >beagle:ubuntu</tt> in the Konqueror location bar (where you
might type a file path or Web URL), and Konqueror taps into the Beagle
search index to find all files containing the word ubuntu.  All the
files found will show up in the Konqueror window as icons and previews.

Office Suite</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>OpenOffice.org 2.0.3</b></span>
</p><p>
There's a joke among musicians that Beethoven wrote only three
symphonies:
the third, the fifth and the ninth.  These three eclipse the rest in
terms of popularity such that most people are unaware the other
symphonies exist.  So it is with OpenOffice.org.  OpenOffice.org is so
popular, it eclipses the competition to the point that many people are
unaware there is competition.
</p><p>
For example, Evermore Software's EIOffice suite has superior live links
and duplicates the Microsoft Office interface almost exactly, but it
is not open source, and it isn't marketed aggressively enough such that
many people know it exists.  KDE's KOffice suite is a powerful suite of
productivity applications, but it is often overlooked because it doesn't
attempt to mimic Microsoft Office.
</p><p>
OpenOffice.org delivers just the right combination of openness, power
and similarity to Microsoft Office that it provides the features and
familiarity people want in an office suite without the drawbacks of
proprietary document format or proprietary code.  It may not always
import Microsoft Office files perfectly, but it does so without the
crashes that sometimes plague suites like EIOffice when importing large,
complex Microsoft Office files.  Overall, OpenOffice.org has a
way to go before it reaches its potential, but it still provides the
best combination of features and compatibility, along with the distinct
advantage of being an open-source project.
</p><p>

Spreadsheet</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
OpenOffice.org 2.0.3 Calc</b></span>
</p><p>
OpenOffice.org Calc makes good on the same formula that has made the
entire suite so successful.  It is an excellent blend of power and
compatibility with Microsoft Office, and it has the added bonus of being
based on open source and open document formats.  Gnumeric and KSpread
deserve honorable mentions, but if you're really serious about doing
spreadsheet work, your best bet is with OpenOffice.org Calc.

Word Processor</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
AbiWord 2.4.4</b></span>
</p><p>
Here is where we break tradition and give the Editors' Choice Award to
a productivity application that doesn't appear in the OpenOffice.org
suite.  Some of us just want to do word processing.  We don't use
spreadsheets or create presentations, so it isn't important to have
a full office suite.  We want a word processor that is lean and mean,
starts up faster than OpenOffice.org Writer, imports Microsoft Word
files adequately and offers all the features we need.
</p><p>
Two word processors fit the bill nicely: KWord and AbiWord.  We could
justify giving either of these the Editors' Choice Award.  We went with AbiWord
2.4.4 primarily because it has a slightly more familiar look and feel
for Microsoft Word users, and because it sports a number of very useful
plugins.  For example, one plugin allows you to place the cursor on a
word and run a Google search on that word.  Another lets you look up
the word in Wikipedia.  Still another is supposed to translate selected
text via Babel Fish, although that plugin wasn't fully automated in
our experiment.  Still other plugins add the ability to read and write
various document formats, including OpenOffice.org Writer files and
Microsoft Word.
</p><p>
AbiWord has all of what most people will need in a word processor and
then some, without the bloat and long load times of OpenOffice.org Writer.

Presentation Software</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
OpenOffice.org 2.0.3 Impress</b></span>
</p><p>
   We came back to OpenOffice.org for our choice of presentation software.
As with the spreadsheet and the entire suite, it offers that optimal
balance of features, power and familiarity for those who want to migrate
from Microsoft Office.  And, of course, it has the oh-so-important
benefit of being open source and supporting an open document format.
KPresenter deserves an honorable mention, as does the presentation module
in EIOffice.

Web Browser</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Firefox 1.5.0.6</b></span>
</p><p>
Is there really any other choice but Firefox? Actually, there are good
alternatives.  Konqueror is reportedly faster than Firefox.  Opera is no
slouch in terms of speed and features either.  But, after all is said and
done, Firefox is the clear winner, and one of the easiest decisions we had
to make for Editors' Choice.  How do you beat a browser that can please
virtually everyone? Choose your favorite theme and add a few extensions,
and you can make it look exactly the way you want it to look and
do just about anything a browser can do.
</p><p>
Firefox is easy to use, easy to install, speedy, compliant with standards
and compatible across different platforms.  As we mentioned, it has a huge
number of extensions that allow you to customize it for your own tastes
and needs.  Do you want to synchronize bookmarks from one platform
to another? Grab an extension, and you can use commercial bookmark
storage or your own server as the central repository for your bookmarks,
depending on the extension you choose.  Install another extension to
manage all your passwords.  Install yet another extension to have Firefox
check your Gmail or Yahoo accounts.  Some favorite geek extensions are
Web developer, Book Burro (to feed your used-book-buying habit),
Firebug (for modern JavaScript debugging), Flashblock (to stop Flash
animation from starting until you want it to), Session Saver (to return
to the same set of windows) and Greasemonkey (for client-side JavaScript
programs).  There is practically no limit to what you can do with Firefox.

Mail Client</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Thunderbird 1.5.0.5</b></span>
</p><p>
It may be a no-brainer to pick Firefox for Editors' Choice, but the
decision to elect its sister mail program, Thunderbird, was far more
difficult.  There's no lack of good e-mail clients for Linux.  Evolution
and Kontact are not only excellent e-mail clients, they include calendars
and other nice features&mdash;not that features make the e-mail client.  Heck,
some of us at <i  >Linux Journal</i> still think the character-based Mutt is the
bee's knees.
</p><p>
We ended up choosing Thunderbird for some of the same reasons we picked
Firefox&mdash;extensibility.  You may be satisfied with Thunderbird right
&ldquo;out
of the box&rdquo;.  But are you frustrated when you get an e-mail with a URL that
is broken into several lines so that you can't just click on it to bring
up the Web page? Install the URL Link Thunderbird extension&mdash;problem
solved.  Is the default spam filter for Thunderbird failing to catch all
your spam? Install the Spamato4Thunderbird extension&mdash;problem solved.
Although there aren't as many extensions for Thunderbird as there are for
Firefox, and the best expansion is yet to come (the Lightning calendar
extension is still in the works).  There's enough flexibility in what
you can do with Thunderbird to make it suit almost any taste.
</p><p>
Nevertheless, we gladly award honorable mentions to Evolution, Kontact
and, yes, even Mutt.

Database</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
PostgreSQL 8.1.4</b></span>
</p><p>
Time to put on our flame-retardant suits.  How could we pick any database
other than MySQL? MySQL is the M in the LAMP stack.  Much of the Web
practically runs on MySQL.  But, we continue to be most impressed by the
open-source PostgreSQL.  It handles everything we throw at it and just keeps
working, flawlessly.  It's almost invisible from an administrative
perspective.  It handles huge quantities of data, and it has all of the
goodies that we expect in a relational database (such as referential
integrity, column-level constraints and checks, server-side functions,
subselects and unions).  The original 8.1 release, which came out in
November 2005, included a number of new features, such as two-phase
commits.  We can't recommend PostgreSQL highly enough.
</p><p>
Having said all that, MySQL certainly deserves an honorable mention
at the very least.  It is a staple and deservedly so.

Game/Entertainment Software</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Quake 4</em></span></b></span>
</p><p>
This AAA (top-tier) game title offers a native Linux client with no
compromises from the Windows version, so Linux users aren't getting a
second-class product.  id Software has released Linux versions for all
versions of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span> and later versions of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span>, which will hopefully catch
the attention of other major game publishers.

Linux users to play popular, non-Linux AAA titles, such as <span   class="emphasis"><em>World of
Warcraft</em></span> on Linux without having to dual boot.

Security Tool</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Novell AppArmor</b></span>
</p><p>
AppArmor strikes a reasonable balance between the complexity and power of
SELinux and Linux's default &ldquo;winner/root takes all&rdquo; security model.  With
its wizard-based setup tools (integrated into SUSE's YaST system
administration GUI), AppArmor makes it easy even for nonsecurity geeks
to strengthen their mission-critical applications with kernel-level
mandatory access controls.
</p><p>
AppArmor is included in recent versions of SUSE Linux, including the free
OpenSUSE distribution.  Although at present AppArmor runs only on SUSE,
Novell
has released AppArmor's source code (which it acquired from Immunix)
licensed under the GPL.  Efforts are underway to port it to Ubuntu
(and therefore also Debian); other ports should follow.
</p><p>
PacketFence deserves a mention here too.  Finally, we have a
well-structured tool that combines the power of many open-source components
to do network policy enforcement.

Language</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Ruby 1.8.5</b></span>
</p><p>
Not since Python has any language captured the imagination of so many
eager programmers.  Ruby is an object-oriented scripting language that
is natural, easy to work with and, well, fun.  Ruby on Rails expanded
the awareness of Ruby as a language, and now Sun has blessed JRuby
(Ruby implemented in Java) by hiring two JRuby developers to work on it
full-time.  The bottom line is: Ruby is going places, and it is likely
to be headed for explosive popularity.  People who want in on the fun
should grab a copy and start learning it, lest they get left behind when
the revolution comes.
</p><p>
Some of our editors would stage a revolt if we didn't give honorable
mentions to Objective-C, Perl and Python.

Web Server</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Apache 2.2</b></span>
</p><p>
Are there really any other serious contenders for Editors' Choice of Web
server for Linux systems? There are other open-source alternatives,
such as the AOL server, but Apache still enjoys the most language and
module support.  It may be the extensions and add-ons that make Apache
interesting as a Web development platform, but as Apache is the de facto
standard engine of choice, it would be hard to justify giving any other
Web server the Editors' Choice Award.  Lighttpd deserves an honorable mention.
It is becoming popular for its good FCGI support, which is used in Ruby
on Rails.

Web Application Framework</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Ruby on Rails 1.1.6</b></span>
</p><p>
Not only has Ruby on Rails skyrocketed in its acceptance during the last
few years, but people who use it generally fall head over heels in love
with it.  Some developers say they look at old Web applications they
wrote using other frameworks and almost start crying when they discover
that Rails could have eliminated 50&ndash;70% of the code that went
into those projects.

Software Development Tool</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Eclipse 3.2</b></span>
</p><p>
Eclipse is a Java-based extensible integrated development environment
(IDE).  According to several Evans Data Corporation surveys, it is the most
popular development environment among professional Linux developers.  To
say that Eclipse is extensible is almost an understatement.  There are
plugins to make Eclipse do just about everything except groom your dog
(although we hear that plugin is in the works).
</p><p>
Another honorable mention goes to VMware Workstation 5.5.  Virtualization
has revolutionized the way we test and provision operating systems, and
VMware is still the most mature, versatile and easy-to-use cross-platform
virtualization environment.  VMware has a long history of working as
well or better on Linux hosts as on Windows.  And, nowadays it's free too.  VMware has made VMware Server (though not VMware Workstation)
a free download.

</p><p>
Asterisk is an open-source, complete Private Branch Exchange (PBX) with
a list of features that won't quit.  It is currently maintained by the
Debian VoIP Team and sponsored by hardware vendor Digium.  Digium makes
hardware that works with Asterisk, but Asterisk works with hardware other

<span   class="bold"><b>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Ajax Design Patterns</em></span> by Michael Mahemoff</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Ajax Design Patterns</em></span>, published by O'Reilly, assumes that you have a
good idea of how HTTP, HTML, the DOM and CSS work (although it does
help you brush up as necessary), and it shows you how to combine the basics
into sophisticated applications.  You can almost think of it as an Ajax
cookbook, but with the underlying theory and advice that you need to
make interesting applications.

End-User or Nontechnical Book</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Beginning Ubuntu Linux: From Novice to Professional</em></span>
by Keir Thomas</b></span>
</p><p>
What better complement to the Editors' Choice for Linux distribution
than a book on how to use that distribution? This book by Keir Thomas,
published by Apress, is such a handy resource that we published a sample
chapter in our October 2006 issue.

Graphics Software</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Autodesk Maya 8</b></span>
</p><p>
Autodesk Maya is an integrated 3-D modeling, animation and rendering
solution.  It rendered the animation and special effects for movies such as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em></span>.  Version 8 is the first full release of Maya
that runs on 64-bit Linux, a milestone that makes the software even more
compelling.  If Maya 8 is out of reach of your budget and/or ambitions,
Toon Boom Animation, Inc.  (<a href="http://www.toonboom.com" target="_self">www.toonboom.com</a>) sells
a wide variety of
2-D and 3-D animation software, with packages for home users to studio
professionals.  The Toon Boom products are all available for Linux.
Any of these could have been our second choice.

Hosting or Colocation</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Johncompanies</b></span>
</p><p>
Our Editor has used Johncompanies for years and testifies that they're
wonderful.  No technical question is too hard for them.  It's a bit
creepy that you don't know much about the company other than the name
of the head honcho (John) and the Linux technical support person
(Dave).  Even the sales staff goes by JC Sales.  And, instead of a Web
or e-mail ticketing system, they simply answer e-mail, which seems like it
shouldn't work.  But in the time that our editor has been using
Johncompanies,
it has been competent, friendly and helpful, surpassing
other hosting services by a very large degree.

Management or Admin Software</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Mantis Bug Tracking System 1.0.5</b></span>
</p><p>
When thinking of management or administration software, bug tracking
might not immediately pop into mind.  But the Mantis Bug Tracking system
can be invaluable in a corporate environment where much of the company
relies on in-house development to keep the business afloat.  Mantis is
a PHP Web-based tool that is easy to install, intuitive to use and
handles multiple projects.

Mobile Device</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Funambol</b></span>
</p><p>
Funambol isn't actually a mobile device, but we chose to give it the
Editors' Choice if for no other reason than to avoid plugging the Nokia
770 yet again.  Funambol is an open-source SyncML server that acts as
a middleware between groupware servers and mobile devices.  It supports
the most popular PDAs and commodity mobile phones.  It's great, and the
community is finally coming up with a solution that rivals the best
commercial competition.  Check out the Web site for more information.

Notebook</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Lenovo ThinkPad T Series</b></span>
</p><p>
The Lenovo ThinkPad models from the T series are relatively inexpensive,
durably built, and the driver support in Linux is very good.  Wireless
and wired network support, video and sound work well with most recent
distributions out there.  These laptops run solidly for years and perform
very well.

POP/IMAP/SMTP E-Mail Server</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
CommuniGate Pro 5.1</b></span>
</p><p>
CommuniGate Pro 5.1 is a comprehensive Internet communications system
that encompasses IMAP, POP, SMTP, groupware and even includes a VoIP PBX.
CommuniGate Pro always has been one of the easiest servers to manage, and
that ease of use has been extended to its new VoIP capabilities.  It is a
cinch to create outgoing messages, voice menu systems, call conferencing,
caller-ID blocking and much more.  It is outrageously simple to set
up CommuniGate Pro clusters, making it one of easiest solutions for
situations where scalability is important.  Of course, it supports the
gamut of e-mail features, including LDAP directories, Web mail, hooks
into antivirus software and spam blockers, and an easily configurable
set of filters.  If you're allergic to proprietary commercial software,
you'll want to avoid this one, but you'll have to put in a lot of
time and effort to duplicate with open source what you can get so easily
with CommuniGate Pro.
</p><p>
The Gordano Messaging Suite (<a href="http://www.gordano.com" target="_self">www.gordano.com</a>) is a commercial
Exchange replacement alternative that features instant messaging,
collaboration, mobile gateway and archive/recovery.  If you want an
open-source solution, Open-Xchange Server 5 (<a href="http://www.open-xchange.com" target="_self">www.open-xchange.com</a>)
deserves the honorable mention.  Open-Xchange server is a terrific
open-source drop-in replacement for Microsoft Exchange.  It's a classy
product for what it delivers.  Although it is open source, it is not free.
In fact, a year's subscription to the maintenence portal for 25 users,
at $1,095 US, is more expensive than the more feature-rich and scalable
25-user CommuniGate Pro server, which sells for $699 US.

Software Library or Module</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Yahoo UI (YUI) Library</b></span>
</p><p>
Under normal circumstances, Qt 4 would be a shoe-in for Editors'
Choice in this category.  Considering how important Ajax has become
to development, we chose the rich library released to open source by
Yahoo.  It is a comprehensive library of components, utilities, controls
and CSS resources for the Ajax and Web services developer.
</p><p>
The Google Web Toolkit (<a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit" target="_self">code.google.com/webtoolkit</a>) was a close second.
Google released a lot of its resources under open source, although a few
goodies are still missing.  For example, the hooks are there to create
something like the drag-and-drop gadgets you can assemble on your personal
Google page, but we suspect Google has some unreleased code to make this
much easier than what you have to do to make it work with the currently
released GWT.
</p><p>
Honorable mention goes to Prototype (<a href="http://prototype.conio.net" target="_self">prototype.conio.net</a>), a JavaScript
library that makes it easy and fun to work with JavaScript.  Prototype
has become famous in part because of its inclusion in Ruby on Rails.
But, you can use Prototype without Rails, and Prototype itself is the
basis for some higher-level projects and libraries, such as Scriptaculous.
If you work with JavaScript, you should check out Prototype.

<span class="emphasis"><em>LPI Linux Certification in a Nutshell</em></span>, Second
Edition, by Steven Pritchard, Bruno Gomes Pessanha, Nicolai Langfeldt,

</p><p>
This O'Reilly book can help you pass your LPI exams or just assist your
progress toward being a better Linux system administrator.  We'd love to
give honorable mention to two other O'Reilly books: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Server Security</em></span>,
Second Edition, by our own Michael D.  Bauer, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Server
Hacks</em></span>,
Volume Two, by William von Hagen and Brian K. Jones, but both books were
released in 2005.
