Use LyX to create stellar on-line books for the Lulu publishing service.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130a580.0x1402298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Writers are everywhere.  They can be in school, in business or trying to
make a living printing text on the page.  The Internet abounds with
various Microsoft Windows tools to aid in writing books, transcripts and
other media.  Many of these sites and programs still rely on traditional
word-processing programs for output.
</p><p>
LyX is different.  It's a typesetting tool designed on LaTeX.  In short, LyX
makes your printed documents look more like what comes from a professional
publishing company.  Lulu.com is a fast-growing Web site where you can publish
that book you've been meaning to write for the last ten years.
</p><p>
Together, LyX and Lulu make a great pair.  Although they can't fix your poor
writing habits, they will make your final publication look professionally
printed and bound.
</p><p>
This is part one of a two-part series.  In this first article, I
explain some of the striking benefits of LyX and how to get your final
document into the
Lulu.com Web site.  The next article will focus on using Pixel to create your
final book cover for the publication.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130a580.0x14024a8"></a>
What's LaTeX?</h2></div></div><p>
LaTeX is a typesetting system, not a word processor.  Word processors
fit nicely in the business world, because they give command of fancy document
layout to the end user.  They also have other tools you expect, such as
spell checkers or an automated thesaurus.
</p><p>
LaTeX did not impress me at first.  Its raw form is ugly and difficult
to understand.  Just looking at the text, you cannot realize what it will
look like in final printed form.  Consider the following text example
from the LaTeX Web site:

<pre     class="programlisting">
\documentclass{article}
\title{Cartesian closed categories and the price of eggs}
\author{Jane Doe}
\date{September 1994}
\begin{document}
   \maketitle
   Hello world!
\end{document}
</pre>
</p><p>
This is what you need to type into a text editor for LaTeX to render a
graphical output.  But what you get after using LaTeX is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Cartesian closed categories and the price of eggs
Jane Doe
September 1994

Hello world!
</pre>
</p><p>
So what's the big deal with the output? I'll admit in short documents,
it is not easy to see a difference with LaTeX typesetting.  However, in
longer published works, you begin to see the subtle differences expand
dramatically.
</p><p>
Looking closer, you will find LaTeX treats printed output with refined
precision.  Specifically, the kerning, letter spacing and layout
is different from what comes out of a word processor.  Consider
Figures 1 and 2 from <a href="http://dartar.free.fr/w/?wakka=latex" target="_self">dartar.free.fr/w/?wakka=latex</a>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9085f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9085f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2.  The Word Table Processed by LyX/LaTeX&mdash;Adjusted Kerning for
the Ta Letter Pair
</p></div></div><p>
As you can see in Figures 1 and 2, the kerning between characters is
slightly different.  One word does not make a big difference, but
a whole page of text does.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130a580.0x1402be0"></a>
What LyX Does</h2></div></div><p>
As you can see from the previous example, LaTeX is ugly to work with in
plain-text format.  The commands provide fine-looking output, but no one
wants to key these in by hand.  To fix this problem, several
popular LaTeX editing programs are available to do the command formatting
for you.
</p><p>
LyX is a GUI document-processing front end for LaTeX.  With LyX, you
can key in the text and let the program organize how it looks on paper.
LyX calls this the What You See Is What You Mean (WYSIWN) way of document
processing&mdash;meaning you don't need to play with formatting the document.
You focus on what you're writing and let the LyX commands do the work of making
it look good.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130a580.0x1402d40"></a>
Where to Get LyX?</h2></div></div><p>
LyX is likely in the repository of your Linux distribution.  So, all you
probably need to do is use your package manager to install the program, and
you're ready to begin.  If LyX is not in the repository, you can download
and install it from <a href="http://www.lyx.org" target="_self">www.lyx.org</a>.
</p><p>
Besides the LyX package, it's also important to download and install a
spell-checking program, such as ispell or aspell.  Again, use your package
manager to install these.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130a580.0x1402ef8"></a>
Starting LyX</h2></div></div><p>
Prepare yourself&mdash;the starting screen of LyX appears stark compared to a
typical word processor (Figure 3).  Remember, it's not a word processor;
it's a text publishing system.  LyX won't disappoint you in its capability
for delivering good results.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9085f3.large.jpg"><img src="9085f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3.  LyX Starting Page
</p></div></div><p>
Before going further, set up some defaults applicable to your
environment.  First, go to Layout&rarr;Document (Figure 4).  Here you need
to define what document you are creating.  For this two-part series, we
work with the book class in 8.5x11 US Letter.  After selecting
the book class, select Paper, as shown in Figure 5. Use the drop-down list
to find US Letter.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9085f4.large.jpg"><img src="9085f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4.  Choose Document to change the characteristics of the whole
document.

Figure 5.  For the right paper size, I chose US Letter.
</p></div></div><p>
Next, include either ispell or aspell as the assigned spell
checker for LyX.  Go to Edit&rarr;Preferences, and select Spellchecker under
Language Settings.  In Figure 6, I have selected aspell as the spell checker
for LyX.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9085f6.large.jpg"><img src="9085f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6.  Select aspell or ispell for spell checking.
</p></div></div><p>
Finally, review the document converters installed with LyX.
Look further down the Preferences screen, and you will see Converters.
Select this, and make sure your distribution lists the proper .dvi and
.pdf programs in the right location (Figure 7).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9085f7.large.jpg"><img src="9085f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7.  Some distributions (like Kubuntu) have the right converters
installed by the package manager.
</p></div></div><p>
When finished, you must reconfigure LyX for it to work properly.  Go to
Edit&rarr;Reconfigure, then restart LyX.  Now you're ready to learn this powerful
program.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130a580.0x14039f8"></a>
Writing Your Book</h2></div></div><p>
At this point, you're ready to start entering text.  Although it's best
to get a good understanding of how LyX works first, so you can lay out
the final text properly.
</p><p>
Go to Help&rarr;Tutorial, and LyX loads the tutorial into the working
screen.  Read through the LyX Tutorial, and follow the instructions for
creating your first document.  The tutorial is easy to understand, and
completing the exercises will get you familiar with the program.
</p><p>
I know most of us will prefer the Quick Start Tutorial&mdash;so here it is.
Go to File&rarr;New and create a new file.  Type some sample text on the
first line, as shown in Figure 8.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9085f8.large.jpg"><img src="9085f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8.  Using the sample text, choose Title to assign the proper
format.
</p></div></div><p>
Remember, LyX handles what you want the text to look like on paper based
on the assigned document class. So, to create a title page, all you need
to do is select Title from the drop-down list.  LyX marks these words
as the book title, and you're done.  Now if you press Ctrl-D, LyX
exports the text into a .dvi file and displays your results on-screen.
Notice that LyX has centered the text, added the date below the title and
turned it into its own separate page&mdash;pretty cool.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130a580.0x17fc068"></a>
LyX Features</h2></div></div><p>
Like a word processor, LyX has a few features to help you produce your
final work.  Academic math people use LyX because it can produce complex
formulas fairly easily in printed documents.  Doctoral students also use
it to conform to standards for their final dissertations.
</p><p>
I find using the mouse awkward when writing.  Consequently, I prefer
to use command keys and other shortcuts to format text in LyX.
LyX comes with a lot of documentation; however, finding answers to your questions
can take some looking.  A LyX help file titled customization.lyx
describes various command keys and bindings to help speed up typing.
Print out the file and look through the existing key bindings; they will
improve your speed with document processing and keep your focus on what
you're writing.
</p><p>
Also, keep in mind that entering a carriage return does not translate
into an extra line in LyX.  I'll admit, letting the program handle the
formatting is unnerving at first, but the results will please you.
</p><p>
LyX automatically creates links to specific parts of the text file.  Figure
9 shows how LyX builds a navigation tree based on the text in the
document.  This is similar to the Outline feature in other word processors
and is handy for editing large files.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9085f9.large.jpg"><img src="9085f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9.  Use the drop-down menus to move through your document quickly.
</p></div></div><p>
Like a word processor, LyX handles tables and graphics with ease.
To add a table, go to Insert&rarr;Tabular Material, and define the table size.
Use the Insert drop-down list to place graphics in the document.  As an
alternative, you can click on the associated icons below the toolbar
for graphics, tables and to alter text justification.
</p><p>
Finally, LyX has superior ability to handle cross references, citations
and footnotes.  While typing, use the Insert drop-down list to add
footnotes, citations or cross-reference markers.  Each has its own
window for the text entered.  To keep from viewing them, click the
inserted icon, and they disappear off-screen.  LyX automatically adjusts
the output to keep the footnotes on the proper page.
</p><p>
LyX is powerful, and the documentation is lengthy&mdash;too large to cover
in this short article.  No doubt, using LyX is uncomfortable at first,
but the benefits of letting the program sort out the document formatting
are profound.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130a580.0x17fc538"></a>
Lulu&mdash;A Self-Publishing Giant</h2></div></div><p>
If you haven't heard, Lulu.com (<a href="http://lulu.com" target="_self">lulu.com</a>) is a Web site for
self-publishing.  That's right, you can write your own books, articles,
handouts and more.  Once it's complete, send your written material
to Lulu and select how you want it to be published.
</p><p>
With Lulu, users can choose various publication sizes and bindings.  As
the author, you can decide whether to glue, staple or stitch the final work.
In addition, Lulu even offers hardcover binding.
</p><p>
Further, authors can publish and promote their books directly through
Lulu.  Lulu has an on-line store where you can browse by subject matter
and author.  If you want, you even can publish your work as a downloadable
book.
</p><p>
As the author, you don't pay anything ahead of time.  People who want to
buy your work pay a preselected fee, and Lulu takes a cut of the price.
Check out Lulu.com for pricing details.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130a580.0x17fc7a0"></a>
A Step Above</h2></div></div><p>
I think it's likely that most of Lulu's authors use a word processor for
their publications.  Lulu's help system even provides examples on how
to lay out your work from within Microsoft Word and OpenOffice.org.  So,
using LyX to publish your work will strengthen the professional look of
your documents.  Thus, even if you write badly, it'll look great.
</p><p>
Lulu.com is a helpful Web site, and authors can upload their work in many
different file types.  I think the safest way to maintain your work is
to use .pdf or .dvi files for upload.  This way, you're sure to maintain
the nice typesetting look LyX provides.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130a580.0x17fc900"></a>
The Process</h2></div></div><p>
Go to Lulu.com, and sign up for a free account.  Then, look
through the wide variety of products it offers.  For extra fees, you can
have Lulu.com help you with the layout of the book and cover design as well.
</p><p>
As a test, I used the LyX tutorial to see how well Lulu works.  I exported
the file in .pdf format (Figure 10) and used the on-line Lulu instructions
to send my file.  After Lulu accepts the document, it prompts you to select
the binding type, color content and finally the cover design.  When you're
finished, you can preview the cover of your book and order a copy for
final proofreading in the polished format.  Each step of the way, Lulu
calculates the price of your publication, so you can tailor it for the
intended audience.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9085f10.large.jpg"><img src="9085f10.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130a580.0x17fcc18"></a>
Lulu Options</h2></div></div><p>
Lulu gives you several choices for publications.  You can keep your uploaded
documents private for only you to view, or you can release them for public
purchase.  You decide on the sale price.
</p><p>
As a consultant, I must keep client files and reports so only I can
view them.  Then, I order just the right amount for the project.  After
I'm done with the client work, I delete it from Lulu and keep one copy
for myself in electronic format.
</p><p>
To get the word out on a self-published book, Lulu offers fee-based
services through selected third-party vendors.  But wait, this may not
be necessary, because in my next article, I'm going to write how to custom create
your book cover with Pixel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130a580.0x17fcdd0"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
There are many locations on the Internet where you can find tutorials and
examples of LyX and LaTeX.  Many are difficult to read and understand.  My
experience is that working with a few documents and following the guidance
in the tutorials is enough to get you started with the program.
</p><p>
Moreover, since I've been using LyX, I get many comments on how
professional the writing looks.  As mentioned earlier, the benefits of
LaTeX typesetting are really noticeable in larger documents.  I think
Lulu is a super partner for a good desktop typesetting program.  It handles
many text formats with ease, and professional binding always looks nice.
</p><p>
So go ahead, write that book you always wanted to write, and make it a
best-seller with LyX and Lulu.
