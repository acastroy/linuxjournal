Set up a virtual host for e-mail on your virtual private server.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf1580.0x1de9298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Would you like to have a dedicated server at an ISP, for the price of
a mere virtual hosting account? For most Linux users, the answer is
certainly, yes.  You want root access to your own box and the ability
to run the software that you choose&mdash;even if the budget calls for
virtual hosting.
</p><p>
In this case, the solution is a Virtual Private Server (VPS).  VPS accounts
effectively partition a physical computer's resources into several virtual
machines.  You get root access to your VPS and configure it just like
you would a dedicated server.
</p><p>
Of course, the flexibility of a VPS comes at the price of increased
complexity.  You are the system administrator of your VPS, not your
ISP.  The correct operation of the virtual
machine&mdash;particularly security&mdash;is your responsibility.
</p><p>
The typical VPS account holder, however, needs to support only a small
number of users, with a few relatively simple services.  This makes
the task of administering the system much easier.  If you are at least
somewhat comfortable with managing a Linux machine from the command line,
you should be able to make a successful transition to a VPS account.
</p><p>
In this article, we focus our attention on the most critical
aspect of switching to a VPS from virtual hosting&mdash;getting your
e-mail working.  E-mail is one of the most important communication tools
today.  With the exception of DNS, it is also the most complex service
you are likely to encounter.  Learning how to get your e-mail working
should give you a good overall sense of how to manage your VPS.
</p><p>
With respect to DNS, you may want your VPS provider to handle it for you
entirely, at least in the beginning.  Ask about the additional fees before
you sign up.  They should be a few extra dollars per year.  Some domain
name registrars and third parties also can provide you with DNS service.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf1580.0x1de9558"></a>
Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>
We use the VPS service provided by <span   class="emphasis"><em>tummy.com</em></span> to implement
and test our e-mail solution.  Its VPS accounts are based on Red Hat's
Fedora by default, but you easily can choose Debian instead during the
sign-up process.  We use the Fedora-based VPS for this article&mdash;Fedora Core 3 at the time of writing.  Some of the steps shown in the
following discussion are specific to Fedora, but most are applicable to
any recent Linux distribution.
Updates for more recent Linux distributions are available at <a href="../152/9380.html" target="_self">/article/9380</a>.  There is a corrections notice
at the start of that document&mdash;just keep reading past it to get to the updates.
</p><p>
Here are some names that you will see in the examples.  Your VPS
hostname is <tt  >myvps</tt>, your workstation is <tt  >ws</tt>, your first
            domain name is <tt  >first.domain</tt>, and your second domain name is
                  <tt  >second.domain</tt>.  Your user name on your workstation is <tt  >usera</tt>,
                  and the mail users on the VPS are <tt  >maila</tt> and <tt  >mailb</tt>.
</p><p>
Additional domain names beyond the first one are optional&mdash;only remember
to delete all references to <tt  >second.domain</tt> when you use any of the
code from the article.  You also can host more than two domain
names&mdash;simply configure them in the same way as <tt  >second.domain</tt> is configured in
the examples.
</p><p>
Of course, the actual domain names that you use should be valid and
registered to you.  For example, my <tt  >first.domain</tt> is <tt  >openlight.com</tt>.  You
also can call your VPS and workstation anything you want.  Now,
let's begin.
</p><p>
Log in to your new VPS account as root with <tt  >ssh
root@MY.VPS.IP.ADDRESS</tt>.  You
would have already chosen your root password when you signed up for the
account, and your VPS provider should have given you the IP address of
your virtual machine.
</p><p>
One of the first tasks when you set up a new Linux server is to
configure the built-in <span   class="emphasis"><em>iptables</em></span>
firewall.  Your VPS provider may have set reasonable defaults,
but you should always verify this yourself.
</p><p>
On the Fedora Linux distribution, run the following command:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">[root@myvps ~]# system-config-securitylevel-tui</pre><p>
You can now move from one control to another with the cursor keys.  Use
the spacebar to activate buttons and toggle check boxes.  Make sure that
the <tt  >Security Level</tt> is set to <tt  >Enabled</tt>.  Then, activate the <tt  >Customize</tt>
button.
</p><p>
On the next screen, you must enable <tt  >SSH</tt>, <tt  >WWW</tt> and <tt  >Mail</tt>.  <span   class="emphasis"><em>Do
not enable any <tt>Trusted Devices</tt>.</em></span>
</p><p>
Next, scroll down to the <tt  >Other ports</tt> text box, and add the entry
<tt  >https:tcp</tt>, which allows secure https connections.  You will need https
if you decide to configure Web mail, as described later in this article.
</p><p>
Activate the <tt  >OK</tt> button when you are finished with the customization
screen.  Also, activate <tt  >OK</tt> on the next screen.  Finally, restart <tt  >iptables</tt> to make sure that the changes take effect:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">[root@myvps ~]# /etc/init.d/iptables restart</pre><p>
You must be very careful when you reconfigure your iptables.  In addition
to the usual danger of creating new vulnerabilities, it is easy to lock
yourself out of the remote VPS server.  In that situation, you will have to ask your
VPS provider for help.  Other common ways to render the VPS inaccessible
are shutting down networking, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>SSH d&aelig;mon</em></span> (<tt  >sshd</tt>) or halting the
virtual machine.
</p><p>
Next, create an ordinary user login that you will use later to read and
send e-mail.  Set the password for the new account:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">[root@myvps ~]# useradd maila
[root@myvps ~]# passwd maila
Changing password for user maila.
New UNIX password:</pre><p>
Use names such as <tt  >maila</tt> or pseudonyms for logins.  This is more
secure and guards against inadvertent release of personal information
on-line.  Verify that you can log in to the new account.  You are now ready
to configure your mail server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf1580.0x1dea688"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Warning:</b></p><p>
There have
been many automated attacks against SSH.  <span   class="emphasis"><em>At the very least, you
must use strong passwords, or your system will be compromised.</em></span>
The <span   class="emphasis"><em>apg</em></span> utility simplifies this task.  It generates random, non-dictionary
&ldquo;words&rdquo; that you can pronounce.  There are apg packages for most popular
Linux distributions.
</p><p>
Make sure to look in the on-line Resources for this article for more
information.  SSH security is not specific to the VPS environment&mdash;it
is also an important issue in standard virtual hosting.  With a
VPS, however, you do have the flexibility to protect yourself
properly.  The resources page is at <a href="../152/9380.html" target="_self">/article/9380</a>.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf1580.0x1dea9f8"></a>
Configuring the Mail Server</h2></div></div><p>
The mail server, also known as the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mail Transfer
Agent</em></span> (MTA), is a program that delivers and receives e-mail
messages.  The MTA will receive all the mail that others send
you.  Likewise, any messages you send to others will leave your
VPS through the MTA.
</p><p>
The default MTA on your VPS is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Sendmail</em></span>.  This sophisticated, powerful
program has advantages for complex e-mail
configurations.  Unfortunately, it also is difficult to configure
and tends to have a lot of security problems.
</p><p>
Therefore, we replace Sendmail with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Postfix</em></span>.  Postfix is efficient,
very secure and, most important, easy to configure.  Before proceeding
with the installation, shut down Sendmail, and make sure that it will
not start again on reboot.  Then, install Postfix:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">[root@myvps ~]# /etc/init.d/sendmail stop
Shutting down sendmail:                      [  OK  ]
Shutting down sm-client:                     [  OK  ]
[root@myvps ~]# chkconfig --del sendmail
[root@myvps ~]# up2date --install postfix</pre><p>
Note that using the <tt  >up2date</tt> command to install packages is specific to Red
Hat and related distributions.  You may be presented with a configuration
screen the first time that you run <tt  >up2date</tt>.  You can simply press Enter
to accept the default values.  In addition, <tt  >up2date</tt> is sometimes very
slow and can even fail for transient reasons.  You can try the command
again if it does not work the first time.
</p><p>
The main Postfix configuration file is <tt  >/etc/postfix/main.cf</tt>.  Save
a copy of this file to read later, because it contains many helpful
comments.  Then, replace <tt  >/etc/postfix/main.cf</tt> with the code from Listing
1.  You should modify your new <tt  >main.cf</tt> to specify the domain names that
you will be hosting on your VPS.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf1580.0x1de1860"></a>Listing 1.  Example main.cf File for Postfix on a VPS</h2></div></div><pre     class="programlisting"># Example "main.cf" file for Postfix on a VPS.

Replace all occurrences of <tt  >first.domain</tt> in Listing 1 with your own
fully qualified domain name, such as <tt  >openlight.com</tt>.  <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
reverse DNS lookup of your VPS's IP address must return this
domain!</em></span> Otherwise, your outbound messages may be rejected
as spam.
</p><p>
If you are hosting an additional domain name, substitute it instead
of the <tt  >second.domain</tt> entry.  Otherwise, delete <tt  >second.domain</tt> before
using Listing 1.  If you wish, you can also, replace <tt  >maila</tt> in Listing 1 with the user name
of your choice.
</p><p>
Now, append an entry to the <tt  >/etc/aliases</tt> file to specify the user who
will receive root's mail.  Here is an example:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">root:           maila</pre><p>
Next, create accounts for the other e-mail users.  Append any aliases for
these users to <tt  >/etc/aliases</tt>.  The following example entry will cause user
<tt  >mailb</tt> to receive all messages sent to <tt  >promo@first.domain</tt>:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">promo:          mailb</pre><p>
Note that if you have an additional domain name, messages to
<tt  >promo@second.domain</tt> will also go to <tt  >mailb</tt>.  For a small organization,
this is probably the right default behavior, because all domain names
that you will be hosting are almost certainly related.  For example,
if you are hosting an additional domain for your product, then tech-support questions about the product should likely go to the same person,
regardless of which domain name appears in the e-mail address.
</p><p>
When you are finished, update the alias database file, and start Postfix:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">[root@myvps ~]# postalias /etc/aliases
[root@myvps ~]# /etc/init.d/postfix start
Starting postfix: [  OK  ]</pre><p>
Check the log file <tt  >/var/log/maillog</tt> for any errors.
</p><p>
You can update the aliases file even while Postfix is running, just run
<tt  >postalias /etc/aliases</tt> again when you are finished.
</p><p>
   You should now verify that Postfix is doing what you expect.  Connect to port 25 on your VPS using <span   class="emphasis"><em>telnet</em></span>, as shown in Listing 2.  Enter just the text highlighted in <span   class="bold"><b>bold</b></span>&mdash;the rest of the text is the system's responses.  Of course, you should type the IP address of your VPS in place of <tt  >MY.VPS.IP.ADDRESS</tt>, and your actual domain name instead of <tt  >first.domain</tt>.

Connection closed by foreign host.</pre><p>
Use Listing 2 as a guide to run the following tests:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Connect to port 25 of your VPS from an outside machine, such as
your workstation.  Verify that Postfix accepts messages for each
e-mail address you intend to use.  Then, make sure the
right users are receiving the messages.  See the following
discussion for details.
</p></li><li><p>
Connect again from the outside, and check that Postfix will
refuse to relay mail to other systems.  Use an e-mail account that
you have on some other system as the destination, just in case.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>It is very important that your MTA refuse any relay
requests from external machines.</em></span> Otherwise, spammers
will quickly discover that they can route their junk e-mails
through your system.
</p></li><li><p>
Using <tt  >telnet</tt> from a shell prompt on your VPS itself, check that
the MTA will relay mail to remote servers.  Use your own e-mail
account on some other system as the destination.  Note that the
remote MTA may refuse to accept the message, because your system
is not live yet, so reverse DNS lookups will not yield the right
result.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
You can verify that a user on the VPS has received mail with the <span   class="emphasis"><em>mail</em></span>
command.  Here is an example that checks the mail for maila:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">[root@myvps ~]# mail -u maila</pre><p>
The <tt  >mail</tt> command is a simple mail reader.  Type <tt  >h</tt> to view the received
messages, then type the number of the message to view it.  Press the
spacebar to scroll through the message.  You also can scroll through
the message with the Enter key, but it will start viewing the next
message after it gets to the end of the current one.  You can type
<tt  >q</tt>
to stop viewing a message.  When you are not viewing a message, typing
<tt  >q</tt> will exit mail.  The <tt  >?</tt> key brings up a help screen.
</p><p>
When everything is working as it should, tell your initialization scripts
to launch Postfix automatically on system reboot:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">[root@myvps ~]# chkconfig --add postfix</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf1580.0x1de2eb8"></a>
Preparing to Read Your Mail</h2></div></div><p>
In this article, we discuss two methods for reading your mail.  One
is to download the mail to your workstation.  The other is to leave it
on the VPS and use a Web-based solution to view the messages through
your browser.  You can use both methods together.
</p><p>
The first approach requires the <span   class="emphasis"><em>POP3</em></span> protocol, and the second needs
<span   class="emphasis"><em>IMAP</em></span>.  On Fedora, the simplest way to get both is to install
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dovecot</em></span>:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">[root@myvps ~]# up2date --install dovecot</pre><p>
When the installation finishes, edit <tt  >/etc/dovecot.conf</tt>.  Find the
<tt  >protocols</tt> directive and replace it with the following.  Do not delete
the original line, but comment it out for future reference:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">#protocols = imap imaps pop3 pop3s
protocols = pop3 imap</pre><p>
As a security precaution, configure both POP3 and IMAP to accept requests
only from the VPS itself.  Once again, do not delete the original code,
but leave it commented out for future reference:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">#imap_listen = [::]
imap_listen = [127.0.0.1]
#pop3_listen = [::]
pop3_listen = [127.0.0.1]</pre><p>
Start <tt  >dovecot</tt>, and add it to your system's initialization scripts:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">[root@myvps ~]# /etc/init.d/dovecot start
Starting Dovecot Imap:                       [  OK  ]
[root@myvps ~]# chkconfig --level 345 dovecot on</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf1580.0x1de3490"></a>
How to Read and Send Mail from Your Workstation</h2></div></div><p>
We will be using <span   class="emphasis"><em>SSH tunneling</em></span> to read and send mail securely from your
workstation.  With SSH tunneling, you can temporarily map ports on the VPS
to available ports on the workstation.  All communication on the mapped
ports takes place over an encrypted tunnel.
</p><p>
Give the following command on your workstation.  Use your VPS's IP address
if you did not add an entry for <tt  >myvps</tt> in the <tt  >/etc/hosts</tt> file on your
workstation:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">[usera@ws ~]$ ssh -Nf maila@myvps \
-L 2525:localhost:25 -L 2110:localhost:110</pre><p>
The user <tt  >maila</tt> must have shell access to the VPS.  You will be prompted
for <tt  >maila</tt>'s password.
</p><p>
This tunnel maps ports 25 and 110 on the VPS to ports 2525 and 2110
on the workstation, respectively.  If you are already downloading your
inbound mail using POP3 and sending your outbound mail through an ISP's
mail server, you will require very few changes to your mail client's
configuration.
</p><p>
Simply set your POP3 server as <tt  >localhost</tt> with port 2110, and your
outbound mail server to <tt  >localhost</tt> with port 2525.  You even can leave
your outbound mail settings unchanged, unless you plan to cancel the
account at the ISP whose mail server you are currently using.  Here are
specific instructions for two popular e-mail clients.
</p><p>
If you use <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mozilla Thunderbird</em></span>, select <tt  >Account Settings...</tt>  from the
<tt  >Edit</tt> menu.  Add a new account by clicking the <tt  >Add Account...</tt>  button
in the dialog box, and follow the prompts in the <tt  >Account Wizard</tt>.  After
you create the new account, click on its <tt  >Server Settings</tt> list item
in the left pane to configure the POP3 server and port.  Figure 1 shows
the screenshot.  Red-colored highlights indicate the most important parameters.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8337f1.large.jpg"><img src="8337f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Setting Up Your Mail Account in Mozilla Thunderbird
</p></div></div><p>
You also can configure Thunderbird's outgoing mail server from the same
<tt  >Account Settings</tt> dialog box.  Click on <tt  >Outgoing Server (SMTP)</tt> in the
left pane of the dialog.  Figure 2 shows the resulting screenshot.  Remember
to uncheck the <tt  >Use name and password</tt> check box.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8337f2.large.jpg"><img src="8337f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Set up your outgoing mail server to localhost at port 2525.
</p></div></div><p>
Another popular mail client is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mutt</em></span>.  A typical Mutt-based configuration
uses <span   class="emphasis"><em>Fetchmail</em></span> to download the mail, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Procmail</em></span> to sort it into mailboxes
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>ssmtp</em></span> to deliver the outbound mail.  See Listing 3 for an example
<tt  >.fetchmailrc</tt> file and Listing 4 for an example <tt  >ssmtp.conf</tt> file.  Both use the
SSH tunnel that we created earlier.  Do not forget to change the code in
Listing 3 to reflect your correct user names and passwords.

Finally, note that you need to set up the SSH tunnel again every
time you reboot your workstation.  There are many ways to automate the
process, but it is beyond the scope of this article to discuss them.

How to Read and Send Mail over the Web</h2></div></div><p>
The Fedora Linux distribution provides a Web-based e-mail
interface that requires very little work to configure.  It is based
on <span   class="emphasis"><em>SquirrelMail</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Apache</em></span>.  Web mail is an easy way to support Windows
clients.  It also does not require shell access on the VPS.
</p><p>
First, install SquirrelMail:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">[root@myvps ~]# up2date --install squirrelmail</pre><p>
This process also installs several other packages that SquirrelMail
requires.  Next, enable secure https access by installing <span   class="emphasis"><em>mod_ssl</em></span>:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">[root@myvps ~]# up2date --install mod_ssl</pre><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>You must disable unsecure http access
to SquirrelMail.</em></span> Edit the file
<tt  >/etc/httpd/conf.d/squirrelmail.conf</tt>, and append the following lines:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;LocationMatch "/webmail"&gt;
SSLRequireSSL
&lt;/LocationMatch&gt;</pre><p>
Now, start the Apache Web server:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">[root@myvps ~]# /etc/init.d/httpd start</pre><p>
Connect to <tt  >https://MY.VPS.IP.ADDRESS/webmail</tt>.  Your browser will warn
you about the SSL certificate&mdash;just accept it permanently, and you
will not be warned again.  The only way to avoid this error altogether
is to use a certificate signed by a recognized <span   class="emphasis"><em>Certificate Authority</em></span>
(CA).  The CA will need to verify your identity and also will charge an
annual fee for signing the certificate.
</p><p>
After accepting the certificate, you should be able to log in as any of
the mail users that you have created earlier.  If a particular mail
user&mdash;for example <tt  >mailb</tt>&mdash;does not need shell access, disable it with the
following command:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">[root@myvps ~]# usermod -s /sbin/nologin mailb</pre><p>
Do not forget to add the Apache Web server to your startup environment:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">[root@myvps ~]# chkconfig --level 345 httpd on</pre><p>
Your Web mail users should click on the <tt  >Options</tt> link in the SquirrelMail
interface and configure their account information.  Otherwise,
SquirrelMail will format their messages with something like
<tt  >mailb@localhost.localdomain</tt> in the <tt  >From</tt> field.  This certainly
will confuse anyone who receives such a message.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This article has covered one of the most difficult aspects of
switching to a VPS account&mdash;setting up your e-mail.  As you have
seen, e-mail service is provided by a collection of several different
programs working together.  There are many other ways to configure this
service.  Unfortunately, it would require a lengthy book to describe and
compare them all.  This article tries to provide a simple solution with
good security that a new VPS user can implement quickly.
</p><p>
Welcome to the world of VPS hosting&mdash;the server that is (almost)
your own.
