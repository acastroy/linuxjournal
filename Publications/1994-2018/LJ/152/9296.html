Here in the Paranoid Penguin column, we're in the midst of building a
virtual network server using User-Mode Linux.  Last month, I explained
why this is a good idea, how it works, how to prepare your host for
optimized User-Mode Linux operation and how to build a kernel for your
guest (virtual) system(s).
</p><p>
This month, we turn our attention to the guest system: how to obtain a
prebuilt root filesystem image, how to configure networking on both your
host and guest systems, and how to begin customizing the root filesystem
image for your own purposes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc4e580.0xd46558"></a>
Quick Review</h2></div></div><p>
First, here's a quick review of what we're trying to do, in case you missed
last month's column.  Our objective is to use User-Mode Linux to create
one or more virtual guest machines, each running a different network
service.  That way, if one application (for example, BIND) on one guest
machine gets compromised somehow, Sendmail, Apache and whatever else
you've got running on other guest systems (or on the underlying host
system itself) won't be affected.
</p><p>
(Per User-Mode Linux convention, we're using the word host to denote
a system on top of which virtual machines run and the word guest to denote
a virtual system instance.)
</p><p>
Debian is our somewhat arbitrary choice here for both host and
guest systems, due to the ease with which you can create bare-bones
Debian installations, though User-Mode Linux itself is decidedly
distribution-agnostic.  We'll create a single guest system, running
BIND software for DNS services.
</p><p>
On the strength of last month's procedures, hopefully you've got a
skas-enabled host kernel and a guest kernel compiled for the um
architecture.  Now, it's time to acquire or build a root filesystem image.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc4e580.0xd46768"></a>
Just What Is a Root Filesystem Image, and How Will It Be Used?</h2></div></div><p>
When your Linux host starts up, it learns where / is via the
root command-line switch; somewhere in lilo.conf or menu.lst is a
kernel-invocation line containing something like
<tt  >root=/dev/hda1</tt>.  That's
how it works with User-Mode Linux too, except that rather than a physical
hard disk, such as /dev/hda, we generally use a virtual disk in the form of
a single flat file, called a root filesystem image.
</p><p>
The root filesystem image contains a complete Linux distribution.  You've
already created similar image files yourself if you've ever copied a
CD-ROM to an ISO file (or vice versa).  Using a filesystem that takes the
form of a single file has two important ramifications for User-Mode Linux:
first, it helps keep your guest system relatively compact and portable;
second, it makes change control as simple as tracking changes to a single
file, via the COW file method.
</p><p>
Suppose I start a User-Mode Linux guest with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   umluser@host:~&gt; ./guestkernel ubd0=mycow,my_root_fs root=/dev/ubda
</pre>
</p><p>
Note the umluser@host prompt.  I'm executing this command from a
shell session to which I'm logged in as a regular user,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
root.  guestkernel is my executable User-Mode Linux guest kernel;
ubd0 is a virtual disk device I'm declaring to consist of the image
file my_root_fs plus a change-on-write (COW) file called mycow.
The root switch defines our root partition to be the virtual disk ubda
(identified by its full path, /dev/ubda).
</p><p>
Somewhat confusingly, by convention, virtual disk declarations
use numbered device names (ubd0, ubd1 and so on), but root filesystem
definitions use the corresponding letters instead (ubda, ubdb and so on),
which are synonymous.  The command <tt  >./guestkernel ubda=mycow,my_root_fs
root=/dev/ubda</tt> actually works just as well on my SUSE system as the
above command, but your distribution of choice may behave differently.
</p><p>
Strictly speaking, the COW file is optional.  If you specify one,
changes you make to the image file during your User-Mode Linux session
will be written to the COW file rather than to the disk image itself.  If
you omit the COW filename, the image file will be written to
directly by the guest kernel&mdash;that is, any changes you make to your
guest system will be &ldquo;permanent&rdquo;.
</p><p>
As far as I'm concerned, when using UML in security scenarios, COW files
are mandatory.  A key assumption in using User-Mode Linux for hosting
a network service is that this service may be compromised in some way,
and if it is, you'll want to be able to recover as quickly as possible.  If
you use a COW file, all you'll need to do to restore a guest system to its
baseline state is delete the old COW file and create a new (empty) one.
</p><p>
Another key advantage of using COW files is that they allow you to use the
same root filesystem image on more than one guest system
simultaneously.
All you need to do is specify a different COW file each time you bring
up a guest kernel.  In fact, you can use both the same image file and
the same kernel for multiple guests.  As you can guess, we're going to
use a COW file in our example scenarios.

Getting a Root Filesystem Image</h2></div></div><p>
The procedure for building your own root filesystem image boils down
to this:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Create an empty filesystem image file and mount it to some directory.
</p></li><li><p>
Install Linux into that directory.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Sounds simple, right? On Debian and SUSE it is&mdash;sort of.  On other
distributions, it's much less so.  Regardless, I'm going to save a
more-detailed discussion of that process for my next column, in which
I'll cover what I consider to be advanced User-Mode Linux topics and
techniques.  In the interests of getting you up and running with User-Mode
Linux in a gratifyingly quick manner, for now I recommend you download
a prebuilt image.
</p><p>
My favorite source of these is Nagafix Ltd.'s &ldquo;UML
Resources&rdquo; page (see the on-line Resources) from whence you can download root filesystem
images for not only Debian guests, but also Gentoo, Slackware, Fedora,
Ubuntu and others.  Nagafix makes a reasonable effort to keep these
images up to date with security patches, which is a nice touch.
</p><p>
In addition, Nagafix provides an MD5 and SHA hash of each image file
it provides.  You may miss them if you click directly on the x86 and
AMD64 links on the page cited above; instead, use the OS-name links,
each of which leads to a page containing links not only to images but
also to build logs and hashes, plus handy tips on how to update the
images yourself.
</p><p>
I obtained my Debian 3.1 image by navigating to <a href="http://uml.nagafix.co.uk" target="_self">uml.nagafix.co.uk</a>,
clicking on Debian 3.1, and then clicking on the root_fs and
MD5 links to download the files Debian-3.1-x86-root_fs.bz2 and
Debian-3.1-x86-root_fs.bz2.md5, respectively.  After my downloads were
complete (the filesystem image itself is 169MB!), I verified the MD5
signature from within a terminal window with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   md5sum -c ./Debian-3.1-x86-root_fs.bz2.md5
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc4e580.0xd471b8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
When in Doubt, Roll Your Own Image</b></p><p>
Even if you use a root filesystem image from a trusted source and verify
its integrity via an MD5, SHA or GPG hash/signature, the fact is,
if you're truly worried about security (we are, aren't we?), you're much
better off building your own filesystem image than using someone else's.
</p><p>
I'm indulging in just a little laziness and instant gratification by
using a prebuilt image in this article, which I think is justifiable in
the larger aim of encouraging UML experimentation and adoption.  Just
be sure to check your image's hash/signature, and the first time you
mount it in UML, run <tt  >apt-get dist-upgrade</tt> (or YaST Online Update, yum
or whatever update mechanism your guest's distro supports).
</p><p>
Next time, I'll discuss the filesystem image build process in more depth,
as well as how to use iptables both on your host and on your guest OSes
to add another layer of protection to your virtual machines.
</p></div><p>
And, now we're ready to boot our virtual guest for the first
time.  We've got a guest kernel named uml-guestkernel-2.6.17.3
(from my previous column's example) and a root filesystem image named
Debian-3.1-x86-root_fs.bz2.  You should already be logged in to a terminal
session as a nonroot user.  Uncompress the filesystem image with the
command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   bunzip2 ./Debian-3.1-x86-root_fs.bz2
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, just as a sanity
check, try booting your guest system:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   umluser@host:~&gt; ./uml-guestkernel-2.6.17.3
   &#8618;ubd0=testcow,Debian-3.1-x86-root_fs root=/dev/ubda
</pre>
</p><p>
If all is well, you should see some User-Mode Linux messages, followed
by a longer string of Linux kernel startup messages, ending with a login
prompt.  Log in as root&mdash;you won't be prompted for a password.  Feel free
to poke around a bit; you won't hurt anything that can't be fixed later
by starting with a fresh COW file.
</p><p>
To see a list of installed packages, enter the command <tt  >dpkg -l
|less</tt>.
You may be surprised by how few Debian packages are present.  Don't
worry; you'll be able to install additional packets with apt-get, just
like on a &ldquo;real&rdquo; Debian system.  When you're done with your initial
exploration, issue the command <tt  >halt</tt> to shut down your guest system
cleanly.  We've got some things to do before your guest system can do
any serious work&mdash;first and foremost is configuring networking.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc4e580.0xd47790"></a>
Using Bridged Networking with User-Mode Linux</h2></div></div><p>
There are a variety of ways to network UML guests, all of
which are described in Rusty Russell's User-Mode Linux HOWTO (see
Resources).  The
best option for using UML guests as network servers is bridging, in
which your host system acts like an Ethernet bridge between itself,
the UML guests running on it and the outside world.
</p><p>
In a nutshell, the procedure is this:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Configure your host's TCP/IP stack as a virtual bridge, and then define
your &ldquo;real&rdquo; network interface as the first
&ldquo;port&rdquo; on that bridge.
</p></li><li><p>
For each guest system you intend to run, create a local tunnel interface
and define it as another port on the bridge.
</p></li><li><p>
When you start a guest system, define its virtual Ethernet interface
(eth0) to be the tunnel interface you created in the previous step.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Listing 1 shows the precise series of commands this translates to, adapted
from David Cannings' useful article &ldquo;Networking UML Using
Bridging&rdquo;.  All
these commands must be executed as root.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc4e580.0xd47cb8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. Setting Up Bridged Networking</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
   root@host# bash -c 'echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward'
   root@host# apt-get install bridge-utils uml-utilities
   root@host# ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0 promisc up
   root@host# brctl addbr uml-bridge
   root@host# brctl setfd uml-bridge 0
   root@host# brctl sethello uml-bridge 0
   root@host# brctl stp uml-bridge off
   root@host# ifconfig uml-bridge 192.168.250.250 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
   root@host# brctl addif uml-bridge eth0
   root@host# tunctl -u umluser -t uml-conn0
   root@host# chgrp uml-net /dev/net/tun
   root@host# chmod 660 /dev/net/tun
   root@host# ifconfig uml-conn0 0.0.0.0 promisc up
   root@host# brctl addif uml-bridge uml-conn0
</pre></div><p>
The first command enables IP forwarding on your host.  Although,
technically,
bridging happens at a lower level than IP forwarding, they amount to
the same thing from the kernel's perspective.  Accordingly, if you have
a local iptables policy on your host, you'll need to add rules to the
FORWARD table to enable traffic to and from the tunnel interfaces you
attach to the host's bridge.
</p><p>
The second command (apt-get install...), obviously, installs the Debian
packages bridge-utils and uml-utilities.  bridge-utilities provides
the brctl command, and uml-utilities provides the tunctl command.  For
these commands to work, your host kernel needs to have been compiled with
802.1d Ethernet bridging, IP tunneling, Bridged IP/ARP packet filtering
and Universal TUN/TAP device driver support.
</p><p>
The third command in Listing 1 (ifconfig eth0...) may seem a bit
scary.  It resets your host's Ethernet interface to a (temporarily)
IP-free state.  Be prepared for an interruption in local network
functionality after you execute this command.
</p><p>
The subsequent six commands, however, will restore it by defining a new
virtual bridge device (called uml-bridge), configuring it, assigning
your host's IP address to it (192.168.250.250 in this example), and
attaching eth0 to it as a virtual bridge port.  If the IP address of eth0
on your host was 10.1.1.10 before you reset it to 0.0.0.0, after
issuing the first four brctl commands you would use <tt  >ifconfig uml-bridge
10.1.1.10 netmask 255.255.255.0 up</tt>.  At this point, your host should be
able to interact with the outside world in exactly the same way as it
did before (unless of course your local iptables policy doesn't have
appropriate FORWARD rules yet).
</p><p>
All right, our host system is now a bridge.  All that remains is to attach
a tunnel port to it.  You should repeat the remaining steps in Listing 1
(starting with tunctl -u...) for each guest system you intend to run.
</p><p>
In the tunctl -u... command,
umluser is the name of the unprivileged
account you intend to use when executing guest kernels, and uml-conn0
is the name of the new tunnel interface you're creating.
</p><p>
In the subsequent chgrp and chmod commands, we're changing the
permissions of the virtual tunnel device, always /dev/net/tun, to be
readable and writable by our unprivileged account.  In this example,
therefore, the account umluser belongs to the group uml-net.  (On my
real-life test system, I instead used the the group wheel, which my
unprivileged account mick belongs to.)
</p><p>
After setting the new tunnel interface's IP address to 0.0.0.0 (just like
we did with eth0), we define it as another port on the local bridge with
that last brctl command.
</p><p>
That's it! Now when we start the guest system, we add the option
<tt  >eth0=tuntap,uml-conn0</tt> to our kernel command line, which tells the
kernel to use the tunnel interface uml-conn0 as its virtual eth0.  Our
complete example command line, which unlike Listing 1, should be run by
a nonprivileged user rather than root, looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   umluser@host$ ./debkern ubd0=debcow,debroot root=/dev/ubda
   &#8618;eth0=tuntap,uml-conn0
</pre>
</p><p>
After the virtual machine starts, you can assign an IP address
to (virtual) eth0 via <tt  >ifconfig</tt>, define a default route via <tt  >route
add...</tt> (using the same gateway IP that your host system uses), set DNS
lookup information in /etc/resolv.conf, and, in short, configure it in
precisely the same way that you'd configure a real Debian system.
</p><p>
Once your virtual machine is successfully communicating with your local
LAN and beyond, you should immediately configure apt-get and use it to
install the latest Debian patches on your virtual guest.  You'll need
apt-get working anyhow to install the network software you've just gone
to all the trouble of building this virtual machine to run.  In the case
of our example virtual DNS server, these would probably be the Debian
packages bind9 and maybe also bind9-doc.  Remember, all of these
changes will be made to your COW file, so be sure to specify the same
COW file on subsequent startups (or merge it into your image via the
uml_moo command).
</p><p>
Next time, we'll wrap up this series by discussing additional security
controls you can use on your guest systems, a nifty COW file trick or two
and, of course, how to create a custom root filesystem image.  Until then,
be safe!
