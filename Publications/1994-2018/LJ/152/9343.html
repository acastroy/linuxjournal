The December 2006 Cooking with Linux marks seven years of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, its Linux Chef and Fran&ccedil;ois, his famous waiter.  For this
occasion, Marcel has invited some regular readers of the column to share
their favorite issues and, of course, a glass or two (or three, or four)
of wine.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe98580.0xf903f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Seven years, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>.  Yes, Fran&ccedil;ois, it does seem to have gone by
very quickly.  We'll have plenty of time to reminisce when our guests
arrive.  Ah, but they are already here! Welcome, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span> to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, where you'll find one of the world's largest wine
cellars and the finest in Linux and open-source software.  Please sit and
make yourselves comfortable.  I'll have Fran&ccedil;ois fetch the wine right away.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi? Incroyable!</em></span> It appears that my faithful waiter decided to
beat me to the punch when it came to tonight's wine selection.  He has
already chosen the wine and brought it up from the cellar.  Since this is a
penguin-studded magazine, he has chosen one of my favorite, not to mention
inexpensive, Australian wines.  It's called Little Penguin.  Of
course, my judgment may be clouded by the name of the winery, but the
choice seems fitting.  Fran&ccedil;ois, please serve the Little Penguin
wine for our guests.  Today, we have both a Chardonnay and a Shiraz (for
those who prefer red).
</p><p>
Those of you who have been following this column from the beginning
may already be aware that this December 2006 issue marks seven years
of my Cooking with Linux.  The first of these columns, however, was a
kind of experiment, featured in the September 1999 special issue.  The
regular series began a few months later, with the January 2000 issue.  To
commemorate, the folks at <i  >Linux Journal</i> suggested I select a few of
my favorite columns for this issue.  When I thought about this idea, I
decided that the best arbiters were the readers, and so I've invited a
number of special guests here tonight to tell us what they liked, and why.
</p><p>
Let's start with table seven, where Troy Banther is waving his hand
madly.  &ldquo;One of my favorites is 'If Only You Could Restore
Wine' in
the June 2006 issue of the magazine.  Knowing what programs are out there
in the Linux world and having a how-to on backing up and restoring is
great.  I'm extremely partial to KDar since I use the KDE window
manager.&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9343f1.large.jpg"><img src="9343f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. KDar, because backups should be easy, even if they are essential.
</p></div></div><p>
Jon Biddell, at table 15, agrees with Troy Banther.  &ldquo;I think my favorite
would have been the June 2006 article on backups&mdash;something I don't do
anywhere near as often as I need to....&rdquo;
</p><p>
Over at table three, Colleen Beamer says she doesn't know if she can
pick just one.  She tends to lean toward the August 2004 issue because
&ldquo;this column introduced me to Krecipes [Figure 2], and I went
from there to have my first true open-source involvement by writing
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Krecipes Handbook</em></span>.  'Crossing Platforms', in the May 2005 issue,
introduced me to my <span   class="emphasis"><em>still</em></span> favourite Linux game,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Blobwars</em></span>.  However, if I
have to pick one column, the one in the September 2005 issue, 'Wireless
Tools',
has helped me the most.  Without it, I probably wouldn't have been able
to know what to do to get wireless installed and working on my
laptop.&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9343f2.large.jpg"><img src="9343f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Krecipes as it appeared in August 2004.  The package will likely
reach its 1.0 release when this issue is released.
</p></div></div><p>
When Daniel Gagnon, who is sipping his wine at table 27,
was asked about his favorite, he replied, &ldquo;The one about Tellico
[Figure 3], in the April 2005 column titled, 'The Cook's
Collection'.  Why? Simply because people are always borrowing my
books.&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9343f3.large.jpg"><img src="9343f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Tellico makes a great personal library system, and it looks
good doing it.
</p></div></div><p>
   He adds, &ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>En passant, un article sur le caract&egrave;re multilingue de Linux
pourrais &ecirc;tre int	&eacute;ressant, n'est-ce pas?</em></span>&rdquo;
</p><p>
All right, Daniel, I'll just take care of that request right now.  In KDE,
fire up the KDE Control Center (command name,
<tt  >kcontrol</tt>) and
click on Regional &amp; Accessibility.  Under that category, select Keyboard
Layouts.  Usually, the only layout visible to the right in the main window
(under Active Layouts) is whatever you chose during installation.  On
mine, it says, &ldquo;U.S.  English&rdquo;.  Now, I like having access to a quick
keyboard switch so that I can use things like the &eacute; at the end of
my last name.  These are included in the Canadian layout.  I also can get
them using the &ldquo;U.S.  English w/deadkeys&rdquo; layout.  So, I select it from the
Available Layouts section, then click the Add button (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9343f4.large.jpg"><img src="9343f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. You don't have to be limited to a single keyboard layout.
</p></div></div><p>
If you want more, add them now as well.  Then, click Apply.  A small flag
icon appears in the system tray of your kicker panel, over on the
right.  Click the icon to switch from one layout to the other.  If you are
using OpenOffice.org, you now can type the characters you want without doing
an &ldquo;Insert Special Character&rdquo; operation each time.  If you find yourself
having problems with those characters displaying properly in
OpenOffice.org,
this is usually a problem due to using incorrect or incompatible fonts.  For
example, someone sends you a document with a Microsoft font and you don't
have it installed.  The resulting text, particularly if you are entering
special characters, can then look a bit strange.  All that's needed is
to add those fonts using the spadmin program (OpenOffice.org's
printer administration program, which also lets you add fonts).  I hope
that helps you out, Daniel.
</p><p>
Fran&ccedil;ois, our guests' glasses are looking a little low.  If you would
be so kind as to visit everyone and indulge each guest with his or her choice of
wine.  While you do so, we'll check in with John Kerr, over at table
12.  He says, &ldquo;I must admit that finding a favorite column would be
difficult as there are so many good ones to choose from.  My favorite
column, however, is the August 2005, 'Ultimate in Small
Linux'
article.  This column demonstrates two mini-distros (Damn Small Linux
and Puppy Linux) as well as the unique ways they can be used&mdash;live
CD, disk install or USB key [Figure 5].  These distros also
can be used to revive older equipment.  This only emphasizes the diversity
of our favorite operating system.&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9343f5.large.jpg"><img src="9343f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
Choosing a favorite was also a bit difficult for David Knickmeyer,
sitting over at table 19.  He says, &ldquo;I'd probably go with the Xnest
article [Figure 6], 'Can't Get Enough Desktops', in the March
2004 issue.  I admit it, I'm an eye-candy junkie.  GNOME, Enlightenment,
Window Maker&mdash;I've tried them all, often.  I keep coming back to KDE and
SuperKaramba, but the nested X servers let me play around and still be
productive&mdash;well....&rdquo;

</p></div></div><p>
I see another hand waving over at table eight, and it's Lew Pitcher.
&ldquo;My
list runs around 20 articles so far, and I've covered only about half of
my <i  >LJ</i> back issues.  So, you can imagine the difficulty I have in picking
<span   class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> column.  But, pick one I have.  I take you back to February 2002,
to a column entitled 'Observe, Mon Cher Ami', in which you introduced
us to xawtv and video conferencing in general.  In that column, Fran&ccedil;ois
finally got a face (even though it was a stuffed toy avatar), and he met
a mystery woman, who shall go nameless, but might be known as Sally
in other places [Figure 7].  Of course, my second-favorite column
would be from December 2004, 'Lights...Camera...Action!',
in which we find the tools to do video podcasts among the various bits
and pieces of our toolboxes.  Who knew that a cheap microphone and a
just-as-cheap Webcam could make you a video star?&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9343f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
Over at table 32, Johann Schmidt has this to say, &ldquo;My nomination
for favorite Cooking with Linux column is fairly recent&mdash;from
the December 2005 issue, 'amaroKing the Night Away'.  I had not
heard of Amarok before [Figure 8], and your introduction to it was
fantastic.  I installed it at home the day I received the issue at work,
and after only a slight bit of dependence-finding, I had an awesome music
system/library/jukebox.  It works with our iPods too! I have been
getting my children more and more exposed to Linux&mdash;and because
Amarok
doesn't crash like iTunes does on that proprietary x86 OS, they have
yet another reason to be open-source kids.&rdquo;

getting better all the time.
</p></div></div><p>
Bert Sutherland has this to say, &ldquo;My favorite choice by far is your
November 2004 'Illuminating Your Network's Darkest Corners'.  I had
been a <i  >Linux Journal</i> subscriber for only a few months when this
issue came out, and it is still one of the best articles I've read.  When
I sit down to read Cooking with Linux, I know I am in for a surprise and
that
you will be serving up another selection (of wine
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> Linux tidbits of
information) that I was previously not aware existed.  This was the case with
the programs mentioned in your network article, and to this day IPTraf
[Figure 9] is one of the first programs I install when working with
a new machine.&rdquo;

</p></div></div><p>
Margaret Wendall, sitting over at table 14, also is interested in
security: &ldquo;It's become apparent to me and one of my clients (I help with
his Web pages) that people are stealing <span   class="emphasis"><em>my</em></span> photos and using them to
advertise on their pages.  I think your good instructions on steganography,
back in the January 2005 article 'Forgotten Security', are going
to be a better solution than something like Digimark, because only
two or three people will even know the photos are encrypted.  This is
not only fun, but very practical.&rdquo; <span   class="emphasis"><em>Was I a spy in a past
life?</em></span>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9343f10.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div><p>
Fran&ccedil;ois, how did you manage to sneak in that portrait of yourself? You
truly are efficient today, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>.  I see that you have continued
to refresh our guests' glasses.  Excellent.  Sadly, it seems that closing
time is upon us, so the next refill will have to be the last one.  My
sincere thanks to everyone out there for joining me here every month
these past seven years and for helping make Cooking with Linux
as much fun as it has been.  I also want to thank the members of my
own WFTL-LUG, aka &ldquo;The Lug Nuts&rdquo; (new members welcome), who joined
me in the restaurant today.  For a complete list of past Cooking
