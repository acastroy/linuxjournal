    When you
    go shopping you just have to say Linux every time you see Unix.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27a9580.0x28a1298"></a></h2></div></div><p>As we zero in on the second &ldquo;production&rdquo;
release of the Linux kernel, 1.2, the most common complaint I hear
about Linux is its lack of documentation. But, is that really a
problem? I think not. Here's why.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27a9580.0x28a13a0"></a>Linux Is Very Unix-like</h2></div></div><p>What this means is that if you are looking for a book on
basic Linux commands or how to use the VI editor you have a lot of
choices. When you go shopping you just have to say Linux every time
you see Unix. Sure, there are some differences, but not many from
the user's point of view. As all &ldquo;Unix-like&rdquo; systems converge on
the various standards, such as POSIX and Spec 1170, the differences
disappear. Today there are more differences between a BSD-based
version of Unix and a System V-based version of Unix than there are
between either of these and Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27a9580.0x28a14a8"></a>Linux Is Documented by the LDP</h2></div></div><p>There is real Linux-specific documentation. The Linux
Documentation Project (LDP), headed by Matt Welsh, is producing
high-quality documentation. Right now, Matt's own <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Installation and Getting Started</em></span> is either included with
most CD-ROM distributions or available from the distributor or
reseller.</p><p>Olaf Kirch's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Network Administrator's
Guide</em></span> has been published by SSC and an O'Reilly version
is also on the way. The excellent coverage of networking in general
will probably make this book the first Linux-specific book to
become commonly used by non-Linux (read that as Unix) users as
well.</p><p>Michael K. Johnson, our editor, is now in the process of
updating his <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Kernel Hacker's Guide
(KHG)</em></span>. You will see some of this information in his new
monthly <span   class="emphasis"><em>Kernel Korner</em></span> column. And, once it is
up to date, SSC plans to publish it.</p><p>There are more LDP books on the way. Expect to see a System
Administrator's Guide, Programmer's Guide, User's Guide and man
pages. And, of course, all of these books are available on the
archive CD-ROMs and ftp sites.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27a9580.0x28a1818"></a>New Linux Documentation Appears Every Month</h2></div></div><p>Besides the LDP efforts, publishers are getting on the Linux
bandwagon. Springer-Verlag has published a book titled Linux:
Unleashing the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Workstation in Your PC</em></span>,
available in both German and English. O'Reilly is working on a
Linux book, and rumors indicate that Benjamin-Cummings and SAMS are
working on Linux books. 1995 will probably be the year of Linux
documentation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27a9580.0x28a1978"></a>Why All the Complaints?</h2></div></div><p>Many people who are complaining just downloaded Linux off an
ftp site or bought an archive CD. In either case, there is lots of
documentation available but it doesn't print itself. You need to
remember that if you bought SCO Unix you probably dug into your
pocket for $1,000 or more as opposed to less than $100 for Linux.
Either take some money and buy the books you need or take some time
and print out what is on the CD.</p><p>The other problem, of course, is getting you to read the
documentation. Many CD vendors are now including a small book with
the distribution to get you started. People seem less intimidated
by a 20-page insert in the CD case than by a 1,000-page manual.
Just remember, you may still need that 1,000 pages of documentation
to find all the answers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27a9580.0x28a1ad8"></a>Is There Still a Problem?</h2></div></div><p>Yes, there is. Linux is changing so rapidly that it is hard
for the documentation to keep up. For example, if you buy a printed
copy of the Linux HOWTOs that has been sitting on a bookstore shelf
for a few months, most of it is already out of date. Documentation
that will be outdated by the time it is printed is not what
publishers (or booksellers) like.</p><p>But this is one of the reasons the LDP separated the HOWTOs
from the LDP books. These books evolved with much feedback from the
early users and, as each one becomes stable, they are becoming
available in printed form.</p><p>Many of the distributors include HOWTOs on their distribution
CDs along with browser tools to search, read and print them. The
initial focus has been browsers under MS-Windows. (As much as I
dislike this dependence on Microsoft, some people are going to need
to be able to read the documentation in order to get Linux up and
running.)</p><p>Matt Welsh, coordinator of the LDP, has recently made the
HOWTOs available on sunsite.unc.edu in HTML format (as well as
other formats). This means that if you have the HTML format
documents in an uncompressed form on your system (some archive CDs
have this) you can use a WWW browser such as Lynx or Mosaic to
access these documents in hypertext form. And, as the lead time on
pressing and distributing a CD is shorter than that for a printed
book, the consumer can get the best of both worlds&mdash;stable
documentation for their bookshelf and up-to-the-minute
documentation on the CD.</p><p>In conclusion, the Linux community and the publishing
community have heard you and are taking action. There is
documentation and there will be more. But remember your obligation:
support these publishing efforts including the LDP, get the
documentation and, last but not least, RTFM.</p></div></div>
