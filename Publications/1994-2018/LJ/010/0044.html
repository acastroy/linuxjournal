    In the December issue, we introduced X Window System
    programming with Tcl and Tk, showing you how to write wish
    scripts for simple X-based applications. This month, we'll
    show you how to use Tcl and Tk from your C programs.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2067580.0x215f450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Tcl was originally designed to be an
&ldquo;extension language&rdquo;--that is, an interpreted script language to be
embedded in another program (say, one written in C) and used to
either handle the mundane tasks of user customizations, or, with
Tk, more complex tasks such as providing an X Window System
interface for the program. The Tcl interpreter itself is simply a
library of functions which you can invoke from your program; Tk is
a series of routines used in conjunction with the Tcl interpreter.
Although you can write Tcl/Tk programs entirely as scripts, to be
executed via <b  >wish</b>, this is only one side of the
story. To really make this system shine you need to utilize Tcl and
Tk from other programs.
</p><p>Ousterhout's book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tcl and the Tk
Toolkit</em></span>, contains exhaustive material on linking the Tcl
interpreter with your C programs. What this generally entails is
having your program produce or read Tcl commands from some source
and pass the commands, as strings, to the Tcl interpreter
functions, which return the result of evaluating and executing the
Tcl expressions.</p><p>While this mechanism is certainly useful, there are several
drawbacks. First of all, it requires the programmer to learn the
details of interfacing their C code with the Tcl interpreter. While
this is not usually difficult, it means that the programmer must
not only work partly in C and partly in Tcl (which may be an
unfamiliar language at first), but also learn the details of using
the Tcl library routines. In most cases this requires the program
to be reorganized to some extent&mdash;for example, the program's
<b  >main</b> function is replaced with a Tcl &ldquo;event
loop&rdquo;.</p><p>The other drawback is that the Tcl and Tk libraries are
literally huge&mdash;linking against them produces executables over a
megabyte in size. Although there are now Tcl and Tk shared
libraries available, this is a design concern for some.</p><p>The basic paradigm presented by this approach is that one
implements new Tcl functions in C, and those Tcl functions can be
called from a script which uses your program as a Tcl/Tk
interpreter&mdash;a replacement for <b  >wish</b> for your
particular application.</p><p>My solution to this problem is perhaps less powerful, but
also much more straightforward from the point-of-view of the
programmer. The idea is to fork an instance of
<b  >wish</b> as a child process of your C program and
talk to <b  >wish</b> via two pipes.
<b  >wish</b>, being a separate process, isn't linked
directly to your C program. It is used as a &ldquo;server&rdquo; for Tcl and Tk
commands&mdash;you send Tcl/Tk commands down the pipe to
<b  >wish</b>, which executes them (say, by creating
buttons, drawing graphics, whatever). You can have
<b  >wish</b> print strings to its standard output in
response to events (say, when the user clicks a button in the
<b  >wish</b> window)--your C program can receive these
strings from the read pipe and act upon them.</p><p>This mechanism is more in line with the Unix philosophy of
using small tools to handle particular tasks. Your C program
concerns itself with application-specific processing, and simply
writing Tcl/Tk commands to a pipe. <b  >wish</b> concerns
itself with executing these commands.</p><p>This solution also gets around the problem of having a
separate <b  >wish</b> replacement for each application
that you write using Tcl and Tk. In this way, all applications can
execute the same copy of <b  >wish</b> and communicate
with it in different ways.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="0044f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1
</p></div></div><p>This month, I'm going to demonstrate a &ldquo;real world&rdquo;
application which uses these concepts. My machine vision research
at Cornell required me to visualize three-dimensional point sets.
(For the curious, the problem dealt with feature classification:
for each region in an image, five features were quantified, such as
average intensity, Canny edge density, and so forth. The problem is
to classify like regions by treating each region as a point in a
five-dimensional feature space, and group regions together using
the k-nearest neighbor clustering algorithm. I needed to take a 3D
slice of this 5D space, assign a type to each point, and view it in
realtime by rotating, scaling and so forth. This would allow me to
verify that my features were clustering well.) Essentially, it's a
simple scientific visualization program for the task at hand; this
was much easier to write, using Tcl and Tk, than working with the
large visualization packages that were available. Additionally, I
could customize it to taste.</p><p>This program reads in a datafile consisting of 3D
coordinates, one per point. Each point is also assigned a &ldquo;type&rdquo;,
which is an integer from 0 to 6. Each point is given a simple
3D-to-2D transformation and plotted with a different color, based
on the type. A <b  >wish</b> canvas widget is used to do
the plotting; <b  >wish</b> provides scrollbars to allow
you to rotate and scale the dataset. Figure 1 (above) shows what
the program looks like on a sample dataset of about 70
points.</p><p>Note that the original version of this program contained
other features, such as the option to display axes. I have trimmed
down the code considerably in order for it to fit here.</p><p>The first thing that we need is some way to start up a child
process and talk to it via two pipes. (Two pipes are used in this
implementation: one for writing to the child, and one for reading
from it. In the end I found this simpler than synchronizing the use
of a single pipe.)</p><p>Here is the code, which I call <b  >child.c</b>, to
do this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/* child.c */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;
#include "child.h"
/* Exec the named cmd as a child process, returning
 * two pipes to communicate with the process, and
 * the child's process ID */
int start_child(char *cmd, FILE **readpipe, FILE
        **writepipe) {
   int childpid, pipe1[2], pipe2[2];
   if ((pipe(pipe1) &lt; 0) || (pipe(pipe2) &lt; 0)) {
        perror("pipe"); exit(-1);
}
   if ((childpid = vfork()) &lt; 0) {
     perror("fork"); exit(-1);
   } else if (childpid &gt; 0) {  /* Parent. */
     close(pipe1[0]); close(pipe2[1]);
     /* Write to child is pipe1[1], read from
      * child is pipe2[0].  */
     *readpipe = fdopen(pipe2[0],"r");
     *writepipe=fdopen(pipe1[1],"w");
     setlinebuf(*writepipe);
     return childpid;
   } else {  /* Child. */
     close(pipe1[1]); close(pipe2[0]);
     /* Read from parent is pipe1[0], write to
      * parent is pipe2[1].  */
     dup2(pipe1[0],0);
     dup2(pipe2[1],1);
     close(pipe1[0]); close(pipe2[1]);
     if (execlp(cmd,cmd,NULL) &lt; 0)
        perror("execlp");
     /* Never returns */
} }
</pre><p>If you're familiar with Unix systems programming, this is a
cookbook function. We use vfork (fork would do as well) to start a
child process, and in the child execlp the command passed to the
function. The command passed to start_child must be on your path
when using this function; also, you can't pass command-line
arguments to the command. It's easy to add the code to do this, but
we don't show this here for sake of brevity.</p><p>We use dup2 to connect the child's standard input to the
write pipe, and the child's standard output to the read pipe. In
this way anything that the child prints to stdout will show up on
readpipe, and anything the parent writes to writepipe will show up
on the child's stdin. In the parent, we use fdopen to treat the
pipes as stdio FILE pointers, and setlinebuf to force the write
pipe to be flushed whenever we send a newline. This saves us the
trouble of using fflush each time we write strings to the
pipe.</p><p>The header file, child.h, simply contains a prototype for
start_child. It should be included in any code which uses the above
function.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#ifndef _mdw_CHILD_H
#define _mdw_CHILD_H
#include stdio.h
#include sys/types.h
#include sys/time.h
extern int start_child(char *cmd,
        FILE **readpipe, FILE **writepipe);
#endif
</pre><p>Now, we can write a C program to call start_child to execute
<b  >wish</b> as a child process. We write Tcl/Tk
commands to writepipe, and read responses back from
<b  >wish</b> on readpipe. For example, we can have
<b  >wish</b> print a string to stdout whenever a button
is pressed or a scrollbar moved; our C program will see this string
and act upon it.</p><p>Here is the code, <b  >splot.c</b>, which
implements the 3D dataset viewer.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

gcc -O2 -o splot splot.c child.c -lm

 50 -50 -50 1
-50  50 -50 2
-50 -50  50 3

 50 -50  50 5
 50  50 -50 1
 50  50  50 2
</pre><p>(This particular dataset defines a cube. The fourth column
indicates the type, or color, of each point.)
<b  >load_points</b> reads each line and returns the
values as a linked list of type <b  >point_list</b>.
Next, we use <b  >start_child</b> to fire up wish.
Anything written to <b  >write_to</b> will be read by
wish as a Tcl/Tk command. First we send the command source
<b  >splot.tcl</b>, which causes wish to read the script
<b  >splot.tcl</b>, shown below.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p>Nearly everything in this script was introduced in the
December issue; if you can't follow it, check the Tcl/Tk manpages
for scrollbar, button, and so forth (or order back issues).</p><p>After telling wish to read <b  >splot.tcl</b>, the
program goes into a read loop, using fgets to read lines from the
read pipe. This causes splot to sleep until there is data on the
pipe to be read. If you wanted your program to continue running
while waiting for output from wish, there are several alternatives.
You could call select to poll for pending data on the pipe, or you
could set the pipe to use non-blocking I/O (see the man page for
<b  >fcntl</b>). Any book on Unix systems programming can
help.</p><p>Whenever the scrollbars are moved, they call the replot
function within <b  >splot.tcl</b>. This prints a line
beginning with the letter &ldquo;p&rdquo;, followed by the name of the canvas
widget to draw to, the values of the rotation and scale scrollbars,
and the half-height of the canvas widget. This latter is used to
center the image in the canvas when it is drawn.</p><p>Note that we must flush stdout after writing a command to it.
Otherwise the commands would be buffered and not sent immediately
to <b  >splot</b>.</p><p>Once splot receives this line, it uses
<b  >sscanf</b> to parse the values and calls <b  >plot_points</b>.
This function implements a very simple, but relatively fast, 3D
perspective transform, and applies it to each point. For each
point, we send wish a <b  >canvas</b> command to create
an oval object based upon its 2D location after the transform. The
variable half is used to center the point set on the canvas. The
<b  >colornames</b> array is indexed with the type field
of each point structure to set the color.</p><p>There you have it! A complete visualization program in a few
kilobytes of C and Tcl code. Try it out: Enter the above code,
compile it, and run the program as <b  >splot
cube.dat</b> where <b  >cube.dat</b> contains the
dataset for the 3D cube given above. You should be able to tumble
and scale the cube in the wish window. On my systems, this is
remarkably fast&mdash;I can view datasets of several hundred points with
very little noticeable lag.</p><p>However, the idea here is to code all of the speed-critical
parts of the program in C, and allow wish to handle just the user
interface. Remember that Tcl and Tk passes everything around as
scripts, so the tighter your Tcl code, the better. For example,
note how we do the degree-to-radian conversion and point scaling in
the C code. Using a <b  >Tcl expr</b> command to do the
same would require greater overhead.</p><p>There are many possible extensions to this program. For
example, you could add buttons or additional scrollbars to
<b  >splot.tcl</b> which would cause other kinds of
commands to be printed to wishs <b  >stdout</b>. The read
loop in splot, for example, could do a switch based on the first
character of the line received from wish and perform different
actions based on that. As long as your C code and Tcl script agree
on the command format used, you're &ldquo;cooking with gas&rdquo;.</p><p>Please feel free to get in touch with me if you have
questions about this code or problems getting it to work for you. I
suggest picking up a copy of John Ousterhout's book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tcl
and the Tk Toolkit</em></span>, from Addison-Wesley, as well as a
book on Unix systems programming, which will cover the details of
using pipes for interprocess communication.</p><p>Until next time, happy hacking.</p></div></div>
