    Last month I described the considerable success Virginia Power has
    enjoyed
    using Linux as the basis for a distributed data collection and archiving
    system. Well, Time marches on, Linux marches on and one of the cardinal
    rules of the Universe manifests itself: Anything that works tends to get
    used. A lot. And frequently in unexpected ways. Linux, blissfully so,
    is no exception.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1580580.0x16783a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>This article describes an exciting and
important new system that is being built on Virginia Power's Linux
platform&mdash;a virtual SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition) system that will provide a cost-effective and flexible
alternative to traditional SCADA connectivity. Whereas last month's
story was an epic software adventure with a cast of several, this
month's story is more of a documentary of the new additions being
added to our Linux house. As this is being written, the frame is
up, the roof is on, and the drywall is in place. However, the
joists are still visible and a good bit of plumbing has yet to be
added. Don't worry&mdash;with virtual hard hats in place and source code
hammers handy, we should be able to visualize the finished rooms
easily. (Besides, as you read this, the system is finished.
Magazines are wonderful time machines.)
</p><p>But first, for those of you who may have missed last month's
article, a little foundation on SCADA. As far as electric utilities
are concerned, SCADA means the retrieval of real-time analog and
status data from various locations in the service territory through
remote terminal units (RTUs) installed in substations. This
information is obtained by central master computers, where it is
stored, analyzed, and presented to system operators who are
responsible for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the
transmission and distribution grid. When necessary, these operators
can also remotely operate field devices like line breakers and
capacitor banks by sending control commands from the master
computer out to the RTUs. The master computers themselves even
contain feedback algorithms that automatically operate some devices
based on system conditions.</p><p>At Virginia Power, the standard medium of communication
between RTUs and SCADA master computers is the dedicated serial
line, often leased from the local phone company. Several RTUs can
be multi-dropped off a single dedicated line (up to 16, a
limitation imposed by our currently-used SCADA protocol), but
geographical limitations tend to prevent as much sharing of
dedicated lines as might be desirable. At the risk of
over-simplifying, we can imagine one dedicated line per RTU, giving
us a traditional SCADA system something like that shown in Figure 1
(see below).</p><p>The advantages of a dedicated connection are pretty obvious:
constant data availability and quick response when system
conditions require a control action of some sort (such as opening
or closing a breaker or capacitor bank). In the case of generation
stations or large, high-voltage substations, any other type of
monitoring is unthinkable.</p><p>Yet, there are other likely monitoring sites, often in remote
locations (the exact technical phrase is &ldquo;in the middle of
nowhere&rdquo;) which are not quite so high profile (or high pressure).
As a matter of fact, in a data acquisition sense, these potential
sites are downright <span   class="emphasis"><em>prosaic</em></span>: two or three
analog points, a couple of status points, and perhaps a single control point. Such modest monitoring needs don't justify the constant watchfulness a dedicated serial line provides, but the information does need to be retrieved; the control capabilities do need to be available when needed.</p><p><a href="1015f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Traditional SCADA Connectivity</b></span></a></p><p><a href="1015f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2. A
Hybrid SCADA System</b></span></a></p><p>Over the years some partial solutions have been implemented.
In many cases, intelligent electronic devices such as digital
relays can monitor a small number of analog and status devices and
supply sufficient control capabilities. These relays usually
implement a simple serial-based protocol; installed in remote sites along with
modems, they can be interrogated from the SCADA master computer
centers using stand-alone PC packages, resulting in a hybrid SCADA
system as shown in Figure 2 (see above).</p><p>Such a hybrid system, while it may provide (in one form or
another) all necessary data and control capabilities, fails to
provide the system operators with a unified picture of the system
they are operating. These folks have enough responsibility on their
hands without having to run through mental gyrations along the
lines of: &ldquo;I'd better check the voltages in the Berry district.
Oops&mdash;the Cranberry substation has to be dialed, so I'll just walk
over here to the dialup PC and...oh, heck. Ted's using the PC to
dial the Mineral Water substation! Guess I'll try later...&rdquo;</p><p>Of course, a second dialup PC could be purchased and then a
third and a fourth and&mdash;Whoa&mdash;just a minute! What about those
eminently reliable and flexible Linux systems in each and every
SCADA master computer center? (I know you saw this coming.) Not
only are those Linux systems handling averaged analog data for the
Asset Management database system, but they are also an eminently
reliable and flexible dialing subsystem (I blush to admit this, but
there you are) which can potentially talk to any type of device
with a byte-oriented protocol!</p><p>The dialing subsystem has no set limit on the number of phone
lines it can handle. If some means could be found to move data back
and forth between the SCADA master computers and the Linux systems,
a more ideal SCADA system could be constructed, as shown in Figure
3 (see below). This would provide the system operators with a
unified overview of their system&mdash;all information would be present
in the SCADA master computer. Some of it would be retrieved via
traditional means (dedicated lines) and the rest would be obtained
via dialup connections through the Linux systems.</p><p><a href="1015f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.
Ideal, Unified SCADA System</b></span></a></p><p>As you can probably guess, this last approach is pretty much
the one we're taking, although a few sobering, but fortunately not
insurmountable, realities of the Real World have intruded:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Our SCADA master computers are older machines which
are approaching the end of their digital careers. There are no
spare processor cycles (or memory bytes) for any kind of special
programs to accommodate talking with our Linux systems. In fact,
the only feasible way to move data between our Linux systems and
our SCADA computers is by using the same protocol as is used to
communicate with our RTUs. Alas, this protocol is more than a
little antiquated and uses special-purpose modems and encoding
firmware.</p></li><li><p>Dialing devices and retrieving data is all well and
good, but sometimes system operators need to monitor data points
continuously for a certain period of time.</p></li><li><p>When operators perform control actions on remote
devices, they need to see immediate feedback to determine the
success or failure of the controls. Some actions can potentially
affect several different data points, and these need to be updated
in real time until the operators are satisfied as to the results of
their control actions.</p></li></ul></div><p>With regard to the first item, we are lucky enough to have
available an RTU platform for which our group develops
field-resident applications, such as closed-loop feedback controls
and protocol translators for IEDs. This platform, obviously,
contains all of the requisite firmware and hardware for talking to
our SCADA master computers and is fully programmable (in C, thank
goodness). Stripped of all unnecessary peripheral hardware and
loaded with a simple byte-oriented protocol to talk to our Linux systems over a null modem cable, this programmable
RTU functions quite handily as a translator box: status and analog
data can be delivered from dialup devices to the SCADA computer,
and control requests can be delivered from the SCADA computer to
the Linux system for appropriate action. Of course, all the SCADA
computer knows is that it is scanning another RTU. The result is a
slightly tempered ideal system as shown in Figure 4.</p><p><a href="1015f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4.
Unified SCADA System, Real World Edition</b></span></a></p><p>At this point, I'd like to mention a few details of software
carpentry which will be important when we discuss the remaining
items in our Real World reality list. The database of the
translator box (i.e., the stripped-down programmable RTU which
talks to the SCADA master computer) is organized as a set of arrays
of data structures&mdash;one array for status points, another for analog
points, etc. On the Linux side, a corresponding set of
shared-memory partitions mirrors the arrays of data structures in
the translator box&mdash;one partition for status points, another for
analogs, etc. A daemon process in Linux talks to a counterpart
process on the translator box and ensures that the corresponding
instances of structure arrays remain consistent and up-to-date.
This update process runs every few seconds.</p><p>&ldquo;Every few seconds&rdquo; may sound a trifle vague in connection
with real-time data processing, but SCADA activity tends toward the
leisurely side of real-time processing; RTUs are scanned once every
2 to 30 seconds, contact closures during control actions may be on
the order of several hundred milliseconds to a second or two. So
even though Linux (like any standard Unix system) is not strictly
speaking a real-time system, it is more than responsive enough for
the scale of real-time processing with which we're
concerned.</p><p>Well, now&mdash;the important points to remember are these: A
change to data in a shared memory segment in the Linux system will
show up in the translator box, where it will be picked up and
scanned by the SCADA master computer, eventually showing up on an
operator display. Conversely, an operator-control action will
change data in the translator box, which will show up on the Linux
side and ring a (virtual) bell to cause some action to take place.
From now on, we'll ignore the translator box and pretend that the
SCADA master computer and Linux system are speaking directly to one
another.</p><p>Which brings us, in a roundabout way, to the second Real
World item. As noted before, continuous data monitoring is one of
the advantages of dedicated-line connectivity. Simulating
dedicated-line access with regular phone lines is obviously why
we're calling our new system a virtual SCADA system, and the basic
principle is just as obvious: when continuous monitoring is needed
for a dialup device, dial up and stay dialed up!</p><p>Of course, at any given time, it is only possible to
continuously monitor as many dial-up devices as there are available
phone lines&mdash;but more phone lines can always be added, should the
need arise. We're starting with three dial-up serial ports per
Linux machine; time and experience will tell if we need to add
more. But some complications arise (as always) in the details. For
example, what happens if an operator starts continuously monitoring
a dial-up device, gets caught up in some other task, and forgets to
release the device so the dial-up line can be used for some other
purpose? For that matter, how does the operator start and stop
monitoring a device in the first place?</p><p>To handle these details, each dial-up device has associated
with it a number of pseudo status, analog and control
points&mdash;points which have nothing to do with the data being
monitored by the device, but rather are related to the device
itself:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A <span   class="emphasis"><em>timestamp</em></span> analog point,
showing how old the device data is (i.e., the last time the device
was called).</p></li><li><p>A <span   class="emphasis"><em>connection</em></span> status point,
showing whether the device is on-line or not.</p></li><li><p>A <span   class="emphasis"><em>dial-up</em></span> control point.
Toggling this control will cause the device to be dialed and a
connection established.</p></li><li><p>A <span   class="emphasis"><em>connect-time</em></span> analog point,
showing how many minutes remain before the device is automatically
disconnected.</p></li><li><p>An <span   class="emphasis"><em>add-connect-time</em></span> control
point. Toggling this point will add a fixed number of minutes to
the connect-time analog, keeping the device on-line longer.</p></li><li><p>A <span   class="emphasis"><em>disconnect</em></span> control point, to
disconnect from the device immediately.</p></li></ul></div><p>An additional pseudo-analog point reports the number of
available dial-up lines. This analog point is displayed, along with
the above-described pseudo points, for all dial-up devices on a
SCADA master computer screen, allowing the system operator easy,
centralized management of all dial-up devices.</p><p>As an example, let's replay our hypothetical scenario from a
few paragraphs back: &ldquo;I'd better check the voltages in the Berry
district. Lessee&mdash;the Cranberry substation has to be dialed, so
I'll just poke this control point right here at the comfort of my
workstation...&rdquo;</p><p>A little time passes while the device is dialed; the operator
stays busy with other things. Then the connect pseudo-status
changes state and dings an alarm beeper to attract the operator's
attention: &ldquo;Hmm...Cranberry's online now. I'd better keep an eye on
those voltages for half an hour or so. I'll poke this add-time
control a couple of times...There we go; now I've got 30 minutes of
connect time.&rdquo;</p><p>Okay, so it's not a perfect solution; the operator still has
to perform some special actions to get his data, and has to know
what's a dial-up device and what's not. But all of these extra
activities can be done at the operator's regular workstation. And
if dial-up devices are scheduled for periodic interrogation, some
of these special actions may not even be necessary: &ldquo;I'd better
check the voltages in the Berry district. Say, it looks like the
Cranberry substation was interrogated just 10 minutes ago&mdash;recently
enough that I can use those values...&rdquo;</p><p>As you might imagine, handling pseudo-points and connection
timers involves much delightful software development on the Linux
side, some of which is still in the blueprint stages and some
needing only a final coat of symbol-stripping paint. The solution
to the final item in our list of Real World realities&mdash;providing
operator controls to dial-up devices&mdash;is still, pretty much, in the
blueprint stage, but we can at least describe the basic
ideas.</p><p>The main problem with dial-up device controls is providing
sufficient generalization so that control actions are handled in a
consistent manner. The standard method for controlling SCADA
devices is a three-step select-verify-execute procedure: select the
point to be controlled, verify the selection (usually by having the
remote device echo the selection back to the master computer), and
execute the desired control after a final go-ahead by the operator.
The result of a control action is usually determined by monitoring
an associated status point or one or more analog points.</p><p>Unfortunately, many of the intelligent end devices we are
handling using virtual SCADA don't have clear- cut sequences of
steps for performing control actions. One device, for example, uses
an ASCII-encoded bitmap to select the device and execute the
control, all in one step&mdash;so much for verification. Another device
implements the usual 3-step procedure but with the added onus of
sequence numbers to ensure no more than one outstanding control
action at a time (actually, not at all a bad idea, but incompatible
with our existing SCADA protocol). And there is the obvious
prerequisite, that the device to be controlled must be on-line
before any control is attempted.</p><p>A little poor-man's object-orientation seems to be in order,
so we have abstracted the basic elements of a control request and,
along the way, added a few more pseudo-points per dial-up device
(these additional pseudo-points are displayed on the same screen as
all the other device pseudo-points):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A <span   class="emphasis"><em>connection-in-progress</em></span>
status point, which toggles true if the associated device is in the
process of being dialed.</p></li><li><p>A <span   class="emphasis"><em>control-in-progress</em></span> status
point, which is true if a control is being performed on the
associated device.</p></li><li><p>A <span   class="emphasis"><em>control-success</em></span> status
point, showing success or failure of the last control
attempted.</p></li></ul></div><p>The operator can perform a control on any dial-up device
control point, just as he does with any other (dedicated-line)
control point, with the understanding that his control action is
actually a request for the control to be selected, verified, and
executed on his behalf at some time in the (near) future. This
distinction may seem cosmetic, but it is actually important, from
an operational point of view.</p><p>Here's the general sequence of events: The operator controls
a dial-up device control point (using the usual 3-step procedure,
since he is communicating his request to the Linux system using the
regular SCADA protocol), which toggles a database point in the
Linux system, alerting the system that there's work to be done. The
system sets the <span   class="emphasis"><em>control-in-progress</em></span> status
point to ensure that only one control request per device is
outstanding at a time. Since the number of separate control points
per dial-up device is small, this restriction should not pose a
problem.</p><p>If the device to be controlled is not online, it is dialed
and a connection is established (the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>connection-in-progress</em></span> status point allows
monitoring of this process). If the device is already on-line, a
set amount of time is added to its
<span   class="emphasis"><em>connect-time</em></span> analog to allow for completion of
the control request.</p><p>Device-specific software, knowing all the secrets for
successful control actions on the device, performs the control
requested by the operator, and reports the general success or
failure through the <span   class="emphasis"><em>control-success</em></span> status
point. The device remains on-line until its
<span   class="emphasis"><em>connect-time</em></span> analog counts down to zero,
allowing the operator an opportunity to observe any associated
analogs or status points to verify that the control action has the
desired effect.</p><p>Well, we've just about reached the end of our tour of this
latest addition to our network of Linux systems, and I hope you've
gotten a good idea of what the finished rooms will look like and
the wonderful view we'll have of the increased efficiency and
reliable operation of our SCADA systems. But the most remarkable
feature of this new system hasn't yet been mentioned, although it
has been implied in everything discussed so far.</p><p>Linux has become an integral, accepted part of the toolkit we
use to craft solutions for the division and planning personnel who
come to our group with problems and needs. During the design of our
virtual SCADA system, no one suggested using some &ldquo;other&rdquo; operating
system platform or questioned whether Linux would have enough
horsepower to handle the new demands that would be placed upon it.
A year of stellar, faultless Linux performance as our
data-collection front ends has turned skepticism to happy
acceptance and transformed the phrase &ldquo;that PC Unix&rdquo; to &ldquo;our Linux
systems.&rdquo; Folks I've never met who work in our company, call up
with Linux questions because they've heard good things about our
systems.</p><p>Oh, we still have a skeptic or two&mdash;I'm sure we always will.
But the surest way I've found to get them off my back, after
they've expounded on the next release of &ldquo;Ontario&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pookeepsie
96&rdquo; or &ldquo;Shangra-La&rdquo;, is to cough politely and reply, &ldquo;Well, Linux
does that right now. And it works. Right now. See?&rdquo;</p><p>The ones that come back, I tell `em how to get a good CD-ROM
distribution. One more happy Linuxer can't hurt!</p></div></div>
