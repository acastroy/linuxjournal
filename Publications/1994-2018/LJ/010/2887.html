thoroughly like Linux! I have come across a problem, however, that
I am having difficulty correcting.</p><p>My system at home is a Packard Bell Legend 1170. Yes, I'm
aware of all the jokes/stories/ etc.,...we'll skip that part! I
like my computer and it serves my purposes fine for now.</p><p>I have upgraded it to 8mb of RAM, added a PowerGraph video
card and most recently installed a new Zoom modem to replace the
built-in 2400 that PB uses. During the installation, I discovered
that the original built-in modem could not be physically removed,
but COM PORT 1 could be disabled. Therefore I disabled COM PORT 1
and set my new modem up for COM PORT 3. The comm program in the DOS partition of my computer works fine with
the modem (14.4k beats 2400bd all to pieces!).</p><p>The question I have been struggling with is how do I tell my
Linux partition to go to COM PORT 3? I've checked with other Linux
users and the Linux manual and the common response (other than
&ldquo;replace the computer&rdquo; or &ldquo;sue PB&rdquo;) is that I should create a cua3
in dev. But the problem is there is already a cua0, 1, 2, and 3;
so, obviously, the problem is not creating it, but making the
connection somehow.</p><p>I am sure this is a relatively easy problem that someone more
familiar with Linux and more technically proficient than I, can
solve easily. I certainly would appreciate any information you may
be able to provide me, even if it's a page number and a note to
RTM! Great&mdash;I'll find it and read it!</p><p>Thank you and keep up the good work with the magazine. It is
one of the very few that seems to consider those of us who are not
computer wizards by publishing articles that are easily read and
understood even by a novice such as myself. The series on Andrew
was great and I find it does indeed live up to all the
claims!</p><p>Thanks again.Donald R. Barnhart

told otherwise. There is a Serial HOWTO at sunsite.unc.edu in
/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/ that will tell you what you need to
know.</p><p>I'm not sure what you mean by &ldquo;tell my Linux partition to go
to COM PORT 3&rdquo;. What software are you using the modem with under
Linux? Kermit? Seyon? Something else? You probably need to
configure the program you are using to connect to the correct port.
You may have a file /dev/modem which is linked to the previously
correct port, and you may need to remake the link:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rm /dev/modem
ln -s /dev/cua2 /dev/modem
</pre><p>assuming your modem is correctly installed on cua2.</p><p>The other very important thing to consider is the IRQ
setting. The modem should not share an IRQ with any other serial
line on the computer. The setserial program, which comes with most
Linux distributions and can also be retrieved with ftp from
tsx-11.mit.edu, is the program to use to make sure that Linux knows
what IRQ your modem is on. Again, the Serial HOWTO can help you
with this.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16fa580.0x17f2768"></a>Tcl Thanks</h2></div></div><p>I want to thank Matt Welsh for writing the article &ldquo;X Window
System Programming with Tcl and TK&rdquo; (<i  >LJ</i> #8). I see a way now to add
an X windows interface to my slow port of a DOS style BBS to Linux.
I have started the task of moving the simplex BBS software to
Linux. Simplex is interesting because it is a complete fidonet BBS
package. I mean it can import fido echomail and netmail. I don't
know of a BBS for Linux that can do this.</p><p>I think that the article was very well written and I enjoyed
reading it and fooling around with Tcl/Tk. I can hardly wait for
the one explaining how to do this from C.</p><p>P.S. A list of Linux user groups would be a nice addition.
Thank you for all you have done for Linux and the Linux
community!Geoffrey Robert

We have begun
publishing a BBS list in this issue (see page 44); BBS sysops are
encouraged to send us information about their Linux-specific (or
even better, Linux-hosted) BBSs.</p><p>As far as Linux User Groups, see page 39 of the November
issue and page 46 of the December issue. Our biggest problem in
creating a list of Linux User Groups has been that most of the
groups have not contacted us to volunteer information.</p><p>See page 26 for Matt's latest article: Using Tcl and Tk from
your C programs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16fa580.0x17f2be0"></a>Not Again!</h2></div></div><p>Hi! First off, thanks for <i  >Linux Journal</i>.
I have a comment about a particular command in the article &ldquo;Linux
Tips: How to move /home to a new hard drive on your Linux system&rdquo;
in December's issue.</p><p>The command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cp -r /home/* /mnt
</pre><p>as suggested to copy the home directory does not copy
symbolic or hard links correctly. (I am not sure about the other
command suggested for I don't have cpio on my system.) If the user
has many links, she will find that the &ldquo;copy&rdquo; in /mnt takes up more
disk space. The following command will copy links correctly:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(cd /home ; tar cf - .) | (cd /mnt ; tar xvf -)

(correct) response. I never use <b  >cp -r</b> myself,

the note.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16fa580.0x17f3108"></a>Arithmetic</h2></div></div><p>The control port which corresponds with printer data port
0x378 is 0x37a, and not 0x380, as described in Kernel Korner,
December issue (#8). Why is it required that the example user space
printer driver be compiled with optimization turned on? And what
level opt?David
Morris <a href="mailto:dwm@shell.portal.com">dwm@shell.portal.com</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16fa580.0x17f3268"></a>Michael Responds:</h2></div></div><p>You are absolutely right; I must have been writing too late
at night. Fortunately, this mistake was not propagated into the
userlp.c code that was included in the article; there, I let the
computer do the arithmetic, so that I couldn't accidentally replace
hex arithmetic with decimal arithmetic. The reason I was working in
decimal was that I had just been working on the shell script
version which I mentioned but didn't include in the article, where
I had to do all the arithmetic in decimal. Perhaps that is another
good reason not to try to write device drivers as shell
scripts.</p><p>The reason that the userlp.c program included has to be
compiled with optimization (of any level at all) turned on is that
all the port I/O functions are defined in the header files as
&ldquo;static inline&rdquo; functions, a GCC extension is enabled only by
turning on optimization. I'm sorry that was not adequately
addressed in the article.</p></div></div>
