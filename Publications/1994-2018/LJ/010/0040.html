are you? Where did you go to school and what did you study? What
are your hobbies?
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Olaf Kirch:</b></span> I'm 28 and right
now I'm working as a developer for a small company in the CAD/CAM
business. I studied math and computer science at Darmstadt
University, Germany, and graduated about one year ago.</p><p>One of the things I do in my spare time is, of course, tend
Linux boxes, but I also read and paint a bit. And</p><p>I like bicycling. On my holidays, I love to go hiking with a
backpack&mdash;the farther away from any terminal, the better.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i>:</b></span> How did you start using
Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Olaf:</b></span> I installed my first
Linux system from an MCC Interim distribution some time back in
1992. Before that, my home box was an Atari running Minix, which
was a little painful. When I heard of Linux, I instantly junked the
Atari and bought a PC. I got the MCC release from some kind soul
who offered a gratis copying service on German Usenet. You only had
to send him seven floppies...</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i>:</b></span> As the principal author
of the Linux Network Administrator's Guide, you have helped a lot
of Linux users. How did you get started?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Olaf:</b></span> I got into the whole
project almost by accident. Initially, I meant to contribute only a
UUCP chapter to the System Administrator's Guide. When I followed
up with a chapter on smail and released it to the DOC channel on
Linux Activists, I mused aloud &ldquo;Wouldn't it be nice to have an
entire Networking Guide?&rdquo; &ldquo;Hey, great,&rdquo; everyone said, &ldquo;I'd say, go
for it!&rdquo; I was trapped.</p><p>Early on, progress was rather slow, because I wasn't as
comfortable with English as I thought. But the people on the DOC
channel were very helpful, and I got lots of reviews. My most
important reviewer was Andy Oram at O'Reilly, who got involved in
the book in late 1993.</p><p>Unfortunately, I also had to write my MS thesis, but in the
end it worked out well. I'm only glad my prof never caught me in
the terminal room.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i>:</b></span> You say you &ldquo;trapped&rdquo;
yourself into writing the NAG. Were you a networking guru when you
started writing it?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Olaf:</b></span> No, not at all. I had
hacked on UUCP and various mailers like smail2 and umail, but my
ideas about TCP/IP networking, etc., were rather foggy. To put it
more bluntly, I was just another clueless newbie then. But I was
very curious, so I got myself some books, pestered developers with
stupid questions and spent endless hours browsing source code. BTW
(by the way), that's one of the main lessons I learned from the
whole thing: If you don't know how something works, read the
source. It really helps.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i>:</b></span> Do you have a network at
home or just a single computer?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Olaf:</b></span> Most of the time, I
have only one computer at home, so I have to test a lot of things
using only local loopback. I do have some friends, however, who are
running networked Linux boxes and they always call me when they
have a problem or want to install new applications. This way I can
try out everything on their networks; this has the added benefit
that if anything goes wrong, their machines go down, not
mine.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i>:</b></span> What is your connection
to the Internet?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Olaf:</b></span> I get mail and news
via UUCP from brewhq, our domain's main hub that has an Internet
uplink via ISDN. For interactive things like FTP, I use a SLIP
link, but I hope to have ISDN, too, some time soon.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i>:</b></span> What future do you see
for the NAG? Do you intend to keep revising it to keep it up to
date?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Olaf:</b></span> Yes, I do, at least
for a while. The basic network administration issues in Linux don't
change that rapidly at the moment, so I think I'll release updates
every few months.</p><p>Of course, I'm aware there's a lot going on that I didn't
cover in the NAG, like IPX, ham radio and so on.</p><p>I also had offers from people who wanted to write something
on sendmail V8, INN and the BSD automounter. On the other hand, I
feel the book is already rather hefty, so</p><p>I'll probably not add any new sections. Maybe there will be a
sequel, but don't hold your breath.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i>:</b></span> Maybe a Basic Linux
Network Administrator's Guide and an Advanced Linux Network
Administrators Guide?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Olaf:</b></span> I'm thinking more of a
collection of papers, a little like the management documents in the
4.4BSD System Manager's Manual. I would want to make it less closed
than the NAG itself, so that different people can contribute more
easily. I had very firm ideas about how detailed the networking
guide should be, up to the point that some people considered it
&ldquo;dumbed down&rdquo;. Vince Skahan, who wrote the sendmail chapter never
complained, but I think I badgered him quite a lot. For the sequel,
I would lend people a hand at writing something, without imposing
my views on them.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i>:</b></span> What suggestions do you
have for those people who are interested in learning about topics
you decided not to cover? How can they learn about them?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Olaf:</b></span> That depends. For some
packages, like INN, a quite exhaustive FAQ is distributed on the
Net. For sendmail V8, you can always get the bat book from
O'Reilly. It's about the size of a brick, but very useful. The IPX
and AX.25 stuff is still largely undocumented, so your best bet is
to read the sources.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i>:</b></span> What has Linux done for
your professional life?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Olaf:</b></span> Difficult question.
People usually don't roll out the red carpet for you just because
you say, &ldquo;Hey, I wrote a book on Linux, why don't you hire me?&rdquo; On
my current job,</p><p>I don't get involved with network administration a lot. I'm
mainly coding C++ and Motif applications in an HP environment, but
I'm quite happy with it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i>:</b></span> In the preface of the
NAG, you say that one of your favorite sports is &ldquo;doing things with
sed that other people would reach for their perl interpreter for.&rdquo;
Do you have a favorite sed hack you would like to tell us
about?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Olaf:</b></span> First, let me say that
I don't believe perl is evil or anything. I just think that sed is
more fun, just the way the Obfuscated C Code Contest is. My
favorite sed hack is a short script I wrote that computes prime
numbers: If you give it a number n on standard input, it will print
all primes smaller than 2^n on standard out.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i>:</b></span> Will you give any hints
as to how you got that to work?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Olaf:</b></span> There's nothing magic
about it. The script is a simple sieve algorithm. The only tricky
thing is incrementing and decrementing numbers. You can do that by
shifting a marker from right to left, very much like a carry flag.
Say I have 7890@ as input and want to decrement it. Then I replace
0@ with @9, and continue. Any other digit is decremented by one and
the marker removed, i.e., 9@ becomes 8, 8@ becomes 7, etc. Quite
silly, I admit.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i>:</b></span> Thanks for taking the
time to do this interview!</p></div></div>
