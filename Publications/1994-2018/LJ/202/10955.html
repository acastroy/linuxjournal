downtimed&mdash;System Downtime Monitor
(<a href="http://dist.epipe.com/downtimed" target="_self">dist.epipe.com/downtimed</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
The following statement appears at the top of the downtimed Web site:
&ldquo;Why is it so easy to find out the server uptime, but so difficult to
figure out the downtime?&rdquo; And, it all seems so obvious in hindsight. According to the
Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
downtimed is a program for monitoring operating system downtime, uptime,
shutdowns and crashes and for keeping record of such events.
</p><p>
...downtimes is a command-line tool, which can be used to inspect previous
downtime records recorded in the downtime database file. 
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10955f1.large.jpg"><img src="10955f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
A program that should have existed years ago, downtimed is a
very simple 
tool for recording computer downtimes.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Source tarballs in both tar.gz and tar.xz format are available at the
Web site. As far as library requirements go, I didn't run into any hiccups
during installation, and I couldn't find anything about needed libraries,
so the requirements seemed very minimalist. As for the actual
installation, at least the first part is an easy process.
</p><p>
Grab the latest tarball from the Web site, extract it, and open a terminal
in the folder. From there, it's the usual:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure
$ make
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro uses sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro uses root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ su
# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
From here, things aren't so easy, and you should consult the documentation for
further instructions, so I'll leave the next steps to you at this stage. If you're lucky, someone will have made a binary for
your system, and in the case of Ubuntu, I found a custom
package at the Ubuntu Personal Package Archives at launchpad.net.
</p><p>
Assuming you were able to finish installing downtimed, you'll obviously
need to reset to complete the process.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Actually using downtimed is probably the easiest part, and it's possibly the
easiest program I've ever reviewed.
</p><p>
Open a terminal and enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ downtimes 
</pre>
</p><p>
If everything went properly during the installation, you should have
a record of your first shutdown, with a likely downtime of something
under a minute on modern distributions. downtimed is clever enough
to distinguish between a crash and a proper shutdown, which I tested
(after saving all of my work) by pressing the computer's reset switch. The
following night we had a power blackout of just a few seconds, and that
also registered as a crash. If you look at the screenshot included, you
can see that clean shutdowns are annotated to the left with a
&ldquo;down&rdquo;,
while others are marked with a &ldquo;crash&rdquo;.
</p><p>
That's pretty much all there is to it really. Of
course, the program can be extended in certain ways, such as specifying
another database file instead of the default and viewing uptimes,
but I'll let you explore those for yourself in the program's man pages.
</p><p>
In the end, this is one of those programs you can't help feel
should have existed already, but has come along only recently. I love
the program's simplicity, which in particular makes me think
this will become a mainstream tool. Distro makers take note: this should
be in your deployed systems by default, especially on server-style
distributions.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>Performous</em></span>
(<a href="http://performous.org" target="_self">performous.org</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
Describing this game is difficult. Under the heading of &ldquo;What is
it?&rdquo;, the Web site gives this simple statement:
&ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Performous</em></span> is a free
cross-platform music and rhythm game.&rdquo; But, that doesn't even begin to
describe this project.
</p><p>
After several days, all I can come up with is that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Performous</em></span> is a
cross between <span   class="emphasis"><em>Karaoke</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Guitar
Hero</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Rock Band</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Frets On
Fire</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>SingStar</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>StepMania</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dance Dance
Revolution</em></span>. 
</p><p>
Here's the feature list from the Web site, which should sum
things up nicely:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Should work on almost any platform.
</p></li><li><p>
Very accurate singing pitch detection. Noisy environments are not an issue.
Multiple simultaneous tones can be detected and separated properly.
</p></li><li><p>
Intelligent gameplay with guitar and bass. The engine determines what was
intended rather than simply picking the nearest chord. Hammer-ons and
pull-offs are undone when the player accidentally does them and then picks
the note in the regular way.
</p></li><li><p>
Drums.
</p></li><li><p>
Dance pads.
</p></li><li><p>
Device autodetection: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Guitar Hero</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Rock
Band</em></span> instruments, generic dance
pads, <span   class="emphasis"><em>SingStar</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Rock Band</em></span>
microphones, and fallback to other audio devices
when no SS/RB mics are detected.
</p></li><li><p>
Top-notch visuals: fully OpenGL-based rendering, music videos as
backgrounds, smooth UI animations and other eye candy.
</p></li><li><p>
Solid C++ engine: performs well on slower machines too. Rapid but still
safe development, thanks to advanced C++ features. Plenty of threaded stuff
like background loading of songs and videos.
</p></li><li><p>
Free software, licensed under GNU GPL version 2 or later.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10955f2.large.jpg"><img src="10955f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
In one of the most bizarre experiences of my life, here's a DDR-style
dance track to German metallers Rammstein! Only with OSS.

The open nature of <span  class="emphasis"><em>Performous</em></span> means alternative bands are as popular as
the mainstream. Here I'm drumming to Finnish band Nightwish.

</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
If you're chasing a binary package, there are all sorts available for
Ubuntu (I recommend the cutting-edge packages from PPA at Launchpad),
as well as Debian, openSUSE, Arch Linux and Mandriva. If you can get a
package, do so. A source tarball is available, but it's a long process
of chasing down dependencies. Nevertheless, in the interest of
distro-neutrality, I'm running with the source as usual. But strap yourself
in: we're in for a long one!
</p><p>
Luckily for me, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Performous</em></span> documentation is quite thorough. As for
library requirements, the docs say you need the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
OpenGL: graphics.
</p></li><li><p>
Boost: threads, parsers/conversions, pointer containers.
</p></li><li><p>
SDL: window management and input.
</p></li><li><p>
FFmpeg (avcodec, avformat and swscale): A/V decoding.
</p></li><li><p>
Cairo &gt;= 1.2: scalable graphical support.
</p></li><li><p>
librsvg: SVG rendering (themes).
</p></li><li><p>
libxml++: XML parser, used for themes, etc.
</p></li><li><p>
PortAudio v19: audio capture and playback.
</p></li><li><p>
Gettext (optional): for internationalization.
</p></li><li><p>
PortMidi (optional): for MIDI drum support.
</p></li><li><p>
OpenCV (optional): for Webcam support.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
However, I needed to install a lot of development packages, as well as
some dependencies I didn't see listed before I could continue. As for
my own system (Kubuntu), I had to install the following:
libboost-all-dev, libglew1.5-dev, libavutil-dev, libavcodec-dev,
libavformat-dev, libswscale-dev and libportaudio-dev.
</p><p>
Once you have the needed dependencies, download the latest tarball,
extract it, and open a terminal in the folder. Now, enter the following
commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro uses sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro uses root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ su
# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
Whether you're running from source or not, I <span   class="emphasis"><em>highly</em></span> recommend
installing <span   class="emphasis"><em>Frets On Fire</em></span>'s song files, as this gives the game a
selection of songs to choose from immediately. I also found an Ultrastar
song package at the PPA site, and if you can find similar packages,
I recommend installing them.
</p><p>
To run the game, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ performous
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
As the feature list suggests, the game <span   class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> autodetect any of the
devices from these popular rhythm/karaoke games. I don't have any of these
devices, so I can't verify its efficacy, but perhaps a PlayStation-ist
out there with all the equipment can tell me how it went.
</p><p>
If you're using the karaoke features, you'll want to test out your sound
levels in the Practice section before moving on to the game itself. If
you have only the basic <span   class="emphasis"><em>Frets On Fire</em></span> songs installed, for now you
will have only guitar songs, so I'll cover those first.
</p><p>
The five frets you'll be using are controlled with the number keys 1&ndash;5, with either R-Shift or Enter as the picking button. However, given
that you can use either button or both, I found that for super-fast sections
it helps to thrash between both buttons with two fingers.
</p><p>
This may sound sacrilegious, but instead of picking up the keyboard, I
found it easier to leave it in place on the desk, and just play it flat,
like a piano. I know, I know, you're meant to pick it up to simulate a
guitar or bass, but as someone who owns both a bass and a guitar, trust
me, it doesn't feel anything like either (not even with a GH controller).
</p><p>
However, you'll soon want to move on to other songs with other instruments
(you won't even be able to do karaoke with that selection), so I
recommend having a look around on the community boards for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Frets
On Fire</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SingStar</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>StepMania</em></span>. The
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Performous</em></span> documentation says it looks
for songs in several directories, but I had limited success. In the
end, I just copied my new songs into /usr/share/games/performous/songs,
and they worked without a hitch.
</p><p>
If you want to play a drum track, for instance, you need a song that's
had a drum track programmed with it. Assuming the song files are all where
they should be, it'll appear in your song menu the next time you start
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Performous</em></span>. If a song has multiple tracks and you want to play
only the drums, when the song is loaded, press one of the drum pads/buttons to
enable the drum mode (or a dance pad button for dance mode and so on). As
for bass, because it uses the same buttons as guitar mode, you need to
change from the default guitar mode to bass mode at the start of the song.
</p><p>
On <span   class="emphasis"><em>Performous</em></span>, I was able to play along to my favorite (and rarest)
tracks, and from a drummer's perspective, the user-made tracks are
actually a lot more realistic than the commercial ones.
</p><p>
Ultimately, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Performous</em></span> is both an ambitious and a
pragmatic concept.
People are playing the same selection of games anyway, so why not combine
them? And, given that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Performous</em></span> can use the real controllers, it means
I also can skip getting a PlayStation (I'd rather eat my own shins
than be a console player). Yay for PCs!
