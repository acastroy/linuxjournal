Don't be afraid of the cloud! Let Canonical and Amazon pick up the tab.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1736580.0x182e250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last year, I wrote an article on how to run Ubuntu 9.10 in the
Amazon Elastic Cloud (<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, May 2010). 
But, the folks over
at Canonical haven't been sitting on their laurels during the past year. They're so proud of the work they've done on their latest release,
10.10 Maverick Meerkat, they're offering a free 55-minute trial of
it in Amazon's EC2 cloud. The best part is you don't need an Amazon
EC2 account or a credit card. The wizards at Canonical have tied this
in to their Launchpad software collaboration platform, so all you need
is an account on launchpad.net to &ldquo;get your cloud on&rdquo;.
</p><p>
What you get for your 55 minutes is actually a fairly nice demo
package. Your cloud instance consists of the equivalent of a 1.2GHz
processor, 2GB of RAM, 160GB of disk space, full sudo-enabled root
access and a fast local connection to the Ubuntu mirrors. The Ubuntu
folks even provide a few preconfigured applications from which to choose,
like WordPress, MoinMoin or Drupal 7. The really great part about this
setup is that it renders most of my previous article obsolete&mdash;it's
really easy to set up and launch your instance.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1736580.0x182e568"></a>
Getting Started in the Cloud</h2></div></div><p>
Before you log in to the &ldquo;Ubuntu in the Cloud&rdquo; Web site, you should generate
a set of SSH keys on the client (or set of clients) you'll use to
administer the cloud instance, and upload those to your account on
launchpad.net. This is a prerequisite, because Amazon EC2 generally 
allows SSH access only via SSH keys. If you already have a launchpad.net
account, it's easy to do. Just go to your account page, click on SSH
Keys, then click on the green plus icon to add a new SSH key.
Then, paste your key in the field. If you've never generated any SSH keys
before, there's a great tutorial on the Ubuntu Wiki (see Resources).
If you don't have an account on
launchpad.net, you should. It's where you can file bugs and enhancements
to Ubuntu and other projects, and it's easy to register for one.
</p><p>
Once you've uploaded an SSH key to launchpad.net, point your Web browser
at the &ldquo;Ubuntu in the Cloud&rdquo; link (see Resources), and click the
Try Ubuntu 10.10 button. You'll be prompted to enter your launchpad.net
credentials if you're not already signed into Launchpad. Once your
credentials are accepted, you'll see the options for your free EC2
instance. Select what you'd like to try (Base install, WordPress,
MoinMoin or Drupal) and whether to use byobu (a screen-based
terminal wrapper&mdash;I highly recommend it). After that, just agree to
the Terms of Service, and click the big orange Launch button to start
your instance. You'll see an Ubuntu logo with a little status indicator
blinking away while the instance is built.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10941f1.large.jpg"><img src="10941f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Launching Your EC2 Demo Instance
</p></div></div><p>
When the instance is ready for use, you'll see a countdown clock in your
browser with the remaining time and the IP address of your
instance. You can SSH in to your instance by logging in as
&ldquo;ubuntu@&lt;ip
address&gt;&rdquo;, or if you selected one of the preloaded software
packages,
like WordPress, the Web page will display a link you can use to
get to the admin interface of your package.

Figure 2. How to Access Your EC2 Demo Instance
</p></div></div><p>
Now that your instance is on its feet, you can do anything you'd
do with an Internet-connected Ubuntu server&mdash;so long as you are done
within an hour. You can configure it as a Web server, play around with
LDAP, make it a mail server, or even fire up a honeypot (so long as
you're done with it in an hour). Anything you can
<tt  >apt-get</tt> in Ubuntu,
you can install in this server, so play with things like Apache, Squid
or whatever servers you like. This is a full Ubuntu installation in
Amazon's data center, so be sure to test-drive it!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10941f3.large.jpg"><img src="10941f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

byobu at the top of the window.
</p></div></div><p>
The preconfigured software is pretty good as well. In this case, when
I provisioned the instance, I selected the WordPress option, and I
was pleasantly surprised to see WordPress ready to go. All I had to do
was click the URL presented by the Web page once the instance was ready
and answer a few WordPress-specific questions like &ldquo;What do you want
the site name to be?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What's the admin password for your WordPress
site?&rdquo; I literally had posted my first blog post to the instance within
a couple minutes of it being live.

Figure 4. WordPress is live! Easiest installation I've ever done.
</p></div></div><p>
As your hour winds down, if you're SSH'd to the instance, you'll get a
&ldquo;wall&rdquo; message ten minutes before your hour is up, another when there
are five minutes remaining, and a final message at the one-minute
mark. Once your time is up, the instance &ldquo;powers off&rdquo;, and the Amazon
cloud automagically cleans up and deletes your instance, as well as any
data you put there, so make sure you're not putting anything important
there. It truly is a demo service.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10941f5.large.jpg"><img src="10941f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Oh no! I'm melting&mdash;my EC2 instance, shutting down and

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1736580.0x182f3d8"></a>
Okay, I like this. But it's gone in an hour, and I want
more.</h2></div></div><p>
So, you've played with your server, installed other software,
and monkeyed around with the preconfigured stuff on your
server. You're hooked and want your own server, but you don't want
to pay the full instance price of approximately $70 a month to run a
server full-time. Not to worry! Amazon has you covered. It now offers a
completely free &ldquo;micro&rdquo; server, called the AWS Free Usage Tier, just
for new users. The micro instance isn't quite as powerful as the free
test-drive server, but it's absolutely serviceable for a blog, mail server
or other light-duty application. Another possible (and very useful)
application would be an off-site Nagios or other monitoring instance.
See Table 1 for a comparison of the free test-drive instance vs. the micro server.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x1736580.0x182f590"></a><p class="title"><b>
Table 1. Free Test-Drive Instance vs. Free Micro Instance</b></p><table     summary="&#10;Table 1.

Unlike the free test-drive server (which is only 32-bit), the micro
instance can be either 32-bit or 64-bit, though the low RAM of the system
doesn't really make that distinction very useful. The Free Usage Tier
includes some other useful services as well, measured on a monthly basis:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
750 hours of EC2 running Linux/UNIX on a micro instance (this is the server
mentioned above).
</p></li><li><p>
750 hours of elastic load balancing plus 15GB data processing (in other
words, you can load-balance between servers, if you've spun up another
instance, but you'd pay for that second instance).
</p></li><li><p>
10GB of elastic block storage (includes one million IOs, 1GB of snapshot
storage, 10,000 snapshot get requests and 1,000 snapshot put requests).
</p></li><li><p>
15GB of inward bandwidth and 15GB of outward bandwidth aggregated across
all AWS services.
</p></li><li><p>
5GB of Amazon S3 storage, 20,000 get requests and 2,000 put requests.
</p></li><li><p>
25 Amazon SimpleDB Machine hours and 1GB of storage.
</p></li><li><p>
100,000 requests of Amazon Simple Queue Service.
</p></li><li><p>
100,000 requests, 100,000 HTTP notifications and 1,000 e-mail notifications
for Amazon Simple Notification Service.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The service does require a credit card to get started, but you're billed only
if you exceed the usage outlined above. It's a great way to
start learning how cloud services work and what they can do for you.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1736580.0x1c285f8"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
If you've never tried any cloud services before, or if you've been leery
of giving your credit card to a provider, try the free Ubuntu 10.10
server. It's a great way to dip your toe in the water at no cost to
you. Likewise, if you're familiar with the cloud, but you've not run
Ubuntu before, give this test-drive a shot. You'll get enough time with
Ubuntu to decide whether you want to pursue it further, but you won't have
to take the time to spin up a machine of your own. Just let Canonical
pick up the tab for the demo.
</p><p>
Once you've made up your mind as to whether the cloud is for you, take
a look at the new AWS Free Usage Tier. For a personal server, sandbox
or off-site monitor, the micro instance is up to
the challenge, and the price definitely can't be beat.
