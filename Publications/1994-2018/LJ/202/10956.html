Some of you may argue that all desktops eventually will be on tiny screens in
your pockets. To be honest, however, I like my 26" screen, and my pockets
aren't nearly big enough to hold it. So, although the embedded market 
certainly is important, this month we're focusing on the desktop&mdash;or
laptop,
if that's how you roll.
</p><p>
Charles Olsen gives a glimpse at GNOME 3, which isn't quite ready yet,
but it offers some significant changes you might want to read about.
Following his article, Shawn Powers (hey, that's me!) gives an overview of
the other desktop environments&mdash;possibly some you've never heard of, but
many you might want to try. Sometimes you want a faster desktop, and
sometimes you just want to be different from the crowd. Both are reasons to
check out the available options.
</p><p>
Having a desktop is only the start, of course. The real work is what you
do while using that desktop. Stuart Jarvis helps keep things organized
with Nepomuk. Most operating systems index files for quicker searching,
but Nepomuk goes one step further and integrates the process into KDE.
Although I still don't suggest saving everything to your desktop folder, if
that's how you do things, Nepomuk might keep you organized
despite yourself. If organization is something you prefer to do manually,
that's fine as well. One frustration with that scenario, however, is when
you move from computer to computer. Rather than organize each computer you
use, why not just take your desktop with you? Rick Rogers shows
how to create your own portable Linux desktop you can take with you
wherever you go.
</p><p>
This month, we've included plenty of useful
productivity information as well. Adam Pigg shows how to use the
KOffice database tool, Kexi. Databases may not be the most exciting
thing you'll deal with in a day, but they often pay the bills. Rather than using a
separate proprietary database format, Kexi relies on SQLite for its
underlying database program. That means any program able to deal with
SQLite can deal with Kexi databases. It's great to see a program support
standards, and Adam explains the ins and outs of using Kexi.
</p><p>
Bill Childers has his head in the clouds again this month and shows off
the free 55-minute trial of Amazon's EC2 available for Ubuntu 10.10 users.
Granted, 55 minutes isn't very long, but it's enough to give you a taste of the
cloud with no commitment. If you discover you like EC2, but don't want to
pay the monthly bill, be sure to read Bill's article. He has a solution
for that as well. What he doesn't have a solution for, however, is the
argument he and Kyle Rankin have about tablet computing. Whether you
think tablets are the next logical step to a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Trek</em></span> world, or just 
laptops that really could use keyboards, Bill and Kyle both have good
points. Perhaps I'll have to get a tablet myself&mdash;you know, for research.
</p><p>
We also have
our regular lineup of columns, like Reuven Lerner's HTML5 discussion and
Dave Taylor's help in dealing with spaces in filenames. Kyle Rankin
shows how to get pop-up notifications in your terminal windows, and John
Knight explores cool new programs that are fresh from the labs.
</p><p>
Additionally, we have a review by yours truly of the Giada N20, a sleek
little ION2-based
Nettop, and Mike Diehl shows off Jolicloud. We've also got info on Opengear's
new cellular router and a book on making LEGO guns. It's truly a fun
issue. So,
whether you think desktop computing is on its way out, or if you have a wall
of 30" monitors you refuse to give up, this issue has something for you.
As for me, I'm going to keep my phone in my pocket and my 26" monitor on
my desk. Even with my SCOTTEVEST jacket, toting around a giant monitor
doesn't sound like fun. I'll leave that chore for Bill and his tablet
computer.
