LSI's Engenio 2600-HD High-Density Storage System</h2></div></div><p>
If you're using the Lustre FS on your HPC system, you might be able to
improve your performance with LSI Corporation's new Engenio 2600-HD, a
high-density storage system that delivers a reported 40GB/s of throughput
and scaling to 1.8 PB of capacity in a single standard rack. LSI says
that Engenio's 2600-HD's highly scalable, dense architecture helps HPC
organizations maximize productivity and achieve a quicker time to results,
while minimizing data-center floor space and overall energy consumption.
The system consists of two LSI 6Gb/s SAS-based controllers integrated
into the new Engenio DE6600 high-density SAS drive enclosure. The system
is capable of sustaining up to 4GB/s of throughput and housing up to 60
SAS drives in a 4U space.

Wolfram Research's Mathematica</h2></div></div><p>
Mathematica from Wolfram Research, a favorite tool of Linux-geek
number-crunchers everywhere, recently crossed the magic threshold of
version 8. The new version 8 of this powerful computation, development
and deployment platform adds free-form linguistic input via its novel
Wolfram|Alpha technology, which enables users to input plain English and
get immediate results without the need for syntax. Among the other 500
new additions are improved capabilities for statistical distributions and
data visualization, built-in GPU programming support, SymbolicC support,
integrated control systems, wavelets functions, option pricing solvers
and feature detection in image processing. Mathematica 8 is available
for Linux x86, Mac OS X and Windows XP/Vista/7.

Martin H&uuml;depohl's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Badass LEGO Guns</em></span> (No Starch Press)</h2></div></div><p>
With a title like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Badass LEGO Guns</em></span>, how can you not judge a book by
its cover? This fun new book by Martin H&uuml;depohl and published by No
Starch Press illustrates how to build five eclectic weapons entirely
from LEGO Technic parts that can shoot plastic LEGO bricks at high
speed with a high level of accuracy. The builder adds only rubber bands,
some sanding and a touch of Krazy Glue to build these functional
<span   class="emphasis"><em>fusils</em></span>, each with its own kick-butt nickname:
the Warbeast submachine gun, the Thriller and Mini-Thriller crossbows,
the Parabella mini-marvel and the Lilliputt semi-automatic pistol with a
nine-brick magazine. The models range from sophisticated to simple, and
&ldquo;builders of all ages will find something enjoyable&rdquo;, notes the publisher.

R. B. Thompson and B. F. Thompson's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Building the Perfect
PC</em></span>, 3rd ed. (O'Reilly
Media)</h2></div></div><p>
Robert Bruce Thompson and Barbara Fritchman Thompson, authors of the
new 3rd edition of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Building the Perfect PC</em></span>, say you don't even
need to be a geek to build your own PC. Well, we <span   class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> geeks and we want to build our own PCs too. As talented
as we are though, we may want to pick up the Thompson team's updated
book to make sure we don't blow it. The payoff is a PC that is of higher
quality and lower cost than off-the-shelf models. The authors explain
what components you'll need as well as where to find them. They also
explain how to build for your OS of choice and take advantage of the
latest multicore CPUs. Instructions cover how to build numerous types
of PCs, including a general-purpose computer, an extreme gaming machine,
a media center, an appliance, a low-cost PC or a home server.

TYAN's AMD FireStream GPU Compute Accelerators</h2></div></div><p>
Four new lines of server platform are now available from TYAN, all of
which are designed to take full advantage of AMD FireStream GPU compute
accelerators. These compute accelerators deliver what TYAN labels
&ldquo;shocking floating-point performance that is exponentially faster than
x86 CPUs in some applications&rdquo;. The solutions&mdash;models B7015, S7025,
S8225 and S8236&mdash;range from one AMD FireStream compute accelerator in
a 1U server up to eight compute accelerators in a 4U platform. These
platforms feature double-wide PCIe 2.0 x16 slots, and they meet the special
mechanical requirements as well as the power and airflow needs to support
AMD FireStream 9170, 9250, 9270, 9350 and 9370 GPU compute accelerators.

QA Graphics' Energy Efficiency Education Dashboard</h2></div></div><p>
As the old adage goes, you can't manage what you don't measure. And if
managing resource (such as electricity, water and so on) use or production
is your goal, QA Graphics' Energy Efficiency Education Dashboard
(EEED), just upgraded to version 2.0, may be the tool for the job.
EEED is an interactive solution that displays real-time building data
and educates occupants on sustainable building-management practices.
The new version is a fully encapsulated application based on the
Adobe AIR platform that runs as a standalone client or software as a
service with no browser constraints. The solution often is used by
organizations to help earn points toward green-building-certification
programs, such as US Green Building Council's LEED and the Green
Building Initiative's Green Globes.
