How do you deal with this problem in your scripts?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c84580.0x1d7c3b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the good old days when UNIX was young, no one ever would have thought of
putting a space in a filename. It simply wasn't done&mdash;just as you'd never
do that on a DOS or Windows system. Filenames were short, succinct and
well-formed, like HW43.DOC.
</p><p>
Most of the Linux command-line utilities and the shells themselves have been
designed based on the premise that a space delimits a field value rather than
being an acceptable component of a filename. If you've done any scripting,
you already know this. Spaces in filenames can cause great trouble in shell
scripts!
Here's a simple example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for name in $(ls | grep a)
do
  echo "File #$count = $name"
  count=$(( $count + 1 ))
done
</pre>
</p><p>
To set the stage, I've created a directory with some tricky filenames:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls
"quoted" beastly filename      sample2.txt
multi-word file name.pdf           test.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
Yes, to maximize trouble, I have a filename that includes quotes as well as a
space. Don't get me started on having an escape character or non-printable
character in the name though. It's doable, but I'd rename it as soon as
possible.
</p><p>
Not all the filenames above have an &ldquo;a&rdquo; in them, so let's see what
happens when the fragmentary script is run in this directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./test.sh
File # = "quoted"
File #1 = beastly
File #2 = filename
File #3 = multi-word
File #4 = file
File #5 = name.pdf
File #6 = sample2.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
Oh, is that ugly and wrong!
</p><p>
The shell can deal with these filenames if they're simple enough, and the for
loop <tt  >for name in *a*</tt> yields three filenames, not six, but somewhere
along your scripting journey, you inevitably will slam into the problem of
embedded spaces.
</p><p>
The most common error is to forget to quote filenames when you use them
elsewhere in the script, of course. As an example, let's work on a script
that replaces spaces in filenames with underscores.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c84580.0x1d7c9e0"></a>
File Renaming with a Bug</h2></div></div><p>
The obvious solution to such renaming is something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for name in "* *"
do
  newname="$(echo $name | sed 's/ /_/g')"
  mv $name $newname
done
</pre>
</p><p>
This doesn't work, however, and in a most fascinating way:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mv "quoted" beastly filename multi-word file 
 &#8618;name.pdf sample2.txt test.sh "quoted" 
 &#8618;beastly filename multi-word file 
 &#8618;name.pdf sample2.txt test.sh 
&#8618;"quoted"_beastly_filename_multi-word_file_
&#8618;name.pdf_sample2.txt_test.sh_"quoted"_beastly_
&#8618;filename_multi-word_file_name.pdf_sample2.txt_test.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
What's happened is that <tt  >"* *"</tt> simply produces two full filename
listings rather than just those filenames that contain a space&mdash;oops. Let's
try a different pattern: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
for name in *\ *
</pre>
</p><p>
That does the trick, but we've not compensated for the fact that when the
shell sees a line like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mv multi-word file name.pdf multi-word_file_name.pdf
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c84580.0x1d7cda8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
it's going to complain that it's seeing four filename arguments to the
<tt  >mv</tt> command, not the required two:

<pre     class="programlisting">
usage: mv [-f | -i | -n] [-v] source target
       mv [-f | -i | -n] [-v] source ... directory
</pre>
</p><p>
In this case, the solution is to quote the filename variable:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mv "$name" $newname
</pre>
</p><p>
As a discipline, it's always good to quote filenames you reference in any
context to ensure that when the shell passes them to the command as arguments,
the filenames with embedded spaces are handled properly.
</p><p>
This isn't a universal solution, however, because if you're using
subshells and pipes, it can be pretty darn hard for quotes to survive multiple
steps.
</p><p>
One path to travel is to set IFS, the internal field separator, in the
shell to something other than a space, as explained in the Bash man page:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
IFS: The Internal Field Separator that is used for word splitting after
expansion and to split lines into words with the read built-in command. The
default value is &ldquo;&lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;new-line&gt;&rdquo;.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
That's useful for &ldquo;read&rdquo;, particularly if you're reading lines
of text and want to have a different field separator (think flat-file text
database files), but it still doesn't really solve our filename problem.
</p><p>
One thing I've used in the past, although it's a sloppy, crude solution,
is to start by changing spaces to some unlikely sequence of characters, run
through all the processing, and change them back at the last second. For
example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
safename="$(echo name | sed 's/ /_-_/g')"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c84580.0x1d7d3d8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and reversed with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
original="$(echo $safename | sed s'/_-_/ /g')"
</pre>
</p><p>
It solves the problem, but it's definitely not a very efficient or smart use
of computing resources.
</p><p>
I've outlined three possible solution paths herein: modifying the IFS value,
ensuring that you always quote filenames where referenced, and rewriting
filenames internally to replace spaces with unlikely character sequences,
reversing it on your way out of the script.
</p><p>
By the way, have you ever tried using the find|xargs pair with filenames that have
spaces? It's sufficiently complicated that modern versions of these two
commands have special arguments to denote that spaces might appear as part of
the filenames: <tt  >find -print</tt> and <tt  >xargs
-0</tt> (and typically,
they're not the same flags, but that's another story).
</p><p>
During the years I've been writing this column, I've more than once tripped up
on this particular problem and received e-mail messages from readers sharing how a sample
script tosses up its bits when a file with a space in its name appears.
They're right.
</p><p>
My defensive reaction is &ldquo;dude, don't use spaces in filenames&rdquo;, but
that's not really a good long-term solution, is it? 
</p><p>
What I'd like to do instead is open this up for discussion on the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> discussion boards: how do you solve this problem within your scripts?
Or, do you just religiously avoid using spaces in your filenames?
