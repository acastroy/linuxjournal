If you live in screen, learn how to make its status bar notify you like a
pop-up window on a desktop.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24ec580.0x25e4408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you have used the command line for any length of time, someone probably has introduced you to a program named screen. If you
aren't familiar with it, screen allows you to manage multiple console
sessions within the same program, so instead of dealing with tabs or
multiple terminal windows, you can shift between your console sessions
with a few key-presses. In addition to this, screen allows you
to detach from these console sessions completely while they are still
running and then reattach to them later. One use for this could be to
start a process that might take some time near the end of the day at
work within a screen session, detach from the session, then reattach
later on that evening at home to make sure it completed.
</p><p>
I use screen along with Irssi on a server I leave running, so I can
stay logged in to IRC at all times and just attach to that screen session
from any machine I happen to be using. I also keep other console
sessions in screen set up for mutt and SSH instances into various servers,
so I can access everything from the same session. To be honest, I spend
a majority of time in front of a computer within screen sessions.
</p><p>
Because I devote so much of my focus to a screen window, I've found it
handy to take advantage of the status line within screen to notify me of
anything that might need my attention. The status line often is off by
default; however, once enabled, it takes up a row at the bottom of your
console. You can configure it to list all sorts of information, from things
as basic as the current date and time to as complicated as the output
of any shell program you can imagine.
</p><p>
Configuring the status line in screen quickly can become quite
complicated. There is a robust syntax of string escapes that allows
you to control right and left justification and coloration of all
the items in the status line. Special string escapes also allow you to
specify the current time, the hostname and system load. Describing all
these options is much like describing printf syntax to someone for the
first time. Instead of going into all of that here, I refer you to the
section of the screen man page titled STRING ESCAPES. To get there, 
type <tt  >man screen</tt>, and once you are in the man page,
type <tt  >/^STRING ESCAPES</tt>,
and press Enter.
</p><p>
For this column, I show how to enable the status line
in screen and tweak it so it shows you some basic system
information. Finally, I explain how to add custom script output. If you
decide you want to have fancy colorized status lines, I'm sure you'll
have fun experimenting with all of the options in the man page.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24ec580.0x25e4880"></a>
Enable the Status Line</h2></div></div><p>
Each user's individual screen settings are configured in ~/.screenrc,
so to enable a basic status line, you use the hardstatus configuration
option. To create a status line that says &ldquo;hello world&rdquo;, add the following
lines to your ~/.screenrc:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hardstatus alwayslastline
hardstatus string 'hello world'
</pre>
</p><p>
Now when you start screen, you should see &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; along the bottom
of your window in reverse video (that is, your foreground and background
colors will be reversed). Some people like that, but if you want to
have white text instead, change the hardstatus string to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hardstatus string '%{= w}hello world'
</pre>
</p><p>
The next time you load your screen session, the text will be white. If you
want, you also can change the .screenrc from within the screen session
itself and reload it. Once you have saved any changes to your .screenrc,
just press Ctrl-a : (that's Ctrl-a followed by the : key), then type
<tt  >source ~/.screenrc</tt>, and press Enter.
</p><p>
Since the status line works now, let's make it display more useful
information, like the current date and time, and system load. Change your
hardstatus string to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hardstatus string '%{= w}%Y-%m-%d %c | %l'
</pre>
</p><p>
This looks a bit complicated, but let's break it down. The <tt  >%{=
w}</tt> part of
the screen sets the foreground to white. I can represent the year, month
and day with <tt  >%Y</tt>, <tt  >%m</tt> and
<tt  >%d</tt>, respectively, and in this case, I added a hyphen
(-) in
between each value so it was easier to read. Then, I added a space and
<tt  >%c</tt>,
which is expanded into the current time. Finally, I added a | symbol with
some spaces for padding and <tt  >%l</tt>, which expands out into the current load.

Custom Status Scripts</h2></div></div><p>
As you can see in my example, screen provides a few string escapes
for some common output you might want in the status line. It also
allows you to define custom commands it can run and display the output
on the status line instead. All you have to do is define a command in
your .screenrc via the backtick option, and then reference that command
in the hardstatus string. For instance, here's a simple Perl script I
wrote that parses the output of <tt  >fetchmail -c</tt> (which checks an IMAP
account of mine for new messages). If any of my defined folders have
new messages, it outputs them separated by spaces. Name the following
script /usr/local/bin/new_mail_check.pl:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/perl

open FETCHMAIL, "/usr/bin/fetchmail -t 10 -c 2&gt;/dev/null |" 
 &#8618;or die "Can't run fetchmail: $!
\n";

while(&lt;FETCHMAIL&gt;){
   if(/^(\d+) messages \((\d+) seen.*?folder (.*?)\)/){
      $m+=$1; $s+=$2; $f=$3;
# you might have to change this regex depending on 
# how your IMAP server displays subfolders
      $f =~ s/INBOX\.//;
   }
   if($1 &gt; $2){
      $fs{$f} = $1 - $2;
   }
}
close FETCHMAIL;
$t = $m - $s;

if($t &gt; 0){
   foreach $folder (sort { $fs{$a}&lt;=&gt;$fs{$b} } keys %fs){
      push @folders, "$folder:$fs{$folder}";
   }
}
print join " ", @folders;
</pre>
</p><p>
Make sure the script is executable, then change your ~/.screenrc to
the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
backtick 101 60 60 /usr/local/bin/new_mail_check.pl
hardstatus alwayslastline
hardstatus string '%{= w}%Y-%m-%d %c | %l | %101`'
</pre>
</p><p>
The first line defines a backtick command that will be referred to as
101. The two 60s that follow define the life span and auto-refresh times for
the command in seconds. The lifespan is defined as the number of seconds
the output is considered valid before the command will be run again if
the string escape is encountered. The auto-refresh value defines when
to refresh the display of the hardstatus string. I usually define both
values to be the same for my backtick commands. In this case, I check for
new mail every 60 seconds. The final argument in the command is the full
path to the command you want to run. If you need to specify any arguments,
you can put them after the command. Also notice that I added
<tt  >%101`</tt> to the
end of my hardstatus string. The <tt  >%`</tt> string escape will put the specified
backtick output into the status. In this case, <tt  >%101`</tt> will put the output of
the backtick command I define as 101. If I wanted to add another command,
I'd add another backtick line to my .screenrc and define it as
102.

</p></div></div><p>
So, where do you go from here? Well, besides using all the string
escapes to colorize your status lines, you really are limited only by
your shell scripting ability. For instance, there's a program for Irssi
called fnotify you can use to log everyone who highlights your
handle in Irssi into a file. I wrote a simple script to pull the last
line from that file, parse it, and display the date and handle of the
last person who talked to me on IRC to my status bar. You also could 
write scripts to show you information from Twitter, headlines from your
favorite sites, Nagios alert summaries or even random output from the
fortune command. If you are like me though, you'll spend the bulk of
your time tweaking all the colors and left and right padding, so 
your status looks just right.
