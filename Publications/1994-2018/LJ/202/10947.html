What's in store when the GNOME Project finally releases GNOME 3,
and what will Canonical choose for the new Ubuntu?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fa0580.0x20982a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Linux is great for people who like having choices. For example, if
you want to use a graphical desktop, there are many from which to choose, 
including XFCE, LXDE, Fluxbox, Openbox and Enlightenment, not to mention the two
most popular desktops, GNOME and KDE. See Shawn Powers' article for more
information on other desktop options (page 48).
</p><p>
KDE version 4.0 was released in January 2008, but GNOME hasn't had a
major version update since 2.0 was released in 2002. 
Quite a few incremental updates have been made to GNOME, and until
recently, the GNOME
Project had planned to release version 3.0 in September 2010. At the time
of this
writing, the release has been pushed to March 2011.
</p><p>
When KDE 4.0 was released, it was a major change from KDE 3.5. Although
KDE 4.0 was labeled a stable release, it actually was intended for
developers and early adopters. Much of the functionality from KDE 3.5
had not yet been re-implemented. KDE 4.0 felt like a huge step
backward, and it was widely criticized as being incomplete. GNOME 3's
delayed release may be an attempt to avoid a similar situation.
</p><p>
When I started using Linux, I came from the world of Windows and
preferred the KDE desktop because it seemed more familiar. I initially
was excited to see the new KDE 4.0. But after the upgrade, I soon became
disgusted with the mess I now had on my system. So I installed GNOME
and was quite happy with it. Not only did it <span   class="emphasis"><em>work</em></span>, but
also my PC ran faster with GNOME than it did with KDE 4.0.
</p><p>
I haven't completely ignored KDE 4 since then. I've occasionally
installed it on a test system and tried it out. KDE 4.1 seemed
generally usable, and by the time 4.4 was released, it actually seemed
pretty good. But for my production systems, I've stuck with GNOME and
have been quite happy with it.
</p><p>
Now, GNOME is close to releasing a major upgrade to GNOME 3, which
uses GNOME Shell to display the application windows and other
objects. Will this be another fiasco like KDE 4? I don't think
so. Based on what I've seen so far, I think GNOME 3 will be a solid
release.
</p><p>
But, that's not all that's coming. Canonical is charting its own
path and developing a different desktop called Unity for its next
version of Ubuntu. Unity is already Canonical's desktop for Netbooks&mdash;is
it suitable for laptops and PCs? 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fa0580.0x2098720"></a>
GNOME 3</h2></div></div><p>
Although it has not been released officially, GNOME Shell has been in
the repositories for a while now. You can install it and get a preview
of what's coming in GNOME 3.
</p><p>
According to the GNOME Project Web site, &ldquo;Our goal in designing GNOME
Shell is to provide a consistent, self-teaching user interface based
around the day-to-day tasks of the user.&rdquo; Let's take a look and see
how GNOME plans to accomplish that.
</p><p>
Instead of the two panels in GNOME 2, GNOME Shell has a single panel
at the top of the screen. It contains some of the items you're
familiar with, such as the clock and notification icons. But instead
of the three menus, now there's a single button named
Activities. Next to the Activities button is the name of the currently
running application. This eventually will contain the application menu
and options, such as close, open a new window and options specific to
that application.
</p><p>
When you click the Activities button, the full screen switches to the
Activities overview mode. You also can invoke the Activities overview
by pressing the Super key on the keyboard, or Alt-F1, or just by moving
the mouse pointer to the upper-left corner of the screen. I hope GNOME
offers an option to disable that last choice, because I found it way
too easy to activate the overview unintentionally while working on my
laptop.
</p><p>
The Activities overview takes the full screen, and it shows all the ways
that users can switch from doing one activity to another. It
displays a preview of all the windows that are open, on all the
workspaces in use. It also shows a list of favorite applications,
applications currently running, places (favorite directories and
connected devices), and the 20 most recently used documents. There's
also a Search box at the top left; if what you're looking for isn't
immediately visible, simply start typing part of the application name or
description.
</p><p>
I love workspaces. I tend to leave a lot of applications open as I
switch from one task to the next, and it's nice to be able to group
the windows into a workspace so I can look only at the programs
I'm currently using.
</p><p>
GNOME Shell lets you create workspaces as needed. When you're in the
Activities overview, you'll see a small plus sign at the lower
right. Click the plus sign to create a new, empty workspace. While
still in the overview, you then can drag windows from the other
workspaces into the new workspace. Drag an application icon into a
workspace to launch the program in that workspace. You also can create
a new workspace and launch a program in that workspace by dragging the
application icon onto the new workspace plus sign icon.

Figure 1. The GNOME Shell Activities Overview with Four Workspaces
</p></div></div><p>
In GNOME 2, switching to a running application in another workspace
often meant switching to the appropriate workspace, then selecting the
program you want. In GNOME Shell, the Activities overview shows all
workspaces and previews of all windows in each workspace. I can go
directly to the workspace and application simply by clicking the
window in the overview.
</p><p>
Pressing Alt-Tab displays all applications that are open, even if they're not
in the currently selected workspace. A vertical separator bar
separates the programs in the current workspace from those in other
workspaces. You can select any program in the traditional way, by
pressing the Tab key and releasing Alt when you get to the desired
application, or you can use the mouse to click the application you want.
</p><p>
A new function that is not implemented yet is that Alt-` (the key above
the Tab key on US-layout keyboards) will switch between windows of the
same application. Some applications do this now with Ctrl-F6, but that
takes two hands and is not consistent across all applications. Using
Alt-` will be much easier and feel more natural. 
</p><p>
As you use Alt-Tab to cycle through open programs, programs with
multiple windows open will be grouped in one icon. If you pause while
that icon is highlighted, a preview of the open windows will appear
below the icon. You also can get the preview immediately by pressing
the down-arrow key. You then can select the specific window by using
the left- and right-arrow keys.
</p><p>
Customizing your favorite applications is easy. Use the Search box to
find the application you want to add, then simply right-click the icon
and choose Add to Favorites. To remove favorites you don't need,
right-click the icon and choose Remove from Favorites.
</p><p>
The Places section of the Activities overview shows the items in the
Places section in Nautilus. Simply add or remove items in Nautilus to
customize the Places in your Activities overview. 
</p><p>
The plan is that GNOME Shell will put a bigger emphasis on
applications than the separate windows of the application. When
you switch to the Activities overview, applications with multiple
windows open will be represented by a single icon. In GNOME 2, you see
an icon in the panel for each open window, and sometimes you have to
guess which is the window you want.
</p><p>
In GNOME Shell, you can right-click on the application icon to see a
list of open windows. You can select the specific window you want or
open a new window. This wasn't working properly in the GNOME Shell I
was running, so I wasn't able to test it.
</p><p>
The Search box will search not only application names and
descriptions, but also through the names of recent documents and
system customization commands.
</p><p>
When you're in the Activities overview with the small window previews,
you can zoom the preview of a particular window without selecting it
by pointing to it with the mouse and rolling the mouse scroll wheel
upward. Scroll down with the wheel to zoom back out.
</p><p>
Several of the functions still work the way you're used to from
GNOME 2. Alt-F2 still brings up a command line where you can enter a
single command. The Esc key will escape from anything, such as the
Activities overview, the Search within the overview, and the Alt-F2
command line. You still can switch to a different workspace using
Ctrl-Alt-Right or Ctrl-Alt-Left, and you can move the current window
to another workspace by pressing Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Right and
Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Left. 
</p><p>
GNOME Shell offers a new way to look at your desktop and activities,
without making a radical break from the previous version on GNOME.

Unity</h2></div></div><p>
It would seem ideal for Ubuntu's April 2011 release to include GNOME
3. However, Mark Shuttleworth has announced that Canonical will be taking a
different direction and the next release of Ubuntu will feature Unity
as the desktop.
</p><p>
According to Shuttleworth, the Canonical folks spent quite a bit of time
analyzing screenshots of a couple hundred desktop configurations
from the current Ubuntu and Kubuntu user base to see what people used
most. They also wanted to identify things that were
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
needed in a lightweight environment. 
</p><p>
They found that most users have between three and ten application launchers
on the panel for quick access to their most-used programs. The new
interface would follow that example and make a few applications
instantly accessible, while still making it easy to get to everything
else. 
</p><p>
They also focused on getting the best use out of screen real
estate. Unity initially was designed for Netbooks, where the screens
were usually wide but not very tall. Now laptop and desktop monitors
are moving to more of a wide-screen format. They realized they
needed to be very conservative in using the vertical space.
</p><p>
Finally, they wanted the interface to be finger-friendly. Touchscreens are becoming more common, and Canonical wants Ubuntu to be
ready.
</p><p>
This research and these decisions were the basis of Unity in Ubuntu
Netbook Edition 10.10. And, according to Shuttleworth's announcement,
Unity will be the default desktop for future editions of Ubuntu.
</p><p>
Rather than the traditional panels at the top and bottom of the
screen, Unity conserves vertical real estate by moving the bottom
panel to the left side of the screen. This panel also is widened to
make it more touch-friendly. It will show a few icons for instant
access to selected applications, and it also will display icons for all
applications currently running. Programs currently
running are shown with a small indicator on the left side of the
icon. The application that has the focus has an additional indicator
on the right side. A single touch or click is all that is needed to
launch a favorite application or switch to another program that's
already running.
</p><p>
The three-menu design of traditional GNOME has been replaced with a
single global menu that you invoke by clicking a button on the left
panel. The titlebar, including the Close/Minimize/Maximize buttons of
the currently selected application, is rendered in the top panel.
</p><p>
When you open the global menu, the top panel displays a search
field and the following application categories: All Applications, Accessories,
Games, Internet, Media, Office and System. Initially, the All
Applications choice is selected, and the screen is a mess with the
icons for all installed applications on the display. 
</p><p>
You can narrow it down by choosing one of the categories, so that only
a few icons are displayed. Or, you can click the search field and type
part of the application's name or description. This displays not
only installed applications that match the search text, but also any
matching applications available in the repository. Click the icon of
the available program to launch Software Center with that application
already selected. If you want the app, just click the Install button.
</p><p>
The result of all this is a display that has saved a significant
amount of space and is optimized to use one application
at a time. This is how most people work; you may have other
applications running at the same time, but normally you interact with
one application at a time.

</p></div></div><p>
Unity is available now, in Ubuntu Netbook Edition and as a PPA you can
install in the Desktop Edition. (See sidebar for install
instructions.) Shuttleworth said, &ldquo;I'd very much like to get feedback
from people trying it out on a Netbook, or even a laptop with a wide
screen.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Not all of these features described here are fully implemented, but
they should be by the time Ubuntu 11.04 is released. Other things
seem unfinished too. I couldn't find a way to make any changes, for
example, to customize the launchers on the left panel. Presumably, this
will be corrected by the time it's released.
</p><p>
And, if you don't like Unity? Don't worry; you still can install
standard GNOME or one of the other desktops from the repository.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Both GNOME Shell and Unity are quite usable today in their current
forms. We're not going to see the kind of problems and uproar that
occurred when KDE 4 was released. The changes going into the creation
of GNOME Shell and even Unity are far less ambitious than the changes
that created KDE 4.
</p><p>
Unity also is a shell for GNOME, although it's completely separate from
GNOME Shell. Unity and Gnome Shell essentially are opposite ends of
the spectrum. Unity is designed for a simple environment where
people tend to do one thing at a time, and Gnome Shell is designed
for a more complex environment where users are doing multiple
activities simultaneously.
</p><p>
Personally, I really like GNOME Shell on a desktop or laptop PC. My
impression is that Unity will be a good choice for small touchscreens, but I'd rather have GNOME Shell or even GNOME 2 on a larger
display. 
</p><p>
But, that's just my preference. If you want something different, your
ideal setup is only a few clicks away.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fa0580.0x2099b10"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Try Them Yourself</b></p><p>
GNOME 3 and Unity are not ready for release, but you can get a preview
and see where the projects are at the moment. Because they are
unfinished, they are not recommended for use in a production
environment.
</p><p>
GNOME 3 is easy&mdash;just use the package manager to install
gnome-shell.
</p><p>
Once the package and dependencies have been installed, you can
activate it with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gnome-shell --replace
</pre>
</p><p>
To install Unity, you need to add a Personal Package Archive.
Open a terminal, and enter the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:canonical-dx-team/une
</pre>
</p><p>
Enter your password when prompted, and apt will add the PPA and import the key.
</p><p>
Then, update your software list:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get update
</pre>
</p><p>
To install Unity, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install unity
</pre>
</p><p>
Once Unity is installed, the next time you log in, the interface will
default to Ubuntu Netbook Edition. (Ubuntu Desktop Edition still
is available, of course.)
