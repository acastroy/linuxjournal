There's a new <span   class="bold"><b>dd</b></span> in town. Specifically,
it's <span   class="bold"><b>ddpt</b></span>, written by <span   class="bold"><b>Douglas
Gilbert</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>Mark Knibbs</b></span> and
others. The pt is short for pass through
and refers to the <span   class="bold"><b>SCSI pass through
interface</b></span> that ddpt specializes
in. Douglas announced the project and provided the URL: <a href="http://sg.danny.cz/sg/ddpt.html" target="_self">sg.danny.cz/sg/ddpt.html</a>. The original dd tool, on which ddpt
is based, is a low-level, super-powered data copier, designed (among
other things) to convert data between formats recognized on different
architectures.
</p><p>
For those of you who've been missing <span   class="bold"><b>Jon
Masters' kernel podcast</b></span>, it's
back! The feed is at <a href="http://podcasts.jonmasters.org/kernel/kernel.xml" target="_self">podcasts.jonmasters.org/kernel/kernel.xml</a>, and the
transcripts are at <a href="http://www.kernelpodcast.org" target="_self">www.kernelpodcast.org</a>. It's a tough
project, due to the psychotically high volume of mailing-list traffic
he needs to cover. He took a break a while back as an alternative to
burn-out, and he's now announced that he's back and going at it again.
Have fun this time around, Jon!

Linux is famous for its high uptimes. But, nowadays people want to
maximize resource usage by cramming lots of <span   class="bold"><b>KVM</b></span> instances onto a given
hardware system, and they want each virtual machine to have either a
high uptime or at least a quick recovery time. <span   class="bold"><b>Fernando Luis Vazquez
Cao</b></span> and other folks are trying to improve KVM's high-availability
powers by triggering a recovery event whenever a KVM instance goes
down. It's much more straightforward to do this for a virtual machine
than for an actual hardware computer. When a physical computer goes
down, it also might bring down whatever triggering mechanism is
supposed to start the recovery process. When a virtual machine goes
down, there's much less danger that the enclosing process might be
damaged, so the trigger always can be initiated.
</p><p>
There's a new <span   class="bold"><b>IRQ Subsystem maintainer</b></span>! Or
at least, it's the same
old guy, but now it's in the MAINTAINERS file. <span   class="bold"><b>Joe
Perches</b></span> recently
posted a patch listing <span   class="bold"><b>Thomas Gleixner</b></span> as the IRQ maintainer. This was
based on the fact that Thomas submits almost 50% of IRQ patches, while
the next highest contributor submitted only 13%. IRQs (interrupt
requests) are very quick responses to events on the system. They let
you keep browsing the Web while behind the scenes everything keeps
going on the way it's supposed to. And, now there's a maintainer for
all that.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Miklos Szeredi</b></span> announced a new <span   class="bold"><b>union filesystem</b></span> he'd been working on.
Union filesystems are neat, because if you have two different
filesystems with a similar directory structure, you can use a
union FS to overlay them both on top of each other so they appear to
be a single directory tree. File A in /home on one filesystem and
file B in /home on the other filesystem, for example, then
would appear to be files A and B in /home on a single unified filesystem.
There also are various interesting implementation problems, such as
what to do if both filesystems have a file A in /home. Which one does
the user see? Miklos' union filesystem would assign one filesystem to
be the &ldquo;upper&rdquo; one, and the other to be the
&ldquo;lower&rdquo; one. If any files were
duplicated across both filesystems, only the one in the
&ldquo;upper&rdquo;
filesystem would be visible to the user. <span   class="bold"><b>Neil
Brown</b></span> discussed this and
more in the documentation he contributed to the project, in response
to Miklos' announcement.

<h2 class="title">Focus on Writing: FocusWriter</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #202, February 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Because you're reading this in a magazine, it's fairly obvious I'm
a writer. What might not be obvious, however, is that I'm also easily
distrac&mdash;LOOK, A PONY! Seriously though, if you do any writing, you've
likely discovered that word processors weren't designed for people that
need to pump out a specific amount of text in a specific amount of time.
There a few features we don't need and really don't want:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Formatting, smart quotes, rich text.
</p></li><li><p>
Any format that is not plain text.
</p></li><li><p>
Photo insertion.
</p></li><li><p>
Automatic list formatting.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Those things are great if you're writing a paper for a college
professor, or if you're creating a proposal for purchases.
Unfortunately, what is a feature for some is a hindrance for others.
As a writer, features I want are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A running word count&mdash;in publishing, word count is king.
</p></li><li><p>
A full-screen mode to hide distractions&mdash;and ponies.
</p></li><li><p>
Autosave.
</p></li><li><p>
A standard and simple file/save interface.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
And really, that's it. They may seem like simple things, but
it's difficult to find software that meets the bill.
A few options are available, but by far, the most usable I've
found is FocusWriter. It has all the features I want, and it's small
and fast requiring very few libraries to install. My only complaint is
there's no option for keeping the menu on the screen. In order
to see the menu, you need to mouse-over the top of the window. Yes,
I know it's a feature, but it's a feature I'd like to turn off.
The flickering menu tends to distract me. You know, like a pony.

If you've ever taken notes in Linux, chances are you've at least tried
Tomboy. It's installed by default on most systems, and it's a rather
impressive application for jotting down quick notes. One of its newer
features is the ability to sync notes between computers. One of the
benefits of that feature is that the note-syncing works cross-platform!
Because there are native versions of Tomboy for both Windows and OS X,
syncing between Linux and non-Linux computers should be a breeze.
</p><p>
The syncing feature is relatively new to Tomboy, so it's possible you'll
run into a few snafus, but for cross-platform, open-source note-syncing,
it's worth the effort. Download installers for all three platforms at
<a href="http://projects.gnome.org/tomboy" target="_self">projects.gnome.org/tomboy</a>, although if you're running Linux,
it's probably already installed.

<h2 class="title">Maximum Theory with Maxima</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #202, February 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Last month, I explained using Scilab to analyze the results of an
experiment. In that specific case, I looked at a pendulum and
how it behaved with different lengths and weights. This month,
I cover using Maxima to help derive the equations describing
the motion of a pendulum.
</p><p>
Maxima is a calculating engine that runs on
the console, and several GUI front ends are available for it, such
as wxMaxima. Maxima and its GUIs should be available for your
distribution; if not, get the source code from the main Web site
(<a href="http://maxima.sourceforge.com" target="_self">maxima.sourceforge.com</a>).
</p><p>
To start Maxima on the command line, type
<tt  >maxima</tt>. You should see some licensing information
and then 
a prompt (Figure 1). To get a GUI, run <tt  >wxmaxima</tt>
(Figure 2). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10942maximaf1.large.jpg"><img src="10942maximaf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Maxima Prompt
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10942maximaf2.large.jpg"><img src="10942maximaf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. wxMaxima GUI
</p></div></div><p>
Maxima runs as a continuous session, much like Maple
or Mathematica. To end your session and exit the program,
execute the <tt  >quit();</tt> command. Notice that commands within
Maxima end with a semicolon. Anyone used to coding in C should be familiar
with this. If you end a command with a $ instead, the output from that
command won't be displayed.
</p><p>
Sometimes you may run a command in Maxima and not realize how long
it will take to finish. If it's taking too long, stop
execution by pressing Ctrl-C. Like in bash, Ctrl-C stops execution of the
currently running command. Because this is a forced stop, you'll get
an error message, but don't worry about following up on it, unless you suspect something
deeper is happening. 
</p><p>
Maxima also contains help files for all of its built-in
functions. To see detailed information about a function, 
type <tt  >? command</tt> to see a help page on the given command. For most
commands and functions, you'll also get some examples.
</p><p>
When you first start Maxima, the prompt is simply:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i1)
</pre>
</p><p>
Every input line is labeled in a similar fashion, with incrementing
numbers.
So after the first prompt, the following input prompts would be
<tt  >%i2</tt>, <tt  >%i3</tt>
and so on. The output from commands are displayed immediately following
the command, labeled with tags of the form <tt  >%o1</tt>,
<tt  >%o2</tt>, <tt  >%o3</tt>
and so on. These behave the same as variables in Maxima. This means 
you can refer to earlier commands or their results simply by using
the label. If you wanted to rerun the very first command you ran in
this session, simply execute <tt  >%i1;</tt>. There also are shortcuts for
the last command and the last result. For the last command, simply
type two single quotes (<tt  >''</tt>). For the last computed result, 
type a single percent sign (<tt  >%</tt>). The percent sign also marks special
built-in values&mdash;for example, %e (natural log base), %i (square root of
-1) or %pi (3.14159...).
</p><p>
Maxima can handle arithmetic very easily. The most common arithmetic
operations are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
+ &mdash; addition
</p></li><li><p>
- &mdash; subtraction
</p></li><li><p>
* &mdash; scalar multiplication
</p></li><li><p>
/ &mdash; division
</p></li><li><p>
^ or ** &mdash; exponentiation
</p></li><li><p>
. &mdash; matrix multiplication
</p></li><li><p>
sqrt(x) &mdash; square root of x
</p></li></ul></div><p>
You can apply these to both numbers and variables. Arithmetic is done
exactly, whenever possible. This means things like fractions are
kept as fractions until you explicitly ask for a numeric result. So you
see behavior like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i1) 1/100 + 1/101;
(%o2)             201
                 -----
                 10100
</pre>
</p><p>
Variables are easy to use in Maxima. They simply are alphanumeric
strings. Use the colon character to assign a value to a variable.
For example, if you want to find the square of a number,
use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i1) x: 2;
(%o1)             2
(%i2) x^2;
(%o2)             4
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can assign more complex functions to a variable&mdash;for example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i3) w: sin(0.5 * %pi);
(%o3)            sin(0.5 %pi)
(%i4) w^2;
(%o4)            sin^2(0.5 %pi)
</pre>
</p><p>
In certain cases, Maxima leaves results in a partly computed state. If
you want to force Maxima to give you a number, add <tt  >,
numer</tt>
to the end of your command. So, for the above, you would type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i5) %o4, numer;
(%o5)             1
</pre>
</p><p>
This use of <tt  >numer</tt> will give you 16 significant figures, but Maxima can
handle arbitrarily large numbers. The bfloat function converts your
result to a numeric representation. The number of significant figures
used by bfloat is set by the variable fpprec (the default is 16). As an
example of really large numbers, try:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i1) %pi;
(%o1)                                 %pi
(%i2) %pi, numer;
(%o2)                          3.141592653589793
(%i3) bfloat(%pi);
(%o3)                         3.141592653589793b0
(%i4) fpprec: 100;
(%o4)                                 100
(%i5) bfloat(%pi);
(%o5) 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693
   &#8618;9937510582097494459230781640628620899862
   &#8618;8034825342117068b0
</pre>
</p><p>
Maxima handles algebra very easily. The
expand function can be used to expand a polynomial&mdash;for example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i1) (x + 3*y + z)^2;
                                             2
(%o1)                           (z + 3 y + x)
(%i2) expand(%);
                     2                      2            2
   ()               z  + 6 y z + 2 x z + 9 y  + 6 x y + x
</pre>
</p><p>
You can do a variable replacement very easily with:


<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i3) %o2, x=5/z;
                       2           30 y   25      2
(%o3)                 z  + 6 y z + ---- + -- + 9 y  + 10
                                    z      2
                                          z
</pre>
</p><p>
If you want to figure out the factors for the above example, use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i4) factor(%);
                                 2             2
                               (z  + 3 y z + 5)
(%o4)                          -----------------
                                       2
                                      z
</pre>
</p><p>
The last set of algebra functions that you might need are trigexpand
and trigreduce. These do the same kind of function as expand and
factor. The function trigexpand uses the sum of angles formulas
to make the argument of each trigonometric function as simple as
possible. trigreduce does the opposite and tries to make the expression
such that it is a sum of terms with only one sin or cos function in
each term.
</p><p>
Now, you should have enough information to use Maxima and figure out what
you should
have found last month with the pendulum. The only force that is applied
to a pendulum is gravity, constantly trying to pull the pendulum straight
down. This is called a restoring force and is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
F = -mg sin(O)
</pre>
</p><p>
where m is the mass of the pendulum bob, g is the acceleration due to
gravity, and O is the angle the string makes with perpendicular pointing
straight down. The sin function is a bit difficult to work with, so let's
look at how to replace it. If you do a Taylor expansion
of sin, you get:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i2) taylor(sin(x),[x],0,5);
                                  3    5
                                 x    x
(%o2)/T/                     x - -- + --- + . . .
                                 6    120
</pre>
</p><p>
From this, you can see that you probably can replace the sin function with
O, as long as this angle isn't too big. This will give you:

<pre     class="programlisting">
F = -mgO
</pre>
</p><p>
If the angle O is measured in radians, it's equal to x/L, where
x is the actual amount of the arc that the pendulum bob travels along,
and L is the length of the pendulum string. Once you do this, you've
essentially minimized the nonlinear part to the point where you can treat
the pendulum as a simple harmonic motion, with the force constant of
(mg/L). If you plug this in to the equation for harmonic motion, you get the
time for an oscillation given by 2*pi*sqrt(L/g). In a Maxima session,
this would look like Figure 3. You can see that we get a result from
theory that is really close to what we actually measured.

Figure 3. Time for an Oscillation

In the coming months, I'll look at more of Maxima's abilities, including advanced algebra, calculus and even plotting. Until
then, go out and do some science of your own.

A review of a USB drive might seem like a silly notion, but when the
USB drive is barely bigger than the USB port itself, it seems worth
mentioning. I recently was sent a LaCie MosKeyto USB drive, and
I must admit, it's even smaller than I expected it would be. In fact,
the cover to the Flash drive is actually bigger than the drive itself!
</p><p>
Because the drive is so small, it makes sense to keep it on a keychain.
Most of my USB drives started with a cap, but after about three or four minutes
of use, I would lose them. The LaCie drive has a neat keychain strap that
secures both the drive and cap onto your keyring. So, if you're
looking for a non-obtrusive USB drive to leave plugged in to your laptop,
or if you want a portable Flash drive that won't dominate your keyring,
the MosKeyto might be just the device you need. It also
comes with some Wuala on-line storage, but really, what's exciting
is how small these things are. They must compress the data or
something&mdash;just teasing, it's obvious they fold the data to make
it fit. Visit <a href="http://www.lacie.com/us/products/product.htm?pid=11546" target="_self">www.lacie.com/us/products/product.htm?pid=11546</a> for more

<h2 class="title">Netflix and Linux, It's a DRM Shame</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #202, February 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
By the time this goes to press, the Boxee Box by D-Link will be in
the wild. I've written about this little guy before, but one of the
exciting and frustrating last-minute announcements is that Netflix would
be one of the content partners. When you add the Boxee Box to the Roku
devices, and even a few televisions, you have a whole lineup of Linux-powered devices streaming Netflix!
</p><p>
Surely that is reason to celebrate. Unfortunately, it's a bittersweet
celebration, because although many Linux-powered devices can indeed
stream Netflix content, Linux desktop users still can't stream to their
computers. Why, you ask?
</p><p>
Simple: DRM.
</p><p>
In order to approve Netflix streaming in embedded Linux devices, Netflix
has included some sort of proprietary video decoder that obviously works
under Linux. Why Netflix won't release that proprietary, DRM-laden software
to the greater Linux community is a mystery. Is Netflix afraid it will
get reverse-engineered so people can watch its streams for free?
Well, unfortunately for Netflix, that probably will happen someday.
If Netflix would release a proprietary, binary-only player for Linux users,
the motivation to reverse-engineer would be close to zero.
</p><p>
So Netflix, do you want to protect your evil DRM? My suggestion is to
release your proprietary binary-only software quickly. I warn you,
nothing hacks like a spurned geek. Oh, and fellow geeks? Why not
drop Netflix PR a note regarding your frustration. The PR page
