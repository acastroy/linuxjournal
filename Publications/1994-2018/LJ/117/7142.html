How to offer better certification, for more people, at a lower

The Linux Professional Institute (LPI) was started in
1998 as a Linux certification organization aimed at removing
obstacles to open-source adoption and increasing
the skill level of its community. Since then, LPI has
delivered more than 35,000 exams in almost every
country and has gained the support of vendors,
trainers, employers and governments. This success
is only the beginning, however. As an organization, LPI has
the potential to turn the world of IT certification
on its ear, just as Linux itself has disrupted
the software world.
</p><p>
Technology-related training has become such a
vendor-driven commodity that it's merely nothing more than extensions
of marketing programs of software vendors. Nobody is taught technique
anymore; it all has come down to locking students in to one
tool.
</p><p>
IT certification now is expected to be vendor-centric, a phenomenon
unique to the IT field. Pharmacists, for example, are not trained to
understand only one brand name of drug.
Even in the case of &ldquo;vendor-neutral&rdquo; programs, such as CompTIA,
vendors still control the certification. The people being
certified and those who would hire them have no voice in the training
content.
</p><p>
Although LPI has accepted vendor sponsorships to
further its goals, vendors alone do not dictate its
future path. LPI is community-driven and not only
vendor-neutral, but indeed vendor-independent. For
instance, the community demanded desktop Linux
certification, so LPI is working to make it a
reality. More significantly, what we are trying
to do as a body is bring the IT certification
world kicking and screaming toward the peer-review
model that people have come to expect from other
professions.
</p><p>
Given its perspective, LPI finds itself having less in common with other IT
certification programs available to technology professionals and more in common
with groups such as the National Organization of Competency Assurance,
whose membership is dominated by medical and vocational
certifications rather than by IT programs.
</p><p>
While most technology vendors have been hiking
the costs of their certification exams, the
LPI is making a conscious effort to reduce the
costs of its exams and increase accessibility in
every country. In some countries, the $100 US charge
for an LPI exam is an IT worker's salary for a
month. Since LPI's goal is to advance open source
rather than maximize revenue, we clearly have a
challenge ahead. Even in rich countries, the fees
for most certifications often are beyond the reach
of the unemployed looking for new career paths.
</p><p>
A major initiative within LPI is research and
development in ways to lower the cost of computer-delivered education,
while improving the testing technology to deliver hands-on testing in
a scalable, cost-effective manner.
Our growth is
dependent on the progress of Linux and open source, which has made some
significant inroads in the enterprise and public sector.
The City of Munich's decision in May 2003 to select Linux not only for servers
but also for desktops makes it the poster child for
Linux clients. Munich's decision wasn't about price; Microsoft
fought hard to keep the business, according to published reports, and
was priced less than the Linux option. But Linux won the bid.
</p><p>
Although there may be no doubt Linux has global presence, LPI faces
challenges when it comes to making sure that open-source education and
certification are relevant and useful in many languages, cultures and
governmental structures. LPI from its central office alone can't make
Linux relevant everywhere around the world. Nor would a conventional
branch-office approach work either.
Our community-based affiliate
network is now operating in the United States, Japan, Brazil,
Canada, Germany and Austria. More national affiliates are coming
on-line every day; some of the newest additions include Australia,
Nigeria, Bulgaria and China.
</p><p>
The short-term goal is to expand this network of affiliates, but we have
a long-term vision as well: to make sure certification is accessible and of the
highest quality possible, while being relevant in every locale. Even with
our network growing by leaps and bounds, hurdles remain. In particular,
we must make the human resources community aware that Linux
certification is available. Organizations as a whole need to know that if
they select Linux as a strategic technology, expertise is available
to them in the form of trained, certified professionals who have passed
the LPI program.
</p><p>
And while having one's training nullified because of a product upgrade is
frustrating, LPI also understands that re-certification over the years
is as important for the IT profession as it is any other profession. Where LPI differs
from other IT certifications is that if we introduce a re-certification
program, it will be based on fixed-year intervals rather than on
product upgrades.
</p><p>
Like Linux itself, the certification program
developed by LPI demonstrates the power of
community involvement. Unlike any other mainstream
certification program, LPI combines the strength
of a worldwide grassroots network together with
experts in exam development, psychometrics and
delivery. As LPI moves forward, we intend to
keep setting the example that all other IT
certifications eventually will be compelled
to follow.
