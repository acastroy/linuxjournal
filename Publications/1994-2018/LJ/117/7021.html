IBM recently has begun rallying around two major server systems for
Linux deployment on the x86 architecture. On the scale-up front,
IBM offers the eServer x440 line, which boasts scalability up to 16
CPUs in a single system. More interesting to the average user
with a cluster of smaller servers is IBM's scale-out offering, the IBM
eServer BladeCenter system, a 7U rackmount chassis supporting 14 blades.
</p><p>
The chassis itself consists of only a passive midplane, a CD-ROM and
floppy drive and two 10" blowers. Two redundant 230V power supply
modules ship with the unit, and two more are required if the system is running more
than five blades. A single management module with keyboard, video and mouse
(KVM) and Ethernet
connections is included, and support for a redundant management module
recently was added.
</p><p>
Redundancy is a key design goal of the BladeCenter and little
has been overlooked. Four switch-module bays are in the rear of
the chassis; the second and fourth bays are redundant bays for
the first and third bays, respectively. For example, if you install
an Ethernet switch in the first bay, you can install a second
Ethernet switch module in the third bay but not a SAN switch module.
Although allowing full redundancy, this means that only two types of switch
modules ever can be installed at a time.
</p><p>
Currently, IBM offers gigabit Ethernet and Fibre Channel SAN switch
modules. Internally, these switch modules connect to each individual
blade, and externally the gigabit switch offers four copper Ethernet ports
while the SAN switch offers four Fibre Channel ports. With redundant modules
installed, each blade has access to two Ethernet ports and two SAN ports.
The Ethernet switch is a full-function layer-3 switch with a powerful
Web-based interface. The SAN switch is a Qlogic SAN switch, which is
configured through either a telnet session or the Java-based management
software available for both Linux and Microsoft Windows.
</p><p>
The front of the BladeCenter chassis contains a single CD-ROM, floppy
and USB port that is connected by an internal USB hub/switch to each
blade. This switch is controlled by a button on each blade, and only
one blade can access the CD/floppy/USB port at a time. The keyboard,
video and mouse are connected through a separate internal switch
that is controlled by a second button on each blade. Control of the
KVM and USB peripherals also can be manipulated by using the BladeCenter's
Web-based management interface, which allows the KVM output to
be controlled remotely over the Web. Unfortunately, although redundant
KVM/management modules may be installed, only one blade can be assigned to
the console at a time, even through the Web interface. This probably
is the most disappointing limitation of the BladeCenter, but it may be less
of an issue for those using the blades in a true cluster environment.
</p><p>
At the time of this writing, only the HS20 server blade has been released for the
BladeCenter. One might assume these blades simply would be a modified
ThinkPad on a card, but in reality the blade is a miniaturized,
enterprise-class server. Although it ships with a single CPU and
512MB of RAM, the HS20 has a 533MHz front side bus and
can support two Pentium 4 Xeon CPUs (up to 2.8GHz) and four PC2100 DDR DIMMs
(up to a total of 8GB).
Thanks to the hypertheading feature of the Xeon CPUs, modern Linux
kernels can see two logical CPUs for each actual CPU installed.
</p><p>
Each blade also has one 8MB Rage Video and two Broadcom gigabit Ethernet
controllers. Each Ethernet controller is hard-wired to a switch-module
bay, and the driver can be configured to allow these interfaces to
be used individually or in a failover fashion. Two notebook-sized IDE
hard drives can be mounted in the blade, but the optional SAN controller
card overlaps with the second IDE drive, so you can use only one IDE drive
if you also are connecting to a SAN. The SAN card is a custom Q-logic
SAN card, which provides redundant pathways to the SAN switch modules.
IBM also offers a companion blade that allows two SCSI drives to be
attached to a blade, but it consumes another slot in the chassis.
</p><p>
The blades are hot-swappable and generally easy to upgrade. If a blade
suffers catastrophic failure, the blade can be removed and an onboard
diagnostic system flashes an LED next to the faulty component. I did
find that installing the heatsink on the second CPU required a disturbing
amount of force due to the spring-loaded screws used to secure it.
</p><p>
An interesting design characteristic of the BladeCenter is that IBM
promises they eventually will release blades based on their
pSeries and iSeries server lines. This means you can mix and match both Intel and
mainframe-class blades in the same chassis. At the time of this writing, no such products have
been announced formally, though.
</p><p>
As mentioned earlier, the BladeCenter has a powerful Web-based interface.
Blades can be powered on and off, the CD/floppy or console port can be
switched and firmware can be updated over the Web. At this time,
user names and passwords must be defined within the management console,
which is bothersome because those user names then must be defined again in
each Ethernet and SAN switch module. In addition, security controls are coarse.
Users cannot be granted access to only certain blades or limited
to performing only certain tasks. Although users can be limited to
having only view access, this limit also prevents those users from utilizing
the remote console.
</p><p>
In addition to the Web interface, the BladeCenter includes licenses for
the powerful IBM Director 4.1 management software, which is so featureful
it deserves its own review. It is worth mentioning that
the client, agent and server components of Director 4.1 all run under
Linux and allow you to perform diagnostics, start and stop processes and
receive automated alerts about all IBM servers from a single console.
</p><p>
Support for Linux on the BladeCenter is far better than I have
found from any other server vendor. Linux driver CDs are supplied in the
box, and all general management tools are written in Java with complete
Linux support. In fact, I have yet to find any management, monitoring
or configuration tools related to the BladeCenter that are Windows-only.
This is a refreshing change from past experiences with even the most
dedicated Linux hardware vendors. Although official support currently
is limited to Red Hat Linux 7.3, Red Hat Advanced Server 2.1 and SuSE
Linux 8, I had no trouble running Red Hat 8.0 and 9.
</p><p>
If you have need of any custom peripherals, cards or interfaces on
your server, the BladeCenter is not an option as there are no PCI or
per-blade I/O ports. The addition of a single USB port dedicated to
each blade would have made the BladeCenter a more versatile system.
</p><p>
Another important consideration is that if you do not have a dedicated
server room, the BladeCenter can be uncomfortably loud. In fact, it is
so loud that IBM sells an Acoustic Attenuation Unit (AAU), which essentially is a large
foam muffler. Even with the AAU in place, it is possible to hear the
BladeCenter running through an office wall.
</p><p>
IBM claims the BladeCenter is priced so that it is a lower cost
alternative to standalone servers when buying seven or more blades.
It is uncommon to find standalone servers with the level of redundancy
that the BladeCenter includes, but I believe the cost claim to be true
even compared to servers with fewer features. Overall, the BladeCenter is
a remarkable bit of engineering. It is probably best suited for those
building high-density clusters, but when coupled with a SAN, it makes a
great option for general-purpose servers as well.
