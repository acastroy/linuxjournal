Will your next laptop &ldquo;just work&rdquo; with Linux? And when will
you be able to buy a major-label laptop without a proprietary OS
anyway?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21c5580.0x22bd2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Let's do a check-box progress report on Linux World Domination of
computer hardware types. We'll run down the scale, starting at the top:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Mainframes
</p></li><li><p>
Big enterprise database machines
</p></li><li><p>
Big compute farms
</p></li><li><p>
Symmetrical multiprocessing machines
</p></li><li><p>
Small- and medium-sized business machines
</p></li><li><p>
Engineering workstations
</p></li><li><p>
Desktops
</p></li><li><p>
Laptops
</p></li><li><p>
Notebooks
</p></li><li><p>
PDAs
</p></li><li><p>
Embedded devices
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Looks pretty good. At the high end, gains will increase as the 2.6
kernel begins to establish itself. At the low end, the contest is all
but over. Ken Nelson, President and CEO
of CACMedia (<a href="http://cacmedia.tv" target="_self">cacmedia.tv</a>) and a veteran of the consumer electronics
business, tells me Linux &ldquo;owns the embedded category&rdquo;. Even Microsoft is
a distant also-ran.
</p><p>
The standout exceptions are desktops, laptops, notebooks and PDAs. And of
those four, the one that matters is laptops. That's where the center of
gravity in personal computing is moving today.
In the last year, &ldquo;Desktop Replacement&rdquo; became a leading laptop
category as well as a description of what's happening to the
marketplace. Thanks to desktop-grade functionality
and the growth of wireless networking, Wi-Fi-enabled laptops are
doing to desktops what cell phones did to desk phones. As a result,
desktops are turning into cubicleware at work, while at home they are
morphing into forms that are sure to displace TV as the central
household entertainment appliance.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, laptops are getting more fully functional every day.
For under $2,000 US you can get a high-speed laptop with a 1600 &times; 1200
display, a gigabyte of RAM, 80+GB of storage, a good sound system, a
first-rate graphics subsystem and a drive for burning as well as playing
both CDs and DVDs. For display alone, laptops kick desktop butt. As one
hardware company executive put it, &ldquo;You want a two megapixel
display&mdash;get a big-screen laptop. It's priced in the same range as a
standalone display.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Linux isn't pushing these developments; Apple and Microsoft are. With
all due respect to the innovations involved (credit where due: there are
many, especially on Apple's part), the leverage comes from relationships
between manufacturing companies. Thanks to design agreements between
laptop makers and the sources of graphics subsystems, namely NVIDIA and
ATI, new Mac OS X and Windows laptops can play a DVD with
minimal CPU involvement. Linux doesn't have that privilege&mdash;yet.
</p><p>
Linus explained the situation in the long talk he gave on the
Linux Lunacy Geek Cruise in September 2003:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Quite honestly, none of the laptop vendors support Linux at all,
really. To be real. Some of them go through a certain amount of
motions. They support Linux in certain configurations if it's not
too painful. But the amount of support tends to be okay (to a
limited degree). It may not suspend. It may not actually do half of
the things you want a laptop to do. But you <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> run Linux on it.
I expect that to change as companies start to use Linux more on the
desktop. If you have a few big companies that just say, &ldquo;Hey, Linux
<span   class="emphasis"><em>has</em></span> to work on our laptops&rdquo;, suddenly hardware manufacturers will start caring a whole lot more....
</p><p>
So, the good news is laptops are moving away from the embedded
machine kind of thing. They are getting <span   class="emphasis"><em>so</em></span> standardized.
Especially with chipsets like Centrino. If you use the Pentium-M
and you don't use Centrino, you are doing stuff wrong&mdash;except for
the fact that they don't support (802.11) A&amp;G; and right now you
can't get Centrino drivers for Linux....
</p><p>
I've also heard that they
exist, but other people at Intel say &ldquo;That's crap. We have it on the
road map, but we haven't been able to get it going.&rdquo; They have been
promising them for 2004, but I am not an Intel spokesman by any
stretch. So I don't know what the actual date is. But it is supposed
to come.
</p><p>
The thing is, when you built a laptop, you used to have to scrounge
around people's backyards to find strange pieces of hardware just to
make it all fit. And that is definitely going away.
And that's not just Centrino. Instead of having hundreds of
different chipsets that you wire up a million different ways, you're
going to have maybe five different chipsets, and you can't wire them
up any way other than the way they are wired up. And that's just
going to happen.
</p><p>
This is what we had on the desktop ten years ago. Compaq made their
own PC desktops that weren't quite standard. Actually HP was worse.
And that just went away because of standard chipsets. And it's
starting to happen in laptop space now.
So, a year from now, I'd expect...assuming we can fight those ACPI
issues...it's much more likely that when you buy a laptop it will
just work.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Markets get made in exactly two ways. The first is &ldquo;find customer
needs and satisfy them.&rdquo; When a bunch of companies start doing that and
competing to make the best products and services, you have a market.
Reduced to a single phrase, Marketing 101 teaches &ldquo;Necessity is the
mother of invention.&rdquo; The second way is less obvious, but without it we
wouldn't have a single technology category. It goes like this: make
something so new and cool that customers think they have to have
it.
They hardly teach this in marketing school, but if they did, the
single-phrase version would be &ldquo;Invention is the mother of
necessity.&rdquo;
</p><p>
When people ask you how Apple can drive whole markets and establish new
technology standards (hard-case floppies, SCSI, flat screens, USB,
FireWire, GUIs, Wi-Fi and so on) over and over again, point them to
that second marketing principle. Apple does a great job of inventing
needs. It's a skill that goes beyond simple innovation.
Steve Jobs'
genius is not his obsession with art; that's a real asset, but it's also
a red herring. His genius is knowing how invention can lever the world.
</p><p>
Invention is not what Microsoft does. And it's not what Linux does, either.
Microsoft innovates, as they'll tell you, over and over again&mdash;and
they're right. The company comes up with an endless series of modest
but marketable improvements to goods largely invented elsewhere. Although
Microsoft has an abundance of red herring assets (credit where due), its
real genius may lie in the very hole where we currently find Linux in
respect to laptops: in relationships with hardware OEMs. These
relationships are highly muscular on Microsoft's part and deeply
involved. Look at any laptop today, and you see a little sticker that
says &ldquo;designed for Windows XP&rdquo; or something similar, along with a Microsoft
Windows logo. You can imagine the extent to which Microsoft labors,
within its hardware OEM relationships, to make sure Linux has the
hardest possible time running on laptops.
</p><p>
And don't discount the manufacturers' shared interest in the same
resistance. No tier-one hardware manufacturer wants to see the world
filled with white box or build-it-yourself laptops. What makes each of
their laptops unique may be the very thing that keeps Linux from
running on every model across the board, from one manufacturer to another.
But that's not a problem. Not in the long run, which may not take very
long at all.
</p><p>
In the emerging laptop market ecology, three parties
will represent three different forces: Apple the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>inventor</em></span>, Microsoft the <span   class="emphasis"><em>innovator</em></span>
and Linux the <span   class="emphasis"><em>disrupter</em></span>.
</p><p>
In <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Companies
to Fail</em></span>, Clayton Christensen lays out the last two roles rather
clearly. Innovators find it hard to disrupt themselves. They resist
the inevitable, even as they see it coming.
Incumbent innovators could be found in every one of the computing categories
we checked at the start of this column. Linux disrupted all of them. The
ones that embraced the disruption, starting with IBM, have made the
most of innovation as well.
</p><p>
Linux also will disrupt laptops and the remaining categories for the
simple reason taught in Marketing 101: necessity will mother
invention. One of these months, some company&mdash;a FedEx, a Boeing, a
General Motors, a Siemens&mdash;will call on Dell, HP and IBM to compete for
filling a gargantuan Linux laptop order. The relationship with Microsoft
will be strained for the winner of the contest, but they'll do the deal.
They'll lean on Intel to release the Linux device drivers for Centrino.
They'll work with Canon and Sony to get the device drivers written for
the cameras, camcorders and scanners. They'll finish hammering out the
ACPI issues. And we'll have good, cheap Linux laptops being marketed,
with real advertising, by the big hardware OEMs.
</p><p>
Then you can start checking off the rest of the list.
