Once you learn the ioctl system call, you'll be able to
check the status of the Ethernet link light and other
miscellaneous but important facts about hardware.

A few years ago, I had a laptop that I used at work and at home. To
simplify my network configuration and not have to change it manually
depending on where I was, I decided to use DHCP in both places. It
was the standard at work, so I implemented a DHCP server at home.
This worked well except when I booted the system without it being
plugged in to either network. When I did, the laptop spent a lot of time
trying to find a DHCP server without success before continuing the
rest of the startup process.
</p><p>
I concluded that an ideal solution to this lag time would be for the system to start
with the Ethernet interface down and have it come up if, and only
if, the cable was connected to a hub, that is, if I had a link light on the
Ethernet interface. The best way to do this
appeared to be having a shell script call a program whose return code would indicate
whether a link had been established on a particular network
interface. So began my quest for a method to determine this link
status of my 10/100Base-T interface.
</p><p>
Not having done much low-level Linux programming, it took me a bit of
time to discover that most of this type of interaction with device
drivers usually is done through the ioctl library call (an abbreviation
of I/O control), prototyped in sys/ioctl.h:

<pre     class="programlisting">
int ioctl(int, int, ...)
</pre>
</p><p>
The first argument is a file descriptor. Because all devices in Linux
are accessed like files, the file descriptor used usually is one
that has been opened with the device to which you are interfacing as the
target. In the case of Ethernet interfaces, however, the fd
simply is an open socket. Apparently, no need exists to bind
this socket to the interface in question.
</p><p>
The second argument in ioclt.h is an integer that represents an identification
number of the specific request to ioctl. The requests
inherently must vary from device to device. You can, for example, set the
speed of a serial device but not a printer device. Of course,
a specific set of commands exists for network interfaces.
</p><p>
Additional arguments are optional and could vary from the ioctl
implementation on one device to the implementation on another.
As far as I can tell, a third argument always is present, and I have yet to
find more than a third. This third argument usually seems to be a
pointer to a structure. This allows the passing
of an arbitrary amount of data in both directions, the data being defined by the structure
to which the pointer refers, simply by passing the pointer.
</p><p>
A basic example of how ioctl works is shown in the following simple program
that
checks the status of one signal on a serial port:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#include &lt;termios.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;

main()
{
  int fd, status;

   fd = open("/dev/ttyS0", O_RDONLY);
   if (ioctl(fd, TIOCMGET, &amp;status) == -1)
      printf("TIOCMGET failed: %s\n",
             strerror(errno));
   else {
      if (status &amp; TIOCM_DTR)
         puts("TIOCM_DTR is not set");
      else
         puts("TIOCM_DTR is set");
   }
   close(fd);
}

</pre>
</p><p>
This program opens a tty (serial port) and then calls ioctl with
the fd of the serial port, the command <b  >TIOCMGET</b>
(listed as <tt  >get
the status of modem bits</tt>) and a pointer to an integer into which
the result is returned.
</p><p>
The ioctl result then is checked to see whether an error was made in
processing the request. If there are no problems, we check the
values returned by anding them with TIOCM_DTR. This step yields true
or false, nonzero or zero, respectively.
</p><p>
Using ioctl for Ethernet drivers is a similar process. The third
parameter to ioctl calls for socket ioctl calls (where the fd is
a socket handle) often is a pointer to a ifreq (interface request)
structure. The type deceleration for ifreq structures can be found in
net/if.h.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, documentation for many of the ioctl interfaces
is difficult to find, and there are at least three different APIs for
accessing network interfaces. I originally wrote this program using
the MII (media independent interface) method.
While writing this article, with the most recent kernel
installed on my machine, however, I discovered I had to add the ETHTOOL method.
</p><p>
After adding ETHTOOL, I then modified the program and wrote each interface method as a
subroutine. The modified program tries one method, and if it fails,
attempts the other. The third method predates the MII API, and I have
not yet run into a machine on which I have needed it, so the code is
not included.
</p><p>
The information on using the MII interface was acquired mainly by
examining the mii-diag program
(<a href="ftp://ftp.scyld.com/pub/diag/mii-diag.c" target="_self">ftp.scyld.com/pub/diag/mii-diag.c</a>) written by Donald
Becker, which I found on Scyld Computing Corporation's Web site. This site
also contains an excellent page
(<a href="http://www.scyld.com/diag/mii-status.html" target="_self">www.scyld.com/diag/mii-status.html</a>) explaining the details of
the MII status words that the ioctl functions may return. Here,
however, I focus on the ETHTOOL interface because it is the newer method.
The program and both interfaces are available
from the <i  >Linux Journal</i> FTP site at <a href="../listings/117/6908.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue117/6908.tgz</a>.
</p><p>
Information on using the ETHTOOL API also was acquired by scouring
various pieces of source code, not the least of which was the source
code for the network interface drivers themselves&mdash;particularly
eepro100.c. Also helpful was an e-mail
written by Tim Hockin that I found while Googling.
</p><p>
In writing my program, I set the default interface to eth0 unless a
parameter was passed to the program. The interface ID is stored in
ifname. Because the ioctl commands I use are specific to network
interfaces, using some other device likely will cause a &ldquo;cannot
determine status&rdquo; to be returned.
</p><p>
Before calling ioctl we need a file handle, so we first must open a
socket:

<pre     class="programlisting">

int skfd;
if (( skfd = socket( AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0 ) ) &lt; 0 )
   {
   printf("socket error\n");
   exit(-1);
   }

</pre>
</p><p>
In the standard try-to-check-for-all-errors C coding style, I
placed this inside an if statement that simply prints an error and terminates
the program, returning a -1 if the socket does not open properly.
For my purposes, I would rather report errors in determining status
as a lack of a link rather than as a presence of one, so a found
link is reported as 0 and not found is reported as 1.
</p><p>
The new ETHTOOL API for interfacing to the driver has made
determining the status of the link much easier than did the previous
method. ioctl was implemented for ETHTOOL interfaces such that there
is now only ONE ioctl command, SIOCETHTOOL (which specifies that the
call is an ETHTOOL command), and the data block passed then contains
the specific subcommand for the ETHTOOL interface.
</p><p>
The standard ioctl data structure (type ifreq) requires two
additional items: the name of the interface to which the command
should be applied and an address of a structure (type ethtool_value)
in which to store the specific command as well as the returned
information.
</p><p>
The structures and most other information (including the commands
available) are located in the ethtool.h header file. The command
that I needed was ETHTOOL_GLINK, documented as &ldquo;get link
status&rdquo;,
which I stored in edata.cmd:

<pre     class="programlisting">
edata.cmd = ETHTOOL_GLINK;
</pre>
</p><p>
The name of the interface and the address of the edata structure both
need to be placed into the ifreq structure:

<pre     class="programlisting">

strncpy(ifr.ifr_name, ifname, sizeof(ifr.ifr_name)-1);
ifr.ifr_data = (char *) &amp;edata;

</pre>
</p><p>
At this point, all that remains is making the ioctl call, checking
the return value (to be sure the command type was allowed) and
checking the data in the structure pointed to by the returned pointer
to see if the link is up or down:

<pre     class="programlisting">

if (ioctl(skfd, SIOCETHTOOL, &amp;ifr) == -1) {
    printf("ETHTOOL_GLINK failed: %s\n", strerror(errno));
    return 2;
}
return (edata.data ? 0 : 1);

</pre>
</p><p>
In this case, my code returns a 0 for link up, a 1 for link down and
a 2 for undetermined or failure. This code allows me to call this
function from my rc.local, bring the interface up and either call dhcpcd
or pump to get an IP address only if the system is plugged in to a
functioning hub/switch.
Here is the relevant section of rc.local:

<pre     class="programlisting">

/root/sense_link/sense_link | logger
if /root/sense_link/sense_link &gt; /dev/null; then
  logger "No link sense -- downing eth0"
  /sbin/ifconfig eth0 down
else
  logger "Sensed link - dhcping eth0"
  /sbin/dhcpcd eth0
fi

</pre>
</p><p>
First, the output of sense_link is sent to the system log. Then, if
no link was sensed on eth0, or if it could not be determined,
a message is written to the log and eth0 is taken down. If a link was sensed,
dhcpcd is executed on eth0.
</p><p>
Once this is implemented, my rc.local file now executes quite quickly when
no network cable is plugged in or when a DHCP server is active
and found. The only time I still experience significant delays is if I
am plugged in to a network where there is no active DHCP server.
</p><p>
I haven't yet tried this code with my 802.11b card to see if it can detect a
link on it before attempting to contact a DHCP server, because I usually only
have the PCMCIA card plugged in when I am in a location that I know has a
server. It would be an interesting experiment and a useful extension,
however, for an interested party.
