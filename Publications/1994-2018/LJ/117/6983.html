It's a given that all disks eventually die, and it's easy to see
why. The platters in a modern disk drive rotate more than a hundred
times per second, maintaining submicron tolerances between the disk
heads and the magnetic media that store data. Often they run 24/7 in
dusty, overheated environments, thrashing on heavily loaded or
poorly managed machines. So, it's not surprising that experienced
users are all too familiar with the symptoms of a dying disk. Strange
things start happening. Inscrutable kernel error messages cover the
console and then the system becomes unstable and locks up. Often, entire
days are lost repeating recent work, re-installing the OS and trying
to recover data. Even if you have a recent backup, sudden disk
failure is a minor catastrophe.
</p><p>
Many users and system administrators don't know that Self-Monitoring, Analysis and
Reporting Technology systems (SMART) are built in to most modern ATA
and SCSI hard disks. SMART disk drives internally monitor their own health
and performance. In many cases, the disk itself provides advance
warning that something is wrong, helping to avoid the scenario
described above. Most implementations of SMART also allow users to
perform self-tests on the disk and to monitor a number of performance
and reliability attributes.
</p><p>
By profession I am a physicist. My research group runs a large
computing cluster with 300 nodes and 600 disk drives, on which more than
50TB of physics data are stored. I became interested in SMART
several years ago when I realized it could help reduce downtime
and keep our cluster operating more reliably. For about a year I have
been maintaining an open-source package called smartmontools,
a spin-off of the UCSC smartsuite package, for this purpose.
</p><p>
In this article, I explain how to use smartmontools'
smartctl utility and smartd d&aelig;mon to monitor the
health of a system's disks. See <a href="http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net" target="_self">smartmontools.sourceforge.net</a> for download and installation
instructions and consult the WARNINGS file for a list of problem
disks/controllers. Additional documentation can be found in the man
pages (<tt  >man smartctl</tt> and <tt  >man
smartd</tt>) and on the Web
page.
</p><p>
Versions of smartmontools are available for Slackware, Debian, SuSE,
Mandrake, Gentoo, Conectiva and other Linux distributions. Red Hat's
existing products contain the UCSC smartsuite versions of smartctl and
smartd, but the smartmontools versions will be included in upcoming
releases.
</p><p>
To understand how smartmontools works, it's helpful to know the
history of SMART. The original SMART spec (SFF-8035i) was written by
a group of disk drive manufacturers. In Revision 2 (April 1996) disks
keep an internal list of up to 30 Attributes corresponding to
different measures of performance and reliability, such as read and
seek error rates. Each Attribute has a one-byte normalized value
ranging from 1 to 253 and a corresponding one-byte threshold. If
one or more of the normalized Attribute values less than or equal
to its corresponding threshold, then either the disk is expected to
fail in less than 24 hours or it has exceeded its design or usage
lifetime. Some of the Attribute values are updated as the disk
operates. Others are updated only through off-line tests that
temporarily slow down disk reads/writes and, thus, must be run with a
special command. In late 1995, parts of SFF-8035i were merged into the
ATA-3 standard.
</p><p>
Starting with the ATA-4 standard, the
requirement that disks maintain an internal Attribute table was
dropped. Instead, the disks simply return an OK or NOT OK
response to an inquiry about their health. A negative response
indicates the disk firmware has determined that the disk is
likely to fail. The ATA-5 standard added an ATA error log and commands
to run disk self-tests to the SMART command set.
</p><p>
To make use of these disk features, you need to know how to use smartmontools
to examine the disk's Attributes (most disks are backward-compatible
with SFF-8035i), query the disk's health status, run disk self-tests,
examine the disk's self-test log (results of the last 21 self-tests) and
examine the disk's ATA error log (details of the last five disk errors).
Although this article focuses on ATA disks, additional
documentation about SCSI devices can be found on
the smartmontools Web page.
</p><p>
To begin, give the command <tt  >smartctl -a
/dev/hda</tt>,
using the correct path to your disk, as root. If SMART is not enabled on the
disk, you first must enable it with the <tt  >-s on</tt> option.
You then see output similar to the output shown in Listings 1&ndash;5.
</p><p>
The first part of the output (Listing 1) lists model/firmware
information about the disk&mdash;this one is an IBM/Hitachi GXP-180
example. Smartmontools has a database of disk
types. If your disk is in the database, it may be able to
interpret the raw Attribute values correctly.

The third part of the output (Listing 3) lists the disk's table of up to
30 Attributes (from a maximum set of 255). Remember that
Attributes are no longer part of the ATA standard, but most
manufacturers still support them. Although SFF-8035i doesn't define the
meaning or interpretation of Attributes, many have a de facto
standard interpretation. For example, this disk's 13th
Attribute (ID #194) tracks its internal temperature.

Studies have shown that lowering disk temperatures by as little as 5&deg;C significantly reduces failure rates, though this is less of an
issue for the latest generation of fluid-drive bearing drives. One of
the simplest and least expensive steps you can take to ensure disk
reliability is to add a cooling fan that blows cooling air directly
onto or past the system's disks.
</p><p>
Each Attribute has a six-byte raw value (RAW_VALUE) and a one-byte
normalized value (VALUE). In this case, the raw value stores three
temperatures: the disk's temperature in Celsius (29), plus its lifetime
minimum (23) and maximum (33) values. The format of the raw
data is vendor-specific and not specified by any standard. To track
disk reliability, the disk's firmware converts the raw value to a
normalized value ranging from 1 to 253. If this normalized value
is less than or equal to the threshold (THRESH), the Attribute is
said to have failed, as indicated in the WHEN_FAILED column. The column is
empty because none of these Attributes has failed. The lowest
(WORST) normalized value also is shown; it is the smallest value attained
since SMART was enabled on the disk. The TYPE of the Attribute
indicates if Attribute failure means the device has reached the
end of its design life (Old_age) or it's an impending disk
failure (Pre-fail). For example, disk spin-up time (ID #3) is a
prefailure Attribute. If this (or any other prefail Attribute) fails,
disk failure is predicted in less than 24 hours.
</p><p>
The names/meanings of Attributes and the interpretation of their raw
values is not specified by any standard. Different manufacturers
sometimes use the same Attribute ID for different purposes. For
this reason, the interpretation of specific Attributes can be modified
using the <tt  >-v</tt> option to
<tt  >smartctl</tt>; please see the man page for
details. For example, some disks use Attribute 9 to store the power-on
time of the disk in minutes; the <tt  >-v 9,minutes</tt> option to
<tt  >smartctl</tt> correctly modifies the Attribute's
interpretation. If your disk model is in the smartmontools database,
these -v options are set automatically.
</p><p>
The next part of the <tt  >smartctl -a</tt> output (Listing 4) is a log of
the disk errors. This particular disk has been error-free, and the log is empty.
Typically, one should worry only if disk errors start to appear in
large numbers. An occasional transient error that does not recur usually is
benign. The smartmontools Web page has a number of examples
of <tt  >smartctl -a</tt> output showing some illustrative
error log entries. They are timestamped with the disk's power-on
lifetime in hours when the error occurred, and the individual ATA
commands leading up to the error are timestamped with the time in
milliseconds after the disk was powered on. This shows whether the errors
are recent or old.

</pre></div><p>
The final part of the <tt  >smartctl</tt> output (Listing 5) is a report of
the self-tests run on the disk. These show two types of
self-tests, short and long. (ATA-6/7 disks also may have conveyance and
selective self-tests.) These can be run with the commands
<tt  >smartctl -t short /dev/hda</tt> and <tt  >smartctl -t long
/dev/hda</tt> and do not corrupt data on the disk.
Typically, short tests take only a minute or two to complete, and long
tests take about an hour. These self-tests do not interfere with the
normal functioning of the disk, so the commands may be used for
mounted disks on a running system. On our computing cluster nodes, a
long self-test is run with a cron job early every Sunday morning. The
entries in Listing 5 all are self-tests that completed without errors; the
LifeTime column shows the power-on age of the disk when the self-test
was run. If a self-test finds an error, the Logical Block
Address (LBA) shows where the error occurred on the disk. The Remaining
column shows the percentage of the self-test remaining when the error
was found. If you suspect that something is wrong with a disk, I
strongly recommend running a long self-test to look for problems.

The <tt  >smartctl -t offline</tt> command can be used to carry out
off-line tests. These off-line tests do not make entries in the
self-test log. They date back to the SFF-8035i standard, and update
values of the Attributes that are not updated automatically under
normal disk operation (see the UPDATED column in Listing 3). Some disks
support automatic off-line testing, enabled by <tt  >smartctl -o
on</tt>, which automatically runs an off-line test every few hours.
</p><p>
The SMART standard provides a mechanism for running disk self-tests
and for monitoring aspects of disk performance. Its main shortcoming
is that it doesn't provide a direct mechanism for informing the OS or
user if problems are found. In fact, because disk SMART status
frequently
is not monitored, many disk problems go undetected until they
lead to catastrophic failure. Of course, you can monitor disks on a
regular basis using the smartctl utility, as I've described, but this is a nuisance.
</p><p>
The remaining part of the smartmontools package is the smartd
d&aelig;mon that does regular monitoring for you. It monitors the disk's SMART data for
signs of problems. It can be configured to send e-mail to users or
system administrators or to run arbitrary scripts if problems are detected. By
default, when smartd is started, it registers the system's
disks. It then checks their status every 30 minutes for failing
Attributes, failing health status or increased numbers of ATA errors
or failed self-tests and logs this information with SYSLOG
in /var/log/messages by default.
</p><p>
You can control and fine-tune the behavior of smartd using
the configuration file /etc/smartd.conf. This file is read
when smartd starts up, before it forks into the background.
Each line contains Directives pertaining to a different disk. The
configuration file on our computing cluster nodes look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# /etc/smartd.conf config file
/dev/hda -S on -o on -a -I 194 -m sense@phys.uwm.edu
/dev/hdc -S on -o on -a -I 194 -m sense@phys.uwm.edu
</pre>
</p><p>
The first column indicates the device to be monitored. The <tt  >-o
on</tt>
Directive enables the automatic off-line testing, and the <tt  >-S
on</tt>
Directive enables automatic Attribute autosave. The
<tt  >-m</tt> Directive is
followed by an e-mail address to which warning messages are
sent, and the <tt  >-a</tt> Directive instructs smartd to monitor all
SMART features of the disk. In this configuration, smartd
logs changes in all normalized attribute values. The <tt  >-I
194</tt>
Directive means ignore changes in Attribute #194, because disk
temperatures change often, and it's annoying to have such changes
logged on a regular basis.
</p><p>
Normally smartd is started by the normal UNIX init
mechanism. For example, on Red Hat distributions,
<tt  >/etc/rc.d/init.d/smartd start</tt> and <tt  >/etc/rc.d/init.d/smartd
stop</tt> can be used to start and stop the d&aelig;mon.
</p><p>
Further information about the smartd and its config file can
be found in the man page (<tt  >man smartd</tt>), and summaries can be
found with the commands <tt  >smartd -D</tt> and
<tt  >smartd -h</tt>.
For example, the <tt  >-M test</tt> Directive sends a test e-mail warning
message to confirm that warning e-mail messages are
delivered correctly. Other Directives provide additional flexibility, such as
monitoring changes in raw Attribute values.
</p><p>
What should you do if a disk shows signs of problems? What if
a disk self-test fails or the disk's SMART health status fails?
Start by getting your data off the disk and on to another system as soon as
possible. Second, run some extended disk self-tests and see if the
problem is repeatable at the same LBA. If so, something probably is
wrong with the disk. If the disk has failing SMART health status and
is under warranty, the vendor usually will replace it. If the disk is
failing its self-tests, many manufacturers provide specialized disk
health programs, for example, Maxtor's PowerMax or IBM's Drive
Fitness Test. Sometimes these programs actually can repair a
disk by remapping bad sectors. Often, they report a special error
code that can be used to get a replacement disk.
</p><p>
This article has covered the basics of smartmontools. To learn
more, read the man pages and Web page, and then write to the
support mailing list if you need further help. Remember,
smartmontools is no substitute for backing up your data. SMART cannot and
does not predict all disk failures, but it often provides
clues that something is amiss and has helped to keep many computing
clusters operating reliably.
</p><p>
Several developers are porting smartmontools to FreeBSD, Darwin and
Solaris,
and we recently have added extensions to allow smartmontools to monitor
and control the ATA disks behind 3ware RAID controllers. If you would
like to contribute to the development of smartmontools, write
to the support mailing list. We especially are interested in
information about the interpretation and meaning of vendor-specific
SMART Attribute and raw values.
