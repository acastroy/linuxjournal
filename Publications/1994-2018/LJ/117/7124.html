Reorganizing the way Linux caches filename lookups is
a big win for helping to scale to large servers.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf02580.0xffa710"></a></h2></div></div><p>
RCU (read-copy update), a synchronization technique optimized
for read-mostly data structures, recently was added to the
Linux 2.6 kernel. This article describes how RCU improved
the scalability of Linux's directory-entry cache (dcache).
For some more background, see &ldquo;Using RCU in the Linux 2.5
Kernel&rdquo;, in the October 2003
issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.

Linux Directory-Entry Cache</h2></div></div><p>
Linux's dcache maintains a partial in-memory image of the
filesystem hierarchy. This image enables pathname lookup without
expensive disk transfers, greatly increasing the performance of filesystem
operations. To ease handling of mount and unmount operations, the Linux
kernel also maintains an image of the mount tree in struct vfsmount
structures.
</p><p>
If the Linux 2.4 dcache is so great, why change it? The difficulty
with the 2.4 dcache is it uses the global dcache_lock. This lock is a
source of cache line bouncing on small systems and a scalability
bottleneck on large systems, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Visual Overview of dcache</h2></div></div><p>
This section provides background for the RCU-related dcache changes, which
are described later in the article.
Readers desiring more detail should dive into the
source code.
</p><p>
This section uses the example filesystem tree shown in Figure 2, which
has two mounted filesystems with roots r1 and r2, respectively.
The second filesystem is mounted on directory b, as indicated by the
dashed arrow. The file g has not been referenced recently and
therefore is not present in dcache, as indicated by its dashed blue box.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7124f2.large.jpg"><img src="7124f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Example Filesystem Tree
</p></div></div><p>
The dcache subsystem maintains several views of the filesystem trees.
Figure 3 shows the directory structure representation. Each dentry
representing a directory maintains a doubly linked circular list headed
by the d_subdirs field that runs through the child dentries'
d_child fields. Each child's d_parent pointer
references its parent. The mountpoint (dentry b) does not
reference the mounted filesystem directly. Instead, the mountpoint's
d_mounted flag is set, and dcache looks up the mounted filesystem
in mount_hashtable, a process that is described later.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7124f3.large.jpg"><img src="7124f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. dcache Representation of the Example Filesystem Tree
</p></div></div><p>
Although one could search the d_subdirs lists directly, this would be
a slow process for large directories. Instead, __d_lookup() hashes the parent
directory's dentry pointer and the child's name, searching the global
dentry_hashtable for the corresponding dentry. This hash table is shown
in Figure 4, along with the LRU list headed by dentry_unused.
Any dentry in the LRU list usually is in the hash
table as well. Exceptions include cases where parent directories time out,
such as in distributed filesystems like NFS.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7124f4.large.jpg"><img src="7124f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. dentry Hash Table
</p></div></div><p>
Each dentry references its inode using the d_inode pointer.
This d_inode pointer can be NULL for negative dentries, which lack
an inode. Negative dentries can be generated when a filesystem
removes a dentry's file or when someone tries to lock a non-existent
file. Negative dentries can improve system performance by failing
repeated accesses to a given non-existent file without having
to invoke the underlying filesystem. Similarly, hard links result in
multiple dentries sharing an inode, as shown in Figure 5.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7124f5.large.jpg"><img src="7124f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Hard-Link Alias Chains
</p></div></div><p>
Figure 6 shows a high-level dentry state diagram. The normal dentry's
life goes as follows:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
d_alloc() allocates a new dentry for a newly referenced
file, leading to state New.
</p></li><li><p>
d_add() associates the new dentry with its name and
inode, leading to state Hashed.
</p></li><li><p>
When done with the file, d_put() adds the dentry to
the LRU list and sets its DCACHE_REFERENCED bit in
its d_vfs_flags field, leading to state LRU Ref (Hashed).
</p></li><li><p>
If the file is referenced again while in the LRU Ref
(Hashed) state,
dget_locked(), usually called from d_lookup(),
marks it in use. If it still is in use at the next
prune_dcache() invocation, it is removed
from the LRU list, leading again to state Hashed.
</p></li><li><p>
Otherwise, prune_dcache() eventually removes the
DCACHE_REFERENCED bit from the d_vfs_flags
field, leading to state LRU (Hashed).
</p></li><li><p>
As before, if the file is referenced again,
dget_locked() marks it in use so that
prune_dcache() can remove it from the LRU list,
leading again to state Hashed.
</p></li><li><p>
Otherwise, the second consecutive call to prune_dcache()
invokes d_free() via prune_one_dentry(),
resulting in state Dead.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Other paths through Figure 6 are possible. For example, if a distributed
filesystem converts a cached file handle into a new dentry, it invokes d_alloc_anon() to allocate the dentry when the corresponding
object's parent is no longer represented in the dentry cache. Similarly,
using d_delete() to delete the file or directory underlying
a given dentry would move that dentry to the Negative state. On
last close, it would be advanced to &ldquo;Dead&rdquo;.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7124f6.large.jpg"><img src="7124f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. dentry State Diagram
</p></div></div><p>
Figure 7 shows the mount_hashtable data structure used to map
the mountpoint dentry to the struct vfsmount of the mounted
filesystem. This mapping hashes the pointer to the mountpoint dentry
and the pointer to the struct vfsmount for the filesystem
containing the mountpoint. This combination of dentry pointer and
struct vfsmount allows multiple mounts on the same mountpoint
to be handled more gracefully.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7124f7.large.jpg"><img src="7124f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Traversing Mountpoints
</p></div></div><p>
The example filesystem layout shown in Figure 2 would result in
struct vfsmount structures as shown in Figure 8. The
vfs1 structure references the root dentry r1 both as the
mnt_mountpoint and the mnt_root, because this
filesystem is the ultimate root of the filesystem tree. The
vfs2
structure references dentry b as its mnt_mountpoint and r2
as its mnt_root. Thus, when the mount_hashtable
lookup returns a pointer to vfs2, the mnt_root field
quickly locates the root of the mounted filesystem.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7124f8.large.jpg"><img src="7124f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. VFS Mount Tree
</p></div></div><p>
The overall shape of the mounted filesystems is reflected in the
mnt_mount/mnt_child lists. These lists are used by functions
such as copy_tree() while doing loopback mount, which need to
traverse all the filesystems mounted in a particular subtree
of the overall pathname namespace.

Applying RCU to dcache</h2></div></div><p>
A full parallelization of dcache would be quite complex and was deemed
too risky for the latter part of the 2.5 effort. The 2.6 dcache is
but one step along the road to RCU; the goal for 2.7 is to
walk the entire path without acquiring any locks.

Pathname segment lookup is performed by the __d_lookup() function
shown in Listing 1. The __d_lookup() function is invoked with a
pointer to the parent directory's dentry and the name to be looked up. The
name is passed in a struct qstr, which contains a pointer to the
string, its length, a precomputed hash value for the dcache hash table
and the name itself, if desired.
</p><p>
Lines 5&ndash;7 unmarshall the struct qstr. Line 8 hashes the combination of
the name and the parent dentry pointer into the global dcache hash table,
yielding a pointer to the corresponding hash chain.
</p><p>
Lines 12 and 56 demark the RCU-protected segment of the code,
disabling preemption in CONFIG_PREEMPT kernels, as specified by
the Reader-Writer-Lock/RCU analogy described in the article entitled
&ldquo;Using RCU in the Linux 2.5 Kernel&rdquo; in the October 2003 issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>. Lines 13&ndash;55 loop through the elements in the selected hash chain,
looking for the matching dentry. Line 18 issues a memory barrier but only
on DEC Alpha. On other CPUs, the data dependency implied by the pointer
dereference suffices, so on these CPUs, line 18 generates no code.
</p><p>
Because this lookup acquired no locks, it may be racing
with a rename system call. Such a system call could move a dentry to
another hash chain, taking this lookup with it. Lines 21 and 22 check for
this race, but they are not sufficient in and of themselves. Therefore, line
23 takes a snapshot of the number of times that the current dentry has
been subjected to a rename, the dcache d_move() function,
which is used later to determine if any renames raced with
the path walk. Line 24 is a memory barrier to ensure that the snapshot
is not reordered by either the compiler or the CPU.
</p><p>
Lines 25&ndash;28 check the name hash and the parent dentry. If either fail
to match, this dentry cannot be the target of our lookup. Lines
29&ndash;41 do the full name comparison, with memory barrier for DEC Alpha at
line 30. Filesystem-specific name comparison functions may
be provided, for example, for case-independent filesystems, as shown on
line 33.
</p><p>
If execution reaches line 42, we have found a child dentry with a matching
name. We then acquire the child dentry's lock on line 42. Because we
have a lock on each dentry, the level of contention on these individual
locks is much lower than on the original dcache_lock. Nonetheless,
life is not perfect. For example, the lock on the root dentry still is
subject to contention, a topic discussed later.
</p><p>
The child dentry possibly was renamed after the
d_move_count snapshot was acquired on line 23. Therefore, lines
46&ndash;47
check the current value of d_move_count against the snapshot. If the
check passes, the child dentry has not been renamed out from under the
lookup, and lines 48&ndash;51 increment a reference count&mdash;but only if the
entry still is hashed.
</p><p>
Line 53 releases the child dentry's lock, and line 54 breaks out of the
hash-chain search loop. Line 57 returns a pointer to the child dentry
if the lookup was successful, or NULL otherwise.
</p><p>
A failure of __d_lookup() does not mean that failure
is returned to the user process. The file actually
may exist, but has not been loaded yet into dcache.
</p><p>
This function does not protect, however, against all rename-race hazards.
One additional race is caused by the fact that dcache uses hlist
rather than list for the dcache hash chains. It uses hlist to
save memory, because hlist requires one rather than two pointers in
the list header. This does mean, though, that hlist, unlike list, is not
circular. It therefore is possible that a particular dentry will
be renamed such that it lands in a previously empty dcache hash
chain. If this happened at the right time, the __d_lookup() function
could return search failure incorrectly.
</p><p>
An incorrectly returned search failure is handled by the upper-level d_lookup()
function, shown in Listing 2. Any racing renames are detected by the
read_seqretry() function on line 13. As the problematic case
results only in spurious failure, the check is made only on NULL return
from __d_lookup().

Deferred-Free</h2></div></div><p>
The d_free() function must defer freeing of a given dentry
until a grace period has elapsed, because any number of ongoing path walks
might be holding references to that dentry. Deferment is accomplished in the
d_free() function shown in Listing 3, where line 5 uses the
call_rcu() primitive to defer the destructive actions in the
d_callback() function until after a grace period has elapsed.
The d_callback() function is shown in Listing 4; it simply
frees large names stored separately (lines 5&ndash;7), if appropriate,
then frees the dentry itself on line 8.

Rename</h2></div></div><p>
The d_move() function implements the dentry-specific portion
of the rename system call, as shown in Listing 5. Line 5
excludes any other tasks attempting to update dcache, and line 6
permits d_lookup() to determine that it has raced with a
rename. Lines 7&ndash;13 acquire the per-dentry lock of the file
being renamed and its destination, ordered by address so as to avoid
deadlock. Lines 14&ndash;17 remove the entry from its old location in the
dcache hash table, if it has not been so removed already.
</p><p>
Line 19 updates the dentry to point to its new hash bucket, lines 20&ndash;21
add the dentry to its destination hash bucket and line 22 updates
the flags to indicate that the dentry is present in the dcache hash
table. Line 24 removes the target dentry&mdash;the one being rename()ed
over&mdash;from the dcache hash table, and lines 25&ndash;26 divorce the moving
and target dentries from their old parents.
</p><p>
Line 27 changes the dentry's name, and line 28 enforces write
ordering. The name change is nontrivial due to the fact that short
names are stored in the dentry itself, and longer names are stored
in separately allocated memory. Lines 29&ndash;32 update the name length and
hash value. Lines 33&ndash;44 connect the dentry to its new parent.
Finally,
line 45 updates the d_move_count so __d_lookup()
can detect races, and lines 46&ndash;49 release the locks.
</p><p>
In theory, a sustained succession of rename operations carefully
designed to leave dentries in the same directory and in the same hash
chain could stall indefinitely horribly unlucky lookups. One way this
stall could happen is if the lookup is searching for the last element in the
hash chain and the second-to-last element is renamed
consistently (thus moved to the head of the list) just as the lookup got to it. In
practice, dcache hash chains are short and renames are slow.
If these stalls become a problem, though, it may be necessary to add code to stall
renames upon path-walk failure. Another approach being considered is
to eliminate the global hash table entirely in favor of modifying the
d_subdirs list so as to handle large directories gracefully.

Performance and Complexity Comparisons</h2></div></div><p>
Although this change in dcache was relatively small, it had far-reaching
consequences in the kernel, because a well-defined API for filesystems
to interact with dcache was not in place. This resulted in a large number of bugs in
the Linux 2.5 kernel due to filesystems hackers attempting to
manipulate dcache directly in the traditional style. Given that a
somewhat more formal API now exists, we hope future changes will be
less traumatic.
</p><p>
Figure 9 shows the performance of a multiuser benchmark running on a Linux
2.5.59 kernel patched to use RCU in the directory-entry cache compared
to the performance of an unpatched kernel. These benchmarks were run on a 16-CPU
NUMA-Q system using 700MHz PIII Intel Xeons with 1MB L2 cache and 16GB of memory.

Figure 9. Multiuser Benchmark Performance
</p></div></div><p>
Applying the dcache_rcu patch to a Linux 2.4.17 kernel increased SPECweb99
(without SSL) throughput from 2,258 to 2,530 on an 8-CPU PIII Xeon server,
a 12% improvement.
Applying the same patch to a Linux 2.5.40-mm2 kernel reduced the
system time consumed by a Linux kernel build from 47.548 CPU seconds
to 42.498 CPU seconds, more than a 10% reduction. A similar test run
on a uniprocessor 700MHz PIII Xeon system running the Linux 2.5.42 kernel
showed no change. In summary, dcache RCU not only increases scaling for
high-end machines, it also maintains good performance on low-end machines.

Future Directions</h2></div></div><p>
Although the 2.6 dcache system is much more scalable than the 2.4 version
was,
a number of issues still need to be investigated:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Updates still are gated by dcache_lock, which means
that update-intensive workloads do not scale well.
</p></li><li><p>
The global hash table defeats cache locality and makes update code more
complex than necessary. Of course, any alternative must preserve
its benefits, including high-performance handling of large directories.
</p></li><li><p>
The 2.6 dcache code acquires each dentry's d_lock
spinlock, resulting in cache-line bouncing and atomic
operations, particularly on the root directory and on working
directories. Much thought is needed to arrive at a simple
solution, as moving permissions into the dentry turns out to
be quite complex.
</p></li><li><p>
The code that resolves races between __d_lookup() and
d_move() is overly complex.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
We eagerly anticipate participating in the 2.7 effort to resolve these issues,
hopefully resulting in the situation shown in Figure 10.
