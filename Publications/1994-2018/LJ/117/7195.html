If last month's issue left you hungry for more audio and video projects,
feast your eyes and ears on our Web site.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12cb580.0x13c3298"></a></h2></div></div><p>Our new products mailbox has been receiving a lot of press
releases introducing new workstations designed specifically for high-end
audio and graphic needs. If you're an animator, filmmaker or a recording
engineer who uses Linux, hardware and software companies are very
interested in getting your business. But, even if you're a regular
desktop user, Linux developments in audio and video matter, because at
least some of them eventually will make their way into a desktop
distribution. So this month, we're going to point you to some
<i  >LJ</i> Web articles that discuss what is going
on in the Linux multimedia world.</p><p>If you're interested in a sound card that lets you do more
complicated audio tasks, such as recording and mixing music,
Peter Todd discusses &ldquo;Using the Hammerfall HDSP on Linux&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7024" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7024</a>). The Hammerfall is a
professional-grade sound card used in studios all over the world; it
also happens to run under Linux, thanks to the ALSA Project drivers.
It consists of an external module called the Multiface coupled to
an internal PCI card.
Peter explains that the big difference between the Hammerfall and regular sound
cards is that the HDSP &ldquo;is designed as a sound I/O device. It has
inputs and outputs, and you can route sound between them
arbitrarily.&rdquo;
The article also explains how to use advanced features such
as an external time code source, a must for the studio.</p><p>In the early spring of 2003, Dave Phillips, author of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Linux Book of Music &amp; Sound</em></span>, attended the first
conference held specifically for Linux audio developers. The report he
wrote for us, &ldquo;Linux Audio Development: A Report from
Karlsruhe&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6762" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6762</a>), provides an overview of the main
issues discussed at the conference, as well as the directions Linux
audio development is taking. Among the topics discussed was
JACK, the software toolkit that &ldquo;provides a professional-grade
audio server in a low-latency environment, making arbitrary audio signal
routing possible, without dropouts or distortion.&rdquo;
</p><p>Moving on to the video portion of our
presentation, Roberto de Leo's article
&ldquo;Self-Hosting Movies with MoviX&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6474.html" target="_self">/article/6474</a>) explains
how de Leo came to start the MoviX Project
for a self-hosting movie&mdash;&ldquo;a Linux CD
mini-distribution that is able to boot and
play automatically all audio/video files on the
CD.&rdquo;
The main point of
the article, however, is to walk users through the
process of building their own mini-distributions, whether for
playing a movie or some other application.</p><p>Finally, Geoff Draper wrote an article
for us, &ldquo;The Art of Rewriting Old Games&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7083" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7083</a>), in which
he recounts how nostalgia for an old favorite,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Nellan Is Thirsty</em></span>, led him to
rewrite the old 8-bit text game. The new version,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Thirsty Nellan</em></span>, &ldquo;replaces the
command-line parser interface of the original game
with a point-and-click GUI environment.&rdquo; He also
used Alias|Wavefront for the scenery, which we
must admit, is some of the cutest penguin artwork
we've ever seen. Because many of these old 8-bit
games are in the public domain, they too can be
re-created for another generation of gamers. Read
the article to learn exactly what Draper did, and
then go rescue your own old favorite. </p><p>If you do rewrite an old game, set up a music studio or edit films
on your Linux machines, drop us a line and let us know how you're doing
it. And, be sure to check the <i  >Linux Journal</i> Web site often.
New articles are posted daily.
