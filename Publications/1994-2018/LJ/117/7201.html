If the idea of yet another game with cards or guns leaves you
yawning, why not amuse yourself with virtual structures, or sample
our chef's tasty molecules?

It's a methanol molecule, Fran&ccedil;ois. Why do you ask? <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>Non,
mon ami</i></span>,
it may be alcohol, but it bears no resemblance to the alcohol found
in that most noble of liquids, wine. That would be ethyl alcohol, and as
you can see,
its molecular structure is quite different. Why am
I doing this, you ask? Because the theme of this issue is kernel
scalability. You still do not see the connection? Kernel scalability,
Fran&ccedil;ois, is a fascinating area of development. This is the front line
of Linux's future, and the programmers working in this area are doing
fantastic work. It just seemed to me that because we are going to be
sampling a little bit of wine when our guests arrive, a
different kind of scalability might be in order. Fran&ccedil;ois, why
aren't you paying attention?
</p><p>
Ah, our guests are here! Welcome, <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>mes
amis</i></span>, to <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>Chez Marcel</i></span>,
home of fine Linux fare, exceptional wines and from-the-ground-up design. Fran&ccedil;ois and I were discussing the theme of this
issue. Please sit; your tables are ready and my faithful waiter will
run to the cellar <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>imm&eacute;diatement</i></span> to fetch the wine. I think the
2001 Ch&acirc;teauneuf-du-Pape with its rich fruit, tantalizing texture and
complex aromas should do nicely. You'll find it in the south wing next
to the entrance to the reading room.
</p><p>
While we wait for the wine, let me introduce you to the first item on
today's menu. As I was telling Fran&ccedil;ois, I felt that because we are
sampling a little <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>vin</i></span>, our features would explore scalability of
a different sort. Just as a few lines of code can have a huge impact
on the performance of certain kernel functions, so too can a few stray atoms
have a massive effect on a final molecular product. For instance, consider the difference
between ethyl alcohol and methanol. Most of us left chemistry behind a
number of years ago, with the possible exception of cooking,
<span   class="foreignphrase"><i>non</i></span>?
As part of the KDE suite, you can find a little program from Andreas Wst
called <span   class="emphasis"><em>KAtomic</em></span> (Figure 1). It is listed
under the Games menu along with other strategy or puzzle games.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7201f1.large.jpg"><img src="7201f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Building Molecules Atom by Atom with <span  class="emphasis"><em>KAtomic</em></span>
</p></div></div><p>
If you ever have played <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sokoban</em></span>, you should notice some similarities here.
The premise of <span   class="emphasis"><em>KAtomic</em></span> is simple. Execution is somewhat more complex. You are
given a molecule, displayed in the right-hand pane, with its component
atoms scattered in a maze of sorts. Pressing the Tab key (or clicking
the mouse) selects an atom that you then set in motion by
pressing one of the cursor keys. Once in motion, the atom continues to
move until it hits a barrier, either a wall or another atom. In this
way, you create complexity from simplicity. It's also a fantastic way
to eat up your free time.
</p><p>
Just as simple code is used to build ever more complex programs, so too can
we move from molecules to visible structures. The next item on tonight's
menu is a little hard to explain, and I must admit that I had some doubts
when I first looked at it. It's called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Construo</em></span>, and quite frankly,
it turned out to be an amazingly addictive little program.
</p><p>
Ingo Ruhnke's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Construo</em></span> is, in effect, a two-dimensional construction
program that lets you build objects on-screen using rods and springs
connected at points that you define. The resulting structure then can
be run, which essentially means letting real-world physical forces
act on it. The idea is to build a stable structure, which is a lot
harder than it sounds. If your creation starts to waver and finally
crashes to the ground, it's time to rethink and modify your construction.
A note on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Construo</em></span> Web site makes a point of letting us know
it is &ldquo;currently not a real game&rdquo;, but I beg to differ. To get in on
this thought-provoking bit of fun, head over to the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Construo</em></span> Web site at
<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/construo" target="_self">www.nongnu.org/construo</a>.
</p><p>
Building <span   class="emphasis"><em>Construo</em></span> simply is a matter of extracting, configuring
and making. Yes, <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>mes amis</i></span>, it's the classic extract and build
five-step:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf construo-0.2.2.tar.gz
cd construo-0.2.2
./configure
make
su -c "make install"
</pre>
</p><p>
Running <tt  >make install</tt> installs the program in
/usr/local/games. In that directory, you may find two versions
of the program, one called construo.x11 and the other called
construo.glut. On the SuSE 8.2 notebook where I tested
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Construo</em></span>, I found the graphics to be sharper and the text cleaner when using the
X11 version (Figure 2).
</p><p>
When the program starts for the first time, you are presented with a
clean slate. At the top of the program window, you see some keyboard
shortcuts. To the right and left are control buttons. If you abandon a
design halfway when you quit, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Construo</em></span> returns you to that design
the next time you play. If, like Fran&ccedil;ois, the idea of starting clean intimidates you,
click the Load button and navigate to the Examples directory. There, you
are
rewarded with a number of prebuilt structures you can
modify until you feel more confident to create from scratch.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7201f2.large.jpg"><img src="7201f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. <span  class="emphasis"><em>Construo</em></span> makes designing
improbable structures fun.
</p></div></div><p>
To add a dot, left-click on the screen, move to where you want the
opposite point (or joint) to reside and left-click again. To remove
a dot, right-click. At some point, you should feel you've created
something reasonably stable. Click the Run button to set the laws of
physics into motion, and watch how your structure behaves under stress.
In all likelihood, your first creation will bend, twist, topple and
eventually collapse&mdash;which can be a lot of fun.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Construo</em></span> lets you set
objects in motion (check out the basketball demo), put barriers in the
way (colliders) and otherwise release your creative genius.
</p><p>
To modify and strengthen your now&mdash;demolished creation, click Undo and
your whatever-it-is (or was) returns to its former glory.
When you get bored with creating and are ready to start anew,
press C to clear the scene, and you once again begin your
mechanical ascent to new heights.
</p><p>
Building things on solid ground is interesting enough, but try building
them in a 3-D, zero gravity, virtual world. That's the idea behind one
of the strangest games this Linux chef has ever run across. The program,
called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ensemblist</em></span>, was created for a 2003 Paris game-coding exhibit.
This is another one of those deceptively simple ideas that turns out to be
something much greater. All you have to do is build the shape presented
to you on-screen using simple geometric shapes. This assembly uses simple
programming and mathematical principles: boolean, union and intersection.
</p><p>
Have I neglected to mention that the shapes are three-dimensional and
floating in a networked virtual space where they can be rotated
along any axis? This is something the authors, rixed and dom,
call CSG, or constructive solid geometry (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7201f3.large.jpg"><img src="7201f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Building Complex
Objects from Geometric Primitives in <span  class="emphasis"><em>Ensemblist</em></span>'s CSG
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Ensemblist</em></span> is distributed as source from <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/ensemblist" target="_self">www.nongnu.org/ensemblist</a>. After extracting the
file with <tt  >tar -xzvf ensemblist.tgz</tt> and switching to the source
directory with <tt  >cd ensemblist</tt>, you simply run
<tt  >make</tt>.
When the compile finishes, type <tt  >su -c 'make install'</tt>. Now,
run the program by typing <tt  >ensemblist</tt> at the command line.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Ensemblist</em></span> installs in /usr/local/games by default.
</p><p>
What follows is a bit strange the first time around. The program
connects to the Ensemblist Web site, after which you find yourself
floating above a flowchart diagram (Figure 4) where you see your
user name and your current score (which is 1). Below that intro box are
two options, OK and Quit. With your mouse, you can zoom in and out
from this landscape by moving the cursor up or down. Click OK
and you are transported to the game options, where you can choose free
play or select a campaign that takes you through some predefined levels.
You probably want to start with a campaign. You also may want to
ask Fran&ccedil;ois to fill up your wineglass, to steady yourself.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7201f4.large.jpg"><img src="7201f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Play Begins in
<span  class="emphasis"><em>Ensemblist</em></span>'s Surreal Virtual World
</p></div></div><p>
When the game starts, your selected object is presented in the
center of a spherical space bounded by fractal walls. Click the Play
icon to the lower right and the action begins. On the bottom left-hand
corner, a counter ticks away. The objects you need to use to create the final
shape are geometric primitives, and they all are sitting at the top left.
These are spaced with union operators. Clicking on the union operators
selects between union (looks like a U), intersection (an upside-down
U) and minus (a minus sign). At the bottom right, new icons appear
so that you can review the original shape, quit or claim victory.
</p><p>
That's all there is to it. Move shapes in and out of the central build
area according to these simple rules. This also is where you discover
how difficult simple can be. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ensemblist</em></span> is very strange and strangely
addictive. On subsequent plays, you can use the --no-net
option when starting the game, because the existing levels have been
downloaded to your system. Before you click Play next time, take note
of the box labeled Editor. Yes, if you feel up to it, you even can
create your own levels and help build the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ensemblist</em></span> universe.
</p><p>
<span   class="foreignphrase"><i>Mon Dieu</i></span>! It seems that we have managed to come to the end of
another evening. Perhaps, inspired by the complex wonders that
can result from the application of simple ideas, one of you fine people
might turn your talents to building a machine that will give us more
time, <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>non</i></span>? Stretching time certainly would qualify as taking
scalability to new heights. Still, there certainly is time for another
glass of wine. Relax, finish what you are working on, and Fran&ccedil;ois
will pour you a final glass. If you are feeling a little too relaxed,
it is nice to know that the only height you need to raise your wine to
is your lips. A little joke, <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>mes amis</i></span>. Enjoy!
Until next time, <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>mes amis</i></span>, let us all drink
to one another's health. <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>A votre sant&eacute; Bon app&eacute;tit!</i></span>
