Ring bells and more with a simple C program and
inexpensive hardware.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1761580.0x1859240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I recently was given the curious task of making
noise on a factory floor at set intervals. The
company wanted to use this noise to provide
important auditory cues for specific events. These events included the
time employees should clock in, clock out, take a
break and return from break. The
solution I implemented has been working well,
and everyone involved has been pleased with the
results. The gratitude I receive from employees
that clock in and clock out is related
directly to the inaccuracy of their own personal timepiece&mdash;those
with fast watches appreciate the apparent extra time they have
before clocking in. Later, though, they curse me
for being delayed in clocking out
when the watches on their wrists clearly show it
is time to go.
</p><p>
The company
I work for uses barcode clock terminals placed
throughout the plant to record the time that
employees clock in and clock out. In addition,
the barcode clocks also record what job each
individual employee is performing.
When an employee clocks in or out, the
employee scans his or her identification badge
and a barcode representing the job the person is
doing. The clock terminal copies this data
to a buffer, along with a timestamp of when the
items were scanned. CMINet, a data collection
system running on two Microsoft Windows NT systems, is used
to acquire the data from the clocks. The clocks
are polled every minute or so to retrieve the
data held in the clock terminal's buffer. During
polling, the clocks also are set to the local
time of the machine polling the clocks. The data
acquired from the clocks is later imported into
the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system
for job costing and payroll.
</p><p>
The company's policy on tardiness states,
&ldquo;employees will be considered tardy if they
clock in one minute or more after their assigned
start time.&rdquo; Due to the company policy concerning
tardiness, the event bells needed to be synchronized
perfectly with the barcode clocks and the
machines running CMINet. This synchronization
would, in theory, alleviate the discrepancies
between the recorded clock-in time, recorded clock-out times and the true local time. Correct time
synchronization is key, but
it is not discussed thoroughly in this article.
</p><p>
Considering the one-minute-or-more-late-equals-tardy
rule and the fact that employees invariably
become time-challenged when returning from break, it was decided that scheduled bell
soundings would be useful. Therefore, a mission-critical
noise-making system was needed, and I was given the
task of implementing it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1761580.0x18594a8"></a>
Implementation Concepts</h2></div></div><p>
Based on the issues at hand, this project had to meet the following
requirements:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Provide auditory cues using a bell system. The bells need to be audible
and annoying enough to be noticed even after prolonged exposure.
</p></li><li><p>
Provide a simple way of closing an electrical circuit over a computer.
</p></li><li><p>
Provide accurate time synchronization for all time-sensitive systems,
including the machine that would trigger the bells, the machines running
CMINet and, indirectly, the barcode clocks.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
With the requirements defined I began to formulate a plan.
Five new 12VAC bells and a 12VAC power supply
were purchased. These are the same type of bells
commonly used in alarm systems or any sounding
system. The bells physically hammer themselves
in the same manner as an old alarm clock, and they pump
out the decibels. The bells needed to be wired so
that connecting two wires would ring all the
bells in the plant.
</p><p>
To control the bells, we needed to
close the bells' circuit temporarily. I was pointed toward
a specific relay device, the AR-2, that can be controlled
by a computer over a serial port. This device would be used to complete the
bell circuit, causing them to ring. The AR-2 is
sold by Electronic Energy Control, Inc. (EECI) for
about $44 US. It has two relays on a circuit board, and both
can be connected as normally open (NO)
or normally closed (NC) relays.
Only one relay wired as NO would be used for this project.
An enclosure (EN-B)
to house the board also was purchased. An emergency
on/off switch was mounted on the enclosure for use
in case something went terribly wrong.
The AR-2
is documented well enough that I knew it would
be possible to write a program in C to control
it. This program could be scheduled using cron
jobs.
</p><p>
For time synchronization, the NTP protocol was
chosen. NTP clients and servers are unlikely to
have interoperability problems due to a well-defined protocol that is
widely adopted. In addition, NTP clients can handle
network latency, daylight saving time and local
time zones. Free clients are available
for almost every major operating system in use
today. Computers using these clients can readily
obtain time sources accurate to at least
the millisecond. Good accuracy is exactly what we
need when trying to synchronize multiple systems.

Implementation Details</h2></div></div><p>
The five 12VAC bells were installed throughout the
plant and in the designated break areas so that
everyone would hear them. The
bells were wired in mixed series and parallel
with a 12VAC power supply supplied by the
vendor. One lead from the power supply was left
unconnected to provide a point at which the bells
could be turned on and off.

I obtained one of our company's spare Dell PCs
to use for this project, a basic PC with a Pentium
III 750MHz processor, 128MB of SDRAM, 40GB IDE hard
drive and an IDE CD-ROM.
I used what was
readily available, and really, the computer is a lot
more powerful than necessary.
</p><p>
The AR-2 relay device attaches to the computer's
serial port and is controlled by the DTR (data
terminal ready) and RTS (ready to send) control
lines. Setting RTS to high energizes the first
relay and setting DTR to high energizes the second
relay. Closing the bell circuit requires
only one relay, so I needed to be able to toggle only the
RTS signal. Example programs
in GWBASIC and Turbo C were provided with the documentation. I wanted
to write a program using GCC to control the relay
but had little experience in C programming, so I searched the Web for some
well-documented examples of C programs that made use
of a serial port.
</p><p>
The first interesting program I found was
upscheck.c from Harvey J. Stein's
UPS HOWTO.
upscheck, itself a modified version of
Miquel van Smoorenburg's powerd.c,
makes use of both the RTS signal and the DTR
signal. The program originally was used to
diagnose or examine UPS communications with a PC
over a serial port. When starting the program, you
indicate with parameters to which serial device the UPS
is attached and whether to set RTS and/or DTR high. After the program opens the port and
sets or clears the indicated serial control lines,
the program would monitor another control line for
feedback from the UPS. The program did everything
I needed and more. All I had to do was remove the
monitoring part, and I had my C program to control
both relays on the AR-2 (Listing 1).
The program is compiled with the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">

[root@pluto ar-2]# gcc -o ar-2 ar-2.c

[root@pluto ar-2]# ./ar-2

The program compiled with no errors, and
better yet, it ran with no errors.
Using the program is pretty straightforward, but
let's briefly discuss it. AR-2 requires
three parameters: device, bits-to-set and
hold-time. Device refers to the special character
device that addresses the serial device to which
the AR-2 is attached. For example, if the
device is attached to COM1, the device would
be /dev/ttyS0. Bits-to-set is a little more
complicated. It is a decimal
number that must be converted to binary to be
understood. Bit 2 controls RTS or relay one, and bit
3 controls DTR or relay two. So the decimal number
4, which in binary is 100, has the first bit set to
zero, the second bit set to zero and the third bit set to
one. Therefore, if the bit-to-set parameter is the decimal
number 4, the DTR line would be placed high and
the RTS line would remain low. The last parameter,
Hold-time, simply is the number of seconds
the modem control lines should be held in the state requested by
the bits-to-set parameter.
</p><p>
I applied power to the AR-2 board and connected it
to the serial port to test that the program worked
as I had hoped. With the AR-2 connected to ttyS0
(COM1), I attempted to energize the first relay
by placing RTS high by setting bit 2 with the command
<tt  >./ar-2 /dev/ttyS0 2 5</tt>. The program
successfully placed RTS high for five seconds. After the program
exited, it placed the RTS line in its original low
state, de-energizing the relay. Next, I placed DTR
high by setting bit 4 using the command <tt  >./ar-2
/dev/ttyS0 4 5</tt>. Both RTS and DTR could be placed
high by setting bits 4 and 2 at the same time,
using the decimal number 6 for the bits-to-set
parameter. The LEDs on the board are helpful
in determining that both the AR-2 program and AR-2
board are operational.
</p><p>
Thanks to upscheck.c and its authors, I was able
to place both the RTS and DTR control lines in a
low or high state for a specified amount time. Without the source code
listed in the UPS HOWTO, things
would not have gone so smoothly. With a little effort, I was able to
find C source code that was close to what I needed
and modify it to meet my needs. I now can control
two relays from a single serial port.
</p><p>
At this point, the bells could be attached to the first
relay on the AR-2 using the
NO contacts. Before connecting it all, though, I
wanted to put the AR-2 in an enclosure,
a nice little box to hold all this stuff so
the electronics aren't exposed. I used the
EN-B enclosure recommended and sold by EECI.
It consists of two plastic pieces, a
top and bottom, with black plastic inserts to cover
openings on two sides. The enclosure
is rather large for this job, but it works. I had to
cut the black plastic inserts so that the external
connectors would be accessible. Also, a hole was cut
for the serial connector on the AR-2 that would be
used for the connection to the computer's serial port. A hole was drilled for the female
power connector that powers the
AR-2 board. To connect the relay and the bell circuit,
I chose a red and black banana clip,
which can be found at most electronics stores. Two
more holes were drilled for the banana clips. For added
functionality, I added a power switch and power
LED to the top of the enclosure so the power
to the AR-2 board could be turned on and off. The
LED lights up when the AR-2 board is turned
on. With the electronics tested and enclosed, it
was time to move on to the computer.

Figure 2. Connections to the AR-2 Board
</p></div></div><p>
I chose Red Hat
7.3 as the operating system. A fresh install
was done, choosing Server as the installation
type. Once the Red Hat installation
was completed, I began customizing the
box. I copied ar-2.c, the hacked-up version
of upscheck.c, to the box and compiled it. After
it successfully compiled, I copied the resulting
binary ar-2 to the /usr/bin/ directory, because the AR-2
program runs from cron at specific times.
</p><p>
I wanted to allow remote administration
of the cron jobs that ring the bells, so I
really didn't feel comfortable with them running
as root. I therefore decided to add a user for the specific task of ringing
and gave it the user name bell
with the command, <tt  >useradd bell</tt>. The
user bell has no need to log in locally or remotely,
so it is a good idea to change the user's
shell to a nonfunctioning one with the command
<tt  >usermod -s /sbin/nologin bell</tt>.
</p><p>
A problem with permissions arises here that needs
attention. In Red Hat 7.3, the /dev/ttyS* devices
have their permissions set so that only
root and members of the group uucp have read and
write access to them. User bell, however, needs
to be able to write to the serial ports in order
to control the attached relay device. By default,
the user bell does not have read or write access
to the serial devices. To solve this problem,
I decided to make the user bell a member of the
uucp group. As root, I added the user bell to
the group uucp with the command <tt  >usermod -G uucp
bell</tt>. Now bell can use AR-2 on the /dev/ttyS0
device to manipulate the control lines of the
serial port.
</p><p>
For remote administration of the bell's cron jobs,
I choose a Web-based tool with which many Linux users are
familiar, Usermin. I also downloaded
Webmin for the purpose of configuring
Usermin and installed them both. After
installation, I logged in to Webmin and configured
Usermin with the Usermin Configuration module. Because only user
bell should be able to use Usermin, I used the
Allowed Users and Groups module and selected
&ldquo;Only allow listed users&rdquo;; bell, was of course,
the only user I added to the list. Next, I used
Available Modules to restrict all but
the Scheduled Cron Jobs module. Last but
not least, I went into the User Interface module and
clicked Yes for the Go direct to module if user
has only one option. Now bell is the only user that
can log in using Usermin, and when user bell
does log in, Usermin jumps straight to displaying
Scheduled Cron Jobs. I also
turned on mandatory SSL encryption.
Webmin wasn't needed for anything else, so I stopped it with
<tt  >service Webmin stop</tt>. To make sure it does
not start back up on a reboot, I entered
<tt  >chkconfig webmin off</tt>.
</p><p>
Now we can log in to Usermin as the user bell
and easily schedule the times at which the bells should ring and how long
they should last by using the command
<tt  >/usr/bin/ar-2 /dev/ttyS0 2 2</tt>. Employees
can feel comfortable knowing the
bell always lets them know when to start
running. Management can rest easy knowing
they have yet another tool to help keep things
running smoothly, and I can rest easy knowing that
it's running on Linux, which means I don't have
to worry about constantly babying it.

Further Possibilities</h2></div></div><p>
This was a simple exercise that illustrated
the use of controlling devices using a relay
over a serial interface. The low-cost relay used
in this example is capable of controlling
any number of electrical devices. Also available
are relay boards that can be expanded to up to 128
relays per serial port, not to mention analog
and digital input cards.
