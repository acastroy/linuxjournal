    Linux is the natural development platform for the
    Federal Aviation Administration's air-traffic control software.
  </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29db580.0x2ad31e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Many people say Linux isn't ready for air traffic control, but in
reality, it is ready and already is being used. Recently I was
involved in a project that ported the FAA's Common ARTS software
(<a href="http://www1.faa.gov/ats/atb/Sectors/Automation/CommonArts/index.htm" target="_self">www1.faa.gov/ats/atb/Sectors/Automation/CommonArts/index.htm</a>)
to Linux.

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7066f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

When most of us think of air traffic control systems, we usually see round
screens with a sweep. Some people know what the RADAR antenna array looks
like. Between the RADAR antenna and the display are a few computers to
make things easier. The Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) are in the
antenna building, and automation systems are used as well. This article
describes how the automation system works, and where Linux was used.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29db580.0x2ad35b0"></a>
History</h2></div></div><p>
The Automated Radar Terminal System (ARTS) got its
start back in 1964 on Univac computers. The system
eventually went nationwide in 1973. The original computers
have been upgraded and continue to be used today. Many of
the larger sites moved from the Univac computers
to microprocessors during the 1980s. All of the
legacy ARTS software was ported or rewritten in
C to run under the real-time LynxOS during the move
to microprocessors.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7066f2.large.jpg"><img src="7066f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

displays. All the knobs are now menus on the display.
</p></div></div><p>
The move to LynxOS was fortuitous, as it
provided a POSIX base to which further porting
could be done. Using LynxOS also allowed developers to
choose which microprocessors to use. Initially, the software
ran on Motorola 68K CPUs, and it currently runs
on PowerPCs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29db580.0x2ad38c8"></a>
Architecture</h2></div></div><p>
The Common ARTS system is a highly distributed, networked,
multithreaded, real-time system. Absolute reliability is a
requirement. Dual networks are used, and under normal conditions, two
backups are assigned to each specific task. The software is designed such that
some functions of one subsystem can be taken over by another
subsystem.
</p><p>
The RADAR data comes in over serial lines to each of the track
processors (TPs). Normally, four serial lines go from each RADAR
to each TP. The data on the RADAR include the raw RADAR signal, a
transponder beacon (each aircraft should have a transponder that
returns an ID and an altitude in the beacon each time the RADAR pings
the aircraft) and weather data. The same antenna array usually
receives all three signals. Any of the RADAR and beacon data can go
down any of three serial lines, with weather transferring on its own serial line.
</p><p>
The TP is divided into at least two subsystems, the serial message
assembly and the actual track processing. Serial message assembly
converts each message type (raw RADAR, beacon and weather) into a
network message. Track processing involves correlating RADAR and
beacon messages (targets) into a single track. A track is the known
history of the aircraft. Targets can be RADAR, beacon signals or
both. Once a target is correlated to a track, another track message is
put on the network.
</p><p>
Messages usually are broadcast on the network. They are sent using
UDP on both trunks, and each message has a unique packet ID. Each
computer on the network listens to both trunks and keeps a record of
the packet IDs it has heard from each unique network ID. If there is
a gap in packet IDs, a chassis may request a rebroadcast. Duplicate
packet IDs are ignored, assuming it was the message on the other
trunk or some other chassis requesting a rebroadcast.
</p><p>
Each system must broadcast heartbeats on the network. If a heartbeat is
missed, it is assumed the system is down, and one of the other systems
sends a message to have a standby system take over.
</p><p>
The next processor to deal with the network messages is the common
processor (CP). The CP does many things, such as matching flight plans to
tracks, sending conflict alerts (CAs), minimum safe altitude warning (MSAW) and
monitoring some of the Common ARTS system heartbeats. The biggest
thing the CP does is determine airspeed and direction of a track.
</p><p>
CA uses the speed and direction to look at other tracks to determine
the possibility of a conflict. If a conflict is detected, the
CP broadcasts a CA message indicating the aircraft in
conflict. When aircraft are traveling at
300KTS&mdash;about five miles
a minute&mdash;it is important to be looking a minute or two
ahead.
</p><p>
MSAW uses a site-adapted map to learn terrain in the area. The terrain
can be hills and mountains as well as towers and buildings. For
transponder-equipped aircraft, the MSAW system looks at the
altitude and the position and determines if the aircraft may be too
low. If an aircraft is determined to be too low, an MSAW message is
broadcast.
</p><p>
The last major system in the back room is the system monitor and
control (SMC). The main purpose of the SMC is to monitor and control
the other systems. It is a gateway to the SMC display PC, a GUI for
monitoring the network and its current state. Current state indicates
the systems that are on-line, off-line, standby or idle. If a heartbeat
is missed, the SMC instructs a standby system to take over. A
system operator can instruct a manual switch at anytime, load new
software or reboot systems from this PC. The SMC also is used for
recording all the data that crosses the network.
</p><p>
What most of us think of when we think of air traffic control are the
displays: a room full of round vector displays and guys in white
shirts watching them. More and more sites are using large 20"-square
color displays. The new color displays are 2048&times;2048 pixel, X window
displays. The design of the display processing software (DPS) is such
that parts of it can be used by any display type, the color square
display, like an ARTS Color Display (ACD) or the round vector display,
like a Full Digital ARTS Display (FDAD).

display, only the all-brown weather is different. The blue history trails
look similar, and the green beacon and RADAR images are the same. The menu
is transparent to the map, but not weather.

</p></div></div><p>
The DPS receives the broadcast messages and displays appropriate
images depending on the state of the system. In normal operation, the
display includes a track indication, a direction history
indication, a full or partial datablock and the state of the various
systems.
</p><p>
The flight plan information message from the CP is displayed in
the full datablock near the aircraft for which the TP created the track.
The broadcast SMC overall state can be displayed as well.
The network can use one or several hundred displays.
</p><p>
In addition, each system can be run on one or more CPUs. If the CPU is powerful
enough, all the systems and subsystems can be run on a single CPU.

Porting</h2></div></div><p>
Initially, the reason for the port to Linux was to allow developers to test and
debug the systems at their desks before testing on the target
hardware. The target hardware is Motorola OEM boards in a VME chassis
running LynxOS. The systems are relatively expensive, so neither the
FAA nor Lockheed-Martin wants to have a bunch sitting around. Instead,
several test systems are used almost full-time for integration
testing and development.
</p><p>
Because the IS department gives developers a Microsoft Windows NT
PC, an attempt was made to port the software to NT. Most of the port was
completed when I started working for the company. For testing some things,
NT worked fine. An adapter layer was used to make the POSIX threads,
file I/O and graphics behave like the target system, so it wasn't good
at testing those features.
</p><p>
When I started contracting at Lockheed-Martin, I was placed in the
messaging layer group, the group that maintains the
communications, threading and file I/O for the system. Basically, none
of my testing could be done on the desktop, and I had to use the
target hardware. Initially, a side project was working to see if it was
possible, and I was given one old (200MHz Pentium) PC for development
purposes.
</p><p>
Most of the code compiled just fine, although there were some issues with POSIX
standards. LynxOS 2.4 and 3.0 used an older standard, whereas
Linux uses the current one. I initially was doing the
development on Red Hat 7.0 with a 2.2 kernel, and it didn't support
named semaphores or named shared memory segments. In a distributed
system like ours, it is easier to use standard names within a
processor than some other communication mechanism to know where the
shared memory and semaphores are. I did cobble together a named shared
memory compatibility layer, and I found a Russian site with a named
semaphore compatibility layer.
</p><p>
During development I moved to Red Hat 7.1, which was supposed to
support named shared memory, but there was an incompatibility between
glibc and the header files. I was able to look in the source to find
this problem, and I posted a note to the kernel mailing list. Someone
beat me to it, though. To keep things stock, allowing anyone to pick up
any Red Hat version without this fix, I left my cobbled-together
version in the code.
</p><p>
The target hardware was all big endian (Motorola 68K and PPC)
and the Linux PC was an x86 little endian, so I needed to do some byte
swapping to make the whole system work. Many of the files are stored
in binary (maps, adaptation, and so on) format. The networking layer already had a
byte-swapping mechanism built in, and it worked great.
</p><p>
Once I had all the messaging code compiled and running, I needed an
application. The FAA agreed to fund the further development of the TP, CP,
SMC and DPS systems for desktop testing and debugging. The systems
all ported well, but the DPS had some issues with X displaying. Normally the
large 2048&times;2048 pixel display is run on special hardware with two
or three
pseudo-color physical planes. If the maps and menus are drawn on the bottom
plane, the weather on another plane and the aircraft on the top
plane, the whole display doesn't need to be redrawn if an aircraft
moves. To make this plane idea work, the color map was split into
three parts. Being pseudo-color (8-bit) limited the number of colors in
each plane. The map and menu plane got one color (white), the weather
got another color (brown) and the primary display plane got 78
colors.
</p><p>
So, we needed to have more color table adjustments, as normally the
primary display used 250 colors. The large display has an animated
fading history trail that emulates the fading phosphors on the vector
display. It takes 128 color cells to make the animation work. For
this application I made one cell and no animation. It looks amazingly
good. Between finding all the reds that were similar, greens that
were similar, and yellows and blues and whites and grays, I
trimmed the table down to the 78 available.
</p><p>
Once all this was done, I was given a two-plane video card to see if the
system would still work. A change to one compile-time flag had the whole
thing working. The two-plane card puts the weather maps and menus on the same plane.
</p><p>
Two things happened about this time. I delivered the Linux code to the
FAA, and a couple other developers were tasked with getting Linux
working on the target PowerPC hardware. The FAA found a few updates I
hadn't kept up with in the baseline of the code, and we were able to
work together on that. The other developers found most of my #ifdefs
were specific to Linux and not the machine architecture. Therefore, I was able
to hold back my changes to the FAA and make the proper #ifdefs when
the FAA finally took it.
</p><p>
The PowerPC Linux Project was an attempt to improve the data recording
tasks that
the SMC handles. The current system uses consumer-grade, off-the-shelf
optical disks that aren't suitable for 24/7 writing. The new system
incorporates SAN disks, which are more suitable to air traffic control
needs. Although technically a success, the project is on hold for now.
</p><p>
In the spring of 2003, the FAA began using the Common ARTS on Linux for a
noncritical subsystem, an inexpensive gateway system feeding ARTS
data to other systems. Full certification may happen eventually.
