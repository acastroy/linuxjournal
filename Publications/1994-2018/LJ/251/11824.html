Dave adds the necessary code to turn a demo
into a playable game, complete with some rule variants.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d67580.0x1e5f358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my last article, I started developing a simple card game called Acey-Deucey, in
which you deal two cards face up, then bet on whether the next card is
going to be between those two in rank value. In other words, if a 5 of
diamonds and a jack of spades were flipped up, the bet would be whether the
next card was going to be between a 6 and a 10.
</p><p>
I also dug into the math too, if you missed it, because this is a
great game for understanding odds and probability. Remember, any given card
has a 1 in 52 chance of appearing, and because two cards already have been
exposed, that means any given card actually has 1:50 odds.
</p><p>
For the example above, there are four 6s, four 7s, 8s, 9s and
10s, meaning that there are (4*5):50 -&gt; 20:50, 2:5 or a 40% chance that
the next card flipped up will indeed be between the two exposed cards. Make
that 5 of diamonds an ace of diamonds, and the odds get crazy good: 80%.
I'd take those odds!
</p><p>
The math will factor into the script because you actually can have the game
suggest what to do based on the odds. The greater the spread, the better
the odds&mdash;easy enough.
</p><p>
I ended my last article with the game being able to shuffle and deal three
cards: two
exposed and one hidden. Running the program with just that code results in
this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh acey-deucey.sh
I've dealt:
   Ace of Hearts
   Queen of Diamonds
$
</pre>
</p><p>
There's not much to do yet, because there's no game logic, so let's add
some.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d67580.0x1e5f778"></a>
Turning the Code into a Playable Game</h2></div></div><p>
To start, let's initialize and deal out the cards. With the
highly mnemonic function names already assigned, it's quite readable:


<pre     class="programlisting">
initializeDeck
shuffleDeck
dealCards
echo "Do you think the next card will be between? (y/n/q) "
read answer
</pre>
</p><p>
This is good for a start, but as I mentioned earlier with the math
discussion, it can be a bit more helpful, particularly knowing that the
<tt  >dealCards</tt> function ensures that the two cards displayed are in order of
increasing rank, which means that this is a darn helpful addition:
  
<pre     class="programlisting">
splitValue=$(( $rank2 - $rank1 ))
</pre>
</p><p>
More important, it also means that the game can identify situations where
there's no point in betting, like when a 7 of diamonds and 8 of clubs
are dealt out. There are no cards that can be between them.
This is added with a simple test:
  
<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $splitValue -le 1 ] ; then
  echo "No point in betting when you can't win!"
  continue
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
The third card already has been &ldquo;dealt&rdquo; within the function
<tt  >dealCards</tt>, its rank calculated (as
<tt  >$rank3</tt>) and its display name set (as
<tt  >$cardname3</tt>). So, the test to see if the new card is or isn't between the
two existing ranks is the next section of the code required, and it too is
easy:

  
<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $rank3 -gt $rank1 -a $rank3 -lt $rank2 ] ; then # winner!
  winner=1
else
  winner=0
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
So you can pick three cards randomly out of the deck, you can calculate their
ranks and display names, and you can prompt the user to guess whether the
next card will or won't be between the two, then test to see if they
were right.
</p><p>
What's left? Scoring. And, that's done with the <tt  >$won</tt>
variable, which is incremented in a conditional statement that appears
immediately after the test to see if the third card is a
<tt  >$winner</tt> or not:

  
<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $winner -eq 1 -a "$answer" = "y" ] ; then
  echo "You bet that it would be between the two and it is.
        You WIN!"
  won=$(( $won + 1 ))
elif [ $winner -eq 0 -a "$answer" = "n" ] ; then
  echo "You bet that it would not be between the two and 
        it isn't. You WIN!"
  won=$(( $won + 1 ))
else
  echo "Bad betting strategy. You lose."
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll notice that in this implementation of Acey-Deucey, I'm
allowing the player to win if he or she bet the card won't be between the
two, and it turns out that it isn't. This is probably too generous,
because all you need to do is pick the more likely scenario, which is to
say any situation where the spread is six cards or less (like at the very
beginning of this article).
</p><p>
Still, it's not Vegas or Atlantic City, it's just a shell script,
right? So I'll be nice. If you'd rather not offer that option,
simply change the message in the first <tt  >elif</tt> conditional code block and skip
incrementing the <tt  >$won</tt> variable.
</p><p>
All that's left to do is to wrap the entire code block in a big loop
that'll run forever, and use that standard technique of shell
script programmers worldwide:
  
<pre     class="programlisting">
while [ /bin/true ] ; do
</pre>
</p><p>
You probably wondered why /bin/true existed in
Linux, didn't you?
So that's the first line of the main code block, and let's increment
the <tt  >$games</tt> variable in the last line of the block:
  
<pre     class="programlisting">
games=$(( games + 1 ))
</pre>
</p><p>
But there's one more fragment needed, and that's the test to see if
the user guessed that the third card would or would not be between the two
displayed cards, or if the user quit the game. In the latter situation,
it's time to display some stats. That's easy enough, and it turns out that
you
can just leave <tt  >$answer</tt> alone for the yes/no answer:
  
<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ "$answer" = "q" ] ; then
  echo "You played $games games and won $won times."
  exit 0
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
In fact, you'll never quit the game by falling out of the while loop,
but that makes sense since the conditional test of /bin/true is, well,
always true.
</p><p>
Stitch all these fragments together and you have a game, by George!

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh acey-deucey.sh
I've dealt:
   6 of Hearts
   9 of Clubs
The spread is 3. Do you think the next card will 
 be between them? (y/n/q) n
I picked: 9 of Hearts
You bet that it would not be between the two 
 and it isn't. You WIN!
I've dealt:
   Ace of Hearts
   7 of Spades
The spread is 6. Do you think the next card will 
 be between them? (y/n/q) y
I picked: 3 of Spades
You bet that it would be between the two 
 and it is. You WIN!
I've dealt:
   7 of Spades
   10 of Spades
The spread is 3. Do you think the next card will 
 be between them? (y/n/q) q
You played 2 games and won 2 times.
$
</pre>
</p><p>
A perfect score. Nice. Las Vegas, here I come!
