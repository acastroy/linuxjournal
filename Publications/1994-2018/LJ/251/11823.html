Gumstix Inc.'s Geppetto</h2></div></div><p>
Gumstix Inc. is so proud of the embedded systems it designed with its
home-grown Geppetto design tool that it wants the wider world to enjoy similar
benefits. Gumstix calls the new Geppetto 2.0 the most advanced version of the
company's on-line build-to-order tool for designing custom-embedded Linux
systems. This new iteration of Geppetto introduces Tux-approved recommended
mappings for buses, ensuring optimal compatibility between customer-created
hardware and standard Linux images. In addition, version 2.0 offers an
expanded module selection, improved dimensioning, faster UI and video
tutorials. As part of the Geppetto announcement, Gumstix also announced the
Geppetto-designed AeroCoreTM 2 Micro-Aerial Vehicle Control Board and the
Geppetto-designed Pepper DVI-D single-board computer.

Investintech.com's Able2Extract PDF Converter</h2></div></div><p>
It's not a stretch to call Investintech.com's Able2Extract 9 PDF Converter
the &ldquo;Swiss army knife&rdquo; of PDF converters. Not only is Able2Extract able to
convert PDFs to a wide range of formats accurately, but it also features the
unique ability to work across Linux (Ubuntu and Fedora), Mac OS X and Windows
platforms. Investintech.com notes the ability of Able2Extract to maintain
intact all aspects&mdash;images, colors, formatting and fonts&mdash;regardless of file
format. Supported formats include converting PDF to OpenOffice.org, MS-Office,
AutoCAD, Excel and commonly used image formats. The upgrade version 9 adds
secure PDF creation, improved custom PDF to Excel conversion and an improved
GUI and overall user experience.

Linutop XS</h2></div></div><p>
Until the era of the Linutop computer, the word minuscule has not been a
common descriptor for a full-fledged PC. That word nevertheless hits the nail
squarely on the head to describe the new Linutop XS, a truly tiny Linux
computer designed to reduce TCO from shipping to deployment, operation and
maintenance. As Linutop's smallest and most energy-efficient computer to date,
the Linutop XS weighs a mere 3.3 ounces (92 g), measures about the size of
a typical playing card and operates on only 5 Volts and 3 Watts. Linutop says
that the Linutop XS comes loaded with Debian Weezy and ready-to-use
software, including Libre Office and Linutop Kiosk, making it an ideal system
for a wide range of applications in business, government, education and the
home.

JetBrains' Upsource</h2></div></div><p>
The idea for JetBrains' new team collaboration tool for developers, called
Upsource, originally came from the intention to make a totally different tool,
IntelliJ IDEA, available from both the desktop and the Web. The final result
is Upsource 1.0, a new Web-based team collaboration tool that helps developers
read, browse and review code maintained in Git, Mercurial, Subversion and/or
Perforce repositories. Both a repository browser and a code-review tool,
Upsource 1.0 provides instant read access to code developed throughout an
organization and helps improve code quality by enabling easy code review.
JetBrains adds that, thanks to platform sharing with the IntelliJ IDEA IDE for
Java, Java teams enjoy an additional advantage. Upsource boasts in-depth
knowledge of Java code and is able to execute server-side static code analysis
on Java projects, as well as provide code-aware navigation and smart search
for code usages.

Corsair Flash Voyager Slider Series X1 and X2</h2></div></div><p>
The new Flash Voyager Slider X1 and X2 families of USB 3.0 Flash drives expand
Corsair's already formidable arsenal of memory products. Combining the
speed of USB 3.0 with the functionality of a cap-less USB drive, the Flash
Voyager Slider X1 and Slider X2 series share a sleek, glossy design that
allows the USB cap to slide back conveniently into the drive housing, says
Corsair. The company added that the Slider X1 is available in 16GB, 32GB,
64GB, 128GB and 256GB capacities and, thanks to its USB 3.0 interface, is
able to reach read speeds of up to 130MB/s. Meanwhile, Slider X2 knocks the
performance up a level with read speeds of 200MB/s in capacities of 16GB,
32GB, 64GB and 128GB. Both Corsair drive families are compatible with Linux,
Windows and Mac OS X, and they also are fully USB 2.0-backward compatible.

Regina O. Obe and Leo S. Hsu's <span   class="emphasis"><em>PostGIS in Action</em></span>, 2nd
ed. (Manning Publications
Co.)</h2></div></div><p>
Hybrid GIS and Linux geeks know that the open-source PostGIS gives support for
geographic objects to PostgreSQL, allowing the relational database to serve as
the back end for ArcGIS, GRASS GIS and other geospatial programs. The new 2nd
edition of <span   class="emphasis"><em>PostGIS in Action</em></span> from Regina O. Obe and Leo S. Hsu teaches
readers of all levels to write spatial queries that solve real-world problems.
Obe and Hsu start by getting readers' feet wet with a background in
vector-, raster- and topology-based GIS, followed by a tutorial in analyzing,
viewing and mapping data. Readers learn how to optimize queries for maximum
speed, simplify geometries for greater efficiency, analyze rasters, vectorize
rasters, better manage data utilizing topologies and create custom functions.
The book covers PostGIS 2.0 and 2.1, PostgreSQL 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3 features and
shows how to integrate PostGIS with other GIS tools.

Mahesh Venkitachalam's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Python Playground</em></span> (No Starch Press)</h2></div></div><p>
Putting the subtitle <span   class="emphasis"><em>Geeky Weekend Projects for the Curious
Programmer</em></span> onto a book is a sure way to charm one's way onto these
geek-friendly <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> pages. The main title of
said book is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Python
Playground</em></span>, a new book from Mahesh Venkitachalam and irreverent
publisher No Starch Press. No Starch describes the book as &ldquo;a collection
of fun programming projects that will inspire you to new heights as a
Pythonista&rdquo;. Readers will learn to use Python for all kinds of playful
purposes&mdash;for example, to manipulate images, build simulations and interact with
hardware using Arduino and Raspberry Pi. As readers work through each project,
they power up their programming skills and learn how to leverage external
libraries for specialized tasks, how to break problems into smaller, solvable
pieces and how to translate an algorithm into code. The fun projects include
an autostereogram generator, an ASCII art maker, a Conway's Game of Life
simulator, a ray casting volume renderer and an Arduino rig.

Deciso OPNsense Firewall</h2></div></div><p>
Deciso B.V. is a Netherlands-based manufacturer of networking equipment that
developed and recently released OPNsense, a new, open-source firewall that
reportedly &ldquo;combines the best of open-source and closed-source
firewalls&rdquo;. Deciso adds that OPNsense brings the rich feature set of
commercial offerings with the benefits of open and verifiable sources,
combined with a simple, two-clause BSD license. The latter permits companies
to create a branded firewall based on OPNsense, extend its features, or even
create a fork and build upon the same codebase. Key features of OPNsense
include load balancing, high availability and captive portal. The easy-to-use
Bootstrap-based GUI makes configuring and managing the firewall a comfortable
task for administrators. The kicker, boasts Decisio, is that all sources and
build tools are freely available without special clauses and without licensing
costs. The company also puts a great deal of value on the community
surrounding OPNsense, which it says will give users, developers and businesses
a friendly, stable and transparent environment.
