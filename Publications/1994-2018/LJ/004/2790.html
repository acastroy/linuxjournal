    In this article, Robert Suckling describes a &ldquo;real-world&rdquo;
    application of Linux: running a subscription service. He
    also describes some possibilities that he has not yet
    deployed, but has run tests on, and which are feasible.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a5f580.0x1b572f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>A few years ago, some friends and I
opened a small store selling mostly role-playing games. We stocked
many other games and as a sideline some of the partners wanted to
sell comics.
</p><p>A little bit later, after Linux version 0.11 hit the streets,
I bought my first home PC. It was a 386/33dx with 120 MB of disk
and 20 MB of RAM, and for a while it was just my toy.</p><p>Back at the store, comic sales were picking up, and when you
sell comics you also take subscriptions. So Tony, one of the
partners, started to take lists of comic subscriptions written on
paper. When the comics orders came in he would spread out all the
new comics on a table and scan each list for titles on the table,
and when he saw one he would put it in the subscriptions
folder.</p><p>Tony started to stress out when there were about 50 people
with subscriptions. The time to scan the 50 lists on paper with the
100 comic titles spread out on the table was getting overwhelming.
Tony would try to hurry, but then he started to miss comics and
make mistakes, and then people would ask why we did not save their
comics for them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a5f580.0x1b57500"></a>Linux to the Rescue</h2></div></div><p>At this point one of our less computer-oriented partners,
Greg, tried to put the subscriptions on a spreadsheet. He tried to
list each customer as a row and each comic title as a column. It
did not work, because the spread sheet was too wide to print. At
this point I brought in my computer from home, and Greg helped me
type in the comic data. I stored each subscription in a separate
file. Now the big transformation that was needed was simply to use
cat and sort. This turned lists of subscriptions (of titles) into
lists of titles (of subscriptions). &ldquo;The Guys&rdquo; like hard copy, so
they print the list sorted by titles, take each title in turn, find
the list of subscriptions for that title on the printout, and put a
copy into each comic slot.</p><p>My first incarnation of this was written under DOS mostly
with DOS-perl. But being a Unix hacker, I missed all the Unix
system calls and stuff. After playing a bit more with Linux, and
after I installed the first MCC-interim Linux distribution on my
PC, I switched the comic system over to Linux.</p><p>Now the comics were going to the right customers. We still
used the paper pages for users to make changes to their
subscriptions, though. And one of us still had to take each page
each week and enter the changes into a file and print out the new
subscriptions.</p><p>After a few months of editing subscription pages it became
tiresome and error-prone to make all the customer changes.
Customers would come in and ask us where the X-Men titles they
signed up for were, and we would check their current list on the
computer, and it would not be there, but the paper page where they
requested it would be in the book.</p><p>I wrote a set of menus with perl (what else) that would let
users delete and change their subscriptions online. So far, so
good, but we could not allow a customer to add simply anything to
their subscription. We could have a customer try to subscribe to
something new that we could not get for them, so we had a problem
with customers adding things.</p><p>My solution was that a customer could add any title that
another customer was already getting. At least most of the time, if
one customer was getting a copy of some item, getting another copy
was not a problem. For this I took the current list of titles of
things being asked for and made a file that the user could search
through to get to a single item that was desired. This item then
could be added to their subscription.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a5f580.0x1b577c0"></a>Something old, something new...</h2></div></div><p>So now customers were able to add something old to their
subscription. Now for the new stuff. The comic book distributors we
use have a computerized ordering system, so they supply us with a
computerized listing of new titles at the beginning of each month.
This data is in the form of a DOS disk with a file of one-line
entries for each title. Yet another perl script pulls out the new
titles and saves them in another file like the current items
listing I just talked about. Now the users can search through this
file and add new titles to their subscription. The distributers
also supply a 300- to 400-page catalog that we give out free to our
subscription holders.</p><p>There is a two week window each month from when we get the
data and the catalogs to the time our customers can add anything
from the catalogs to their subscription. After two weeks we make
our order to the distributor, so I delete the new titles file, and
the menus detect this and no longer let customers add new stuff, so
only the current old titles are available after the 15th.</p><p>I set up a dumb serial terminal in the front of the store and
wrote some menus that would let customers edit their subscription
file. Customers can add titles from the distributors' listings or
from a list of popular titles. This way a customer cannot add a
title we can not get, but he can change the number of each title or
the starting and ending issue numbers, as well as delete a title.
We have been using this system for nearly two years, and we now
have over 200 subscribers managing over 1800 subscriptions on-line
with Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a5f580.0x1b57978"></a>The competition</h2></div></div><p>Last spring I attended a major comic book trade show for
comic book store owners. One of the speakers sold software that
could be used to maintain comic book subscriptions. I asked him if
he could support customers making changes to their own
subscription. He said, &ldquo;No way&rdquo;-he could not have some kid walking
up to a DOS box, because the kid could type CTRL-ALT-DEL or
something and destroy the database.</p><p>That cannot happen on my dumb terminal running from my Linux
box.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a5f580.0x1b57ad8"></a>In the Future</h2></div></div><p>Another thing I have wanted to do at the store was run an
inventory system on the gaming stock. The gaming stock, unlike the
comic stock, can be reordered from the distributors on demand. My
partners do not understand how easy it would be to implement an
inventory system, but I have all the tools waiting for them, should
they some day want one.</p><p>I have learned how to print barcodes from scratch. I plan to
print product numbers on the labels with my own program so that a
barcode reader can be used at the checkout counter. Given:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>a last night current inventory,</p></li><li><p>a model inventory (what we think we should stock)
and,</p></li><li><p>a POS(point of sale)-terminal,</p></li></ul></div><p>I can maintain a current inventory listing, and a &ldquo;diff&rdquo;
(list of differences) of the current inventory with the model
inventory as a reorder listing. This can be filtered with product
listings from game distributors to make the actual reorder lists
for each game distributor automatically.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a5f580.0x1b57ef8"></a>Post</h2></div></div><p>I wanted to know if Linux and perl could keep up with the
most important store application, the Point Of Sale Terminal, so I
set up a test database using perl's ndbm arrays.</p><p>One day I plan to barcode with &ldquo;code 3 of 9&rdquo;, a popular
barcode format, which would contain the product numbers. Then a
light-pen or a laser scanner can read the barcode just like you see
at the grocery store. With that item code, an item's price can be
looked up and an itemized receipt can be produced. More
importantly, it also lets me make a record of what was sold, so we
can reorder it.</p><p>I have a DOS disk from one of the game distributors that
contains their full listing of products - about one Megabyte of
data: about 50 characters per record, with about 20,000 records. I
set up an ndbm file that mapped product numbers into item
description and pricing information.</p><p>I stored each key (product number) in an array and picked a
random index and looked up that key. I then put that in a loop and
ran a few time trials.</p><p>With my 386/33dx system, I could access over 300 stock items
in my test database per second. If you are really good, you can
scan in about 1-2 items per second, and most people are much slower
than that. In other words, there is plenty of time to make few
database references per item. From that, I can see that there is
plenty of CPU power to run a few cash registers, as well as time to
edit comic subscriptions and even do some reordering, all at the
same time. Remember, this is on an old 386/33dx.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a5f580.0x1b58160"></a>Back to the Present</h2></div></div><p>Every now and then I hear what a pain it is to do a reorder,
but my partners are not yet ready to take the big step to automate.
Some day the store will need an inventory system badly and Linux
will be there, waiting for them. The store broke $1.5 million in
gross sales this spring, after 3 years in business, so we may need
to take this step soon.</p><p>If this interests you, here is our address and phone
