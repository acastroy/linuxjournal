    In this article, Terry Gliedt introduces us to the Andrew
    project, and gives us a taste of one aspect of it: the ez
    editor, which can edit text and graphics, and can be used as
    a word processor.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246c580.0x25642f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>AUIS had its roots in 1982 when Carnegie
Mellon University and the IBM Corporation decided to jointly
develop a campus computing facility based on personal computers to
replace the time-sharing system then on campus. IBM provided not
only generous funding, but also some talented individuals and
access to IBM development programs.
</p><p>The result was a graphical user interface we know as the
Andrew User Interface System and a file system, the Andrew File
System. The file system formed the basis of Transarc Corporation's
Distributed File System (DFS) and is offered as part of the Open
System Foundation software.</p><p>The Andrew Consortium, composed of a number of corporations
and universities, funds the current development of AUIS. AUIS is
available on a wide variety of platforms including Linux, AIX,
Solaris, Ultrix and HP UX, as well as others.</p><p>In June, version 6.3 of the Andrew User Interface System
(AUIS) was released by the Andrew Consortium. This release provided
support for Linux and shortly thereafter, the package
auis63L0-wp.tgz was made available at
<b  >sunsite.unc.edu</b> in
<b  >/pub/Linux/X11/andrew</b>. This particular package
contains just a small portion of AUIS that is suitable as a word
processor. This article will describe some of the word processing
aspects of AUIS. Future articles in <i  >Linux Journal</i> will describe
other pieces of AUIS.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246c580.0x2564608"></a>EZ is Easy</h2></div></div><p>ez is the simplest, most general AUIS application possible.
It loads a document (or creates a new one) and displays it in a
window. That's all. Everything else that happens is controlled by
the document itself. For example, if you are editing a text
document, you get all the text-editing commands. If you're editing
a picture, you get picture-editing commands. If you're editing a
text document with pictures, you get both, depending on which piece
you are working on at the time. The application, ez, doesn't care
(as if any software really cares).</p><p><a href="2786f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Sample ez Window</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246c580.0x2564818"></a>WYSLRN</h2></div></div><p>At an initial glance, the document you see displayed by ez
appears to be What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG). Upon further
investigation, however, you'll see that it really is not. While the
document appears with various fonts and pictures as you might see
on paper, the application does not enforce any concept of a &ldquo;page&rdquo;.
If you make the screen extra wide or narrow, the text will re-flow
to fit the window, not some notation of a page. Documents are
printed in PostScript&trade; (well, not precisely, but that is what
comes out in the end), and of course the X fonts do not quite match
those used when printing. So ez might better be said to be a
WYSIWYG-almost editor. One pundit calls this &ldquo;WYSLRN&rdquo; (What You See
Looks Really Neat).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246c580.0x2564920"></a>The Basic Layout</h2></div></div><p>In Figure 1 you can see a sample of a tiny document. The
application and name of the file appear in the title bar. A small
message area appears at the bottom of the document. Notice there is
a menubar for pull-down menus at the top of the document. You can
select these menus as you'd normally expect. As a shortcut AUIS
applications will pop-up the menus when you press the middle mouse
button (or both buttons simultaneously for a two-button
mouse).</p><p>The scroll bar looks rather Motif-like, but behaves
differently. You can scroll forward by pressing the left mouse
button, as usual, but unlike some scrollbars, you can scroll back
by pressing the right mouse button. In larger documents you can
&ldquo;grab&rdquo; the &ldquo;box&rdquo; in the scroll bar to quickly scroll through the
document.</p><p>Most commonly used functions have been assigned to a sequence
of keys. Many of the common Emacs keybindings apply to ez (e.g.
^x^c). Several function keys have been assigned useful bindings.
F1-3 will invoke the Copy, Cut and Paste functions. AUIS
applications will remember the past few Copy/Cut buffers and F4
will allow you to Paste them in your document and then cycle
through them. This allows you to Paste two or three objects by
simply pressing 4 a few times without needing to repeat the
select-copy-paste sequences. I use this feature all the time and
feel crippled when I work with other systems that do not have this
capability.</p><p>F5 will italicize the selected text and F6 will make it bold.
F7 (Plainer) will remove the last style applied against an area.
For instance, if you press F5, F6 and then F7, your text will be
left in italics because the Plainer function removed the bold
style. F8 (Plainest) will remove all nested styles applied to the
area.</p><p>AUIS applications are highly tailorable. Almost everything
described thus far can be made to behave differently. The look and
feel I describe here reflects the auis63L0-wp distribution. A
future article will describe the various configuration files and
settings and how you can control these.</p><p>This distribution of AUIS has over 800KB of help text (and
this is about one-third of the total). There is extensive help
information on how to use all the aspects of the system, including
its configuration and personalization files. After installing AUIS,
probably the first command a novice would enter is auishelp.</p><p>Figure 2 shows a second window of the same file. You can, of
course, edit more than one file at a time. You can also have two
windows on the same data. If you enter data or make changes in
either window, the other is immediately updated (if the changes are
in a part of the document that is visible).</p><p><a href="2786f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
Sample Split Window</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246c580.0x2564d40"></a>Checkpointing</h2></div></div><p>If you work for a few minutes without saving, ez will
automatically save for you. You can tell this is happening when the
message line at the bottom suddenly shows
&ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Checkpointing...</em></span>&rdquo; and then
&ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Checkpointed</em></span>&rdquo;. The file is written to a
separate file named like the original filename except &ldquo;.CKP&rdquo; is
appended. Thus if you edit <span   class="bold"><b>test.d</b></span>,
the checkpoint file will be
<span   class="bold"><b>test.d.CKP</b></span>. When you use the
&ldquo;Save&rdquo; command, your original file is replaced with the new version
and the checkpoint file is removed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246c580.0x2564fa8"></a>EZ Magic</h2></div></div><p>It is important to understand that the word processing files
created by ez have their own distinctive format, just like your
favorite commercial word processors. This format was conveniently
designed from the start to allow ez documents to be sent via
conventional electronic mail systems.</p><p>This format is the &ldquo;magic&rdquo; that allows ez to be so simple.
The data quite literally defines what can be done to it. As the
data is read, programs that match the data are automatically loaded
for you. ez is not a single program, but a group of programs that
can cooperate with each other, each of which knows how to
manipulate a certain type of object. If ez reads a document with
text in it, the text-editing program edits the text
<span   class="emphasis"><em>object</em></span>. If ez reads a document with a bitmap
(picture), the bitmap-editing program edits the bitmap
<span   class="emphasis"><em>object</em></span>. If your document has several different
<span   class="emphasis"><em>objects</em></span>, all the different programs cooperate
to edit the objects.</p><p>However, you need to do more than edit your documents. You
need to print them and send them to other people, both
electronically and on paper. Therefore, filters have been written
to convert AUIS documents to several different formats. To print
your documents, you can convert them to PostScript. To exchange
documents with people running other word processing systems, you
can convert them to RTF format, the most common document
interchange format. You can even convert your documents to straight
ASCII, though of course all your fonts and pictures will be
lost.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246c580.0x2565268"></a>Styles</h2></div></div><p>One of the simplest things you can do with ez is to add
styles to a document. Styles appear as menu items. If you look at
the menus, you will find quite a few styles can be chosen. In
Figure 1 you can see some of the more common styles&mdash;italics, bold,
centered, or left/right justified, and various font sizes to name a
few.</p><p>Most styles can co-exist peacefully&mdash;italics and bold make
bold-italics. Others cancel each other out&mdash;like center and
right-justify text. Some styles you can apply more than
once&mdash;changing font sizes can be done by successive applications of
bigger. To remove a style, select and area and chose the Plainer
(F7) menu item. To remove all styles, choose the Plainest (F8) menu
item. You can see what styles have been applied by placing the
cursor at some point in your document and then entering &ldquo;Esc-s&rdquo;
(press the escape key and then press the &ldquo;s&rdquo; key). In the message
area at the bottom of the screen you will see a description of the
styles that apply at that point.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246c580.0x25653c8"></a>Insets</h2></div></div><p>In Figure 1 you can see our document has two types of
data&mdash;conventional text and a small picture. Tech-nically each of
these are insets to ez. An inset is just a piece of data (an
object) that has been inserted within some other data (other
object). An inset behaves exactly as if it were a separate
document. The only difference is that it may not have
scrollbars.</p><p><a href="2786f3.jpg" target="_self">Figure 3. Sample Footnote and Header
Insets</a></p><p>ez can be configured so that when a file is to be created, a
certain inset will be the default. For instance, if you invoke ez
on a file called test.d or test.doc, the menus will contain the
text inset with menu items you need for writing a paper like this
one. Of course, once the file has been created, ez will
automatically use the insets indicated by the data itself.
Similarly, editing a file called test.ras results in the raster
inset being created. Editing test.html results in an html inset
being created.</p><p>To create a new inset in a text document, move the cursor to
where you want the inset to exist and select an item from the
&ldquo;Media&rdquo; menu (or press Esc-Tab). In Figure 1, I selected the
&ldquo;raster&rdquo; inset. The causes a raster object to be created, initially
appearing as an empty box. Many insets (but not all) allow other
insets to be embedded in them. After adding a raster inset, you are
editing two documents&mdash;each with different attributes. Which
&ldquo;editor&rdquo; (object) has control is based on where the cursor is
positioned. In this example if you click in the raster box, the
menu cards will change to those of the raster program. Click in the
text area outside the box and the text menus return.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246c580.0x2565630"></a>Page Breaks, Footnotes and Headers</h2></div></div><p>Some insets have special meaning for the formatting of the
text document. They generally have their own menus. If you select
the &ldquo;Insert Pagebreak&rdquo; menu item, a thin horizontal line appears on
the screen. This causes a new page to begin when the document is
printed or previewed.</p><p>Footnotes can be added to your document with the &ldquo;Insert
Footnote&rdquo; menu item. The footnote will appear as a small square
with a star in it. Footnotes can be open or closed by simply
clicking in the box. They are displayed in-line as shown in Figure
3, but print at the bottom of the page, as you would normally
expect.</p><p>A page header or footer can be specified for your document by
inserting the Header/Footer inset on the Media menu card. As shown
in Figure 3, you can specify various fields. There are special
$-keywords you can use for variable data. Select the AUIS Help menu
and then select Show Help On... When prompted, enter headers to get
more detail on headers. Alternatively, you may enter auishelp
headers in an xterm window.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246c580.0x25657e8"></a>Having It Your Way with Styles</h2></div></div><p>The list of styles that come with ez is usually sufficient
for simple documents. However, you may need better control of tab
stops, paragraph indenting or outdenting, or double spaced lines.
Perhaps you want your own combination style that sets the margins,
font, point size all from a single menu item. All this and more can
be done by selecting the &ldquo;Edit Styles&rdquo; menu option. This brings up
a second window which is divided into several panels, as shown in
Figure 4.</p><p><a href="2786f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4. Edit
Styles Window</b></span></a></p><p>The style editor window has its own menus. The top part of
the window, above the double line, is used to select a style to
edit. The left-hand panel is a list of all the menu cards that have
style options. If you select a menu card name, it is highlighted
and its list of styles appears in the right-hand panel. Once you
select a menu card and style name, the rest of the panel becomes
active. It displays the attributes that apply to the selected
style.</p><p>To change the attributes of a style, highlight the different
options in the attribute panels. The document will not change until
the document is redrawn. You can select &ldquo;Update Document&rdquo; to force
the redraw.</p><p>Choose the menu item &ldquo;Add Style&rdquo; to create your own style.
When you do this you are prompted in the message area at the bottom
of the screen for a menu name. You should enter a pair of names
like &ldquo;<span   class="bold"><b>Region,MyWay</b></span>&rdquo;. This will add
a menu item &ldquo;MyWay&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Region&rdquo; menu. You should then select
the attributes you want for this new MyWay style.</p><p>When you edit or add styles with the style editor, the
changes only affect the document you are currently editing. They
are saved in the data and will exist when you edit the document
later. If you copy text containing the new style and paste it in a
new document, the style will be transferred to the new document,
but the attributes of that style will not be transferred. This is
because the attributes of the style are saved at the top of the
file in an area you cannot see. So when you copy the selected area,
you only get the name of the style, but not the definition of the
style (which you cannot see). You will need to either add a new
MyWay style to the second document or learn about templates.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246c580.0x2565bb0"></a>Templates</h2></div></div><p>A template is a set of ready-made formatting information or
instructions that you can apply to a text document. Templates
describe two types of information:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Style specifications, which determine what
formatting styles (such as boldface and centering) can be applied
to a document, and exactly how they change the appearance of the
text to which you apply them. Thus templates lend a standard
appearance to documents by making a style always look the
same.</p></li><li><p>Set text, which is text that you want to include
over and over in many documents. A template saves you time in this
case because you only have to type that text once. ez gives you an
extensive set of templates. Most of these include style
specifications only, but some also include set text (e.g., the
template used for creating memos). Creating a template is described
in detail in the on-line help (enter the command auishelp templates
in an xterm window).</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246c580.0x295e0c0"></a>Printing and Previewing</h2></div></div><p>The entire AUIS system is designed to print using PostScript.
This was a decision made many years ago and is still in transition.
In this version AUIS objects all generate troff output&mdash;along with
copious amounts of embedded PostScript. The troff is then processed
to generate the necessary PostScript. In the auis63L0-wp
distribution the default print command will invoke a shell,
/usr/andrew/etc/atkprint. The default preview command calls the
shell /usr/andrew/etc/ atkpreview. Each of these shells will invoke
the groff formatter to generate the PostScript output. In
atkpreview the groff output is piped into ghostview.</p><p>If you do not have a PostScript printer, you can modify
atkprint to pipe the PostScript output through ghostscript to
generate the correct stream for your printer. Andreas Klemm
<a href="mailto:andreas@knobel.knirsch.de">andreas@knobel.knirsch.de</a>
has written a filter, apsfilter (available from ftp. germany.eu.net
in /pub/comp/i386/Linux/Local. EUnet/People/akl/apsfilter*), which
works with your /etc/printcap entry and will automatically convert
PostScript into the correct DeskJet stream. I have a DeskJet 500
printer which works very well in this mode.</p><p>There are other ways to control printing/previewing by AUIS.
These will be discussed in a future article about tailoring your
AUIS applications.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246c580.0x295e2d0"></a>For More Information</h2></div></div><p>A mailing list is available at
