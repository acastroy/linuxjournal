(PBBS) version 1.6 to ESIX/System V. Pirates BBS was written by Ed
Luke at Mississippi State University in the summer of 1989, and
earned its place in Internet legend through the now-defunct Mars
Hotel BBS. Two friends from high school, then students at the
University of Southern Mississippi (which is my alma mater as
well), generated enough interest in an Internet BBS to get space on
a machine in the Computer Science Department. Together we ported
Pirates, which was strictly BSD code at the time, to ESIX. The
Eagle's Nest BBS was born April 14, 1992.</p><p>It wasn't easy or pretty, as any early user of the Eagle's
Nest will tell you, but it eventually worked. Along the way I added
a lot of features from other BBSes that Pirates 1.6 didn't have,
brought in things from later Pirates revisions, and even had a few
original ideas. It wasn't meant to be anything but a simple PBBS
port, but people started taking an interest in our &ldquo;enhanced
Pirates&rdquo;, so we gave it our own name&mdash;Eagles BBS&mdash;in honor of the
Eagle's Nest, and of our school's mascot from which that name is
derived.</p><p>We released Eagles BBS 1.0 in August 1992, and I've updated
it four times since then. My partners have since dropped out of the
project. Thanks to a lot of gracious folks across the Net, I
received ports of it to quite a few other operating systems. None
of these received more than casual attention, until we discovered
Linux. Before I get into that, I should give a little technical
information about the software itself.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2965580.0x2a5d608"></a>What is Eagles BBS?</h2></div></div><p>Eagles BBS is a self-contained, multifunction bulletin board
package that is accessed by logging in to a special account, either
through telnet, dial-in, or a terminal. Three executables comprise
the EBBS system: bbsrf, bbs, and bbs.chatd.</p><p>bbsrf is a special setuid root login shell. A user &ldquo;bbs&rdquo; is
placed in /etc/passwd with bbsrf as its login shell. bbsrf
optionally erases the login from /etc/utmp, making it invisible to
the &ldquo;finger&rdquo; and &ldquo;who&rdquo; commands. It then does a chroot to the bbs
home directory, does a setuid back to &ldquo;bbs&rdquo;, and execs the bbs
program.</p><p>The chroot is done for security purposes. With it, anyone who
might break out of the bbs program into a shell will only have
access to the bbs home directory, not the rest of the host system.
Because of the chroot, the BBS is completely self-contained
underneath the bbs account's home directory, except for the record
in /etc/passwd. All files needed by the BBS at run time are copied
under ~bbs; for example the /etc/termcap file is copied to
~bbs/etc, the shared C library is copied to ~bbs/lib, and so on.
This is a major portability headache. More on this later.</p><p>The bbs program does most of the work. First it prompts the
user for a userid and password, which are validated by a lookup in
the ~bbs/.PASSWDS file. This is much like how the standard system
login program works, except ~bbs/.PASSWDS is a binary file. Once
logged in, the user navigates through a series of menus accessing
the features of the BBS.</p><p>The menu system is full-screen, and uses the terminal
capability database (~bbs/etc/termcap) for efficient manipulation
of the terminal. EBBS does not use</p><p>libcurses but a stripped-down, simplified curses look-alike
dating from the Pirates days. Because the user is usually coming in
through telnet, the BBS cannot always tell what terminal type the
user has; there is a menu option for the user to specify this,
however. The menu system is hierarchical; from the top level Main
Menu one can access submenus, such as the Talk Menu, Xyz Menu, File
Menu, and Mail Menu. The functions available from the menus can be
roughly divided into seven categories, which I'll briefly
describe:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Sending/reading mail: Mail may be sent to other
users of the BBS. In addition, a facility for forwarding BBS mail
(and posts) to a remote Internet mailbox is included. Receiving
mail from Internet is not supported; since users do not have real
accounts insofar as the operating system is concerned, this would
be a little tricky.</p></li><li><p>Posting/reading messages: Up to 80 boards may be
set up by the operator on which users may post public messages. The
operator may restrict boards to certain groups of users with
permission masks. The BBS boards do not interface with outside
message services like Usenet or Fido.</p></li><li><p>File upload/download: The BBS has a facility for
file uploading and downloading with serial-line protocols like
Zmodem and Kermit, allowing files to be transferred straight from
home computers to the BBS. Using these protocols across a slow
Internet link usually does not work very well, however. Most sites
also offer ftp access to their file bases since it's more suited to
long-distance network transfers.</p></li><li><p>Talk: An emulation of the Unix &ldquo;talk&rdquo; utility is
available, allowing one-on-one talk sessions with other BBS users.
The talk facility does not allow connections to remote systems like
Unix talk does.</p></li><li><p>Chat: A local chat system is built into the BBS. Up
to four separate rooms may be configured. A chat daemon (bbs.chatd,
the third program making up the BBS) process is spawned when the
first user enters a room, and serves to relay messages to all users
in the room. A number of IRC-like features have been hacked into
the chat facility, like private messages, actions, and commands to
show who's logged on.</p></li><li><p>User utilities: For setting things like your
nickname (not login userid), terminal type, and address for
mail/post forwarding. These are on the Xyz Menu.</p></li><li><p>Administrator utilities: These are only accessible
by privileged users. This includes things like account and board
creation and removal, setting permission flags on accounts, mail
cleans, and welcome screen editing.</p></li></ol></div><p>As you can see, EBBS, like its Pirates predecessor, stands on
its own for the most part&mdash;hooks to other services are few and far
between. Much of this is necessary because of the chroot. Some
sites have integrated Internet Relay Chat clients into their BBSes,
but even then the built-in chat system is quite popular. EBBS seems
to be popular among computing neophytes because of the simple menu
system and builtin editor. On the same token, power users sometimes
get frustrated by its limitations.</p><p>The isolated nature of a PBBS or EBBS system encourages some
interesting relationships among its regular users, especially after
a system has been around for a while. Some of the things that go on
would surprise even the most ardent soap opera fan! I'll leave that
topic open for another article, though.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2965580.0x2a5dea0"></a>Enter Linux</h2></div></div><p>Back at the Eagle's Nest, in late 1993, the decision was made
to switch its host machine (a 1990 vintage 25 MHz Cheetah Gold 486
PC) from ESIX to Linux, because Linux simply had more to offer. So,
I was called upon to do another port. This was the kick in the
pants I needed to finally buy a new hard disk and put a real
operating system on my own PC. Armed with the 0.99.12 kernel and
SLS 1.03 distribution, I tackled the task before me, and found it
to be quite easy to go from my System V Release 4 ported code to
Linux. Here is a list of the issues I ran up against, which should
make an initial &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo; list for anyone porting a network
application to Linux. You'll notice many of the same things
mentioned in Michael K. Johnson's excellent &ldquo;Porting To Linux&rdquo;
article in <i  >Linux Journal</i>, Vol. 1 Edition 1.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Signal handling. BSD, and SVR4 via the signal(2)
call, have restartable signals. In Linux you must explicitly ask
for BSD signal handling or use the somewhat different sigaction
interface. [Editor's Note: See the last section of Linux
Programming Hints on page 33.] For me, it was just easier to change
the code to assume signal handlers need to be reset.</p></li><li><p>select(2) and the timeout parameter. Like so many
apps, EBBS assumed that select(2) leaves the contents of the
timeval struct alone. You've got to reset the timeout if you're
calling select in a loop.</p></li><li><p>the FD_SET macro and its kin live in
&lt;sys/time.h&gt;. Not that this should bog down anyone's porting,
but it's worth mentioning since most Unixes put these macros in
&lt;sys/types.h&gt; or &lt;sys/select.h&gt;.</p></li><li><p>Terminal I/O. A lot of BSD source relies on gtty(2)
and stty(2) and obscure ioctl flags. When I realized they weren't
in the base C library, I changed it all over to termio. Probably a
good idea anyway, even if I did have to put the BSD source from
PBBS back for the NeXT port.</p></li></ul></div><p>The Eagle's Nest went online with Linux in October 1993 and
we've been faithfully keeping step with the latest revisions ever
since. Compared to our experience running on ESIX, Linux has been
both good and bad.</p><p>The good: the ext2 filesystem and kernel proper. Some BBS
operations requiring lots of file access, notably the scan for new
messages and the &ldquo;visit&rdquo; function (to mark all messages as read)
were excruciatingly slow under ESIX, but lightning fast under Linux
- with the exact same hardware, of course. A new message scan that
might take ten seconds before will get done in one or two now. All
the buffering Linux does really made a difference for us.</p><p>The bad: the TCP/IP networking. The Eagle's Nest sometimes
gets a couple of hundred logins a day, and it shares bandwidth with
anonymous ftp service and a WWW server. Hence, the kernel gets
battered pretty badly network-wise. Through the releases from 0.99
pl13 to the present 1.1.8, we've seen lots of strange things like
dying inetds, frequent reboots to revive the network, and
connections hanging both on connect and close. Luckily, it keeps
getting better, and as of 1.1.8 the only annoying problem left is
occasional hanging at connect time, and only when it has to deal
with long delays or lost packets. Unfortunately such conditions are
not at all uncommon on Internet.</p><p>That aside, we at the Eagle's Nest are pretty happy with
Linux, and I now use it almost exclusively myself. I have another
operating system on my disk, but it's just a faint memory. Its name
starts with D I think. Doom! Yeah, that's it!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2965580.0x2a5e478"></a>Looking to the Future</h2></div></div><p>As I mentioned already, no port of EBBS has generated
anywhere close to the interest the Linux port has received. The
worldwide scope of Linux is especially evident. Interest in EBBS
for Linux has sprouted on every continent except Antarctica, all
with very little promotion on my part! See sidebar for a partial
list of Linux EBBS systems available on Internet.</p><p>Not too long after the Linux port was done, I decided that
the current code was getting too messy for any more nontrivial
additions or enhancements. Here are a few of the things holding
advancement of the present incarnation of EBBS back:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The chroot. It's a security feature but also a
portability nightmare. Every flavor of Unix requires a different
set of system files under ~bbs to allow the system to work, and
indeed some haven't been figured out yet. It also makes the install
script a big mess. Consider shared libraries. On some systems
they're in /lib, some in /usr/lib, some in /usr/shlib. On some
systems all you need is libc.so.*, on others (like Solaris) you
need a half dozen or more shared libraries. It's a huge mess. In
the latest version (2.2) I have added a compile time option to turn
off the chroot if desired. To get rid of it safely would be even
better.</p></li><li><p>Because of the chroot, it's nearly impossible to
add hooks to the outside system into the BBS. Many BBS operators
have expressed the need for two-way Internet mail and Usenet, and
with the chroot this is impractical if not impossible to do with
EBBS. A few hooks outside the BBS proper have been successfully
done, for example the outgoing mail/post forwarding, and IRC, 4m,
and Gopher clients.</p></li><li><p>Keeping track of read posts, and the .DIR files.
The Pirates BBS way of keeping track of which user has read which
post involves each post having a record in a .DIR file associated
with each board. These records have things like the owner and title
of the post, and one byte for each possible account on the system.
When the user reads the post, their byte in the post's record in
the .DIR is marked as such. The race conditions involved with
simultaneous updates of these files are rampant and tricky to guard
against. Also, since each .DIR record must be a known size, the
numbers of BBS accounts is fixed at compile time, not a desirable
feature.</p></li></ul></div><p>So last November, I embarked on a complete rewrite, with the
goal of keeping all or most of the existing EBBS features but a
completely new foundation. Five months later I'm almost done with
the first cut. The fact that this is a spare-time venture, plus a
couple of rewrites from scratch when I got frustrated, have made it
slow going.</p><p>The development of the new version is being done 100% on
Linux, and I'm making a point to stay as POSIX-compliant as
possible so ports can be done without too much hassle. These are
some of the features under development:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>No more chroot. See above. I am going to get rid of
the Shell Escape menu function for this reason, as it's risky, and
disallow the system(3) C library call anywhere in my code, since it
spawns a shell as well. In short, I'm trying to make it impossible
to break out.</p></li><li><p>Run time configuration, to allow binary
distribution (the Linux way!). Right now, all EBBS optional
features and access permissions must be configured at compile time.
A set of initialization files that the BBS reads at run time will
be a major improvement. In particular I am trying to make
configurable anything that may vary between distributions, such as
the mail program to use for forwarding. In addition, I plan to make
all files used by the BBS ASCII rather than binary, so they may be
easily patched with an editor if something goes awry. This includes
the passwds file and boards file.</p></li><li><p>No more .DIR files. I will be storing the bits
showing which posts/mail a user has read in a per-user config file,
eliminating the need for the .DIR files. And, it eliminates the
restriction on the number of accounts.</p></li><li><p>Separation of the user interface and BBS core, only
interacting via a carefully defined API set. This will allow anyone
who wants to build their own user interface, for example an
X-Windows GUI, to do so easily, with only knowledge of the APIs for
accessing the BBS core functions. I plan to write a network API set
which will allow clients to connect to remote BBS servers via a
yet-undefined TCP/IP-based protocol. This way, things like menu
movements and editing may be done on the client, with none of the
lag that has become all too common on the increasingly crowded
&ldquo;information highway&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p>And a few more features which aren't present now:
group mailing, replies by mail to post authors, per-board managers,
added chat features like private rooms, and more.</p></li></ol></div><p>At the time of this writing, this rewrite is very nearly
ready for initial testing, with only a few features yet to be
added. If all goes well, something will be publicly available by
the time you read this. I'm tentatively calling it Eagles BBS 3.0
and plan to distribute under the GNU copyleft or something similar;
everything is subject to change at this point of course.</p><p>I hope this work culminates in a useful addition to the
already-impressive array of software for Linux. The demand for
Linux bulletin board software is there, it seems. It's been an
enlightening and educational experience for me, however time
consuming. The development environment offered by gcc, gdb, and the
myriad of other tools is as good as any, I think. At first the
documentation left a bit to be desired but that has improved
markedly. I'd like to encourage other programmers to do the same
with their favorite spare-time projects-the Linux community is very
responsive and helpful with everything from suggestions to
development to distribution. I'm proud to be involved with
it.</p><p><a href="2789s1.html" target="_self">Where to Get Eagle
