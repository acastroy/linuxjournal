    Conclusion of an article started last month. While originally
    written by Brian Fox of the Free Software Foundation, bash
    is now maintained by Chet Ramey. In this article, Chet
    explains the history of shells and then goes on to explore
    features specific to bash.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c8580.0x21c03f8"></a>History</h2></div></div><p>Access to the list of commands previously entered (the
command history) is provided jointly by bash and the readline
library. bash provides variables (<b  >$HISTFILE</b>,
<b  >$HISTSIZE</b>, and <b  >$HISTCONTROL</b>)
and the history and fc builtins to manipulate the history list. The
value of <b  >$HISTFILE</b> specifies the file where bash
writes the command history on exit and reads it on startup.
<b  >$HISTSIZE</b> is used to limit the number of
commands saved in the history. <b  >$HISTCONTROL</b>
provides a crude form of control over which commands are saved on
the history list: a value of ignorespace means to not save commands
which begin with a space; a value of ignoredups means to not save
commands identical to the last command saved.
<b  >$HISTCONTROL</b> was named
<b  >$history_control</b> in earlier versions of bash;
the old name is still accepted for backward compatibility. The
history command can read or write files containing the history list
and display the current list contents. The fc builtin, adopted from
POSIX.2 and the Korn Shell, allows display and re-execution, with
optional editing, of commands from the history list. The readline
library offers a set of commands to search the history list for a
portion of the current input line or a string typed by the user.
Finally, the history library, generally incorporated directly into
the readline library, implements a facility for history recall,
expansion, and re-execution of previous commands very similar to
csh (&ldquo;bang history&rdquo;, so called because the exclamation point
introduces a history substitution):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo a b c d e
a b c d e
$ !! f g h i
echo a b c d e f g h i
a b c d e f g h i
$ !-2
echo a b c d e
a b c d e
$ echo !-2:1-4
echo a b c d
a b c d
</pre><p>The command history is only saved when the shell is
interactive, so it is not available for use by shell
scripts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c8580.0x21c0870"></a>New Shell Variables</h2></div></div><p>There are a number of convenience variables that bash
interprets to make life easier. These include
<b  >FIGNORE</b>, which is a set of filename suffixes
identifying files to exclude when completing filenames;
<b  >HOSTTYPE</b>, which is automatically set to a string
describing the type of hardware on which bash is currently
executing; <b  >command_oriented_history</b>, which
directs bash to save all lines of a multiple-line command such as a
while or for loop in a single history entry, allowing easy
re-editing; and <b  >IGNOREEOF</b>, whose value indicates
the number of consecutive EOF characters that an interactive shell
will read before exiting&mdash;an easy way to keep yourself from being
logged out accidentally. The auto_resume variable alters the way
the shell treats simple command names: if job control is active,
and this variable is set, single-word simple commands without
redirections cause the shell to first look for and restart a
suspended job with that name before starting a new process.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c8580.0x21c0ad8"></a>Brace Expansion</h2></div></div><p>Since sh offers no convenient way to generate arbitrary
strings that share a common prefix or suffix (pathname expansion
requires that the filenames exist), bash implements brace
expansion, a capability picked up from csh. Brace expansion is
similar to pathname expansion, but the strings generated need not
correspond to existing files. A brace expression consists of an
optional preamble, followed by a pair of braces enclosing a series
of comma-separated strings, and an optional postamble. The preamble
is prepended to each string within the braces, and the postamble is
then appended to each resulting string:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo a{d,c,b}e
ade ace abe
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c8580.0x21c0c38"></a>Process Substitution</h2></div></div><p>On systems that can support it, bash provides a facility
known as process substitution. Process substitution is similar to
command substitution in that its specification includes a command
to execute, but the shell does not collect the command's output and
insert it into the command line. Rather, bash opens a pipe to the
command, which is run in the background. The shell uses named pipes
(FIFOs) or the /dev/fd method of naming open files to expand the
process substitution to a filename which connects to the pipe when
opened. This filename becomes the result of the expansion. Process
substitution can be used to compare the outputs of two different
versions of an application as part of a regression test:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cmp &lt;\&gt;(old_prog) &lt;(new_prog)
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c8580.0x21c0d98"></a>Prompt Customization</h2></div></div><p>One of the more popular interactive features that bash
provides is the ability to customize the prompt. Both
<b  >$PS1</b> and <b  >$PS2</b>, the primary
and secondary prompts, are expanded before being displayed.
Parameter and variable expansion is performed when the prompt
string is expanded, so any shell variable can be put into the
prompt (e.g., $SHLVL, which indicates how deeply the current shell
is nested). bash specially interprets characters in the prompt
string preceded by a backslash. Some of these backslash escapes are
replaced with the current time, the date, the current working
directory, the username, and the command number or history number
of the command being entered. There is even a backslash escape to
cause the shell to change its prompt when running as root by using
the su command. Before printing each primary prompt, bash expands
the variable <b  >$PROMPT_COMMAND</b> and, if it has a
value, executes the expanded value as a command, allowing
additional prompt customization. For example, this assignment
causes the current user, the current host, the time, the last
component of the current working directory, the level of shell
nesting, and the history number of the current command to be
embedded into the primary prompt:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ PS1='\u@\h [     ] \W($SHLVL:\!)\$ `
chet@odin [21:03:44] documentation(2:636)$ cd ..
chet@odin [21:03:54] src(2:637)$
</pre><p>The string being assigned is surrounded by single quotes so
that if it is exported, the value of <b  >$SHLVL</b> will
be updated by a child shell:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chet@odin [21:17:35] src(2:638)$ export PS1
chet@odin [21:17:40] src(2:639)$ bash
chet@odin [21:17:46] src(3:696)$
</pre><p>The \$ escape is displayed as &ldquo;$&rdquo; when running as a normal
user, but as &ldquo;#&rdquo; when running as root.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c8580.0x21c1160"></a>File System Views</h2></div></div><p>Since Berkeley introduced symbolic links in 4.2 BSD, one of
their most annoying properties has been the &ldquo;warping&rdquo; to a
completely different area of the file system when using cd, and the
resultant non-intuitive behavior of &ldquo;cd ..&rdquo;. The Unix kernel treats
symbolic links physically. When the kernel is translating a
pathname in which one component is a symbolic link, it replaces all
or part of the pathname while processing the link. If the contents
of the symbolic link begin with a slash, the kernel replaces the
pathname entirely; if not, the link contents replace the current
component. In either case, the symbolic link is visible. If the
link value is an absolute pathname, the user finds himself in a
completely different part of the file system.</p><p>bash provides a logical view of the file system. In this
default mode, command and filename completion and builtin commands
such as cd and pushd which change the current working directory
transparently follow symbolic links as if they were directories.
The $PWD variable, which holds the shell's idea of the current
working directory, depends on the path used to reach the directory
rather than its physical location in the local file system
hierarchy. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd /usr/local/bin
$ echo $PWD
/usr/local/bin
$ pwd
/usr/local/bin
$ /bin/pwd
/net/share/sun4/local/bin
$ cd ..
$ pwd
/usr/local
$ /bin/pwd
/net/share/sun4/local
</pre><p>One problem with this, of course, arises when programs that
do not understand the shell's logical notion of the file system
interpret &ldquo;..&rdquo; differently. This generally happens when bash
completes filenames containing &ldquo;..&rdquo; according to a logical
hierarchy which does not correspond to their physical location. For
users who find this troublesome, a corresponding physical view of
the file system is available:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd /usr/local/bin
$ pwd
/usr/local/bin
$ set -o physical
$ pwd
/net/share/sun4/local/bin
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c8580.0x21c13c8"></a>Internationalization</h2></div></div><p>One of the most significant improvements in version 1.13 of
bash was the change to &ldquo;eight-bit cleanliness&rdquo;. Previous versions
used the eighth bit of characters to mark whether or not they were
quoted when performing word expansions. While this did not affect
the majority of users, most of whom used only seven-bit ASCII
characters, some found it confining. Beginning with version 1.13,
bash implemented a different quoting mechanism that did not alter
the eighth bit of characters. This allowed bash to manipulate files
with &ldquo;odd&rdquo; characters in their names, but did nothing to help users
enter those names, so version 1.13 introduced changes to readline
that made it eight-bit clean as well. Options exist that force
readline to attach no special significance to characters with the
eighth bit set (the default behavior is to convert these characters
to meta-prefixed key sequences) and to output these characters
without conversion to meta-prefixed sequences. These changes, along
with the expansion of keymaps to a full eight bits, enable readline
to work with most of the ISO-8859 family of character sets, used by
many European countries.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c8580.0x21c14d0"></a>POSIX Mode</h2></div></div><p>Although bash is intended to be POSIX.2 conformant, there are
areas in which the default behavior is not compatible with the
standard. For users who wish to operate in a strict POSIX.2
environment, bash implements a POSIX mode. When this mode is
active, bash modifies its default operation where it differs from
POSIX.2 to match the standard. POSIX mode is entered when bash is
started with the &ldquo;-o posix&rdquo; option or when set -o posix is
executed. For compatibility with other GNU software that attempts
to be POSIX.2 compliant, bash also enters POSIX mode if either of
the variables $POSIX_PEDANTIC or $POSIXLY_CORRECT is set when bash
is started or assigned a value during execution. When bash is
started in POSIX mode, for example, it sources the file named by
the value of $ENV rather than the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; startup files.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c8580.0x21c15d8"></a>Future Plans</h2></div></div><p>There are several features that will be introduced in the
next version of bash, version 1.14, and a number under
consideration for future releases. This section will briefly detail
the new features planned for version 1.14 and describe features
that may appear in later versions.</p><p>The new features available in bash-1.14 answer several of the
most common requests for enhancements. Most notably, there is a
mechanism for including non-visible character sequences in prompts,
such as those which cause a terminal to print characters in
different colors or in standout mode. There was nothing preventing
the use of these sequences in earlier versions, but the readline
redisplay algorithm assumed each character occupied physical screen
space and would wrap lines prematurely.</p><p>Readline has a few new variables, several new bindable
commands, and some additional emacs mode default key bindings. A
new history search mode has been implemented: in this mode,
readline searches the history for lines beginning with the
characters between the beginning of the current line and the
cursor. The existing readline incremental search commands no longer
match identical lines more than once. Filename completion now
expands variables in directory names. The history expansion
facilities are now nearly completely csh-compatible: missing
modifiers have been added and history substitution has been
extended.</p><p>Several of the features described earlier as appearing in
future releases, such as set -o posix and $POSIX_PEDANTIC, are
present in version 1.14. There is a new shell variable, OSTYPE, to
which bash assigns a value that identifies the version of Unix it's
running on (great for putting architecture-specific binary
directories into the $PATH). Two variables have been renamed:
$HISTCONTROL replaces $history_control , and $HOSTFILE replaces
$hostname_completion_file. In both cases, the old names are
accepted for backward compatibility. The ksh select construct,
which allows the generation of simple menus, has been implemented.
New capabilities have been added to existing variables:
$auto_resume can now take values of exact or substring, and
$HISTCONTROL understands the value ignoreboth, which combines the
two previously acceptable values. The dirs builtin has acquired
options to print out specific members of the directory stack. The
$nolinks variable, which forces a physical view of the file system,
has been superseded by the -P option to the set builtin (equivalent
to set -o physical); the variable is retained for backward
compatibility. The version string contained in $BASH_VERSION now
includes an indication of the patch level as well as the &ldquo;build
version&rdquo;. Some little-used features have been removed: the bye
synonym for exit and the $NO_PROMPT_VARS variable are gone. There
is now an organized test suite that can be run as a regression test
when building a new version of bash.</p><p>The documentation has been thoroughly overhauled: there is a
new manual page on the readline library and the info file has been
updated to reflect the current version. As always, as many bugs as
possible have been fixed, although some surely remain.</p><p>There are a few features that I hope to include in later bash
releases. Some are based on work already done in other
shells.</p><p>In addition to simple variables, a future release of bash
will include one-dimensional arrays, using the ksh implementation
of arrays as a model. Additions to the ksh syntax, such as
varname=( ... ) to assign a list of words directly to an array and
a mechanism to allow the read builtin to read a list of values
directly into an array, would be desirable. Given those extensions,
the ksh</p><p>&ldquo;set -A&rdquo; syntax may not be worth supporting (the -A option
assigns a list of values to an array, but is a rather peculiar
special case).</p><p>Some shells include a means of programmable word completion,
where the user specifies on a per-command basis how the arguments
of the command are to be treated when completion is attempted: as
filenames, hostnames, executable files, and so on. The other
aspects of the current bash implementation could remain as-is; the
existing heuristics would still be valid. Only when completing the
arguments to a simple command would the programmable completion be
in effect.</p><p>It would also be nice to give the user finer-grained control
over which commands are saved onto the history list. One proposal
is for a variable, tentatively named HISTIGNORE, which would
contain a colon-separated list of commands. Lines beginning with
these commands, after the restrictions of $HISTCONTROL have been
applied, would not be placed onto the history list. The shell
pattern-matching capabilities could also be available when
specifying the contents of $HISTIGNORE.</p><p>One thing that newer shells such as wksh (also known as
dtksh) provide is a command to dynamically load code implementing
additional builtin commands into a running shell. This new builtin
would take an object file or shared library implementing the &ldquo;body&rdquo;
of the builtin (xxx_builtin() for those familiar with bash
internals) and a structure containing the name of the new command,
the function to call when the new builtin is invoked (presumably
defined in the shared object specified as an argument), and the
documentation to be printed by the help command (possibly present
in the shared object as well). It would manage the details of
extending the internal table of builtins.</p><p>A few other builtins would also be desirable: two are the
POSIX.2 getconf command, which prints the values of system
configuration variables defined by POSIX.2, and a disown builtin,
which causes a shell running with job control active to &ldquo;forget
about&rdquo; one or more background jobs in its internal jobs table.
Using getconf, for example, a user could retrieve a value for $PATH
guaranteed to find all of the POSIX standard utilities, or find out
how long filenames may be in the file system containing a specified
directory.</p><p>There are no implementation timetables for any of these
features, nor are there concrete plans to include them. If anyone
has comments on these proposals, feel free to send me electronic
mail.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c8580.0x21c1b00"></a>Reflections and Lessons Learned</h2></div></div><p>The lesson that has been repeated most often during bash
development is that there are dark corners in the Bourne Shell, and
people use all of them. In the original description of the Bourne
shell, quoting and the shell grammar are both poorly specified and
incomplete; subsequent descriptions have not helped much. The
grammar presented in Bourne's paper describing the shell
distributed with the Seventh Edition of Unix is so far off that it
does not allow the command who|wc. In fact, as Tom Duff
states:</p><p>&ldquo;Nobody really knows what the Bourne shell's grammar is. Even
examination of the source code is little help.&rdquo;1</p><p>The POSIX.2 standard includes a yacc grammar that comes close
to capturing the Bourne shell's behavior, but it disallows some
constructs which sh accepts without complaint-and there are scripts
out there that use them. It took a few versions and several bug
reports before bash implemented sh-compatible quoting, and there
are still some &ldquo;legal&rdquo; sh constructs which bash flags as syntax
errors. Complete sh compatibility is a tough nut.</p><p>The shell is bigger and slower than I would like, though the
current version is faster than previously.</p><p>The readline library could stand a substantial
rewrite.</p><p>A hand-written parser to replace the current yacc-gener-ated
one would probably result in a speedup, and would solve one glaring
problem: the shell could parse commands in &ldquo;$(...)&rdquo; constructs as
they are entered, rather than reporting errors when the construct
is expanded.</p><p>As always, there is some chaff to go with the wheat. Areas of
duplicated functionality need to be cleaned up. There are several
cases where bash treats a variable specially to enable
functionality available another way ($notify vs. set -o notify and
$nolinks vs.</p><p>set -o physical, for instance); the special treatment of the
variable name should probably be removed. A few more things could
stand removal; the $allow_null_ glob_expansion and
$glob_dot_filenames variables are of particularly questionable
value. The $[...] arithmetic evaluation syntax is redundant now
that the POSIX-mandated $((...)) construct has been implemented,
and could be deleted. It would be nice if the text output by the
help builtin were external to the shell rather than compiled into
it. The behavior enabled by $command_oriented_history, which causes
the shell to attempt to save all lines of a multi-line command in a
single history entry, should be made the default and the variable
removed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c8580.0x21b8700"></a>Availability</h2></div></div><p>As with all other GNU software, bash is available for
anonymous FTP from prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu and from other GNU
software mirror sites. The current version is in bash-1.13.5.tar.gz
in that directory. Use archie to find the nearest archive site. The
latest version is always available for FTP from bash.CWRU.Edu:/pub/
dist. bash documentation is available for FTP from
bash.CWRU.Edu:/pub/bash.</p><p>The Free Software Foundation sells tapes and CD-ROMs
containing bash; send electronic mail to
<a href="mailto:gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu">gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</a>
or call +1-617-876-3296 for more information. bash is also
distributed with several versions of Unix-compatible systems. It is
included as /bin/sh and /bin/bash on several Linux distributions
and as contributed software in BSDI's BSD/386 and FreeBSD.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c8580.0x21b88b8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>bash is a worthy successor to sh. It is sufficiently portable
to run on nearly every version of Unix from 4.3 BSD to SVR4.2, and
several Unix workalikes. It is robust enough to replace sh on most
of those systems, and provides more functionality. It has several
thousand regular users, and their feedback has helped to make it as
good as it is today-a testament to the benefits of free
software.</p><p>1 Tom Duff, &ldquo;Rc-A Shell for Plan 9 and UNIX systems&rdquo;, Proc.
