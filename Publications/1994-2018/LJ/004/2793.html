    Multimedia has received a lot of attention in the computer
    industry recently. Unix systems traditionally have not
    provided much support for multimedia in general, and sound
    in particular, except for some expensive professional
    systems. Workstation vendors are now scrambling to introduce
    multimedia-ready systems.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b07580.0x1bff450"></a></h2></div></div><p>With the availability of Linux and
low-cost sound hardware for Intel-based PCs, a sound-capable Unix
system is within the reach of most computer hobbyists.
</p><p>Possibly because sound support was lacking in Unix systems,
many new users are confused by the technical jargon specific to
sound and electronic music, and the many sound cards available.
This article will to explain what can be done with sound under
Linux, unravel some of the technical terms, and point the reader to
sources of more information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b07580.0x1bff5b0"></a>What can a Sound Card do?</h2></div></div><p>The typical sound card hardware provides the capability for
one or more of the following functions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>playing and recording digitized sound
samples</p></li><li><p>playing music from an audio Compact Disc in a
CD-ROM drive</p></li><li><p>generating sounds using an internal FM
synthesizer</p></li><li><p>controlling external MIDI (Musical Instrument
Digital Interface) devices</p></li><li><p>miscellaneous functions, such as providing a
joystick interface, SCSI disk interface, volume and tone controls,
and facilities for mixing of inputs</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b07580.0x1bffa80"></a>Different Types of Sound Cards</h2></div></div><p>For digitized sounds, there are two basic parameters that
determine the sound quality: sampling rate and sample size.</p><p>The sampling rate is the speed at which the analog waveform
is converted to digital &ldquo;samples&rdquo;. This is expressed in samples per
second, or more often (and less accurately), Hertz. The sample size
indicates the number of data bits which are stored for each sample;
the more bits, the more accurately the sample represents the
original waveform. Sounds can also be recorded with one channel
(mono) or two channels (stereo). Various coding schemes are used to
represent the sample as a numerical value.</p><p>As an example, a low-cost sound card can produce single
channel, 8-bit samples at 8000 samples per second. This provides
sound quality comparable to the telephone network. A 16-bit sound
card producing stereo sound at 44100 samples/second is equivalent
to Compact Disc audio quality (ignoring issues such as noise and
distortion).</p><p>Some sound cards also provide hardware for producing sounds
using FM synthesis. This technique is based on modifying sine
waves. The advantage of this scheme is that the hardware is
reasonably simple and not much computing power is required. The
disadvantage is that it is difficult to determine the parameters
needed to produce specific sounds (e.g., a piano).</p><p>Sound cards also typically provide other miscellaneous
features, including joystick ports, CD-ROM interface, SCSI
interface, MIDI port, facilities for sound input and output, and
volume and tone controls.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b07580.0x1bffce8"></a>Supported Sound Cards</h2></div></div><p>The Linux kernel currently supports the following sound
cards:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Roland MPU-401 MIDI interface</p></li><li><p>AdLib</p></li><li><p>SoundBlaster and compatibles (including
ThunderBoard and Ati Stereo F/X)</p></li><li><p>SoundBlaster Pro</p></li><li><p>SoundBlaster 16</p></li><li><p>ProAudioSpectrum 16</p></li><li><p>Gravis UltraSound</p></li></ul></div><p>The Linux kernel also supports the SCSI port provided on some
sound cards (e.g., ProAudioSpectrum 16) and the CD-ROM interface
provided on the Soundblaster Pro and SoundBlaster 16.</p><p>For those who do not (yet) have sound hardware, there are a
couple of other options. With a little hardware, a sound interface
can be built using the parallel printer port. For a zero-cost
solution, there is even a sound driver for the internal speaker of
your PC. The driver is compatible with the sound card driver, but
the quality may leave something to be desired.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b07580.0x1c003c8"></a>Configuring Linux for Sound</h2></div></div><p>Setting up Linux to support a sound card involves the
following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>installing the sound card</p></li><li><p>configuring and building the kernel with the sound
drivers</p></li><li><p>creating the sound device files</p></li><li><p>testing the installation</p></li></ol></div><p>The first requirement, if you have not already done so, is to
install the sound card. Follow the instructions provided by the
manufacturer. Be sure to note down the jumper settings for IRQ, DMA
channel, and so on; if you are unsure, use the factory defaults.
Try to avoid conflicts with other devices (e.g., Ethernet cards) if
possible. You will also need speakers, and a microphone if you want
to do any recording. A math co-processor is also useful for some
sound applications (e.g., changing file formats, adding effects or
speech synthesis), but not necessary.</p><p>The next step is to configure the Linux kernel. If you are
using a recent version (0.99 patch level 14 or later), the sound
drivers are included with the kernel release. Follow your usual
procedure for building the kernel. When you configure the kernel,
enable the sound driver, and answer the questions about sound card
settings when prompted by the configure program.</p><p>Once the kernel is configured, you need to create the sound
device files. The easiest way to do this is to cut the short shell
script from the end of the file
/usr/src/linux/drivers/sound/Readme.linux, and run it as root.
These are the files that will be created:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>/dev/audio- Sun workstation compatible audio device
(read/write)</p></li><li><p>/dev/dsp- digital sampling device
(read/write)</p></li><li><p>/dev/mixer- sound mixer</p></li><li><p>/dev/sequencer- MIDI, FM, and GUS synthesizer
access</p></li><li><p>/dev/midi- MIDI device (not yet implemented in
current sound driver)</p></li><li><p>/dev/sndstat- displays sound driver status when
read</p></li><li><p>/dev/audio1- for second sound card</p></li><li><p>/dev/dsp1- for second sound card</p></li></ul></div><p>If you are using the PC speaker sound driver, then it will
use the following devices:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>/dev/pcaudio- equivalent to /dev/audio</p></li><li><p>/dev/pcsp- equivalent to /dev/dsp</p></li><li><p>/dev/pcmixer- equivalent to /dev/mixer</p></li></ul></div><p>Now that the kernel is configured and the device files
created, you can verify the sound hardware and software. Follow
your usual procedure for installing and rebooting the new kernel.
(Keep the old kernel around in case of problems, of course.) Verify
that sound card is recognized during kernel initialization. You
should see a message such as the following on powerup:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
snd2 &lt;SoundBlaster Pro 3.2&gt; at 0x220 irq 5 drq 1
</pre><pre     class="programlisting">
snd1 &lt;Yamaha OPL-3 FM&gt; at 0x388 irq 0 drq 0
</pre><p>This should match your sound card type and jumper settings.
The driver may also display some error messages and warnings during
boot up. Watch for these when booting the first time after
configuring the sound driver.</p><p>If no sound card is detected when booting, there are a couple
of possible reasons. The configuration of the driver could be
incorrect and the driver was not able to detect your card in the
given I/O address. Another common error is not having the sound
driver in the kernel, because you booted with an old kernel instead
of the one that was just compiled.</p><p>Reading the sound driver status device file provides
additional information on whether the sound card driver initialized
properly. Sample output should look something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% cat /dev/sndstat
Sound Driver:2.4 (Sun Feb 13 14:49:20 EST 1994 root@fizzbin.mitel.com)
Config options: 1aa2
HW config:
Type 2: SoundBlaster at 0x220 irq 5 drq 1
Type 1: AdLib at 0x388 irq 0 drq 0
PCM devices:
0: SoundBlaster Pro 3.2
Synth devices:
0: Yamaha OPL-3
Midi devices:
0: SoundBlaster
Mixer(s) installed
</pre><p>If the cat command displays &ldquo;No such device&rdquo;, then the sound
driver is not active in the kernel. If the printout contains no
devices (PCM, Synth or Midi), then your sound card was not
detected. Verify that you entered the correct information when
configuring the sound driver.</p><p>Now you should be ready to play a sample sound file, and send
it to the sound device as a basic check of sound output, for
example,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% cat endoftheworld &gt;/dev/dsp
% cat crash.au &gt;/dev/audio
</pre><p>Some sample sound files can be obtained from the file
snd-data-0.1.tar.Z, available on many Linux archive sites.</p><p>If you have sound input capability, you can do a quick test
of this using commands such as the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# record 4 seconds of audio from microphone
% dd bs=8k count=4 &lt;/dev/audio &gt;sample.au
# play back sound
% cat sample.au &gt;/dev/audio
</pre><p>If these tests pass, you can be reasonably confident that the
sound hardware and software are working. If you experience
problems, consult one of the references listed at the end of this
article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b07580.0x1bf7ee8"></a>More on Music</h2></div></div><p>When it comes to playing music, there are several methods
that can be used.</p><p>First, don't plan on digitizing a 60 minute music CD as a
sound file and storing it on your hard disk. Some simple
calculations show the size of the data involved:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
     60 minutes
  x 60 secs/minute
  x 44100 samples/second
  x 2 channels
  x 2 bytes/sample
  = more than 635 million bytes!
</pre><p>Small sound samples at low sampling rates are reasonable
though:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    10 seconds
  x 8000 samples/second
  x 1 channel
  x 1 byte/sample
  = 80 thousand bytes
</pre><p>A more compact method of storing music is MOD files. These
originated with the Amiga computer, but MOD file editors and
players are now available on other systems as well, including
Linux. MOD files essentially store a bank of short samples
(instruments), and sequencing information (musical notes). These
files are of the order of 30K to 300K bytes in size and can
represent several minutes of music (i.e. a complete song).</p><p>MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface, and as
the name suggests, is a standard hardware and software protocol for
allowing electronic musical instruments to communicate. MIDI files
describe songs in terms of keypress events, and can be played using
either an internal FM synthesizer on the sound card, or external
MIDI devices.</p><p>Another, less common, file format is Adagio files. Adagio is
a music description language developed at Carnegie Mellon
University. Programs to play Adagio files, and convert between
Adagio and MIDI files are available.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b07580.0x1bf8258"></a>Games</h2></div></div><p>We can't forget another important application for
sound&mdash;games! Several graphical games supporting sound run under
Linux, including Bdash and Xboing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b07580.0x1bf8360"></a>Sound Tools and Utilities</h2></div></div><p>To make use of the sound support in the Linux kernel,
applications are needed. Several of the important ones are Sox (a
utility for converting sound files from one format to another and
adding effects), and tracker (a MOD file player). Some graphical
programs that run under X are available as well, including xmix (a
sound mixer), xplay (a sound player/recorder), and xmp (a MIDI file
player).</p><p>There are many others, including some interesting
applications such as speech synthesis.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b07580.0x1bf84c0"></a>The Future</h2></div></div><p>Now it's time for me to get up on my soapbox. Sound support
in Linux is quite new, and application support is not as complete
as for some other operating systems. I envision seeing a complete
set of sound tools, that would provide a consistent, graphical user
interface for all of the common sound functions. This would help
bring Linux to the forefront of multimedia operating systems. Some
of the tools that need to be developed are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>sound player/recorder tool</p></li><li><p>file conversion utility</p></li><li><p>audio mixer</p></li><li><p>MOD file player</p></li><li><p>MOD file editor</p></li><li><p>MIDI file player and sequencer</p></li><li><p>FM synthesizer patch editor</p></li><li><p>text to speech synthesizer (how about support for a
/dev/speak device?)</p></li><li><p>an X window manager supporting sound</p></li></ul></div><p>Many of these already exist in various forms, and just need
more development to be more reliable and consistent. Any
volunteers?</p><p>An interesting side note is that the author of the Linux
sound drivers, Hannu Savolainen, is porting them to other Intel
operating systems as well. The package has been dubbed VoxWare, and
should make it easier to write sound applications that are portable
across several operating systems.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b07580.0x1bf8d00"></a>Sources of more information</h2></div></div><p>The Linux Sound-HOWTO document provides more information on
the topics discussed in this article and provides other references.
Look for it on your local Linux archive site.</p><p>If you have access to the Internet, the following FAQs
