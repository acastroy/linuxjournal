    Over the past

    be made available on the Internet. This new release will differ in one
    major way yet continue to offer the availability and reliability that
    Slackware has become known for.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10fb580.0x11f3240"></a></h2></div></div><p>As <i  >LJ</i> is just about to go to the printer,
a new version of Slackware [see Patrick Volkerding interview, <i  >LJ</i>
#2] is being released. Over the past few months, Slackware has
become the most popular Linux distribution to be made available on
the Internet. This new release will differ in one major way yet
continue to offer the availability and reliability that Slackware
has become known for.
</p><p>The part that is the same is that Slackware continues to grow
into a file-system-compliant, easy-to-install Linux package that
offers a very large assortment of programs. The main new features
of 2.0 are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Better package installation/removal tools,
including tools to create your own packages.</p></li><li><p>A &ldquo;contrib&rdquo; directory with over 40 MB of extra
packages. Users are encouraged to contribute packages they've put
together.</p></li><li><p>Many more precompiled kernels to support any of the
hardware supported by the standard kernel releases.</p></li><li><p>Integration of the UMSDOS filesystem allowing you
to run Linux on top of an MS-DOS filesystem.</p></li></ul></div><p>The major change is that Pat Volkerding made a deal with
Morse Communications. Morse, by partially funding the development
of Slackware, will get to distribute the &ldquo;official version&rdquo; of
Slackware. I asked Pat why he cut the deal. He said, &ldquo;Mostly
because they asked me first. I've had other inquiries since then
but I'm happy with the decision to let Morse publish it. I think
they'll do a nice job with it.&rdquo;</p><p>Pat went on to say &ldquo;I hadn't planned to join up with a CD
manufacturer in an official sense, but when I thought about it I
decided it would be better for Slackware. Getting some project
funding has allowed me to put more time into it and it will remain
free and available for FTP, of course.&rdquo;</p><p>One other important addition is that Morse will offer 90 days
of free support with the purchase of their Slackware Pro 2.0 Linux
system. It is expected to be available in mid-July.</p></div></div>
