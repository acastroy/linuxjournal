    Wine is not an Emulator, or WINdows Emulator; whichever you
    call it, Wine allows you to run programs compiled for MS
    Windows under Linux, FreeBSD, and NetBSD. In this article,
    Bob Amstadt (the founder of the Wine project) and Michael
    Johnson explain what Wine is and how it works.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13f0580.0x14e83a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>In the first few years of Linux, many
people asked whether it would be possible to run MS Windows under
Linux. They were tired of rebooting over and over to run
applications such as word processors that are available under
Windows, but not under Linux.
</p><p>Since Windows (in some incarnation) runs under SCO, iRTX,
QNX, and SVR4 of various flavors, why couldn't it run under Linux
as well? The immediate answer was that all the other OS's that run
Windows 3.1 have access to some Windows source code, and are
working under &ldquo;non-disclosure agreements&rdquo; from Microsoft, and that
Windows, as it comes out-of-the-box, takes over the entire machine.
It is possible to run Windows 3.0 in &ldquo;real mode&rdquo;, where it doesn't
take over the machine, but very few applications will run in that
mode.</p><p>Others pointed out that most of the other implementations
crash just as often as Windows itself does, and that Linux is a
32-bit operating system, while Windows is a 16-bit system, and that
standard Windows binaries are 16-bit binaries.</p><p>Some people suggested rewriting Windows for Linux and X11,
and then laughed at their own joke.</p><p>Attention turned to the DOS emulator that became widely
useable about a year and a half after Linux's debut. Many were
excited when, with some rather ugly hacks, the DOS emulator was
able to run Windows 3.0 in &ldquo;real mode&rdquo;, at least for a few
developers who knew what they were doing. It became apparent that
there are very few useful Windows applications which still run in
real mode, that it would be very difficult to get Windows to run in
standard mode under Linux, and that if Windows could be made to run
under Linux, it would make the system unstable.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13f0580.0x14e8608"></a>Maybe it's Not a Joke, After All</h2></div></div><p>A year ago or so (in June 1993), Bob Amstadt started writing
the beginnings of Wine. He started by writing the code necessary to
load Windows binaries into memory (Windows binaries are not in a
format Linux understands, and need to be &ldquo;fixed up&rdquo; when they are
run) and some code for Linux to allow modifying some of the memory
management structures (the LDT) in such a way that Windows binaries
could run.</p><p>He set up a structure for rewriting the rest of Windows, and
a few programmers joined him in writing these functions. A year
later, over 35% of the functions have been written, and many small
applications run, more or less. These include the standard Windows
applets Solitaire and Winmine, as well as a commercial security
system application. Each week, more programs are added to the
success list.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13f0580.0x14e8768"></a>What Wine Does</h2></div></div><p>Wine translates the Windows API (Application Programming
Interface, how Windows applications call Windows) into equivalent
functionality available through the standard Unix and X interfaces.
When a Windows program creates a window, Wine converts that into a
call to create a window through the standard Xlib library. When DOS
interrupts are called, for example to read a file, Wine translates
them into Unix system calls.</p><p>Wine also implements other API's that are available for
Windows. For instance, the WinSock API is becoming the standard way
of accessing TCP/IP networking under Windows, and Wine provides the
functionality of WinSock, mapping it to the standard Unix socket
calls.</p><p>Wine should run applications at approximately the same speed
as Windows, because the application code is running on the native
CPU-Wine does not emulate a 386 or 486 processor. Because Wine
itself is a 32-bit application, it has a chance to be faster than
MS Windows in some areas. Windows, by contrast, runs in 16-bit mode
and has to do a lot of &ldquo;segment arithmetic&rdquo; that is not necessary
in 32-bit mode.</p><p>Wine loads Windows binaries; it also loads the closely
related DLLs (dynamically linked libraries) which most applications
require. Wine itself uses a DLL called sysres.dll, in which are
stored all the bitmaps for the standard buttons on the title
bar.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13f0580.0x14e8978"></a>Better Than Better...</h2></div></div><p>OS/2 2.x was marketed as &ldquo;A better Windows than Windows&rdquo;, and
in some ways this was true. OS/2 provides &ldquo;Crash Protection&rdquo;,
whereby one misbehaving Windows application cannot crash another
application. Windows, on the other hand, does not adequately
protect applications from each other. With Wine, each program is
run as a separate process, which utilizes the protection already
provided by the Unix process model, where each process is
separate.</p><p>Not only will you not crash your computer, you will not crash
X either. X is designed to be robust, and to check the data that is
passed to it by applications, so that random bad data will not
cause the X server to crash.</p><p>There are additional benefits beyond &ldquo;crash protection&rdquo; to
running each Window binary as a separate process. One is that each
program has more resources. Instead of all the Windows programs
running at the same time having to share GDI heap (a memory
resource), each program has access to its own entire heap.</p><p>Under Windows, when an application is busy and changes the
cursor to the dreaded hourglass, the user has to wait to use all
the programs currently running on the computer. With Wine, when one
application is busy, the user can let that application be busy
while switching to another application and getting some work
done.</p><p>In Unix, filesystems are &ldquo;multithreaded&rdquo;, which means that
multiple processes may be reading and writing files simultaneously.
DOS does not allow this, so Wine, by using the Unix functionality
for reading and writing files, allows much faster and smoother
access to files, both on the hard drive and on floppies. The user
can back up to any medium and work at the same time, just as you
would expect under Unix.</p><p>Running MS Windows programs on remote computers that are also
running MS Windows is not easy or fun. It requires that special
remote-access programs be running on both computers, and none of
the many remote access programs is compatible with any of the other
programs, because they all use closed, proprietary protocols.
Furthermore, they usually require that the remote user be the sole
user of the machine.</p><p>X, by contrast, is designed to run remotely, and to run on
multi-user systems. Because Wine translates Windows calls into X
calls, Wine allows the same easy remote access that X does. It is
just as simple (although a little slower) for a user in Moscow to
run the Windows application on your computer as it is for you, if
you are on the Internet, and so is she, and you give her an account
on your machine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13f0580.0x14e8c90"></a>How Wine Does It</h2></div></div><p>As mentioned before, Wine is a single process which
translates Windows calls, including undocumented calls that
applications need (and a few DOS int21 calls as well) to X and Unix
calls, respectively. It is also responsible for properly loading
Windows applications. Wine reads the executable file, and correctly
loads the code, data, and resources into memory.</p><p>Wine is a single process which uses only one non-standard
system call, which is required to be able to run 16-bit code
instead of 32-bit code. Therefore, it is relatively simple to port
Wine to operating systems which conform to POSIX (more or less),
have X, and for which the source is free, or which provide an
appropriate alternate non-standard system call for setting up the
LDT so that 16-bit code can run. Wine was originally developed for
Linux, but the port to FreeBSD and NetBSD took less than a
week.</p><p>The most basic window-handling functions in Wine are written
as an interface to the appropriate Xlib functions for manipulating
X windows. However, wherever possible, other internal functions in
Wine call the basic window-handling functions in Wine instead of
Xlib. This has several benefits: it makes Wine more modular, it
makes the basic window-handling functions be better tested, and it
makes it less necessary for every Wine developer to have X
programming expertise.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13f0580.0x14e8e48"></a>Running Wine</h2></div></div><p>Wine can be run like any other X program: you can run it from
the command line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% wine sol
</pre><p>or you can put it in a menu, or launch it from a file
manager. When launched, programs run and act as if they were
running under Windows. By default, applications come up in a
special kind of window that looks very much like those provided by
Windows instead of looking like other X windows. It looks as if a
normal Windows window popped up in the middle of all your X
windows, because your window manager doesn't put a standard &ldquo;frame&rdquo;
on the window. Unfortunately, those windows do not interact well
with virtual window managers like fvwm (they don't go away when you
switch to another virtual screen), so there is an option to bring
up an X window that contains the application window, and this is
well-behaved with virtual window managers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13f0580.0x14e9000"></a>In the Future</h2></div></div><p>Wine is still in ALPHA testing. It only runs a few
applications (other than the test applications that come with it)
at this point, although more are being added rapidly to the list.
At some point, when Wine supports several major applications, it
will be released as BETA software for anyone to play with. However,
the BETA release will most likely be missing several features. DDE
and OLE are not likely to be supported in the BETA release, and
because X has no standard printing mechanism, printing will
probably also be unsupported.</p><p>Development will not stop with the BETA release. If anything,
it will speed up as more programmers become familiar with the
project. New BETA releases will be released periodically as Wine
progresses.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13f0580.0x14e9160"></a>In the Present</h2></div></div><p>To continue to develop Wine, we need your help. All the work
on the project is currently being done by volunteers with Internet
access, so anyone with Internet access may join the project. If you
are interested, but are not skilled at Windows programming, start
by reading the FAQ, available from tsx-11.mit.edu or aris.com in
/pub/linux/ALPHA/Wine/Wine.FAQ.</p><p>There are several projects that can be done by newcomers to
the project who are not yet skilled in Windows programming, and
there are also reading recommendations for learning the Windows
programming skills you need to be of more help to the
project.</p><p>If you have more money than time, please consider a donation
to the Wine project. Donations will be used to hire programmers to
accelerate the development. If you are interested in making a
donation of any size, please contact
