    The 1994 DECUS conference offered a large assortment of
    hardware and software for everyone, from the novice to the
    professional. DECUS is the Digital Equipment Computer Users
    Society and its semi-annual conference was held in New
    Orleans May 7-12, 1994.

Community was the special appearance of the &ldquo;Father of Linux&rdquo;,
Linus Torvalds. There were two sessions which featured Linus and
both were very informative and entertaining. The sessions were
called &ldquo;An Introduction to Linux&rdquo; and &ldquo;Implementation Issues in
Linux&rdquo;. During the sessions, I learned a great deal about the Linux
Operating System as well as the promising future of Linux.
</p><p>According to Linus, there are over 176,000 lines of code in
the kernel of which 88,000 lines of code are for device drivers.
While Linus is the primary author of the kernel, most of the device
driver code has been contributed by others.</p><p>The history of Linux may be short compared to the Unix time
scale: three years versus twenty-five years. However, much has
happened since the beginning of Linux. A few milestones for Linux
follow:</p><p>From 1991 to the present, Linus has demonstrated tremendous
dedication to Linux. For example, the virtual memory code was
written in just three days-and it was the three days before
Christmas! In three short years, Linux has transformed itself from
a very simple terminal emulator to a powerful enhanced Unix
operating system. A great deal of work is now being done to further
enhance the existing kernel and implement new features. Some of the
work in progress involves kernel threads, extended memory
management, file system optimizations, and ports to other
architectures such as the 68K and the Power PC and maybe even the
DEC Alpha.</p><p>I had the pleasure of spending an afternoon with Linus in New
Orleans, Louisiana and was able to learn a lot about Linus and what
his interests are other than the Linux operating system. This was
my first chance to meet Linus in person and I was shocked to find
that he was not at all the &ldquo;computer hacker geek&rdquo; that I dared to
imagine. Linus is one of the nicest and most personable people I
have ever had the pleasure of spending time with. He has a
wonderful sense of humor and is very funny. I found myself laughing
non-stop during our chats. Linus lives at home with his family and
cats and likes to spend time with his girlfriend. He teaches at the
University of Helsinki.</p><p>Lately, he has been traveling around the world talking about
Linux. Linus jokes that</p><p>&ldquo;if you want to travel around the world and be invited to
speak at a lot of different places, just write a Unix operating
system.&rdquo; Upon meeting Linus, one would never dream that he was the
author of a Unix operating system; he never brags, boasts or even
seems to want very much recognition for his massive effort.</p><p>There never seemed to be any selfish attitude at all from
Linus. I wish all software developers had the attitude and
determination to produce quality code such as Linux and want
little, if anything, in return. Someone asked him at DECUS how he
felt about other people and companies using part or all the Linux
kernel for profit and not giving him any money. Linus simply
replied, &ldquo;I wrote Linux for public use, not for the money.&rdquo;</p><p><a href="2791s1.html" target="_self">More info</a></p><p><a href="2791s2.html" target="_self">Releases</a></p></div></div>
