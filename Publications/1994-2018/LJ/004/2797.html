    MicroSat Ground Station Software for Linux and X-Windows, Toolkit for Linux CD-ROM (May 1994) and more.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ada580.0x1bd2138"></a></h2></div></div><p>This is the first ALPHA release (0.4) of
my MicroSat ground station software for Linux and X-Windows.
</p><p>The software is available by anonymous ftp from ftp.ucsd.edu
in the file microsat-0.4.tar.gz. I uploaded it into the
/hamradio/packet/tcpip/incoming directory, but hopefully someone
will move it to the /hamradio/sat directory. I also uploaded it to
ftp.funet.fi in the /pub/ham/incoming but should be moved into
/pub/ham/satellite/microsat.</p><p>To run this software, you must be running a 1.0 (or greater)
kernel with the AX25.012 release of the GW4PTS AX.25 package
(available on sunacm.swan.ac.uk in /pub/Linux/Radio).</p><p>All the programs are written using the OpenLook toolkit, but
should work with other X-Windows window managers (i.e., tm).</p><p>This release consists of the following programs:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>xpb - broadcast monitor</p></li><li><p>directory - directory list viewer</p></li><li><p>downloaded - downloaded file list viewer</p></li><li><p>viewtext - uncompressed ASCII text file
viewer</p></li><li><p>upload - message upload application</p></li><li><p>message - message preparation application</p></li></ul></div><p>Also included are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>lha - unpack an lhz compressed file</p></li><li><p>unzip - unpack a PKZIP file</p></li><li><p>xloadimage - an X-Windows image viewer that has
been modified to display EIS images (directly from the .dl file,
and from the extracted file)</p></li></ul></div><p>You should note that this is still ALPHA release software (as
is the AX.25 package for the kernel), and I am continuing to
develop this software. I believe that it is now in a state that
others can give me good feedback.</p><p>The release includes all the source, and I encourage others
to help develop this software package. I would appreciate hearing
from anyone who is planning to make fixes/changes/enhancements to
the software, so that I can try to coordinate future
releases.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ada580.0x1bd2b88"></a>Toolkit for Linux CD-ROM (May 1994)</h2></div></div><p>The new Toolkit for Linux CD-ROM from Walnut Creek features

Walnut Creek CD-ROM
(<a href="mailto:info@cdrom.com">info@cdrom.com</a> or
800-786-9907 in the US). I don't intend to write a comprehensive
review here, just offer a quick look at what you get. Expect a more
complete review in a future issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>Having used the Yggdrasil Fall 93 version of this product as
well as both Slackware from Trans-Ameritech and on floppy directly
from the archives on ftp.cdrom.com, I have some reasonable
experiences for comparison. And the executive summary is that no
Linux distribution is perfect (yet) but this one is certainly worth
considering.</p><p>What Yggdrasil has attempted to do is give you a package that
is easy to get up and running and is complete enough to satisfy
most any Linux user. To make this possible you get a 95-page
manual, CD-ROM and a 3.5" boot disk. The front cover of the manual
tells you what is included (76,323 files, X-Windows, Andrew System,
Networking, Games, Multimedia, Text editors, Desktop Publishing and
Telecommunications) and the back lists the supported hardware.
Thus, you know what you are getting before you have to open the
package.</p><p>The first 1/4 of the manual takes you through the
installation. But, even without reading the manual, it is easy. You
boot from the floppy and load a live Linux system with the CD-ROM
as your main file system. It's slow but it works. You then have
options for how much to install on your hard disk with choices from
4MB to 1GB. If you select the custom installation (best choice as
there is a bug in the standard installation) about 35MB of files
are loaded. They you can use a tck/tk-based installer program to
select the packages you want.</p><p>The hardest part of the whole installation is waiting for
information to be loaded. I loaded about 200MB of files from an old
Mitsumi CD-ROM drive with 8-bit controller and it took almost a
day. But it worked. And I had a system that booted, recognized my
ethernet adapter, configured X pretty much automatically and talked
to my network with no hitches.</p><p>[Ed: I also ran Plug-and-play, on a machine with no hard
drive at all, simply running off the CD-ROM, and was quite pleased
with how easy it was to use. It was at work, and my boss was quite
impressed.]</p><p>But, as I said, no distribution is perfect. Once you have
your Plug-and-Play box up you can play a lot. But if you want to
configure printers or any of the other mundane configuration jobs
you will have to dig in and do it yourself. Also, on the negative
side, the package selection menu is at the level of &ldquo;do you want
the Andrew system&rdquo; and &ldquo;do you want Emacs&rdquo;. Reasonable but
distributions like Slackware offer you a much finer set of
choices&mdash;something that could be important if you are a little
cramped for disk space.</p><p>The other reservation I have about Yggdrasil is that they
have ignored the Linux file system standard. The standard isn't
perfect (and it is really an evolving standard, not a
cast-in-concrete one) but Yggdrasil makes no attempt to follow it.
This may not be a problem as long as you stay with Yggdrasil
distributions but could cause problems if you add packages from
other distributions or archive sites in the Internet.</p><p>Are there any bugs? Most certainly. During the installation
there were a few unexplained error messages. beach_ball blows up
but xgopher works. There is a bug sheet that comes with the system.
And I am sure there are more bugs. But Yggdrasil makes this
information available. You can get a current bug report list by
sending e-mail to
<a href="mailto:query-pr@yggdrasil.com">query-pr@yggdrasil.com</a>
. And there is a built-in mechanism to report bugs via
e-mail.</p><p>If you have a CD-ROM drive, Linux on CD-ROM is the way to go.
The nominal cost is more than recovered in saved time and saved
backup media. And &ldquo;Plug-and-Play&rdquo; is certainly worth
considering.</p></div></div>
