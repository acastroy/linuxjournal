    The first in a series by our favorite artist to take a look
    at the most commonly used window managers.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a6580.0x249e558"></a></h2></div></div><p>A few years ago, I did a four-part series
on the GIMP for <i  >Linux Journal</i>. Those articles
served as the basis for my book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Artists' Guide to
the GIMP</em></span>, which was published about a year later. I like
to write about using Linux from an end-user perspective. Developers
are expected to be able to dig and scratch for information. End
users need a little more hand-holding. Since the GIMP helped me
pretend to be artistic, I tend to approach my writing from what I
think an artist might want. In this way, I can show that Linux is
more than just a place to dig and scratch. You can actually get
real work accomplished here.
</p><p>In this new series of articles, I'm going to look at the
coming of age of the Linux desktop. In particular, I'll talk about
window managers. The desktop has not been the strongest arena for
Linux. Many users have complained that the desktop is too clunky or
lacks basic features. But the problems that have been pointed out
simply require time&mdash;time for Linux to mature and developers to
write code. What Linux currently lacks in basic features, however,
it makes up for in pizzazz. The Linux desktop is an extremely
personable place to work.</p><p>Some might say it's fluff. Others refer to it as eye candy.
Call it what you want, the Linux desktop has loads of personality.
Window managers are a major part of this, although they should not
be mistaken for the entire desktop environment. In fact, this is
where we'll start. Just what is the difference between a window
manager and a desktop environment?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a6580.0x249e7c0"></a>GNOMEs and Sprockets and Bears, Oh My!</h2></div></div><p>The current buzz in the Linux desktop world focuses on two
major players: GNOME and KDE. In nerd parlance, these are desktop
environments. GNOME comes to us from Miguel de Icaza, et al. via
support from Red Hat, and is based on GTK, the software libraries
that are used for the buttons, sliders and so forth you see in
GIMP. KDE is based on QT and comes from Matthias Ettrich and the
KDE Development Group. Both QT and GTK are known as widget sets.
Usually, you use widget sets to build applications, like GIMP or
KIllustrator, but GNOME and KDE go beyond just providing
applications. They provide infrastructure&mdash;underlying rules and
guidelines for how applications should look and act. They provide
software libraries for allowing applications to communicate with
one another. This is how things like drag and drop get implemented.
Without GNOME and KDE, dragging a file icon into a wastebasket or
onto the printer icon wouldn't be possible.</p><p>There are other environments besides GNOME and KDE. The most
widely used environment on UNIX systems is probably CDE, the Common
Desktop Environment. CDE is based on a commercial package which
uses Motif, and is included on just about every major UNIX
workstation these days. Versions of CDE are available for Linux,
but most people have stuck to either KDE or GNOME because they have
lower licensing fees. Motif used to be very expensive, and although
its price has dropped considerably, it's still relatively expensive
to license for Linux distributors. Since the desktop environment is
expected to be part of any OS distribution, Linux distributors had
to either charge extra for CDE or work with KDE and GNOME. Their
choice was obvious.</p><p>KDE and GNOME both offer very similar features. Each provides
a panel&mdash;a bar along one edge of the screen used to launch
applications, show system status and allow embedded
applications&mdash;and can be used with any compliant window manager.
Session managers and CORBA support are less visible than the panel,
but are probably more important to users. Session managers allow
you to start an application at the same place you left it the last
time you used it. CORBA allows for interaction between
applications. Session management and CORBA are provided as a set of
rules (via programming libraries, if you care about that)
applications must follow in order for them to work properly in
these environments.</p><p>Desktop environments provide the entire desktop experience
for the user. This ranges from pagers and drag and drop to
standardized applications. Both KDE and GNOME have file
managers&mdash;graphical interfaces for managing files. Window managers
don't usually provide such a tool. Calendars, word processors and
spreadsheets are also applications that exist for use with KDE and
GNOME, but which are not considered part of those environments;
these are just ordinary applications which comply with the rules
KDE and GNOME provide for interoperability. Although you'll hear
both GNOME and KDE talk about these tools as part of their
environments, don't be fooled&mdash;you can pick your own spreadsheet
application; you don't have to use the ones that come with KDE or
GNOME.</p><p>One feature that is extremely useful is the pager. The Linux
desktop allows you to have off-screen areas you can jump to. These
are called virtual desktops, and each desktop often has multiple
pages. Essentially, each of these is like an extension of your
visible screen&mdash;extra screen space with which to work.</p><p>Both KDE and GNOME provide their own pagers, as do most
window managers. In order for a window manager's pager to work
properly in its respective environment, the window manager needs to
be compliant with that environment. Fortunately, the window
managers we'll be discussing are at least partially compliant in
one or both environments.</p><p>There are a few other differences between GNOME and KDE. KDE
already has a built-in help system, while GNOME just recently
released one. GNOME is considered by some users to be a little
top-heavy&mdash;it can use a lot of memory, for example. It's also less
stable than KDE. GNOME, as a project, is about a year younger than
KDE, but both have strong development teams working on them. In
general, you'll probably be fairly happy with either environment.
In fact, if you're like me and don't use drag and drop, file
managers or worry about interoperability between applications, you
can live without either KDE or GNOME. I don't run either&mdash;at least
not yet.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a6580.0x249ead8"></a>Window Managers</h2></div></div><p>Where KDE and GNOME provide that overall desktop experience,
window managers do something a little more basic. They provide the
facility which allows you to move your windows around the screen,
iconify and maximize them, and kill off those applications which
just refuse to go away. Window managers also determine the look of
the windows&mdash;the borders and title bars, the background images and
so forth. The configurable framings you specify for your windows
are called themes. It's the pizzazz we talked of earlier. For
artists and anyone interested in personalizing their private
desktops, the window manager is the focus.</p><p>KDE and GNOME provide default window managers: kwm for KDE
and Enlightenment (or, more recently, Sawmill) for GNOME. A desktop
environment wouldn't be very useful without a window manager. It
would, in fact, be almost useless. The relationship between desktop
environments and window managers is fairly symbiotic. However, you
don't have to use the default window managers provided by these
environments. You can run any window manager&mdash;and there are
several&mdash;with either environment. In order to make use of all the
underlying features of KDE or GNOME (such as session management),
you need to run a window manager which is compliant, and not all
window managers are. In fact, very few are fully compliant with
either KDE or GNOME, much less with both of them. For this reason,
I'll be focusing on three window managers that are compliant with
at least one of these environments and which provide support for
themes: Enlightenment, Window Maker and AfterStep.</p><p>Like their desktop environment counterparts, window managers
usually provide extra features which border on being applications
on their own. Pagers fit in this category. Whether you use the
environment's pager or the window manager's pager depends mostly on
choice, although use of the panel in either KDE or GNOME may force
you to use their pagers as well. Window managers also provide
management of desktop icons. In most cases, this is hidden from the
user&mdash;you get a graphical tool for specifying where the icons get
placed (left side, right side, restricted to a specific region,
etc.). In some window managers, you get a visible box for the
icons, called the icon box. Enlightenment, for example, uses a very
obvious box by default which can be configured to be essentially
invisible.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a6580.0x249ec90"></a>Themes</h2></div></div><p>After all this technical jargon, we get to the part which
artists will likely love the most&mdash;themes. Themes do nothing more
than specify the look of backgrounds (on the root window or in any
other window), window borders, icons, and in some cases, the
applications themselves. It's fluff, but interesting fluff&mdash;a
personalization of the computer on which you spend so much of your
life.</p><p>Window managers provide most of the features you need for
themes. KDE and GNOME have support for themes, but they do it
differently. KDE's default window manager, kwm, supports themes
like any other window manager. GNOME gets its support from GTK, the
widget set I spoke of earlier. GTK is interesting because it allows
you to give the same theme to any application based on it. In other
words, GNOME applications, which are generally based on GTK, can
all be changed at the same time by changing the GTK theme. This
sort of change affects not just the window borders, but the
buttons, menus and other visible pieces of an application. KDE,
Enlightenment, Window Maker and AfterStep change only the look of
window manager features. They don't change the look of application
buttons, menus and so forth.</p><p>KDE allows you to change the current theme on the fly using
its Control Panel. GNOME does too, using its own Control Center.
Both of these are accessed from their respective environment's
panels. Window Maker, AfterStep and Enlightenment allow you to
change the theme on the fly as well by using tools that may or may
not be included in their respective standard distributions. You can
also change the themes by hand if you're so inclined. However,
themes are a relatively new phenomenon, and standardized ways of
defining and installing them have not been set. In most cases,
you'll want to use the graphical tools for installing the themes.
Creating new themes is rather complex and very specific to each
environment or window manager. In this series of articles, I'll
stick to discussing installing themes. In the future, I'll look
into writing about making your own themes, once the process of
doing so isn't quite so convoluted.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a6580.0x249ee48"></a>What to Look For?</h2></div></div><p>Since window managers keep less information on running
applications than the desktop environments do (via their session
management features), they tend to take up less memory. Of course,
there are exceptions to every rule. AfterStep has a small memory
footprint, but because Enlightenment is so graphics-intensive, it
can have a huge footprint. On your desktop, which has a gigabyte of
memory so you can work on huge print images in the GIMP, it
probably won't matter which window manager you use based on memory
usage. But it will make a difference on memory-limited laptops.
Memory usage is something to be aware of, depending on where you're
working.</p><p>A good pager is essential. I don't work with GNOME or KDE
(they don't provide features I need right now), so I can choose any
window manager. For a long time, I used only FVWM2, specifically
because of its pager. The desktops and their pages were displayed
as small boxes right on the screen, and I could drag windows from
one desktop to another simply by dragging it from the pager into
the main screen. The pager also showed the names of the windows
(from their title bars), albeit in truncated form. The sizes of the
windows in the pager were proportional to their actual sizes in
their desktops. Enlightenment now has a very similar pager which I
find very attractive in its look and usage. Window Maker, on the
other hand, has a pager which is just a button that bounces you
around the desktops, but I can't see what's in each of them until I
get there. I also can't divide the pager into multiple desktops
with multiple pages in each. In Window Maker, I get essentially one
page per desktop. Whether you consider this good or bad is a matter
of personal taste. What is important is that you consider the pager
in the window manager you choose, since you will be using it quite
a bit.</p><p>On-line help is useful, but only initially. Both desktop
environments have on-line help built into them. Enlightenment has
its own help system; Window Maker and AfterStep have HTML-based
help. The usefulness of this depends on how long it takes you to
become familiar with the environment. In my opinion, if you need to
refer to the help system for months on end, the system is far too
complex and you should consider looking at another window
manager.</p><p>Now, if we go beyond these basic necessities, we get into the
niceties. It would be helpful if your window manager had the
ability to add dockable applications. These are sometimes called
applets, epplets and various other things (everyone has their own
terminology, apparently). It's an application with a very specific
function&mdash;e.g., monitoring the time you've spent on-line with your
ISP&mdash;that runs in a small icon or, more commonly, in a panel.
You'll want your window manager to provide features which can
maximize screen space, too. Things like window shading&mdash;rolling a
window up into its title bar to hide it, and unrolling it back down
again. This reduces the visual clutter of your desktop, but it's
certainly not required for the window manager to be useful. A pager
that can be hidden would also be nice. Enlightenment provides this,
but Window Maker doesn't because its pager doesn't take up as much
space as Enlightenment's can. Of course, you'll want theme support.
After all, pizzazz is the whole point.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a6580.0x249f058"></a>Changing Window Managers</h2></div></div><p>How do you use your window manager of choice? If you're using
KDE or GNOME, you're probably logging in and everything is already
set for you.</p><p>With GNOME, you can specify a separate window manager just by
editing your $HOME/.Xclients file. You probably don't have one of
these to start, but you can create it by hand. For example, to run
GNOME with Window Maker, your .Xclients file would look like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gnome-session&amp;
wmaker
</pre><p>KDE is a little different. It needs to start a couple of
different programs. If you have the
<span   class="bold"><b>startkde</b></span> script (available on Red
Hat 6.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> or similar systems, possibly on
others), you can replace kwm in that script with the window manager
of your choice.
</p><p>Whether you start X manually (using
<span   class="bold"><b>startx</b></span>, for example) or have it
start automatically when you log in, modifying your .Xclients file
should be sufficient to get your window manager going.</p><p>So that's an introduction to desktop environments and window
managers. It can seem complex, but it really isn't hard to
understand after you've used it for a while. As with anything new,
unfamiliarity breeds contempt. You just need some time to make
friends with this new world.</p><p>In the next article, I'll cover the Enlightenment window
manager in depth. This will include issues on building, installing,
configuring and using it. That will be followed by articles on
Window Maker and AfterStep. In the end, you'll become familiar
enough with these so that you can pick and choose from the many
window managers available. At that point, your computer will no
longer be someone else's idea of a desktop. It will truly be
yours.</p></div></div>
