simpler. We had the GPL (General Public License), now in version
2.0 for those suspicious of 1.0 releases. We had the BSD license.
And there was a &ldquo;free but restricted&rdquo; license, which stipulated
that if you used the program to make money, the developers wanted
some too (sounds fair to me). Last week, I was looking through some
of the licenses we have now; some I can't understand at all.
There's the Open Source license, the Sun Open Source license, the
Corel license, several variations on the free but restricted
license, an Artistic license and a few others I don't recall. For
those of us who can't afford to keep lawyers around, we'll just
need to read and comply with these licenses the best we can and
hope it's sufficient to keep us out of court.
</p><p>WebCal:
<a href="http://bulldog.tzo.org/webcal/webcal.html" target="_self">bulldog.tzo.org/webcal/webcal.html</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>WebCal</b></span> is a nice,
easy-to-use web calendaring tool. Users can create their own
private calendar, allow others to read it and perhaps a select few
to maintain it. Calendars can be created for conference rooms, for
scheduling, etc. It is very well-done and doesn't require anything
extraordinary. The calendar will even e-mail you a reminder if you
need one. It requires Apache or another web server that can handle
permission files &agrave; la
<span   class="bold"><b>htpasswd</b></span>, and a frames-capable
browser.</p><p>tkballistic:
<a href="http://members.xoom.com/joshua_weage/ballistic" target="_self">http://members.xoom.com/joshua_weage/ballistic/</a></p><p>Gun buffs out there can have a good time with
<span   class="bold"><b>tkballistic</b></span>. If you know the
bullet diameter in inches, its weight in grains and the muzzle
velocity in ft/sec, you can find out almost anything you want to
know about the flight path of the projectile. If you also have the
wind velocity in ft/sec and the angle in degrees, you can save a
trajectory table. This application will also calculate ballistic
coefficient and maximum point blank range. It requires Python and
tkinter.</p><p>gbase:
<a href="http://www.hibernaculum.demon.co.uk" target="_self">http://www.hibernaculum.demon.co.uk/</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>gbase</b></span> is just what I wanted
for Christmas! Working on networks, I find there's always a need to
convert between decimal, hexadecimal, octal and binary. This little
utility does it extremely well. The four text boxes are placed one
below the other. Enter a number in the box of the type you know,
and as you type, the numbers in the other boxes will increment. I
doubt this application will leave the workspace of my laptop any
time soon. It's simple and efficient. It requires libgtk, libgdk,
libgmodule, libglib, libdl, libXext, libX11, libm and glibc.</p><p>xipdump:
<a href="http://www.epita.fr/~lse/xipdump" target="_self">http://www.epita.fr/~lse/xipdump/</a></p><p>For those familiar with
<span   class="bold"><b>tcpdump</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>xipdump</b></span> is similar, but makes
packets readable using a box containing the packet information,
rather than the stream-type output of tcpdump. The author chose key
bindings that remind me of Sun OpenWin bindings; not very
intuitive, but easy to get used to. The program allows you to
change and reinsert packets, etc. Since most work, including
reading the packet stream, is performed on raw sockets, only root
can run this, but you wouldn't want non-privileged users playing
with this program anyway. It requires libnet, libXaw, libXmu,
libXt, libXext, libX11, glibc, libSM, libICE and libpcap.</p><p>MyAddressPHP:
<a href="http://rob.current.nu/MyAddressPHP" target="_self">http://rob.current.nu/MyAddressPHP/</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>MyAddressPHP</b></span> is notable for
the ease with which it can be installed. The author put some effort
into making the installation as painless as possible for this type
of package. While he does assume you've configured your web server
to handle PHP documents, the rest (setting up the software and
database) is easy if you follow the instructions carefully. It is
what it says it is: an address book, but one that allows you to add
pictures. This is handy as a database for any organization that
uses picture badges or wants to maintain individual photos. Some
features are not yet implemented, but the shells are in place. It
requires MySQL, PHP3, a web server and a web browser.</p><p>mygde:
<a href="http://ringil.stampede.org/mygde" target="_self">http://ringil.stampede.org/mygde/</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>mygde</b></span> is used for accessing
a MySQL server and is patterned after xMySQL. However, this package
uses gtk rather than the xforms library. It does similar
operations, allowing the creation of and access to tables. Queries
can be created using point and click rather than entering SQL
commands, although not all SQL commands are available. For example,
if you need to perform complex outer joins, this tool won't help
yet, but adding those query types shouldn't be difficult. It
requires libm, libgtk, libgdk, libgmodule, libglib, libdl, libXext,
libX11, glibc and libnsl.</p><p>FreeS/WAN:
<a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~freeswan" target="_self">http://www.xs4all.nl/~freeswan/</a></p><p>At last, the FreeS/WAN package is ready for the
2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and above kernels. This package allows
you to create encrypted tunnels between Internet-connected systems.
You could use it to create encrypted tunnels between any two hosts,
but there's little sense in doing so on a &ldquo;trusted&rdquo; network. This
is primarily aimed at providing encrypted tunnels between two
locations connected only via the Internet. What makes this package
so good, or at least better than SSH? The license&mdash;this one comes
with no strings. That's not true of SSH v1 and even less of SSH v2.
The FreeS/WAN package compiles into the kernel in a manner simple
enough for relatively inexperienced administrators, yet doesn't
prevent experienced ones from adding other patches and custom
configurations. It requires working kernel sources, libraries and
tools to compile the kernel.</p><p>gtktetris:
<a href="http://www.sudac.org/~napolium/linux" target="_self">http://www.sudac.org/~napolium/linux/</a></p><p>What can be said about yet another Tetris clone, except
perhaps that <span   class="bold"><b>gtktetris</b></span> compiles
easily on any system with the gtk libraries? The version I looked
at works well, but I was unable to find a &ldquo;drop&rdquo; key to just let
the pieces fall. This is one of my wife's favorite games, and she
enjoys nice-looking color graphics, which this program has. It
requires libgtk, libgdk, libgmodule, libglib, libdl, libXext,
libX11, libm and glibc.</p></div></div>
