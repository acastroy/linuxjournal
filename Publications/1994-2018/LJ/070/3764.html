intermediate Linux user. It skips all the installation procedures,
assuming you already have Linux installed. Also, the information is
presented without any background material or newbie-type
instructions, with the assumption you have been using Linux a while
and know the first steps. Still, the information is not too
advanced. The target audience seems not to be a truly intermediate
user, but someone who is just far enough along to no longer
consider himself a newbie&mdash;perhaps a &ldquo;newly intermediate&rdquo; user.
For example, sections are included on the basics of Linux
command-line entry, learning path names and setting permissions.
However, for the most part, the authors do assume you have some
elementary knowledge.</p><p>The presentation of the information in the book as well as
the layout is designed to give the reader just what he is looking
for and no more. It is easy to find any subject of interest. Much
is presented in the &ldquo;if you want to make this event happen, do
these commands&rdquo;, a format I like very much.</p><p>The authors go on to more advanced subjects, such as basic
network configuration, connecting to the Internet, INN and NNTP,
configuring DNS, Apache, Samba and rebuilding the kernel. There are
also chapters on using Linux and Windows together, using Linux on a
laptop, and the all-important security chapter.</p><p>There was no &ldquo;about the authors&rdquo;, so I cannot tell you
their credentials. I did notice that Rich Grace is also the author
of <span   class="emphasis"><em>WINDOWS 98 to go</em></span>. I always like to know
something about the authors of a book and why I should trust their
instructions. It is nice to know if the author is an expert on the
subject or just a good writer who has taken the relevant
information from others and put it into a readable form. Anyway, I
consider the omission of this section the book's most serious
lack&mdash;not too bad, when you think about it.</p><p>The book is well-written and well-designed; the information
accurate, easy to read and understand. If you are past the newbie
stage and ready to go to the next level, this could be the book for
you.</p></div></div>
