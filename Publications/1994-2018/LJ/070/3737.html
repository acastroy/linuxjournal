    If you are tired of the complexity of configuring PnP
    devices for Linux, you can look forward to some relief from
    the 2.4 kernel release.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d4d580.0x1e453a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>An amazing number of features are new or
improved under (what will be) Linux 2.4. In my article last month,
&ldquo;Bullet Points: Linux 2.4&rdquo;, I described a number of these
features. The one feature which I feel will most change the face of
distributions in the years to come (if only in terms of their
support for legacy devices) is ISA Plug-and-Play support.
</p><p>Back in the good old days (before PCI became the standard bus
architecture for Intel-class PCs), buses weren't very smart in and
of themselves. Plug-and-Play features were largely not present in
these older machines. It was expected that if you owned the
machine, you more or less understood exactly what hardware was in
it and exactly where each device &ldquo;lived&rdquo; in the computer
innerspace. Adding a new sound card, for example, was often an
exercise in &ldquo;put in&mdash;reboot&mdash;pull out&mdash;change jumpers&mdash;repeat&rdquo;,
as the vast majority of ISA cards required hardware jumpers or
something similar to be configurable. This situation was not very
good for consumer users of PCs, whose understanding of their
machines' internals was slowly degrading to the point at which new
users were hardly expected to know where to plug in the
mouse.</p><p>In conference rooms of computer manufacturers around the
world, meetings were held and standards debated over how this user
barrier could be overcome. (At least, that's how it happened in my
personal universe.) Sure, having a better bus would be nice, but
that would require things to change. Some bright soul got the idea
to band-aid the situation via a standard in configurable cards
which could be configured by a wise BIOS or operating system. The
ISAPNP &ldquo;standard&rdquo; was thus born.</p><p>ISAPNP filled in all those Plug-and-Play gaps we suffered
from in the ISA world. No longer would we have to blindly probe for
devices, as they would happily announce themselves (more or less)
to anyone who would listen. No longer would we be forced to change
jumper settings, as instead we had a neat DOS utility to do that
for us. But that was the real crux of the problem: PnP-compatible
quickly came to mean &ldquo;DOS/Windows only&rdquo;, as other operating
systems of the time found they could not speak the magic language
of the PnP specification. Linux, too, fell into this trap; it was
often advised that one should initialize his or her cards under DOS
and (soft) reboot into Linux to make things work.</p><p>Fortunately, if you give the Linux community a problem, it
isn't long until a solution of some kind can be found. For some,
<span   class="bold"><b>loadlin</b></span> and a DOS partition were
still the only answer, but for others there were the ISA PnP
utilities which were, until recently, <span   class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> way
to configure PnP devices under Linux and elsewhere. This utility,
handy as it is, is a pain for many users to figure out. It requires
users to resolve resource conflicts on their own. It requires
drivers to be compiled as modules so they can be loaded after the
user space utility had run. Over time, the interface to this
utility improved; it could even do a decent job of autoconfiguring
cards. Distributions started supporting it and masking its
functionality under a protective shield of pretty dialog boxes so
that even the clueless could stand a chance at getting it to work.
Still, it was not a perfect solution.</p><p>Linux 2.4 will, for the first time, support ISA PnP devices
internally. No longer will a user space utility be required to
configure cards to be used; the kernel itself can now do it.
Generally, this is to be done transparently: the serial driver or
the soundblaster driver will simply do a search for PnP devices in
the same way they now search for and configure PCI devices. When a
compatible device is found, the kernel can configure and activate
it and pass the resources it uses on to the driver responsible. The
kernel can even handle resource conflicts. Of course, there are
probably settings and configurations which the kernel will not get
right, and there will always be the option to &ldquo;fall back&rdquo; to the
old user-space-by-hand configuration. But this, in my opinion, is a
great step forward for desktop Linux.</p><p>Now, the warnings: Linux 2.4 isn't even released yet, so how
can you take advantage of these remarkable new features in your
machines? You can download a snapshot of the latest Linux 2.3
(developers only) kernel and compile it for your system. Will it
work? Probably. Will it support your cards? Well, maybe not. If
you're a programmer, there isn't a better time to get involved with
Linux 2.3 development and help the mainstream kernel hackers squash
the bugs to make Linux 2.4 the best Linux ever. If you're not a
programmer, you can help just by downloading, compiling and
installing a recent kernel and reporting the results. Linux is
developed by the community, and as we approach the next stable
milestone, it is the community members who can make a difference.
Next time you are sitting in front of your computer trying to tweak
your isapnp.conf to work with your new modem, think of those brave
souls behind their keyboards who work so hard to make Linux the
best damn operating system it can be and give them a hand.</p></div></div>
