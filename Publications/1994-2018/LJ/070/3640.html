developers with an integrated C, C++ and Java tool suite. The Code
Fusion environment includes an ANSI/ISO C compiler, an ANSI
Tracking C++ compiler and a Java compiler. A linker, build utility,
debugger, source browser, an interface to version control systems,
plus some other utilities are also included in this IDE (integrated
development environment). Could this be an IDE for the masses?
</p><p>Code Fusion is an integration of two other Cygnus products:
Source Navigator and Cygnus Insight (also known as GNUPro Toolkit.
Each of these products has been reviewed in <i  >Linux Journal</i>.) The integration of these two products provides
a very usable integrated development environment. A primary
advantage of the Code Fusion IDE is its quick visual access to
project files, commands and build configuration files. Another
positive attribute of Code Fusion is the compiler. It has been
optimized for the Intel Pentium processors. Some benchmarks
indicate a significant improvement in compile speeds. Compiles of
my sample C, C++ and Java code went very quickly. Unfortunately, my
code was too short to get a good measure of the compiler's true
speed improvement.</p><p>In addition to the C and C++ compilers, Code Fusion includes
a GNU Compiler for Java (GCJ/gcj). GCJ is a front end for the gcc
compiler. GCJ accepts .java, .class, .jar and .zip file types.
Using the <b  >-C</b> option,
<span   class="bold"><b>gcj</b></span> makes .java files into .class
files. GCJ is capable of natively compiling both Java source and
bytecode. More information on the gcj compiler is available at
<a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/java" target="_self">http://sourceware.cygnus.com/java/</a>.</p><p>Code Fusion version 1.0 GCJ is compatible with JDK 1.1 and
includes some JDK 1.2 functionality. Several pages of the manual
are devoted to listing the specific Java 1.1 and 1.2
classes/methods/fields that are/are not included in the
distribution.</p><p>Opening a Java project with Code Fusion provides the same
kinds of access to Java information available for C and C++
projects. For example, the Source Navigator's Symbol Browser
provides a visual representation of a Java project's files, classes
and methods. Selecting a file, class or method opens the Source
Navigator's Editor Window. Within this window are four browsers, an
editor and search tools. A GUI compiling function is included
within the Source Navigator portion of Code Fusion. Insight,
Cygnus' GNU debugger, may also be used to debug compiled Java
programs. I found this tool very useful in understanding some Java
code I had acquired.</p><p>Code Fusion's target audience seems to be the experienced
individual developer. I feel the Code Fusion IDE code-building
conventions may not make a lot of sense if you are not already
familiar, or comfortable, with building applications from the
command line. The example application-build tutorial provides
adequate guidance on what IDE dialog boxes to use, how to access
the IDE dialog boxes and what data are needed to build the example
code. There is little guidance as to why you are using a dialog box
or why you are entering the requested data. I feel this
understanding can come only from having learned to do it the
old-fashioned way.</p><p>As with Source Navigator, Code Fusion's Version Control is
based on RCS, CVS, SCCS and the Clear Case product. There were some
version control functionality bugs in my review copy of Code
Fusion. I could only check project code in or out. I got error
messages whenever I tried to use any of the other IDE version
control functions, so I contacted Cygnus about the symptoms I was
receiving. Cygnus promptly informed me they were aware of the
symptoms and were in the process of testing a fix. This should be
fixed by the time this review is published.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1663580.0x175bfa8"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Code Fusion v1.0 supports Caldera 2.2, Red Hat 5.2/6.0 and
SuSE 6.1 Linux distributions. This product requires a Pentium with
memory&mdash;Cygnus recommends 64MB. This product also needs about 200MB
of free disk space to install. My Caldera distribution mounts the
Code Fusion CD-ROM as a non-executable device. A README file
containing guidance on mounting an executable CD-ROM device is
included.</p><p>Installation is divided into loading the application and
configuring it. There is a CLI and a GUI install script; I chose to
use the GUI script. Code Fusion came with a preprinted CD asset
key. The asset key-based install means you need one licensed copy
of the product per developer. Installation involves entering the
asset key, typing in the installation directory and choosing the
type of install.</p><p>After entering the asset key, you are presented with a
graphic of the file systems and told to select your install
directory. At the bottom of this graphic is a text field displaying
the default path. The release I reviewed would not respond to a
directory selection&mdash;I had to type over the contents shown in the
directory text field. A custom install option provides the means of
selecting which Code Fusion files or components to install. Two
status bars are presented once the install begins. One bar
indicates which of the seventeen files is being installed, the
other indicates the file's install progress. The install is not
complete until a couple of environment variables are
configured.</p><p>I once saw the phrase &ldquo;Here there be dragons&rdquo; on a museum
map. The &ldquo;Here there be dragons&rdquo; phrase truly applies to the
environment-variable configuration step. These variables
<span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be configured prior to running Code
Fusion. In addition to adjusting the standard
<b  >PATH</b> variable, two other environment variables
need to be established to ensure Code Fusion uses the proper
libraries in the proper sequence: <b  >LD_PRELOAD</b> and
<b  >LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b>.</p><p>The <b  >LD_PRELOAD</b> variable points to a
library that must be loaded before any other shared libraries are
loaded. There are two ways of establishing the
<b  >LD_PRELOAD</b> path: one is to include the variable
in one of the traditional environment setup files, the other is to
use the /etc/ld.so.preload file. Here is where the dragon lived. A
simple typographical error in this /etc/ld.so.preload file raised
havoc with my system, the likes of which you don't want to
experience. I tried both maintenance and shell boots; neither of
them were of much use. I found it easier to restore my system from
a backup I had made just prior to starting the install. The next
time I got to this environment variable configuration step, I
placed the <b  >LD_PRELOAD</b> variable into a test
user's .profile. This way, I could localize any problems to a
single user ID. Needless to say, I was triple cautious when it came
to setting up the <b  >LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b>. The test user
ID .profile was used for the first implementation of this variable
as well. Once I had proven to myself it was safe, I moved the
variables to an environment file, where they had a more global
effect. I did not use the /etc/ld.so.preload file. Be sure you can
recover your system before you start configuring these environment
variables.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3640f1.large.jpg"><img src="3640f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1663580.0x175c688"></a>Documentation</h2></div></div><p>In general, the Code Fusion documentation is clear and
concise. I do have a couple of minor complaints, though. The manual
is primarily a composite of extracts from the Source Navigator
&ldquo;User's Reference Guide&rdquo; and the GNUPro Toolkit &ldquo;Getting
Started&rdquo; manual. Some new pages cover the integrated and new
features. The manual highlights basic Source Navigator interface
characteristics, and after highlighting the characteristic, the
reader is then referred to the Source Navigator's &ldquo;User's
Reference Guide&rdquo; for more details. Other parts of the Code Fusion
manual directed the reader to Source Navigator's &ldquo;Programmer's
Reference Guide&rdquo;. The author of this manual seemed to be working
under the assumption that a Code Fusion owner already owned a copy
of Source Navigator. This premise may be true for a short while
after the initial release of Code Fusion. Once Code Fusion has been
on the market for a while, this premise will no longer be valid.
Code Fusion documentation should be able to stand on its own. The
author shouldn't count on the buyer of Code Fusion already owning a
copy of GNUPro or Source Navigator.</p><p>The on-line Code Fusion documentation resembles the manual
information. I was unable to locate the on-line Source Navigator or
GNUPro documentation that was often referenced in the Code Fusion
manual. Within the on-line documentation are references to
unavailable user guides. For example, the &ldquo;Launching the Insight
Debugger&rdquo; topic referred the reader to the GNUPro Getting Started
Guide. No hyperlink to the referenced Guide was present, and I was
unable to locate the document in the product install directories.
At a minimum, I feel the proper reference documentation should be
made available in either hard copy or on-line.</p><p>The Code Fusion product contains GNUPro and other
GNU-licensed products. Chapter 2 has eighteen pages of general
license and terms for use and distribution of applications created
with the Code Fusion IDE. Reviewing the various licensing terms and
conditions is worth the time it takes. The rest of the manual is
devoted to describing how to use the basic Source Navigator and
GNUPro Toolkit interfaces.</p><p>Six demonstration projects are included with Code Fusion: one
for COBOL, FORTRAN, C++, Assembly, Java and a program called
<span   class="bold"><b>monop</b></span>. The monop program is used
for Code Fusion demonstration purposes. There are supposed to be
README files for the other demonstration projects, but I was unable
to locate several of them. The README files I did locate did not
provide any useful information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1663580.0x175c8f0"></a>Support</h2></div></div><p>As with other Cygnus products, 30 days of installation
support is included with your purchase. Cygnus also maintains a
Code Fusion support web site. The web site was still under
construction at the time of this writing. When I visited the site,
I found a FAQ, bug list and a patch database. A developer
discussion forum and a couple of other features were listed as
&ldquo;coming soon&rdquo; and may be implemented by the time this review is
published.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1663580.0x175c9f8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Overall, I feel Cygnus did a great job of integrating the two
products into an application IDE. I found Code Fusion easy to use
and easy to navigate around. The interface between Source Navigator
and GNUPro worked very smoothly. Code Fusion's management of
project files takes only a couple of mouse clicks to add, delete or
apply revision control. Please note, there is a slight IDE learning
curve if you have not used either the Source Navigator or GNUPro
Toolkit products.</p><p>Before paying list price, check on what upgrade paths are
being offered. At the time I wrote this, Cygnus was offering three
upgrade paths. Each offered a significant savings over the
product's list price.</p></div></div>
