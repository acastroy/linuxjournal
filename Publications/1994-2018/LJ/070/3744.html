    Ready to jazz up your KDE desktop&mdash;get KDE 2.0.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x294d580.0x2a455b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The KDE team is working full steam on the
next release of the K Desktop Environment which is planned for
spring 2000, so it is time to look at what the new version will
have in store.
</p><p>When you first install one of the beta releases and use a
plain old setting, you will probably not notice much difference
between KDE 1.1 and KDE 2.0. However, the more you explore, the
more you will find things that have changed. Also, many changes
have been made under the hood.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x294d580.0x2a45710"></a>Java Support</h2></div></div><p>Let's start with some of the core components. As a
programmer, you might be interested to hear that the library
interface has been cleaned up. As a user, this probably won't
interest you half as much as the fact that the web browser now
supports JavaScript and Java. The Java support is not bound to any
particular implementation of the JVM; you can use any fully
compliant implementation. We do our testing with the blackdown port
of the Sun JDK, but barring some bugs, you should also be able to
use kaffe, for example. Also notable is that not just the HTML
widget and applications can use Java&mdash;any KDE application can now
embed a Java applet in its windows. JavaScript support was partly
available in KDE 1.1 already, but it was so rudimentary no one
really used it. KDE 2.0 features an all-new implementation that is
much more complete; it enables you to view 90% of all web pages
using JavaScript.</p><p>Speaking of the browser, the whole HTML widget, i.e., the
part that is responsible for all HTML display, has been completely
rewritten. In particular, the display of tables as well as the
speed has been greatly improved and the internal structure now
conforms to DOM, the Document Object Model put forth by the World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The HTML display component is fully
HTML4-compliant, and&mdash;if the patent dispute between the W3C and
Microsoft is sorted out&mdash;will most likely support CSS1.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3744f1.large.jpg"><img src="3744f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Device Manager</p></div></div>
</p><p>The KDE web browser/file manager has been renamed Konqueror.
The name choice is obvious: history tells us the conqueror always
comes after the navigator and the explorer. It has also become more
flexible. The KDE PostScript viewer
<span   class="bold"><b>kghostscript</b></span> and the KDE DVI
viewer <span   class="bold"><b>kdvi</b></span> can now be used in
Konqueror. The same goes for the information and help page viewers,
and more can be easily integrated in the future.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x294d580.0x2a45b88"></a>Kwin and Kicker</h2></div></div><p>Two more core components have been completely re-implemented:
the window manager, now called
<span   class="bold"><b>kwin</b></span>, and the panel, now called
<span   class="bold"><b>kicker</b></span>.
<span   class="bold"><b>kwin</b></span> is much more flexible than
the old <span   class="bold"><b>kwm</b></span>, thanks to its very
modular design. For example, it will be possible for applications
to ask the window manager for decorations of internal windows. This
is useful for applications like StarOffice that use the &ldquo;window
manager in a window&rdquo; paradigm. Until now, these applications have
had to emulate the look-and-feel of one window manager, which was
awkward for users who used another manager on their desktop. For
KDE 2.0, this feature is still disabled, because it wasn't tested
enough. However, the code is there and will make its way into one
of the following releases. The author of kwin, Matthias Ettrich, is
working with other notable window manager authors on a common
window manager specification (the so-called NET protocol), so that
window managers on Linux will be easier to exchange in the future.
As with KDE 1.1, you can run KDE with window managers other than
kwin, but you may lose some functionality.</p><p>As for kicker, the new panel, it will be extremely easy to
write applets that either run inside it or stand alone. This was
already possible with <span   class="bold"><b>kpanel</b></span>, but
with kicker, the burden for the developer has been eased even more.
Also, applications can now dynamically add or remove submenus in
the K menu at runtime. The taskbar can be included inside the panel
(many people wanted that), and the whole panel can be dragged
around on the screen. It is much more configurable than the old
one.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x294d580.0x2a45ea0"></a>Customization of the Desktop</h2></div></div><p></p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3744f2.large.jpg"><img src="3744f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Theme Designer</p></div></div>
</p><p>So far, KDE has had the reputation of being stable and solid,
but a bit boring when it comes to looks. This has completely
changed. KDE 1.1.2 already contained some theme ability and a theme
manager; KDE 2.0 can be graphically customized in any way you
like&mdash;the possibilities are limitless (see Figure 2). Everything
from a very basic and subdued look to a completely Gothic desktop
is possible. It's up to you and your artistic capabilities, but of
course, there are many ready-made themes for you to try (see
<a href="http://kde.themes.org" target="_self">http://kde.themes.org/</a>).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x294d580.0x2a46268"></a>Kparts and DCOP</h2></div></div><p>When starting the development of KDE 2.0, the KDE team was
focusing on using CORBA, the Common Object Request Broker
Architecture, a middleware framework for distributed object
communication. However, during development it turned out that while
CORBA is a cleanly designed architecture useful for large and
high-latency things such as corporate databases, it is not so
well-suited for tasks such as user interfaces where speedy
responses are needed. There are several reasons for this. CORBA is
distributed in nature, which is very good if you need distributed
objects, but more of a burden than a gain if you don't need
them&mdash;and you don't need them in an office suite. Also, CORBA is
too static. In a desktop, objects and applications come and go all
the time. This is very hard to track reliably with CORBA.</p><p>Thus, the KDE team had to find something else in two areas.
KOffice needed a new underpinning for embedding applications into
each other and general desktop communication between the control
center and the applications. Something more lightweight was needed,
and this led to two new inventions that are now used in KDE 2.0:
KParts and DCOP.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3744f3.large.jpg"><img src="3744f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. KSpread</p></div></div>
</p><p>KParts is the new object framework used in KOffice for
embedding application windows into each other. You can, for
example, embed a spreadsheet window from KSpread into the word
processor window from KWord, just as you could with the previous
development versions. Since all KOffice components are now simple
shared libraries and the whole document is handled in the same
process, this happens much faster and smoother than before.
Actually, the previous embedding framework was so slow (and buggy)
it was hardly ever used. With KParts, there is no speed difference
between working on the container part (the word processor in our
example) and the embedded part (the spreadsheet in our example). In
addition, embedded views can now be tilted, twisted, rotated and
sheared, something which to our knowledge is not available on any
other platform. I'll talk more about KOffice a bit later in this
article.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3744f4.large.jpg"><img src="3744f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. KWord</p></div></div>
</p><p>DCOP, which stands for Desktop Communication Protocol and is
pronounced &ldquo;dee-cop&rdquo;, is the other new communication facility.
DCOP uses a standard mechanism, ICE from X11R6. ICE was written
mainly by the X developers to implement session management, but as
it turned out, it can also be used for other things. Since it is
standard, available in all X11R6 implementations (including
XFree86), fast and lightweight, it was a natural choice. For those
interested, communication between processes in ICE is done via
either UNIX domain sockets, TCP/IP sockets or DECnet. DCOP is just
a thin layer on top that handles the marshaling of data and makes
sure all communication streams reach their destination. You can
imagine DCOP as a traffic cop who stands in the middle of a road
crossing and directs the cars into their lanes, so that everyone
reaches their destination, no accidents occur and no passengers end
up in the wrong cars. (Okay, this is where the analogy breaks
down.)</p><p>DCOP is used in KDE to unify the different communication
means, like X atoms for communication between the control center
and the application or TCP/IP sockets. In KDE 2.0, developers need
to learn only about DCOP and can forget about X atoms and other
communication means. Also, since DCOP is based on the X11R6
standard ICE and is open and documented, it is not bound to KDE.
Non-KDE applications that wish to take part in these communication
channels can either link directly to the KDE implementation of DCOP
or easily implement a compatible implementation themselves. Also,
there is already an XML-RPC-to-DCOP bridge, and people are working
on a general IIOP-DCOP bridge as well. XML-RPC is especially
interesting, because it will allow scripting the whole desktop from
just about any language you like, including /bin/sh.</p><p>This does not mean KDE has completely dropped CORBA; the KDE
team just has a much more judicious view on where CORBA is useful
and where it is not. There are areas where CORBA is still deemed
useful; one of them is the new KDE multimedia framework
<span   class="bold"><b>aRts</b></span>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x294d580.0x2a469a0"></a>Multimedia</h2></div></div><p>In the current version, aRts is an audio server and mixer
that can handle many different incoming audio streams,
manipulating, mixing and outputting them to an audio device like an
ordinary sound card. At the KDE developers' conference KDE II in
early October in Erlangen, Germany, aRts' main author Stefan
Westerfeld gave a very impressive demo of aRts mixing two MP3
streams: one of them manipulated with additional sound effects and
one synthesized in real time from the MIDI events being played on a
MIDI keyboard.</p><p>Again, CORBA has to be used judiciously. For a full-blown
multimedia application like Brahms, the KDE synthesizer, CORBA is
the right tool. For a non-multimedia-oriented application that just
wants to play a warning beep when something goes wrong or a lengthy
background task is finished, CORBA is way too much, especially
since this application would have to link to the full CORBA
machinery just to play its beep. This is why aRts also provides a
lightweight, raw TCP/IP-based mechanism for playing simple .wav
files. (The applications cannot do this themselves because on
Linux, only one application at a time can open a sound device.)
Also, the KDE team is evaluating another alternative, MCOP, the
Multimedia Communication Protocol. By the time you read this, it
may have turned out that MCOP is better suited for this task than
CORBA, and if it is better, then it will probably already be in use
for aRts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x294d580.0x2a46b00"></a>Configuration Files</h2></div></div><p>Now let's go back to some more basic components. The KDE
configuration files have always been pure text files. This had the
advantage that nothing could go corrupt&mdash;you could, if necessary,
edit the text files by hand or use a Perl script to change the
configuration files of a few hundred users at once. So, text-based
configuration files are desirable. However, a typical KDE desktop
has hundreds of these files not only for each application, but also
for each MIME type, each service type and so on. This led to slow
application startup, because all these files had to be opened and
parsed. The solution to this is KSycoca, the KDE system
configuration cache. KSycoca is a sort of daemon running in the
background and watching for changes in the configuration files.
KSycoca reads all configuration files and builds a binary database
which can be accessed much faster than the individual, text-based
files. However, those are still the authoritative source of all
configuration information, so you can edit them by hand or by
scripts. In case anything goes wrong with KSycoca, it can simply
dump its database, because it is nothing more than a cache and
contains no information unavailable elsewhere. Compare that to
operating systems with binary registers which can get messed up so
badly you cannot boot up your operating system!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x294d580.0x2a46c08"></a>Koffice</h2></div></div><p></p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3744f5.large.jpg"><img src="3744f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5. Kpresenter</p></div></div>
</p><p>We have already talked about some internal changes in
KOffice. The development of new features is also progressing.
Implementing import filters is a very hard task, but Werner Trobin
has already made some progress, so there is hope that KWord (see
Figure 4) will be able to import Word 97 documents in the not too
distant future. KPresenter (see Figure 5) now supports presentation
templates, and KSpread (see Figure 3) has also received many more
features too numerous to list here&mdash;check it out yourself. However,
there are (besides the &ldquo;old&rdquo; applications KSpread, KWord,
KPresenter, KIllustrator, KChart and KFormula) two new kids on the
block. KImageShop is a multi-threaded image-manipulation program
that aims at being as powerful as the GIMP, but easier to use.
Also, KImageShop has a very clean C++ design that will make
extensions much easier. KImageShop will not be ready for public use
any time soon, but shows some very promising results. Finally,
<span   class="bold"><b>kdatabase</b></span> is a database front end
that aims at making database power more accessible for the end
user, and of course, features embedding into other KOffice
applications.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x294d580.0x2a3d860"></a>KDevelop</h2></div></div><p>KDevelop, the KDE Integrated Development Environment (IDE),
is one of the sub-projects that is perhaps making the most
progress. By the time you read this, version 1.0 should be out, and
it features, among other new things, support for Objective-C and a
very nice class tree view. KDevelop's development is a bit
decoupled from KDE, i.e., it does not follow the same release
plans. However, the KDevelop people put much effort into ensuring
KDevelop always works with the current KDE versions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x294d580.0x2a3d968"></a>Documentation</h2></div></div><p>Another important change comes from the documentation team.
All the documentation is moving from the LinuxDoc SGML DTD to the
more powerful and professional DocBook DTD that most professional
publishers use. This move is also being executed by the LinuxDoc
people, so that DocBook will become the pre-eminent standard for
Linux documentation in the future.</p><p>All those changes, new features and new applications,
impressive as they may seem, are simply nothing against the one
true KDE killer application that has appeared recently:
<span   class="bold"><b>ky</b></span>, the KDE implementation of the
classic UNIX <span   class="bold"><b>yes</b></span> tool!</p></div></div>
