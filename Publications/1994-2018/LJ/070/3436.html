more people becoming exposed to it, a proliferation of new network
and Internet-specific software is coming out, giving potential
buyers a confusing array of software from which to choose. Free web
hosting and &ldquo;free e-mail for life&rdquo; sites now number in the
hundreds at least, and seem to be multiplying daily. Most companies
now require Internet access, including at least a corporate web
site and employee e-mail. Many sites are either running NT and the
Microsoft Solution for mail and web services, or using UNIX systems
such as Sendmail along with a POP3 or IMAP server. After all,
Sendmail has been with us for ages, and it's something most UNIX
administrators are familiar with. MS Exchange and Sendmail pretty
much dominate most mail-server markets today, so why change?
Stalker Software
(<a href="http://www.stalker.com" target="_self">http://www.stalker.com/</a>),
a company with a background in Macintoshes and mail software,
intends to change all that with their CommuniGate Pro (CGP) mail
server.
</p><p>While Stalker appears to have their work cut out for them,
they are also off to a good start. The company has received
numerous awards for the CGP product, ranging from <span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX
Review</em></span> to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux World</em></span> Editor's
Choice. Not being content to blindly listen to others' reviews, I
sat down to install CGP on my mail server running Red Hat 6.0. If
you don't use UNIX for your mail server, they've got you covered
there as well. CGP runs on a broad range of platforms, including
most UNIX variants, Mac OS X Server and Windows, and is currently
in version 3.1 as of this writing, with a 3.2 beta available for
testing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a98580.0x2b90c90"></a>Installation, Configuration and
Administration</h2></div></div><p>Installation is fairly straightforward for all versions I've
tested, those being Red Hat 5.2 and 6.0 (RPM and tgz) and Windows
NT 4 Server. For review purposes, I'll be concentrating on the
Linux version, although everything aside from the installation
itself should apply across all platforms. The install script adds
its init scripts for startup and shutdown, replaces the mail binary
with a CGP-compatible version, and you're off and running. We're
not done yet, though. Stalker realizes many users will be migrating
from another system, such as an IMAP or POP server. CGP/Stalker
provides some simple tools to import users and mailboxes, which can
mean the difference between a relatively quick and easy
installation, or an all-day (or longer) process for companies with
hundreds or thousands of users. You can, of course, also add users
manually. Users can even be imported/created via a simple text
file, which can easily be made from your password file.</p><p>Once the server is up and running, administration is normally
handled via a web interface. For the more security-conscious, a
nice feature is that with versions 3.1 and later, this can be done
via an SSL web connection. For the truly stubborn, it can also be
configured via text files. While I am not a fan of web interfaces,
this one is quite good. On-line HTML help is part of the system and
just a click away. Earlier versions had pointed to the Stalker web
site, but now all documentation is available locally. Mail domains
and routing, access rules, log levels and all configuration is
easily done. It does take a while to become used to getting around
the interface the way it's laid out, as well as learn some of their
terms, so the help does come in handy for the more unusual
features.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a98580.0x2b90df0"></a>Features, Features, Features</h2></div></div><p>After the initial configuration is done, you have a large
number of choices to make. For the most part, the defaults may be
acceptable and are enough to get the system up and running, but the
fact that this is certainly no trimmed-down mail server becomes
readily apparent once you spend some time in the Admin screen. You
have quite a few options, such as allowing web-based mail access,
using SSL, allowing IMAP, POP, ACAP and PWD clients, maximum number
of connections allowed, log rotation and levels, mailing-list
configuration, blacklisted domains and more. Most of these will
already be familiar to mail administrators, and others may be new
to some. Administrators may also limit system resources, message
size, allowable services, and web space on a per user/list or per
domain basis, as well as setting new defaults.</p><p>A <span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> nice feature is server-wide
rules, which allow us to bid adieu to fighting with procmail
recipes. Or perhaps not&mdash;the rules also allow the execution of
external scripts, if you so choose. They allow anything from simple
redirections to auto-replies using the sender's information inside
of the reply message.</p><p>An LDAP module is included as part of CGP. CGP also provides
its own web server module, allowing users to create their own web
sites and update them via the Web Mail interface. The list goes on
and on&mdash;after using CGP for several months, I'm sure there are yet
more pleasant surprises to be discovered.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a98580.0x2b91000"></a>Customization</h2></div></div><p>One of the nicer features about CGP is the ability to
customize. You decide which services you want to provide or allow,
based on per domain or per user. You could allow only secure
connections, or restrict connections via IP or domain. And the web
interface, including the web actions dictated by each link, may be
customized to suit your taste. The default Web Mail configuration
is acceptable for most intranets, but ISPs and free e-mail sites
would certainly want to add their own layouts. This seems to be
easily accomplished, based on feedback I've seen on the CGP mailing
list, including the use of custom CGI scripts, or choosing from
ones available on the Stalker web site. Future upgrades will leave
your changes intact, but use common sense; always make a
backup.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a98580.0x2b91108"></a>The Web Interface</h2></div></div><p>It's inevitable&mdash;everyone has seen it. Most of us have one
somewhere or another. Some people love it, some hate it&mdash;web mail
is here to stay, and can make life much easier for those on the
road or otherwise remotely accessing e-mail. The default web mail
configuration is usable, but has some quirks and annoyances. To be
fair here, so do Yahoo, Hotmail and the like. The web interface can
be customized almost to your heart's content, and it does provide
some nice features. I have not done any customization, but several
commercial customers on the CGP list seem to have had success with
it. Therefore, any comments here are about the default interface
only.</p><p>Users are able to configure their web-mail settings to
include sort order, number of messages to display per screen, which
mailboxes to display, signature and reply formats and too many
other things to cover here, but suffice to say it's quite nice.
Users also have the option of polling external mailboxes via POP3,
and as an added bonus, can use the web interface to upload and
maintain their personal web site. A user may also define his own
rules, using the same options as the server-wide rules&mdash;an option
any user subscribed to mailing lists will definitely
appreciate.</p><p>All is not perfection, however; a few annoyances remain, most
notably the default &ldquo;Delete&rdquo; and &ldquo;Next Unread&rdquo; operations. Upon
deleting a viewed message, a user is brought back to the Mailbox,
rather than the more usual behavior of moving on to the next unread
message without requiring user intervention. The &ldquo;Next Unread&rdquo;
seems to ignore any sort order a user has specified and moves on to
the next unread message in its mail file rather than using the sort
order for displaying messages. This may sound minor, but it can be
quite frustrating with a folder containing a lot of unread
messages. The Delete behavior can (thankfully) be fixed easily by
making a minor change to the HTML.</p><p>The last remaining quirk relates to the way some mail clients
send web pages as attachments. Under some circumstances, the user
is confronted with a message about &ldquo;Embedded Web Pages&rdquo; and his
browser being unable to display in-line frames. So far, Netscape
Messenger and Outlook Express produce the same result. When this
happens, the user must click on a link to launch another browser
window in order to view it. Hopefully, this will be fixed
shortly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a98580.0x2b91318"></a>Users, Lists and Normal Operations</h2></div></div><p>I've used everything from Pine to Netscape and Outlook to
retrieve mail from CGP and have yet to run into a problem using
these clients via IMAP or POP3. Mailing lists are easy to set up,
and also allow accessing them via the Web. They can be configured
to automatically digest and support the typical features under
traditional list servers such as majordomo, allowing for both
moderated and unmoderated, public and private lists. The help
files, list notifications and bounce processing are easily
configured and customizable.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a98580.0x2b91420"></a>The Good</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>easy installation &amp; administration</p></li><li><p>many tools and features</p></li><li><p>highly customizable</p></li><li><p>thorough administration package</p></li><li><p>mail transport agent and web e-mail service</p></li><li><p>retrieves POP3 or IMAP</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a98580.0x2b91948"></a>The Bad</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>next unread operation is disorganized</p></li><li><p>delete operation exits folder</p></li><li><p>web page attachments are problematic</p></li></ul></div><p>Day-to-day administration is minimal, since the log rotation
and most tasks are handled for you (once configured). A note of
caution is in order, however; the logs can get quite large if all
data is being logged, so after determining the server is in working
order, logging policies should probably be altered. A &ldquo;Monitors&rdquo;
section of the Admin interface allows you to watch all active
connections via the Web and other protocols and view any logs,
including filtered logging by content or time. One minor complaint
is the log is displayed in reverse order with the most recent
events displayed at the bottom of the page, which may be off the
screen. A nice addition would be to send a notification if more
connections are being requested than are configured, to enable
system administrators to determine more easily when they may need
to allow more connections or upgrade hardware. Aside from that,
most administrators should rarely need to use the monitors section
as the system practically runs itself, but it's good to know it's
there.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a98580.0x2b91cb8"></a>Target Audience</h2></div></div><p>With the abundance of features packed into CGP, it may sound
a bit overwhelming to some system administrators at first, but let
me assure you this is most certainly <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the
case. Most features are easily configured, and if you don't need a
particular service, don't run it. Click a checkbox and it's
off&mdash;it's that simple. The Web Mail interface obviously targets
free e-mail services akin to Yahoo! and Hotmail, but it is much
more than just Web Mail and should be equally at home in small
companies, ISPs or large enterprise networks. For those interested
in using it as a free web mail server, header and trailer fields
are allowed to be set. I've seen people quote anywhere from a dozen
to over 100,000 users on the mailing list so far, and just in case
you want to support more users, CGP also has a &ldquo;Cluster&rdquo; option
that allows you to use multiple servers in tandem.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a98580.0x2b886a8"></a>Customer Feedback&mdash;Some First-Hand
Comments</h2></div></div><p>Software evaluations and reviews often leave out an important
part&mdash;real-world use. A quick e-mail to the mailing list yielded
several responses from different companies currently using CGP,
ranging from a school with 1200 or so accounts to several companies
using the web interfaces for free e-mail services supporting tens
of thousands of users.</p><p>Ofer Tanenbaum of Zipmail
(<a href="http://www.zipmail.com" target="_self">http://www.zipmail.com/</a>),
which offers a free web-based e-mail service, says Zipmail already
has over 20,000 users and is growing daily, running on an
Intel-based FreeBSD server with less than .07 CPU load and over 100
concurrent connections. Zipmail had tried EIMS and Appleshare IP
previously, and Tanenbaum had some personal experience with MS
Exchange. His overall impression? &ldquo;Bottom line, nothing to
compare.&rdquo;</p><p>MauiMail
(<a href="http://www.MauiMail.com" target="_self">http://www.MauiMail.com/</a>)
is also using CGP for web-based e-mail and has been running CGP for
about a year, on an Apple G3/450. An employee of MauiMail, Darly
Hansen, claims it to be &ldquo;much smoother than our previous system.
Very stable.&rdquo; Most other responses I've gotten from the list tend
to agree.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a98580.0x2b88910"></a>Pricing and Support</h2></div></div><p>Pricing is free for a trial version and starts at $499 to
license 50 users, 1000 accounts at $1999, on up to $30,000 for
unlimited accounts and lists. Support packages vary, but free
support via e-mail is included, with additional packages ranging
from five incidents through unlimited 24x7 with guaranteed on-site
support at varying costs. I've monitored the mailing list for
several months, and for the most part problems are answered the
same day, sometimes within hours, including on weekends.</p><p>Some of the list members have been doing heavy customization
to the system, mainly the Web Mail configuration. While not always
able to resolve an issue immediately or the first time in some
cases, there almost always seems to be a way to do what the
customer wants.</p><p>The documentation does a good job as well, but can be a bit
overwhelming in size. On-line help is available to the
administrator and users alike through the web interface. The list
also serves as a place to make feature requests, and staff members
at Stalker are very motivated to keep their customers happy.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a98580.0x2b88ac8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Many products in the past have tried to be all things to all
people, ranging from Windows and all its permutations to the
different groups working on making Linux alternately either a
desktop OS or a server OS. Most have mixed results, giving up
something in trying to be too many things. Surprisingly, this is
not the case with CommuniGate Pro. With its abundance of features
and ease of administration, it practically runs itself once
configured and is up to any task you may ask of it. If you need a
feature, chances are there's already a way to do it, or it's coming
soon. So, is it perfect? No. However, while it could use a few
tweaks here and there, most are minor, which is all the more
impressive considering the scope of the product. So who needs
Exchange or cryptic Sendmail and procmail configuration? Not me,
I'll take my CommuniGate Pro!</p></div></div>
