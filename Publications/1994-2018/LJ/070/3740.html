    The ultimate in recording television programs, TiVo is a
    set-top box that does everything for you.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3740f1.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2488580.0x25806b8"></a></h2></div></div><p> TiVo, Inc., headquartered in Sunnyvale,
California, is the creator of the Personal TV Receiver. Michael
Ramsay and James Barton founded TiVo in August of 1997. Ramsay and
Barton were senior executives at Silicon Graphics, involved with
early generation interactive video-on-demand systems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2488580.0x25807c0"></a>Personal TV Receiver</h2></div></div><p>The Philips Personal TV (PTV) Receiver is a joint effort
between TiVo and Philips Electronics. Philips Electronics
manufactures the PowerPC-based hardware, and TiVo designs and
develops the software. The appliance uses a modified version of
Linux for PowerPC and provides an amazing set of features. It truly
is the next generation of VCRs, allowing you to watch what you
want, when you want.</p><p>TiVo's PTV Receiver does have competition in this emerging
market, such as Replay TV. However, the PTV Receiver is currently
the only Linux-based system.</p><p>You can still do all the things you do with a VCR with the
PTV Receiver&mdash;except play a VHS tape, of course. However, with DVDs
becoming increasing popular, this may not be a significant
limitation for you.</p><p>TiVo records digitally using MPEG II compression at one of
four selectable video qualities. Picture quality at the best
setting is as good as the original broadcast, an improvement over
VCR technology. Although you can't exchange your recordings with
others without copying them from TiVo to a VCR, you won't have to
manage a handful of two-hour tapes, either.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3740f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. TiVo Central
</p></div></div><p>TiVo takes the concept of on-screen programming a step
further. Rather than just recording what you schedule, TiVo allows
you to rate, with either a thumbs up or down, programs you watch.
TiVo will then record shows you've scheduled and shows it finds
that match your preferences (see Figures 1 and 2.)</p><p>If you happen to watch <span   class="emphasis"><em>Friends</em></span> on
Thursday night and give it a thumbs up, TiVo will also record
syndicated reruns without being scheduled. What if the TV network
switches your program to another night? TiVo will record it
automatically at its new time slot, with no programming required.
This is made possible by TiVo's built-in program listings, updated
nightly by an automated toll-free phone call.</p><p>TiVo also enhances your TV watching. TiVo maintains 30
minutes of what's currently being watched, so you can pause,
fast-forward or rewind live TV.</p><p>For example, if you're watching your favorite NFL team on
Sunday, push the instant replay button on TiVo's remote and the
action will skip back eight seconds and begin playing. Push the
jump button, and you're back to live TV.</p><p>If you miss the start of a program, you can watch from the
beginning while TiVo records the rest of the show.</p><p>Not sure what to watch? TiVo will provide you with
recommendations based on your preferences. The interactive
on-screen listing means you'll never have to pick up another
printed TV guide.</p><p>A limitation of the current system is that it is unable to
establish individual profiles for each viewer. Instead, TiVo
creates a preferences profile for the household as a whole.</p><p>Having won a &ldquo;Best of What's New&rdquo; award for 1999 from
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Popular Science</em></span>, the Personal TV Receiver is
getting positive reviews from both audio/video and computer
professionals. Ziff-Davis' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Equip</em></span> product
reviewer summarized it like this: &ldquo;TiVo rocks! I've been testing
it for a few weeks and can't imagine living without it.&rdquo;</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3740f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

capability and developer tools were among the factors that prompted
TiVo to select Linux. The availability of a PowerPC port of Linux
was crucial, since TiVo runs on a PowerPC-based system.</p><p>The current system is based on the 2.1.24 kernel. The GNU
toolset and Tcl were used to develop all software.</p><p>TiVo had to modify the Linux kernel and some open-source
tools in order to develop their product. In particular, they added
an unbuffered scatter/gather API for disk access, real-time disk
scheduling capability, an advanced DMA management subsystem, and
support for demand paging and real-time processing. The unbuffered
disk access allows the system to handle power outages gracefully.
Users won't ever have to worry about waiting for
<span   class="bold"><b>fsck</b></span> to repair the file
system.</p><p>The TiVo receiver can update its software automatically. This
includes both the TiVo application as well as the Linux kernel that
drives the system.</p><p>During one of its nightly calls to get TV programming
information, it will automatically download and install software
updates. No user interaction is required.</p><p>A recent upgrade improved the picture quality during
fast-forward and improved the algorithm for recommending programs.
While certainly not new to PC software (America Online and others
have been doing this for years), self-updating software is fairly
new to consumer devices.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2488580.0x2581420"></a>Product Specifications</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>PowerPC-based Linux</p></li><li><p>Stores 14-30 hours</p></li><li><p>Inputs: cable-ready tuner, S-video and composite
