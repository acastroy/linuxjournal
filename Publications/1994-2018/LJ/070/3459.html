    Come up to the lab and see what's on the slab&mdash;I mean,
    slide.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb2f580.0xc278c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Aging Research Centre (ARC) is
developing an Automated Imaging Microscope System (AIMS) to enable
researchers to view the three-dimensional cellular organization of
a region of tissue from a series of microscope slides. AIMS employs
a computer-controlled microscope that can move a microscope slide
along the X and Y axes, so that the field of view can be moved in
equal increments. The microscope also has an autofocus mechanism. A
CCD camera captures images, one field of view at a time. Using a
magnification of 400 power, a typical slide contains 25,000 fields
of view; perhaps 7000 of those fields contain something of
interest. By using the thousands of individually captured images,
the system is able to reconstruct a very high-resolution image of
the entire slide.
</p><p>AIMS analyzes each of the thousands of images and identifies
and stores the following attributes for each cell it was instructed
to identify: X,Y and Z coordinates for each desired cell type,
amount of each stain in the cell, type of each stain in the cell,
color of each stain in the cell and type of cell.</p><p>When AIMS has processed multiple layers of a tissue block,
the system will be able to reconstruct a three-dimensional map of
the cells in that block. In an experiment where there are two
groups of animals and the researcher wishes to compare tissues from
the two groups, AIMS will be able to compare three-dimensional
structures as well as cell counts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb2f580.0xc27a80"></a>The Implementation</h2></div></div><p>The system has two very different functions: acquisition and
analysis. When we designed the system, we started on both ends
simultaneously, attempting to analyze images captured from other
sources, then working on our own data. Because we hope for the
system to be used by biology researchers, not UNIX gurus, a decent
user interface is one of the primary goals. We chose Tcl/Tk for the
ease with which a GUI can be developed. The easily modifiable
prototypes are useful. Various commands, written in C (but with
Tcl/Tk interfaces) are used to control physical devices.</p><p>Physically, the system consists of an optical microscope, a
CCD camera and three stepper motors hooked to the parallel port.
The stepper motors move a microscope slide around the stage under
computer control; basically, we have a 60,000bpi scanner.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb2f580.0xc27be0"></a>Stepper Motors</h2></div></div><p>The stepper motors are driven by Darlington-pair transistors
(see
<a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ih/doc/stepper" target="_self">http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ih/doc/stepper/</a>
for a discussion on stepper-motor control). This allows for great
control, at the expense of hefty timing requirements. In the Linux
kernel, we can find floppies driven every three to eight
milliseconds. Empirically, given the load on our motors, we can
sometimes move more than twice a second. We've hooked them up to
the parallel port. The parallel port has eight data lines and four
control lines which can be used for output. This is just sufficient
to control three stepper motors at four controls/motor. If we
needed more motors, we would have to use a different type of
controller. Figure 1 shows the microscope looking at the focus
mechanism. Figure 2 shows the circuit driving the motors. It uses
two ULN2003A chips and is powered by a spare computer power
supply.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3459f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Microscope
</p></div></div><p>We need to do a lot of moving, so speed is very important.
Using <span   class="bold"><b>nanosleep</b></span> seems the
simplest, if not the best, alternative. Combined with real-time
priority, this causes the motors to move with a nice smooth hum.
The other alternative, using the real-time clock at 2048KHz,
doesn't allow as precise a control over speed. The major problem
with this approach is the way nanosleep handles its delays. A
busy-wait prevents any other task from running. RTLinux does seem
like a better solution, although we haven't investigated that yet.
The older <span   class="bold"><b>usleep</b></span> call is a poor
choice, as it has 10ms granularity.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3459f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Circuit that Drives Motors
</p></div></div><p>The greatest problem is figuring out the speed to move the
motor. The speed at which a stepper motor is capable of moving
depends on the load placed on it, and this load varies depending on
the friction in the stage. A speed that works at one location may
not work at all at another. Empirical experimentation seems
necessary.</p><p>We can move in three dimensions. Not only can we view the
entire slide, we can change the focus. A jury-rigged solution seems
to work&mdash;move up and down, and pick the image with the most detail.
We assume the one with the most detail is the most focused.
Technically, &ldquo;detail&rdquo; is based on a &ldquo;busyness&rdquo; function. For
each pixel, find the difference in intensity between each of its
neighbors, then sum the absolute value of those differences.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb2f580.0xc28268"></a>Frame Grabber</h2></div></div><p>Because this project started before Linux 2.2, which has
frame grabbers built into the kernel, we are using the Matrox
meteor frame grabber, which has support at
<a href="http://www.gnofn.org/~marksu/meteorman.html" target="_self">www.gnofn.org/~marksu/meteorman.html</a>.
The <span   class="bold"><b>mvid</b></span> program which comes with
the driver was a useful starting point. We integrated it with
Tcl/Tk. This allows us to make snapshots, view real-time video at
variable frame rates and sizes over our network and get measures
such as &ldquo;how dark is it?&rdquo; or &ldquo;how much detail is there?&rdquo; by
directly accessing frame-buffer memory.</p><p>Real-time video is useful for manual focus to check whether
autofocus is working, for setting boundaries of the scan, and of
course, for just joking around by taking pictures of staff members.
The &ldquo;meteor&rdquo; driver sends out a signal whenever a new image is
available. If we're ready, we will send the image out using
<span   class="bold"><b>XPutImage</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>XSync</b></span>. If the previous image isn't
done, we ignore the frame entirely.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb2f580.0xc28528"></a>Analysis</h2></div></div><p>While shape is important, size and color are simpler to use
as heuristics. We take a single image, then use sliders to select
the colors which we consider to be a cell. If it is big enough and
the right color, it must be a cell. This isn't a very sophisticated
technique; it isn't much of a refinement over &ldquo;thresholding&rdquo;,
where anything sufficiently dark is counted.</p><p>Currently, we use Tcl/Tk to select the ranges of RGB color
which will be allowed. In the future, it may be useful to select
regions in HSV color space.</p><p>The simplicity of the algorithm means cells can be counted
&ldquo;on the fly&rdquo;; during the scan, the algorithm is performed on each
field of view. The cells on the boundaries are counted multiple
times, but we know where the boundaries are and can ignore
them.</p><p>It would theoretically be possible to do this job without any
computer at all. A technician could look at each slide, 0.2 mm at a
time, and count every cell he saw. Looking at 2mm by 2mm sections,
this would require exhaustive work for the 100-odd fields covered
by a typical mouse hypothalamus. Fatigue could introduce bias. It
would be easy to count a given marginal case one way when wide
awake and another when tired&mdash;but people are good at image
processing, computers aren't. People make mistakes when they are
tired; computers make mistakes all the time. Still, even if
absolute numbers are biased, we hope that relative numbers will
still show useful differences.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb2f580.0xc28738"></a>User Interfaces Scanner</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3459f3.large.jpg"><img src="3459f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Overview of Slide
</p></div></div><p>There are currently two interfaces to the physical
&ldquo;scanner&rdquo;: one for grabbing an overview (see Figure 3) of the
entire slide, at 25 bits per inch (i.e., the microscope's objective
is moved 1mm at a time, and the average color at that point is
saved), and another for grabbing a specified region on the slide.
In the second case, because of the low speed of directory listings
(<span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> takes quite a bit of time if
there are 2000 files), a directory is created for every column
scanned. Figure 4 shows the interface used to scan in a rectangular
region. The user can use the cursor keys to move the slide, and
then select the boundaries.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3459f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Scan Interface
</p></div></div><p>One planned refinement is to scan in only those areas which
we think may have useful content. If locations (x,y), (x+1mm,y),
(x,y+1mm), (x+1mm,y+1mm) are all blank, it is reasonable (given the
size of our samples) to ignore (x+0.5mm, y+0.5mm).</p><p>The optimal refinement would be to store only the regions
which actually have useful content. In our case, we are interested
in only the hypothalamus. An empty area is near this, which could
conceivably be automatically recognized; if so, we could discard
thousands of frames of less-important data.</p><p>It would be nice to store the entire slide in a standard
image format such as JPEG or TIFF, but for some reason,
12,5000x50,000-pixel images are difficult to process at 24 bits per
pixel (18GB per image seems a little excessive). Storing each frame
individually using JPEG uses 10-50KB per frame; more for detailed
ones, less for blanks. If only images with useful detail are saved,
it should get under 650MB/slide, in which case each slide might be
stored on a CD-ROM.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb2f580.0xc1f5a0"></a>Panner/Zoomer</h2></div></div><p>Given the non-standard format, we will need a way to view
individual segments on a slide. A multi-resolution display tool
uses preprocessed images from the slide to create a mosaic, which
shows multiple frames at the same time. By saving each frame at
multiple resolutions, we do not need to decompress hundreds of JPEG
images, only to throw 9999/10,000ths of the detail away.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3459f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5
</p></div></div><p>Using this tool, we can zoom out to view the entire slide,
zoom in on a specific region of a single sample, then view a
specific field of vision. Figure 5 is a mosaic of one portion of
one slide.</p><p>Refinements would allow integration with the counting
algorithm. By drawing a border around a region of interest, counts
and densities of cells in that region could be displayed.</p><p>When successive sections of the same tissue sample are placed
in a known sequence, those successive sections can be merged to
form a single three-dimensional image of the original tissue.
Distortions in the sample are likely to cause some difficulty, but
standard feature-recognition techniques should be able to
compensate.</p><p>A further refinement is possible. With cells ~25 microns in
size, 4 micron slices span several cells. By staining successive
sections with different factors, it is possible to determine
several different facts about each cell.</p><p>The Automated Imaging Microscope System (AIMS) will be used
by my colleague Lee R. McCook at the University of California at
Berkeley. He will use the system to compare the 3-D cellular
densities in the hypothalamus of normal mice and calorically
restricted mice. I have downloaded his Ph.D. proposal to the Aging
Research Centre's web site at
<a href="http://www.arclab.org/linux/leephd.html" target="_self">www.arclab.org/linux/leephd.html</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb2f580.0xc1fa70"></a>Final Thoughts</h2></div></div><p>ARC has two research facilities in North America: the first
is located in Berkeley, California and the second in Waterloo,
Ontario, Canada. The near-term objectives of the Aging Research
Centre are to conduct experiments that shed light on the underlying
mechanisms that cause the aging process to occur and to develop
tools which will help researchers better understand why humans and
other organisms undergo this process. Our long-term objective is to
use the information that has been accumulated on this subject and
develop intervention procedures that will dramatically slow down
the aging process. The aging of an organism is a very complex and
multifaceted process that encompasses many disciplines in biology
such as neuroendocrinology, histology, genetics, enzymology,
biochemistry, molecular biology and so on. At this time, there is
approximately 100GB of information in journals and books that
relates to the aging process, and more and more information is
being added every day to this body of knowledge. One of the tools
we are developing will allow a researcher to see this massive
quantity of data via a computer using graphical and interactive
methods in order to represent this information in a more
comprehensible and coherent manner.</p><p>The other major tool is the focus of this article: an
Automated Imaging Microscope System to be used for an experiment at
the University of California at Berkeley. It will be used to study
the effects of calorie deprivation on neural tissue. Mice on
calorie-reduced diets often live longer, and this may be based on
changes in the hypothalamus.</p></div></div>
