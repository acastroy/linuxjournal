    How to survive without Microsoft Word.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c6d580.0x1d653f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Life is not fair, is it? You learned how
to use Microsoft Word or Corel WordPerfect, only to find yourself
at a job where your boss says you must use LaTeX. What is this
thing? Can it be used for anything practical, like writing letters,
memos, reports, sending faxes or printing price lists? These are
some of the first questions that come to mind when you start using
it. Fortunately, with LaTeX, it is just as easy to typeset a
1,000-page book filled with mathematical formulae as it is to
prepare a short letter or a price list. These kinds of real-world
office applications are what we are going to discuss below.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c6d580.0x1d65500"></a>Not a Word Processor</h2></div></div><p>Probably the most common misconception about LaTeX is
thinking of it as some kind of text editor or word processor. It is
neither of those tools. Let me explain. When you start Word or
WordPerfect in Microsoft Windows or on a Macintosh, it opens a
window, displaying buttons, menus and a white space where what you
type shows up immediately on-screen and can be edited at will. To
display or print documents, word processors use an &ldquo;engine&rdquo; of
some sort that changes simple keystrokes into nice-looking type
according to your choice of font and style. LaTeX can be thought of
as such an engine, reading plaintext files on one end and changing
them into professional-looking documents and saving in its own
format called DVI on the other end.</p><p>Although LaTeX is only a <span   class="emphasis"><em>pure</em></span>
typesetting system (it is not a visual DTP package like Microsoft
Publisher, Adobe PageMaker or QuarkXPress) and the documents you
process must be created using a plaintext editor, the quality of
the documents generated in LaTeX are often much superior to Word's
own efforts. However, learning to typeset documents in the former
might be harder at first than doing it in the latter because of the
need to manually add control commands to the text, which some
people find confusing. You might think of it as an unnecessary
burden, but you should remember that in reality, all word
processors and text editors add control commands to the text you
type&mdash;they just don't make them visible to us.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c6d580.0x1d656b8"></a>Typing Your First Letter</h2></div></div><p>The best way to learn LaTeX is by example, so log in to your
system (in case you do not know what <span   class="emphasis"><em>logging
in</em></span> means, try some beginner Linux books) and type the
following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
emacs businessletter.latex
</pre><p>File extensions are optional and could be just about anything
you like, although using .latex or .tex is good practice, as it
makes documents easier to find.
</p><p>After pressing the <b  >ENTER</b> (or
<b  >RETURN</b>) key, you should see Emacs in all its
glory&mdash;two toolbars and an empty space waiting to be filled with
text. The \ character marks the beginning of LaTeX commands, so
remember to put it in as well, and do not get confused by a
<b  >\</b> showing up from time to time in the rightmost
column of the Emacs window&mdash;it's there to show you that a
particular line of text is longer than the width of the window and
has been wrapped. Let's type in the lines shown in Listing
1.</p><p><a href="3387l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>To save what you have just typed in, press the
<b  >CTRL-X</b> and <b  >S</b> keys. You should
see a message at the bottom of the window saying
<b  >Wrote&nbsp;.../businessletter.latex</b> to inform
you that your document has just been saved. If you accidentally
press the wrong keys and Emacs starts complaining and beeping at
you, pressing <b  >CTRL-G</b> will almost always get you
out of trouble.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c6d580.0x1d65c90"></a>Basic LaTeX Commands</h2></div></div><p>As you can see, the example letter is sprinkled with many
strange commands and curly brackets. Besides making a document less
readable, they tell LaTeX how to format it. Unfortunately, you will
need to learn at least a few of them. While you read the following
paragraphs, refer to Listing 1 to see how each command is used in
practice.</p><p>First comes the obligatory
<b  >\documentclass[...]{...}</b> command, which is not
as scary as it looks and is just an obscure way of telling LaTeX
what kind of document you are trying to print. It could be one of
the following: <b  >article</b>, <b  >book</b>,
<b  >letter</b>, <b  >report</b> and
<b  >slides</b>. Whatever you choose, put the appropriate
word between curly braces.</p><p>The square brackets surround more specific options used to
set the size of paper (available sizes include
<b  >a4paper</b>, <b  >a5paper</b>,
<b  >b5paper</b>, <b  >letterpaper</b>,
<b  >legalpaper</b> and
<b  >executivepaper</b>).</p><p>Additional information that can go there includes page
orientation (<b  >landscape</b>, useful for printing
presentation slides, or <b  >portrait</b>), main font
size (e.g., <b  >10pt</b>, <b  >12pt</b>, etc.)
and many others.</p><p>The <b  >\frenchspacing</b> command solves some of
the typesetting problems related to setting the amount of space
between a full stop and the next word after abbreviations like
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Ms.</em></span> or at the end of a sentence. I suggest you
always put it somewhere at the beginning of a file, perhaps just
after the <b  >\documentclass[...]{...}</b> command.
Purists will surely complain about this advice, but using
<b  >\frenchspacing</b> will automatically make documents
look better without causing you to worry how it happened. However,
if you want to be &ldquo;politically correct&rdquo;, always put a
<b  >~</b> between an abbreviated word ending with a full
stop and the next letter, number or word, e.g.,
<b  >Ms.~Green</b> instead of just typing <b  >Ms.
Green</b>.</p><p>After setting those options, you will need to specify the
sender's address with the <b  >\address{...}</b> command;
every line should be separated by <b  >\\</b>--this
method is used in many other commands as well. If you are using
official company letterhead, you may leave this out.</p><p>LaTeX automatically puts the current date into a letter, but
you can use the <b  >\date{...}</b> command to specify a
different one.</p><p>The signature text should go into the
<b  >\signature{...}</b> command.</p><p>To let the program know where your letter begins, use the
<b  >\begin{document}</b> and
<b  >\begin{letter}</b> commands. Just after the latter,
insert the recipient's address in curly brackets. Then, begin the
greeting with the <b  >\opening{...}</b> command and
start writing your letter. Write as much or as little as you need,
separating each paragraph with a blank line (you will need to press
the <b  >ENTER</b> key twice).</p><p>At the end of your letter, use the
<b  >\closing{...}</b> command and, if needed, add the
<b  >\cc{...}</b> for &ldquo;copies to:&rdquo;,
<b  >\encl{...}</b> for &ldquo;enclosed items:&rdquo; and
<b  >\ps{...}</b> for PostScript.</p><p>You should end a letter file with the following commands:
<b  >\end{letter}</b> and
<b  >\end{document}</b>. That's it. You can save it as
described above.</p><p>There is one trick which you can use to save yourself a bit
of work when you need to type several letters. It is possible to
begin another letter in the same file, just put the
<b  >\begin{letter}{...}</b> and the other commands
mentioned above between the <b  >\end{letter}</b> and the
<b  >\end{document}</b> commands. LaTeX will
automatically use the signature, date and sender's address you
specified at the beginning of a file (that's why you had to put
your signature text at the top of the file).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c6d580.0x1d5d7b0"></a>Changing Text into Type</h2></div></div><p>To start LaTeX, type this at the prompt:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
latex businessletter.latex
</pre><p>After you press the <b  >ENTER</b> key, LaTeX will
print some cryptic messages, two of which are most important:
<b  >Output written on businessletter.dvi...</b> and
<b  >Transcript written on businessletter.log.</b> Your
letter is output into a DVI (device independent) file, a universal
format, which you can turn into fax, PostScript or printer files.
</p><p>If there are problems, LaTeX will sometimes stop in the
middle of its work and ask you for help. When that happens, make a
note of the line number at which the error has been found, then
keep tapping the <b  >ENTER</b> key until you see the
&ldquo;Transcript written on&rdquo; message or the command prompt. Then run
<span   class="bold"><b>xdvi</b></span>, and after visually finding
the place where the error occurred, go back to Emacs and correct
your mistake. Usually it will be a missing bracket or a misspelled
command.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c6d580.0x1d5db78"></a>Previewing Documents</h2></div></div><p>The best way to find errors and check the document's look
before you print it is to use the xdvi previewer. It works only in
the X Window System. To start it, you either choose it from a menu
or type <b  >xdvi&nbsp;businessletter.dvi&nbsp;&amp;</b>
on a command line in a terminal window and press the
<b  >ENTER</b> key.</p><p>Using xdvi is easy. The buttons on the right-hand side of a
window are fairly self-explanatory, and you can press the
<b  >PAGEUP</b>/<b  >PAGEDOWN</b> keys to flip
pages back and forth or use the arrow-up/arrow-down keys to scroll
the page you are looking at up and down (the scroll bars work just
like in MS Windows, although with a two-button mouse, you will have
to press both buttons to use them). Pressing the
<b  >Q</b> key exits xdvi.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c6d580.0x1d5de90"></a>Some Unbreakable Rules</h2></div></div><p>The most common errors that can be found just by looking at a
page in xdvi are the <span   class="emphasis"><em>overfull boxes</em></span> and sudden
changes in font and style. These errors usually happen when you
forget to obey some of the following rules of typesetting in
LaTeX:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Each paragraph must by separated from another by a
blank line (just tap the <b  >ENTER</b> key twice at the
end of a paragraph).</p></li><li><p>No matter how many spaces you put between words,
LaTeX will treat them as one space and will format it according to
its own typesetting rules. (You might change this behaviour, as
described in the section &ldquo;Overriding LaTeX Rules&rdquo; below.)</p></li><li><p>Quotation marks are made using <b  >`</b>
and <b  >'</b> or <b  >&ldquo;</b> and
<b  >&rdquo;</b> instead of <b  >"</b>, so to
typeset <b  >''funny''</b>, you'll need to type
<b  >''Funny''</b> instead of
<b  >"funny"</b>.</p></li><li><p>Ellipsis (...) is printed with the
<b  >\ldots</b> command; consequently, to typeset
<span   class="emphasis"><em>bye...</em></span>, you ought to type
<b  >bye\ldots</b> and not
<b  >bye...</b>.</p></li><li><p>LaTeX commands should be separated from the actual
text. We achieve that in one of the following ways:</p></li></ul></div><p>that begins above]
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>bye, bye\ldots my love (note: the
<b  >\</b> character starts a command and therefore does
not need to be separated with a space, also see the list of special
characters below).</p></li><li><p>bye, bye\ldots{ }my love.</p></li><li><p>LaTeX interprets some characters as special, and to
print them literally, we need to use a special command instead. See
list in &ldquo;Special LaTeX Characters&rdquo;.</p></li></ul></div>

<a href="3387s1.html" target="_self">Special LaTeX Characters</a>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Commands can be nested, i.e., you can put one or
more commands within curly brackets of another, e.g.,
<b  >extsf{life&nbsp;is&nbsp;\emph{wonderful}!}</b>.</p></li></ul></div>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c6d580.0x1d5ed00"></a>Getting Rid of Overfull Boxes</h2></div></div><p>LaTeX is very good at documenting its work and puts a lot of
information, including error messages, into a log file. For
businessletter.latex, it will be called businessletter.log. Every
error is described there as best as LaTeX can, together with a line
number, which helps to quickly find the right place in a
file.</p><p>Although the visual method of finding errors with the help of
xdvi is probably best for a beginner, there is one category of bugs
that requires a different approach&mdash;the famous <span   class="emphasis"><em>Overfull
box</em></span>. LaTeX produces that message when it cannot properly
break a line of text or hyphenate a word, which happens quite often
when trying to print a long web page address.</p><p>The quickest way of finding those messages is by using
<span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
grep Overfull businessletter.log | less
</pre><p>After issuing the above command in an Xterm window, you will
see either an empty window (a good thing) or a list of lines where
LaTeX has put the ominous word. Go back to Emacs, find the
offending lines, then use xdvi to judge how to best fix your
document.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c6d580.0x1d5f018"></a>Overriding LaTeX Rules</h2></div></div><p>LaTeX is very good at typesetting, but it still needs our
help from time to time, especially in the case of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Overfull box</em></span> error. Helping LaTeX usually
means manually breaking a particular line of text. Don't worry, it
will not hurt; just follow the rules given below:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>To correct bad hyphenation, put
<b  >\-</b> inside a word, at a place where you think it
should be hyphenated, e.g., <b  >lab\-yrinth</b> or
<b  >laby\-rinth</b>.</p></li><li><p>To break a line after or before a word, without
inserting a hyphen, use the <b  >\linebreak[4]</b>
command. (Try it on a line from the earlier example to see how it
works for yourself.) The text before the command will be set to
fill the whole width of the paragraph.</p></li><li><p>To break a line without filling the width of a
paragraph, use <b  >\\</b>.</p></li><li><p>To end a page and start a new one, use
<b  >\pagebreak[4]</b> or
<b  >\newpage</b>.</p></li><li><p>To keep a part of text together (such as a phone
number), use the <b  >\mbox{...}</b> command; e.g.,
<b  >\mbox{+0 (11) 123 456 789}</b> will be moved to a
new line if it does not fit on the current one, but it will not be
broken in half.</p></li></ul></div><p>After you insert one of these commands into the text, save
it, run LaTeX, see how it looks in xdvi and use grep to find out
whether any problems remain. Repeat until you get rid of all
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Overfull boxes</em></span>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c6d580.0x2072ea8"></a>Some Useful Formatting Tips</h2></div></div><p>So far, you have read about formatting letters, but you can
typeset all sorts of documents with LaTeX. For example, using
<b  >\documentclass[...]{report}</b> will put LaTeX into
a nice report formatting mode. Brochures can be typeset with
<b  >\documentclass[...]{book}</b>; memos with a
<b  >\documentclass[...]{article}</b> and presentation
slides with <b  >\documentclass[...]{slides}</b>.</p><p>To make those documents look truly professional, there are a
few additional commands like <b  >\author{...}</b>,
<b  >itle{...}</b>, and if necessary,
<b  >\date{...}</b>. To generate a title header or a
title page, use <b  >\maketitle</b> after the last one.
You should place those commands before
<b  >\begin{document}</b>.</p><p>In all cases of documents other than a letter, we do not need
the <b  >\address{...}</b>,
<b  >\signature{...}</b>,
<b  >\begin{letter}</b>,
<b  >\opening{...}</b>, <b  >\closing{...}</b>,
<b  >\cc{...}</b>, <b  >\encl{...}</b>,
<b  >\ps{...}</b> or <b  >\end{letter}</b>
commands.</p><p>To divide long text into parts, sections and chapters, use
the <b  >\part{...}</b>, <b  >\section{...}</b>
and <b  >\chapter{...}</b> commands.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c6d580.0x20737f0"></a>Lists</h2></div></div><p><a href="3387l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>There are two kinds of lists you can typeset with LaTeX:
bulleted (see Listing 2) and numbered (see Listing 3). Numbered
lists are especially handy for all sorts of agreements, contracts,
instructions, etc.</p><p><a href="3387l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c6d580.0x2073a58"></a>Fonts and Styles</h2></div></div><p>Here is a list of additional useful commands for formatting
text:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>italics</em></span>: enclose the text you
want printed in italics with the <b  >\emph{...}</b>
command, e.g., <b  >I wish to \emph{emphasize}
this!</b></p></li><li><p>alignment of text&mdash;left:right:center:
<b  >\begin{center}...\end{center}</b>;</p></li><li><p><b  >typewriter text</b>:

following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chmod 444 businessletter.latex
</pre><p>These permissions will ensure that no one (including you) can
overwrite the file you created. Anyone can open it, but to save the
changes, it must be given a different name. In Emacs, you can do
that with <b  >CTRL-X</b> and <b  >W</b>. It is
also a good idea to place all templates in a separate directory.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c6d580.0x2074768"></a>Printing</h2></div></div><p>Before you send files generated by LaTeX to a printer or a
fax modem, they need to be converted to the right format.
Fortunately, all distributions of Linux come with a set of
conversion utilities that can handle this job without too much
human intervention&mdash;you just give them the name of a file and they
do the rest:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>dvi2fax</b></span>: turns DVI
files into fax format, making it possible to send them via a fax
modem.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>dvilj</b></span>: turns DVI
files into Hewlett-Packard LaserJet format. Even if your printer is
not made by HP, it can probably still understand or
<span   class="emphasis"><em>emulate</em></span> LaserJet commands. All you have to do
is switch it into HP <i  >LJ</i> emulation mode, which should be described
in the printer's manual. Some printers can switch into that mode
automatically.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>dvilj2p</b></span>: the DVI
to Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 2p format converter (similar to
dvilj).</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>dvilj4</b></span>: the DVI to
Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 4 format converter (similar to
dvilj).</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>dvips</b></span>: turns DVI
files into PostScript format, allowing them to be printed on an
Adobe PostScript compatible printer.</p></li></ul></div><p>If you want to print the example letter, type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
dvilj businessletter.dvi
</pre>


and then:
<pre     class="programlisting">
lpr businessletter.lj
</pre>


If nothing happens (you did remember to switch the printer on,
didn't you?), type <b  >lpq</b> and see if the name of
your document is on a list there; if you get a &ldquo;no entries&rdquo;
message, then your machine is probably not set up properly for
printing. In that case, ask the system administrator or the service
person for help. Sometimes the printer receives the document, but
waits after receiving each page for you to press the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Print</em></span> or <span   class="emphasis"><em>On-line</em></span> button.
This depends on the printer, but a good rule of thumb is if the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Data</em></span> light is on or blinking and the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Print</em></span> or <span   class="emphasis"><em>On-Line</em></span> lights
are off or blinking, then pressing one of them will solve the
problem.
</p><p>Also, on some printers you will need to feed an additional
page at the end&mdash;it will come out blank, and you can reuse
it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c6d580.0x22efc20"></a>Converting Files between Microsoft Word and
LaTeX</h2></div></div><p>So far, converting Microsoft Word files to LaTeX is a bit
difficult. There are several strategies, but none of them will make
you perfectly happy. To convert a Word file to LaTeX, you
can:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Save the MS Word file as a TEXT or an ASCII file.
You will lose all formatting, pictures, drawings, linked and
embedded documents, but you will at least get the text in a format
that can be read by Emacs and LaTeX.</p></li><li><p>Save the MS Word file as an RTF file and use either
<span   class="bold"><b>catdoc</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>word2x</b></span> command to turn a DOC file
into a LaTeX file. (Type <b  >man&nbsp;catdoc</b> or
<b  >man&nbsp;word2x</b> to learn more about their use
and options. If <span   class="bold"><b>man</b></span> does not work,
try <span   class="bold"><b>info</b></span>.) You will lose some of
the formatting information, but most of it will be preserved,
making your job a little easier.</p></li></ul></div><p>If you need to convert a LaTeX document into a DOC file, try
the following method:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Use <span   class="bold"><b>delatex</b></span> (or
<span   class="bold"><b>detex</b></span>) to convert a LaTeX file
into a plain text (ASCII) file:</p></li></ul></div>

<pre     class="programlisting">
        delatex businessletter.latex &gt;\
        businessletter.txt
</pre>


<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Compare the output with the original file, and if
necessary, remove some of the commands and add missing text. These
converters do not yet work as we need them to,
unfortunately.</p></li><li><p>Open the TXT file in Word; you will then be asked
if you want to convert it from a text format. Click
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Yes</em></span>, apply formatting as it is needed and

So far, these are the most common ways of exchanging files between
MS Word and LaTeX, or any other word processor like Corel
WordPerfect or Lotus AmiPro/WordPro, even if some of them are
available for Linux. There are some interesting developments on the
horizon, but none of them can be recommended for use in a typical
office yet.
</p><p>That is just about everything you will need to start using
LaTeX in an office. Of course, there is more to learn and I
recommend you use the <b  >locate&nbsp;'lshort2e.dvi'</b>
command to see if you can find the &ldquo;Not So Short Introduction to
LaTeX2e&rdquo;. It is a well-written LaTeX manual filled with many
interesting examples.</p><p>All examples from this article can be found on the Internet

available on your system, ask the administrator to install them and
give you the necessary permissions to use them. All of those tools
should be available for any Linux distribution.</p></div></div>
