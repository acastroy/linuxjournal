Hours</em></span> is a well-written book that claims to teach you,
in 24 one-hour lessons of a chapter each, how to use StarOffice, a
complete office suite from StarDivision.</p><p>The book is split into five parts. You will probably use
StarOffice mostly for word processing, spreadsheets and
presentations, so the sections are appropriately organized. Part
One, &ldquo;Preparing to Use StarOffice&rdquo;, goes over the basics of
installing StarOffice, getting started with the program, using the
built-in StarOffice Explorer and Desktop, configuring StarOffice,
importing and exporting documents, and creating graphics with
StarDraw. The last chapter of part one, on StarDraw, seems a little
out of place in this section and would probably have worked better
in Part Four, &ldquo;Working with Presentations&rdquo;. Except for that,
however, these six chapters give a thorough enough introduction to
StarOffice, one that will definitely help you on your way.</p><p>StarWriter, the StarOffice word processor, is covered in Part
Two, &ldquo;Creating Documents with StarWriter&rdquo;. Topics in this section
include creating new documents, formatting (fonts, margins, etc.),
advanced formatting tools (footnotes, columns and text styles),
tables and indexes, inserting graphics and the spell
checker/thesaurus. The areas covered are good choices, going over a
wide area of StarWriter's capabilities. This means, of course, that
most topics aren't delved into very deeply, but that's to be
expected when each chapter is designed to take up only an hour. For
one-hour lessons, some of the chapters cover quite a
bit&mdash;definitely enough to get you started.</p><p>Part Three goes over StarCalc, the StarOffice spreadsheet
program. This section could very easily serve as an introduction to
other spreadsheet programs as well (with the slight differences
inherent in each program added). Six chapters are devoted to
StarCalc: creating spreadsheets, entering spreadsheet data, using
formulas and functions, formatting, adding charts and graphics, and
using StarCalc's database functions. Again, these areas are
well-chosen, covering both the basics and some of the
not-so-basics.</p><p>StarImpress, the StarOffice presentations program, is given
three chapters in Part Four. You learn how to create presentations,
add graphics and charts to those presentations, and then pretty
them up for general consumption. Given that presentations probably
aren't used as much as word processing and spreadsheets, the
smaller amount of space devoted to StarImpress is acceptable. It
serves well as a short introduction to StarImpress, helping you get
started. Noticing a trend here? This book isn't an in-depth
discussion of StarOffice&mdash;rather, its main purpose is to give you a
quick overview, brief enough to be digested in a day.</p><p>Part five, &ldquo;Using Internet and Scheduling Features in
StarOffice&rdquo;, also devotes three chapters to these functions. There
is a chapter on creating web pages, one devoted to e-mail and
newsgroup features, and finally a chapter on StarSchedule, the
StarOffice scheduler. These also introduce their topics, giving you
just enough information to have an idea of what you're
doing.</p><p>Does the book succeed in its title claim? Yes, it does. If
you want a quick introduction to the many different facets of
StarOffice, one you can get through in just a number of hours, buy
this book.</p></div></div>
