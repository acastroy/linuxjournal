    Mark talks about his crazy multi-boot computer, which does
    have some practical value.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee4580.0x1fdc500"></a></h2></div></div><p>After I started going to computer
conferences, I realized I needed to be able to demonstrate Linux
working with other operating systems as well as different
distributions of Linux. Having one computer for each operating
system seemed a bit much, so it became important to have a
multi-boot computer to reduce the number of computers I would need.
The goal was to put several distributions of Linux, along with
other operating systems, onto the computer and be able to choose
which operating system I wanted when I turned on the computer. The
other operating systems were Windows 98, Windows NT, DOS and
FreeBSD.
</p><p>The computer was originally configured on an IDE system as
follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Primary Partition 1: Windows 98 (2GB)</p></li><li><p>Primary Partition 2: 100MB of Linux swap
space</p></li><li><p>Primary Partition 3: Red Hat Linux 5.2 (&gt;
1GB)</p></li><li><p>Extended Partition 4</p></li><li><p>Logical Partition 5: Windows NT 4.0 (2GB)</p></li></ul></div><p>The goal was to install more distributions of Linux and
FreeBSD onto this computer. The problem was, all the disk space was
used up. It was going to be hard to add more systems. A crazy
solution had to be used, and this was where the beauty of Linux
shone forth.
</p><p>When the kernel for Linux starts, it doesn't have to reside
on the same partition it will use for the &ldquo;root&rdquo; partition. The
root partition for Linux is just like the root partition for UNIX
systems: it contains all files and directories for the operating
system to use after the kernel gets started. That is, the kernel
can reside on a different partition than the one used for its files
and directories after it starts.</p><p>So, put every non-Linux operating system on the first hard
drive, as well as one small Linux installation. Then, install all
other distributions of Linux onto a second hard drive. The small
Linux installation on the first hard drive will contain the kernels
for each of the Linux installations (including its own) that reside
on the second hard drive. In addition, the small installation on
the first hard drive will configure LILO, so that you can choose
which version of Linux you want (off of the second hard drive) when
the computer starts. The trick is, LILO will be configured to grab
a kernel from the small installation on the first hard drive, then
switch to the second hard drive and use the appropriate partition
for that kernel.</p><p>In order to install FreeBSD and a small Linux installation on
the first hard drive, both the original swap and Linux partition on
the first hard drive must be deleted. In place of the swap
partition, install a 100MB installation of Red Hat. In place of the
original Linux partition, install FreeBSD. Now the configuration
should look like this:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Primary Partition 1: Windows 98</p></li><li><p>Primary Partition 2: Red Hat Linux 5.2 (using only
100MB of space)</p></li><li><p>Primary Partition 3: FreeBSD</p></li><li><p>Extended Partition 4</p></li><li><p>Logical Partition 5: Windows NT 4.0</p></li></ul></div><p>Listing 1 is the configuration of LILO in /etc/lilo.conf
within the Linux partition.
</p><p><a href="3559l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>Now, two steps are needed to install the rest of the Linux
distributions on the second hard drive. First, all Linux
distributions need to be installed without modifying how the
computer boots up. The partition table on the second hard drive is
set up as shown below. My second hard drive was an IDE hard drive
set to be the master on the secondary IDE channel (which becomes
&ldquo;/dev/hdc&rdquo; in Linux).</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Primary Partition 1: spare Linux partition
(unused)</p></li><li><p>Primary Partition 2: Red Hat 6.0 Linux</p></li><li><p>Primary Partition 3: Debian Linux</p></li><li><p>Extended Partition 4</p></li><li><p>Logical Partition 5: Linux swap (usable by all
Linux distributions)</p></li><li><p>Logical Partition 6: Slackware Linux</p></li><li><p>Logical Partition 7: Caldera OpenLinux</p></li><li><p>Logical Partition 8: SuSE Linux</p></li><li><p>Logical Partition 9: Mandrake Linux</p></li><li><p>Logical Partition 10: shared partition among all
Linux distributions located at /Shared.</p></li></ul></div><p>After each of these Linux distributions is installed on the
second hard drive, the hardest part is setting it up so that any of
these operating systems or Linux distributions can be chosen at
boot time. Next, do the following:
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Turn on the computer and choose the small
installation of Linux by typing in <b  >linux</b> when
the LILO prompt appears.</p></li><li><p>Copy each kernel or /boot directory from each Linux
installation to a directory under /lilo.</p></li><li><p>Edit the /etc/lilo.conf file. Add each kernel for
each Linux distribution to the file, including the option to change
to the appropriate partition for the root directory after the
kernel starts.</p></li><li><p>Execute the command
<span   class="bold"><b>lilo</b></span>.</p></li></ol></div>

An example lilo.conf file is shown in Listing 2.
</p><p><a href="3559l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>Because LILO was installed, when the computer reboots the
LILO prompt will come up. From here, pressing the
<b  >TAB</b> key gives a list of the various options from
which to choose. Typing in one of the following will start the
corresponding operating system: &ldquo;linux&rdquo;, &ldquo;linuxkernels&rdquo;,
&ldquo;MicroSoft&rdquo;, &ldquo;FreeBSD&rdquo;, &ldquo;Debian&rdquo;, &ldquo;Slackware&rdquo;, &ldquo;Caldera&rdquo;,
&ldquo;SUSE&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mandrake&rdquo;. Choosing nothing would mean that the
first option &ldquo;linux&rdquo; would be chosen. Also, if &ldquo;MicroSoft&rdquo; is
chosen, another menu will pop up which will let you choose
&ldquo;Windows98&rdquo; or &ldquo;WindowsNT&rdquo;. This other menu is the NT Boot
Loader.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee4580.0x1fd45f8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>There are different ways to set up a multi-boot system using
Linux and other operating systems. If you do it right, you can use
one kernel for all the Linux distributions. In the method shown,
the swap partition is shared by all Linux distributions.</p><p>If I had started from scratch, I would have used one 20GB IDE
hard drive. As a suggestion, if you have to duplicate the
configuration above, I would install Windows 98 first, then Windows
NT, then FreeBSD, then the Linux distributions.</p><p>Personally, I think it is very cool and exciting how there
are so many options associated with LILO. In my opinion, both LILO
and the kernel are very well-designed. LILO makes it easy to do the
weird stuff like I did above. Thanks to all the guys who developed
LILO and the Linux kernel, and to Paul Hostetler and Phil Hunter
for their help.</p><p><a href="3559s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
