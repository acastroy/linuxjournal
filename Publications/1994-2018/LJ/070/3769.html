    Writing Emacs macros doesn't have to be hard&mdash;Mr. Pedersen
    helps you get &ldquo;more power&rdquo;.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xde3580.0xedb500"></a></h2></div></div><p>People sometimes tend to forget that
computers are tools that can make their lives much easier. One of
the things computers are especially good at, and which is easy to
teach them is monotonous, repetitive work. It gets even better.
This kind of work also seems to be the work humans are worst at
doing; that is, monotonous, repetitive work tends to be very
error-prone. Emacs can eliminate repetitive work with a very useful
concept called macros. Macros are basically keystrokes that Emacs
types for you.
</p><p>This article will describe Emacs macros and show you a number
of useful examples. Furthermore, it will discuss an Emacs package I
have written called power-macros, which makes it very easy to bind
macros to keys and save them to a file for use in later Emacs
sessions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xde3580.0xedb660"></a>Defining an Emacs Macro</h2></div></div><p>Defining an Emacs macro is done by pressing <b  >CTRL-x&nbsp;(</b>.
That is, press <b  >CTRL</b>, hold it down
and press x, release both, then press the open parenthesis. The
subsequent keystrokes will be part of your macro; that is, when you
ask Emacs to execute your macro, these keystrokes will be typed for you.
When you are done defining the macro, press <b  >CTRL-x&nbsp;)</b>.</p><p>When a macro has been defined, you can ask Emacs to imitate
your keystrokes as often as you want simply by pressing
<b  >CTRL-x&nbsp;e</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xde3580.0xedb920"></a>Two Cent Tip</h2></div></div><p>If you need to repeat a macro several times, it might be
quite annoying to have to press two keys to execute it. A solution
to this is to bind a command to &ldquo;execute-last-defined-keyboard
macro&rdquo; to a single key press. For example, you could bind this
command to <b  >SHIFT-F1</b> by inserting the following
code into your .emacs file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(global-set-key [(shift f1)] 'call-last-kbd-macro)
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xde3580.0xedbad8"></a>Example: Making the Current Word Bold</h2></div></div><p>Those are the macro basics. I'm fairly sure you don't yet
have the feeling this would change your world much, right?
Therefore, here is a small example to whet your appetite. More will
follow later.</p><p>Imagine that you often want to make the current word in
boldface. In HTML documents, you could do that simply by inserting
&lt;b&gt; and &lt;/b&gt; around the word. That's no big job, but if
you are copy-editing a book and need to make words in boldface
hundreds of times each hour, a macro to do this can save you a lot
of time.</p><p>The macro is easily recorded: press
<b  >CTRL-x&nbsp;(</b>, go to the beginning of the word,
type &lt;b&gt;, go to the end of the word, type &lt;/b&gt;,
<b  >CTRL-x&nbsp;)</b>, then press
<b  >CTRL-x&nbsp;e</b> at the beginning of each word you
wish to bold in the document.</p><p>There is one very important point to notice about this: you
are not allowed to go to the beginning or end of the word by
pressing the arrow key a number of times! Why not? Well, if you do,
the macro will fail to find the border of the word if your word is
of a different length than the word used when defining the macro.
You must instead use the commands forward-word and backward-word.
These commands are bound to <b  >CTRL</b> and the arrow
keys. Thus, to go to the end of a word, simply press
<b  >CTRL</b> and the right-arrow key.</p><p>Basically, there are two kinds of macros: those used
infrequently, and those used many times in a row and then never
used again. The &ldquo;make word bold&rdquo; example is a macro of the first
kind. The description of the second kind is outside the scope of
this article, but one example could be a macro that added
<b  >/* REMOVE</b>: to the beginning of a line, and
<b  >*/</b> to the end of a line. You may use such a
macro a number of times in a row to comment out a whole function in
C for later removal.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xde3580.0xedbfa8"></a>Making Macros More General</h2></div></div><p>In some C++ programs, you will often find constructs which
resemble the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
for (bool
...
}
</pre><p>The only difference from one occasion to the next is the set
of names: <span   class="emphasis"><em>cont</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>iterator</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>value</em></span> and the content in between the curly
brackets.
</p><p>If you insert the above code often, you may wish to build a
macro to help you with this. Your first attempt may be to define a
macro, which simply inserts:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
for (bool =.First(); ; =.Next()) {
}
</pre><p>That is, a macro that simply leaves out all the parts that
may change from time to time. This is, however, not as useful as it
could be, simply because you would need to type
<span   class="emphasis"><em>cont</em></span> three times and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>iterator</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>value</em></span> two
times each. What you really would like is to have Emacs ask you
which names to use. You can do that with macros. The trick is
called &ldquo;recursive editing&rdquo;. With recursive editing, you can tell
Emacs to stop at a specific place in the macro, do some editing,
and when done, tell Emacs to continue with the macro.
</p><p>When you record macros, you tell Emacs to enter recursive
editing by pressing
<b  >CRTL-u</b> <b  >CTRL-x&nbsp;q</b>.
Then whenever you execute the macro, Emacs will stop macro
execution at that point to let you do some editing, and then the
macro will continue when you press <b  >CTRL-META-c</b>.
(If there is no <b  >META</b> key on your keyboard, it is
most likely the <b  >ALT</b> key instead.)</p><p>While you record the macro, Emacs will also enter recursive
editing at that point. That is, the editing you do from the point
you press <b  >CTRL-u&nbsp;CTRL-x&nbsp;q</b> until you
press <b  >CTRL-META-c</b> will not be part of the
macro.</p><p>We are almost ready to develop a neat and useful macro, but
first let's exercise what we've learned so far with a simple
example. Type the following:
<b  >CTRL-x&nbsp;(</b> Type a word ==&gt; <b  >CTRL-u&nbsp;CTRL-x&nbsp;q</b>.
</p><p>Now type Hello World, and when done, continue typing the
following:
<b  >CTRL-META-CTRL</b> &lt;== <b  >CTRL-x&nbsp;)</b>
</p><p>
The above inserted the following text into your buffer:
<pre     class="screen">
Type a word ==&gt;Hello World&lt;==
</pre>

Furthermore, it also defined a macro, which inserts this text
except for the words &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;. Whenever you execute the
just-defined macro, Emacs will pause after having inserted
<b  >Type a word ==&gt;</b>, and when you press
<b  >CTRL-META-c</b>, it will continue with the macro,
which means it will insert the text <b  >&lt;==</b>.
</p><p>Can you see where we are heading? Now we have the tools to
ask the user for the three names needed, so now all we need is a
way to fetch the information he typed and insert it at the
appropriate places.</p><p>Fetching the information could be done several ways. The
simplest (that is, the one which requires the least knowledge of
Emacs) would simply be to switch to a temporary buffer, let the
user type in the information there, and whenever one of the words
is needed, simply go to this buffer and fetch it there.</p><p>A much smarter way is to use registers. A register is a
container where you may save the text of the current region for
later use. To insert text into a register, mark a region and press
<b  >CTRL-x&nbsp;r&nbsp;s</b> and a letter (the letter
indicates the register in which to save the information). Later,
you may insert the contents of the register into the buffer by
pressing <b  >CTRL-x&nbsp;r&nbsp;i</b> and pressing the
letter you typed above.</p><p><a href="3769l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>Listing 1 shows all the keystrokes needed to record this
macro. Text in between quotes should be typed literally, and text
in italics is comments, which should not be typed. It may seem like
a lot of typing to obtain this, but on the other hand, when you are
done, you will have a very user-friendly interface to inserting the
given for-loops.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xde3580.0xed36a8"></a>Power-Macros</h2></div></div><p>Power Macros is an Emacs package, which I developed out of
frustration at not being able to define a macro, bind it to a key,
and have it bound for future Emacs sessions (or rather, not being
able to do so easily).</p><p>To use this Emacs package, download the file from its home
page at
<a href="http://www.imada.sdu.dk/~blackie/emacs" target="_self">http://www.imada.sdu.dk/~blackie/emacs/</a>.
Copy the Lisp file to a location in your load path, and insert the
following into your .emacs file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(require 'power-macros)
(power-macros-mode)
(pm-load)
</pre><p>If you do not know what a load path is, or do not have one,
create a directory called Emacs in your home directory, copy the
file to this directory, and insert the following line into your
.emacs file before the lines above:
<pre     class="programlisting">
(setq load-path (cons "~/Emacs" load-path))
</pre>


When that is done, you may simply press
<b  >CTRL-c&nbsp;n</b> when you have defined a macro, and
Emacs will ask you the following questions in the mini-buffer.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Which key to bind the macro
to?</b></span> First, Emacs must know to which key the macro should
be bound. When you are finished answering these questions, the
macro will be available simply by pressing this key. By binding to
different keys, you can have several macros defined at the same
time.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>How should the macro be
accessible?</b></span> With power-macros, you may make the macro
accessible in one of two ways:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Global: it is accessible in every buffer.</p></li><li><p>A major-mode-specific macro: the macro is
accessible only in buffers with a given major mode.</p></li></ol></div><p>As an example of a mode-specific macro, think about the
for-loop macro from the example above. This macro is useful only
when writing C++ programs. Furthermore, you may need a similar
macro using Java syntax for programming Java. With power-macros,
you may bind both the macro for C++-mode and the macro for
Java-mode to the same key (say <b  >CTRL-m-f</b>); then
the correct one will be used for the given mode.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Which file should it be saved
to?</b></span> By default, Emacs saves the macros defined with
power-macro to the file named ~/.power-macros. If that is okay for
the macro you are defining, simply press <b  >ENTER</b>
at this question. If you do not want to save the given macro to a
file for future Emacs sessions, remove the suggested text (i.e.,
answer the question with an empty string). Also, you can name
another file. The section below has a description of when doing
this can be of special interest.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>What is its description?</b></span>
Finally, you have to write a description for the macro just
defined. This will make it much easier for you to identify it
later, when you have forgotten which key it is bound to, or when
you are searching for a key to bind a new macro.</p><p>As part of binding the macro to a key, Emacs will also check
if the given binding will override an existing binding. If this is
the case, it will warn you and ask for confirmation to continue the
definition.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xde3580.0xed3f98"></a>Local Macros</h2></div></div><p>Some time ago, I was going to give a speech on Emacs. I have
previously made that a number of times, so I hadn't done any
special preparation for this specific speech. While I was traveling
to the event by train, I decided to go through my presentation. I
was terrified to see that the presentation program suddenly didn't
work on my machine. What should I do? The answer was obvious: why
not make the presentation using Emacs? Fortunately, the input to
the other presentation program was ASCII, and the only construct I
used in the presentation was enumerated lists, so it was very easy
to rewrite the presentation so it looked good in an Emacs buffer
(with a slightly enlarged font).</p><p>Now there was only one problem: how could I easily go
forward/backward one presentation page? The answer was to create
two macros: one going forward one page, and another going backward
one page.</p><p>Going forward one page was done in the following way:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Search for a line starting with a number of equal
signs, namely the second line of each presentation page (just below
the title of the page).</p></li><li><p>Press
<b  >CTRL-1</b>&nbsp;<b  >CTRL-l</b> (that is,
control-(number)one control-(letter)l). This would locate this line
as the second line of the screen, and consequently, the title of
the page would be the first one.</p></li><li><p>Go to the beginning of the next line. This was
necessary so that the subsequent search would not find the current
page.</p></li></ul></div><p>The two macros just defined are useful only for the given
file, and later for all files which contain a presentation made for
viewing with Emacs. Therefore, it would be a bit annoying to have
these macros defined and bound to keys all the time, especially
given that there might be several months before my next Emacs
presentation.
</p><p>The two macros were therefore saved to a separate file, and
whenever needed, I can simply load them. Loading a power-macro is
done by using the function
<span   class="bold"><b>pm-load</b></span>. Thus, I could load the
macros by pressing <b  >META-x</b>, typing
<b  >pm-load</b>, pressing <b  >ENTER</b>, and
typing the name of the file to load. Loading the macros for the
presentation could be done even more automatically by inserting the
following lines as the last lines of the file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Local Variables:
eval: (pm-load "presentation.macro")
End:
</pre><p>Here, it is assumed that the name of the file containing the
macros is called presentation.macro. Now, Emacs automatically loads
the presentation macros whenever the file is opened.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xde3580.0xed4728"></a>Managing Power-Macros</h2></div></div><p>When you have defined a number of macros, you might want to
perform various functions to manage your macros. This is done by
pressing <b  >CTRL-c&nbsp;m</b>. It will bring up a
buffer like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
the one shown in Figure 1.
</pre><p>What you see in this buffer is your power-macros, each
separated with a line of dashes. Many keys have special meanings in
this buffer (just like the keys have special meanings in the
buffer-managing buffer or in the dired buffer).
</p><p>Pressing the <b  >ENTER</b> key on top of one of
the fields allows you to edit the given field. Editing a field
means either to change its content or copy the macro to a new one
with the given field changed. You specify whichever of these
meanings you intend, when you have pressed <b  >ENTER</b>
on the field.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3769f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Emacs Power-Macro Buffer
</p></div></div><p>Deletion of macros is done in two steps. First, you mark the
macros you want to delete, and next you tell Emacs to actually
delete them. If you know either the buffer-managing buffer or
dired-mode, you will be familiar with this two-step process.</p><p>If you are now ready to learn more about Emacs, visit my home
