    The GNOME team bring us up-to-date on the progress of this
    popular desktop environment.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15f7a28"></a></h2></div></div><p>The GNOME Project is aimed at making UNIX
attractive and easy to use. To help achieve the goals of the GNU
project, we want to make sure that users are presented with a full
suite of applications, as well as a desktop that enables them to
manage their computers effectively. The GNOME team has been
focusing on creating a reusable infrastructure of development
libraries and tools, along with productivity applications based on
this infrastructure.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15f7b30"></a>GNOME Overview</h2></div></div><p>The goals of the GNOME Project can be divided into three
areas:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>a full-featured desktop environment</p></li><li><p>a set of interoperable applications with a
consistent, easy-to-use interface</p></li><li><p>a powerful application development framework</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15f7ea0"></a>The Desktop</h2></div></div><p>The desktop environment is not the set of applications, such
as a web browser or a spreadsheet, with which a user interacts with
the system to do useful tasks; rather, it is the utilities which
provide the user with control over the working environment. As the
most immediately apparent part of GNOME, the desktop environment
includes the file manager, panel and help browser, as well as other
utilities necessary for the day-to-day maintenance of one's
computing environment.</p><p>The GNOME session begins with the GNOME Display Manager which
grants access to the system. The beauty of this process is that the
author of GDM rewrote the whole login sequence to be secure and
extensible. The GDM code base is designed to be robust and
secure.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3754f1.large.jpg"><img src="3754f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. GNOME Screenshot</p></div></div>
</p><p>From there, the GNOME panel and the GNOME file manager
provide the desktop functionality to let users launch applications
and manage their information see Figure 1).</p><p>The GNOME desktop was the first desktop to include
application themes. Application themes are a way to make
applications look different. People can choose to make their
desktop look like other popular systems, or tune it to suit their
needs and personal interface desire. The next major release of
GNOME will include a new, updated and better integrated theme
mechanism, and also theme packages that will affect the entire
desktop, not just the applications.</p><p>We also integrate the GNOME personal information management
system (calendar, address book, task list) with the Palm Pilot, and
more systems can be plugged into the system. To learn more about
this feature, visit
<a href="http://www.gnome.org/gnome-pilot" target="_self">http://www.gnome.org/gnome-pilot/</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15f8370"></a>The GNOME Workshop</h2></div></div><p>Just being able to choose a screen saver, organize icons,
browse application menus and move files doesn't mean you are a
productive member of society. What users want is a set of
applications to help them accomplish actual work. This is where the
GNOME Workshop project comes in. Many applications not done by the
core GNOME team are available, but would be much more useful if
they were integrated with each other and the desktop. The GNOME
Workshop project wants to make a set of highly integrated
applications to do what you need, whether it is managing finances,
writing letters or editing a picture. Components of GNOME Workshop
that have already reached a functional state include a highly
capable spreadsheet (Gnumeric), a word-processing application
(AbiWord), and an image-editing application (the famous GIMP).
Other component applications are coming along quickly, and news of
their releases will be listed on the GNOME Workshop home
page.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3754f2.large.jpg"><img src="3754f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Gnumeric and Bonobo
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15f8630"></a>Developer Goodies</h2></div></div><p>Another important part of GNOME is the development
environment. UNIX has not had a history of applications with a
consistent and powerful graphical interface. The few graphical
applications that existed all behaved and looked a little
differently, usually did not have a powerful interface, and were
not easy for their developers to write. GNOME addresses this last
need by simplifying the development of applications, allowing the
creation of easy-to-use and powerful graphical interfaces.</p><p>GNOME provides a high-level application framework which frees
the programmer from having to worry about the low-level details of
graphical application interfaces, allowing him to concentrate on
the actual application. Glade, a tool for user-interface design
used by many GNOME applications, takes this concept a step further
by allowing graphical creation of a program's user interface. The
Libglade library allows user interfaces to be created at runtime
from the XML interface description files saved by Glade. GNOME also
recognizes that not every programming language is useful for every
kind of job. We paid special attention to making the GNOME APIs
easy to wrap and export to other programming languages, to let
people develop their GNOME-based applications in their language of
choice.</p><p>In addition to C, which the core GNOME libraries are written
in, there are bindings for many languages, including C++, Objective
C, Guile, Python, Perl, Ada95, Tom, Pascal, Haskell and others.
Java bindings are in development; when coupled with
<span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span>'s ability to compile Java
code, Java may become a viable alternative for GNOME
programming.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15f8840"></a>The GNOME Workshop components</h2></div></div><p></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15f8948"></a>The Gnumeric Spreadsheet</h2></div></div><p>The objectives of the Gnumeric spreadsheet (see Figure 2) are
to include all the features you can find on proprietary
spreadsheets. Gnumeric has implemented most of the built-in
functions available in Excel 2000, and by the time you read this,
it should be complete.</p><p>Users can write their own functions in Python, Perl or
Scheme, and access them through the Gnumeric engine. This enables
people to adapt Gnumeric to their needs. Of course, if you like to
use C, C++ or assembly, you can also hook up your functions to the
spreadsheet.</p><p>We are copying many good ideas and usability features from
popular spreadsheets and including them in Gnumeric.</p><p>Gnumeric also serves as a test-bed for the various GNOME
technologies: CORBA, the Bonobo component and document model, and
the GNOME printing architecture. Gnumeric was also one of the first
applications that used libxml (the Gnumeric native file format is
XML-based).</p><p>Gnumeric's rich set of import and export filters make it
quite a valuable addition to your tool box, and if you are looking
for an application to load your Excel spreadsheets, look no
further: Gnumeric has the best Excel importing functionality
available for GNU/Linux as tested by
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LinuxWorld</em></span>.</p><p>Not only can you define your own functions for spreadsheets
in the languages mentioned above, but you can actually script the
entire application from any language that supports CORBA. Anything
the user can do by using the spreadsheet user interface can be done
through a CORBA communications channel, enabling you to use
Gnumeric as a reusable engine for your applications.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15f8c60"></a>The AbiWord Word Processor</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3754f3.large.jpg"><img src="3754f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. AbiWord with GNOME Support
</p></div></div><p>AbiWord (see Figure 3) is a project led by Source-Gear. It is
a cross-platform word processor that can import your Word files.
The word processor has gotten attention from many communities,
since they can run the same word processor across UNIX, Win32, BeOS
and MacOS. Their web site is at
<a href="http://www.abisource.com" target="_self">http://www.abisource.com/</a>;
you can download it from there. Abi contains a number of
interesting features found in the proprietary word-processing
equivalents.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15ef808"></a>The GIMP</h2></div></div><p>The GIMP is the de facto standard for image editing, photo
retouching, image authoring and composition. It is hard to list all
the features, as it is one of the most successful free software
projects. The GIMP is among the most actively developed
applications, and Yosh Manish acts as its maintainer and
coordinator.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15ef910"></a>Dia</h2></div></div><p>Dia is a diagram application that can be used as a
replacement for the popular proprietary application &ldquo;Visio&rdquo;. Dia
supports various kinds of high-level objects for drawing: UML,
Network, databases, circuit objects, flow charts and more. Dia is
easy to extend with new object collections, as the various objects
are defined using an XML-based file format.</p><p>It has quickly become the tool of choice for GNOME developers
for generating diagrams and communicating graphical information
with other developers. The Dia team consists of seven programmers
and is commanded by Alexander Larsson. The Dia community is very
active.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15efa70"></a>GNOME DB</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3754f4.large.jpg"><img src="3754f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. GNOME DB User Interface
</p></div></div><p>GNOME DB (see Figure 4) is a framework for creating database
applications. It provides both a common API with pluggable back
ends to various database sources, and specialized widgets for
handling various database tasks. The back ends, in the typical
GNOME tradition, are based on CORBA. Michael Lausch and Rodrigo
Moya are the main developers of this project.</p><p>GNOME-DB is composed of three separate, independent layers.
The lowest level contains the database servers, which are CORBA
servers that map the database-specific APIs to the GDA model. The
middle layer is the GDA client library, which sits on top of the
CORBA interface to allow an easier access from client applications.
The middle layer also contains the GDA UI library, which provides a
way of easily accessing the client library from GNOME applications.
The top-level layer is composed of the applications making use of
the middle-level layer, such as the Rolodex application and the SQL
front end.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15efd88"></a>Gill and Eye of GNOME</h2></div></div><p>Gill (GNOME Illustrations) and Eye of GNOME (image viewer and
organizer) are the most recent additions to the suite of
productivity applications for GNOME.</p><p>Gill is particularly interesting, since its native file
format is the Web Consortium's Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).
Internally, the application has been organized around a Document
Object Model (also a W3C standard). Gill is still in its infancy,
but given that it is based on a strong foundation, it is already a
fairly powerful display.</p><p>Eye of GNOME is also in its infancy, but has served as a test
bed for various new GNOME technologies: our new imaging system,
various new GNOME Canvas improvements and the new
model-view-controller-based widgets. It is our image viewer of
choice right now and amazingly fast, too.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15eff40"></a>Development Tools</h2></div></div><p></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15f0048"></a>CORBA</h2></div></div><p>The lack of a standard, freely available system for component
programming is a problem present in the UNIX world today. One of
the issues being addressed by the GNOME project is providing such a
framework. The GNOME framework is based on the CORBA object model.
During the design of the GNOME component interfaces, we tried to
address a range of needs:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Automation: allow applications to be remotely
controlled. People should be able to launch and control GNOME
applications remotely. This is achieved by the GNOME Object
Activation Directory (GOAD), the supporting libraries (the GNORBA
libraries) and making use of the CORBA facilities for binding CORBA
to scripting languages.</p></li><li><p>Compound document creation: it is important to
design and implement the GNOME applications in such a way that they
will let the user create compound documents (those with contents
that may have been produced by different tools).</p></li><li><p>In-place document editing: the next step in
compound document creation is providing ways to edit embedded
documents inside a container application. This means it should be
possible to make changes to an embedded spreadsheet document inside
a word-processing document in a seamless fashion: it is important
to make this integration simple and easy to use.</p></li><li><p>Component reuse: filters and pipes proved to be
important building blocks in UNIX, but they are very limited: the
flow of control usually goes in a single direction, and the
protocol used to exchange information is too simple to meet today's
needs.</p></li><li><p>Desktop integration: the GNOME desktop deals with
CORBA interfaces to services. As far as an application is
concerned, only the published interface a program provides is
used.</p></li></ul></div><p>In GNOME, interfaces for specific tasks play an important
role. It is up to the user to choose which implementation of those
interfaces he uses. For example, the Mailer interface is
implemented by the GNOME Balsa mail reader, but it can also be
implemented by Emacs RMAIL, Emacs GNUS or the Mozilla mail reader.
If any of those provide the CORBA Mailer interface, they will work
properly with the GNOME desktop.
</p><p>All these needs can be met by the use of CORBA, an OMG
standard
(<a href="http://www.omg.org" target="_self">http://www.omg.org/</a>). We
are using ORBit as our CORBA implementation, with very good
results. ORBit was designed to be small, fast, robust, reliable and
efficient. Many times people hear the word CORBA, and they
immediately think &ldquo;bloat&rdquo;. This is not the case with ORBit. ORBit
is thin: for most applications, the working set of ORBit's ORB is
around 30K, which makes it suitable for embedding in almost every
application. This is exciting, because applications such as
Gnumeric and a few others export their internals to the desktop as
highly specialized reusable components (think &ldquo;UNIX filters on
steroids&rdquo;).</p><p>CORBA has proved to be very useful, as we can use it to run
regression tests on our applications from a Perl script using Owen
Taylor's wonderful CORBA-Perl
(<a href="http://people.redhat.com/otaylor/corba/orbit.html" target="_self">people.redhat.com/otaylor/corba/orbit.html</a>).
This just happens to be one of our favorite CORBA bindings for a
scripting language, but you can get CORBA bindings for almost every
language.</p><p>By using CORBA as our foundation, we ensure interoperability
with existing systems, and anyone who supports CORBA can talk to
our applications. CORBA in GNOME plays the same role COM plays in
the world of Microsoft Windows.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15f0728"></a>Bonobo</h2></div></div><p>Bonobo is the GNOME foundation for writing and implementing
reusable software components. Components are pieces of software
that provide a well-defined interface and are designed to be used
in conjunction with other components. In the Bonobo universe, CORBA
is used as the communication layer that binds components together.
More about component programming can be found in the Bonobo
documentation.</p><p>In short, Bonobo provides the following features to an
application developer:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>An infrastructure for creating reusable components
as full-blown processes, shared libraries or remote
processes.</p></li><li><p>An infrastructure for reusing existing components.
For example, you can use Gnumeric to provide data-entry facilities
in your own application or as a computation engine.</p></li><li><p>An infrastructure for creating persistent
controls.</p></li><li><p>An infrastructure for creating compound documents.
This means not only reusing existing applications in a vertical
application, but creating single documents composed of various
parts: spreadsheets, equations, graphics and so on.</p></li></ul></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3754f5.large.jpg"><img src="3754f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5. Updated GNOME Screenshot: New HTML

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15f0db0"></a>Image Handling</h2></div></div><p>GNOME 1.0 utilized the Imlib software library for image
loading and manipulation. While Imlib fits the needs of some
applications, its design does not mesh well with the typical GNOME
use case. As a replacement, libart, an RGBA image-manipulation
library, and GdkRGB, an API to allow high-performance display of
RGB images, are integrated together in gdk-pixbuf, an image-loading
library that solves the problems of Imlib and adds features such as
anti-aliasing and high-quality rendering.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15f0eb8"></a>Canvas and Libart</h2></div></div><p>GNOME 1.0 included libart and the anti-aliased canvas, but it
was not used very much, and the anti-aliased canvas was marked as
unstable. In the future, GNOME will use libart and the anti-aliased
canvas much more. The new GNOME panel and GNOME pixmap widget
already use libart and gdk-pixbuf to provide anti-aliased
icons.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15f0fc0"></a>Glade and Libglade</h2></div></div><p>Glade is a GUI designer which is currently being used in much
of the new GNOME development. Normally, Glade will generate source
code to build the interface you create. However, the truly
revolutionary and useful way to use Glade is in combination with
Libglade.</p><p>Libglade is a library that will load a saved Glade project
and build the interface for you&mdash;on the fly. This means you could
conceivably have different interface files for different languages,
application modes or themes. It also gives the user the ultimate
power of customization, since the interface of the application can
be modified without any programming skill.</p><p>Various GNOME applications are now designed with Glade, and
this substantially reduces their development time. It is easy to
prototype, easy to customize and easy to extend. The joy has
arrived.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15f1178"></a>Printing</h2></div></div><p>UNIX printing is both a blessing and a curse, and while it
may be flexible, it has always been hard to set up, and output
quality was often low on non-PostScript printers. In addition, most
applications didn't even include printing support, because no
convenient, unified API was available for printing on UNIX. GNOME
Print is a library which allows developers to easily add printing
capabilities to their applications, and users to quickly and easily
access all the output parameters through a consistent graphical
interface.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3754f6.large.jpg"><img src="3754f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 6. GNOME Desktop, Using
Anti-Aliasing</p></div></div>
</p><p>The GNOME Print imaging model is based on PostScript, with
two extensions: anti-aliasing and transparency. Please note that I
said &ldquo;an imaging model based on PostScript&rdquo;, not PostScript. You
have the same imaging model, but the way you print is by using an
API exported to your favorite language.</p><p>Currently, GNOME Print includes a PostScript driver, an
on-screen driver (for doing previews), meta-file drivers (for
storing printed information, transferring it, and rendering it on a
scaled context) and a generic RGB driver (on which we will build
the per-printer actual printer drivers).</p><p>As you might expect, we do reuse our technologies. The
rasterization engine used in the canvas is the same rasterization
engine used for the on-screen preview and for rasterizing the
output for the native printer drivers. If you are interested in
working on the native drivers, we most definitely welcome your
help.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15f1598"></a>Work in Progress</h2></div></div><p>The GNOME Project is not resting on its laurels. While the
1.0 release series addresses the basic need for a UNIX GUI,
portions of the existing implementation need refinement, as well as
additional features which are becoming essential on a modern
desktop.</p><p>At the same time, the GNOME 1.0 API will still be supported
through compatibility libraries, so that the migration of existing
source code to the new libraries will be painless. This will allow
developers to focus on the application development instead of
having to worry about following GNOME API changes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15f16f8"></a>The New File Manager</h2></div></div><p>The file manager is being completely redesigned. The new
version will feature an asynchronous, network transparent virtual
file system which is usable from all applications independent of
the file manager. This will make it easy to have applications that
are network aware, and it will make network administration a snap.
This step forward from traditional virtual file system libraries,
which are not asynchronous, allows better responsiveness from
graphical applications.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x1904da0"></a>Panel Improvements</h2></div></div><p>In addition to the file manager, another highly visible part
of the desktop is the panel. It is a place to put icons to launch
applications, access application menus, manage open windows and run
small utility applications that display the status of the machine,
play CDs or display time. We recognize that people are not the
same, and different people like to work differently. That is why
the panel is highly customizable, and this customization has been
greatly extended in the new version. The panel supports many new
and different modes of operation. For one, you can select a size
for your panels depending on your tastes and screen size. There are
also new modes to place panels anywhere along an edge, and even
anywhere on screen. In addition, all icons on the panel are now
anti-aliased, and external applets have the ability to use
anti-aliasing for their display. Many other smaller additions make
the panel more configurable and easier to use, and your GNOME
experience more pleasurable.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x1904ea8"></a>Configuration Data Storage</h2></div></div><p>Another noticeable improvement coming to GNOME is GConf, a
new configuration API and back end. This will add the features not
provided by the simplistic configuration API in GNOME 1.0. It will
make it easy to plug in different back ends for the actual storage,
so you can change how and where the data is actually stored without
touching the applications themselves.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x1904fb0"></a>Object Activation Framework</h2></div></div><p>Since many GNOME applications utilize CORBA, a framework for
locating and activating these applications is necessary. OAF, the
Object Activation Framework, provides a simple method for finding
and running the CORBA objects available on a computer system.
Distributed operation is supported, allowing activation of objects
on a network of computers being used in a GNOME desktop. The
flexibility of OAF enables it to be used outside of GNOME programs,
allowing non-GNOME CORBA applications to be utilized alongside
GNOME applications.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x19050b8"></a>Pango: Reaching Out to the World</h2></div></div><p>Supporting the various human languages is a complex task, not
because of the difficulty, but because of the wide range of
communication systems humans have came up with in the last few
thousand years.</p><p>Since our goal in the GNOME project is empowering users and
giving them a chance to run free software, we have to make sure
everyone on this planet can use our tools with their language, and
that our applications can be used by all people.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x1905218"></a>Gtk+</h2></div></div><p>Gtk+ is the toolkit used by GNOME and the various GNOME
applications. The Gtk+ team led by Owen Taylor and Tim Janik is
making steady progress towards the Gtk+ 1.4 release.</p><p>The major highlights of Gtk+ 1.4 include flicker-free
drawing, better internationalization support (through Pango), and
integration of the BeOS and Win32 ports.</p><p>Applications written against the Gtk+ 1.4 and GNOME APIs will
be portable to Windows and BeOS. (Keep in mind that GNOME/Gtk+
applications talk to a windowing system layer called Gdk, which is
independent of X11. This is why it is simple to port them to other
architectures.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x19053d0"></a>User Interface</h2></div></div><p>The people who brought you GNOME are programmers, and most
are not graphic designers. They do not have all the experience
required to make the best user interface possible. It is hard to
write good user interfaces, and we are trying to address this. The
GNOME User Interface team is responsible for redesigning the look
and feel of various GNOME applications by studying the current
application failures and using what is good from other applications
and systems.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x19054d8"></a>The Importance of Free Software</h2></div></div><p>GNOME is part of the GNU project, and it is free software
(some people call this open-source software), created for the
people by the people. We want to make software that grants users
various freedoms.</p><p>It is not software owned by some large faceless company. You,
therefore, are the person best qualified to contribute to its
improvement. Although programming help is extremely welcome, you
don't need to be able to program in order to help. Documentation,
translations, web site maintenance, packaging and graphic design
are just a few of the many areas where people are already making
contributions. If you dislike an aspect of GNOME and want it
improved or want a totally new feature added, the way to make this
change happen is to start contributing.</p><p>You might think any contribution you could make would be
unimportant, but if many people make small contributions, the
result is a large increase in the progress being made. Your efforts
for GNOME will continue to make the power of UNIX easily accessible
to average users.</p><p><a href="3754s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="3754s2.html" target="_self">Thanks</a></p><p><a href="3754s3.html" target="_self">Contributing to GNOME</a></p></div></div>
