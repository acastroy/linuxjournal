&ldquo;Never waste a crisis&rdquo;, Rahm Emanuel is said to have said
(<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/us/politics/10obama.html?_r=0" target="_self">www.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/us/politics/10obama.html?_r=0</a>).
And,
publishers&mdash;including <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>&mdash;have one now. According to PageFair
and Adobe, the
number of people blocking ads on their browsers has passed 200 million, worldwide,
increasing annually by 42% in the US and 82% in the UK. Most of the blockers also
block tracking, which is a main way that ads are aimed at readers through
on-line
publishers.
</p><p>
It's interesting to see how closely the rise in ad blocking follows the
rise in discussion of surveillance-fed advertising. Here are the years
when interest in those search terms first appeared, according to Google
Trends. The ones in italic and boldface are not arcane to tracking-based
advertising, but rather our response to it. 
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>

</p></li><li><p>

</p></li></ul></div><p>
The Google Trends graph shown in Figure 1 makes clear how people reacted to all this, especially
after Do Not Track failed.

The titles of ad blocking research studies
also tell a story (see Resources for links). First came Ad-Blocking
Measured,
published by ClarityRay (later acquired by Yahoo)
in 2012. Then PageFair brought us The Rise of Adblocking,
Adblocking goes mainstream
and The Cost of
Adblocking, in 2013,
2014 and 2015.
</p><p>
The catch-all term for tracking-based advertising is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>adtech</em></span>, and nobody has studied or written more wisely
about it than Don Marti, former Editor-in-Chief
of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>. When I asked Don to define adtech,
he said:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Adtech can have narrow or broad definitions.
</p><p>
The narrowest definition is a system that implements the Fundamental Value
Proposition of Adtech (as defined by Michael Tiffany,
<a href="http://www.whiteops.com/company" target="_self">www.whiteops.com/company</a>)&mdash;redirecting advertising
spending from high-value sites to low-value sites by tracking users. (See
&ldquo;Targeting
Failure: legit sites lose, intermediaries win&rdquo;:
<a href="http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/#targeting-failure-legit-sites-lose-intermediarieswin" target="_self">zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/#targeting-failure-legit-sites-lose-intermediarieswin</a>.)
</p><p>
An economic definition of adtech would be any system that relies on information
about the user to reduce the signaling value of an advertisement.
</p><p>
Google has search ads that have some adtech built in to them, but could work without
it and probably better. Some other Google ad products are pure adtech.
</p><p>
Facebook ads are pretty close to pure adtech.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
He defines signaling this way:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
In a market with asymmetric information, signaling is an action that sends a
credible message to a potential counterparty
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_%28economics%29" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_%28economics%29</a>).
</p><p>
Advertising spending is a form of signaling that shows that a seller
<span   class="emphasis"><em>has</em></span> the money
to advertise (which the seller presumably got from customers, or from investors who
thought the product was worth investing in), and <span   class="emphasis"><em>believes</em></span> that the product will earn
enough repeat sales to justify the ad spending.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
By blocking ads and tracking, users are marking down the value of digital
advertising to that of spam while also giving themselves a great deal
of leverage, both individually and collectively.
</p><p>
How will they use that leverage? I see two ways: 1) encouraging
advertising
with high signal value; and 2) signaling their own intentions, which
will be far more valuable than adtech's expensive guesswork could ever be.
</p><p>
The highest signal value is in old-fashioned brand advertising. This is
the uncomplicated kind that sustained all of commercial publishing and
broadcasting for centuries, never tracked anybody, and still makes up
most of the world's advertising (including your monthly <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>). At worst, it's annoying and wasteful; at best,
it's useful, interesting and a form of art. (Seen any beautiful adtech
lately? Or ever?)
</p><p>
For Madison Avenue, the mania around adtech has marginalized the creative
side of advertising, but I expect that to end when the adtech bubble
bursts, which it will, inevitably, given the steady growth of ad and
tracking blocking. Toward that, Don sees some synergies:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
IMHO, creative ad people and creative Web people could have an <span   class="bold"><b>awesome</b></span> conference if
we managed to exclude all surveillance marketing from it...Web people who think that
&ldquo;advertising&rdquo; is creepy are just as mixed up as advertising people who think that
&ldquo;the Web&rdquo; is creepy (<a href="http://zgp.org/~dmarti/business/fresh-start/#.VkusW9DvMUU" target="_self">zgp.org/~dmarti/business/fresh-start/#.VkusW9DvMUU</a>).
&ldquo;Big Data&rdquo; could be much, much more useful for everybody if
people would only stop thinking of it as a way to automate the carny trick of
putting chalk marks on audience members' backs
(<a href="http://www.heyrubecircus.com/fun-facts/origins-of-the-carnie-lingo-mark" target="_self">www.heyrubecircus.com/fun-facts/origins-of-the-carnie-lingo-mark</a>), and put it to uses that people agree
on and don't have to be hidden or made confusing. (Clicking &ldquo;I
agree&rdquo; is not
agreeing.)
</p><p>
Every set of new technologies has the obvious, &ldquo;hey we could do THIS
with it&rdquo;
application, and surveillance marketing is the one that a lot of people have come up
with for the Internet. But once we can get past it&mdash;and make the Net more
trustworthy for more people&mdash;there are a lot better opportunities out there.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
For expressing intent, we already have
<span   class="emphasis"><em>intentcasting</em></span>. Here the user, as a prospective
customer, tells the market what she is ready to buy (or, if she is
already a customer, what needs service).
</p><p>
I see intentcasting as a cornerstone of The Intention
Economy, a market development I first envisioned in 2006
and wrote up here in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>.
That same year I started
ProjectVRM at Harvard's Berkman
Center, with the intention of making
The Intention Economy happen. I wrote a book by the same title in 2012,
reporting on progress thus far and forecasting what it would do for the
business world. Here's the gist, from its introduction:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Over the coming years customers will be emancipated from systems built
to control them. They will become free and independent actors in the
marketplace, equipped to tell vendors what they want, how they want it,
where and when&mdash;even how much they'd like to pay&mdash;outside
of any vendor's system of customer control. Customers will be able to
form and break relationships with vendors, on customers' own terms, and
not just on the take-it-or-leave-it terms that have been <span   class="emphasis"><em>pro
forma</em></span> since Industry won the Industrial Revolution.... 
</p><p>
Relationships between customers and vendors will be voluntary
and genuine, with loyalty anchored in mutual respect and concern,
rather than coercion. So, rather than &ldquo;targeting&rdquo;,
&ldquo;capturing&rdquo;, &ldquo;acquiring&rdquo;,
&ldquo;managing&rdquo;, &ldquo;locking in&rdquo; and
&ldquo;owning&rdquo; customers, as if they were slaves or cattle,
vendors will earn the respect of customers who are now free to bring
far more to the market's table than the old vendor-based systems ever
contemplated, much less allowed. 
</p><p>
Likewise, rather than guessing what might get the attention of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>consumers</em></span>&mdash;or what might &ldquo;drive&rdquo;
them like cattle&mdash;vendors will respond to <span   class="emphasis"><em>actual
intentions</em></span> of <span   class="emphasis"><em>customers</em></span>. Once customers'
expressions of <span   class="emphasis"><em>intent</em></span> become abundant and clear,
the range of economic interplay between supply and demand will widen,
and its sum will increase. The result we will call the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Intention
Economy</em></span>. 
</p><p>
This new economy will outperform the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Attention
Economy</em></span> that has shaped marketing and sales since the dawn
of advertising. Customer intentions, well-expressed and understood,
will improve marketing and sales, because both will work with better
information, and both will be spared the cost and effort wasted on guesses
about what customers might want, and flooding media with messages that
miss their marks. Advertising will also improve. 
</p><p>
The volume, variety and relevance of information coming from customers
in the Intention Economy will strip the gears of systems built for
controlling customer behavior, or for limiting customer input. The quality
of that information will also obsolete or re-purpose the guesswork mills
of marketing, fed by crumb-trails of data shed by customers' mobile gear
and Web browsers. &ldquo;Mining&rdquo; of customer data will still be
useful to vendors, though less so than intention-based data provided
directly by customers. 
</p><p>
In economic terms, there will be high opportunity costs for vendors that
ignore useful signaling coming from customers. There will also be high
opportunity gains for companies that take advantage of growing customer
independence and empowerment.

published, we have 23 intentcasting developers listed on the ProjectVRM

</p></li></ul></div><p>
In &ldquo;Let's scale #intentcasting&rdquo;,
posted on the ProjectVRM blog in November, I call for
&ldquo;an open-source way to scale across multiple vendors with the same signaling
method&rdquo;, while also wondering &ldquo;if there is a semantic-ish
approach to Intentcasting.
By that I mean a vernacular of abbreviated simple statements of what one is looking
for&mdash;for example: '2br 2ba apt 10019' means a two-bedroom
and two-bath apartment in the
10019 zip code.&rdquo;
</p><p>
In the comments below, Bill Wendell of Real Estate Caf&eacute;
adds this to my example
above:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Intentcasting in real estate could deliver billions in consumer savings annually and
open up the choke hold on inventory (small number of active listings relative to
demand). There's also an important role for a large scale &ldquo;4th
party&rdquo; to
advocate for a consumer-centric open ecosystem as the industry transitions into the
future (<a href="https://blogs.law.harvard.edu/vrm/2011/04/13/fourth-parties-and-vrm" target="_self">https://blogs.law.harvard.edu/vrm/2011/04/13/fourth-parties-and-vrm</a>):
</p><p>
<a href="http://bit.ly/Back2Billions" target="_self">bit.ly/Back2Billions</a>
</p><p>
If you follow @CRTLabs you'll see Realtor IoT projects, and an Om.ie-like
(<a href="http://customercommons.org/2013/04/25/meet-omie-a-truly-personal-mobile-device" target="_self">customercommons.org/2013/04/25/meet-omie-a-truly-personal-mobile-device</a>)
initiative they're calling &ldquo;Rosetta Home&rdquo;. I'm generally a critic of the
industry but <a href="http://RESO.org" target="_self">RESO.org</a> is an independent standards group and their own hack
(PlugFest) suggests that their members might be open to FutureCommerce.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Kevin Cox 
of Welcomer
then offers this:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Both vendors and customers want the Intention Economy: vendors have the intention to
sell us goods and services and customers have the intention to buy the
vendor's
goods and services.
</p><p>
Ad blocking frees us to communicate with whom we want. Ad blocking is better termed
ad choice and ad choice is part of the intention economy.
</p><p>
Ad blocking is a precursor to a change in electronic communication. Ad blocking,
spam filters, silent telephone numbers, &ldquo;no junk mail&rdquo; signs, are what happens when
we get control over who and when and with whom we communicate and connect.
</p><p>
The Permanent Web (<a href="http://IPFS.io" target="_self">IPFS.io</a>) gives both vendors and customers the ability to create
electronic permanent identities. Welcomer is an early permanent identity technology
built on top of the Permanent Web. The permanent identity from Welcomer is a set of
distributed connections where the connections are peer to peer. There is no central
directory. There is no single identity. There are just peer to peer connections
where each party has rights. This approach is likely to prevail because the
connections are simple and include all existing id systems. Putting many
connections of different types together leads to complexity in the resulting
emergent structures. These are the conditions under which complexity and
adaptability to fit the environment evolve.
</p><p>
There are many ways to build a permanent web and we can expect there to be many
variations on IPFS.io such as CloudOS.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Those two comments address one vertical market (real estate)
and one horizontal market enabler (identity). Meanwhile, on
Twitter, James Ladd
of MyWave
(one of the intentcasting companies listed above) pushes back
against the
notion that some generalized answer covering all of both (as I had hoped
for) might be coming: &ldquo;same protocols/src is a pipe dream - just build
already!&rdquo; He's right, so far. (And building well.)
</p><p>
Yet lots of pipe dreams do come true. Back in the 1980s, when I worked
with Sun Microsystems and other competing UNIX makers, I despaired that
there would ever be a free (as in freedom) *nix in the world. Too many
giant tech companies were rolling their own, while weirdly trying to
reconcile all of them to AT&amp;T's SVR4 (System 5, Release 4). Then Linux
happened. And the Web. And universal e-mail, file transfer and the rest
of it. Can we do it for intentcasting?
</p><p>
Don't tell me. Just point to whatever work is happening.
