Give your users a better experience by improving client-side performance.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf0580.0xee83b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my last few columns, I've covered different ways to
understand, analyze and improve the performance of your Web
applications. I've shown that between your network connections, server
hardware, database design and HTTP server configuration, you can
change and improve the performance of your Web application&mdash;well, sort
of. Web applications, when they first started, were 
dynamic only on the server side. Sure, they output HTML&mdash;and later, CSS
and JavaScript&mdash;but the overwhelming majority of the processing and
computation took place on the server.
</p><p>
This model, of course, has changed dramatically in the last decade, to
such a degree that you now accurately can claim to be a Web developer
and work almost exclusively in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with little
or no server-side component. Entire MVC frameworks, such as Ember.js,
Angular.js and React.js, assume that you'll be writing your
application in JavaScript and provide you with the objects and
infrastructure necessary for doing so.
</p><p>
If you're worried about the performance of your Web application, you
need to concern yourself not only with what happens on the
server, but also with what happens in the browser. Some commercial
performance-monitoring solutions already take this into account,
allowing you to see how long it takes for elements to render, and then
to execute, on your users' browsers. However, there is also no
shortage of open-source tools available for you to check and improve
the ways in which your client-side programs are executing.
</p><p>
This month, I'm concluding this exploration of Web application
performance with a survey of things to keep in mind, as well as tools
that help ensure that you're actually doing what you should be.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf0580.0xee8670"></a>
Client-Side Considerations</h2></div></div><p>
Client-side code is written in JavaScript. The code, whether inline in
&lt;script&gt; tags or retrieved from a remote server, executes whenever the
browser's parser gets to that part of the page. If you have
JavaScript at the top of the page, it'll be executed when the
parser gets to it, potentially delaying the rendering of the rest of
your page. 
By contrast, if your JavaScript is at the bottom, the
parser will execute it only after parsing and rendering the
rest of the page. This is why so many developers learned to put their
JavaScript commands inside a &ldquo;document-ready&rdquo; callback function; in
that way, the code was executed only once the entire page had been
loaded.
</p><p>
Because so many modern Web applications take place in
JavaScript, the fact that you're often loading JavaScript from remote
servers means that the time it takes to render a page depends not just
on the server speed, the network bandwidth and the page's complexity,
but also on the servers and networks serving such JavaScript, as well
as those pages' complexity. As a result, it's generally considered to
be good practice to load as many libraries as possible late in the
game, at the bottom of your HTML page. That is, instead of having
your &lt;script&gt; tags, whether local or remote, at the top of your page,
you should put them at the bottom&mdash;unless it's vital to do
otherwise.
</p><p>
Even better, you should consolidate your JavaScript files into a
single file. This has a number of advantages. It means the user's
browser needs to download a single file, rather than many of them. If
you include all of the JavaScript needed on your site in a single
file, it also means that the file needs to be loaded only a
single time. On every subsequent page load, the JavaScript will be
mentioned, but it won't be downloaded, because it'll already be cached in
the browser's memory. You can make things even better, of course, by
compressing that single JavaScript file. This turns out to be
extremely effective, because compression algorithms work well with
text, and especially with text that repeats itself, as happens with
program code.
</p><p>
Better yet, you can run JavaScript code through a minimizer (or
&ldquo;minifier&rdquo;), which removes comments, extraneous whitespace and
anything else that isn't necessary for client-side programs to run. By
minifying JavaScript files, combining the files and then compressing
the resulting combination, you can dramatically reduce the size of the
JavaScript being sent to the user's browser and ensure that it is
loaded only once per visit to your Web site.
</p><p>
UglifyJS, for example, can be installed via <tt  >npm</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
npm install uglify-js -g
</pre>
</p><p>
You can run it on a file with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
uglifyjs FILENAME
</pre>
</p><p>
Although because that sends output to stdout, you'll likely want to
redirect it to a file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
uglifyjs FILENAME &gt; ugFILENAME.js
</pre>
</p><p>
I took the JavaScript from my PhD dissertation software and ran it
through both uglifyjs and gzip. The original 36KB file was 8.5KB
after compression, but 6.0KB after uglifying and compression. Although
you might scoff at the small size of a 36KB file in the modern world,
the fact is that each file takes time, for both the browser and the
server. The faster you can get it off your server and into the
browser, the better.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf0580.0xee8ca0"></a>
Download Time</h2></div></div><p>
Once the JavaScript is in the user's browser, things are both easier
and harder to analyze. On the one hand, you (the developer) can
download the program, test it and check the performance&mdash;and then,
you also can use in-browser debugging tools to test and improve
things.
</p><p>
One of the most important tools offered by both Chrome and Firefox is
the display of files being sent to the browser. Even if your site
appears to be loading and rendering quickly, a quick look at the
download timeline almost certainly will be somewhere between
surprising and shocking to you. You'll see how long it takes for each
of the JavaScript (and CSS, and image) files to download and, thus, how
much time it takes between the user requesting your page and the
content actually appearing on it. This is a great way for you to
identify potential bottlenecks and then reduce their effect on the
slowness (or apparent slowness) of your site.
</p><p>
Even New Relic, which normally is considered a (commercial)
server-side performance monitor, now offers some client-side
performance checking. You place a small piece of JavaScript on your
site; New Relic collects this information, and then tells you how long
it took for your content to get to the user's browser and how long it
took to render. This provides a surprisingly insightful view of
whether you need to work on improving the speed with which your files
are delivered or to optimize the code further, such that it runs
faster. There definitely are other options, but I've found that even
the free (not open-source, but free of charge) New Relic client-side
benchmarking to be quite useful and helpful.
</p><p>
Once you have combined and compressed your JavaScript files, you
seriously should consider putting them, as well as any other static
assets (such as CSS files and images), on a content distribution
network (CDN). A CDN handles only static content, but given how many
large, slow-to-download files are static, that often
can provide a significant improvement. CDNs not only have a great
deal of bandwidth, but they also copy your content to multiple servers,
using the geographically closest one to serve content to your
user. Thus, a user in Tokyo will receive data from a local CDN server,
whereas a Chicago-based user will receive it from a different CDN
server. So, using a CDN reduces the load on your main Web server,
while decreasing the actual and perceived download times.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf0580.0xee8f08"></a>
Benchmarking JavaScript</h2></div></div><p>
Although JavaScript has a (well deserved, I think) reputation for being a
frustrating and quirky language, the fact is that modern JavaScript
implementations run very quickly&mdash;assuming that you use the language
in the right way. However, it's sometimes hard to know where your
program is spending most of its time. Fortunately, the Chrome
developer tools (a part of the Chrome browser) include a profiling
tool. Go to the &ldquo;profile&rdquo; tab in the developer tools, and select the
CPU option before visiting your site. You can run through your site
for a few seconds or minutes before stopping the profiling from taking
place. Once you've done that, you'll get a (very long) indication of
which JavaScript programs were running, where they came from and how
much time the CPU spent in each one.
</p><p>
You similarly can ask the profiler to examine memory usage. The more
complex the application you're writing, the more necessary these tools
will be. At the same time, you'll likely find that when you profile
your JavaScript code, the most frequently used code probably will be
code you didn't write yourself, but rather that is part of the
underlying framework you're using. 
</p><p>
In Firebug, the Firefox-based debugger, you can profile a page by
going to the &ldquo;console&rdquo; tab and clicking on
&ldquo;profile&rdquo;. You'll see a
table showing how much time was spent in each function, and what
percentage of the total time was spent there. If you're a Chrome
user, you can open up the developer tools and click on the
&ldquo;profiles&rdquo; tab. You'll then need to choose whether you want to check CPU
performance or memory performance (in two different flavors). After
starting and stopping the profiler, you can analyze the resources
that JavaScript used&mdash;and then, of course, change your code
appropriately.
</p><p>
One tool I have begun to use more frequently is PageSpeed from
Google. This collection of tools would appear to be an SaaS, an updated
version of YSlow, which was my go-to tool for many years. For
example, Google's tools will tell you how mobile-friendly your site
is.
</p><p>
Moreover, the PageSpeed results always point to documentation that
describes, in great detail, why issues are problematic and what steps
you can take in order to fix them. This documentation is surprisingly
well written, and it points to very practical, clear suggestions for how
to improve the performance of your JavaScript and CSS. After running
PageSpeed against one of my client's sites, I found that we still had
some blocking JavaScript higher up than is perhaps necessary. It also
suggested which images could be compressed and how much space we
would save in so doing.

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
Although server-side programming still is a vital part of the Web, the
client is where much of the action is, and where the user often
perceives lags and slowness. As a result, it's worth investing time
to check your client-side performance and to address problems before
your users start to complain (or leave you without complaining).
Using a variety of tools to check your performance, as well as to
reduce the size and time of JavaScript and CSS downloads, will go a
long way toward improving your users' satisfaction with your site.
