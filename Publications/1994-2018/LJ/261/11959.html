For his 120th column, Dave looks at time around the
universe&mdash;programmatically, that is!

This marks my 120th column for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>. 120
times I've delved
into the retro world of shell script programming. You've gotten ten years of my
puns and wry asides&mdash;all available on the <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com</a> site for your
reading pleasure! 
</p><p>
At approximately 1,200 words/column that represents 144,000 words total. By
comparison, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</em></span>
is 76,944 words.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Hobbit</em></span> is 95,356 words, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pride and
Prejudice</em></span> is 122,685. So there you
have it. In those 144k words, I could have created a magical universe with
an endearing young hero, or a different magical world with a plucky
Hobbit adventurer (albeit reluctant adventurer), or I could have written about five
daughters of marrying age, the charming Mr. Bingley and the haughty Mr.
Darcy.
</p><p>
I have, of course, done none of those things. But on the bright side, I'm
hoping you've been entertained while learning about shell script
programming, programming techniques and how divide and conquer can help
you solve even the most thorny of challenges. I'm sure Harry would
approve!
</p><p>
This leaves me with the question: what should I do with the next ten
years? That question's only slightly intimidating, of course, but given
that UNIX is 45 years old (I'm using 1970 as the first launch date,
back on an old PDP-7), and Linux is 24 years old (using 1991 as the date
Torvalds begin developing his alternative to UNIX), there's still 
some time to go.
</p><p>
For this article, I thought it'd be fun to talk about space.
Specifically, to write a script that would tell you what your age would be
if you lived on one of the other planets in our solar system. So let's
jump in!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe90580.0xf88828"></a>
Calculating Universe Age</h2></div></div><p>
Different planets revolve around the sun at different rates. Earth is easy.
It takes the planet just a bit more than 365 days (a day being a full day/night
cycle and based on the rotation of the planet) to circle the sun&mdash;an Earth
year.
</p><p>
But what about the other planets? We could calculate day-length and then
number of days for each planet's &ldquo;native&rdquo; orbit, but it's
more fun to have this be based on Earth days, although when we get to Pluto
(yeah, I still consider it a planet), it's rather a long time.
</p><p>
Here's the data, in 24-hour Earth days:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Mercury	87.96
Venus	224.68
Earth	365.26
Mars	686.98
Jupiter	11.862 years
Saturn	29.456 years
Uranus	84.07 years
Neptune	164.81 years
Pluto	247.7 years
</pre>
</p><p>
We will need to convert the last five into Earth days, but that's easy:
just multiply by 365.26 (to be accurate), which gives us this better
reference chart, presented as variables ready for a script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mercury=87.96
venus=224.68
earth=365.26
mars=686.98
jupiter=4332.71412
saturn=10759.09856
uranus=30707.4082
neptune=60198.5006
pluto=90474.902
</pre>
</p><p>
It sure takes a while for Pluto to circle our solar system, doesn't it?
It's 90,474 days.
</p><p>
For this script, we'll want users to enter their birthdays, calculate
how many days it's been since they were born, then simply divide that
number by the &ldquo;year&rdquo; on each planet to calculate their universe
ages.
</p><p>
I've actually written about how to calculate days between a specific
date in the past and the current day, but rather than show the exhaustive
calculation, let's just lean on the <tt  >date</tt>
function&mdash;more
specifically GNU <tt  >date</tt>. It's quite likely what you have on your
computer already, and you can find out simply by typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;
$ date --version
date (GNU coreutils) 8.23
Copyright (C) 2014 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later
&lt;http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html&gt;.
This is free software: you are free to change and 
redistribute it. There is NO WARRANTY, to the 
extent permitted by law.

</pre>
</p><p>
This is on the latest version of Ubuntu. Sadly, I'm going to be leaving
you Mac users who have become accustomed to working with my scripts in the
dust this time. Unfortunately, Mac OS X still ships with the older POSIX
version of <tt  >date</tt> and therefore has no
<tt  >date</tt> math available.
With GNU <tt  >date</tt>, however, it's super easy to calculate the number of days
you've been alive. Let's assume you, like me, were born on August
3, 1965 (my birthday, plus or minus a year or three). How many days have I
been alive?
</p><p>
The one-liner:

<pre     class="programlisting">
daysalive=$(( ( $(date -ud 'aug 3 1965' +'%s') - 
 &#8618;$(date -u +'%s') )/60/60/24 ))
</pre>
</p><p>
This has my birthday hard-coded, probably not what we want, so instead it
could be modified to work with user input, as a first step toward actually
creating a script:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat planetaryage.sh 
#!/bin/sh
daysalive="$(( ( $(date -ud "$*" +'%s') - 
 &#8618;$(date -u +'%s') )/60/60/24 ))"
echo "Born on $* means you've been alive $daysalive days."
exit 0
$ sh planetaryage.sh aug 3 1965
Born on aug 3 1965 means you've been alive -18354 days.
</pre>
</p><p>
Negative days. It seems like something you'd get out of an old <span   class="emphasis"><em>Night
Gallery</em></span> show or perhaps <span   class="emphasis"><em>Black Mirror</em></span>, to be a bit more contemporary. But
why? Because we're subtracting the current date from the day in the
past, not vice versa. 
</p><p>
Flipping the math around in the equation solves the problem and gets the
desired result:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Born on aug 3 1965 means you've been alive 18354 days.
</pre>
</p><p>
Now the rest of the script is quite easy, particularly since we've
already translated each and every planet's orbital duration into Earth
days. To demonstrate, 18,354 Earth days would make me 26.71 (18354 / 686.98)
Martian years old.
</p><p>
Here's the full script:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat planetaryage.sh 
#!/bin/sh

mercury=87.96; venus=224.68; earth=365.26
mars=686.98; jupiter=4332.71412; saturn=10759.09856
uranus=30707.4082; neptune=60198.5006; pluto=90474.902

planetaryAge()
{
  orbit=$1
  planetname=$2
  planetarydays=$( echo "scale=5;$daysalive / $orbit"|bc )
  echo "You are $planetarydays $planetname years old."
}

daysalive="$(( ( $(date -u +'%s') - 
 &#8618;$(date -ud "$*" +'%s') )/60/60/24 ))"

planetaryAge $mercury "Mercury"
planetaryAge $venus   "Venus"
planetaryAge $earth   "Earth"
planetaryAge $mars    "Mars"
planetaryAge $jupiter "Jupiter"
planetaryAge $saturn  "Saturn"
planetaryAge $uranus  "Uranus"
planetaryAge $neptune "Neptune"
planetaryAge $pluto   "Pluto"

exit 0
</pre>
</p><p>
It's actually not too complicated. When I run it for my own birthday, I find out
I'm quite a spring chicken on Neptune:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh planetaryage.sh aug 3 1965
You are 208.66302 Mercury years old.
You are 81.68951 Venus years old.
You are 50.24913 Earth years old.
You are 26.71693 Mars years old.
You are 4.23614 Jupiter years old.
You are 1.70590 Saturn years old.
You are .59770 Uranus years old.
You are .30489 Neptune years old.
You are .20286 Pluto years old.
</pre>
</p><p>
What about duration since the signing of the Declaration of Independence?
Those numbers are a bit more interesting:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh planetaryage.sh july 4 1776
You are 993.79263 Mercury years old.
You are 389.05999 Venus years old.
You are 239.31993 Earth years old.
You are 127.24387 Mars years old.
You are 20.17534 Jupiter years old.
You are 8.12465 Saturn years old.
You are 2.84667 Uranus years old.
You are 1.45209 Neptune years old.
You are .96616 Pluto years old.
</pre>
</p><p>
Ah, it was almost one Plutonian year ago. It's simple enough once you know the
mathematical capabilities of GNU <tt  >date</tt>, for sure.
Without it, you 
definitely can cobble together a script that can calculate the number of days
since a specified date in the past, but we've done that before!
