<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #261, January 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
There's an ongoing impulse among a diversity of developers to be able to
compile some or all of the Linux kernel as a library, so that a piece of
software could use kernel services and APIs while running under a different
kernel entirely, or a different operating system.
</p><p>
This time, the impulse came from <span   class="bold"><b>Octavian
Purdila</b></span>, creator of the <span   class="bold"><b>Linux
Kernel Library</b></span> (LKL), essentially an entire kernel compiled as a static
library. He distinguished LKL from projects like <span   class="bold"><b>User Mode Linux</b></span> (UML),
saying that LKL was more lightweight, having no infrastructure
requirements or needing any particular sort of runtime environment.
</p><p>
A bunch of folks expressed interest, especially in terms of interacting
with similar projects like <span   class="bold"><b>libOS</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>libguestFS</b></span>. And, <span   class="bold"><b>Richard Weinberger</b></span>
remarked that LKL seemed to solve UML's biggest pain points: the need to
use <span   class="bold"><b>ptrace()</b></span> to handle system calls and to do virtual memory management
using <span   class="bold"><b>SIGSEGV</b></span>.
</p><p>
In a device-centric world with heavy, inefficient battery technology,
there's a big incentive to figure out ways to save power. One possibility
is to turn off portions of hardware when they're currently not in use, like a
phone's touchscreen when the phone is in your pocket.
</p><p>
The difficulty lies in knowing exactly which piece of hardware to turn off,
and when. If there's a clear user action, like flipping closed a
flip-phone, the problem is simplified. <span   class="bold"><b>Irina
Tirdea</b></span> recently tried to
recognize such actions and come up with mechanisms to respond to
them properly. She posted some patches to do this.
</p><p>
Octavian Purdila, also working on the project with Irina, described a
target scenario as being when a touchscreen has been blanked but is still
aware of the user's touch&mdash;through the fabric of a pocket, for example. The
goal of the patches, he said, would be to save power by turning off all the
hardware associated with that screen, and turn everything on again when the
user activates the device.
</p><p>
The problem with this sort of feature is that it could be implemented along
any of a number of different layers of the kernel code. The ideal location
could make the difference between a complex, easily broken implementation
and a simple, efficient implementation. Several folks felt that Irina and
Octavian's approach was in the wrong part of the kernel, and the discussion
devolved into a consideration of completely different approaches.
</p><p>
No consensus arose, although the allure of power-savings will undoubtedly keep
the debate alive.
</p><p>
Mounting a filesystem under a virtual machine can be tricky. Security
privileges and restrictions need to be respected, or else a filesystem
could become a vector of attack by a malicious user. This particular area
of kernel development also tends to have a wide appeal among companies
trying to support their products, so it's possible for a variety of
developers to find themselves working at cross purposes and need to
accommodate each other before their patches can be accepted.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Seth Forshee</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Eric Biederman</b></span>, for example, recently wrote some patches
to allow mounting <span   class="bold"><b>Ext4</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>FUSE</b></span> filesystems by unprivileged users,
ignoring the security information that otherwise might prevent those users
from accessing that data.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, <span   class="bold"><b>Lukasz Pawelczyk</b></span> was working on code specifically to support that
same security information.
</p><p>
A debate sprang up over the particular context involved. <span   class="bold"><b>Andy Lutomirski</b></span>
suggested that if a filesystem contained a user's own data, it would be
fine to override security features, on the grounds that users should be
able to do what they wanted with their own data. While <span   class="bold"><b>Casey Schaufler</b></span>
replied that the kernel shouldn't care what the user knew about the data,
it had to follow the security protocols or else it wouldn't be able to
enforce them at all.
</p><p>
On the other hand, as Eric pointed out, filesystems like <span   class="bold"><b>FAT</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Minix</b></span>
weren't capable of storing the same type of security information as more
modern filesystems. There had to be a way, he said, to mount such filesystems without requiring them to support security features they couldn't
support.
</p><p>
It's an ongoing debate. Security trumps all other considerations, including
dire need, so an issue like unprivileged filesystem mounts inevitably
will involve a consideration of the specific context in which a user might try
to do something. Often there's some kind of crazy nuance that makes
something feasible when you could have sworn it never would be feasible.

<h2 class="title">ABINIT for Chemists</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #261, January 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The single largest group of users on high-performance computing
clusters has to be the chemists. Their CPU-year count is definitely at the
very top of the list. Because of this heavy use, several
different packages have become standard tools that most computational
chemistry researchers use. So in this article, I take
an introductory look at one called ABINIT (<a href="http://www.abinit.org" target="_self">www.abinit.org</a>). 
</p><p>
ABINIT calculates the energy and
structure of groups of nuclei and electrons. The method used to make these
calculations is Density Functional Theory (DFT,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory</a>). If you want to know more
about the underlying theory, feel free to go talk to your nearest
computational chemist. 
</p><p>
Although my exposure has been with people running
ABINIT on scores of machines in parallel, at least in a learning
environment or for small systems, nothing is stopping you from
running it on your own desktop. The first step, of course, is to install it
on your machine. You may have packages within your distribution to make
installation easier. For example, on Debian-based systems, you can install
it with:
  
<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install abinit abinit-data abinit-doc
</pre>
</p><p>
The only issue with that method is you probably will get an older
version of ABINIT. At the time of this writing, the Ubuntu package installs
version 7.8.2, while on the Web site, you can download version 7.10.5. 
</p><p>
If
you need the latest available code, you always can get the source code from
the main home page and compile it yourself on your local machine. In order
to build it yourself, you need the usual utilities to build other
packages, such as make, libtool and autoconf. Because the majority of the
code is written in FORTRAN, you also need a compiler capable of
compiling F90 code. This will allow you to build a basic version of ABINIT.
You can include extra functionality, such as MPI or NetCDF, if you have
them available on your system.
</p><p>
The main executable to run these calculations is called
<tt  >abinit</tt>. It takes
a number of input files in order to do the actual calculation. One of these
input files is actually a file of files. It is a file that contains a list
of other input files that abinit needs to read in. The usual filename
ending is &ldquo;.files&rdquo;. If you have this input file, you can run your
simulation with:
  
<pre     class="programlisting">

abinit &lt; my_input.files &gt;&amp; log

</pre>
</p><p>
This tells abinit to read the input data from standard input (attached to
the file my_input.files) and to write its results to standard output
(attached to the file log). The log file only captures output that gets
written out to the standard output stream. There is a lot more output that
is written out. These other output files are defined in the
my_input.files file. The following list is a more-detailed description of
the contents:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
ab_in &mdash; main input file.
</p></li><li><p>
ab_out &mdash; main output file.
</p></li><li><p>
abi &mdash; root filename for other input files.
</p></li><li><p>
abo &mdash; root filename for other output files.
</p></li><li><p>
tmp &mdash; root filename for temporary files.
</p></li><li><p>
my.psp &mdash; the pseudopotential used for this run.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The root names &ldquo;abi&rdquo;, &ldquo;abo&rdquo; and
&ldquo;tmp&rdquo; are used to create the multiple files
for each of those sections. 
</p><p>
There are a few rules around the input
files that may cause problems if you don't follow them. The first is that
you can't have tab characters in your input file. So, be sure that your
editor uses space characters when you press the tab key. The second rule
has to do with
using negative numbers. There can't be any spaces between the
negative sign and the first digit of the number. The last formatting rule
is that no line can be more than 132 characters. If any lines end up longer
than that, ABINIT simply will ignore the extra content. If you get errors
when trying to run your own jobs, those are the first few places you should
check. 
</p><p>
There are a massive number of input variables that allow you to
control parameters around file handling, geometry, structure optimization
and response functions, among many others. These input variables can be in
any order. The entire file gets parsed before the calculations start. When
you start creating your own input files, you probably will want to be able
to check them somehow. Luckily, you can use ABINIT itself to do this. The
<tt  >abinit</tt> executable includes an option
(<tt  >-d</tt> or <tt  >--dry-run</tt>) to take your input
files and validate them without starting the calculations. This allows you
at least to catch major typos before wasting the time involved in doing a
partial run and having it fail.
</p><p>
Along with your own input files, describing the geometry and other
descriptive variables, ABINIT needs input files that describe something
called the pseudopotential for your system. There are different types, such
as Troullier-Martins or Hartwigsen-Goedecker-Hutter pseudopotentials, that
can be used for different situations. Luckily, ABINIT includes
pseudopotentials for the entire periodic table. This means you 
simply can build up your molecule by including the pseudopotentials for each of
the different types of atoms in your system. Although it isn't necessary in
most cases, you can create your own for some very specialized system if
needed. 
</p><p>
The other thing to be aware of is that ABINIT is released under a
GPL license. This means you have access to all of the source code and
can investigate exactly how the calculations are being done. When doing
fundamental scientific research, that can be very important. You may be
trying to do calculations in a region where the available algorithm is no
longer valid. All of these calculations make assumptions to try to
simplify the calculations so that they are actually doable, and it is very
important to keep that in mind. But, with access to the code, you have the
opportunity to make changes to those algorithms to fit the
assumptions better that are valid for your problem. This open-source code gives
you the ability to build on all of the past work and push it into new
areas of research. Just remember to pass these extensions and improvements
on to the next group of researchers to keep pushing our understanding
forward.
</p><p>
Interpreting the output from ABINIT can be a bit of a job. There is a lot
of output describing how the calculated values progressed until they
reached the requested accuracy to the actual answer. For example, if you
are calculating the energy for a molecular configuration, you probably are
interested in when the energy is at its lowest value. This will be the most
stable configuration for these nuclei and electrons. But, how do you
interpret this output? Several tools are available to take the
geometric portion of this output and plot it so that you can see what the
configuration actually looks like. There also will be output describing how
strong the various connections are between the nuclei, which you can use to
see how reactive your molecule may be.
</p><p>
This is just a very basic introduction to what is involved when
using ABINIT. Hopefully, you now feel a bit more comfortable
digging in to the massive documentation and using ABINIT to solve whatever
molecular problem you have. When you are ready, you can move on to
much larger problems by using the MPI capabilities in ABINIT to use as
many machines as you have available.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Quality Time, or Not?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #261, January 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
This is the season of resolutions, and in the technological world we
live in, spending time off-line is a difficult but healthy activity. The
problem is our lives have become so intertwined with our phones that
it's easy to whip out our cell phones inadvertently to check our
social networks quickly.
</p><p>
The QualityTime app is designed to help curb the habit just a
bit. Ironically, it's an Android app designed to help you stop using
Android apps so much. Still, it's just geeky enough to make limiting
technology time a fun endeavor. If you like graphs, data, numbers and
goals, QualityTime can help you identify where you spend most of your
time on-line and then assist in lessening your face time with FaceTime
(okay, not actually FaceTime, since that's an Apple app, but the word play
was too fun to leave out).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11953androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="11953androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
If you're forgetting what your family members actually look like,
or if you're surprised to see your friends as anything but their on-line
avatars, you really need to give QualityTime a try. If you just want
to see how much time you spend on various applications on your Android
device, you should try QualityTime as well. I found the data
alone worth the installation, and it inspired me to spend a little less
time texting my kids and a little more time talking to them (while
they text their friends&mdash;baby steps...).

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Open-Source Windows?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #261, January 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I have mixed emotions about ReactOS. It's open source. It's freely
available. But, its goal is to be binary-compatible with Windows! ReactOS
is not a Linux operating system. In fact, it doesn't share the UNIX
architecture at all. It looks like Windows NT, and it behaves much like
Windows NT.
</p><p>
It's just odd!
</p><p>
The best way I can think to describe it is to imagine if Wine evolved
into an entire operating system that booted on hardware instead of
running inside Linux. That's basically what ReactOS feels like. It's
not ready for prime time (and the developers make that very clear&mdash;it's alpha software), but it's worth checking out. Since it's early in
the development process, if you get involved now, you can have a say in
what compatibilities get priority.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11953fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="11953fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
ReactOS is the perfect solution for folks who need to run Windows apps,
but absolutely refuse to run Microsoft code. I'm personally not convinced
that ReactOS is a better idea than Wine running inside Linux, but I'm sure
running it as its own operating system will provide possibilities that
just can't happen in a Wine environment. The folks at ReactOS provide
installers and prebuilt VM instances that can be launched in order
to try it out on your existing system. Whether you are just morbidly
curious about a non-Windows Windows or are interested in getting
involved in the development, go to <a href="http://reactos.org" target="_self">reactos.org</a> for
more details.

<h2 class="title">Dear Kodi, Where's My Surround?!?!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #261, January 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I love Kodi. (This is just an evolution of my love for XBMC, since it's
the same thing with a new name.) In fact, although I've expressed my love
for Plex over and over (and over) the past few years, I still use Kodi
as my main interface for the televisions in my house. We gave Plex a
try as our main media center software when it was released for TiVo,
but after several months, we found its interface to be cumbersome and the
transcoding for local media frustrating.
</p><p>
So during the holidays, I once again installed Kodi on Raspberry Pi devices
around my house. Using OpenELEC, the installation process itself is
painless. Heck, even centralizing the library database was painless. The
frustrating part was getting 5.1 surround sound to work.
</p><p>
On the bedroom televisions, surround sound is a moot point, because I
just use whatever stereo speakers are included in the TV. For our main
media center, however, I have a fancy Sonos PLAYBAR with subwoofer and
rear channel speakers. The only audio connection the PLAYBAR accepts is
optical audio, so I bought an inexpensive HDMI audio extractor. (This
one works great: <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00BIQER0E" target="_self">smile.amazon.com/dp/B00BIQER0E</a>.)
</p><p>
The problem is that when Kodi is set to 5.1 audio output, the center
channel is missing! There's a bit of disagreement as to whether it's a
bug in Kodi/OpenELEC or just a result of optical audio supporting
only two channels of audio. (If that seems odd to you, it was to me too. But
apparently, it supports only two channels, which contain all the surround
information, or something like that.) The non-intuitive solution is to
force Kodi to 2.0 audio. Although it doesn't seem to make sense, I can vouch
for it working. Kodi sends the audio as 2.0 stereo, which is transferred
over optical (or HDMI, whatever you're using), and then the receiver
decodes the surround information from that two-channel signal.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11953kodif1.large.jpg"><img src="11953kodif1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
The tl;dr version is that Kodi will send the surround sound information
over two-channel audio, so if you are missing your center channel, try
switching to 2.0 audio.

If you're anything like me, the holiday season is spent fixing Wi-Fi and
removing spyware. Occasionally, I get to install Linux for a relative who
is ready to give up Windows or needs something that will run on a
circa-Windows 2000 computer (Xubuntu is usually my choice). The problem
with helping friends and relatives with their computers over the holidays
is that you become their first call when something goes wrong. You 
either can fight it or make it easier on yourself by preparing in advance.
</p><p>
I love Team Viewer. It's not an open-source program, but it's free for
personal use with no frustrating limitations. Plus, it runs on Windows,
OS X and Linux. The best part is how easy it is to use. I generally don't
set up the &ldquo;automatic availability&rdquo; feature that logs the computer
in to the Team Viewer network automatically on boot. I like to use the
standard startup, which requires users to call me with the code on their
screen. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11953teamf1.large.jpg"><img src="11953teamf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
The best thing about Team Viewer is how easily it handles NAT
situations. Since the software connects to the Team Viewer servers, those
servers act like a connection broker, meaning there are no router ports
to forward and no proxies to set up. As long as the computer is on-line,
you should be able to take over and help someone. Again,
you might not like the ease with which you'll be able to help, but having
access to a user's computer in real time is so much nicer than explaining
to Uncle Harry what &ldquo;right click&rdquo; means.
</p><p>
Due to its free license for personal use, cross-platform compatibility
and incredible ease of use, Team Viewer gets this month's Editors'
Choice award. It's not new software, but after a stretch of holidays,
I'm reminded just how nice it is to have installed on all my relatives'
computers. Be sure to install the client before you leave their houses,
or else be prepared to explain software installation over the phone! Get
your copy at <a href="http://teamviewer.com" target="_self">teamviewer.com</a>.
