Server Hardening&mdash;ipset:set</h4><p>
Regarding Greg Bledsoe's &ldquo;Server Hardening&rdquo; article in the
November 2015 issue: 
I created a modified script for generating ipset blocklists. Namely it
creates a set of ipsets, one a hash:net and the other a hash:ip. The script
generates a second script called blset.sh, which adds the IP addresses to
the ipset hashes. The blset.sh script first adds all the hash:net entries
from the various sources, then the hash:ip set is created, but entries are
not added if they already exist in the hash:net set.
</p><p>
The new script does not exceed the ipset size limit. The suggested script
in Greg's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> article puts all IPs into a
hash:ip, which quickly
becomes too large. The script is at <a href="https://github.com/zuikway/tlj_blocklist" target="_self">https://github.com/zuikway/tlj_blocklist</a>.

Server Hardening, II</h4><p>
Greg Bledsoe missed one small thing that can increase a server's
security: reduce the amount of network traffic a server must process:


<pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -t mangle -I PREROUTING -m state --state INVALID -j DROP
</pre>
</p><p>
<tt  >INVALID</tt> packets are those that must belong to an established
connection, yet netfilter has no connection recorded for it. They are
&ldquo;spurious&rdquo; packets that cannot be delivered, so they should be dropped
as early as possible. It isn't worth spending one extra CPU cycle on
these packets. Although it won't eliminate the ill effects of a DDoS
attack, it can significantly reduce the time the CPU spends handling
<tt  >INVALID</tt> packets.

Find Words</h4><p>
Dave Taylor's Work the Shell column in the September&ndash;November 2015
issues covers a fun toy program near and dear
to my heart. I've been using a very similar de-jumbling algorithm to
strengthen my scripting in Perl and Python&mdash;although I must admit I
haven't been ambitious enough to implement it in bash! It was cool to
see Dave use the nearly the same approach I came up with myself. I
figured it might be interesting to share my own variation to the same
problem.
</p><p>
Considering that modern machines are overkill for most scripts, I
started off simply alphabetizing the entire dictionary (first in
/usr/share/dict/words, and later a set of professional
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span>
word lists I found on-line). In my language du jour, I construct a
massive hash keyed on the alphabetized words, with an array of
matching original words as the value.
For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$list{'abt'} -&gt; ['bat', 'tab']
</pre>
</p><p>
All in all, this approach takes only a few seconds on a five-year-old
laptop, and 21MB of RAM for the data structure.
</p><p>
The next fun part was digging into my computer science background and
using a recursive algorithm to deconstruct the input letter sets by
calling the same function minus a different letter each time and
looking up the result in the hash. Putting the input function into a
loop (checking for EOF or &ldquo;q&rdquo; for termination) allows you to perform
multiple searches against the hash you've spent several busy
CPU-seconds constructing.
</p><p>
Keep on hacking!

<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span> Great to hear from you, Chandler, and glad my column
brought you some enjoyment as you realized we'd taken the same
algorithmic approach to the word jumble algorithm!

AWS EC2 VPC CLI</h4><p>
Thanks for an excellent journal. I really enjoy it and love the
digital version on my Kindle.
</p><p>
The reason I'm writing is just a general hint to Kyle Rankin's great
article on the EC2 CLI in the October 2015 issue. I have myself gone through an identical
process for exactly the same reasons in changing to the Python CLI.
The only thing I chose to do differently in the end was processing the
output. I, on occasion, had issues in processing the text output of the
Java CLI in that it sometimes changed slightly between versions,
forcing me to stick to a certain version or adapt my awk|perl|grep
processing of the text output. Text output for the Python CLI was
bigger and a bit trickier to parse well&mdash;enter JSON output. As Kyle
writes, the Python CLI offers the option of different outputs,
including JSON. It's a slightly steeper learning curve, but using the JSON
output together with the jq JSON command-line parser makes processing
anything from the CLI straightforward and keeps me safe from EC2 CLI
adding fields or new lines, etc., that may break by text processing! One can
always script things prettier, but being a one-liner fan, one can, for
example, get all the volume IDs for one's servers:


<pre     class="programlisting">
aws ec2 describe-instances | jq -r
 &#8618;'.Reservations[].Instances[].BlockDeviceMappings[].Ebs.VolumeId'
</pre>
</p><p>
Taking it a little further, snapshot every EBS volume, but only if it
does not belong to a certain tag (or do it the other way around and
snapshot only a given tag) and snapshot only those that are mounted on
a given device name:


<pre     class="programlisting">
aws ec2 describe-instances | jq -r '.Reservations[].Instances[] |
 &#8618;select(contains({Tags: [{Key: "SomeKey",Value: 
 &#8618;"SomeValue"} ]}) | not) | .BlockDeviceMappings[] | 
 &#8618;select(contains({DeviceName: "/dev/sda"})) | .Ebs.VolumeId' 
 &#8618;| parallel aws ec2 create-snapshot
 &#8618;--description "backup_`date +\%Y\%m\%d`" --volume-id
</pre>
</p><p>
<tt  >parallel</tt> is a great trick to call the command on every volume ID.
I would often use xargs and give multiple IDs in one call, but with the
Python CLI, I could give each call only one volume ID. I add the date
to the description for a better overview of snapshots and a simple way
to monitor and delete given snapshots.
</p><p>
Then, I would also have a similar simple one-liner to clean up old
snapshots and monitor that all snapshots are successful.
</p><p>
Keep up the good work!
