Usually I try to write articles that are not aimed at a particular
distribution. Although I may give examples assuming a Debian-based
distribution, whenever possible, I try to make my instructions applicable to
everyone. This is not going to be one of those articles. Here, I
document a process I went through recently with Debian preseeding (a
method of automating a Debian install, like kickstart on Red Hat-based
systems) that I found much more difficult than it needed to be, mostly
because documentation was so sparse. In fact, I really found only two solid
examples to work from in my research, one of which referred to the other.
</p><p>
In this article, I describe how to preseed full-disk encryption in
a Debian install. This problem came up as I was trying to create a
fully automated &ldquo;OEM&rdquo; install for a laptop. The goal was to have an
automated boot mode that would guide users through their OS install and
use full-disk encryption by default, but would make the process as simple
as possible for users. Normally, unless you are going to encrypt the
entire disk as one big partition, the Debian installer makes you jump
through a few hoops to set up disk encryption during an install. 
</p><p>
In my case, I couldn't just use the full disk, because I needed to carve off
a small section of the disk as a rescue partition to store the OEM install
image itself. My end goal was to make it so users just had to enter
their passphrase, and it would set up an unencrypted /boot and rescue disk
partition and an encrypted / and swap. As an additional challenge, I also
wanted to skip the time-consuming disk-erasing process that typically
happens when you enable disk encryption with Debian, since the disk was
going to be blank to start with anyway.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, although there is a lot of documentation on how to automate
ordinary partitioning and LVM with preseeding (I actually wrote a whole
section on the topic myself in one of my books), I had a hard time finding
much documentation on how to add encryption to the mix. After a lot of
research, I finally found two posts (and as I mentioned, one of them referenced the other) that
described the magic incantation that would enable this. Unfortunately, the
only supported mode for encrypted disks in Debian preseed requires the use
of LVM (something I confirmed later when I read the source code responsible
for this part of the install). That's not the end of the world, but it would
have been simpler in my mind if it didn't have that requirement.
</p><p>
Since you need a basic unencrypted /boot partition to load a kernel and
prompt the user for a passphrase, I had to account for both and
preserve a small 2GB rescue disk partition that already was present on the
disk. After that, the remaining / and swap partitions were encrypted. Here
is the partition section of the preseed config:

If you've never worked with preseeding, this entire section of code
probably looks incredibly foreign. As preseeding in general is documented
well in a number of other places, I'm not going to bother breaking down
every setting here. Instead, let me highlight the settings that matter
for disk encryption. The most important one tells partman (the preseed
partition manager) to use encryption:

<pre     class="programlisting">
d-i partman-auto/method string crypto
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, because preseeded encrypted partitions need to use LVM, I must add
LVM-specific preseed settings:

<pre     class="programlisting">
d-i partman-lvm/device_remove_lvm boolean true
d-i partman-lvm/confirm boolean true
d-i partman-auto-lvm/guided_size string max
d-i partman-auto-lvm/new_vg_name string crypt
</pre>
</p><p>
In the last of these settings, I told partman to create a new LVM volume
group named <tt  >crypt</tt> that I will use to store my encrypted partitions.
Further down when I define my swap and root partitions, you can see where I
defined the logical volumes by name and set what volume group they are in:

<pre     class="programlisting">
2000 2000 2000 linux-swap                       \
        $lvmok{ } lv_name{ swap }               \
        in_vg { crypt }                         \
. . .
500 10000 1000000000 ext4                       \
        $lvmok{ } lv_name{ root }               \
        in_vg { crypt }                         \
</pre>
</p><p>
Once these settings were in place, I was able to preseed an install and have
disk encryption be almost fully automated, except that the installer
prompted me for a passphrase, which I wanted. 
</p><p>
The only missing piece to this automation was that the installer started
overwriting the existing disk with random information. Now, there are good
reasons why you may want to do this before setting up disk encryption, but
in this case, the disk was blank beforehand, and I didn't want to wait the
many hours it might take. Try as I might, no options to preseed this feature
away seemed to work. After poring through the partman code to find the
magic option, I finally resorted to patching the partman-crypto script
on the fly in the middle of the install so that it skipped the erase
process:


<pre     class="programlisting">
d-i partman/early_command \
       string sed -i.bak 's/-f $id\/skip_erase/-d $id/g'
/lib/partman/lib/crypto-base.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
This is an ugly hack indeed, but it was the only way I was able to find
that worked. With that in place, I was able have an automated partitioning
recipe with full-disk encryption that skipped the disk-erasing section. My
hope is that the next time other people need to do this and do a search
on-line, they at least can find my article and the two other examples and
won't have to burn so much time.
