Rogue Wave Software's CodeDynamics</h2></div></div><p>
Helped on by a nudge from Rogue Wave Software's CodeDynamics tool, large-scale
data modelling and analytics technologies traditionally reserved for HPC are
making their way into new enterprise and industrial applications. These big data
solutions in financial, energy, science, government and other commercial services
require the same elements as HPC: extremely fast systems, highly optimized code
and innovative algorithms. Enter CodeDynamics, Rogue Wave's next-generation
dynamic analysis tool for data-intensive commercial applications that expands the
reach of multithreaded debugging. CodeDynamics looks at complex C and C++
applications at execution time to help identify and correct bugs, memory issues
and crashes, cutting &ldquo;right to the chase&rdquo; to identifying causes
quickly.
Enterprises that demand performance, scalability and high availability will find
value in the deep thread control, unique reverse debugging and advanced data
visualization features of CodeDynamics, adds Rogue Wave. An additional innovation
in CodeDynamics is the ReplayEngine feature, built to simplify the troubleshooting
process. By recording and saving program execution, ReplayEngine allows developers
to work back from a failure, error or crash to find the root cause without
repetitive restarts and stops, and it allows developers to store the recording to
investigate the error at any time.

IBM's API Harmony</h2></div></div><p>
IBM prefaced the announcement for its new API Harmony platform by stressing not
just the critical importance of APIs for organizations to become more
&ldquo;cognitive&rdquo; but also the value of the &ldquo;API Economy&rdquo;, destined to
be worth $2.2 trillion by 2018. To exploit the vast potential of APIs&mdash;that is,
application programming interfaces&mdash;while navigating their risks, Big Blue
presents API Harmony, a cloud service on the Bluemix Development Platform that
acts as a matchmaker of APIs for developers and IT managers to facilitate the
process of building new applications. Armed with advanced cognitive technologies
like intelligent mapping and graph technology, API Harmony provides a unique
developer experience to anticipate what a developer will require to build new
apps, make recommendations, show API relationships and identify what is
missing. IBM adds that when core information assets are packaged as APIs and
shared or sold, enterprises build awareness, increase customer satisfaction
through more personalized services and expand partner networks. API Harmony is
one of many services and solutions from IBM that provide the foundation for clouds
to behave as one, leading to more consistent cloud integration regardless of
the cloud infrastructure.

JetBrains Toolbox</h2></div></div><p>
In this space, I typically cover about eight new products for your reading pleasure.
This month, however, I feature more than double the normal output, thanks to a
&ldquo;big day&rdquo; of updates from JetBrains s.r.o. The tool developer
simultaneously upgraded the nine elements in its JetBrains Toolbox, thus smashing the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> New Products record for most products announced in a single issue.
These nine elements include IntelliJ IDEA 15 IDE for Java, PhpStorm 10 IDE for
Java, WebStorm 11 IDE for JavaScript, PyCharm 5 IDE for Python, AppCode 3.3 IDE
for Objective-C on Mac OS X, CLion 1.2 cross-platform IDE for C and C++, RubyMine
8 IDE for Ruby and Rails, 0xDBE 1.0 IDE for DBAs and SQL Developers and ReSharper
Ultimate 10 productivity tool for Visual Studio. In addition to the product
improvements for each tool, JetBrains added a new &ldquo;All Products&rdquo; pack that
allows customers to use any of the above products according to their current
needs.

1248's DevicePilot</h2></div></div><p>
Unlike Web or smartphone apps, connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices must be
deployed into the physical world, where lots of things can go wrong. To overcome
physical-world barriers that stand in the way of effective IoT at scale, IoT
specialist 1248 unveiled DevicePilot, a new as-a-service solution for managing the
growing IoT ecosystem. DevicePilot continuously monitors and manages connected
devices over their complete life cycles and presents a simple dashboard showing how
many devices have been deployed, where and by whom, and how many are not working
and why. DevicePilot's automatic asset management, monitoring and lifetime
support enable scaling projects from pilot stage to deployment with thousands or
even millions of devices with universal coverage, from applications as variable as
smart energy to smart homes and cities to transport systems, as well as industrial
monitoring and control. DevicePilot is integrated with the ARM mbed IoT Device
Platform, based on open standards, technology and services to accelerate wider
adoption of IoT systems at scale. The goal of 1248 is to fill one of the few
remaining gaps in the set of services required for successful IoT
deployment&mdash;that is,
in device management.

Undo Software to Deliver Support for 64-bit ARM Devices</h2></div></div><p>
Debugging, asserts Undo Software, is the number one challenge when moving existing
code to new architectures like the 64-bit ARM v8-A. To simplify porting code to the
ARM v8-A, Undo Software Ltd. and ARM have teamed up to produce a portfolio of
advanced Linux and Android reversible debugging tools&mdash;the most recent and notable
of which is the Undo Software's Live Recorder. Live Recorder's new
&ldquo;software-implemented trace&rdquo; debugging technology helps simplify porting
code from alternative hardware architectures by enabling Linux and Android
programs to make a detailed recording of themselves while they are running. The
recording, executed in a highly compressed and efficient way, contains everything
needed for a developer to debug an exact copy of the bug as it occurred in
production. This includes everything a program does, such as every memory access
made and every instruction executed. This information can be used to run and step
their programs backward and forward in time, enabling developers to fix bugs
more quickly. Live Recorder delivers particular benefits to telecoms, IoT,
enterprise server, HPC, mobile and automotive industries, the sectors most
advanced in porting existing software to the 64-bit ARM architecture.
