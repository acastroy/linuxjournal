Although some Web community sites get evil and lock in
the users, Bloglines takes an open approach and lets
you point your own scripts at its Web services API.
Drop in and catch up with your favorite blogs.

I am writing this column a few days after the November 2, 2004,
elections in the United States. As an admitted political junkie,
I enjoy the modern era of computerized, always-on punditry. No longer
must I switch TV stations or read several newspapers at the local
library; now, I can follow the sound bites as they pass from the
candidates to the press to the various partisan sites.
</p><p>
Keeping up with many different news and opinion sites can consume
quite a bit of time. As we have seen over the last few months,
everyone has benefited from the creation of news aggregators&mdash;programs that read the RSS and Atom syndication feeds produced by
Weblogs, newspapers and other frequently updated sites. An
aggregator, as its name suggests, takes these feeds and puts them into
a single, easily accessible listing.
</p><p>
Bloglines.com is an Internet startup that provides a Web-based news
aggregator. In and of itself, this should not surprise anyone; the
combination of syndication, aggregation and the Web made this a
natural idea. And, Bloglines isn't unique; there are other, perhaps
lesser-known, Web-based news aggregators.
</p><p>
One unique service that Bloglines offers its subscribers,
however, is the ability to use Bloglines' internal database to create their
own news aggregators or their own applications built from
the data Bloglines has collected. This information is available
without charge, under a fairly unrestrictive license, to any
programmer interested in harvesting the results of Bloglines' engine.
The fact that Bloglines checks for updates on hundreds of thousands of
blogs and sites approximately every hour means that someone using the
Web services API can be assured of getting the most recent Weblog
content.
</p><p>
Last time [<i  >LJ</i>, January 2005], we looked at the Notifier API, which provides access to a
particular user's available-but-unread feeds. We also discussed the
Blogroll API, which allows users to determine and use programmatically,
if they wish, a list of people who are pointing to a feed. As we saw, these APIs made it
easy for us to find out that new Weblog entries were
available or to create our own custom aggregation page listing
Weblogs of interest.
</p><p>
Something was missing in the functionality that we exposed in that
article,
however. It's nice to know that new Weblog entries are among my Bloglines
subscriptions, but it would be even nicer to know which blogs had been
updated. And, it's nice to get a list
of my current subscriptions, but I would be much happier to find out
which of them have been updated&mdash;and to find out when they were most
recently updated, how many new entries are in each Weblog and
what those entries contain. In other words, I want to be able to
replace the current Bloglines interface with one of my own, displaying
new Weblog entries in a format that isn't dictated by the
Bloglines.com Web site.
</p><p>
Luckily, the Web services developers at Bloglines have made it
possible to do exactly this by way of the sync API. This month, we
continue our exploration of Bloglines Web services, looking in detail
at the sync API it provides. We also are going to create a simple news
aggregator of our own, providing some of the same features as the
Bloglines interface.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14e0580.0x15d8768"></a>
Subscriptions and Items</h2></div></div><p>
At the end of the day, a news aggregator such as Bloglines simply is a
list of URLs. Indeed, the Python-based news aggregator we
created two months ago using the Universal Feed Parser was precisely
such a program&mdash;it looked at a set of URLs in a file and retrieved
the most recent items associated with those URLs. Each individual
Weblog posting must be associated with one of the URLs on a list.
Removing a URL from the subscription lists makes its associated
postings irrelevant to that user and invisible to them.
</p><p>
The fact that Bloglines has multiple users rather than a single user
means it must keep track of not only a set of different URLs, but
also which URL is associated with each user. Although this obviously
complicates things somewhat, modern high-level
languages make the difference between these two data structures easily
understood. Rather than simply storing a list of URLs, we must create
a hash table, in which the key is a user ID and the value is the list
associated with that particular user. Once we have the user's unique
ID, we easily can keep track of that particular user's subscriptions.
</p><p>
Of course, Bloglines is keeping track of subscriptions not for a
few thousand users, but for many tens or hundreds of thousands of
users. Thus, it is safe to assume they are not using such a naive
implementation, which would suffice for a small experiment or an
aggregator designed for a small number of people. Things get a
bit trickier when you approach Bloglines' user load. Each user's list
of subscriptions can't be a simple URL; it is more likely to be an ID number
(or primary key, in database jargon) associated with a URL. Such a system gives multiple
participants the chance to subscribe to a site's syndication feed and
allows Bloglines to suggest new Weblogs that they might enjoy,
based on their current subscriptions.
</p><p>
It thus should come as no surprise to learn that retrieving new Weblog
postings from Bloglines is a two-step process, with the first step
requiring us to retrieve a list of subscriptions. That is, we
first ask Bloglines for a list of subscription IDs associated with a
user. We then ask Bloglines to send us all of the new items for
this user and this subscription ID.
</p><p>
Implementations of the Bloglines Web services API are available in several
different languages. Because Perl is my default language for creating
new applications, I am going to use the WebService::Bloglines module that has
been uploaded to CPAN, the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, a
worldwide collection of Web and FTP servers from which Perl and its
modules can be retrieved. For example, Listing 1 contains a simple
program (bloglines-listsubs.pl) that displays the title,
subscription ID and URL for each of a user's subscriptions. A number
of additional values are available for each of the subscriptions; the
documentation for WebService::Bloglines, as well as the Bloglines API
documentation, lists these in detail.

    }
}

    print "No subscriptions.\n"
}

</pre></div><p>
If you are interested in preserving the subscription hierarchy
the Bloglines.com interface gives users, you might want to examine the
folders function, rather than the feed function used in Listing 1.
Although feed returns a flat list of subscriptions, folders keeps
things organized as they exist on the Bloglines site.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14e0580.0x15d8be0"></a>
Getting Items within a Subscription</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we know how to retrieve the subscription IDs associated with
a particular Bloglines user, we can retrieve individual items
associated with a particular subscription ID. For example, Listing 2
is a short program that retrieves all of a user's subscriptions and
then displays all of the newly updated items for each. The
output is in plain-text format, not in HTML, which means the
displayed link is not clickable. But, it would not be particularly
difficult to run such a program in a cron job and dump its output into
an HTML file, thereby giving an up-to-the-minute personalized list of
feeds. Of course, Bloglines provides such a service at no cost
whenever you might want to check its Web site. So, although such a
program is an interesting use of the Bloglines Web services, it
doesn't have a compelling use outside of those services.

</pre></div><p>
One of the clever things that Bloglines has done in its Web services
definition is to use HTTP return codes to indicate errors and unusual
circumstances. For example, the 200 (OK) response code indicates that
new items may be read and that getitems($subId) contains one or more
such data structures. The 304 (unchanged)
response code, which normally indicates a page of HTML has not
changed since it last was requested, here has a slightly different
function; it indicates that a particular subscriber already has seen all
of the available items for this subscription. Other response codes
(401, 403 and 410) indicate authentication errors and probably mean
that the requesting user has made a mistake in typing the Bloglines
user name, password or both.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, Perl's handling of such response codes is less than
optimal. In order to handle them, we must invoke
<tt  >$bloglines-&gt;getitems()</tt> inside of an eval block
and check for a non-empty value of $@ immediately after the eval. If $@ is empty,
we can assume that we received a 200 (OK) HTTP response code and
there are new items to read. But if it contains a value, we then can
rewrite the output message, as we did in Listing 2 . If
we fail to trap this method call within an eval block, however, our
program will die with a fatal runtime error the first
time we receive anything other than a 200 response code.
</p><p>
Finally, two optional parameters make the Bloglines
functionality complete. The first, known as n, is a simple
true-or-false (1 or 0) value that tells Bloglines if it should update
the already-seen bit for the articles it is sending to you.
Normally, when a user is viewing Weblog postings with the Bloglines.com
Web interface, this is set to 1, meaning you do not see any
already-seen articles a second time. Perhaps because they knew
the Web services API currently supplements other news aggregation
applications, Bloglines wisely changed the default to 0 in this API.
</p><p>
The second optional parameter, known as d, tells Bloglines the first
date from which you would like to download a particular site's
postings. The value is in UNIX time format, meaning that you send the
number of seconds since January 1, 1970. This number is readily
available with the time function in most major languages, and it allows
you to indicate with great precision exactly how far back you want to
delve into a particular site's history, as stored by Bloglines.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
To be honest, I am an enthusiastic Bloglines user without being sure
exactly where the site and company are headed. I cannot imagine that it
will continue to be free of charge and of any advertising
indefinitely, unless its investors are highly charitable or extremely
naive. I enjoy its fine interface, the fact that I easily can access
the Weblogs on which I have depended for political insight&mdash;or
screaming, depending on how you interpret such punditry&mdash;and its
speedy, robust functionality.
</p><p>
But as Amazon, eBay and Google have demonstrated over the last few
years, providing a Web services interface to your core data opens the
door to many new creative applications that a company's internal
developers never think to create. Bloglines is only beginning to
expose its functionality with Web services, and although it has taken
only an initial and tentative step in this direction, what I have seen
appears to be promising. I look forward to seeing applications
that will be built on top of this API, as well as the additional APIs
that Bloglines and its competitors will offer in an attempt to make
Bloglines the central site for Weblogs, readers and developers
alike.
