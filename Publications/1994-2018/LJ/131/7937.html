From zero to Web-based database application in eight easy steps.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2928580.0x2a20348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The LAMP combination of Linux, Apache, MySQL and a programming
technology (typically Perl, Python or PHP) is a powerful one.
Once you've built one Web-based database application, however, you've
built them all. From a programmer's perspective, things become boring and
repetitive pretty quickly.
</p><p>
I recently worked on my first Web application. I built it on Linux, of
course, running through Apache and talking to MySQL. I used Perl as my glue
language, with CGI figuring heavily. I created all the code to talk to
a MySQL table, adding/editing/updating as need be. And it all worked,
which was good. What was bad was, I was faced with repeating this
activity (and effort) for each of the remaining tables in my database. In
a time-honoured tradition among Perl programmers, I started to look for
ways to be constructively lazy. There had to be a better way. After a
few false starts and some searching, I found Maypole.
</p><p>
Initially created by Simon Cozens and maintained by Sebastian
Riedel, Maypole is a rapid application development framework for
Web applications. Maypole's home page promised a fully functioning
application in about
20 lines of Perl code. This sounded too good not to try.
</p><p>
Having tried Maypole, I can confirm that Simon and Sebastian are not
lying. Only a handful of lines of code is required to build a very
functional application. Some setup is required,
but&mdash;critically&mdash;this activity is not programming. Once the setup is complete,
any number of applications can be created, each with a handful of lines of
code. In the rest of this article, I step you through building an
application with Maypole.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2928580.0x2a20558"></a>
Step 1: Install Linux (If Needed)</h2></div></div><p>
This step used to require an entire article to describe. Today, a single
sentence summarizes. Pick your favourite distribution, and install it.
</p><p>
Having recently taken delivery of a new PC, I grabbed Fedora Core 3 and custom
installed everything. If you don't have this luxury, be sure to install
the following packages from your chosen distribution: httpd,
httpd-devel, mod_perl, mod_perl-devel, mysql
(client and server) and Perl.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2928580.0x2a206b8"></a>
Step 2: Prepare Your Apache/mod_perl Environment</h2></div></div><p>
Increasingly, modern distributions are shipping with release 2 of
Apache and version 1.99 of mod_perl, as opposed to the entrenched
1.3.x release of Apache. Thankfully, Maypole can work with either release
of Apache and also can be configured to use CGI (if mod_perl
is not available). My Fedora installation shipped with release 2.0.52 of
Apache and 1.99_16-3 of mod_perl, so that's what I use here.
Users on the Maypole mailing list have reported successful
installations on the vast majority of Linux platforms, including SuSE,
Debian and Red Hat. Maypole also can be installed on Apple's Mac OS X
and, with some extra effort, Microsoft's Windows.
</p><p>
As root, I edited Fedora's Apache configuration file at
/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf and commented out the ServerTokens
directive. I then arranged to start Apache automatically at boot time,
and fired up the Web server using these commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chkconfig httpd on
service httpd start
</pre>
</p><p>
The lynx text-based browser can be used to check the status of
the server with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
lynx -head -dump http://localhost/
</pre>
</p><p>
The results confirm that Apache and mod_perl are up and running,
as shown on the third line of this output:

<pre     class="programlisting">
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Date: Wed, 17 Nov 2004 23:30:01 GMT
Server: Apache/2.0.52 (Fedora)
            mod_perl/1.99_16 Perl/v5.8.5 DAV/2
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 3931
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
</pre>
</p><p>
Happy that all was okay, I re-edited httpd.conf and uncommented
the ServerTokens directive, as it is best not to give away too much
about the internals of your Web server to potential attackers. While in
httpd.conf, I changed the ServerAdmin directive to a more
appropriate e-mail address, then set ServerName to the DNS name for
my server. I also made a note of the value set for DocumentRoot,
which was /var/www/html on my machine.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2928580.0x2a20a28"></a>
Step 3: Prepare MySQL</h2></div></div><p>
Depending on the distribution you are running, MySQL already may be
installed. If MySQL is missing, download it from your distribution's
download area, or go to the MySQL Web site. On my Fedora machine, I issued the
usual commands to prepare MySQL for use, while logged in as root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chkconfig mysqld on
service mysqld start
</pre>
</p><p>
With MySQL running, I then set the MySQL administrator password:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mysqladmin -u root password 'passwordhere'
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2928580.0x2a20c38"></a>
Step 4: Install Maypole</h2></div></div><p>
Maypole interacts directly with Apache through mod_perl. To work
with Apache 2, a development library called libapreq2 needs to be
fetched from the CPAN repository and installed into Perl. I downloaded
libapreq2-2.04_03-dev.tar.gz from CPAN. Prior to installing the
library, I upgraded the ExtUtils::XSBuilder module that ships with
Perl. A single command, issued as root, suffices:

<pre     class="programlisting">
perl -MCPAN -e "install ExtUtils::XSBuilder"
</pre>
</p><p>
If this is the first time the CPAN shell has executed, you'll be prompted
to configure the local CPAN module. Be sure to select follow when
asked about fetching prerequisite modules. With the module upgraded, I
installed the libapreq2 library with the usual set of Perl module
installation commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">

tar zxvf libapreq2-2.04_03-dev.tar.gz
cd libapreq2-2.04-dev/
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
su
make install
&lt;Ctrl-D&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The actual installation of Maypole starts by invoking the CPAN shell
as root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
perl -MCPAN -e "shell"
</pre>
</p><p>
As Maypole depends on a large collection of prerequisite CPAN modules,
installation can take a while. Prior to actually asking the CPAN shell
to install Maypole for you, issue the following commands to ensure that some
of the more troublesome modules are dealt with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cpan&gt; install CGI::Untaint::date
cpan&gt; force install Class::DBI::mysql
</pre>
</p><p>
I had to force the installation of Class::DBI::mysql
as a number of tests failed, effectively aborting the automatic
installation. By forcing the install, the broken tests are ignored,
allowing the install to proceed. With the prerequisites dealt with,
install Maypole with this CPAN command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cpan&gt; install Maypole
</pre>
</p><p>
A series of automated interactions with the CPAN repository
begin after this step. Keep an eye on what's going on, because at certain points,
you have to respond to some self-explanatory prompts. When all was
done and dusted, the most recent release of Maypole&mdash;2.04 at the time
of this writing&mdash;was installed on my machine.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2928580.0x2a210b0"></a>
Step 5: Create a Database and Some Tables</h2></div></div><p>
Returning to MySQL, I logged in as administrator and issued these commands
to remove any default accounts:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mysql -u root -p

mysql&gt; use mysql;
mysql&gt; delete from user where User = '';
mysql&gt; flush privileges;
</pre>
</p><p>
I then created a new database, together with a user to act as owner of
the data:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mysql&gt; create database CLUB;
mysql&gt; grant all on CLUB.* to manager identified
           by 'passwordhere';
mysql&gt; quit
</pre>
</p><p>
These commands create the database, called CLUB, and add a
user, called manager, to the database system. For the purposes of
this article, this simple application manages data about an under-age soccer
club. In addition to storing personal details about each player, the
system maintains data on which players are in which squads, as well as
any medical conditions players may have.
</p><p>
Here are the SQL files that I used to define the tables used within
the CLUB database. The first file, create_player.sql, creates the
player table:

<pre     class="programlisting">
create table player
(
    id                 int not null auto_increment
                           primary key,
    name               varchar (64) not null,
    date_of_birth      date,
    address            varchar (255),
    contact_tel_no     varchar (64),
    squad              int,
    medical_condition  int
);
</pre>
</p><p>
The second file, create_squad.sql, creates the initial list
of squads:

<pre     class="programlisting">
create table squad
(
    id    int not null auto_increment primary key,
    name  varchar (32) not null
);

insert into squad (name) values ('--');
insert into squad (name) values ('Under 8');
insert into squad (name) values ('Under 9');
insert into squad (name) values ('Under 10');
insert into squad (name) values ('Under 11');
insert into squad (name) values ('Under 12');
</pre>
</p><p>
The squad table is initialized to a reasonable set of default
values. The third and final file, create_condition.sql, creates
a list of possible medical conditions:

<pre     class="programlisting">
create table condition
(
    id    int not null auto_increment primary key,
    name  varchar (64) not null
);

insert into condition (name) values ('--');
insert into condition (name) values ('Asthma');
insert into condition (name) values ('Epilepsy');
</pre>
</p><p>
As with the squad table, the condition table is initialized
with some default data. The data item in the squad and
condition tables is called name. The significance of this point
will be returned to later in this article.
</p><p>
Use the SQL files to create the tables within the database:

<pre     class="programlisting">

mysql -u manager -p CLUB &lt; create_player.sql
mysql -u manager -p CLUB &lt; create_squad.sql
mysql -u manager -p CLUB &lt; create_condition.sql

</pre>
</p><p>
As can be guessed, the CLUB database maintains data on players. Players
belong to a squad and may have a medical condition.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2928580.0x2a21688"></a>
Step 6: Set Up Your Application</h2></div></div><p>
With the database ready and Maypole installed, it's time to configure
the application. A directive needs to be added into the Apache
httpd.conf configuration file to set up a mod_perl handler
for the Maypole application. I added the following to the end of the
configuration file:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;Location /Club&gt;
    SetHandler perl-script
    PerlHandler ClubDB
&lt;/Location&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
These lines tell Apache that when a request is made for the /Club
URL, it is to be handed off to the ClubDB Perl script, which we
write in the next step. Use the following commands, as root, to set up
the URL location:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir /var/www/html/Club
cd /var/www/html/Club
cp -r ~/.cpan/build/Maypole-2.04/templates/* .
cp maypole.css ../club.css
</pre>
</p><p>
Having first created a directory to contain my application's URL
underneath Apache's root directory, I then copied the default templates
that ship with Maypole into this location. I also copied Maypole's CSS
file into my Web server's DocumentRoot, giving it a name that
corresponds to my application.
</p><p>
One final setup activity involves creating a configuration file within
Apache's /etc/httpd/conf directory to hold the application's
MySQL user ID and password. Called ClubDB.conf, this file contains
these lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[client]
user=manager
password=passwordhere
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2928580.0x2a219a0"></a>
Step 7: Write Your 18 Lines of Code</h2></div></div><p>
The code for the Soccer Club Database resides in the ClubDB.pm
file. Every Maypole application starts with a package statement declaring
a Perl namespace. Strictness is turned on, then the base Maypole module,
called Apache::MVC, is used:

<pre     class="programlisting">
package ClubDB;

use strict;

use base 'Apache::MVC';
</pre>
</p><p>
The code then establishes a connection to the database, using the user ID
and password from the named configuration file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ClubDB-&gt;setup( "dbi:mysql:CLUB;
    mysql_read_default_file=
        /etc/httpd/conf/ClubDB.conf" );
</pre>
</p><p>
A few more lines of code inform Maypole of the base Web address for the
application, as well as a list of tables in the database to which to
provide access. For this simple application, it makes sense to provide access to all
the tables:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ClubDB-&gt;config-&gt;{uri_base} =
    "http://webmason.itcarlow.ie/Club/";

ClubDB-&gt;config-&gt;{display_tables} =
    [ qw[ player squad condition ] ];
</pre>
</p><p>
When it comes to squads, my application allows the user to view, edit or delete
squad names. Specifying this takes a couple of lines of code, one of
which sets up another namespace:

<pre     class="programlisting">
package ClubDB::Squad;

sub display_columns{ "name" };

ClubDB::Player-&gt;untaint_columns(
    printable =&gt; [ "name" ] );
</pre>
</p><p>
The untaint_columns method identifies the type of data expected in
the column, as well as indicates to Maypole that the column can be edited
using the Web interface. Medical conditions are handled in the same way:

<pre     class="programlisting">
package ClubDB::Condition;

sub display_columns{ "name" };

ClubDB::Condition-&gt;untaint_columns(
    printable =&gt; [ "name" ] );
</pre>
</p><p>
The code for the player table is more complex but not by
much. After declaring another namespace, two calls to the has_a
method establish the links between the player table and the
others. The link is specified in terms of only the declared
namespaces:

<pre     class="programlisting">
package ClubDB::Player;

ClubDB::Player-&gt;has_a(
    squad =&gt; "ClubDB::Squad" );

ClubDB::Player-&gt;has_a(
    medical_condition =&gt; "ClubDB::Condition" );
</pre>
</p><p>
For players, we list the columns to display using the
display_columns method. Doing so allows the programmer to
control the order in which the columns appear within the Web interface. If
display_columns is not used, Maypole displays the columns in
alphabetical order, which may not always suit your needs. The invocation of
untaint_columns identifies the types of data that can be edited
within each of the columns. The code concludes with Perl's familiar
1;, which is required of all Perl modules:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sub display_columns{ qw( name address
    date_of_birth contact_tel_no
        squad medical_condition ) };

ClubDB::Player-&gt;untaint_columns(
    integer   =&gt;
        [ "squad", "medical_condition" ],
    printable =&gt;
        [ "name", "address", "contact_tel_no" ],
    date      =&gt;
        [ "date_of_birth" ] );

1;
</pre>
</p><p>
Count the semicolons. Bearing in mind that the presented code has
been formatted to fit the printed page, there are only 18 lines of code
in all. All that's left to do is copy the Perl module into a location
where Apache and mod_perl can find it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir -p /etc/httpd/lib/perl/
cp ClubDB.pm /etc/httpd/lib/perl/
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2928580.0x2a18860"></a>
Step 8: Give It a Go!</h2></div></div><p>
Restart Apache before accessing the Maypole application:

<pre     class="programlisting">
service httpd restart
</pre>
</p><p>
I entered http://webmason.itcarlow.ie/Club/ into the Firefox
location bar, and up popped Figure 1, which, although
something, was not quite what I was expecting.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7937f1.large.jpg"><img src="7937f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Default Maypole Opening Screen
</p></div></div><p>
For starters, I was expecting to see some nice CSS output, not the plain HTML
I was seeing. To fix this problem, I explored the default template
files copied into the Web server during Step 6. By changing these, it
is possible to alter the appearance of the application, without changing the
source code to the application. The significance of that last sentence
cannot be overstated. In essence, the way the application looks is controlled
by the CSS templates. The way the application behaves is controlled by the
code. The data used by the application is controlled by MySQL. All of this
separation of duties makes for a very productive development environment,
as changing one part of the application shouldn't adversely affect either of
the others.
</p><p>
The templates live within a subdirectory called factory, located
beneath the URL of the application, which is Club/ in this case. The
factory templates are the Maypole defaults and are used
unless overriding templates are found within another directory, called
custom.
</p><p>
After creating the custom directory underneath the Club/ URL,
I copied the header file from factory to custom and
edited it with vi. I changed /maypole.css to read /club.css,
in addition to replacing the &ldquo;A poorly configured&rdquo; message with a
more appropriate description of the application. I also copied the
frontpage file from factory to custom and edited it
to use a better application description. Then, I changed the anchor tag
within custom/frontpage to read &ldquo;Work with the player data&rdquo; as
opposed to the default &ldquo;List by player&rdquo; text. With these changes made,
I clicked the Reload button within Firefox, resulting in Figure 2,
which&mdash;I think you'll agree&mdash;looks a whole lot better.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7937f2.large.jpg"><img src="7937f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Customized Soccer Club Opening Screen
</p></div></div><p>
Clicking on any of the menu options produces a beautifully formatted
input screen, like those shown in Figures 3 and 4.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7937f3.large.jpg"><img src="7937f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The Maypole Front End to the Squad Table
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7937f4.large.jpg"><img src="7937f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The Maypole Front End to the Player Table
</p></div></div><p>
Figure 4 shows the display after the entry of two fictitious players.
Notice all the functionality provided for free. Tabs for each
of the tables are located along the top of the display. Simply click on the tab to
display that table's data. Each row of data has an associated edit and
delete button. Click on any column heading to sort the display on the
data in that column. Perform a search using the provided search form. Add
more players using the add form. Notice the drop-down menus for the player's
squad and medical condition. Click on the field and a drop-down box
appears with the choices available to you. This bit of magic occurs
because Maypole has been told that each player &ldquo;has a&rdquo; squad and
&ldquo;has a&rdquo; condition. By default, Maypole uses the name data column in
the referred to table to provide the data to these drop-down boxes.
</p><p>
And, that's it&mdash;a fully functioning Web interface to an underlying
database, in eight easy steps.
</p><p>
Despite the fact that Maypole is quite new, an active community
already has gathered around it. The mailing list recently split, one for
developers and the other for users, and the Maypole Web site is now hosted
by perl.org.
</p><p>
As I hope I've demonstrated, Maypole&mdash;once set up&mdash;is a breeze
to use. Most of the guts of any Web application is provided for free. Adding
additional functionality also is possible. Maypole is not stuck on
MySQL either, as any SQL DBMS can be used. Refer to the articles and
documentation referenced on the Maypole site for more details.
