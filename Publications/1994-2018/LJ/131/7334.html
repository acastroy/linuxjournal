Authorization is the process of deciding if entity X is allowed to have
access to resource Y. Determining the identity of X is the job of the
authentication process.
One task of authorization in computer networks is to define and determine
which user has access to which computers in the network. A simple example
would be one line in a computer's /etc/passwd file,
<tt  >joe:X:1234:56:/home/joe:/bin/bash</tt>,
to allow user joe access to this computer. If you want to give user
joe access to several computers, you have to add this line to every
computer's /etc/passwd file.
</p><p>
On Linux, the tendency exists to create a local account for each single
user who should be allowed to log in to a computer. This typically
is the case, because a user needs not only login privileges
but also access to additional resources, such as a home directory to do some
work. Creating a local account on every computer takes care of all this.
</p><p>
The problem with this local account approach is that these accounts can be
inconsistent with one another. The same user name could have a different
user ID and/or group ID on different computers. Even more problematic
is when two different accounts share the same user ID and group ID on
different computers. User joe on computer1 could have user ID 1234 and
group ID 56, and user jane on computer2 could have the same user ID 1234
and group ID 56. This is a big security risk in cases where shared resources
are used. These two different accounts are the same for an NFS
server, so these users can wipe out each other's files.
</p><p>
The solution to this inconsistency problem is to have
only one central, authoritative data source for this
kind of information and a means of providing all your
computers with access to this central source. This is
what a directory service does. The two directory services
most widely used for centralizing authorization data
are the network information service (NIS, formerly
known as yellow pages or YP) and lightweight directory
access protocol (LDAP).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb4a580.0xc42500"></a>
NIS vs. LDAP</h2></div></div><p>
A few things need to be considered when it comes to deciding which
directory service to use, NIS or LDAP.
If your company already maintains an LDAP server, it seems simple enough
to add the authorization data to it. However, usually company LDAP servers
are used for white pages and similar fairly lightweight tasks. Adding the
authorization task puts a significant load on an LDAP server, because
every single lookup for user name, UID, GID and so on done by programs needs
to be answered by it. It usually makes sense to add an additional LDAP
server dedicated solely to authorization. Also, due to the many different kinds
of directory queries, it is rather hard to get the performance tuning
right. You need to add all necessary LDAP index definitions in your
slapd.conf file in order to speed up common lookups, but you don't want
to add too many index definitions. Doing so makes the LDAP back-end
database files large, and everything slows down again.
</p><p>
LDAP is the better choice in networks that have problems with many
dropped UDP packets, because it uses TCP/IP where retransmits are built
into the network protocol layer.
NIS, on the other hand, uses remote procedure
calls (RPCs) over UDP. Every dropped packet results in a non-answered
NIS query, and the NIS client needs to repeat the query. Use the command
<tt  >netstat -s -u</tt> at different times on different machines on your network
to see whether your network suffers from this problem. You should see
very few errors reported by this command.
</p><p>
I concentrate on NIS in this article, because it
is easier to start out with and there is a fairly
simple migration path to LDAP in case you see
problems. PADL Software Pty, Ltd., provides a set of
open-source tools to help you convert all your
NIS data files to LDAP (see the on-line Resources). You still
have to do the performance-tuning part, however. You
have to write migration tools yourself if you want
to migrate from LDAP to NIS.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb4a580.0xc42710"></a>
Configuring the NIS Servers</h2></div></div><p>
An NIS server does not require a lot of hardware resources. Any machine
you have around should do the job. You might want to put this new
functionality on a dedicated machine, though. At the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC), we serve, without
any problems, up to 500 Linux and Solaris clients with one old Sun Netra
T1 server.
We have four of these NIS servers for about 700 Solaris and
Linux desktop computers and another six NIS servers for about 2,500 Solaris
and Linux compute servers. Our clients are spread out somewhat unevenly
over the servers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb4a580.0xc42818"></a>
Master Server Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Log on to the machine where you want to install your master NIS server, and
make sure the latest portmap, ypserv and yp-tools RPMs are installed. If
not, download and install them now.
All following commands have to be issued as root.
Start the portmapper d&aelig;mon with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# service portmap start
</pre>
</p><p>
The next step is to define the name of your new NIS domain. This name
can be anything you like, but it probably makes sense to pick one that
represents your department inside your company; nis.example.com
for an NIS domain for all of Example.Com or eng.example.com for the
Engineering department inside of Example.Com would be good choices.
</p><p>
Set the NIS domain name on your master server with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# domainname nis.example.com
</pre>
</p><p>
You also have to add the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
NISDOMAIN=nis.example.com
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb4a580.0xc42b30"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to the file /etc/sysconfig/network.
</p><p>
Restrict access to your new NIS server by creating a file
/var/yp/securenets with the content:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# netmask       # network
255.255.255.0   192.168.0.0
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb4a580.0xc42ce8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This is a crucial security step. The world is able to query your
NIS server if you don't have this file.
</p><p>
The next step is to define the things you would like to put into NIS.
For the purpose of authorization, the /etc/group and /etc/passwd files
as well as something called netgroup are sufficient. However,
many more things are possible. To get an idea, have a look at the file
/var/yp/Makefile on your NIS server.
</p><p>
Below, I show how the three files I've mentioned are configured
to be distributed by way of NIS.
</p><p>
Adjust the Makefile generating the NIS map database files:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cp /var/yp/Makefile /var/yp/Makefile.save
# vi /var/yp/Makefile
</pre>
</p><p>
Change the following two entries from true to false to prevent the merging
of passwd and shadow files as well as group and gshadow files:

<pre     class="programlisting">
MERGE_PASSWD=false
MERGE_GROUP=false
</pre>
</p><p>
Change the directory name where NIS should look for its data sources:

<pre     class="programlisting">
YPSRCDIR = /etc/NIS
YPPWDDIR = /etc/NIS
</pre>
</p><p>
Comment all files from which the NIS databases should not be built.
I left only these three files:

<pre     class="programlisting">
GROUP       = $(YPPWDDIR)/group
PASSWD      = $(YPPWDDIR)/passwd
NETGROUP    = $(YPSRCDIR)/netgroup
</pre>
</p><p>
Comment the line starting with <tt  >all:</tt> that contains the list of all
potential NIS maps. Add the new line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
all:	passwd group netgroup
</pre>
</p><p>
Watch out for TAB characters. In a Makefile, you must use
only TAB characters, not spaces, to indent commands.
</p><p>
Now, create the data source directory defined in the Makefile:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# mkdir /etc/NIS/
# chmod 700 /etc/NIS
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb4a580.0xc43370"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and put a passwd file in there:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# grep -v '^root' /etc/passwd &gt; /etc/NIS/passwd
</pre>
</p><p>
You should remove not only the root account but all system accounts
from this file and leave only the real user accounts.
</p><p>
If you still are using /etc/passwd with encrypted
passwords, it now is time to convert them to Kerberos
5, as described in the previous article [<i  >LJ</i>,
February 2005]. If you don't
do this, your encrypted passwords are exposed
on the network when the passwd file is distributed
to the slave NIS servers or to the NIS clients.
</p><p>
Now, collect the local /etc/passwd files from all the machines that are to
be members of your new NIS domain. Remove all system accounts
and then merge them together with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% cat passwd_1 passwd_2 passwd_3 ... &gt; passwd_merge
</pre>
</p><p>
Remove all duplicate entries with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% sort passwd_merge | uniq &gt; passwd_uniq
</pre>
</p><p>
Check the consistency of the remaining entries with:

<pre     class="programlisting">

% cut -d':' -f1 passwd_uniq | sort | uniq -c | \
egrep -v "\s*1"

</pre>
</p><p>
If this produces any output, you have two different entries with the
same account name. If the difference is not in the UID or GID field,
simply decide on one of the entries and remove the other one. If the
difference is the UID or GID field, you need to resolve this conflict,
which can be rather complex.
</p><p>
Another consistency check is to see whether any two different accounts
have the same UID, which is the case if this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">

% cut -d':' -f3 passwd_uniq | sort | uniq -c | \
egrep -v "\s*1"

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb4a580.0xc438f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
produces any output; the second number in the output is the duplicate
UID. Resolving this conflict again can be rather complex.
Do the same kind of merging and checking for all your /etc/group files.
</p><p>
Copy the resulting files to /etc/NIS/passwd and /etc/NIS/group. I will
return to the netgroup file later. Leave it out for now.
</p><p>
Now, start your master NIS server with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# service ypserv start
</pre>
</p><p>
Initialize the NIS maps with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# /usr/lib/yp/ypinit -m
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb4a580.0xc43bb0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and follow the printed instructions.
</p><p>
In order to have all the NIS maps available to your NIS master server,
you probably want to set up this machine as an NIS client as well. Make
sure this NIS client can bind only to the NIS master as server in
order to prevent circular dependencies when booting all your machines, as
after a power outage.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb4a580.0xc3a5a0"></a>
Slave Server Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
NIS slave servers are NIS clients that redistribute the maps they receive
from the NIS master server to other NIS clients. Make sure the newest
portmap, ypserv, ypbind and yp-tools RPMs are installed on all your slave
server machines. The first step in configuring an NIS slave server is to
configure it as an NIS client. See the next section for how to do this.
</p><p>
Once the NIS client is configured, start it with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# service ypbind start
</pre>
</p><p>
On your NIS master server, add the name of the new NIS slave server to
the file /var/yp/ypservers and run the following commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cd /var/yp
# /usr/lib/yp/makedbm ypservers
/var/yp/nis.example.com/ypservers
</pre>
</p><p>
You also need to change the definition of NOPUSH in the file
/etc/YP/Makefile on your NIS master server from true to false in order
to get updated NIS maps pushed from your master server to your slave
server(s).
</p><p>
Back on your new NIS slave server, initialize the slave server with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# /usr/lib/yp/ypinit -s nismaster
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb4a580.0xc3a910"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where <tt  >nismaster</tt> is the name of your NIS master server. This needs to be
the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) if your DNS returns the FQDN for a
name lookup. Copy the file /var/yp/securenets from your NIS master server
over to the new slave server, and start the new NIS slave server with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# service ypserv start
</pre>
</p><p>
Remember to update your disaster recovery plan to reflect the new
dependency of your NIS slave server on your NIS master server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb4a580.0xc3ab20"></a>
Client Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Install the latest ypbind, yp-tools and portmap RPMs on all your clients.
Edit the file /etc/yp.conf to tell the client about your NIS server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ypserver nismaster.example.com
</pre>
</p><p>
Add a line for each of your slave servers as well, if you have some.
Use a random order for these servers on your clients to get somewhat
even load balancing over all available servers.
</p><p>
Add a line to /etc/sysconfig/network to define the NIS domain of the
client:


<pre     class="programlisting">
NISDOMAIN=nis.example.com
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb4a580.0xc3ad88"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and set the NIS domainname with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# domainname nis.example.com
</pre>
</p><p>
Start the portmapper with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# service portmap start
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb4a580.0xc3af98"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and the NIS client with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# service ypbind start
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb4a580.0xc3b0f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
on each client.
</p><p>
The command <tt  >ypwhich</tt>
should now output the NIS server to which this client has bound.
</p><p>
Use the <tt  >ypcat</tt> command to check the content of your
NIS maps. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% ypcat passwd
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, you have to tell all lookups on your client to use
NIS. This is done in the name service switch configuration file
/etc/nsswitch.conf(5). Change the passwd, group and netgroup entries to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
passwd:       compat
group:        files nis
netgroup:     nis
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb4a580.0xc3b468"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This defines the search order for group lookups: start with the local
/etc/group file and then try an NIS lookup. Netgroups come only from NIS. I
return to the compat entry for passwd later.
</p><p>
The name service caching d&aelig;mon nscd(8) sometimes has problems
updating its internal cache. The effect is that changes in an NIS map are
not visible on a particular client. Restarting nscd on that machine is
the only solution to this problem.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb4a580.0xc3b5c8"></a>
Typical Usages</h2></div></div><p>
Two commands you should be familiar with to query information from NIS
are ypcat(1) and ypmatch(1).
<tt  >ypcat</tt> prints values of all keys in an NIS map.
The command <tt  >ypcat passwd</tt>
prints all entries in your NIS passwd map.
<tt  >ypmatch</tt> prints the values of one or more keys from an NIS map;
<tt  >ypmatch jane passwd</tt>
outputs the passwd entry for account jane.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb4a580.0xc3b830"></a>
NIS Group Map</h2></div></div><p>
A typical use of the NIS group map is to allow file sharing between
multiple users. This works with local files as well as with files in
NFS. Here is how to set it up. Let's say you have two users (this
technique works for any number of users) with the following passwd
map entries:

<pre     class="programlisting">
jane:*:1234:42:Jane:/home/jane:/bin/bash
joe:*:5678:57:Joe:/home/joe:/bin/bash
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb4a580.0xc3b990"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This defines the <span   class="emphasis"><em>primary</em></span> group IDs for jane to be 42
and for joe to be 57.
</p><p>
With the NIS group map you can add additional,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>secondary</em></span> group
memberships for accounts. The group entry:

<pre     class="programlisting">
projectX:*:127:jane,joe
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb4a580.0xc3bbf8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
defines a new group projectX with no password (*), group ID 127 and
two members. No comments are allowed in the group file.
</p><p>
If you now set up a directory with read/write/execute permissions for
group projectX:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# mkdir /projects/X/
# chgrp projectX /projects/X/
# chmod g+wrx /projects/X/
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb4a580.0xc3bdb0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
every member in the projectX group has permission to read/write/execute
files inside that file space. The user might need to do a <tt  >newgrp
projectX</tt> first.
</p><p>
Whenever you need to add or remove accounts to or from the group map,
do it on your NIS master server by editing the /etc/NIS/group file and
executing the commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% cd /var/yp
% sudo make group
</pre>
</p><p>
These generate a new group map that makes the changes visible
instantaneously on all clients. There is no need to touch any client to
make these changes. Everything now is centralized in one place on your
NIS master server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb4a580.0xc3c018"></a>
NIS Netgroups</h2></div></div><p>
Netgroups are very different from groups. Netgroups come in two flavors,
user netgroups and host netgroups. Both types of netgroups can contain
netgroups as members, so netgroup definitions can be hierarchical.
Both types of netgroups are defined in the same netgroup file. Comments
are allowed in the netgroup file.
</p><p>
Host netgroup definitions in /etc/NIS/netgroup look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# Group of project groups:
projects \
      projectA \
      projectB \
      projectX

# Group of hosts for Project X
projectX \
        (host1.example.com,-,) \
        (host2.example.com,-,) \
        (host3.example.com,-,)
</pre>
</p><p>
These host netgroup definitions now allow you to,
for example, export NFS space only to subsets of your
machines. In your NFS server's /etc/exports file, you
can use constructs like these:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# export the /projects directory to all machines
# in the "projects" netgroup
/projects    @projects(rw,root_squash)

# export Project X' space only to machines
# in the "projectX" netgroup
/projects/X           @projectX(rw,root_squash)
</pre>
</p><p>
Again, adding or removing hosts or adding/deleting netgroups is a simple
edit of the /etc/NIS/netgroup file on your NIS master server. Execute
<tt  >cd /var/yp; sudo make netgroup</tt> to update the NIS
map, and the changes
are visible everywhere instantly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb4a580.0xc3c330"></a>
User Netgroups</h2></div></div><p>
User netgroups, which are netgroups with accounts as members, typically
are used to restrict login to computers.
User netgroup definitions look slightly different from host netgroup
definitions:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# Group of project user groups
u-projects \
        u-projectA \
        u-projectB \
        u-projectX

# Group of users in Project X
u-projectX \
        (-,jane,) \
        (-,joe,) \
        (-,nick,)
</pre>
</p><p>
The prefix u- in the names is a convention to distinguish user
netgroups from host netgroups.
</p><p>
With these definitions in place, you now can grant or restrict login
access to your computers with these kinds of entries in a machine's
local /etc/passwd file. Remove a + at the very end of the passwd files
if present:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Allow access for all accounts in the u-projects netgroup and no
one else:

<pre     class="programlisting">
+@u-projects
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
Allow access for only the u-projectX netgroup members and no one else:

<pre     class="programlisting">
+@u-projectX
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
Allow access to everybody in u-projects but not in u-projectX:

<pre     class="programlisting">
-@u-projectX
+@u-projects
</pre>
</p><p>
Order here is important. The first match determines what
happens.
</p></li><li><p>
Allow everybody in u-projectA and also account nick

<pre     class="programlisting">
+@u-projectA
+nick
</pre>
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The information about nick (home directory, login shell and so on) comes
out of the NIS passwd map. It is better to avoid putting
explicit account names in here, because management of these entries is
not centralized.
</p><p>
To make this +/- syntax work, your clients need to have the entry

<pre     class="programlisting">
