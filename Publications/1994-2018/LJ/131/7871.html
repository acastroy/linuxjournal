In the beginning, there were forking servers and then came threaded servers. Although they manage a few
concurrent connections well, when network sessions
reach into the hundreds or even thousands, forking
and threading servers spawn too many separate,
resource-consuming processes to be efficient. Today,
there is a better way, asynchronous servers. A new
breed of frameworks for third-generation languages
is taming the once complex world of event-driven
programming.
</p><p>
A rising star in the Python community has
been Twisted, which makes asynchronous programming
simple and elegant while providing a massive
library of event-driven utility classes. In this article, I discuss
asynchronous event-driven programming and how it's done in
Twisted. Because reading about code only gets you so
far, I cite examples from a real Twisted application developed
for this article: a simple proxy server that blocks unwanted cookies,
images and connections. Instructions on how to get
the complete source code are in the on-line Resources.

What Is Twisted?</h2></div></div><p>
The Twisted Project has been gaining popularity as a powerful and
increasingly stable way of implementing networked applications. At
its core, Twisted is an asynchronous networking framework. But
unlike other such frameworks, Twisted boasts a rich set of integrated
libraries for handling common protocols and programming tasks, such
as user authentication and even remote object brokering. One of the
philosophies behind Twisted is breaking down traditional separations
among toolkits, as the same server that serves Web content could resolve
DNS lookups. Although the package itself is quite large, applications
need not import all the components of Twisted, so run-time overhead is kept
to a minimum.
</p><p>
As with Python, Twisted's user base has been expanding from its academic roots
to the commercial and government sectors. At Zoto, we're using Twisted in a
distributed photo storage and management application, because it enables
us to develop scalable network software quickly in a famously productive
language, Python. Programming day to day, I appreciate Twisted for its
impressive toolkit and supportive community. And as with all community-oriented
open-source projects, Twisted is a safe business bet, because its existence
doesn't hinge on the continued support of any single company or institution.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x129b580.0x1393558"></a>
What Is Asynchronous Programming?</h2></div></div><p>
Have you ever been standing in the express lane of a grocery store, buying a
single bottle of water, only to have the customer in front of you challenge
the price of an item, causing you and everyone behind you to wait five
minutes for the price to be verified? Plenty of explanations
of asynchronous programming exist, but I think the best way to understand
its benefits is to wait in line with an idle cashier. If the cashier
were asynchronous, he or she would put the person in front of you on hold and
conduct your transaction while waiting for the price check. Unfortunately,
cashiers are seldom asynchronous. In the world of software, however,
event-driven servers make the best use of available resources, because
there are no threads holding up valuable memory waiting for traffic on a
socket. Following the grocery store metaphor, a threaded server solves
the problem of long lines by adding more cashiers, while an asynchronous
model lets each cashier help more than one customer at a time.
</p><p>
This isn't to say there aren't benefits to a threaded model. For instance,
with microthreads, the amount of resources used by any particular thread
is reduced substantially. There's an inherent complexity in asynchronous
programming, especially when you need to do many blocking operations in
succession. In Python, however, the benefits of threading are diminished
by Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). Threaded programming in
Python is refreshingly simple, because all internal Python operations are
thread-safe. To add an item to a list or set a dictionary key, no locks
are required, so as to avoid race conditions among threads. Unfortunately, this
is implemented through an interpreter-wide lock that Python's interpreter
uses liberally. So, although two threads safely can append to the same
list at the same time, if they're appending to two different lists,
the same lock is used. Because threaded Python applications suffer a
resulting performance hit, asynchronous single-thread programming is
all the more desirable for a language such as Python.

Accepting Connections and Sending Responses</h2></div></div><p>
Let's start with a simple example of a server that accepts connections
on port 1100. For each connection, it sends the UNIX time and closes
the socket.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x129b580.0x13937c0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. This simple Twisted server sends the time and then closes
the socket.</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
import time
from twisted.internet import protocol, reactor

class TimeProtocol(protocol.Protocol):
    def connectionMade(self):
        self.transport.write(
            'Hello. The time is %s' % time.time())
        self.transport.loseConnection()

class TimeFactory(protocol.ServerFactory):
    protocol = TimeProtocol

reactor.listenTCP(1100, TimeFactory())
reactor.run()
</pre></div><p>
Addressing the complexity of handling multiple sessions with one thread
is at the core of a framework such as Twisted. Network sessions are
represented by subclasses of the twisted.internet.protocol.Protocol
class, such that each Protocol instance represents a network
session. These objects are spawned by Factory objects, which inherit from
twisted.internet.protocol.Factory. A singleton,
twisted.internet.reactor, handles the dirty work of polling sockets and invoking events. Calling
reactor.run() in Twisted simply starts the event loop, and run() exits
when the application finishes, the same as an event loop in GTK or Qt.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x129b580.0x13939d0"></a>
The Proxy Server Example</h2></div></div><p>
Our proxy server has two kinds of networked chat sessions:
incoming HTTP requests and their respective outgoing proxies. Because
HTTP is a chat-like protocol, we can inherit our protocol class from
Twisted's LineReceiver, which subclasses Protocol while providing extra
functionality useful for chat sessions, such as HTTP. Twisted actually
includes classes specifically for making and handling HTTP requests. We
are writing our own in part because Twisted's prefab classes don't
facilitate proxy serving and also because it's a good programming exercise
for this article.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7871f1.large.jpg"><img src="7871f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Class diagram for a proxy server. The Protocol
classes handle individual connections while the Factory classes create
them.
</p></div></div><p>
Refer to Figure 1 for the class structure we are going to use. Instances
of the Factory classes are used by Twisted to spawn off Protocol
instances for each connection made. We create one SimpleHTTP
class and inherit from it classes for managing incoming and outgoing
traffic. Because HTTP is mostly the same for client and server, we can
manage most of the lexical processing in one superclass and let subclasses
do the rest, which is exactly how Twisted's own HTTP classes work.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x129b580.0x1393ce8"></a>
Handling Callbacks</h2></div></div><p>
Operations you'd otherwise do with one or two methods tend to require
several callback methods in event-driven programming. The rule of
thumb is, any time there's a blocking operation you need to wait on, it
happens outside your code and, therefore, between two of your methods. In
the case of our proxy server, we can break down into separate chunks each
part of handling a request. Most of what a proxy server does amounts
to reading in data from a browser, making a few changes to that data
and sending the modified data to the remote Web server. As of HTTP/1.1,
multiple Web hits can be handled over one network connection. In Figure
2, you can see what happens to each request, keeping in mind that multiple
requests can be made per HTTP connection. Arrows connecting boxes show
which events are spawned and in what order.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7871f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Overall Steps in Processing Proxy Hits
</p></div></div><p>
In a blocking program, one might expect to handle opening a remote
connection and sending it a line of text like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
connection = socket.open(remote_server, remote_port)
connection.write(get_string)
response = connection.readline()
</pre>
</p><p>
We've all seen this kind of blocking code before, so what is different about the
Twisted way? Because we don't want to wait around for the connection to
be made in an event-driven program, we simply schedule some code to run
when the remote server gets back to us. In Twisted, this kind of deferment
is handled by using an instance of the twisted.internet.defer.Deferred
class as a placeholder for the result you would expect from a blocking
operation. For example, in our proxy server, we accept a Deferred object
when we initiate a remote connection (Listing 2).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x129b580.0x13940b0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 2. Deferring operations
in Twisted are like putting them on hold until a blocking operation gets
back to us.</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
d = self.outgoing_proxy_cache.getOutgoing(
    host, int(port))
d.addCallback(self.outgoingConnectionMade, uri)
d.addErrback(self.outgoingProxyError, uri)
</pre></div><p>
The self.outgoing_proxy_cache.getOutgoing method initiates an outbound
proxy connection. It doesn't wait, however, for the connection to be made to
return to the caller; it returns immediately. The behavior of all methods
to return as soon as possible is what makes a single-threaded server
possible. Any and all CPU time taken by a method is spent processing, not
waiting for external things to happen.
</p><p>
Notice how as a replacement for the connection object itself, a Deferred
object is returned. By calling addCallback and addErrback on the Deferred
object, we are scheduling future events to be fired, such that when an
outbound connection is ready, the self.outgoingConnectionMade method
is called. By passing uri as a second argument to addCallback,
we are telling Twisted that self.outgoingConnectionMade also should be
called, with uri as an additional argument.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x129b580.0x1394318"></a>
Handling Errors</h2></div></div><p>
In the event of an error, self.outgoingProxyError is called with a
Failure object, which brings us to error handling. Python's traditional
error handling is done through exceptions, a concept familiar to other
high-level languages, such as Java (Listing 3).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x129b580.0x1394420"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 3. Traditional Error Handling in Python
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
try:
    (offending code)
except ValueError:
    (error handling code)
except MyError:
    (error handling code)
</pre></div><p>
Although Python's model of exception handling works exceptionally
well (pun intended) for synchronous designs, it does not take
into account asynchronous design. For example, when we initiate an
outbound HTTP connection, Twisted continues processing other
events while the connection is made. But, we want to specify behavior
to address any problems that may occur at the time we request the
connection. Fortunately, the good people making Twisted took this into
account. Just as code is scheduled to run when a blocking operation
completes successfully, it also can be scheduled to run in case of an
error.
</p><p>
Twisted also handles all exceptions raised within the event loop, with
hooks for developers to manage and log exceptions. This has an added
benefit too: although an exception might abort a specific event from
completing, it does not bring down the server, even if you haven't put
any exception-handling code in place.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x129b580.0x1394688"></a>
Twisted Classes and Event Handling</h2></div></div><p>
When using some of the Twisted classes, such as the LineReceiver class
we're using, you can handle many events simply by adding methods with
the correct names to your classes. Each time the protocol receives a
line, the lineReceived method is invoked with the text of the line
as an argument. Our SimpleHTTP class, which is intended to do minimal
processing of an HTTP session, has methods such as these:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
startNewRequest: invoked at the beginning of each request.
</p></li><li><p>
lineReceived: designed to facilitate chat-oriented protocols. Each time a line of text comes
over the socket, this method automatically is called.
</p></li><li><p>
rawDataReceived: when sending a binary file or raw streams of data,
it isn't reasonable to process information separated by newline
characters. To account for this, LineReceiver lets us switch to raw
mode transfer, in which case rawDataReceived is called instead
of lineReceived.
</p></li><li><p>
handleFirstLine: HTTP works by starting each request with a single
line. Generally, the client is sending a GET or POST request with a
URI, and the server responds with a status code. handleFirstLine is used
to handle either of these cases.
</p></li><li><p>
handleHeadersFinished: invoked when HTTP headers are sent fully.
</p></li><li><p>
handleRequestFinished: invoked when the HTTP request itself
has completed.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Writing separate methods for states or actions that occur in the
processing of a protocol is how Twisted programmers queue up events. At
the beginning of a request, we can specify events to occur at each
stage of handling a request. In our earlier example, we decided to call
self.outgoingConnectionMade once a connection has been made. Let's take
a look at that method, as shown in Listing 4.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x129b580.0x1394c60"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 4. Scheduling Events in Twisted
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

def outgoingConnectionMade(self, outgoing_proxy,
                           uri):
    """
    This occurs when our outbound proxy has
    connected. It's a Twisted callback method.
    """
    assert(outgoing_proxy, OutgoingProxy)
    self.outgoing_proxy = outgoing_proxy
    outgoing_proxy.incoming_proxy = self

    # Send HTTP command and echo back result
    outgoing_proxy.write('%s %s %s' % \
        (self.http_command,
         uri,
         self.http_version) \
         + self.delimiter)

    outgoing_proxy.firstline_sent_def.addCallback(
        self.outgoingFirstlineReceived)

    # Send anything we have queued.
    self.flushOutgoingBuffer()

    # Add callbacks for when headers are ready
    outgoing_proxy.headers_finished_def.addCallback(
        self.outgoingHeadersReceived)
    outgoing_proxy.request_finished_def.addCallback(
        self.handleOutgoingRequestFinished)

</pre></div><p>
Notice that outgoing_proxy represents the connection
we are making to a remote server, on behalf of the
Web browser we are serving. We're sending the HTTP
request by calling outgoing_proxy.write. We're also
scheduling the self.outgoingFirstlineReceived method
to be called when a response is received from the
remote server. The self.outgoingHeadersReceived
method is called when the remote server has sent back
all of its HTTP headers. Finally, self.handleOutgoingRequestFinished is
called when the remote server has finished entirely responding to
our outgoing HTTP request.
</p><p>
Although the outgoingConnectionMade method returns
before any of this happens, we're lining up events
to happen in the future. It well may be that while
waiting for a response on one connection, ten other
requests are opened and closed&mdash;all in the same
thread. All information relevant to a connection is stored
as instance data on protocol classes. Factories
spawn protocol instances, protocol instances keep
session states and deferred objects bind future data
to event handlers. Completing the puzzle, the reactor
manages the dirty work of polling sockets. This is the combination of
tools upon which Twisted is built.

Wrap-Up</h2></div></div><p>
You can download for tinkering all 606 lines of the proxy server discussed in this
article. Although I wouldn't put the company intranet behind
it, I've been using it for a week now to filter out unwanted cookies and
images and even to block access to a certain vendor from my desktop. When
I started using Twisted, it was easy to wrap my head around the concept
of asynchronous programming, a little harder to figure out how to map
events to the flow I wanted and harder still to explain it to someone
else. Do not be discouraged, however. Although we at Zoto started with almost no Twisted
knowledge, we've built a fully functional and extremely scalable
clustered application to store and manage on-line photos in less than
a year, with only one person (me) working full-time on the server.
</p><p>
Of course, Twisted is not for everyone. Its vastness, although powerful,
can be intimidating. For a simple asynchronous chat server in Python,
take a look at Medusa. Like Twisted, Medusa organizes asynchronous
programming into Factories (called Dispatchers) and chatting classes.
