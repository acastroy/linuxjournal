Captive Audience and CAD</h4><p>
Your magazine is my absolute favorite! Over the last
few years (while in prison), I have become a radical
fanatic of the Linux/Open Source Movement, and since
I have a captive audience, I preach the virtues and
advantages of open-source apps and the power of the
Linux OS to anyone that will listen. Needless to
say, I have had many spirited discussions concerning
that other OS while in the shower. Regardless, I'm
sending out &ldquo;Fresh Meat&rdquo; to the streets with the
Linux message.
</p><p>
Seriously though, I just wanted to relay my profound respect to all the
hackers and followers out there whose genius and devotion has created and
sustained this computing revolution.
</p><p>
Finally, I am interested in Computer Aided Drafting and Design
programs and the formatting standards used by manufacturers.
Thus, I am wondering if there are any open-source CADD
programs used by industry or projects in the works,
because I don't recall reading anything regarding
this subject.
</p><p>
PS: Because I will be released very soon (3/2/05) and I want to get
involved (seriously involved) with the Linux/Open Source Movement, I hope
to someday meet and become friends with all of you at the <i  >Linux Journal</i>.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Mark Allen Laliberte  <br><span class="orgname">(AKA Mr Linux)</span><br>
</p><p>
Thanks for writing. There is a GPL program called
QCad that looks promising. We'll look for an article
on open-source CAD for a future issue. When you get
out, check the Industry Events section of our Web
site for conferences and tradeshows where you can
meet us in person.  &mdash;Ed.

What to Call the Users?</h4><p>
I would like to propose a temporary moratorium on
the use of the terms Linux and user-friendly
in the same sentence. More and more users are
adopting Linux as their OS of choice because what they
consider friendly is being redefined. A friend
might attempt to educate you, or expect you to raise
your level of awareness to realize the full potential
of your friendship. But a friend would never
answer your phone without permission, give personal
information to strangers that come to your door or
announce to the world where you hide your spare key!
</p><p>
Therefore, I hereby petition the editors of
this, my favorite publication, to replace the
term user-friendly with abuser-friendly where
appropriate. As in: &ldquo;A major consideration of most
home PC users when considering a REAL OS, such
as Linux or, on that rare occasion, some lesser
alternative, is the level of abuser-friendliness...&rdquo;,
or, &ldquo;Many industry insiders are of the opinion
that Linux will never be what you might call an
abuser-friendly OS.&rdquo;

Open Up Old Articles, Please</h4><p>
I was quite surprised at being greeted with a
subscription-only viewing of articles printed in your
highly esteemed magazine.
Is there some way that you can open up articles in
kernel land only, which are a month or two old, for
general viewing, something similar to what <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Magazine</em></span> does?

Bus Reading</h4><p>
I've been an <i  >LJ</i> subscriber for three years or so, and sometimes I take a first look
at the magazine on the bus while going to work. Today, a funny thing
happened to me. A person came to ask if this is a Linux-dedicated
journal and where could he get it. Linux has little expression in
Portugal and Linux-related publications are hard to find, so I gave him
the <i  >LJ</i> subscription form that comes with the
magazine, hoping that one
more person will learn the advantages of using a open-source OS.

Starting Young on the Kernel Books</h4><p>
I thought you might get a kick out of my son Gus examining my <span   class="emphasis"><em>IA64 Linux
Kernel</em></span> book. He also enjoys chewing on it, though that does make it a
bit more difficult, and soggy, for me to use.

Pumpkin Project</h4><p>
Here is my family's Tux-O-Lantern from Halloween 2004.
The Tux-O-Lantern repelled bad spirits while attracting the attention of
kids and Linux fans alike&mdash;like there is much of a difference between
kids and Linux fans!

Luca's Birthday Issue</h4><p>
I know, I know, too much babies and Linux, but don't
blame me, it's the best day of my life. This is
my recently born son, named Luca, with an issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, the day after he was born. He felt
tired and decided to take a nap after browsing all
the <i  >LJ</i> material.

Take-Anywhere Desktop?</h4><p>
The basic objective for me is a common desktop or
desktop continuity; XFCE calls it persistent desktop.
I want the same desktop at home and work&mdash;and
there are plenty of options for solving this problem.
</p><p>
The most recent suggestion is a bootable mini-distro
on a thumbdrive; however, that means that the
hardware has to be USB-bootable. And then there
are the discussions about the lifespan of the Flash
thumbdrives.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Richard   <br><br>
</p><p>
If you carry a live CD for each hardware architecture
you use plus a copy of your home directory on a thumbdrive, you can work even on hardware that won't boot
from USB.  &mdash;Ed.

Geekcorps Needs Linux Radio Gurus</h4><p>
In the past, you've written
good articles about Geekcorps' work
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6017" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6017</a>) and we
thank you.
Now, we're in the enviable position of offering
volunteering opportunities to Linux professionals
again, and we're wondering if you can help us spread
the word.
</p><p>
Geekcorps (<a href="http://www.geekcorps.org" target="_self">www.geekcorps.org</a>) is looking
for a few volunteers to travel to Mali, West Africa
to help teach Malian radio stations and community
centers how to work with audio tools and software on
Linux-based systems, connect the systems by Wi-Fi over
several kilometers and maintain both the systems and
connections with great ingenuity and minimal expense.
 These volunteers are needed immediately
 (January&ndash;February 2005) and
would stay in Mali about four months, teaching small
groups in a hands-on setting. More volunteers will
be needed starting in March or April to continue
the experience.
</p><p>
Fluent French and at least 3&ndash;5 years of professional
experience with advanced audio tools and/or Wi-Fi
on Linux is a must. Radio broadcasting and/or Wi-Fi
antenna and mast construction experience preferred.
Willingness to work with people and innovate with
minimal technical equipment in a developing country
also is a must. Airfare, lodging, a small living
stipend and dedicated in-country staff are provided.

Missing Code?</h4><p>
I'd have to agree with an earlier Letter to the Editor, please put the
code samples back in the magazine. What if I'm on a plane and have no
connection to the Net? I'd gladly pay an extra $5 for my subscription.

<br><br>&mdash;<br>

</p><p>
We never took any code examples out. We merely
consolidated big lists of URLs into jump pages on our
Web site. The code examples are still there, and we're
keeping it that way. Besides the examples that appear
in print, we sometimes put a whole application on
the FTP site to save you some typing.  &mdash;Ed.

HP Laptop Support</h4><p>
I am surprised that HP will support a laptop with Linux. Every time I
call in or send an e-mail for support I am told that it is not supported
on any HP laptops.

Try it now. We got Linux phone support for the HP
nx5000 on our first call from the second person we
talked to.  &mdash;Ed.

Photo of the Month: Antarctic Dawn</h4><p>
We were prepping for dive operations near the
Bismark/Gerlache Straits at about 1:30 AM when my
coworker Fred Stuart strolled out on deck carrying
my November copy of <i  >LJ</i>. I told him &ldquo;Fred, only you
would walk out into a beautiful Antarctic dawn reading
<i  >Linux Journal</i>.&rdquo;

Send Your <span   class="emphasis"><em>What</em></span> on a Postcard?</h4><p>
I was astounded when I saw what was on the cover of the <i  >Linux Journal</i> that I received today&mdash;a form to fill out to order the
archive CD and a space to fill in credit card info and it's all
conveniently mailable on a POSTCARD????
</p><p>
Anyone dumb enough to fill out that info on a POSTCARD and send
it in would, I would think, barely have the capability to read
and, unfortunately, some of them would likely blame
<i  >LJ</i> if and
when they found out how someone had obtained their credit card
number, expiration date and even their signature.
</p><p>
I would advise you to mention this oversight to the marketing
department or whoever is responsible for this. No offense to
you or any other individuals there, but it seems like an
incredibly obvious oversight for no one to have thought of this
before it was sent.
