If you want to get Linux into big enterprise customers' data centers,
you need a working group that speaks their language. Here's how
OSDL is matching data center needs to development work.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xeff580.0xff7348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
A lot is happening at the Open Source Development Labs
(OSDL). The Carrier Grade Linux initiative helps
Linux gain new grounds in the telecom world, and the
Data Center Linux (DCL) initiative is working to accelerate
the adoption of Linux in enterprise data centers.
The Desktop Linux initiative aims to accelerate the
adoption of Linux desktops. Plus a lot of activities,
such as the higher educational forum, kernel testing,
the legal defense fund, Linux advocacy to the world
and much more are keeping OSDL busy. In this short article, I
introduce the Data Center Linux initiative and report
on its goals and ongoing work.
</p><p>
The DCL community is made up of vendors, users
and open-source developers that interact and define
a Linux road map for data centers. It's a place where
people's interests meet and create a collective will
to help advance Linux in this sector.
</p><p>
The goal
is to accelerate Linux adoption in enterprise-class
data centers. DCL functions as a center of gravity
for developers, users, vendors and the Open Source
community to work together toward a common goal:
improve Linux capabilities and feature requirements
to accelerate the development and adoption of
Linux in the data center.
</p><p>
The working
group has many responsibilities. It captures, discusses, publishes,
develops, validates and monitors Linux capabilities needed for its
adoption in enterprise data centers. The DCL Technical Capabilities
v1.0 document is the work of current OSDL members. As for technical
contributions, for the hackers among us, DCL has been working to identify
existing open-source projects that meet the requirements identified in
the technical capabilities document and contribute or initiate open-source projects to meet the identified needs.
</p><p>
The working group follows open working methods collaborating with industry
companies and end users to identify a list of the capabilities needed in Linux
and prioritize them, very similar to the goals of other OSDL working
groups. This list, then, is used as guidance for member companies and
the Open Source community to help them start or refocus development
efforts centered around data center capabilities to Linux.
</p><p>
The Technical Capabilities v1.0 document describes
many capabilities categories, such as scalability, RAS
(reliability, availability and serviceability),
performance, manageability, clustering, standards,
security and usability. Some of these categories are
common to other OSDL initiatives. For this reason,
OSDL has identified those common areas among its
working groups and created Special Interest Groups
(SIGs) where these issues are discussed independently
of a specific initiative. Current SIGs include
the Storage Networking SIG, which covers direct-attached storage; the
Security SIG covers aspects
of security; the Clustering SIG examines
clustering capabilities; and the Hot Plug SIG
focuses on CPU, memory, I/O bus and node hot-plug
capabilities.
</p><p>
Several recent contributions have been made available from the DCL
working group, for example, the work
on hardening crash dump utilities that enable first-time failure data
capture and analysis. Another example is that of persistent device naming,
in particular persistent storage device naming. These contributions
are significant&mdash;especially when systems (or nodes) grow and scale and
interconnect in large networked environments, such capability becomes
essential.
</p><p>
Based on the goal of the DCL initiative, the success of DCL can be
realized when there is an increase in Linux deployment in the data
center. At this point, the work is going at full speed. Only time will
tell what the future holds for DCL.
</p><p>
Participation is open to anyone who wants to contribute
to the DCL initiative. For more information, please visit

of information in addition to various documents that are available
for download.
