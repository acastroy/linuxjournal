Your door might be nice, but do you really need
23 hours of video of it standing closed? Use this
software to process your security videos to include
only the key events, so you can catch entries and
exits.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc5580.0xebd2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Let's say you have a room full of thousands of dollars' worth of
computer equipment. That's probably something you want to keep an eye
on, right? With that in mind, you install a network-connected camera.
Now, you can surf over to the camera's Web page and see what's going on
in the server room at any time of day or night. That's an improvement,
but you quickly realize some sort of recording facility is needed,
in case you need to figure out who was in the room last Tuesday. So,
you start saving the video to another system on the network for possible
viewing at a later time. Maybe you write a few scripts to rotate the video
after a week or so to keep from filling up your hard drive.
</p><p>
After wading through hours of video to find out who &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo;
your favorite screwdriver, you realize further refinements are necessary.
Wouldn't it be great if the computer could keep only the interesting
video and throw out everything else? Enter Motion, a free
motion-detection program. Process your video through it, and
24 hours of daily video becomes 15 minutes of video clips documenting
every time something moved in that room&mdash;technology to the rescue.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc5580.0xebd450"></a>
The Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
Motion works with either standalone netcams, such as those offered by
Axis (see the on-line Resources), or any camera connected to a video4linux-compatible
video capture card. I concentrate here on using a standalone camera, the Axis
2100, because it's simpler to set up. In any case, you need a
Linux system to save the video and to run Motion as well. Motion can
require
quite a bit of processing power, but a system with a Pentium III CPU or
higher should work okay if the machine is dedicated to running only Motion.
</p><p>
Installation and configuration of the Axis camera is straightforward.
Pick a location for it in the room you want to monitor, and run power
and Ethernet cables. In my experience, a camera mounted slightly
above eye level, seven feet up or so, in a corner of the room provides the
best coverage. Follow the camera install instructions to assign it an
IP address on your network. Then, verify that the camera works by pointing
your Web browser at the camera's Web page.
</p><p>
The computer system that is going to save the video and run Motion can be
situated anywhere you like. It's probably best to keep it on the same
logical and physical network as the camera, for simplicity's sake.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc5580.0xebd608"></a>
The Software</h2></div></div><p>
Any modern Linux distribution should work fine. I use Fedora Core 1 in
my setup.
</p><p>
Obtain Motion from the Motion Web site (see Resources).
The current version at the time of this writing is 3.1.16. You can use either the RPM supplied on
the Motion Web site or build from source. I don't recommend using RPMs
or Debian packages from elsewhere as they tend to be out of date
and lacking features. Numerous important changes have occurred in
Motion development in a few months' time.
</p><p>
The only other software dependency is the ffmpeg library, which Motion
uses to generate MPEG videos. You must use the released version 0.4.8
of ffmpeg, as newer development versions do not work well with Motion.
Download ffmpeg source (see Resources); you must have ffmpeg
built and installed before building Motion. Otherwise, Motion attempts
to use an older tool called mpegplayer to create videos. You probably
don't have that installed either, so Motion won't work very well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc5580.0xebd7c0"></a>
Building the Software</h2></div></div><p>
After you have downloaded both Motion and ffmpeg, untar them
in a directory such as /tmp. Then, <tt  >cd</tt> to the ffmpeg source
directory and run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc5580.0xebd978"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The last command must be run as root.
</p><p>
These commands install the ffmpeg libraries under /usr/local/lib. Then,
<tt  >cd</tt> to the
Motion source directory and again run <tt  >./configure</tt>.
This time, make sure to check the results. In particular, under
Configure Status, FFmpeg Support must say Yes. If not, Motion
didn't find the ffmpeg library on your system. This is the number one
cause of problems and confusion when installing Motion. Don't continue
until you resolve this problem. Figure out where on your system the
file libavcodec-0.4.8.so is located, and rerun configure in the Motion
directory as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure --with-ffmpeg=/some/random/path
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you are able to run configure and see it report <tt  >FFmpeg Support:
Yes</tt>, you can build and install motion:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ make
# make install
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc5580.0xebdce8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Again, the final command must be run as root.
After all of this completes, you will have a /usr/local/bin/motion executable on
your system.
</p><p>
Refer to the Motion Guide (see Resources)
if you encounter any
problems building or installing Motion. Some of the guide is outdated,
but it contains a useful explanation of how to install and operate
Motion.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc5580.0xebde48"></a>
Configuring Motion</h2></div></div><p>
Motion runs as a d&aelig;mon, constantly analyzing and storing video. It is
controlled by a configuration file, per the standard UNIX paradigm. Copy
the file motion-dist.conf from the source directory to /etc/motion.conf,
and edit a few parameters. The first thing you need to change is the
netcam_url setting. Motion retrieves JPEG images from the camera
through this URL. For the Axis 2100 camera, this takes the form
http://netcam.example.com/axis-cgi/jpg/image.cgi?resolution=640x480.
When you set the netcam_url variable in motion.conf, all the settings
pertaining to directly connected video cameras, such as video device,
rotate, height and width, are ignored.
</p><p>
You should be aware of one limitation between netcams and standard video
capture devices. Motion at this time knows how to request images
from netcams only one JPEG snapshot at a time. The overhead of this limits
your video to a maximum of 12&ndash;15 frames per second (fps). Some work has
been done to pull the images from the cameras in motion-jpeg
streams, but that effort is not yet complete. In practice, 10 or 12fps is
perfectly adequate for surveilling a room.
</p><p>
You need to decide where to keep your Motion-generated videos. I
generally use the directory /var/log/vcr on my Linux server. The
location you use depends on your disk-space situation. Ideally, you
should create a new filesystem exclusively for the Motion videos in order to avoid
filling your root or /var filesystem with video files. This
directory is set with the variable target_dir in motion.conf.
</p><p>
Next, decide on the type of video you want to create.
Motion 3.1.16 supports MPEG1, MPEG4 and MS-MPEG4.
MPEG1 has the advantage of being a simple and
well supported format. However, MPEG4 offers better
video and better compression. The final format,
MS-MPEG4, is understood by Microsoft Windows Media
Player without any special plugins.
</p><p>
One warning: MPEG4 and MS-MPEG4 support were introduced in Motion
3.1.16, so they have not been tested as extensively as MPEG1 video has
been.
I have found MS-MPEG4 to work fine, however, and it is much easier for
Windows users to view. MPlayer or any other modern video player can be
used to watch video in any format on Linux systems.
</p><p>
The video type is controlled by the motion.conf variable
ffmpeg_video_codec.
</p><p>
This should be enough basic configuration for you to start using Motion.
You should check that output_normal is off; otherwise, JPEG images of all
the frames are stored in target_dir. This may be useful later on for
debugging, but right now it is unnecessary clutter.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc5580.0xebe160"></a>
Starting Motion</h2></div></div><p>
Run Motion from the command line, as root, with the command
<tt  >/usr/local/bin/motion</tt>.
Motion should start up and continue running. If it aborts immediately,
there probably is an error in your config file. Follow the error
messages to troubleshoot. Once you have it fixed so that Motion starts
and continues to run, generate some input. Walk in front of the camera
or, better yet, have an assistant do it. Remember to turn the lights on
in your server room, or the camera might not pick up much action.
</p><p>
As the activity in front of the camera starts, Motion begins to generate an output file. After the activity stops, check your
targer_dir for the resulting output file. Examine the file with your
video player.
The video may appear jerky because of
the limitations of pulling the still images from the netcam. Motion
fills in the missing frames so that the video runs at normal speed, and
it may have the stop-motion quality you see on convenience store
cameras.
If everything looks good, it's time to set up Motion to run on system
startup.
</p><p>
To make Motion run on every system boot, set up an init script. On
Red Hat-based systems, copy motion.init from the Motion source directory
to /etc/init.d/motion and run, as root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# /sbin/chkconfig --add motion
# /sbin/chkconfig motion on
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, test that the initscript works by running it manually with
<tt  >/etc/init.d/motion start</tt>.
Finally, if you are paranoid, reboot the system and verify that
motion is up and running after system boot.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc5580.0xebe478"></a>
Tweaking Your Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Like any good Linux program, Motion has many tuning variable.
The best
advice when you tune Motion is to change one variable, restart Motion
and test. Some of the configuration variables can have non-obvious
interactions with one another.
</p><p>
As a first step, you might want to turn on the locate and text_changes
motion.conf variables. Locate draws a box around the motion
detected in each frame, and text_changes prints the number of changed
pixels in each image in the corner of the image. These two settings
allow you to determine where Motion thinks the motion in the image is,
and how much motion there is&mdash;how many pixels have changed in the
image.
</p><p>
Right off the bat, I recognized I probably placed my camera
in the wrong spot in my server room. The room has a window that
looks into another office space. It took me a while to figure out why I
was getting so many tiny Motion movies when the only change would be a
slight brightening and dimming of the room. I finally realized that
occasionally a light-colored door in the other room would open and
reflect light through the window into my server room. Then, that light
would reflect off a shiny metal air-conditioning unit into the camera.
So even though the camera couldn't see the window at all, light bouncing
through it would produce occasional spurious results.
</p><p>
In retrospect, I should have mounted the camera to point away from
possible external light sources and away from shiny metal
surfaces. However, I decided to leave it where it was, because that
really was the best view of what was going on in the room. Instead of
moving the camera, I adjusted Motion to compensate.
</p><p>
The first thing I did was create a mask file. This simply is a
black-and-white image the same size as the camera output images,
640&times;480
for the Axis camera. Any black areas are ignored by Motion. I created
this file in The GIMP and blacked out the area corresponding to the metal
surfaces of the A/C unit. Unfortunately, Motion is picky about this
file;
you must save it as a raw, not ASCII, portable graymap (PGM) file.
</p><p>
Motion doesn't like PGM files because they are generated by The GIMP. If you
use one, Motion starts but then exits a few moments later with the
message:

<pre     class="programlisting">
This is not a ppm file, starts with 'P6'
</pre>
</p><p>
A few minutes of source code digging revealed the fix. Motion expects
the PGM file version number at the start of the file to be P5, not P6.
Edit your mask file and change the magic number at the start from P6
to P5. You can edit this file safely in vi. After that change,
Motion loads the mask file without incident.
</p><p>
This reduced, but did not eliminate, the empty motion capture videos. I
then moved on to other adjustments. I tried turning the light switch
variable,
which the comments in motion.conf indicate might help filter out
sudden light changes. I found this to be ineffective. I also
experimented with lowering the threshold, the number of changed pixels
required to trigger motion detection. The text_changes output is
useful for this as it prints the number of changed pixels on each motion
output frame. If too many bogus movies are output by
Motion, you can try to raise the threshold to a number higher than
what's printed by text_changes.
</p><p>
Ultimately, the best tweak I found was to increase motion_minimum_frames.
This is the number of frames that must contain motion before Motion
starts generating a movie. I set this variable to three and found that most
of my spurious movies from the light changing disappeared. Most of
those movies were only a few frames long, because the light level change
happened quickly. Conversely, real motion-capture events tended to be
many frames long. Thus, if you see many tiny movies
with a duration of one second or so, my advice is to increase motion_minimum_frames to at
least three and possibly more.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc5580.0xebe898"></a>
Future Improvements</h2></div></div><p>
One non-software tweak I have considered but not yet implemented is a
motion sensor for the light in my server room. This neatly solves the
problem of making sure there is enough light in the room when Motion
records an event. Something moves in the room, the lights come on and
Motion records. Motion-sensitive light switches can be found at
hardware stores for around $15 and require only basic wiring skills.
</p><p>
For now, I simply let my storage area /var/log/vcr fill with movies and
delete them manually on occasion. It probably makes sense to set up an
automated mechanism to handle this. My current thinking is that movies
should be deleted after 30 days. Obviously, this depends on your
particular needs.
</p><p>
Several experimental mjpeg support patches have appeared on the mailing
list recently. As I mentioned earlier, mjpeg means that Motion pulls a
continuous stream of images off the camera instead of requesting them
one by one. This should provide much smoother resulting videos, although
current Motion videos from netcams do have an enjoyable Keystone Kops
feel to them.
</p><p>
Active development continues on Motion. The mailing list (see
Resources) is an excellent place
to ask questions and find out about current development. Most of what
I've learned about Motion has come from reading the mailing-list
archives.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc5580.0xebeaa8"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Motion provides a solution for one of the most vexing problems we
face in the computer industry, too much data. What good is information
such as video imagery if there's more of it than you ever could watch?
With a little bit of image analysis, Motion quickly eliminates the
boring, unchanging video you don't care about. The results are more
effective server room monitoring and more time for you to work on other
projects.
