Can Linux do Quality of Service in a way that both offers high
throughput and does not exceed the defined bandwidth? Here's a thorough
test.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2494580.0x258c3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The Hierarchical Token Buckets (HTB) queuing
discipline, part of the Linux set of traffic control
functions, is a mechanism that provides QoS
capabilities and is useful for fine-tuning TCP
traffic flow. This article offers a brief
overview of queuing discipline components and
describes the results of several preliminary
performance tests. Several configuration scenarios
were set up within a Linux environment, and an
Ixia device was used to generate traffic. This
testing demonstrated that throughput accuracy can
be manipulated and that the bandwidth range is
accurate within a 2Mbit/s range.
The test results demonstrated the performance and
accuracy of the HTB queuing algorithms and
revealed methods for improving traffic management.
</p><p>
The traffic control mechanism comes into play
after an IP packet is queued for transmit on an
output interface but before the packet actually
is transmitted by the driver. Figure 1 shows where
traffic control decisions are made in relation to
packet transmission on the physical Ethernet and
transport-layer protocols, such as UDP and
TCP.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7562f1.large.jpg"><img src="7562f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The kernel makes traffic control decisions after
the packet is queued for transmit.
</p></div></div><p>
The traffic control kernel functionality, as
implemented in Linux by Alexey Kuznetsov,
includes four main components:
queuing disciplines,
classes of service,
filters and
policing.
</p><p>
Queuing disciplines are software mechanisms that
define the algorithms used for treating queued IP
packets. Each network device is associated with a
queuing discipline, and a typical queuing
discipline uses the FIFO algorithm to control the
queued packets. The packets are stored in the
order received and are queued as fast as the device
associated with the queue can send them. Linux
currently supports various queuing disciplines and
provides ways to add new disciplines.
</p><p>
A detailed description of queuing algorithms can
be found on the Internet at &ldquo;Iproute2+tc Notes&rdquo; (see the
on-line Resources).
The HTB discipline uses the TBF algorithm to
control the packets queued for each defined class
of service associated with it. The TBF algorithm
provides traffic policing
and traffic-shaping capabilities. A detailed
description of the TBF algorithm can be found in
the Cisco IOS Quality of Service Solutions
Configuration Guide (see &ldquo;Policing and Shaping
Overview&rdquo;).
</p><p>
A class of service defines policing rules, such as maximum
bandwidth or maximum burst, and it uses the
queuing discipline to enforce those rules. A
queuing discipline and a class are tied together.
Rules defined by a class must be associated with a
predefined queue. In most cases, every class owns
one queue discipline, but it also is possible for
several classes to share the same queue. In most
cases when queuing packets, the policing
components of a specific class discard packets
that exceed a certain rate (see &ldquo;Policing and
Shaping Overview&rdquo;).
</p><p>
Filters define the rules used by the queuing
discipline. The queuing discipline in turn uses
those rules to decide to which class it needs to
assign incoming packets. Every filter has an assigned
priority. The filters are sorted in
ascending order, based on their priorities. When a
queue discipline has a packet for queuing, it tries
to match the packet to one of the defined filters.
The search for a match is done using each filter in
the list, starting with the one assigned the highest
priority. Each class or queuing discipline can have
one or more filters associated with it.
</p><p>
Policing components make sure that traffic does
not exceed the defined bandwidth. Policing
decisions are made based on the filter and the
class-defined rules.
Figure 2 shows the relationship among all the
components in the Linux traffic control
mechanism.

TC Tool and HTB Definitions</h2></div></div><p>
TC is a user-level program that creates queues, classes and filters and
associates them
with an output interface (see &ldquo;tc&mdash;Linux QoS
control tool&rdquo; in Resources). The filters can be set up based on
the routing table, u32 classifiers and TOS
classifiers. The program uses netlink sockets in
order to communicate with the kernel's
networking system functions. Table 1 lists the
three main functions and their corresponding TC
commands. See the HTB Linux Queuing Discipline User Guide for details
regarding TC command options.

The HTB mechanism offers one way to control
the use of the outbound bandwidth on a given
link. To use the HTB facility, it should be defined
as the class and the queuing discipline type. HTB
shapes the traffic based on the TBF algorithm,
which does not depend on the underlying
bandwidth. Only the root queuing discipline
should be defined as an HTB type; all the
other class instances use the FIFO queue (default).
The queuing process always starts at the root
level and then, based on rules, decides which class
should receive the data. The tree of classes is
traversed until a matched leaf class is found (see
&ldquo;Hierarchical Token Bucket Theory&rdquo;).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2494580.0x258d370"></a>
Testing</h2></div></div><p>
In order to test the accuracy and performance of the
HTB, we used the following pieces of network equipment:
one Ixia 400 traffic generator with a 10/100
Mbps Ethernet load module (LM100TX3) and
one Pentium 4 PC (1GB RAM, 70GB hard
drive) running a 2.6.5 Linux kernel.
Two testing models were designed, one to test
policing accuracy and one to test bandwidth
sharing.
</p><p>
The first model (Figure 3) was used for testing the
policing accuracy of a specific defined class.
Port 1 in the Ixia machine generated traffic sent to
IP 192.168.10.200 from one or more streams. The
Linux machine routed the packets to interface
eth0 (static route) and then sent them back to the
Ixia machine on Port 2. All of the traffic control
attributes were defined on the eth0 interface. All
of the analysis was completed based on traffic
results captured on Port 2 (the Ixia machine).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7562f3.large.jpg"><img src="7562f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Test Model #1 Configuration
</p></div></div><p>
The second model (Figure 4) was used to test the
way the bandwidth of two streams from the same
class is shared. In this case, another two Ixia ports
for transmitting data were used.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7562f4.large.jpg"><img src="7562f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Test Model #2 Configuration
</p></div></div><p>
Port 1, Port 2 and Port 3 in the Ixia machine
generated traffic sent to IP 192.168.10.200, each
using one stream. The Linux machine routed
those packets to interface eth0 based on a static route
and then sent them back to the Ixia machine on
Port 2. Traffic control attributes were defined on
the eth0 interface. All analysis was done based on
the traffic result captures on Port 2 (Ixia machine).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2494580.0x258d8f0"></a>
Ixia Configuration and Limitations</h2></div></div><p>
In all of the tests, the sending ports transmitted
continuous bursts of packets on a specified
bandwidth. The Ixia 10/100 Mbps Ethernet load
module (model LM100TX3) has four separate
ports, and each port can send up to 100Mbit/s. The
Ixia load module provided support for generating
multiple streams in one port but with one
limitation: it couldn't mix the streams together
and served only one stream at a time. This
limitation exists because the scheduler works in a
round-robin fashion. It sends a burst of bytes from
stream X, moves to the next stream and
then sends a burst of bytes from stream Y.
</p><p>
In order to generate a specific bandwidth from a
stream, which is part of a group of streams
defined in one port, specific attributes of the Ixia
machine's configuration had to be fine-tuned. The
attributes that required fine-tuning and their
definitions are as follows:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Burst: the number of packets sent by each
stream, before moving to serve the next stream.
</p></li><li><p>
Packet size: the size of a packet being sent by
a stream.
</p></li><li><p>
Total bandwidth: the total bandwidth used by
all streams.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
See Table 2 for Ixia configuration details.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x2494580.0x25845a0"></a><p class="title"><b>
Table 2. Ixia Configuration
</b></p><table     summary="&#10;Table 2. Ixia Configuration&#10;" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Stream</th><th>Generated-Bandwidth</th><th>Packet Size</th><th>Burst Size</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>15Mbit/s</td><td>512B</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>10Mbit/s</td><td>512B</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2Mbit/s</td><td>512B</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>27Mbit/s</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>&ndash;</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
The goal was to determine the appropriate burst
size that would achieve the requested generated
bandwidth for each stream. Because all three streams
used the same physical line, the way the data was
sent on the line resembles the illustration in
Figure 5.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7562f5.large.jpg"><img src="7562f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Data as sent on the line from the Ixia machine
to the Linux system being tested.
</p></div></div><p>
The following equations define the relationship
between the attributes:
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7562f11.jpg"></div><p>
Table 3 explains the variables used in the equation.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x2494580.0x25853b8"></a><p class="title"><b>
Table 3. Variables Used in the Attribute Relationship Equation

Variables Used in the Attribute Relationship Equation&#10;" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Definition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>T<sub  >c</sub></td><td>The sum of the times (in seconds) it takes to send bursts

second.</td></tr><tr><td>B<sub  >n-i</sub></td><td>The requested bandwidth of stream i (bits/sec).</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
Assuming that the packet size is the same for all
streams, as in the example, the remaining
calculation is that of the burst size.
</p><p>
Because all the streams share the same bandwidth,
the requested burst values can be found by
examining the ratios between the requested
bandwidths, using the
equation B<sup  >s-i</sup> = B<sup  >n-i</sup>. This number could be
unusually large, though, so it can be divided until a
reasonable value is obtained. In order to have
different packet sizes defined for each stream,
the burst size values can be altered until the
required bandwidth is obtained for each stream. A
spreadsheet program simplifies the
calculation of multiple bandwidths.

Test Cases and Test Results</h2></div></div><p>
When defining the HTB configuration, the
following options of the tc class commands
were used in order to achieve the required results:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
rate = the maximum bandwidth a class can use
without borrowing from other classes.
</p></li><li><p>
ceiling = the maximum bandwidth that a class can use, which limits how
much bandwidth the class can borrow.
</p></li><li><p>
burst = the amount of data that could be sent at
the ceiling speed before moving to serve the
next class.
</p></li><li><p>
cburst = the amount of data that could be sent
at the wire speed before moving to serve the
next class.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Most of the traffic in the Internet world is
generated by TCP, so packet sizes representative of
datagram sizes, such as 64 (TCP Ack), 512 (FTP)
and 1,500, were included for all test cases.

From the results in Table 4, the following
statements can be made:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The maximum bandwidth a Linux machine
can forward (receive on one interface and
transmit on another interface) with continuous
streams of 64-byte packets, is approximately
34Mbit/s.
</p></li><li><p>
The burst/cburst values, which give the most
average accuracy results, are 18k/18k.
</p></li><li><p>
A linear relation exists between the burst value
and the requested rate value. This relationship
becomes apparent across tests.
</p></li><li><p>
The amount of bandwidth pushed on the
output interface doesn't affect the accuracy of
the results.

Figure 7. Graphic Analysis of Packet Size vs. Output
Bandwidth
</p></div></div><p>
Figure 7 illustrates the relationship between packet size and output
bandwidth after testing various packet sizes.
From the results in Table 4 and Figure 7, we can
conclude two things:
throughput accuracy can be controlled by
changing the cburst/burst values and
the accuracy bandwidth range size is 2Mbit/s
when using packets of sizes between 64
and 1,500 bytes.
To verify that a linear relationship exists between
the burst/cbursts values and the rate bandwidth,
multiple burst and cburst values were tested.
Table 5 shows the significant portion of the
sampled data from the test case.

18k/18k values were used as a starting point. The
burst/cburst values were obtained by using the
formula cburst/burst (Kbytes) = 18/(30M/Assign
rate).
From the results in Table 5, cburst/burst values
can be defined dynamically for the rate value,
such as when assuming a linear relationship.

Table 6 shows an example of one level of
inheritance. Class 2 and class 3 inherit the rate
limit specification from class 1 (30Mbit/sec). In
this test, the rate ceiling of the child classes is
equal to the parent's rate limit, so class 2 and class
3 can borrow up to 30Mbit/sec. The linear relation
assumption was used to calculate the cburst/burst
values of all classes, based on their desired
bandwidth.
</p><p>
Table 6 describes how the linear relationship
works in the case of one level of inheritance. In
this test, the input stream transmits continuous
traffic of 39Mbit/s, and the accumulated output
bandwidth is 31.8Mbit/s.

Classes 4, 5 and 6 inherit the rate limit of class 3
(28Mbit/s) and share it based on their own rate
limit specifications. In this test, the rate
ceiling of the child classes is equal to the parent's
rate limit, so classes 4, 5 and 6 can borrow up to
28Mbit/s. The linear relation assumption was
used for calculating the cburst/burst values of all

</p><p>
From the results of Table 7, it can be observed
that the linear relationship works in the case of
two levels of inheritance. In this test the input port

As shown in Table 8, the bandwidth is distributed
evenly when several streams are transmitting the
same number of bytes and belong to the same
class. Another test, in which the input bandwidth
in stream 1 was higher than that of streams 2 and
3, showed that the output bandwidth of stream 1
also was higher than streams 2 and 3. From
these results, it can be concluded that if more data
is sent on a specific stream, the stream is
able to forward more packets than other streams
within the same class.

Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>
The test cases presented here demonstrate one
way to evaluate HTB accuracy and performance.
Although continuous packet bursts at a specific
rate don't necessarily simulate real-world traffic,
it does provide basic guidelines for defining the
HTB classes and their associated attributes.
</p><p>
The following statements summarize the test
case results:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The maximum bandwidth that a Linux machine can forward (receive on one interface and
transmit on another interface) with continuous
streams of 64-byte packets is approximately
34Mbit/s. This upper limit occurs because every
packet that the Ethernet driver receives or
transmits generates an interrupt. Interrupt
handling occupies CPU time, and thus prevents
other processes in the system from operating
properly.
</p></li><li><p>
When setting the traffic rate to 30Mbit/s, the
cburst/burst values, which give the most
average accuracy results, are 18k/18k.
</p></li><li><p>
There is a linear relationship between the burst
value and the requested rate. The cburst/burst
values of a 30Mbit/s rate can be used as a
starting point for calculating the burst values for
other rates.
</p></li><li><p>
It is possible to control the throughput accuracy
by changing the cburst/burst values. The
accuracy bandwidth range size is approximately
2Mbit/s for 64&ndash;1,500 byte packet sizes.
</p></li><li><p>
Bandwidth is distributed evenly when several
streams are transmitting the same number of
bytes and belong to the same class.
