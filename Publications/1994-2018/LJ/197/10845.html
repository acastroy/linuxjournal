Onset's HOBO U12 Data Loggers</h2></div></div><p>
The data-logger expert Onset has expanded the capabilities to its HOBO U12
line, which now can measure and record kilowatts, air velocity, gauge
pressure, differential pressure, DC current and other energy and
environmental parameters. Onset attributes this new functionality to a
new, compact power adapter, which enables energy and building management
professionals to power external sensors that require 12-volt
A/C excitation power conveniently. The new functionality augments existing measurement
parameters, such as air temperature, relative humidity, light intensity, AC
current and AC voltage. HOBO U12 Data Loggers also can record data
unattended for up to months at a time, storing up to 43,000 measurements.
Using a USB connection, HOBO U12 data loggers offer convenient, high-speed
data offload directly to a computer or to a HOBO U-Shuttle data transport
device.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>Gamestorming</em></span> (O'Reilly)</h2></div></div><p>
The authorial threesome Dave Gray, Sunni Brown and James Macanufo have just

strategies are required to make the changes necessary to &ldquo;win in the
21st Century&rdquo;. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gamestorming</em></span> is full of practical solutions that help
one engage people in a project, to get better traction and move more

Michael Kerrisk's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Linux Programming Interface</em></span> (No Starch)</h2></div></div><p>
No Starch Press, publisher of Michael Kerrisk's 1,500-page book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Linux
Programming Interface</em></span>, bills the title as the
&ldquo;authoritative work&rdquo;
and &ldquo;definitive guide to the Linux and UNIX programming
interface&rdquo;.
Kerrisk, who is the maintainer of the Linux man pages project, presents
detailed descriptions of the system calls and library functions that one
needs in order to master the craft of system programming. He accompanies
his explanations with clear, complete example programs. Some key topics
include using signals, clocks and timers; creating processes and executing
programs; writing multithreaded programs using POSIX threads; building and
using shared libraries; performing interprocess communication using pipes,
message queues, shared memory and semaphores; and writing network
applications with the sockets API.

Blancco's Mobile Edition</h2></div></div><p>
Bond would be up a creek without a gadget should his arch-rivals get their
hands on Blancco Mobile Edition, an application designed to eliminate the
risk of inadvertent data leaks by erasing retired smartphones that may
contain sensitive business and/or personal information. Capable of erasing
up to 150 such devices per day, Blancco Mobile Edition helps IT security
managers set and enforce end-of-service policy related to smartphones, an
area frequently overlooked as a source of data breach. The application was
developed for erasure of smartphones running major platforms like Symbian,
RIM for BlackBerry, and Microsoft; support for Android-based platforms is
slated for late 2010.

xTuple's Web Portal</h2></div></div><p>
The role of xTuple's new Drupal-based Web Portal is to extend the firm's
open-source CRM, accounting and ERP applications to the Web. The xTuple
Web Portal, which can be hosted on-premise or through an xTuple Partner,
enables companies to improve customer service, establish an internal
help desk, build deeper relationships with partners or suppliers and engage
end users of the company's products. Once a conversation is initiated
in the xTuple Web Portal, an incident is created automatically that users
can categorize, prioritize and assign. In addition, users can create
opportunities, to-do lists or even full projects from that initial incident.
One can utilize all three xTuple editions on the Web Portal, namely the
free xTuple PostBooks, xTuple Standard and xTuple Manufacturing.
