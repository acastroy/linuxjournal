Setting up a Drupal Web site is pretty simple these days, until it gets
popular,
then you need to bring out the big guns and start finding and fixing
the performance bottlenecks.
In this article, we show some of the techniques that can allow
your Drupal Web site to scale to the grandiose levels you originally hoped for.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1363580.0x145b460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
When Twitter experiences an outage, users see the infamous &ldquo;fail
whale&rdquo;
error message, an illustration of twit-birds struggling to hoist a sleeping
cartoon whale into the air along with the words &ldquo;Too many tweets! Please
wait a moment and try again.&rdquo; It happens so often, Twitter has a
much-heralded illustration for it. Not too long ago, many readers may
remember Facebook going down for days at a time. True, those sites are
dealing with extraordinary levels of traffic, but smaller sites often face
the same problems. How come? First, Web sites are no longer a
collection of static pages. Nowadays, Web sites combine social-networking
features with highly customized content for individual users, meaning most
pages have to be assembled on the fly. Second, content is changing&mdash;rich
media, on-line advertising, video, telephony. There's more than text forcing
its way through the pipe, and network traffic only continues to grow.
Addressing this tandem of complexity and load is the bane of many growing
social-media Web sites' existence. What follows are some clever ways to
address this whale of a problem.
</p><p>
Surprisingly, the solutions to most scaling problems are frequently
the same, regardless of the technology upon which the site was built.
Lullabot (the parent company of this article's authors) is a
Drupal development company, meaning that most of our experience is
centered around the typical LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL and
PHP), although most techniques are universal, and some of the most
advanced performance software is platform-neutral.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1363580.0x145b720"></a>
Server Infrastructure</h2></div></div><p>
One of the main factors in scaling a Web site is, of course, the
hardware (Figure 1). System administrators always can throw more hardware at a
problem and solve it at least temporarily, if they have the resources
to do so. Quite a few services can be put in place
before this needs to be done, and developers can selectively optimize
the application by reducing or optimizing queries. Nevertheless, when
it comes to sheer numbers of users and bandwidth over a short amount
of time, there almost always comes a point where it's necessary to
include hardware in the mix. That's why it is important to have your
hardware infrastructure planned in a way that it rapidly can scale
upward on a traffic spike, and back down when your traffic recedes.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10842f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Hardware Stack
</p></div></div><p>
A typical setup, whether virtual or dedicated, usually includes
multiple Web servers, multiple database servers and sometimes even
separate caching servers, all behind a load balancer that distributes
traffic between machines. Depending on its processor speed and the
amount of available memory, a Web server or database 
often can double as the caching server, because caching services usually
require less resources than Apache or MySQL.
</p><p>
Although distributing traffic across multiple Web servers, or Web heads,
can be a quick win, it can introduce problems with managing file
uploads. If requests are being distributed round-robin by the load
balancer, a user may upload a file on one server but then be switched
to a different Web server after the upload, which doesn't have the
newly uploaded file. To solve this problem, a file server also
is added into the mix. The file server is usually some form of NAS
(Network Attached Storage) or an NFS (Network File System) mount that
allows the application to share files between machines. Each Web head
will have a copy of the application stored in the Web root, but when
it comes to the files that are uploaded or changed often by the users
of the application, an NFS mount connects all the servers to a
shared file location.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1363580.0x145ba90"></a>
Cache Techniques</h2></div></div><p>
The other main factor in scaling a Web site is, of course, the software
(Figure 2).
To scale effectively, high-traffic Web sites require some flavor or
flavors of caching. Caching mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and
most high-profile sites combine several. Most types of caching seek to
reduce the amount of disk access necessary to render a page or compile
higher-level languages into bytecode so they're faster to run&mdash;the
closer to machine language the better.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10842f2.large.jpg"><img src="10842f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Software Stack
</p></div></div><p>
APC (Alternative PHP Cache) and other opcode caches save the Web
server from having to read, parse and compile PHP files on every
request. APC is a free, open-source opcode cache and is pretty much
the standard. It will come built in with PHP 6, but there are many
different ones that perform differently.
</p><p>
Modern content management systems, like Drupal, can make a plethora of
database calls on every page request. Because calls to the database
hit the disk, it is often a bottleneck. Memcached is a service that
allows entire database tables to be stored in memory, dramatically
speeding up queries to those tables and alleviating strain on the
database. It behaves as though it were a giant hash table and serves
this data out of memory. Memcached is free, open source and in use by
a ton of high-traffic sites. Memcached is installed alongside MySQL on
the database server in most typical setups. However, the database
server needs to have a lot of RAM available if Memcached and MySQL are
sharing this critical resource. There are occasions when Memcached is
actually placed on its own server, completely decoupled from the
database server, which precludes Memcached from using too much
of the database server's memory.
</p><p>
Varnish is an excellent high-performance, HTTP accelerator. The
technical term for Varnish is a &ldquo;reverse proxy cache&rdquo;, meaning that it
handles the requests when you visit a Web site. If Apache were a
physician, Varnish would be the triage nurse. After each anonymous
page request is made, Varnish makes a copy of the page in an
ultra-fast storage so that the next time the page is requested, it
returns it immediately, circumventing a bootstrap of Apache, PHP,
MySQL, Memcached or any other technologies your Web site may require
to serve pages. If Varnish doesn't have a copy of the file or page
being requested, it will send the request on to Apache. And, it's really
a huge win if you're going to be serving static content.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1363580.0x145bf08"></a>
Outsource Search</h2></div></div><p>
Search is resource-intensive. Optimizing search will contribute to
overall site performance and is a great process to outsource to
another box. Solr can help ease an over-burdened Web server. Solr is
a project from the Apache Foundation that takes the power of Lucene, a
fantastic indexer and searcher, and exposes it as a Web service. Using
HTTP POST and GET requests, you can feed documents to Solr for
indexing and issue queries for searching. In Drupal, the Views module
serves as a visual query-builder and handles search. With Views 3, in
Drupal, you can plug in Solr to handle the search heavy-lifting
instead of having Drupal hit MySQL for this, alleviating a load on
your database server best left to a document indexer like Lucene.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1363580.0x145c010"></a>
Tune Apache</h2></div></div><p>
Apache's MaxClients setting is a limit on the number of simultaneous
requests that can be served. If this limit is reached, users have to
wait until a child process is freed up until they can connect.
If this number is increased too
much, however, there is a risk that the Web head will run out of
memory. There's a standard formula for figuring out what this setting
should be based upon the RAM available to the machine:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
formula: RAM/Average Apache Memory Size in Use = # max clients
</p></li><li><p>
example: 2GB/20MB = 100 MaxClients
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Apache's mod_expires setting controls the HTTP header information for
anything served through Apache to your machine. If a resource has been
cached on a user's computer, this setting can tell any subsequent
request to that resource if it has expired and needs to be downloaded
again. It's a good idea to have this turned on for text/HTML header
types:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;IfModule mod_expires.c&gt;
  ExpiresActive On
  ExpiresDefault A1209600
  ExpiresByType text/html A1
&lt;/IfModule&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The KeepAlive setting is a way to tell Apache to keep an HTTP
connection alive for a period of time so that it can be reused. This
has been shown to result in an almost 50% speed increase in latency
times for HTML documents with many images. Turn this on and set the
KeepAliveTimeout to 2 seconds:

<pre     class="programlisting">
KeepAlive On
KeepAliveTimeout 2
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1363580.0x145c430"></a>
Optimize MySQL</h2></div></div><p>
MySQL is the most widely used database for Drupal, although Drupal 6
also supports Postgres. Drupal 7 has an object-oriented
database abstraction layer that allows drivers to be written for many
other database systems. There are some key things to keep in mind
within MySQL's configuration that can help optimize your application
for performance.
</p><p>
MySQL has a built-in query cache that is turned on by default. Make
sure to afford a liberal amount of memory to this cache:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[mysqld] query_cache_size=32M
</pre>
</p><p>
Once your application is built, it's a good idea to log slow queries
for a short amount of time to get a list of queries that are taking a
long time and can be examined with an EXPLAIN and then optimized:

<pre     class="programlisting">
log-slow-queries = /var/log/slow_query.log
long_query_time = 5
#log-queries-not-using-indexes
</pre>
</p><p>
MySQL's EXPLAIN command is a great way to find out exactly what a
particular query is doing in order to get some clues as to why it may
be taking a long time to evaluate and return a result. One of the key
things to look at is the number of rows that EXPLAIN tells you it
had to search through. This may indicate that one of your tables,
bursting at the seams, is a good candidate for a new index.
</p><p>
Taking a look at the following query, we see there are three
fields that could have an index placed upon them in order to reduce
the number of rows that a query has to search through in order to find
the desired result:

<pre     class="programlisting">
...
FROM node node
WHERE node.status = 1
AND node.type IN ('story')
ORDER BY node.created DESC
</pre>
</p><p>
The status, type and created fields are key to this query's
result and can be indexed so that they are seen as a group:


<pre     class="programlisting">
mysql&gt; ALTER TABLE node ADD INDEX (status, type, created);
</pre>
</p><p>
Table locking can be a performance
headache. By default, Drupal's MySQL
database tables are all set to MyISAM. Because MyISAM locks the entire
table down during a query, high traffic may cause MySQL errors when a
certain table is unavailable or locked. If you start seeing these
errors, look at which tables are giving the error and evaluate whether they
should be set to InnoDB instead. InnoDB does row locking instead of
table locking. When evaluating, look to see if the table has
any auto_increment fields, and keep in mind that converting this table
may cause slow-downs on INSERTs, as InnoDB does a full table
lock on INSERTs to avoid key duplication.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1363580.0x145c958"></a>
PHP</h2></div></div><p>
Static variable caching is a quick-and-easy win in PHP. Here is an
example of a simple function with a simple query to the database:


<pre     class="programlisting">
function taxonomy_get_term($tid) {
  return db_fetch_object(
    db_query('SELECT * FROM {term_data} WHERE tid = %d', $tid)
  );
}
</pre>
</p><p>
This function can be given a simple static variable, so that if this
function happens to be called more than once on a page load, it can
skip over the call to the database and serve the result out of this
static cache:


<pre     class="programlisting">
function taxonomy_get_term($tid) {
  static $terms = array();
  if (!isset($terms[$tid])) {
    $terms[$tid] = db_fetch_object(
      db_query('SELECT * from {term_data} WHERE tid = %d', $tid)
    );
  }
  return $terms[$tid];
}
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1363580.0x145cc18"></a>
Application (Drupal)</h2></div></div><p>
Drupal is a content management framework that Lullabot uses to build
high-performance Web sites on top of this infrastructure. Drupal is
built with PHP as its primary programming language and has a ton of
user-contributed modules freely available to extend its
functionality. It has been compared to LEGOs because of this, and because
the quality of modules vary, it's a good idea to do full code reviews
of any modules that are selected for inclusion into any platform
build. If an existing module already does mostly what is needed, it
should be reviewed to make sure static variable caching is utilized,
queries are optimized and general coding standards are being used.
</p><p>
Regularly contribute patches back to modules when a module is found
lacking in any of these areas or if any general bugs are found through the
module's issue queue, which can be found on the same page where you
download the module. Performance reviews also are a good idea once a
site is built to ensure that queries are optimized and not run more than
once per page load. The Devel module is a great resource for this, as
it will give you stats on page load times, memory usage and can
display every query executed on any given page load.
</p><p>
Beyond the regular LAMP configuration optimizations, caching
techniques, and hardware infrastructure are some general Web
development best practices available within Drupal that not only
can reduce loads on various servers, but also make it easy to have some of your
data structures in code that can be version-controlled to keep track
of changes and to help with the deployment process of said changes.
The first, and relatively new, paradigm of &ldquo;exportables&rdquo; is
twofold, in that it gives you a way to read a data structure from code
instead of the database, and it also can be deployed to different
environments and reused. 
</p><p>
Exportables started with the Views module by Earl (merlinofchaos) Miles
who wanted a way to help debug the problems that his module users
might encounter. So, he created a way for users to export the view
they created into a readable data structure that he then could 
put on his own machine to help him debug. This not only had the
awesome side effect of being able to share these &ldquo;view
recipes&rdquo; with
other users, but it also evolved into a method where the structure could
replace what was read from the database and help increase the
performance. Exportables then was extrapolated into a library dubbed
Ctools (for Chaos Tools) and used for the Panels module. Other people
started catching on and implementing exportables for their modules, and
now there are a whole slew of modules that use the Ctools Exportables
for this purpose.
</p><p>
This eventually led to a module called Features that provides a UI
to choose the various exportable data structures within a Drupal
installation and wrap them up into a custom &ldquo;feature&rdquo; module, which then
can be shared. These features can be simple configuration options or
complex features requiring many other contributed modules in order to
provide feature-rich enhancements for any Drupal Web site. Not only can
it be used to share such features, but it also has become an important part of
the deployment process in creating modern Drupal Web sites.
</p><p>
Another tool that has recently matured and become a necessity to any
professional Drupalite is Drush. Drush stands for Drupal Shell and is
a way to control your Drupal Web sites through the command line. Not
only does it provide powerful commands to manipulate your
Web site quickly, but other modules can provide integration with Drush as
well, 
creating their own commands related to working with their particular
module. For example: the Features module provides commands to Drush that
allow you to list, update and revert any feature modules quickly that
are part of a Drupal installation's codebase. The Backup and Migrate
module provides integration to allow you to create SQL backups
of your Web site quickly with a simple command. Some modules
even provide commands to work with Drupal and Git! So, not only does
Drush allow you to work with your Drupal site quickly, but you also don't
have to load a huge page through Apache to do so.
</p><p>
And, of course, no professional Web site would be complete without
revision control. Lullabot has used CVS (Concurrent Versions System),
SVN (Subversion) and, most recently, made the move to Git. But no matter
what you use, it's important to have a backup of your work and
versioning for teams working on the same project. The merits of
versioning your code are many. Working on a high-performance Web site
usually takes many people, so version control becomes a
necessity.

Jerad Bitner has been using Drupal since the nightmare upgrades from 4.6 to 4.7
(that's early 2005, if you're asking). He started out as a Technical
Illustrator with C/S Group and worked for three years with Photoshop,
Illustrator, AutoCad and Macromedia products as well as PHP. When it came
time to replicate a platform across the different locations of the company,
Jerad found Drupal and hasn't looked back since.
