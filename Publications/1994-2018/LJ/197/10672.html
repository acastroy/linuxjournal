Using Google's App Engine, you can develop Web applications in
Python or Java and deploy them on Google's infrastructure for free&mdash;until you hit five million page views per month.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1721580.0x1819358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Google first announced its App Engine technology in 2008.
The Internet's search superstar will host your Web application (webapp)
on its infrastructure, initially at no charge.
Only when your webapp gets &ldquo;busy&rdquo; will Google start charging you.
By &ldquo;busy&rdquo;, Google means something in the range of five million
&ldquo;page views&rdquo; per month. Hit that threshold, and Google will come looking
for your credit-card details.
</p><p>
Apps for Google's App Engine are written in Python
(with Java recently added to the mix).
As most of you know, Python's creator (Guido van
Rossum) works for Google and spends a reported 50% of his time working
on Python's ongoing improvement and the developer ecosystem that
surrounds this increasingly popular general-purpose programming and
scripting technology.
</p><p>
Unlike most other webapp development technologies and frameworks
that require you to host your webapp yourself (or find a friendly
cost-effective ISP to host your webapp and its dependent
technologies for you), Google's App Engine abstracts away the hosting
part. Simply build your webapp to the App Engine standard, upload it
to Google, and it's then deployed in the Google
&ldquo;cloud&rdquo;. Google
handles
backups, load balancing, spikes in access, deployment, caches and
the like. All you have to worry about is your code, as there's no more
deployment distractions. And, when it comes to App Engine, it's all
about the code, which is just how we programmers like things, isn't it?
</p><p>
In this article, I explain how to build a very simple App Engine
project using the Python API. By the time you've worked through to the
end, you should know enough to be in a better position to decide
if Google's App Engine is something you want to spend more time
learning. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1721580.0x18197d0"></a>
App Engine and the MVC Pattern</h2></div></div><p>
Most modern webapp technologies are organized around the
Model-View-Controller pattern (MVC). In essence, an MVC-compliant webapp
is divided into three parts: the model handles interactions with
your webapp's data, the view looks after the user interface, and the
controller provides the application or business logic that glues
everything together. In theory, changes to how your webapp looks (the
view) should not significantly affect how your webapp stores its data
(the model), or at least any effects should be minimal and localized. Of
course, the MVC pattern can be applied to any application domain, but
it is particularly appropriate within the Web context, as each component
is (typically) physically separate from the others. For instance, your
view code runs within a browser on your client PC. Your controller code
runs on your Web server, and your model may be deployed on some sort of
datastore, which may or may not run on its own hardware.
</p><p>
App Engine conforms to the MVC pattern, and what's nice about App Engine
is that each of the MVC components is realized in code files that are
easy to keep separate from one another. You can put your code into one
big source code file if you like, but to be honest, all but the most
trivial webapps benefit from splitting out each MVC component into
its own source file.
</p><p>
Of course, App Engine doesn't really care how you structure your code
(only that it's correct), nor does App Engine care how your webapp
operates. If you want to write a basic CGI webapp, you can. You can use
Python's WSGI standard too, which is the standard we'll use
here. So, let's learn what's involved by building
a simple MVC-patterned webapp with Google App Engine.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1721580.0x1819988"></a>
Tools</h2></div></div><p>
To build an App Engine webapp, you need two things: Google's App Engine
SDK and release 2.5 of Python.
</p><p>
Although you'll deploy your App Engine webapp to Google's cloud, during
development, it is possible to test your webapp on your local machine. All
you need is a copy of the App Engine SDK, which is easy to get.
Go to the App Engine download page (see Resources) and
click on the link for the Python SDK. From the page displayed, select
the Linux download (which is a ZIP file at the time of this writing). The current App Engine documentation as well as
a Google Plugin for Eclipse also are available for download (should such things interest you).
</p><p>
With the download complete, installation is a breeze. Simply unzip the
downloaded file into a directory of your choosing. I unzipped into my HOME
directory, and a new directory called google_appengine was created.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1721580.0x1819b40"></a>
Why Python 2.5?</h2></div></div><p>
Since the end of 2008, Python comes in three distinct flavors: the
standard 2.5 release (which maintains backward-compatibility with the
installed base), the 2.6 release (which is designed to bridge the move
from the 2.5 release to future releases) and release 3 (which is the
new, backward-incompatible Python). App Engine targets a customized
and optimized version of the 2.5 release of Python that runs in Google's
cloud. You can try to run your webapp under 2.6, but my experience has
been less than satisfactory, although it can sometimes work. The 3.1
release of Python currently is not supported, so don't waste your time
trying to use it with App Engine.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1721580.0x1819c48"></a>
My Development Platform: Fedora 12</h2></div></div><p>
For this article, I'm using
Fedora 12. I used to eat, sleep and breathe Red Hat Linux (then Fedora),
but like a lot of other Linux users, I was tempted away
by the promise and then delivery of a friendlier desktop experience with Ubuntu.
As luck would have it, I recently received the latest edition of Mark G. Sobell's
book (see Resources), which includes Fedora 12 on DVD. Installation,
as expected, was straightforward. However, Fedora 12 comes with Python
2.6 pre-installed, and I needed the 2.5 release.
</p><p>
A feature of Python that I love is that multiple versions of the
interpreter can happily co-exist on your system. On my systems (desktops
and laptops), I have releases 2.5, 2.6 and 3.1 installed. Only one of
these releases is symbolically linked to the /usr/bin/python
(usually the 2.6 release), but I can invoke the other releases using
one of these command lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
python3
python2.5
</pre>
</p><p>
Deploying release 2.5 of Python on Fedora wasn't an issue. It's the
usual <tt  >tar -zxvf</tt>, <tt  >configure</tt>,
<tt  >make</tt> and <tt  >make-install</tt> four-step. As expected,
the Fedora DVD pre-installed all the development tools required to
let me build Python 2.5 from source without any issues.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1721580.0x1819fb8"></a>
Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Unlike technologies, such as Ruby on Rails or Django, which provide
a collection of helper scripts to get you up and running quickly, App
Engine forces you to do all the work yourself. Thankfully, this is not a
huge effort. To demonstrate, let's create a new project with
the rather imaginative name, myapp. Create the initial directories
and files required in your HOME directory with these commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">

mkdir myapp &amp;&amp; cd myapp
mkdir templates &amp;&amp; touch app.yaml

</pre>
</p><p>
The above commands create some required directories (more on these later)
as well as the main App Engine configuration file: app.yaml. You
edit this file to tell App Engine all about your webapp. Add the following
configuration directives to your YAML file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
application: myapp
version: 1
runtime: python
api-version: 1

handlers:
- url: /.*
  script: myapp.py
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >application</tt> line identifies your webapp, and the value needs
to match the name of the directory you just created to house
your project. Use the <tt  >version</tt> value to indicate the release of
your webapp to which this YAML file refers (this value also is used by
Google's cloud to refer to different versions of your webapp, should
they exist). The <tt  >runtime</tt> line tells the App Engine
for which platform
you are coding, and the <tt  >api-version</tt> value indicates
what
version of the API you are using.
</p><p>
The remaining three lines tell App Engine what to do with any Web requests
destined for your webapp. It is useful to think of these handlers in
the YAML file as high-level, application &ldquo;routing directives&rdquo;. The bit
after <tt  >url</tt> is a regular expression that (as all regex gurus will tell
you) matches anything that starts with a /, followed by any string
(or nothing at all). What's happening here is that any URL received by
App Engine on behalf of your webapp is going to be redirected to the
script identified on the <tt  >script</tt>&gt; line, which in this case is called
myapp.py. At the moment, no such script exists, so let's fix that.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1721580.0x181a4e0"></a>
Writing a Request-Handler Script</h2></div></div><p>
To demonstrate how an App Engine webapp is put together, let's build
a simple Web page that lets users submit their e-mail addresses
with a message. These two pieces of data are stored
in the Google cloud. A second page displays the e-mail addresses and
messages on-demand. Granted, this isn't a hugely exciting webapp, but
it's enough to demonstrate the basics of the technology and for you to
get started with something &ldquo;real&rdquo;. Of course, it is possible to build
this using App Engine's CGI mechanism (which works exactly as you would
expect), but as this application is destined for greatness, let's
code to Python's WSGI standard instead. Let's also build the webapp
to conform to the MVC pattern.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1721580.0x181a640"></a>
Defining the Model</h2></div></div><p>
As you plan to store some data in this webapp, you need somewhere
to put it, which means you need a model. App Engine provides an API
to Google's &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; datastore. All you need to do is define a Python
class that inherits from db.Model, then create the required data
fields. For the webapp, you need a field for the e-mail address and
the associated message. To keep things manageable, let's put your model
code in its own file, called myappDB.py:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from google.appengine.ext import db

class UserComment(db.Model):
    cust_email   = db.StringProperty()
    cust_message = db.TextProperty()
</pre>
</p><p>
There's not much to this model code. It simply imports
the db module from App Engine, creates a new class called
UserComment and creates class instance variables for each data
field. As App Engine's StringProperty type is limited to 500 bytes,
you need to specify TextProperty for the user message, just in case
someone has a lot to say.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1721580.0x181a850"></a>
Defining Your Controller Code</h2></div></div><p>
With the model defined, you can create the rest of your code. Create
a file called myapp.py and pop the following code into it. Note
that the code in this section is all contained in one file, but it's split
up here so I can describe its function to you. Start with
your imports:

<pre     class="programlisting">
import wsgiref.handlers

from google.appengine.ext import webapp
from google.appengine.ext import db
from google.appengine.ext.webapp import template

import myappDB
</pre>
</p><p>
After importing the Python-standard WSGI reference implementation, three
libraries are imported from App Engine: <tt  >webapp</tt> provides a simple
Web framework, <tt  >db</tt> provides access to the App Engine
datastore, and <tt  >template</tt> provides access to App Engine's standard templating
system (which is based on and built from Django's). Note that you've
also imported the just-created myappDB module, which brings your
model definitions into this program.
</p><p>
Every webapp needs to be told what to do when a user sends a default
request from a browser to a server. Typically, this is requesting the
index or home page. The first request handler provides that functionality:

<pre     class="programlisting">
class IndexHandler(webapp.RequestHandler):
    def get(self):
        html = template.render(
            'templates/index.html', {}
        )
        self.response.out.write(html)
</pre>
</p><p>
You've created a new class called <tt  >IndexHandler</tt> that's inherited
from webapp's <tt  >RequestHandler</tt>. Within the class, a Python method
called <tt  >get</tt> is invoked whenever a request for the default page is
processed. The method renders a template called index.html within the
templates directory and assigns the rendered page to the html
variable, which then is sent to standard output as the HTTP response,
which eventually makes its way to the browser. The second parameter
to the render() method is an empty hash (or &ldquo;dictionary&rdquo; to use the
correct Python terminology). It's possible to send data (template variables) to the template
engine, but you don't have to in this instance. The convention is to
send an empty hash when there's no data for the template engine to
process. I explain how to create templates later in this article.
For now, note that any HTML used by your webapp
is stored in the templates directory, which helps segregate 
view code from controller code.
</p><p>
The functionality required to leave a message has two parts. The first
presents a small form that allows users to enter their e-mail addresses
and messages. The second takes the submitted form data and stores it in the
Google cloud. Here's a request handler class that implements both parts:


<pre     class="programlisting">
class LeaveCommentHandler(webapp.RequestHandler):
    def get(self):
        html = template.render(
            'templates/comment.html', {}
        )
        self.response.out.write(html)

    def post(self):
        comment = myappDB.UserComment(
            cust_email = self.request.get("c_email"),
            cust_message = self.request.get("c_message")
        )
        comment.put()
        self.redirect("/comments")
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >get</tt> method in this class is essentially identical to the
<tt  >get</tt> method in the previous class, except in this
method, you are rendering a different template called comment.html. The
<tt  >post</tt> method (which you didn't have in the last class) responds to
a POST request sent from a browser. In other words, when users fill
in the form rendered by the <tt  >get</tt> method and then click the submit
button, the data on the form is delivered to this request handler's
<tt  >post</tt> method. The code in your
<tt  >post</tt> method first creates
a new instance of the model data by extracting two named form fields
from the posted data (referred to as c_email and c_message
in the HTML form). The submitted data is assigned to the data fields
defined in the model and then stored in Google's cloud with a call to
<tt  >comment.put()</tt>. With that done, your code immediately redirects
to a different URL (/comments), which causes another request handler's
code to activate. That is, of course, assuming you have the
&ldquo;/comments&rdquo;
handler code written. And, here it is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
class DisplayCommentsHandler(webapp.RequestHandler):
    def get(self):
        comments_query = myappDB.UserComment.all()
        comments = comments_query.fetch(1000)
        html = template.render(
            'templates/comments.html',
            {'comments': comments}
        )
        self.response.out.write(html)
</pre>
</p><p>
Your <tt  >DisplayCommentsHandler</tt> code provides only GET functionality,
as that's all that's required. Using App Engine's functional interface
to the datastore, your <tt  >get</tt> method first creates a query that
asks for all the <tt  >UserComment</tt> data, before fetching the first
1,000 comment-pairs from the query results. Your code then renders the
comments.html template, passing in the (up to 1,000) comment-pairs
to the templating engine. The rendered HTML returned from the template
system then is sent to standard output as the HTTP response.
</p><p>
The limit of 1,000 is imposed by App
Engine on all running webapps and is designed to limit the potential
harm a &ldquo;rogue&rdquo; webapp could do to the App Engine infrastructure if left unchecked.
By limiting the number of rows of data that can be fetched at once, App Engine
can attempt to ensure that no one webapp hogs all of its resources.
It's not really much of restriction. How many
Web pages attempt to display more than a few hundred database
records at a time?
Obviously, if you have more than 1,000 rows in your datastore, you need to write some
extra code to cycle through your data, 1,000 rows at a time, until you've
exhausted it all.
</p><p>
Unlike the previous two request handlers, this latest one sends data
to the templating system. The comment query results (a collection of e-mail
addresses and messages) are passed to the template for further processing.
</p><p>
You may have noticed that there's no SQL used in the
<tt  >get</tt> method within the
<tt  >DisplayCommentsHandler</tt> request
handler. Instead, you've used App Engine's API to request all the
data from the datastore, from which you've then fetched 1,000 rows of
data. Google's datastore technology, an integral component of App Engine,
doesn't support SQL. It turns out that the datastore is not a relational
database. Instead, it's based on Google's BigTable technology, which is
a different beast altogether. Google does provide a query
language of sorts in the guise of GQL, which looks a lot like SQL but doesn't
do everything you are used to being able to do with SQL.
For instance, there are no joins in GQL. Check out the App Engine
datastore documentation for all the details to see
if no SQL will be a deal-breaker for your app.
</p><p>
With the request handlers defined, all that's left to do is connect your
application's URLs to the request handlers. Recall that the app.yaml
file already has arranged for every URL request directed to your App
Engine webapp to be handled by your myapp.py program. So, the
question is, when the request gets to your program, what happens next? The
answer is that your myapp.py program handles it, of course! When
you imported webapp, you inherited functionality that allows you
to link your URLs with your request handlers. Here's the code you need:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def main():
    app = webapp.WSGIApplication(
        [ ('/comment', LeaveCommentHandler),
          ('/comments', DisplayCommentsHandler),
          ('/.*', IndexHandler)],
          debug = True
    )
    wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler().run(app)
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >WSGIApplication</tt> constructor takes a list of tuples detailing
which URL invokes which request handler. Each of the URLs in the tuple
list are regex patterns that are checked for a match to the URL that
has been delivered to your program. If a match is found, the request
handler is invoked. Note that in this code, you need a
&ldquo;catchall&rdquo;
regex to do something sensible when a delivered URL does not match one
of the URL patterns. Here, you arrange to invoke the
<tt  >IndexHandler</tt>
when no match is found. You've also switched debugging information on,
which is useful during development, but it should be switched off when you
deploy. With the URL routes ready, a call to the <tt  >run</tt> method provided
by <tt  >wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler</tt> starts your webapp.
</p><p>
The URL-routing and application-starting code is contained
within the <tt  >main</tt> function. This is deliberate, as App Engine looks
for this function when initially loading and reloading your webapp. Its
existence allows App Engine to optimize and cache your webapp. It also
allows App Engine to avoid having to load your application every time
a new request occurs, a criticism that continues to haunt CGI to this
day. Of course, to test your webapp locally, you need to tell
Python how to start it, which is accomplished with the classic Python
idiom:


<pre     class="programlisting">
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</pre>
</p><p>
And, that's it for your controller code. You've created code that does
what you require when a URL request is sent to your webapp. All that's
left is to create your view code, which, in this simple app, is a small
set of HTML templates.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1721580.0x18122c0"></a>
Defining Your Views</h2></div></div><p>
The first template is rendered when no URL or the default URL is matched
during the routing process. It's rendered by
<tt  >IndexHandler</tt>, is
stored in your templates directory, is called index.html
and looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Welcome!&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
Either &lt;a href="/comment"&gt;leave a comment&lt;/a&gt;
or check out what
&lt;a href="/comments"&gt;other people are saying&lt;/a&gt;
about this webapp.
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
As you may notice, the index.html template is plain HTML.
It displays a welcome page that offers your site's users the option
to leave a new message or see all the messages already
submitted (Figure 1).
Granted, this HTML is trivial, but critically, it
is stored separately from your code, which maintains the goal of the
MVC pattern.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10672f1.large.jpg"><img src="10672f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Index Request Handler Page
</p></div></div><p>
When users click the leave a comment link, a request routes
to <tt  >LeaveCommentHandler</tt>'s <tt  >get</tt>
method, which renders another
template called comment.html, which, again, resides in the
templates directory. Here's this template's HTML:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Leave a Comment&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
&lt;form action="/comment" method="POST"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter your e-mail address:
&lt;input type="text" name="c_email"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter your message (be nice):
&lt;textarea name="c_message" rows="5" cols="50"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="Submit" value="Submit your comment"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Again, this is standard HTML. A form is rendered to the screen (Figure 2),
and the form solicits an e-mail address and message from the user. Note the
names assigned to each interface element in the HTML. Also, note that the
form's action tag is directed back to the <tt  >/comment</tt> URL. When 
users submit the form, the data is posted to App Engine, which results
in the <tt  >post</tt> method executing within your
<tt  >LeaveCommentHandler</tt>
request handler. This code creates a new row of data from the submitted
data (note how the names match) and saves it to the datastore. The code
then redirects to the <tt  >/comments</tt> URL.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10672f2.large.jpg"><img src="10672f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Leave a Comment Form
</p></div></div><p>
When App Engine sees the <tt  >/comments</tt> request URL, it invokes the
<tt  >DisplayCommentsHandler</tt> request handler's
<tt  >get</tt> method, which
fetches 1,000 rows of data from the datastore and then sends the data to the
comments.html template for rendering. This final template looks
a bit more like a &ldquo;real&rdquo; template:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Here are the User Comments&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

{% for c in comments %}
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;{{ c.cust_email }}&lt;/b&gt; said:
    &lt;i&gt;"{{ c.cust_message }}"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
{% endfor %}

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
This is the final template that contains templating instructions, which are included to process
the data that the request handler sent to the template engine when the
template was invoked in your controller code. Anything enclosed within {%
and %} and within {{ and }} is template code; everything else is standard
HTML. App Engine's templating technology is based on Django's, which
is a popular Python-based Web application framework. Code found within
{% and %} is executed, whereas code found within {{ and }} is a value
substitution. This template takes the comment query results passed to
the template and displays each row within some custom HTML. The rendered
results are shown in Figure 3.

Testing Your webapp</h2></div></div><p>
Testing your application locally is complicated (only slightly) by having
to ensure that you use the correct version of Python, namely the 2.5
release. If you have been following along, you should have App Engine
installed in its own directory in your HOME directory, as well as your
webapp code in a directory called myapp. To start your webapp from
your HOME directory, open a shell and use this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
python2.5 google_appengine/dev_appserver.py myapp/
</pre>
</p><p>
A bunch of status messages will appear in the shell, and if all is well,
the development server will inform you that your webapp is up and running
on http://localhost:8080. Fire up your favorite browser, surf to your
webapp and give it a spin. You should see behaviors similar to those
shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1721580.0x18131e0"></a>
The Admin Interface</h2></div></div><p>
App Engine includes an administrator interface to your webapp that
can be accessed via the Web. To see it, point your browser at
http://localhost:8080/_ah/admin. Figure 4 shows the interface to the
datastore entries I created. The interface lets you
inspect and edit each of your entries in the datastore (as well as create
new ones). Each entry has been assigned
a unique Key and ID value by the datastore automatically. These values are often used
to retrieve a specific entry from the datastore.

Deployment</h2></div></div><p>
With your testing complete, you're ready for deployment. To do this,
follow the deployment instructions on the App Engine Web
site. This involves signing up for a Google ID (you already have one
if you use Gmail or Wave), selecting a unique name for your webapp
and requesting a seven-digit Google App Engine Code (which you need to
activate your webapp and which is sent by SMS to your cell phone). With
all of that in place, upload your code to Google's cloud from your HOME
directory using this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
google_appengin/appcfg.py update myapp/
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1721580.0x1813600"></a>
Learning More</h2></div></div><p>
Of course, it doesn't end there. App Engine has so much more, including
integration with Google's user management and login system, security
enhancements, memcached integration and validation technologies, among other things.
I recommend reading <span   class="emphasis"><em>Using Google App
Engine</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming Google App Engine</em></span>, both from O'Reilly
Media (see Resources). The former is an extended tutorial introduction to
App Engine using Python, and the latter is a reference that targets both
the Python and Java APIs. At the time of this writing, the other technical
publishers have App Engine books at an advanced stage of development
(most notably Manning). Apress also has a series of Google books. Another
project worth keeping an eye out for is the upcoming Google App Engine
video tutorials (again) from O'Reilly Media.

Is App Engine Really Free?</h2></div></div><p>
As I mentioned earlier, Google lets you get started with
App Engine for free. When your site becomes popular, Google asks you to pay
for the hosting services it provides. The busier your site, the more you
pay, and costs are pretty much in line with what you'd expect from a
reasonable-size ISP. If your site traffic remains
modest, you may never have to pay for App Engine's hosting service. But,
do you pay in other ways? Consider the following: once your code is
uploaded to App Engine, you can't retrieve it. You <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> update it,
but you had better keep a local copy as your own backup should you wish
to transfer the business logic you've embedded in your webapp to
another platform. Then, there's your data. It lives in the Google
cloud, and what that means really depends on whom you ask. App Engine keeps your data away from others, but you
are trusting Google to mind it for you.
</p><p>
App Engine is built on top of open-source Linux, with Python
and Java APIs, which also are both open technologies.
But, these facts alone do not make App Engine open. Far from it, this is
as vertically closed a system as Apple's iPad. Be aware of what
you are giving up when you decide to develop for this particular
&ldquo;free&rdquo; Google platform.
If you're okay with vendor lock-in, and if you trust Google with
your data and your application, Google App Engine may be for you.
