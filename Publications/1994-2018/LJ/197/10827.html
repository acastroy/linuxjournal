Rant</h4><p>
I just read Dave Taylor's column &ldquo;Simple Scripts to Sophisticated
HTML Forms, Take II&rdquo;
in the July 2010 issue. I don't know how to ask this nicely, so I'll just ask
it. If you're writing for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, why are you writing your scripts on
Apple OS X and not a Linux distribution? If you don't want to use Linux as
your primary OS, that's fine, but at least do us the service of firing up a
virtual machine with Linux.
Otherwise, great series.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Jason Froebe  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span> A fair question! I have long ago ascertained,
however, that from a command-line perspective, any *nix that is
POSIX-compliant is going to be functionally identical. Although I
certainly can&mdash;and have in the past&mdash;install a variety of different Linuxes on my
computers, I instead test with the NetBSD-based Mac command line that's part
of Mac OS X and double-check on the FreeBSD server I have running my main Web
sites. Are they Linux systems, per se? No. Does it matter? I don't think
so. What do you think?

Thanks for the Nokia N900 Review</h4><p>
I was so impressed with the review Kyle Rankin wrote about the N900
that I jumped onto the Web and started reading about this wonderful product
(see the May 2010 issue).
The more things I read about it, the more I wanted it. So now thanks to Kyle
Rankin,
I own one. FYI, the latest update helped the GPS a lot. Also, there
is now a turn-by-turn navigation app, Mobile Maps. It's $49.99 euros, and
around $61 US. Thank you Kyle Rankin!!

Kudos for &ldquo;Adventures in Scanning&rdquo;</h4><p>
Thank goodness for Dirk Elmendorf's &ldquo;Adventures in Scanning&rdquo;
in the June 2010 issue. Like Dirk, I too, have shied away for quite some time from
scanners in Linux, and especially multifunction devices. However, I'd been
thinking more and more about moving on from my plain-vanilla laser printer,
but well, I was still chicken-hearted. Dirk's column has helped bolster my courage
a lot! Multifunction printers, onward!

Using Telnet to Send E-mail</h4><p>
Regarding Torsten's Letter and Kyle Rankin's reply in the July 2010 issue, note
that the actual SMTP RFC is
RFC-5321 and not 2821. It was updated in 2008. See

Plone</h4><p>
I would like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> to print an article on
Plone, because one, you
haven't printed anything on it, and two, I would like more people to know
about it. Also, I bought the June issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> at Barnes &amp; Noble, and I am
thinking about subscribing to it. Although I am 11, I learned lots about why
there are so many distributions and how they are so different. I use
Linux Mint 9.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Stephen McIntosh  <br><br>
</p><p>
It has been a while since we've had articles on Plone in the magazine, but
if you check out our Web site, you'll find some articles from past issues.
I'm glad you enjoyed the June issue, and hope we continue to entertain and
inform you. Be sure to check out our Web site too, there are many Web-only
topics that come out quite regularly. Welcome to the family!&mdash;Ed.

Thanks for the <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> Archive CD</h4><p>
I have been a subscriber for so long I can't remember, and I've kept all my
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>
magazines. Unfortunately, due to the preparation of renovating my parent's
house and me moving into a smaller apartment, I have no space for my
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>
collection (amongst other things). I had to, in one fell swoop, throw out
all my magazines. Thankfully, you guys came out with the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> CD. Now I can
read all the magazines even if I no longer own the printed copies.
In any event, thank you very much for <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>. I love it. Keep up the great
work!

GASP! Seriously though, my wife often asks why I keep multiple copies of
each <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> issue, and my response is usually something deep and
meaningful like, &ldquo;Because!&rdquo; She's seldom impressed. Still, I understand
your pain, and I'm glad the CD helps soothe the burn a bit. Thanks for
kind letter.&mdash;Ed.

Maintaining Automatically Generated Files</h4><p>
In the June 2010 Hack and / column, Kyle Rankin presents a possible
nightmare to the next sysadmin after him. The script automatically
generates a config file, complete with comments that say &ldquo;add any extra
munin options for each host here&rdquo;. When run in a cron.daily fashion,
however, this means someone else may happen across the config file,
change it, and then be perplexed the next day as the changes vanished.
</p><p>
Anything that is auto-generated should have such comments replaced with a
header comment indicating that it is generated automatically, the source
of the generation and a timestamp. Help out the next poor guy who
inherits the system (or even yourself), as a year later, you might not
remember what you did.

The Future of Linux: the Average Windows User</h4><p>
An open letter to the Linux community:
</p><p>
I consider myself the above-average Windows user. I've taken and passed A+
Certification and some Windows networking courses. I have a basic, big-picture understanding of the DOS command line and Windows. I don't like
anyone,
such as Windows or Google, monopolizing control over their clients, so when
Linux came along in the 1990s, I wanted it to succeed. I have loved the
idea of a free computer operating system for everyone that Linux brought to
us. When I say free, I mean freedom from being controlled by Microsoft or
its
peers. I don't mind paying for an OS that offers freedom from control. So
I attempted to use the Red Hat distribution around 2000 to no avail. Now,
ten years later, I'm at it again with Ubuntu. I love it. There are so many
aspects to Ubuntu that I like better than Windows. One is that there is so
much free software for nearly anything you need/want to accomplish. The
problem I see is the fact that many hardware devices and software are not
compatible.
</p><p>
If Linux is to make headway into the individual consumer market, these
compatibility issues <span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be overcome. I would like to ditch
Windows totally, but at the present time, this isn't feasible. I have listed some of
the current obstacles that I see and objectives the Linux community needs to
work toward for it to be viable to the masses:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Compatibility with <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> Linux software and hardware
devices, no matter
what Linux distribution the consumer is using.
The Linux community needs to reach out as one body to hardware and
software manufacturers with uniform standards that apply, no matter what
distribution is being used. This leads to the next item. 
</p></li><li><p>
The various
distributions <span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> tear down the walls between their peers and work together
for the common good, which is Linux for all.
</p></li><li><p>
A 100% GUI interface with no need for using the terminal, unless the user
would like to use it specifically. This, I believe, is the major
obstacle we have to scale over together, and it's especially needed for
installation.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I hope this gives the Linux community some ideas on how to make Linux better
for and easily used by the nontechnical, common user.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Christian   <br><br>
</p><p>
Thank you for your letter. I love to see people share my passion for free
and open software. Although I largely agree with your points, one of the unavoidable consequences of freedom is the freedom everyone has to do things differently.
</p><p>
I wish there were a common packaging system (I'd pick .deb myself). I wish
there were a common GUI interface. I wish there were common configuration
tools. I fear, however, that if we &ldquo;forced&rdquo; compliance to standards, we'd
lose the very freedom we love. It's a wickedly double-edged sword, and I'm
not sure I can come up with an ideal answer. Hopefully, your letter and my
response will get people thinking about such things.&mdash;Ed.

Friends Don't Let Friends Use Windows</h4><p>
My home is 100% Microsoft-free. My primary desktop runs Mint-9-amd64, my old
laptop runs Ubuntu 9.04, and my Dell Mini 9 Netbook runs Xubuntu 9.10. I have
tried many other distros, but I like these the best. I have a friend who
wants to switch to Linux and even tinkers with Ubuntu 10.04 within VMware on
his Windows 7 machine, but he just can't make the switch, mostly due to a
dependence upon one specific Windows application, but I also suspect it's a
healthy fear of the unknown.
</p><p>
I recently invited this friend to join me at an upcoming local Linuxfest, but
he declined due to schedule conflicts. I fear that he will never make a
&ldquo;cold-turkey&rdquo; switch to Linux, so I gave him the advice below.
I'm 
sharing it in this message because other readers may find it useful for helping
struggling converts (the rest of the letter is the advice to my friend).
</p><p>
I went back and forth between Windows and Linux over the years. Each time I
was driven back to Windows because of a perception that some critical
application existed only in Windows and frustration when some things seemed
to be harder to do in Linux. Over time, I gradually switched to Windows
versions of many of the open-source packages used in Linux and discovered
that, with the familiarity of use, I grew comfortable with the open-source
applications, such as OpenOffice.org, GIMP, Gramps, GnuCash and Scribus and
so on. At
some point, I realized I wasn't using Windows for anything but a
program launcher for open-source software and that there was really no reason
to continue to use Windows. At that point, I switched 100% to Linux and left
Microsoft behind forever.
</p><p>
If you really would like to abandon Microsoft, I recommend following a
similar path. Start using multiplatform open-source equivalents of your
current programs, and after a period of acclimation, you too will realize that
you don't really need Microsoft Windows anymore.
</p><p>
Start with OpenOffice.org. It is as good as Microsoft Office, just a little
different here and there. The learning curve is not steep, and it's worth the
effort. After OpenOffice.org, switch, one at a time, to other open-source solutions.
First, read this:

Great advice! Switching to open-source alternatives is a great way to make
the transition. Also, your link supplies great information. Thanks!&mdash;Ed.

Rockbox <span   class="emphasis"><em>Isn't</em></span> Linux!</h4><p>
I thought I'd better drop a note in case no one else offers a
correction to Dan Sawyer's assertion in his &ldquo;Philosophy and
Fancy&rdquo; article in
the June 2010 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>. He says at one point:
&ldquo;No discussion of the different approaches would be complete without
mentioning embedded distributions&mdash;versions of Linux and derivative
operating systems (such as Rockbox and Android) designed to run on
handheld devices, in networking appliances, NAS servers and dozens of other
gadgets, toys, tools and machines that consumers love to use and hackers
love to repurpose.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Unfortunately, Dan makes a mistake that for some reason a lot of people do, 
which is that Rockbox is in some way based on Linux. It's not&mdash;not even
remotely. The kernel has been written entirely from scratch, and we don't
ship a &ldquo;distribution&rdquo; either. We include no GNU tools as they'd be
recognized by the GNU Project. (And I say that merely because I can't think
of <span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> that we ship, but I don't want to claim something that later turns
out to be slightly untrue!) I imagine Mr Torvalds would be quite insulted if
he ever found out people were of the opinion that he'd written it! About the
only thing it has in common with Linux is that it's vaguely POSIX (although
not nearly as much as Linux itself is these days).
</p><p>
We at the Rockbox Project are constantly flummoxed at the number of people
who seem convinced that Rockbox is based on Linux. We've certainly never
said it is! Indeed, if Dan can point us to the source of his own confusion
on this matter, we'd love to set whomever straight too!
</p><p>
Other than that, the article was an interesting read, and I thank Dan for the rest of
the time he invested in writing it!

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Bryan   <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dan Sawyer replies:</b></span>
You are, of course, correct about Rockbox. In my tracing of
philosophical links and the cross-fertilization among open-source
projects, I failed to portray the situation accurately.
Thanks very much for the note!

Dynamic nmap + xymon</h4><p>
Great Hack and / article by Kyle Rankin in the June 2010 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> covering the grepable
output function of nmap and culminating in your own dynamic configuration file for
Munin. What's so cool about this is it's 1) simple, 2) easy and, most
important, 3) brilliantly easy and simple!
</p><p>
I've actually borrowed your idea to do the same thing on the networks I
administer at work using xymon (<a href="http://www.xymon.com/hobbit/help/about.html" target="_self">www.xymon.com/hobbit/help/about.html</a>).
</p><p>
You know as well as I, there can be <span   class="emphasis"><em>a lot</em></span> of steps
involved in getting servers
deployed in any environment (even when it's highly automated), but I sincerely
dig shortcut ideas like this to make my life a bit easier in the system
administration realm.
</p><p>
Keep the cool tips coming, friend!
