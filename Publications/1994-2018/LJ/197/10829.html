<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #197, September 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Some new documentation is available for <span   class="bold"><b>SysFS</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>libudev</b></span>.
<span   class="bold"><b>Alan Ott</b></span>
couldn't find the docs he wanted, so he wrote some of his own and put
them up at <a href="http://www.signal11.us/oss/udev" target="_self">www.signal11.us/oss/udev</a>. The relationship between
those tools is that SysFS presents a filesystem interface to view
kernel and hardware status and to edit configuration options, while
libudev presents a C library to track SysFS's changes and to modify
the various configuration options. Through the years, a
lot of attempts have been made to create a consistent interface to present hardware
and kernel options to the user. SysFS is one of the most recent, and
it seems to be the one that is gradually taking over from <span   class="bold"><b>ProcFS</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>ioctls</b></span>
and all the older mechanisms.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jesse Barnes</b></span> has been trying to give
<span   class="bold"><b>kernel panics</b></span> a better chance of
presenting screen output when the user has been running the <span   class="bold"><b>X
Window System</b></span>. Typically, running X means a panic just won't produce
visible output, which in turn means that a meaningful bug report is
much harder to create. Jesse's code improves the situation in some
cases, but if X has disabled the display, his patch still won't cause
panic output to appear on the screen. There was not much immediate
interest displayed in his patches, which could mean that <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>David S. Miller</b></span> just haven't had a chance to look at them
yet, or it could mean they think he's on the wrong track. It's cool
that someone's looking into better panic output though.
</p><p>
The old <span   class="bold"><b>GCC 3.x compiler</b></span> is having more and more trouble compiling the
Linux kernel, and folks like <span   class="bold"><b>H. Peter
Anvin</b></span> are getting less and less
enthused about fixing all those problems as they turn up. Recently,
there was talk about just dumping support for that compiler, at least
for the x86 platform. It seems clear that very few people still use
GCC 3.x to compile current Linux releases, although there probably
are some. But, even as one group of developers moved more in the direction
of deprecating GCC 3.x and eventually abandoning support for it,
another group of developers seemed to gain interest in preserving
support for GCC 3.x. As <span   class="bold"><b>Eric Dumazet</b></span> put it, if there's no significant
technical reason to drop support, the mere fact of GCC 3.x being
&ldquo;old&rdquo; didn't seem like a good enough reason, especially as the work
involved in maintaining support was not so extreme.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>TmpFS</b></span> has a speed issue, because if multiple threads try to access a
mounted TmpFS filesystem, they run into so much lock contention that
the filesystem slows down considerably. <span   class="bold"><b>Tim
Chen</b></span> and various other
folks implemented a &ldquo;token jar&rdquo; to handle the lock contention in
TmpFS and saw 270% speed increases on some of their tests. <span   class="bold"><b>Andi Kleen</b></span>
liked the patches and said their token-jar implementation might also
be useful elsewhere in the kernel. So, it looks like upcoming kernels
will include a much faster TmpFS.

<h2 class="title">Don't Buy Candy from the Car Salesman</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #197, September 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
If you want to find double-chocolate truffle, chances are you would shop
at a place that specializes in making candy. Sure, the used-car salesman
might have a jar of cheap candies he's giving away, but for serious
chocolate-lovers, nothing compares to confections made by experts.
The same thing is true with computer equipment. No, there aren't free
jars of server blades at the used-car lot, but when you buy hardware
or software, you want to buy it from someone who specializes in your
operating system&mdash;in our case, Linux.
</p><p>
Over at the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Web site, our very own Joe Krack keeps a handy
database of vendors, systems and even sales promotions from Linux-friendly companies. They are vendors we've personally worked with,
and they offer deals unique to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> readers. It's not a big
list of advertisements; rather, it's a big list of products from companies
we trust. Check it out over at <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/buyersguide" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/buyersguide</a>.
To be fair, I wouldn't recommend buying candy from them either.
The &ldquo;chips&rdquo; they sell aren't chocolate chips.

<h2 class="title">The Web on the Console</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #197, September 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Most people think &ldquo;graphical interfaces&rdquo; when they think of surfing the
Web. And, under X11, there are lots of great programs, like Firefox or
Chrome. But, the console isn't the wasteland it might seem. 
Lots of utilities are available for surfing the Web and also for
downloading or uploading content.
</p><p>
Let's say you want to surf the Web and find
some content. The first utility to look at is also one of the oldest,
the venerable Lynx. Lynx actually was my first Web browser, running on
a machine that couldn't handle X11. In its most basic form, you
simply run it on the command line and give it a filename or a URL. So,
if you wanted to hit Google, you would run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
lynx http://www.google.com
</pre>
</p><p>
Lynx then asks you whether you want
to accept a cookie Google is trying to set. Once you either accept
or reject the cookie, Lynx loads the Web page and renders it. As you
will no doubt notice, there are no images. But, all the links and the
text box for entering search queries are there. You 
can navigate from link to link with the arrow keys. Because the
layout is very simple and text-based, items are in very different
locations on the screen from what you would see when using a graphical browser.
</p><p>
Several options to Lynx might be handy to know. 
You can hand in more than one URL when you launch
Lynx. Lynx adds all of those URLs to the history of your session
and renders the last URL and displays it. When you tested loading Google
above, Lynx asked about whether or not to accept a cookie. Most sites
these days use cookies, so you may not want to hear about every cookie. 
Use the option <tt  >-accept_all_cookies</tt> to avoid those warning
messages. You can use Lynx to process Web pages into a readable form with
the option <tt  >-dump</tt>, which takes the rendered output from Lynx and
writes it to standard out. This way, you can process Web pages
to a readable format and dump them into a file for later viewing. You
can choose what kind of key mapping to use with the options
<tt  >-vikeys</tt> or <tt  >-emacskeys</tt>, so
shortcut keys will match your editor of choice.
</p><p>
Lynx does have a few issues. It has a hard time with HTML table rendering,
and it doesn't handle frames. So, let's look at the Links browser. Links not only
works in text mode on the command line, but it also can be compiled to use
a graphics display. The graphics systems supported include X11, SVGA
and framebuffer. You can select one of these graphics interfaces with the
option <tt  >-g</tt>. Links also can write the rendered Web pages to standard
output with the <tt  >-dump</tt> option. If you need to use a proxy, 
tell Links which to use with the option <tt  >-http-proxy
host:port</tt>. Links 
also is able to deal with buggy Web servers. Several Web servers
claim to be compliant with a particular HTTP version but
aren't. To compensate for this, use the
<tt  >-http-bugs.*</tt>
options. For example, <tt  >-http-bugs.http10 1</tt> forces Links to use HTTP 1.0,
even when a server claims to support HTTP 1.1.
</p><p>
If you are looking for a strictly text replacement for the venerable
Lynx, there is ELinks. ELinks supports colors, table rendering, frames,
background downloading and tabbed browsing. One possibly useful option is
<tt  >-anonymous 1</tt>. This option disables local file browsing and downloads,
among other things. Another interesting option is
<tt  >-lookup</tt>. When you
use this, ELinks prints out all the resolved IP addresses for a
given domain name.
</p><p>
Now that you can look at Web content from the command line, how can
you interact with the Web? What I really mean is, how do you upload and
download from the Web? Say you want an
off-line copy of some content from the Web, so you can read it
at your leisure by the lake where you don't have Internet
access. You can use curl to do that. curl can
transfer data to or from a server on the Internet using HTTP, FTP,
SFTP and even LDAP. It can do things like HTTP POST, SSL connections and
cookies. You can specify form name/value pairs so that the Web server
thinks you are submitting a form by using the option <tt  >-F
name=value</tt>. One
really interesting option is the ability to use multiple URLs through
ranges. For example, you can specify multiple hosts with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
curl http://site.{one,two,three}.com
</pre>
</p><p>
which hits all three sites. You can go through alphanumeric ranges
with square brackets. The command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
curl http://www.site.com/text[1-10].html
</pre>
</p><p>
downloads the files text1.html to text10.html.
</p><p>
What if you want a copy of an entire site for off-line browsing? The
wget tool can help here. In this case, you likely will want to
use the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
wget -k -r -p http://www.site.com
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >-r</tt> option recurses through the site's links starting at
http://www.site.com/index.html. The <tt  >-k</tt> option rewrites the downloaded
files so that links from page to page are all relative, allowing you to 
navigate correctly through the downloaded pages. The 
<tt  >-p</tt> option
downloads all extra content on the page, such as images. This way, you
can get a mirror of a site on your desktop. wget also handles proxies,
cookies and HTTP authentication, along with many other conditions. 
</p><p>
If you're
uploading content to the Web, use wput. wput pushes content up
using FTP, with an interface like wget.
</p><p>
Now you should be able to interact with the Internet without ever
having to use a graphical interface&mdash;yet another reason to keep you on
the command line.

Hardly a day goes by without the need to compress or uncompress something.
And, plenty of compression/decompression programs exist, but
if you like the idea of using the same tool on multiple platforms and you
like open source, you should consider PeaZip. PeaZip runs on Windows
and Linux, and because it's written with Free Pascal and Lazarus, the Linux
version comes in both a GTK2 (GNOME) flavor and a Qt (KDE) flavor.
</p><p>
PeaZip can create the standard types of compressed files/archives:
ZIP, GZ and 7Z. Plus, it creates a few that you don't often see in a
desktop GUI tool: BZ2 and TAR. In addition, it creates ARC, PAQ/ZPAQ,
PEA, QUAD/BALZ and UPX files/archives. On the decompression side, PeaZip
goes ballistic and handles (currently) 123 different archive/file types.
In other words, if it's compressed/archived, it's unlikely that PeaZip
won't be able to deal with it.
</p><p>
PeaZip is hosted on SourceForge at <a href="http://peazip.sourceforge.net" target="_self">peazip.sourceforge.net</a>.
There are installers for Windows (32- and 64-bit).
There also are RPMs and DEBs for Linux/GTK2 or Linux/Qt.
And, if you're a Lazarus type, you can grab the source.
PeaZip also provides localizations for dozens of other languages.

<h2 class="title">LUG Startup Kit</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #197, September 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I live in a very remote area, and the closest active LUG is a several-hour
drive away. I figure my situation isn't unique, so while
I begin to form a LUG in my area, I thought it would be nice to share
some quick tips I've gathered about doing so (mostly from Kyle Rankin,
a friend and president of the North Bay Linux Users Group, <a href="http://www.nblug.org" target="_self">www.nblug.org</a>).
Here's my quick list of things to gather when forming a Linux Users Group:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
People: this might seem obvious, but in all the preparations, it's
easy to forget that you need at least a half-dozen people or so who are
willing to show up regularly.
</p></li><li><p>
Regular time and place: most LUGs meet monthly. There is no
rule about this, but monthly meetings seem to be a good regularity, making the LUG
feel dedicated, yet occuring not so often that finding speakers (my next bullet
point) becomes difficult. If possible, keep a standard meeting place as well.
That way, if people miss a meeting, they don't show up at the wrong
place next time.
</p></li><li><p>
A reason to come: socializing is great, but having a speaker,
a demonstration, a Skype interview or anything unique to gatherings
is essential. Why would we leave the comfort of our La-Z-Boy recliners
when we could just banter in an IRC channel? Make it worthwhile to put
on pants.
</p></li><li><p>
Refreshments: this might be just water, or it might be water and
coffee. Perhaps you have donuts. The important thing is for people to
have something to hold in their hands, especially during the socialization
time of the meeting. Many of us are introverts, and standing in a room
full of other introverts is difficult. Put a cup of coffee in people's
hands, however, and they have something to do. They're no longer standing
awkwardly; they're drinking coffee. Trust me, it helps.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Really, that's about it. If you are starting the LUG, you'll likely
need to stand up and talk for a few minutes to welcome everyone and
introduce your special guest/video/event. After an hour or hour and a
half (try to stick to your scheduled time), you can adjourn the meeting.
You're done; you started a LUG.
</p><p>
From there, many other options exist. Most LUGs have a Web site with
information about their meetings. Some LUGers 
go to a bar after the meeting is over. (Many people don't drink alcohol,
so don't make it part of your LUG meeting to go for drinks.) Some LUGs
host installfests, hackfests or gaming parties. There really aren't 
any rules for what your group should do. It's a rather open concept.
And, if you're in Northern Michigan any time after fall 2010, check
out NOMLUG (<a href="http://www.nomlug.org" target="_self">www.nomlug.org</a>). Hopefully, we'll be meeting regularly by
then!

<h2 class="title">Cloudy Tech Tips</h2>

One of the things I love about the Linux community is how willing to
share knowledge everyone tends to be. Whether it's a software suggestion,
hardware review or just a quick tech tip, we love to share. Most of
the tech tips we receive here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> are
command-line tips.
Those are great, but what about all those Web tools you might use?
Just because a Web-based tip might work for more than only Linux doesn't
mean it's not a great tip.
</p><p>
For example, I love the STEEP.IT Web site. Like the
old tea-timer
applications we have used in the past, this simple Web-based application
helps me get perfect green tea instead of over-steeped yuckiness.
Just visit <a href="http://steep.it/green" target="_self">steep.it/green</a>, and the counter starts for a perfect
cup of green tea.
</p><p>
Do you have any handy tech tips you'd like to share? They can be
Web-based, GUI-based, command-line-based, or even just tips like,
&ldquo;don't eat yellow snow&rdquo;. Send your tech tips to
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>, and if we print your submission in the magazine,
we'll send you a free T-shirt! Be warned, however, it's very unlikely
we'll print any tips about eating colored snow.

To be a nemesis, you have to actively try to destroy something, don't you?
Really, I'm not out to destroy Microsoft. That will just be a completely
unintentional side effect.

Since this issue focuses on Web development, I'd like to take the
opportunity to provide a glimpse behind the scenes at
LinuxJournal.com. Many of you already know that LinuxJournal.com is
largely made possible by the Drupal platform, aka my favorite open-source
project. Many also have asked to learn more about the
specifics of our Drupal setup, and to that end, I'd like to share 
some of my favorite Drupal modules that power LinuxJournal.com:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Views: this one is pretty obvious to anyone who has used Drupal at
all, but stating the obvious never hurts anyone. Views is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span>
absolutely essential query-building module. In my opinion, you cannot
build a Drupal site without this module (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/views" target="_self">drupal.org/project/views</a>).
</p></li><li><p>
CCK: again, I state the obvious, but the content construction kit
allows you to add fields to content, allowing you to build custom types
of content for almost any data imaginable. I can't imagine a Drupal
world without CCK (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/cck" target="_self">drupal.org/project/cck</a>).
</p></li><li><p>
Flag: the Flag module is brilliant in its simplicity&mdash;a simple
yes or no, on or off, 1 or 0 to almost anything on your Drupal site.
The possibilities are endless (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/flag" target="_self">drupal.org/project/flag</a>).
</p></li><li><p>
Views Attach: what could be better than attaching a list of data
to a user or individual piece of content? In my experience, the answer
to &ldquo;How do I display ____?&rdquo; frequently involves Views Attach. I
highly recommend giving this little module a spin to see if it works
for you (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/views_attach" target="_self">drupal.org/project/views_attach</a>).
</p></li><li><p>
Mollom: last, but certainly not least, Mollom is the module that
keeps me relatively sane. Spam makes LinuxJournal.com less cool, and
must, therefore, be destroyed. I hate spam. Mollom gets rid of spam
Thanks, Mollom (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/mollom" target="_self">drupal.org/project/mollom</a>)! 
</p></li></ol></div><p>
These five modules are some of my favorites, but there are lots more
where they came from, so I hope you'll visit LinuxJournal.com to read
more about these and other great modules, as well as other tidbits
from my adventures in Drupaling. Just go to LinuxJournal.com and
search &ldquo;Drupal&rdquo;. See you there!
