Need a personal firewall, an enterprise Internet gateway or something
in between? iptables does it all!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x2769450"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The Linux kernel includes some of the most powerful and flexible
firewall code in any general-purpose operating system. This code is
called Netfilter, though most of us refer to it by the name of its
user-space command, iptables. Netfilter/iptables allows your Linux
kernel to inspect all network traffic that passes through your system,
deciding what to do with that traffic based on a very rich set of criteria.
</p><p>
Building Linux firewalls with iptables is a big topic&mdash;entire books have
been written about it (see Resources). In fact, firewall engineering
is a profession unto itself (my profession, in fact). So, alas, nobody
can tell you everything you need to know about building firewalls with
iptables in one magazine article.
</p><p>
I can, however, provide an overview of the things iptables
can do, some sound principles for Linux firewall design, descriptions
of some handy tools for building different types of Linux firewalls
and pointers to more detailed information on Linux firewalls.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x2769608"></a>
Types of Linux Firewalls</h2></div></div><p>
Firewalling, or more precisely, packet filtering, can be used for many
things. It can be used locally on individual servers and desktop systems
for host-level protection from network-based attacks. It can be used at
the network infrastructure level to protect entire networks from other
networks, and it can be used to redirect, or even alter, network packets
in various ways.
</p><p>
A Linux firewall can be a dedicated hardware appliance based on Linux,
a PC with multiple network interfaces, or it even can be an ordinary,
single-interfaced workstation or server. Many commercial firewall
appliances are Linux/iptables-based. Contrary to what you might think,
PC-based Linux firewalls can perform and scale quite well,
if deployed on sufficiently powerful hardware.
</p><p>
Those are the form factors Linux firewalls take, and they serve in two different
roles. Firewall appliances and multi-interface PC-based
firewalls are used as what I call network firewalls. They serve as
dedicated network devices, logically equivalent to IP routers that
regulate traffic between different networks. (Technically, firewalls
<span   class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> routers; they're just fussier about what they route than
ordinary routers.) Network firewalls also often perform Network Address
Translation (NAT), typically to allow hosts with non-Internet-routable
IP addresses to communicate with the Internet.
</p><p>
Then, there are what I call local firewalls&mdash;workstations or servers
whose primary function isn't firewalling at all, but the need to protect
themselves. In my opinion, <span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> computer connected to the Internet,
whether server or workstation, should run a local firewall
policy. In
the case of Linux systems, we have no excuse for not taking advantage of
Linux's built-in Netfilter/iptables functionality. Furthermore, this
is the easiest type of firewall script to create, as I show later in
this article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x2769920"></a>
Firewall Design Principles</h2></div></div><p>
Before we discuss Linux firewall tools, we should cover some general
firewall design principles. Most of these principles are (or should be)
equally valid whether you're using iptables to protect a single host or
entire networks.
</p><p>
First, here are some terms:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Packet filtering: the practice of inspecting
individual network packets, comparing against a set of rules and
processing them accordingly.
</p></li><li><p>
Firewall policy: either a
specific set of iptables commands or a higher-level set of design
goals that your iptables commands enforce.
</p></li><li><p>
Firewall rules or
packet-filtering rules: the individual components of a firewall
policy&mdash;that is, individual iptables command iterations.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The first step in building any set of packet-filtering rules is to decide
precisely what you want your firewall to do&mdash;that is, to formulate your
high-level firewall policy. For example, if I'm creating a local firewall
script for a workstation, my logical policy might look like this:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Allow outbound DNS queries, Web surfing via HTTP and HTTPS, e-mail
retrieval via IMAP, outbound SSH and outbound FTP transactions from
the local system to the entire outside world.
</p></li><li><p>
Allow inbound SSH connections to this system from the other workstation
in my basement.
</p></li><li><p>
Block everything else.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Skipping this crucial step of defining your high-level policy is akin to
writing a software application without first defining requirements. You
run the risk of wasting time on rules you don't need and of overlooking
rules that you do need.
</p><p>
I further recommend that whatever policy you decide on, you make it
<span   class="emphasis"><em>as
restrictive as is feasible</em></span>. Marcus Ranum very succinctly stated the
guiding principle for firewall design many years ago: &ldquo;that which is not
expressly permitted is forbidden&rdquo;. The reason for this is quite
simple; just because you can't think of how an allowed but unnecessary network
transaction can't be abused, doesn't mean some attacker can't abuse
it nonetheless.
</p><p>
Every firewall policy, therefore, must logically end with a rule that
blocks everything not specified earlier.
</p><p>
This is true not only for network/enterprise firewall policies, but
also of personal/local firewall policies. A common blunder on personal
firewalls is to allow all &ldquo;outbound&rdquo; transactions, on the assumption
that all local processes are &ldquo;trusted&rdquo;. If your system is infected with
a worm, trojan or virus, however, this assumption breaks down.
</p><p>
In the event of such an infection, you probably don't want the malware
to be able to use your system to send spam, participate in distributed
denial-of-service attacks and so forth. Therefore, it's preferable to restrict
not only &ldquo;inbound&rdquo; (externally originated) network transactions, but
also outbound (internally/locally originated) transactions, even on the
local firewall policies of desktop systems and servers.
</p><p>
Another important firewall design principle is, whenever possible,
to group similar risks together. In other words, systems and networks
with different levels of trust and different levels of exposure to risk
should be isolated from each other by network firewalls.
</p><p>
The classic example of this principle in action is the DMZ
or de-militarized zone, which is a network containing all of an
organization's Internet-accessible systems. Figure 1 shows the
relationship between such a DMZ: the &ldquo;internal&rdquo; network containing an
organization's workgroups and other non-public-facing network resources
and the Internet.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9569f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. A DMZ Network
</p></div></div><p>
With firewalls separating the DMZ network from both the Internet and the
internal (trusted) network, you can write rules that specify, in a
very granular way, how hosts in these three zones can interact with each
other. In formulating such rules, you should assume that, being exposed
to a nearly infinite range of possible attackers (via the Internet), the
hosts in your DMZ should be treated as semi-trusted at best&mdash;that is,
you should assume that any host in the DMZ may be compromised at some
point. Accordingly, you should allow as few transactions as possible to
be initiated from the DMZ to the internal network.
</p><p>
You also should take into consideration the threat a compromised DMZ host
could pose to the outside world. If an Internet-based attacker compromises
your DNS server, for example, even if the attacker's attempts to hack
into your internal network are blocked by firewall rules, that attacker
can still cause your organization embarrassment or even legal problems
if the compromised server is able to connect arbitrarily (that is,
attack) to other systems on the Internet. I can't state this often or
strongly enough: firewall policies should allow only the bare minimum set
of network transactions necessary for your users and systems to do their
jobs. Unnecessary dataflows can <span   class="emphasis"><em>and will</em></span> be abused, sooner or later.
</p><p>
You probably noticed that in Figure 1, two firewalls are used. This is
the classic firewall sandwich DMZ architecture, but many organizations
opt instead for a more economical multi-homed-firewall DMZ architecture
(Figure 2), in which a single firewall with multiple network interfaces
interconnects and restricts traffic between different networks. Although
the sandwich topology provides greater protection against, for example,
the external firewall itself being compromised in some way (assuming
the other firewall isn't subject to the exact same vulnerability),
the multi-homed-firewall approach can be equally effective, so long as
you write your rules carefully enough.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9569f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. A DMZ and a Multi-Homed Firewall
</p></div></div><p>
Also, regardless of whether you use a single multi-homed firewall or
pairs of firewalls, it's extremely important that each network zone
(inside, outside/Internet and DMZ) be connected to a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>dedicated</em></span>
physical network interface on a firewall. Yes, this does make your
firewall a potential single point of failure. However, if it's possible
for hosts in one network zone to route packets to other network zones
without traversing the firewall, your firewall will have little practical
value!
</p><p>
The last general firewall design principle I mention for now applies
only to multi-interface firewalls (that is, not to local/personal
firewalls): always use anti-spoofing rules.
</p><p>
Consider the Internet-facing firewall in Figure 1. It has two network
interfaces: inside (which faces the DMZ) and outside (which faces
the Internet). Suppose that the internal network in Figure 1 uses IP
addresses in the Class C network space 192.168.55.0/24, and the DMZ
uses 192.168.77.0/24.
</p><p>
This firewall therefore can and should drop any packets arriving on
its Internet interface having source IP addresses from either of those
two private IP ranges. Such packets safely can be assumed to be forged
(spoofed). Attackers sometimes forge the source IP addresses of their
packets, attempting to pass them through firewalls or to defeat other
source-IP-based authentication mechanisms (TCPwrappers, hosts.equiv and
so on).
</p><p>
In fact, <span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> Internet-facing network interface on
<span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span>
firewall should drop packets with source IP addresses from
<span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span>
non-Internet-routable IP range, specifically those specified in RFC 1918:
10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12 and 192.168.0.0/16. (If these numbers, which
are ranges of IP addresses expressed in CIDR notation, confuse you,
don't panic! Some of the iptables tools discussed later in this article
assume no particular networking expertise.)
</p><p>
To express this important firewall design principle even more generally:
you should configure your firewall to drop any packet bearing an
impossible source IP address.
</p><p>
Those are some things all firewalls should do. Now, how do we make them
do those things?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x2b62fb8"></a>
Firewall Tools for Linux</h2></div></div><p>
All Linux firewalls work the same way. A series of iptables commands are
executed in sequence to load firewall rules into kernel memory space. All
packets entering all network interfaces are then evaluated by the kernel
based on these rules and handled accordingly. These rules are organized
in tables (formerly, and still occasionally, called chains). Rules
can be inserted, appended, changed and deleted from any table at any time
via the iptables command and take effect immediately.
</p><p>
The most direct way to create a Linux firewall policy is to write an
iptables startup script from scratch and then manage it like any
other startup script in init.d. This is how I manage my own Linux
firewalls, and it works fine if you understand networking,
you're comfortable with the iptables command, and you don't have
many different firewalls to manage or more than a couple of different
policies on any given firewall.
</p><p>
To learn how to roll your own iptables scripts, refer
to the Resources for this article. As I said previously, I simply can't do that topic
justice here. (Note that different Linux distributions handle startup
scripts differently.) If you want to harness the full power of iptables,
including NAT, custom chains and packet-mangling, this really is the
best way to go.
</p><p>
Assuming you can't, or don't, want to write iptables scripts directly,
here are some pointers to tools that can help.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x2b631c8"></a>
Personal (Local) Firewalls</h2></div></div><p>
The first category of iptables tools I dicuss here probably already
exists on your system. Nowadays, nearly all Linux distributions include
a firewall wizard in their installation utilities. Nearly always, this
wizard is intended for creating a local firewall policy&mdash;that is, a
personal firewall script, which protects only the local host.
</p><p>
These wizards all work the same way. They ask you which local services
you want to allow external hosts to reach, if any. For example, if
I'm installing Linux on an SMTP e-mail server, I would allow inbound
connections only to TCP port 25 (SMTP), though possibly also to TCP port
22 (Secure Shell, which I may need for remote administration).
</p><p>
Based on your response, the wizard then creates a startup script
containing iptables commands that allow incoming requests
to the services/ports you specified, block all other inbound
(externally originating) transactions and allow all outbound
(locally originating) network transactions.
</p><p>
But wait! That third command violates Ranum's principle (deny all that is not
explicitly permitted), doesn't it? Yes, it does. That's why I write my
own iptables scripts even for local firewall policies. You need to decide
for yourself in any given situation whether you can live with the &ldquo;allow
some inbound, allow all outbound&rdquo; compromise, which is undeniably the
simplest approach to local firewalls, or whether you're worried enough
about the threat of malware mischief to write a more restrictive script,
either manually or using a more sophisticated firewall tool than your
Linux distribution's installer.
</p><p>
Note that as with other functions of Linux installers, these firewall
wizards usually can be run again later, for example, in SUSE via YaST's
Security and Users&rarr;Firewall module.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x2b63488"></a>
Two Tools for Network Firewalls</h2></div></div><p>
We've discussed the hard way (writing your own iptables startup
script) and the easy way (letting your Linux installer generate
a local firewall script). There are, however, many other tools for
generating and managing sophisticated firewall scripts. Two of the most
popular are Shorewall and Firewall Builder (see Resources).
</p><p>
Shorewall is, essentially, a script/macro environment that lets you create
firewall policies in the form of text files, which are then
&ldquo;compiled&rdquo; into
iptables scripts. Shorewall's strengths are its flexibility, its ability
to insulate
users from needing to learn iptables syntax and its convenience in
automatically generating startup scripts. If you understand networking,
however, learning to use Shorewall isn't necessarily that much less
time consuming than learning iptables.
</p><p>
For this reason, I've personally not used Shorewall very much. Friends
of mine, however, who know less than me about networking but more about
system administration, swear by it.
</p><p>
Firewall Builder, which I covered several years ago in the May and June
2003 issues of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>,
is something else altogether. It's the firewall
equivalent of an Integrated Development Environment&mdash;that is, a graphical,
object-oriented interface for generating iptables scripts (among other
firewall types).
</p><p>
Conceptually, Firewall Builder is very similar to the policy editor
in Check Point firewalls. You create &ldquo;objects&rdquo; for the networks and
hosts you want to use in rules, and then you arrange those objects
and predefined &ldquo;service&rdquo; objects (HTTP, IMAP, FTP and so
forth) into graphical
rules statements. Firewall Builder not only generates these into iptables
scripts, but it also can install them on other systems via SSH.
</p><p>
In my experience, the main strike against Firewall Builder is its somewhat
lengthy list of dependencies, chief among them the Qt libraries for GUI
development. However, many of the things Firewall Builder needs are now
standard Linux packages included on typical distributions, so this is
less of a problem than it used to be. See the Firewall Builder home page
for detailed installation instructions.
</p><p>
Other graphical iptables utilities include Firestarter
and Guarddog (see Resources).

Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>
A couple years ago, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> named iptables its Security Tool
of the year. It really is a remarkable achievement. If you're serious
about network security, you'll want to explore iptables' power in much
greater detail than we've done in this article, starting with the
iptables(8) man page and progressing through the how-tos available on
the Netfilter home page (see Resources).
</p><p>
Whether you use iptables to protect your laptop or your entire
enterprise network, I hope you've found this introduction useful. Be safe!
