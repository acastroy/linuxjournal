The powerful iptables is intuitive enough even for lazy geeks to write
their own rules.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2117580.0x220f348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Let's talk about protecting your network from what people can fetch. I'm
going to take a twisty road to get there, so please stick with me.
</p><p>
I wrote a lengthy report published at
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/security/security_report_windows_vs_linux" target="_self">www.theregister.co.uk/security/security_report_windows_vs_linux</a>
that you might want to peruse. Allow me a couple caveats. The report is old,
dated October 2004. Don't e-mail me about the minor editing errors in
the text that I never went back to fix. They don't affect the thrust of
the report.
</p><p>
Anyway, I hope you read the whole report, but I reference it primarily
to draw out a single point. The Summer 2004 Evans Data Linux Developers
Survey states that 78% of Linux developers have never had a Linux
machine compromised. The Evans survey didn't explore the nature of the
very few Linux incidents that did occur. For example, some may have
been victims of an Apache worm. Apache runs on both Linux and Windows,
so those incidents would not be unique to Linux. More important, the
same Apache worm that made the rounds many years ago could do much more
damage on Windows than on Linux.
</p><p>
There's a reason for that. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure
out that Windows is far more vulnerable to serious security breaches than
Linux. Vista will not improve things. Microsoft seems more interested
in preventing users from bypassing DRM restrictions than preventing
crackers from breaking into Windows.
</p><p>
You can probably protect both Windows and Linux users from outside attacks
simply by putting them behind a NAT-enabled router. A Linux-based router or
even a cheap OTS box will usually do. The problem is that many security
breaches occur not due to incoming attacks, but because people fetch
tainted Web pages, download infected software or fetch myriad
other file types with embedded code that exploits all the holes in
Windows that allow people to escalate privileges and compromise the
entire Windows box. If everyone ran Linux, this might not be such a big
problem. Not everyone runs Linux. My kids use Linux, but they also use
Windows. This is not only a family issue though. You may be in charge
of a network where employees run Windows.
</p><p>
Here's what I've done to protect my kids. First, I have taken great pains
to limit their Web browsing to Firefox and their e-mail correspondence to
Thunderbird. This avoids the common IE and Outlook exploits. Second, even
though they access the Internet through a wireless NAT-enabled router,
that router is connected to a Linux server that examines and filters
what gets through before passing the traffic on to the Internet. I use
tinyproxy with DansGuardian to block content. I use MIME filters to
prevent potentially dangerous e-mail attachments from getting in. But,
the coup de grace is what I can do with iptables.
</p><p>
Before I continue, let me add a little perspective. I'd never consider
myself competent enough to be a Linux kernel developer, but I have
contributed a few lines of code to the kernel, and I have patched my
own kernel to work around things like a stubborn ASUS motherboard that
refused to shut down (the patch was too quick and dirty to be worthy
of the kernel but it worked for me). I have also contributed code in
various languages to projects like Xoops, Lphoto and more. My point is
that I'm not just an editor; I'm a programmer and an incurable
geek.
</p><p>
I'm a lazy geek, however. I would much rather defer to a GUI program
to generate firewall rules than write my own. But iptables has become
so intuitive that even lazy geeks can write their own rules. All I had
to grasp was how iptables processes traffic in terms of prerouting,
forwarding and postrouting. For example, the following rule is one
of many that preroutes various attempts to access the Web through
DansGuardian. I have many such rules, and they're more specific (they
specify the source IP address of various computers), but I'll list a
simplified version of the obvious one:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth1 -p tcp
 &#8618;--dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
</pre><p>
Beyond a little knowledge of syntax, that's almost an English
expression. It says to redirect the NAT traffic coming in through eth1
from port 80 to port 8080. If your kids or employees are clever enough
to try to access the Web through an external proxy, simply redirect those
ports to port 8080 too. You can use DansGuardian to block most other
attempts to sneak around this protection.
</p><p>
Our article &ldquo;Starting a Linux Firewall from Scratch&rdquo; on page
78 should help you get started with
iptables. There are far more comprehensive iptables tutorials on the Web,
one being <a href="http://iptables-tutorial.frozentux.net/iptables-tutorial.html" target="_self">iptables-tutorial.frozentux.net/iptables-tutorial.html</a>.
But most of them explore the complexities of iptables that only a security
expert would need. If your needs are light, like mine, don't be afraid
to explore iptables and take a shot at writing your own rules. You'll
find iptables much more friendly than you've ever imagined, and they're
indispensable as part of your security framework.
