How to set up and use SELinux Multi-Category Security.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x244c580.0x2544240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The release of Fedora Core 5 added several new features to SELinux,
one of which is Multi-Category Security (MCS). The purpose of MCS is
to protect data confidentiality, which means it will prevent secret
data from being exposed, but it is not designed to prevent the system from being
cracked. The SELinux functionality that you may be familiar with from
previous Fedora releases (known as the domain-type model) is still used
for protecting system integrity. MCS is an extra feature for preventing
accidental or deliberate leaks of secret data.
</p><p>
Earlier releases of SELinux used only the domain-type model for access
control. In the domain-type model, every process has a domain, and every
object that a process may access (files, directories and so on) has a type. The
system maintains a set of rules to specify which types each domain may
access and what type of access that should be.
</p><p>
Although domain-type can be used to implement all controls of system
integrity and data confidentiality (and has been used for this in
the past), it makes for a cleaner design if the goals of integrity
and confidentiality are separated. MCS is designed to protect data
confidentiality, thus allowing the domain-type part of the policy to be
focused on protecting system integrity. MCS is based on some of the design
features of Multi-Level Security (MLS). MLS is designed for military use
and is not suitable for most users, so I don't cover it in this article.
</p><p>
In the past, MLS has had little support, because it's difficult to use
and expensive. MCS is a default feature in Fedora Core 5 and above, so it will
have good support by application developers and system administrators. It
is expected that all applications written for Fedora Core 5 and above will
have support for MCS, and that, in most cases, the MCS support also will
allow those applications to support MLS. This means organizations
that need the MLS features will have a better choice of applications
than they would on a proprietary UNIX system.
</p><p>
MCS adds a sensitivity label (which I refer to as an MCS label for the
rest
of this article) to each security context. The security context is the complete
SELinux label for a process or a resource that a process may access. To
access a file, a process must have an MCS label that dominates the MCS
label of the file to be accessed. The MCS label is composed of a set
of categories. A process may have an MCS label with two levels, referred
to as high and low levels; the high level has a super-set of the
categories of the low level.
</p><p>
A file might have the MCS label s0:c0.c10. The s0 means nothing in the
MCS policy; that field is used by the MLS policy, and the same kernel
code is used for both MLS and MCS, so the format can't be changed. The
part that matters is c0.c10, which means the set of categories from c0 to
c10 inclusive (the . character indicates a range of categories). In
Fedora Core 5, there are 256 categories numbered from c0 to c255. In
Fedora Core 6, there will be 1,024 categories numbered from c0 to c1023.
</p><p>
A process might have the MCS label s0-s0:c0.c100, which means that the low
level of the label (or range) is s0 (no categories), and the high level is
s0:c0.c100, which means all categories from c0 to c100. Disjoint sets
of categories also are permitted. The label s0:c3,c5 means the categories
c3 and c5 are in the label. The MCS range +s0:c3,c5-s0:c0.c10,c20.c30
means that the low level has categories c3 and c5, while the high level
contains categories c0 to c10 inclusive and c20 to c30 inclusive.
</p><p>
Categories may be named, and it is expected that most users will name all
the categories that are used. In Fedora Core 5, you have to edit the file
/etc/selinux/targeted/setrans.conf to change the human-readable names
for the MCS labels. Below is a section of the default setrans.conf file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# s0:c0=CompanyConfidential
# s0:c1=PatientRecord
# s0:c2=Unclassified
# s0:c3=TopSecret
# s0:c1,c3=CompanyConfidentialRedHat
s0=
s0-s0:c0.c255=SystemLow-SystemHigh
s0:c0.c255=SystemHigh
</pre><p>
And, the following is an example of how to use semanage to change the
human-readable
translations of MCS labels in Fedora Core 6:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# semanage translation -a -T ProjectA s0:c0
# semanage translation -l
Level             Translation
s0
s0-s0:c0.c1023    SystemLow-SystemHigh
s0:c0             ProjectA
s0:c0.c1023       SystemHigh
</pre><p>
Figure 1 shows the access that processes are granted to files for all
combinations of the categories HR and Financial.

</p></div></div><p>
MCS is designed with ease of use as a major concern. At the current
time,
its design is to control only file access. It also controls ptrace (the
system interface used for strace, ltrace and debuggers) to prevent an
unprivileged process from using a debugger to capture secret data from
a more-privileged process.
</p><p>
The fact that MCS controls only file access does permit information leaks
through filenames, and cooperating processes may use TCP, UDP, UNIX domain
sockets or named pipes to transfer data. It was designed
this way intentionally, because restricting all forms of interprocess communication will
break many programs and make the entire system more difficult to use. The
MLS policy (which is available in Fedora Core 5 and above but not enabled
by default) restricts such communication methods, which is one of the
reasons why it is regarded as being too difficult for most people to use.
</p><p>
When designing MCS, we decided not to try to prevent two cooperating
users from inappropriately sharing data. We also decided not to prevent
a user from reading a file with secret data and then writing that data
to a file with a less secret label. Again, the MLS policy restricts these
operations, but it is too difficult for most people to use.
</p><p>
MCS and MLS are designed to protect confidentiality of data; they rely on
the domain-type model to protect system integrity. FC5 comes with three
policies. The default is targeted, which offers much the same integrity
protections as it did in FC4 but has the addition of MCS to protect data
confidentiality. The next option is the strict policy, which, again, is
much the same as it was in FC4 but with the addition of MCS. Finally,
there is a new policy in FC5 called mls; as the name suggests, this
includes the MLS system to protect data confidentiality. The domain-type
part of the mls policy is based on the strict policy (although not all
the d&aelig;mons from the strict policy are supported&mdash;only those from the
evaluation list for LSPP certification).
</p><p>
It is possible to compile an SELinux policy without support for MLS
or MCS features, but so far, no one has chosen to do so. It would
save very little memory and would be worth considering only for the
smallest embedded machines. It also is possible to use MLS instead of
MCS with the targeted policy, but no one has done so, because it would
not provide much benefit. System integrity is a precondition for data
confidentiality. Therefore, there is no benefit in combining a strong
system of confidentiality protection, such as MLS, with anything less than
the best protection of system integrity. The strict policy confines
all processes and significantly limits most of them. This is the level
of integrity protection that is needed to take full advantage of MLS.
</p><p>
In MCS, a process has a range. The high level of the range determines
the access granted to files, and the low level determines the default
level of files that are created (ranges apply only to processes in MCS).
</p><p>
For an MCS level to dominate another, it must have a set of categories that
is a super-set of the MCS level that is being dominated. It is possible
to have two sensitivity levels for which neither dominates the other
(for example, disjoint sets of categories). This is referred to as incomparable
levels, and both read and write access will be denied.
</p><p>
To use MCS, first you need to assign sensitivity levels to
users. In previous releases of SELinux, it was necessary to edit the
policy source and recompile the policy to set the security context
that is assigned to users when they log in, which was inconvenient and
error-prone. One of the new SELinux features in FC5 is the semanage
policy management tool. This supports changing the security contexts of
users (and adding and removing users) without compiling the
policy.
</p><p>
The default configuration of Fedora has the targeted policy that runs all
user login sessions in the unconfined_t domain (no access restrictions in
the domain-type model), so MCS provides the only SELinux access controls
for users. However, a default install of Fedora Core 5 needs to have
updates applied before MCS will work correctly. The development of MCS
was not complete until after the release of Fedora Core 5.
</p><p>
The first thing you must do when configuring an SELinux system to use
MCS is create SELinux identities and login records to map them to
UNIX accounts.
</p><p>
Listing 1 is an example of using semanage to add the SELinux identity
rjc with a low level of s0:c1 (which means every file the
user creates will have category c1 by default) and a high level of
SystemHigh, which maps to s0:c0.c1023 (the range of all categories
from c0 to c1023 inclusive&mdash;the highest level of MCS access) in Fedora
Core 6 and to s0:c0.c255 in Fedora Core 5. The -L parameter specifies
the default level. When using MCS, you always should make the default
level the low end of the range to avoid confusion. The -L option is
separate from the range to support the needs of the MLS policy.

</pre></div><p>
Fedora Core 5 uses the low end of the range for a process to specify
the default context of files. The range parameter is specified by the
-r switch. When using Fedora Core 5, often the only significant part of
the range is the high end, which specifies the access. You should use the
parameters <tt  >-P user -R system_r</tt> when creating a user with the targeted
policy (which is the default policy for a Fedora Core 5 install). The
strict policy is much like the targeted policy in terms of MCS. Most of
this article applies to the strict policy, although the -P and -R options
to the semanage command will need different parameters.
</p><p>
After adding an identity, you must add a login entry to assign a UNIX
account to the identity. The login configuration also allows you to
specify
the MCS range, because you may have many UNIX accounts with the same
SELinux identity that have different MCS ranges assigned to them when
they log in. You must use the -s parameter to specify the name of an
SELinux identity that already exists. If you do not use the -r option to
specify the range, it defaults to using no categories for the
login entry in question (which may not be valid, depending on the low
level of the range for the identity).
</p><p>
Below is an example of adding a login entry:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# semanage login -a -s rjc -r s0:c1-SystemHigh rjc
# semanage login -l

Login Name      SELinux User    MLS/MCS Range
__default__     user_u          s0
rjc             rjc             s0:c1-SystemHigh
root            root            SystemLow-SystemHigh
</pre><p>
Note that the range for a login entry must be a subset of the range for
an SELinux user identity. This means the low end of the login range
must not be lower than the low end of the user identity range, and the
high end of the login range must not be higher than the high end of the
user identity range. In most cases, you will create a login entry with
the same range as the user identity, so this won't be a problem.
</p><p>
After creating a file, it is possible to change the label to a different level
with the <tt  >chcon -l</tt> command. Below is an example of
how to use it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ touch foo
$ ls -lZ foo
-rw-r--r--  rjc rjc rjc:object_r:tmp_t            foo
$ chcon -l s0:c0 foo
$ ls -lZ foo
-rw-r--r--  rjc rjc rjc:object_r:tmp_t:ProjectA   foo
</pre><p>
Note that the level s0:c0 was translated to ProjectA; that is the
translation I created previously.
</p><p>
It is possible to run a process with a different range. The following is an
example of the use of the id -Z command to display the SELinux context
(including the MCS range at the end) as well as the use of the runcon -l command
to run an instance of bash in a different range:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ id -Z
rjc:system_r:unconfined_t:SystemLow-SystemHigh
$ runcon -l s0-s0:c10.c20 bash
$ id -Z
rjc:system_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c10.c20
$ runcon -l s0-s0:c9.c20 bash
execvp: Permission denied

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
MLS was implemented in a flexible manner via the policy language. This
allowed us to develop the MCS policy afterward using the same language
features and also permits the development of other category- and level-based confidentiality controls without changing kernel code. One example
of this is my new development, Mandatory MCS (MMCS).
</p><p>
A Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system is a system where the access
control is determined by the system administrator and enforced by
the operating system. Users are not permitted to override this
access control by granting excess access to their own data files. In
UNIX permissions, it is possible to create a mode 777 file in the /tmp
directory that grants full access to all users. With MMCS, I wanted to
prevent such access being granted. In the MMCS policy, it is not permitted
to write to a file with a level below the low level of the process. This
means that by setting the low levels for a user, the administrator can
determine the minimum access needed to read files created by that user.
</p><p>
MCS and MLS
policies have several significant differences. In MLS, the access is based on the low level of the range (the
effective clearance) with the high level of the range used mostly to
determine the access via the newrole program. In MCS, the access
for both reading and writing is based on the high level of the range
with the low level used only for restricting write access. Another
difference is that MCS is designed to protect only the contents of
files, while MLS restricts all methods of data transfer. Another major
difference is that in MCS, a process may launch a child with a different
range with minimal restrictions.
