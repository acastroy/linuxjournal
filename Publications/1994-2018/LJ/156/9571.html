What you don't know about MySQL could hurt you.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x100f580.0x11072f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In early 1995, when Windows 95 was still vaporware and Red Hat was
the upstart, user-friendly alternative to Slackware, I worked for the
&ldquo;Pathfinder&rdquo; site at media giant Time Warner. Like all media
companies, Time Warner realized that the Web was going to take off,
but wasn't sure just how that would happen.
</p><p>
So, it hired a bunch of programmers and designers, and gave us the
opportunity to experiment with different types of designs and
applications. It was a wonderful job, with some creative, smart and
interesting people. And, during my time there, I created all sorts of
applications&mdash;quizzes, mail auto-responders, games, search engines
and even a personalized version of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Money</em></span> magazine's &ldquo;Best
Cities&rdquo;
rankings.
</p><p>
As the applications I built became increasingly sophisticated, it
became obvious that the text files I often used for data storage
and retrieval were neither efficient nor flexible enough for a site as
large and popular as ours. Finally, someone introduced me to our
newly hired database guru, who taught me about the wonders of
relational databases and SQL. I was hooked, and I enjoyed working with
the database server that we had installed.
</p><p>
When I wanted to reap the benefits of SQL on my Linux box at home, my
options were, unfortunately, limited. I found a number of abandoned
open-source database projects, but nothing that was as powerful as
Time Warner's Sybase server or even in the same league.
</p><p>
So, you can imagine my delight when I discovered MySQL. No, it
didn't do all the things that Sybase did, and it wasn't released
under an open-source license. But, it was free of charge, it was easy
to install and it had enough features to keep people like me
relatively happy. Internet service providers felt similarly, and
began to install it on their systems&mdash;first as a competitive
advantage over their rivals, and then because everyone else was
including it in the base configuration.
</p><p>
Fast-forward more than a decade, and MySQL is by far the best-known
open-source relational database. Monty Widenius and David Axmark,
whom I met back when they were the only full-time MySQL programmers,
are now at the top of a large corporate pyramid. MySQL AB now
distributes its products under the GNU General Public License (GPL),
with a closed-source license available to those who require it. It
runs, as always, on a very large number of different operating
environments. And, it is still developed at a feverish pace by people
around the world, who submit patches and suggestions.
</p><p>
This is the first of three articles on open-source databases. This
month, I discuss MySQL, including its use, features and
problems. The next article will include a similar analysis of PostgreSQL,
and
the third article in the series will compare the two databases.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x100f580.0x1107710"></a>
Starting with MySQL</h2></div></div><p>
One of MySQL's claims to fame is the ease with which people can get
started using it. And, indeed, when you compare MySQL with many
commercial databases, it is strikingly simple. You install it
(typically with an RPM or Deb, but compiling it from source is also
straightforward), and start up the database server with
<tt  >safe_mysqld</tt>. (You also could use the plain
mysqld command, but
then you wouldn't benefit from some of the behind-the-scenes
housekeeping that safe_mysqld offers.)
</p><p>
Once you have started the server, you can create one or more
databases. (I admit it is somewhat confusing that MySQL is
often referred to as a database when, in fact, it is a database
server, offering you the chance to create one or more databases.
Each database contains one or more two-dimensional tables.) To create
a database, use the mysqladmin program:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mysqladmin create testdb
</pre><p>
It is quite possible, depending on your configuration, that the above
command worked without a hitch&mdash;particularly if you are logged in as
the root user under Linux. However, your system administrator might
have (wisely) decided to set a password for the MySQL root user,
in which case, you need to type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mysqladmin -p create testdb
</pre><p>The -p option tells mysqladmin that you want to enter a password for
this account. You also can specify the root user, or any other user,
with the -u option, as in:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mysqladmin -u mysqlroot -p create testdb
</pre><p>
Once you have created a database, you then can connect to it with the
mysql client program:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mysql -u mysqlroot -p testdb
</pre><p>
Notice that I'm once again specifying a user name and that I want
to enter a password. I return to the subject of permissions
below; for now, we assume that this combination works.
</p><p>
In the client, you can issue any SQL command you want, and it will be
executed immediately. For example, we can create a new table:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE Classes (
class_name    TEXT    NOT NULL,
room_number INTEGER  NOT NULL,
starting_date  DATE NOT NULL,
ending_date   DATE  NOT NULL,
instructor       TEXT    NOT NULL
);
</pre><p>
One of the problems with the above table is that it lacks a unique
primary key. This makes it difficult to refer to the Classes table
from another table. We could use the name assigned to the class by
the university's registration system, but there is no guarantee that
this will be unique. Moreover, what will we do next year, when a
class of the same name is offered? For this reason (among others),
it's the norm to create an &ldquo;artificial&rdquo; primary key, one whose purpose
is to identify a row within the database uniquely.
</p><p>
In MySQL, we can do this most easily with the AUTO_INCREMENT keyword.
For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE Classes (
    class_id         INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT,
class_name    TEXT    NOT NULL,
room_number INTEGER  NOT NULL,
starting_date  DATE NOT NULL,
ending_date   DATE  NOT NULL,
instructor       TEXT    NOT NULL,

    PRIMARY KEY(class_id)
);
</pre><p>
If we want, we can INSERT a row into Classes with an explicit integer
value for class_id. The fact that class_id is defined as a primary
key means that it is both indexed and guaranteed to be unique. But, if
we fail to enter an explicit value for class_id, MySQL inserts a
new value into the column, giving us a primary key value for the new
class without having to calculate it ourselves.
</p><p>
The above table definition shows a few of the many data types
MySQL offers. MySQL offers many traditional data types, such as
NUMERIC and VARCHAR, but it also includes a number of signed and
unsigned numeric types (for example, TINYINT, SMALLINT, MEDIUMINT, INT and
SIGINT), a number of CLOB/BLOB types (such as, CHAR, BINARY, BLOB and
TEXT), and several having to do with dates and times (DATE, DATETIME
and TIMESTAMP). There are also ENUM and SET types, allowing you to
work with nonstandard sets of enumerated data.
</p><p>
MySQL also offers a wide variety of operators, from simple
string-concatenation, to date extraction, to one of my favorites, the
CASE statement, which lets you place if-then logic inside of a query.
</p><p>
In addition, MySQL offers a system for full-text search. This means
you can store text inside of TEXT columns in your tables, and
then identify the column (and retrieve the text) without having to
index it yourself.
</p><p>
If the included suite of functions doesn't suit your needs, you can
always write one of your own. Recent versions of MySQL also offer the
ability to create a stored procedure or function, which provides both
increased speed and centralized control over commonly used
functions.
Stored procedures also can be invoked automatically when particular
events occur, known as a trigger in database parlance. You also
can write new functions in C or C++, loading them into MySQL at runtime.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x100f580.0x1107fa8"></a>
Table Types</h2></div></div><p>
So far, MySQL sounds like a nice, flexible relational database. You
might be surprised, however, to find that there is a huge amount of pent-up
frustration, and even hostility, toward MySQL in the Open Source and
Database communities. Just look for a recent story on Slashdot about
MySQL, and you will see many comments indicating that PostgreSQL,
Firebird or nearly any other option would be a better solution.
</p><p>
Part of this stems from a time-honored tradition of rivalry in the
computer world, and particularly in the Open Source community. Over
the years, we have seen fights between Emacs and vi, Perl and Python,
Linux and BSD, and countless other pairings.
</p><p>
But, part of the animosity toward MySQL stems from several design
decisions that the authors made early on. For example, documentation
for an old version of MySQL said that foreign keys are really
unnecessary, and that such integrity checks could (and should) be
handled in the application, rather than in the database. Many
experienced database people see this and don't know whether to laugh
or cry. The primary reason for using a database is for its
reliability, not speed, and adding foreign-key checks is an easy way to
increase the reliability of inserted data.
</p><p>
Similarly, old versions of MySQL failed to lock tables. If you wanted
to be sure that no one would write to a table from which you were
reading (or to which you were writing), you needed to lock
the table explicitly at the application layer. Given the many years of research
that had gone into row-level locking (and even more-advanced systems,
such as mutliversion concurrency control), this seemed to many like a
step backward.
</p><p>
MySQL's solution to these problems has been a novel one. Rather than
add these features to the existing (MyISAM) table structure, it
made it possible to choose from a number of different table
structures, each with its own set of trade-offs. Much as Linux system
administrators can choose from a variety of filesystems, MySQL
administrators and programmers can choose from several different
storage engines.
</p><p>
This approach has some problems, of course. The biggest
problem from my perspective is that MyISAM remains the default storage
engine, which means that many users effectively choose to go without
foreign keys and sophisticated locking due to ignorance. Many other
storage engines seem to be of more limited use or for particular
applications, such as MEMORY (for in-memory databases), BDB (Berkeley
DB-based) tables and even FEDERATED (for tables on remote servers).
</p><p>
A very popular storage engine, InnoDB, has a different problem
associated with it&mdash;the company that develops InnoDB was purchased
by Oracle earlier this year. This may have no effect on MySQL's
open-source distribution, because Oracle continues to make InnoDB
available under the GPL. But, it has raised some questions regarding
MySQL's commercial version, given that an essential part of the
commercial-grade toolbox is now owned by a major database rival.
</p><p>
Much has been made about MySQL's fast performance over the years, with
little or no tuning of the server. The truth is a bit hazier than
that; although MySQL is undoubtedly a fast database, many of those tests
were made using MyISAM tables, which are inherently faster because
of their lack of locks and integrity checks. (As an analogy, I often
say that it's faster to leave your house without locking the door,
but the extra speed is usually not worth the risk.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x100f580.0x1108370"></a>
Scalability</h2></div></div><p>
Many of the features in recent versions of MySQL have been aimed at
corporate customers, whose license purchases are helping drive
MySQL development forward. One of the biggest bottlenecks that a
database administrator can face, particularly as the data grows in
size, is disk speed. Recent versions of MySQL thus provide both
tablespaces (that is, allocation of disk space on a per-table basis) and
partitions (that is, division of a table across several filesystems).
Tablespaces are available only with InnoDB tables, but partitions are
available for all storage engines. Moreover, tables can be
partitioned based on column values, using a hash function to decide
into which partition a particular row should be placed.
</p><p>
Another important aspect of MySQL has been replication and backup.
These are crucial features for enterprise clients, who need their data
to be available all the time and to have backups available at a
moment's notice. The latest versions of MySQL have improved the
replication engine and have also made it more flexible, making it
possible to replicate tables even on a per-row basis.
</p><p>
Another feature I have been waiting to see for some time is
Unicode support. Although not all string and regexp operations work with
Unicode, this is a big boon to those who work with multiple languages.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x100f580.0x1108528"></a>
Community</h2></div></div><p>
Perhaps the biggest asset that MySQL has going for it is a very large,
very active community of users and developers. The sheer number of
books, Web sites, mailing lists, help forums and code snippets for
MySQL is overwhelming.
</p><p>
For its part, MySQL AB has been doing an admirable job of updating the
documentation on a regular basis and of moving forward with new
features at an impressive rate. (This demonstrates that although
open-source software can often be written by volunteers, having paid
professionals work on a project can speed it up immensely.) In
particular, I am impressed by the on-line documentation, which includes
not only numerous examples, but also intelligently placed links to
related subjects.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
MySQL has grown up quite a bit since I first began to use it more than
ten years ago. Some of its quirks, such as using MyISAM tables by
default, continue to rankle serious database users who would like to
see transactions and foreign keys everywhere. But, especially with
versions 5.0 and 5.1, MySQL is looking like a database that can
advertise its depth of serious features, rather than claim its
main advantage is speed.
