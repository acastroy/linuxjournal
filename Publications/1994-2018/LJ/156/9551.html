How to set up and use the powerful open-source network access control
solution.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2854580.0x294c500"></a></h2></div></div><p>
With the ever-increasing number of attacks on networks&mdash;either by
people accessing them
anonymously or generating illegal activities from them, having great security
tools is essential. Although a good firewall and tools, such as Snort and
Nessus, can increase security, network administrators are looking for
solutions that complete those security tools by responding automatically to a violation
of network usage policy. Such tools are called network access control
(NAC) solutions. Many of those tools exist&mdash;especially proprietary ones from big
vendors, such as Cisco&mdash;but an open-source solution, PacketFence,
deserves attention.
</p><p>
PacketFence is a free and open-source solution that provides network access
control functionalities, including the following standard features:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Registration of network components (desktops, laptops, printers and so on)
and, optionally, acceptance of a network usage policy upon registration
before gaining complete network access.
</p></li><li><p>
Detection of network usage policy violations based on passive and active
network scans on all connected nodes.
</p></li><li><p>
Isolation of offending nodes.
</p></li><li><p>
Notification (e-mail, pop-ups and so on) based on a network usage policy
violation.
</p></li><li><p>
Remediation so that network components can regain their network access
after a violation.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9551f1.large.jpg"><img src="9551f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Relations between PacketFence Standard Features
</p></div></div><p>
PacketFence is written in Perl and makes use of common open-source
components, such as MySQL, Apache, Snort and Nessus. It does not require a user agent to be
installed on computers accessing the network. Its deployment is
non-intrusive,
and every interaction with users goes through a captive portal that can be
accessed by every Web browser.
</p><p>
PacketFence currently supports ARP, DHCP/DNS and VLAN isolation techniques.
Choosing the right isolation method depends on the size of your network and
the networking equipment you possess. In this article, we cover ARP-based
isolation, which works on any kind of networking equipment.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2854580.0x294cce8"></a>
ARP-Based Isolation</h2></div></div><p>
ARP-based isolation
works by poisoning the ARP cache of any equipment connected to the
network. As you know, ARP is a protocol used to map IP addresses to
MAC addresses. Fundamentally, four basic types of messages exist in
Ethernet ARP that are interesting for PacketFence:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
ARP request: request for the destination MAC.
</p></li><li><p>
ARP reply: reply containing the MAC.
</p></li><li><p>
RARP request: request IP from MAC.
</p></li><li><p>
RARP reply: reply containing the IP.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The problem with ARP is that when a client issues an ARP request,
it simply trusts the reply that comes in and stores it into its
cache. Poisoning the ARP cache is as simple as sending ARP replies to
the client, even if it hasn't asked for one. The operating system
likely will update the cache upon reception of such packets, or it'll use the
poisoned data we send when it decides to update the cache.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2854580.0x294d160"></a>
Installation and Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
PacketFence has been developed on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4,
CentOS 4 and Fedora Core. Several people have succeeded in running
it on different distributions, but to ease your first installation,
it might be better to stick with one of the officially supported
distributions. Because PacketFence is a NAC solution and installing it
will act on your current LAN, make sure to coordinate your tests
with your network administrator.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2854580.0x294d268"></a>
Preparation</h2></div></div><p>
PacketFence uses a MySQL database to store the information about the
nodes connected to the network, whom they belong to and whether there are any
violations of the specified network policy. So, if you don't already
have a dedicated MySQL server you want to use for this purpose, install
MySQL server by running <tt  >up2date -i mysql-server</tt>.
</p><p>
As mentioned previously, PacketFence can use Snort and Nessus, and we
describe
below how you can integrate both tools with PacketFence.
</p><p>
Snort is an open-source network intrusion detection system that uses
signatures to analyze the network traffic. Once a given packet matches
a signature, Snort can generate an alert. Signatures not only exist
for many computer viruses and spyware, but also for network
traffic, such as BitTorrent, ICQ, Skype or even Hotmail access. They are
available from Sourcefire, Inc., through the Snort Web site, and through
Bleeding Edge Threats (see Resources). PacketFence also ships with an
Oinkmaster configuration to obtain and cut down the ruleset automatically to
only what is required by PacketFence. Because PacketFence support
for Snort 2.6 is still under development, download Snort 2.4.5 from
<a href="http://www.snort.org/dl/binaries/linux/old" target="_self">www.snort.org/dl/binaries/linux/old</a>, and then install the RPM by
executing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -ivh snort-2.4.5-1.RHEL4.i386.rpm
</pre><p>
Nessus, on the other hand, is an active vulnerability
scanner&mdash;meaning that it generates connections to the hosts you want to test for
vulnerabilities. You have to register with Tenable Network Security,
the owner of Nessus, in order to receive the available plugins. Install
Nessus by downloading version 2.2.9 for Linux and executing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sh nessus-installer-2.2.9.sh
</pre><p>
Nessus 3 is not yet well supported, and due
to the licensing issues surrounding it, stick with 2.2.9.
</p><p>
Once
the installation finishes, start Nessus with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/opt/nessus/sbin/nessusd -D
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2854580.0x294d6e0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and test the connection with NessusClient, which is available as a
separate download.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2854580.0x294d7e8"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Download the PacketFence RPM from the SourceForge repository,
and install
it using:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -ivh packetfence-1.6.2-1.i386.rpm
</pre><p>
In /usr/local/pf, you will find two Perl scripts that will help you with the
necessary configuration steps: installer.pl and configurator.pl. Change
your current directory to /usr/local/pf, and execute
<tt  >installer.pl</tt>. The
script, among other things, sets up the PacketFence database, installs all
the necessary Perl modules (which are quite a few) and creates a user
account for the Web GUI.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2854580.0x294d9f8"></a>
Configuration Steps</h2></div></div><p>
Now, the real configuration work starts. First, execute
<tt  >configurator.pl</tt>, and you'll be offered several
choices. Choose the template configuration
based on the testing mode. You'll be asked to supply several network
parameters (DHCP servers, DNS servers and so on), and a basic configuration
file, /usr/local/pf/conf/pf.conf, will be created. This configuration
file contains only the differences you apply to the default configuration
parameters saved in /usr/local/pf/conf/pf.conf.defaults. Have a look at
conf/pf.conf.defaults to get an idea of the available options. To help
you see what's going on inside PacketFence, add the following lines to
/usr/local/pf/conf/pf.conf to increase the logging level:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[logging]
verbosity=8
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2854580.0x294dbb0"></a>
Basic Usage</h2></div></div><p>
Start PacketFence with <tt  >service packetfence start</tt>. Have a look at
/var/log/messages, and you should see that PacketFence started creating
an inventory of all nodes on your network, as in the following example:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Jan  3 16:05:28 pf pf: update_hashes(5): UPDATE
 New node 00:07:e9:05:4c:f2 (192.168.0.1)
Jan  3 16:05:28 pf pf: update_hashes(5): UPDATE
 New node 00:90:27:6a:71:ea (192.168.0.2)
</pre><p>
/usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd is the PacketFence command-line
interface. Executing it without any further parameters shows a help
screen with the available options. In order to show all nodes in the
database, execute:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#/usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd node view
mac|pid|detect_date|regdate|lastskip|status|
user_agent|computername|last_arp|last_dhcp|switch|
port|vlan|dhcp_fingerprint
00:07:e9:05:4c:f2|1|2007-01-03 16:05:28|||unreg|||
2007-01-03 16:10:11|||||
00:90:27:6a:71:ea|1|2007-01-03 16:05:28|||unreg|||
2007-01-03 16:10:12|||||
</pre><p>
Manually registering a node can be done with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd
 &#8618;node edit 00:07:e9:05:4c:f2 status="reg",pid=1
</pre><p>
You also can use pfcmd to access the documentation for every configuration
parameter. To see the documentation for the logo parameter from the
[general] section:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd config help general.logo
GENERAL.LOGO
Default: /common/packetfence.gif
Logo displayed on Web pages.
</pre><p>
Have a look at the available reports using:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd help report
</pre><p>
The os and osclass reports use PacketFence's DHCP fingerprinting
feature, which tries to determine the operating system of every DHCP
request (including the ones made by printers, VoIP phones, switches
and so on).
</p><p>
Running:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd report os
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2854580.0x29449c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
shows the number and percentage
of nodes on your network for every detected operating system. Note that
the DHCP fingerprinting feature easily can be used to disallow
access to your network by computers running specific operating
systems.
</p><p>
PacketFence also features an administrative Web GUI, which, by
default, is available on the secured port 1443. Direct your browser
to https://&lt;pf-host&gt;:1443/. Once you enter the login/password you
defined during the installation, you can start monitoring and configuring
PacketFence through the GUI.
</p><p>
When you start enforcing the registration of nodes with PacketFence, all
nodes on the network have to be registered before they can gain
complete network access. This registration requirement applies
to all gear with network access, including wireless access points and
printers. So, before actually activating this option in the configuration
file, it is wise to preregister those types of devices manually.
</p><p>
For
computers with Web browsers, on the other hand, the registration can
be done by the user through the PacketFence captive portal. The portal
can verify login/password information through a htaccess file, Radius
or LDAP, which we use in our example. In order to do this, you need to
adapt the provided template /usr/local/pf/conf/templates/ldap.conf
to fit your LDAP structure.
</p><p>
Because all your users will be redirected
to the registration screen, it also is wise at this point to change
the default PacketFence logo, which is shown on the Web pages, to your
own company logo. This can be done by adding
<tt  >logo=/common/mylogo.gif</tt>
to the [default] section in /usr/local/pf/conf/pf.conf and copying the
file mylogo.gif into the directory /usr/local/pf/html/common/.
</p><p>
To activate the registration, incorporate the following parameters into
/usr/local/pf/conf/pf.conf:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[trapping]
testing=disabled
detection=disabled

[registration]
aup=disabled
auth=ldap
</pre><p>
Now, restart PacketFence with <tt  >service packetfence
restart</tt>.
You should see in /var/log/messages that PacketFence is trapping
unregistered nodes by ARP-spoofing your network's gateway. From the client
side, opening a Web browser and accessing any outside Web site should lead to a
redirection to the PacketFence captive portal, which allows you to register the
computer. You also can determine whether a client has been ARP-spoofed by
executing <tt  >arp -n -a</tt> (under Linux) on the client and checking which MAC is
saved in the ARP cache for your network's gateway.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2854580.0x2944e90"></a>
Incorporating Snort and Nessus</h2></div></div><p>
You can take it a step further by adding Snort alerts to your PacketFence
installation. Let's assume that using BitTorrent clients is prohibited
in your environment and you want to configure PacketFence to enforce this
policy.
Edit /usr/local/pf/conf/violations.conf so that the section containing
BitTorrent reads as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[2000334]
desc=P2P (BitTorrent)
priority=8
url=/content/index.php?template=p2p
disable=N
max_enable=1
actions=trap,email,log
trigger=Detect::2000334,Detect::2000357,
&#8618;Detect::2000369
</pre><p>
This tells PacketFence that:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The BitTorrent violation can be generated by the Snort alerts 2000334,
2000357 and 2000369 (the trigger parameter).
</p></li><li><p>
The system has to act upon this violation by isolating the user, sending
an e-mail alert to the administrator and logging the violation to
/var/log/messages (the actions parameter).
</p></li><li><p>
The user is allowed to re-enable network access once (the max_enable
parameter).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Finally, you need to activate Snort from inside PacketFence by incorporating
the following into conf/pf.conf:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[trapping]
detection=enabled

[interface eth0]
type=internal, managed,monitor
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2854580.0x2945360"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and restarting the PacketFence service. Note that if you are using
switches, you have to redirect a copy of your network traffic to
eth0 (the PacketFence monitor&mdash;that is, the interface Snort listens to
for packets).
</p><p>
Generating a violation in PacketFence is now as simple as launching
your favorite BitTorrent client, such as Azureus. Do so, and open a
torrent file to start a download. Once a couple of packets are exchanged
on the network, Snort should catch some and match them with
the 2000334, 2000357 or 2000369 rules. Those rules, which come from
the Bleeding Edge Threats rulesets, correspond to BitTorrent peer sync,
traffic and announce, respectively. Once Snort logs such unusual
activity, PacketFence reacts by creating a violation.
</p><p>
As an administrator, you can see the list of violations with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd violation view all
</pre><p>
As a user, on your
computer, launch your favorite Web browser and try to open any outside
Web site. You'll be redirected to the PacketFence system automatically,
which will display the peer-to-peer template, as shown in Figure
2.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9551f2.large.jpg"><img src="9551f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. PacketFence Peer-to-Peer Template
</p></div></div><p>
Stopping the BitTorrent client lets you regain network
access. Now, try to use BitTorrent a second time. As before, an alert
is generated, and your browser is redirected to the PacketFence
portal. But this time, however, you won't get another chance to re-enable your
access. In real life, offending users would have to call their network
administrator to re-enable network access.
</p><p>
To activate the Nessus scanning of hosts trying to register with
PacketFence, add the following section to /usr/local/pf/conf/pf.conf:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">

[scan]
ssl=enabled
pass=&lt;nessus_passwd&gt;
user=&lt;nessus_user&gt;
port=1241
host=127.0.0.1
registration=enabled

</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2854580.0x2945888"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and restart the PacketFence service. Trying to add a computer running an
unpatched version of Microsoft Windows now generates an immediate
violation. You also can use the administrative Web GUI (the Scan tab)
to define that complete Nessus scans should be executed every night.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2854580.0x2945990"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Deploying PacketFence in your network
with ARP-based isolation is simple. Although this isolation technique is
easy to deploy, it doesn't necessarily scale well and could be bypassed
by wise users with static ARP-cache entries.
</p><p>
Other isolation techniques exist in PacketFence, such as DHCP/DNS,
which scales well. At Inverse, we also added VLAN-based isolation to
PacketFence, which makes this solution more secure and appealing
for large networks. PacketFence is an ideal solution for securing
campus networks or even a part of your network (a VLAN or
subnet). Finally, a high-quality NAC solution has emerged from the FOSS
community, and the evolution of PacketFence is promising.
