The quality of your Dojo depends upon your connections.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13eb580.0x14e33a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, we began looking at Dojo, one of the most popular
open-source JavaScript toolkits to emerge in the last year or two.
Although using a toolkit is not required if you want to include Ajax or
sophisticated client-side functionality in your Web application, it
certainly makes things a great deal easier. In particular, such
toolkits typically know how to handle the many subtle differences in
JavaScript implementations on different browsers. JavaScript is far
more standardized than used to be the case, but a
number of traps still exist when trying to work with multiple platforms, and using
a toolkit can relieve you of having to handle them yourself.
</p><p>
In last month's article, we looked at Dojo's packaging system, some of
its enhancements to the JavaScript language and its rich-text editor.
This month, we look at some of Dojo's other capabilities that
might interest modern Web developers, including support for events and
Ajax.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13eb580.0x14e3558"></a>
Event Handlers</h2></div></div><p>
One of the cornerstones of JavaScript programming is the use of event
handlers&mdash;functions that are invoked when a particular event occurs.
For example, we can define a function that opens an alert box:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    function openAlert() {
    alert("Hello!  This is an alert!");
}
&lt;/script&gt;

</pre><p>
We can then tell the user's browser to invoke our openAlert function
whenever someone clicks on a paragraph of text:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;p onclick="openAlert();"&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

</pre><p>
There are several interesting things to notice in this short example.
First, we have set the onclick event handler in this case.
About a half-dozen other event handlers exist from which we could
choose. In many cases, we might set more than one event handler. This
was particularly prevalent in the pre-CSS days, when JavaScript event
handlers would be used to change the look of an icon when the mouse
was hovering over it.
</p><p>
Second, event handlers sometimes can be used in contexts you
might not expect. For example, the above &lt;p&gt; tag has an onclick
handler. You normally wouldn't think of clicking on a paragraph of
text, but we can do that. This is the basis for some of the modern
drag-and-drop events.
</p><p>
Third, although JavaScript does make it pretty easy to attach handlers
to particular events, some messiness still is involved. We
cannot define multiple event handlers easily or disconnect handlers
that have been defined.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13eb580.0x14e3870"></a>
Dojo Events</h2></div></div><p>
By this point, you might be wondering what JavaScript event handlers
have to do with using Dojo for Ajax and modern Web applications. The
answer is that much of Dojo's functionality, across all of its many
packages, depends on the event system. If you want to use Dojo's Ajax
package, for example, you need to connect it using Dojo events.
This might seem restrictive at first glance; however, Dojo events are
surprisingly easy to understand.
</p><p>
As a simple example, let's see how we might implement our onclick
handler from before using Dojo events. First, we need to
modify our event-handling function so that it takes one argument,
the event itself:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    function openAlert(evt) {
    alert("Hello!  This is an alert from Dojo!");
}
&lt;/script&gt;

</pre><p>
Next, we must connect the paragraph to the event. Rather than doing
this directly, by setting the onconnect handler, we give our
paragraph an id tag:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;p id="para"&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

</pre><p>
Now, we can use Dojo's dojo.byId function&mdash;similar in some ways to
Prototype's $() function&mdash;to get the node itself:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
var para = dojo.byId("para");
</pre><p>
Finally, we connect our paragraph to the handler function we created:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dojo.event.connect(para, "onclick", openAlert);
</pre><p>
If we put it all together, we get the program shown in Listing 1, which I
have called test-dojo.html.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13eb580.0x14e3ce8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 1. test-dojo.html</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Testing JavaScript with Dojo&lt;/title&gt;

    &lt;script type="text/javascript"
    src="/javascript/dojo.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
        dojo.require("dojo.event.*");

        function openAlert(evt) {
        alert("Hello!  This is an alert from Dojo!");
        }
    &lt;/script&gt;

  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p id="para"&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
      var para = dojo.byId("para");
      dojo.event.connect(para, "onclick", openAlert);
      &lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre></div><p>
One thing you might notice is the three &lt;script&gt; tags in
the file. The first, in the head of the document, downloads dojo.js,
the main Dojo source file, from the server. The second, also in the
head of the document, imports the Dojo package for events and defines
our event-handling function, openAlert. The third and final piece of
JavaScript, which attaches the node to the event, is in the body of
the document, right after our p tag is defined. This is because we
can set an event handler only for an object that already exists, which
means after the p tag itself.
</p><p>
If you load the page into a browser window, you will see that it works
just like the previous version. Given that this version is more
complex, it might not seem obvious how it is better.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13eb580.0x14e3fa8"></a>
Advanced Dojo Events</h2></div></div><p>
Here, then, is one example. Suppose you want to invoke one
particular object method, rather than a simple function call, in an
event handler. JavaScript makes it difficult to do this directly from
an event handler. However, dojo.event.connect handles this quite
simply, in its four-parameter version. As before, the first two
parameters are the node and event that will trigger the handler. The
third and fourth arguments are the object and function that will be
invoked. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dojo.event.connect(eventObject, "onclick",
                   handlerObject, "handlerMethod");
</pre><p>
Dojo also makes it possible to connect more than one handler to an
event. In non-Dojo JavaScript, you could accomplish this only by
making your event handler a function that then invokes other
functions. Using Dojo events, you can connect any number of methods:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dojo.event.connect(para, "onclick", testFormContents);
dojo.event.connect(para, "onclick", submitFormContents);
</pre><p>
Events are fired in the order that they are connected. So, in the
above example, testFormContents would be invoked before
submitFormContents.
</p><p>
Note that Dojo allows you to add the same event handler twice, if
you want. So, be careful to invoke dojo.event.connect only once for
each event-handler combination to avoid potentially odd and
hard-to-debug problems.
</p><p>
Let's say you want to provide an expert mode to your users, so
they don't have to see all of the annoying alert boxes we're
generating. We could create a button that, when pressed, removes the
event handler from the object&mdash;ooh, but now that's getting kind of
tricky, especially if we have multiple events to deal with.
</p><p>
The solution is to use dojo.event.disconnect, which does what you
might expect:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dojo.event.disconnect(para, "onclick", testFormContents);
</pre><p>
dojo.event.disconnect requires that the parameters be completely
identical to those used in dojo.event.connect. Once it is invoked,
however, the event is disconnected.
</p><p>
An advanced piece of the event system is known as advice, a term
that always has confused me, but which is common in the worlds of Lisp
and aspect-oriented programming. The basic idea behind advice is that
you can tell the system to invoke a function before or after another
function. (If you have used Ruby on Rails, this is analogous to
a filter.) This is admittedly an advanced feature, but it might help
when debugging an application&mdash;rather than inserting
logging statements into a problematic function manually, you simply can add
advice to the function, invoking the logger before or after the
function is invoked.
</p><p>
There is even a topic mechanism for Dojo events, which lets you
create multiple channels for event notifications. (This is similar
in some ways to the syslog facility in Linux and UNIX.) Thus, a
particular object might register its interest when particular
events happen on another object.
</p><p>
Finally, Dojo events are used to give functionality to widgets&mdash;Dojo's
name for GUI elements made up of HTML and CSS.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13eb580.0x14e4580"></a>
Ajax in Dojo</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we understand how to create and use Dojo events, we can look
at how to perform Ajax queries using Dojo. As you may recall, Ajax
(which stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a paradigm for
Web development that uses the browser's ability to make HTTP requests
behind the scenes. Combining such background HTTP requests with
JavaScript, the DOM and CSS makes it possible to create more
intuitive and aesthetic Web applications. We could create Ajax
applications without Dojo or another toolkit, but it's much easier
and more expressive to use a toolkit, if only because it means we
can avoid browser differences and incompatibilities.
</p><p>
Listing 2 shows dojo-ajax.html, a page that contains only a
single button marked &ldquo;Press here&rdquo;. When the button is pressed, the
user sees an alert box, much as in Listing 1. But, in this
version of the program, the contents of the alert box have come from a
server-side program, defined in this case to be the very short
hello.php (Listing 3).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13eb580.0x14e4738"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 2. dojo-ajax.html</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Testing Ajax with Dojo&lt;/title&gt;

  &lt;script type="text/javascript"
   src="/javascript/dojo.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    dojo.require("dojo.io.*");
    dojo.require("dojo.event.*");

    function ajaxAlert(evt) {

      var ajaxArgs = {
          url: "hello.php",

          error: function(type, data, evt){
              alert("An error occurred");
          },

          load: function(type, data, evt){
              alert(data);
          },

          mimetype: "text/plain",

          formNode: document.getElementById("myForm")
          };
          dojo.io.bind(ajaxArgs);
    }
 &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;form id="theForm"&gt;
    &lt;input type="button" id="theButton"
     value="Press here" /&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;

    &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  var theButton = dojo.byId("theButton");
  dojo.event.connect(theButton, "onclick", ajaxAlert);
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13eb580.0x14e4948"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 3. hello.php</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;? echo "Hello from the server!"; ?&gt;

</pre></div><p>
The button itself is defined as we might do with any button to which we expect
to attach an event, with an id attribute. It sits inside of a very
small HTML form, named &ldquo;theForm&rdquo;:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;form id="theForm"&gt;
&lt;input type="button" id="theButton" value="Press here" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

</pre><p>
Using Dojo events, we connect the button to a function (ajaxAlert):
</p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    var theButton = dojo.byId("theButton");
    dojo.event.connect(theButton, "onclick", ajaxAlert);
&lt;/script&gt;

</pre><p>
The only remaining question is what the ajaxAlert function does.
First, it creates a JavaScript object literal and assigns it to the
local variable ajaxArgs. This object literal assigns several names
that will help our Ajax call work: url is the URL of the
server-side program that will respond to our Ajax call, error
indicates which function should be invoked if an error occurs, load
indicates what function should be invoked if the call to url is
successful and mimetype defines the MIME type we expect to
receive from the server.
</p><p>
One of the annoying aspects of some other JavaScript toolkits is that
they require you to create your own list of name-value pairs to be
submitted in the Ajax request. This is not the case with Dojo. By setting the
formNode name in our object literal to a form node, we can rest
assured that all the form elements will be passed to the server.
In this particular case, that is not necessarily useful or
interesting, but it certainly saves some programmer time and
increases program readability.
</p><p>
Finally, our ajaxArgs object is bound, and we're off and running.
Clicking on the button means the associated Dojo event is
invoked, which is ajaxAlert. That function, thanks to dojo.io.bind,
then sends its arguments to the defined URL and invokes the load
function upon successful completion. This is surprisingly
straightforward and opens up many possible avenues for using Ajax in
applications.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Dojo, which we explored over the last two installments of this column, and Prototype,
which we looked at in the January 2007 issue, are both strong libraries for Web
developers looking to improve the quality of their JavaScript. Each
has a different style associated with it. I tend to be more of a
Prototype kind of guy, but many aspects of Dojo are
also quite appealing to me. In particular, Dojo's extensive set of
widgets, and the way those widgets can be connected to one
another via the event system, provides a rich set of functionality
that all JavaScript developers can enjoy. Even if you don't plan to
use Dojo, you should consider installing and trying it, just
to understand how it works.
