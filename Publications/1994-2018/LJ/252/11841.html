My Pebble watch has several orders of magnitude more power than the
mainframe computers used by NASA to land astronauts on the moon and then
get them back safely. In fact, at the time, the six-megabyte program IBM
developed to monitor the astronaut's biometric and environmental data was
the most complex software ever written! Times certainly have changed, but
our desire to push computing to its very limit surely hasn't. This month is
the High-Performance Computing issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, and whether you plan
to land humans on the moon or analyze weather data over the Atlantic,
this issue should tickle your fancy.
</p><p>
We start out with Django templates, as Reuven M. Lerner builds on last
month's column about the &ldquo;atfproject&rdquo; he started. Whether you want to
develop with Django or not, Reuven's lessons always are beneficial to the
new programmer and the seasoned developer alike. Dave Taylor follows with a
topic that is half scripting and half brain teaser. How can you make a
script to create the words in a word search? Is a brute-force, every
possible iteration solution the best way? Dave starts the script this
month and urges us to send him ideas.
</p><p>
Kyle Rankin continues last issue's article on Libreboot. We deal with the
operating systems (specifically Linux!) all the time, but Kyle dives deeper
and explains how to replace the system BIOS with an open alternative. My column isn't
nearly as low-level, but it addresses an often confusing concept for Linux
users&mdash;namely, system I/O. If STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR sound scary, fear
not. I explore I/O in all its glory and round things out with a clearer
understanding of pipes and redirects too.
</p><p>
You will get a really clear look at LUCI4HPC this month, as Melanie Grandits,
Axel S&uuml;ndermann and Christ Oostenbrink explain the lightweight
clustering system. Although clustering often is needed only in specialized
circumstances, it doesn't mean the process needs to be difficult. With a
friendly Web interface and high customization ability, LUCI4HPC might be
perfect for your needs.
</p><p>
Valentine Sinitsyn describes how to use Jailhouse this month. Although it
might seem like &ldquo;just another virtualization platform&rdquo;, Jailhouse is
designed with real-time virtualization in mind. For folks in system
automation, medical and telecommunications, real-time Linux is crucial.
Sadly, most virtualization systems don't handle real-time solutions very
well. If you need real-time solutions, but want the cost benefits of
virtualization, Jailhouse might be perfect.
</p><p>
Finally, Doc Searls tears open the &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; concept and
explores its
meaning, intent, current state and future. If you, or your users, are
concerned about who gets access to what data, Doc's column will be of
particular interest this month. 
</p><p>
In fact, as a Linux user, this entire issue
is full of articles that most likely will pique your interest. Whether you
want to rewrite the BIOS on your laptop or just want some free cash
(be sure to read my UpFront article on ChangeTip), this issue aims to
please. Add the product news, tech tips, kernel updates and so on, and you have
on your screen a great way to spend April 1st&mdash;no fooling!
