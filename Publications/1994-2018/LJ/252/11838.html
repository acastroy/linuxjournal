Userful Network Video Wall</h2></div></div><p>
Digital-display software provider Userful boasts that its new Network Video
Wall, which is able to support up to 25 displays from a single Core i7 PC,
will be the new benchmark for flexibility, affordability and simplicity in
the sector. Userful also calls this the first solution with the capability to
run multiple video walls throughout a building from a single PC or server.
The Userful Network Video Wall can be arranged in artistic, angled designs
or in a standard grid configuration. Typical installations include lobbies,
museums, restaurants, stadiums, transportation hubs, retail stores, college
campuses, control rooms, meeting rooms and briefing and broadcast centers.

JFrog's Artifactory Binary Repository Management Solution</h2></div></div><p>
Because today's software development and distribution is a wholly
continuous process that demands speed and agility, the need to make
flexible, precise and lightning-fast queries across the entire development
environment continues to grow. To enable this high-performance search
capability, JFrog announced a significantly enhanced Artifactory Binary
Repository Management Solution version 3.5, which features the
company's new Artifactory Query Language (AQL). AQL, proffers JFrog, is
the industry's first and only search tool to help developers, DevOps
and QA teams locate binaries based on any set of criteria, independent of
repository type or packaging format. Examples of AQL's &ldquo;exceedingly
specific searches&rdquo; include things like find all Docker images marked as deployed
in production, get the latest Web application binaries produced by a
certain build branch, retrieve all artifacts that have been downloaded more
than 1,000 times but have a newer improved version and so on.

Rob Thomas and Patrick McSharry's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Big Data Revolution</em></span> (Wiley)</h2></div></div><p>
The new Wiley book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Big Data Revolution</em></span> is a guide to improving performance,
making better decisions and transforming business through the effective
use of Big Data. In this collaborative work by Rob Thomas, IBM Vice
President of Big Data Products, and Patrick McSharry, an Oxford Research
Fellow, this book presents inside stories from varied industries that
demonstrate the power and potential of Big Data within the business realm.
As implied by its subtitle, <span   class="emphasis"><em>What farmers, doctors and insurance agents
teach us about discovering big data patterns</em></span>, the book focuses on how to
uncover patterns and insights. Readers are guided through tried-and-true
methodologies for getting more out of data and using it to the utmost
advantage. This book describes the major trends emerging in the field, the
pitfalls and triumphs being experienced, and the many considerations
surrounding Big Data, all while guiding readers toward better decision
making from the perspective of a data scientist. Companies are generating
data faster than ever before, and managing that data has become a major
challenge. With the right strategy, Big Data can be a powerful tool for
creating effective business solutions, but deep understanding is key
when applying it to individual business needs.

David Cuartiells Ruiz and Andreas Goransson's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Professional Android
Wearables</em></span> (Wrox)</h2></div></div><p>
The the next transformative wave of smart mobile devices will be wearables.
To help Android developers surf into the Pope's living room without
getting axed with wearables is the new Wrox book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Professional Android
Wearables</em></span> by David Cuartielles Ruiz and Andreas Goransson. The veteran
developers demonstrate how to use the Android Wear platform and
other techniques to build real-world apps for a variety of wearables
including smart bands, smart watches and smart glasses. In no time,
readers will grasp how wearables can connect them to the Internet in more
pervasive ways than with PCs, tablets or mobile devices; how to build code
using Google's Wear SDK for Android-enabled hardware devices; how Android
Wear and other Android development techniques are capable of building
several presented example projects; and much more.

The Document Foundation's LibreOffice</h2></div></div><p>
The Document Foundation is proud of the ninth major iteration of
LibreOffice, describing the new 4.4 release of its office suite as
possessing &ldquo;a lot of UX and design love&rdquo; and representing its
&ldquo;most beautiful&rdquo; version to date. Most notably, the user interface
has been improved significantly, and interoperability with OOXML file
formats has been extended. A sampling of other notable improvements
includes support of OpenGL transitions in Windows and improved
implementation of the new OpenGL, digital signing of PDF files during the
export process, installation of myriad free fonts, several new default
templates, visual editing of Impress master pages, better Track Changes
function in Writer, improved import filters and greatly expanded support
for media capabilities on each platform.

SUSE Enterprise Storage</h2></div></div><p>
The move from expensive, proprietary systems to more affordable,
open-source solutions is a well-worn path in our disruptive sector of the
IT world. The disruption team at SUSE widens that path nicely with SUSE
Enterprise Storage, a self-managing, self-healing, distributed
software-based storage solution for enterprise customers. Powered by the
Ceph open-source distributed storage solution, SUSE Enterprise Storage
leverages commodity, off-the-shelf servers and disk drives to build highly
scalable storage at a drastically reduced cost per unit. Based on the
Firefly version of Ceph, the fully featured SUSE Enterprise Storage is well
suited for object, archival and bulk storage, with features including cache
tiering, thin provisioning, copy-on-write cloning and erasure coding.
SUSE's solution is available as an option with SUSE OpenStack Cloud or
as a standalone storage solution.

Zato Source s.r.o.'s Zato</h2></div></div><p>
Zato Source self-describes its open-source ESB (Enterprise Service Bus) and
application server Zato 2.0 as written &ldquo;by pragmatists for

and &ldquo;not yet another system quickly stitched together by a vendor on
the wave of ESB/SOA hype&rdquo;, Zato can be used for building middleware and
back-end systems. Zato facilitates intercommunication across applications
and data sources spanning an organization's business or technical
boundaries and beyond, enabling users to access, design, develop or

new features, a few of which include a Dockerfile to install a
fully operational cluster of two servers, load-balancer and Web-admin in
ten
minutes; a wealth of new connection types; Redis-based REST

Proxmox Server Solutions GmbH's Proxmox Mail Gateway</h2></div></div><p>
One reason the Proxmox Mail Gateway from Proxmox Server Solutions GmbH
has experienced great success over its ten-year history is the application

ClamAV, Cyren's Zero-Hour Virus Outbreak Protection and the optional Avira.
Proxmox Mail Gateway 4.0 is the new version of Proxmox's e-mail security
system that, either on bare-metal or as a virtual appliance, protects e-mail
servers from spam, viruses, trojans and phishing e-mails and is managed
through an intuitive, Web-based interface. Version 4.0 features a complete
package update and is now based on Debian Wheezy 7.8.
