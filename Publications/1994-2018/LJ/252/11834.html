<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #252, April 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Recently there was some discussion about ways to ease the tired backs of
kernel maintainers. Apparently the <span   class="bold"><b>merge
windows</b></span> are times of great labor,
and some folks wanted to alert contributors to some preferable code
submission habits.
</p><p>
There were a variety of ideas, and <span   class="bold"><b>Kevin
Cernekee</b></span> summarized them in patch
form, but one key idea was that none of this advice really could be treated
as etched into stone. <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>Theodore Ts'o</b></span>, in particular,
pointed out that maintainers all have their own ways of doing things, and
that no general rules could be relied on universally to produce repeatable
results.
</p><p>
In general though, as Kevin posted, the merge window is not a great time to
submit new patches. The merge window is the time after a new kernel version
comes out and before the first -rc release. Developers either should avoid
submitting patches at that time, or as was also discussed, they at
least should not expect a reply to their patches, and they should avoid submitting
any patch a second time during that period, if the first one seems to go
unaccepted.
</p><p>
Kevin also posted a very rough calculation of when developers might expect
to see their code in an official kernel. If they submit code within the
first four -rc releases, they could expect to see their code in the next
official kernel release. If they submit code within the remaining four -rc
releases, they could expect to see it in the second following official
release. <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span> thought this calculation very valuable, though Linus
cautioned that it was really quite a rough estimate and highly dependent
on any given maintainer's particular patch acceptance habits.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Richard Weinberger</b></span> has suggested a security improvement aimed at attackers
who target forking servers, such as <span   class="bold"><b>httpd</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>sshd</b></span>. Apparently by creating
lots of forks, the attacker could make guesses about code locations in each
forked memory allocation. After enough tries, it potentially could find the
location of key code and launch a root shell in the parent process.
That would be bad.
</p><p>
Richard's idea was to identify if a child process dies due to a fatal
error and cause future forks to wait 30 seconds before executing. This
would cause the attack to take much more time, but would tend not to
inconvenience regular users.
</p><p>
There was some support for this idea and some opposition. <span   class="bold"><b>Pavel Machek</b></span>
came to believe that Richard's patch was only trying to slow the kernel
down in random ways, in the hope that it might help. But <span   class="bold"><b>Kees Cook</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Andy
Lutomirski</b></span> both felt that Richard's patch was highly targeted and would
not unduly delay user code.
</p><p>
Richard had gotten his original idea while exploring the intricacies of the
<span   class="bold"><b>offset2lib</b></span> weakness, which detailed a way for attacking code to identify
the location of user libraries in memory. Once this location is known,
there are relatively trivial ways to launch a root shell. Any technique by
which an attacker could gain knowledge of the location of code in memory,
therefore, must be considered a security hole and be fixed immediately. But,
it's not always clear exactly how best to prevent that information from
being seen.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>Arm</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Arm64</b></span> projects are experiencing a kind of growing
pain&mdash;some
incompatibilities between the /proc/cpuinfo files on both architectures
that are causing some user programs to lose portability.
</p><p>
Part of the problem is that the Arm64 developers need to incorporate all
APIs from Arm into their code if they want to maintain portability,
although
they really want to abandon those APIs in favor of better ones. In the
current case, the /proc/cpuinfo files will have to be brought in line with
each other, even if there's code out there that depends on their
differences.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Russell King</b></span> had a bit to say about the situation, in the form of a
cautionary tale:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
As ARM64 wants to be compatible with ARM32 (in that it wants to be able to
run ARM32 applications), ARM64 <span   class="emphasis"><em>has</em></span> to offer a compatible user API for
everything that is a user API.
</p><p>
That means you have to generate an ARM32 compatible /proc/cpuinfo, ARM32
compatible hwcap information, ARM32 compatible signal structures, ARM32
compatible everything else. Which means you basically need to have a copy
of the ARM32 core code in ARM64, even if you want a different native ARM64
user API.
</p><p>
This is <span   class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span> the reason why architectures like X86 decided it was
silly having separated 32- and 64-bit, and why they went through a process
of merging the two together. A lot of the code was identical, and a lot of
the 32-bit-specific code was needed for 64-bit to provide the 32-bit API.
</p><p>
Right now, you're finding out this the hard way, and hitting these API
problems in the process, and going &ldquo;oh fsck&rdquo; when you hit
them&mdash;quite
simply because you've backed yourselves into a corner over this. You have
established a different ARM64 API because you didn't want the ARM32 legacy,
but then you've found that you <span   class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> need the ARM32 legacy. Now you're in
the position of having to change the ARM64 API, possibly breaking ARM64
applications in the process.
</p></blockquote></div></div>

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Intercoms</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #252, April 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Ever since my &ldquo;tiny $20 tablet&rdquo; project (see my Open-Source
Classroom column in the
March 2015 issue), I've been looking for more
and more cool things to do with cheap Android devices. Although the few
obvious ones like XBMC or Plex remotes work well, I've recently found
that having Android devices around the house means I can gain back an
old-school ability that went out of style in the late 1980s&mdash;namely,
an intercom system.
</p><p>
If you remember the big white boxes screwed to the wall in the garage
and basement so you could talk to the person in the kitchen about making
sandwiches, you know exactly what I mean. With multiple Android devices
around the house, it means I can send an audible message quickly
without the need to call or text.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11834androidf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
There are several great intercom apps in the Google Play store,
like &ldquo;Intercom for Android&rdquo;, &ldquo;Intercom for
Android&rdquo; (yes, more
than one!), &ldquo;Tikl&rdquo; and so on. Each has its own set of advantages and
disadvantages. Some work well over great distance by using the Internet,
and some work with an ad hoc Wi-Fi connection between rooms. Whatever
your instant communication needs, the intercom idea is one worth
exploring, especially if you have multiple Android devices around your
house. Download a few apps today, and let me know when that sandwich
is done!

I love Bitcoin. It's not a secret; I've written about Bitcoin mining and
cryptocurrency in the past. I'm the first to admit, however, that we're at
the very beginning of the cryptocurrency age. Although it's becoming easier
and easier 
to use Bitcoin (see <a href="http://www.coinbase.com" target="_self">www.coinbase.com</a>, for example), the limited use cases
combined with the wild volatility of price make Bitcoin the wild wild west of
the financial world.
</p><p>
There are a few awesome ideas, however, that are brilliant in their
simplicity. Certainly things like the Humble Bundle folks integrating
Bitcoin purchasing and Overstock.com allowing Bitcoin purchases are great
first steps. Those are really just re-inventing the wheel, however, because we
already can buy things using existing forms of currency.
</p><p>
Enter ChangeTip.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11834changef1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Sending someone a tip or donation on the Internet generally has been done
with something like PayPal. That's all well and good, but it's fairly
cumbersome. The folks at <a href="http://www.changetip.com" target="_self">www.changetip.com</a> have made sending money over the
Internet extremely simple, and fun!
</p><p>
With its integration into Twitter, Facebook, GitHub, Google+, YouTube,
Reddit and more, ChangeTip makes sending money as simple as sending a Tweet.
Thanks to the world of OAUTH, you don't even need to create an account on
ChangeTip.com to claim or send funds. If you send money to people who
don't have accounts, they simply sign in to ChangeTip via the
social-media account from which you sent it to them, and the money will be
there waiting for
them. Oh, and the money? It's Bitcoin!
</p><p>
With its seamless integration to Coinbase, ChangeTip makes actual financial
transactions secure, simple, and did I mention simple? Check it out today
at <a href="http://changetip.com" target="_self">changetip.com</a>, or visit my personal page at
<a href="http://shawnp0wers.tip.me" target="_self">shawnp0wers.tip.me</a>. And, if you want incentive to try
it out, I
originally planned to include a bunch of &ldquo;one-time links&rdquo; in this article
that could be claimed for $1 each. It turns out that the one-time links expire
after a week. So although it might have been a great April Fool's joke, I
really want to give everyone a chance to claim some tips, so keep reading!
</p><p>
On April 1st, 2015, watch my personal Twitter account (@shawnp0wers), and
I'll tweet out some ChangeTip URLs worth actual money. Be the first to
click the link, and you will be the proud owner of $1 from yours truly.
I'll try to spread out the tweets throughout the day, so don't worry if you're
reading this after work. It probably won't be too late!
</p><p>
Due to its awesome use of cryptocurrency and social media, along with the
ease of use and ability to give money to folks who read my article, this
month's Editors' Choice award goes to ChangeTip. Let's change the world! 
</p><p>
(Note: I'm not asking for tips! I know many of you are really kind and
generous, so I want to make it perfectly clear that posting the link to my
ChangeTip page isn't my way of asking for tips. It's just so you can see
how simple ChangeTip is to use!)

Elon Musk is known to be particularly apprehensive about artificial

Although many of us are both excited and worried about the potential future

</p><p>
Heading over to <a href="http://computoser.com" target="_self">computoser.com</a> both delights and concerns me. Using
nothing more than algorithms and preloaded data, the Web site will generate
completely unique and oddly pleasant electronic music. I expected the
results to feel bland and single-dimensional, but honestly, some of the
songs are incredible and seem to relay emotion that obviously was never
there to begin with.

Although it might be the downfall of civilization and might mean
the unemployability of creative folks like myself, you can
taste the computer's creativity yourself. There's also an app

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: .NET?</h2>

No, really! While on a normal day, the word &ldquo;Microsoft&rdquo; can be used as an
antonym for &ldquo;Open&rdquo;, the world of .NET seems to be going legitimately open
source. I have to confess that my limited development knowledge doesn't
give me a full appreciation of the significance of .NET and ASP.NET
things being released into the open-source world the end of last year, but
seeing actual GitHub repositories of the core technologies is encouraging.
</p><p>
Are you a Linux developer interested in branching into .NET programming
now that it's open source? Are you a .NET developer who wants to develop
for non-Microsoft platforms now that it's officially supported? Do you
think Microsoft has done too little too late? Whatever your take, the .NET
Foundation seems to be doing more than just releasing source code; the
GitHub repositories are a significant step toward a real community. Check
out the wide selection of Git repositories at <a href="https://microsoft.github.io" target="_self">https://microsoft.github.io</a>.

<h2 class="title">Designing Foils with XFLR5</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #252, April 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
For any object moving through a fluid, forces are applied to the object
as the fluid moves around it. A fluid can be something like water,
or even something like the air around us. When the object is specifically
designed to maximize the forces that the fluid can apply, you can designate
these designs as airfoils. A more common name that most people would use
is a wing. The shape of a wing, or airfoil, determines the forces that
are applied to it when it moves through a fluid or the air. These forces
also depend on the speed of motion through the fluid and the direction
of flow around the airfoil. 
</p><p>
With all of these parameters, how can you
design airfoils? How do you optimize airfoils for a particular use? You
need some way of analyzing all of this information&mdash;specifically, you need
software that can run the numbers and do the calculations. There are very
complex pieces of software that can analyze hydrodynamic problems in the
abstract. But, with airfoils, you can limit the problem to such a degree
that the equations are greatly simplified. 
</p><p>
One of the software packages
available to do these kinds of calculations is XFLR5
(<a href="http://www.xflr5.com/xflr5.htm" target="_self">www.xflr5.com/xflr5.htm</a>). XFLR5 started as a
fork of the much older xfoils program, but it has been extended with extra
functionality. 
</p><p>
Installation on Debian-based distributions can be done
with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install xflr5
</pre>
</p><p>
That command should install the XFLR5 documentation package as well.
</p><p>
When you start XFLR5 the first time, it is not very flashy. In fact,
on my system, I end up with a plain black window. 
</p><p>
Although you can design
your own airfoil from scratch, doing so can be fairly tedious. It is much
easier to take a previously designed airfoil as a starting point and
make alterations. A good database of airfoil designs is located at the
UIUC Airfoil Coordinates Database, containing nearly 1,600 airfoils
(<a href="http://m-selig.ae.illinois.edu/ads/coord_database.html" target="_self">m-selig.ae.illinois.edu/ads/coord_database.html</a>). The
database contains DAT files, which contain the information you need to
use in XFLR5. They also have GIF files, allowing you to see what the
airfoil looks like before downloading the DAT file. Once you choose one,
download the related DAT file and open it in XFLR5 by clicking on the
menu item File&rarr;Open.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11834xflr5f1.large.jpg"><img src="11834xflr5f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Opening a DAT file loads the data and switches to the
polar view.
</p></div></div><p>
You can change the view to the OpPoint View by clicking the menu item
View&rarr;OpPoint View or by pressing the F5 key. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11834xflr5f2.large.jpg"><img src="11834xflr5f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The OpPoint View gives you a traditional cross-section view of an
airfoil.
</p></div></div><p>
At the bottom of the window, you can see airfoil characteristics, such as the
thickness. Let's say that the first design change you need to make is to
generate a thinner airfoil. You can do this by clicking the menu item
Design&rarr;Scale camber and thickness or pressing the F9 key. This pops
up a new window where you can change those characteristics. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11834xflr5f3.large.jpg"><img src="11834xflr5f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. A new window lets you change the thickness and camber of your
airfoil.
</p></div></div><p>
When you make your changes and click OK, XFLR5 will ask you if you
want to overwrite the current airfoil or if you want to create a new
one. If you choose to create a new one, you will be able to switch
between the various loaded airfoils using the drop-down at the top of
the window. 
</p><p>
Now, let's generate the polars to do some analysis on
this new airfoil that you created. The easiest way to do this is to click
the menu item Analysis&rarr;Batch Analysis. If you have a multi-core or
multi-CPU machine, you can select the Multi-threaded Batch Analysis
menu item instead to get it done more quickly. This pops up a new window
where you can select the range of Reynolds numbers to do the analysis
over, and the step size for each Reynolds number to use. 
</p><p>
You also can select whether to do this for only the current foil, or
you can do the analysis for a list of foils. Once you have all of the
parameters set, you can click on the Analyze button at the bottom
of the window. For each step, you will see an output message in the
top right-hand pane telling you how many iterations were needed for
convergence, and in the bottom left-hand pane, you will see the actual
plotted values for each iteration of each step. Once it finishes,
you can close this analysis window and go back to the main window. The
polar view will be opened automatically, showing you all of the polar
plots. You can select a single polar plot of interest by clicking on the
menu item Polars&rarr;Polar Graphs, and then selecting the graph you want to
see. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11834xflr5f4.large.jpg"><img src="11834xflr5f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. There are several polar graphs showing you the results of your
analysis.
</p></div></div><p>
Now that you have a foil and its polars calculated, you can move on
to three-dimensional analysis and look at a full wing design. Clicking
on the menu item File&rarr;Wing and Plane Design will pop up a new view
where you can design a new full wing. Within this new view, you will
need to click on the menu item Wing-Plane&rarr;Define a New Wing to open
up a new window to create your new wing. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11834xflr5f5.large.jpg"><img src="11834xflr5f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Once you analyze your airfoil, you can start designing a full wing.
</p></div></div><p>
You can give it a name and description, and set all kinds of
characteristics. You also can select sections of your wing and use
the airfoils that you designed in the earlier step to provide the
cross-sections of the wing along its length. Once you are happy, you can
click on the Save and Close button and see your new wing displayed in
the main window. 
</p><p>
You now need to test your wing and analyze how it will
behave when it starts moving through the air. Clicking on the menu item
Analysis&rarr;Analysis Definition will bring up a parameter window where
you can set up the details of your analysis. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11834xflr5f6.large.jpg"><img src="11834xflr5f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. You can do an analysis of the entire wing as a whole.
</p></div></div><p>
Once everything is set, click on the OK button to get back to
the main window. Depending on what you are trying to do, you may need to
set some advanced settings by clicking the menu item Analysis&rarr;Advanced
Settings. Here, you can change items like the maximum number of
iterations, the relaxation factor or the panel boundary conditions. 
</p><p>
The
final step is to set the number of sequential steps in the right-hand
pane, under the analysis settings section. Clicking the Analyze button
in the right-hand pane starts off the whole process. 
</p><p>
You also can design
an entire plane, which is made up of one or more wings as well as a tail and
fins. You can do this by clicking on the menu item Wing-Plane&rarr;Define
a New Plane. In this part of XFLR5, you can define your entire plane
and see how it behaves as a complete object.
</p><p>
With XFLR5, you now can design your very own aircraft wings. This tool
should be helpful for anyone, but especially for hobbyists who are
designing their own RC aircraft. Cost is no longer a barrier for letting
your creativity run wild. You might come up with a totally new, awesome
wing design. 
</p><p>
You can find more documentation at the main XFLR5 Web site,
which can help you do more complex analysis. Some of it was written
based on older versions, however, so the location of certain functions
within XFLR5 has moved, and you may need to do some investigative work
to figure out how to do similar tasks. But, it is definitely worth the
minor amount of work involved.
