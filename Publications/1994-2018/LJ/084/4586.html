coexisting. Recently, the Linux machine stopped allowing Telnet
sessions or direct (text) logins on the console. I'm receiving this

<span   class="bold"><b>util-linux</b></span> RPM), and you now have
a dependency problem since your binary was built for glibc 2.1.3,
and you have glibc 2.1.1. I'm not quite sure how the RPM was
installed, considering that it should have complained due to
library incompatibility. One possibility you should be looking at
is that someone accessed your system without your knowledge and
installed a modified /bin/login to compromise your system. If
that's not the case, re-install the util-linux package that came
with your RH 6.0 distribution (<b  >rpm -U --force</b>)
and you should be okay.  &mdash;Marc Merlin, marc_bts@valinux.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1120580.0x1218870"></a>CD-ROM Mounts...but Where?</h2></div></div><p>I'm trying to install Sun StarOffice 5.1 on my machine. I

/mnt/cdrom doesn't give you any errors you should be looking in

(text and graphic files) of an SQL 7.0 database (running on NT
Server) into a MySQL database running on Debian GNU/Linux. A
related question is how to best migrate ASP pages to a Debian (or
other version) Linux platform. Your guidance is greatly
appreciated.  &mdash;Carl Lawson, lawson@oz.net</p><p>First off, moving one database to another is not a trivial
task. It's like porting a program from one platform to another,
there are implementation-specific issues to consider. For example,
MySQL does not support some SQL features that Microsoft SQL Server
does. The easiest way to port this would be to dump the contents of
the SQL Server database to a text file, re-create the tables in
MySQL and then use the <span   class="bold"><b>mysqlimport</b></span>
command to read the data into your new database. Another option
would be to move the data programmatically, using Perl or Java with
ODBC. This would allow you to validate or manipulate the data
before inserting it. As for ASP, install Apache with mod_perl
support and then install the ASP module. For more information and
downloads, go to
