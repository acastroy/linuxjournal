    GnuCash developer, Robert Merkel, explains the functionality of

hear again and again is &ldquo;The only reason I keep Windows around is
for Quicken.&rdquo; Since 1997, the GnuCash Project (formerly known as
xacc) has been working to provide an accounting solution for Linux.
GnuCash 1.4, the current stable release, provides a simple,
easy-to-use but powerful home accounting system. Development
continues at a rapid rate, both through volunteers and employees of
Gnumatic
(<a href="http://www.gnumatic.com" target="_self">http://www.gnumatic.com/</a>),
a company formed to support the continued development, marketing
and productization of GnuCash and related projects.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2540580.0x2638608"></a>Obtaining and Installing GnuCash</h2></div></div><p>GnuCash is GPL software, so you can download the source code,
as well as RPMs, from the GnuCash web site
(<a href="http://www.gnucash.org" target="_self">http://www.gnucash.org/</a>).
Several distributions, including Mandrake, SuSE, Debian and Red
Hat, also include GnuCash as part of their systems. While GnuCash
requires the GNOME libraries, it will run quite happily with any
window manager, including KDE. The current stable version is 1.4.9,
but that may have changed by the time you read this. Versions 1.5.x
are the next development series. These are intended for those who
wish to get involved with where GnuCash is going, rather than its
use in production environments.</p><p>Building GnuCash can be a little problematic for some people
as it requires the installation of a couple of uncommon build
tools. In addition to a working GNOME development environment, you
need Perl, <span   class="bold"><b>guile</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>SWIG</b></span> (available from
<a href="http://www.swig.org" target="_self">http://www.swig.org/</a>) and
<span   class="bold"><b>g-wrap</b></span>, another tool now
maintained by Gnumatic and available from the Gnumatic web site.
The dependency on SWIG is likely to go away sometime in the next
development series (1.5.x). GnuCash uses the standard GNU build
environment, so compiling is just a matter of typing
<b  >./configure; make; make install</b>.</p><p>While GnuCash's primary development environment is Linux on
x86, it has been successfully compiled and run under virtually all
the architectures Linux supports, as well as FreeBSD/x86 and
Solaris/x86. It should also run on just about any platform to which
GNOME has been ported.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2540580.0x26389d0"></a>Remedial Accounting 101</h2></div></div><p>While many other low-end accounting programs use a
&ldquo;cashbook&rdquo; single-entry approach to accounting, GnuCash has
always used a double-entry accounting system. While slightly more
complex, double-entry accounting is a far more accurate accounting
technique. You'll find that double-entry is a powerful way of
organizing your finances. If you are already familiar with
double-entry accounting, you probably can't imagine working any
other way. While it's technically possible to use GnuCash for
single-entry accounting, you'd be crazy not to take advantage of
GnuCash's full abilities.</p><p>So, how does double-entry accounting work in GnuCash? Every
time you spend, receive or transfer money is a &ldquo;transaction&rdquo;.
When you write a check to pay your phone bill, that's a
transaction. When your paycheck goes into your account&mdash;another
transaction. When you go to the ATM to get some cash for a night
out, that's a transaction. When you buy a burger with that
cash...you guessed it, it's a transaction (whether it's practical
to account for personal burger purchases is another question). In
each case, money is transferred from one place to another, and the
amount taken from one place must exactly equal the amount put
somewhere else. Money never appears or disappears from thin
air.</p><p>Similarly, in GnuCash every transaction involves money
transferred from one account to another. &ldquo;Huh? Two accounts?&rdquo; I
hear you saying. &ldquo;Okay, for a bill payment one of those accounts
might be a checking account, but what's the other?&rdquo; Good question.
The answer is that &ldquo;accounts&rdquo; can be much more than checking or
credit card accounts. For instance, you can create an &ldquo;expense
account&rdquo; for &ldquo;Phone Bills&rdquo;. Therefore, paying a phone bill would
involve two entries, one in your checking account, and one in the
&ldquo;Phone Bill&rdquo; expense account. These amounts must exactly match,
something that GnuCash immediately checks. At this point, you might
think that making two separate entries is a pain. GnuCash, however,
lets you make both entries at the same time. More information on
double-entry accounting is available in the GnuCash documentation
(on-line at
<a href="http://gnucash.org/docs/C/xacc-doubleentry.html" target="_self">gnucash.org/docs/C/xacc-doubleentry.html</a>).</p><p>So, let's create some accounts in GnuCash and record a $100
phone bill payment. Start up GnuCash. If you installed from a
binary package there's probably a menu entry somewhere, but if
that's not set up just type <b  >gnucash</b> at a
command-line prompt. You'll see the main window. First, we'll need
to create some accounts. One way to do so is to click on the
&ldquo;New&rdquo; button in the toolbar, which brings up a dialog box for
creating accounts.</p><p>We'll create an account to represent our checking account. In
the dialog box, enter the account's details. Most of the fields are
self-explanatory, but there are a few that could use some
explanation. The &ldquo;Account Code&rdquo; is used to determine the order of
display in the main window and has no other effect on the account.
If you don't care what order they are displayed in, you can safely
leave it blank. &ldquo;Account Type&rdquo; is where things start to get
interesting. GnuCash has 11 different account types. Our checking
account is a &ldquo;bank&rdquo; account. Finally, you must select a &ldquo;parent
account&rdquo;. What's that? All will be revealed later, but for now
just select &ldquo;new top level one too&rdquo;.</p><p>Next, we'll create the &ldquo;Phone Bill&rdquo; expense account. Click
on the &ldquo;new&rdquo; button, and repeat the process. The currency for the
new account must be the same as for the bank account (transferring
between different currencies is performed using special
&ldquo;currency&rdquo; accounts). Make sure you set the type of the account
as &ldquo;expense&rdquo;. You should also select &ldquo;new top level account&rdquo;
for this account.</p><p>If you're going to pay a phone bill, you've already got some
money in your bank account. According to the rules of double-entry
accounting, that money had to come from somewhere, right?
Therefore, we create a special &ldquo;equity&rdquo; account. Repeat the
process you used to create the previous accounts, but call this one
&ldquo;My Equity&rdquo; and make it of type &ldquo;equity&rdquo;.</p><p>Now, enter the initial bank account balance. Open the
register for the newly created bank account by double-clicking on
the entry in the main window. The register shows all the
transactions and a running balance for the current account. At the
bottom of each register there is always a blank line to enter new
transactions. The column headings display transaction fields: date,
number, description, transfer (which account the transaction
involves transfer from/to), deposit, withdrawal and balance.</p><p>Let's say that your current balance is $1,000.00, and we'd
like to record that. The date is already set to today's date, so
there's no need to modify that field. Use the tab key or the mouse
to move to the next field, the description field, where we type
<b  >Opening Balance</b>. Next, we select the account
where we're transferring money from&mdash;the special &ldquo;My Equity&rdquo;
account. Enter the amount ($1,000.00) into the deposit field, and
press enter to record the transaction. A new blank transaction will
be created, and the balance will change to record the current
account balance.</p><p>Finally, enter the phone bill. Enter the appropriate
information in each field: check number, description of the
transaction and the other account involved in the transaction. The
transaction is recorded, the new balance for the account is
calculated and a new blank transaction is recorded.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2540580.0x2638ef8"></a>Creating an Account Hierarchy</h2></div></div><p>The simple example has covered most of what's needed to use
GnuCash to track your expenses. You can go ahead and create
expense, income, bank and cash accounts to meet your needs.
However, if you conduct a lot of different types of transactions
and end up with a bunch of accounts, there are going to be a lot of
accounts for fairly similar types of transactions. Wouldn't it be
convenient if you could somehow group these accounts? GnuCash lets
you do just that. In fact, GnuCash is designed around the concept
of a chart of accounts or account hierarchy, in which accounts are
placed in a tree structure.</p><p>For instance, wouldn't it make sense to group together all
the different sorts of utility bills, such as electricity, water
and phone? GnuCash can do that. First, create a general Utilities
expense account, just like you created the Phone Bill expense
account. Next, create an Electricity expense account, but this
time, in the &ldquo;parent account&rdquo; field of the dialog box, select
Utilities rather than &ldquo;New top level account&rdquo;. Repeat the process
to create a Water expense account under the Utilities
account.</p><p>And now let's just add an account for phone bills...uh, wait,
we already have one of those. What do we do now? Do we delete that
account, make a new one and re-enter all those transactions? No, we
can move the &ldquo;Phone Bill&rdquo; account to make it a child of the
Utilities account. In the main window, click on the Phone Bill
account, then either click on the &ldquo;edit&rdquo; toolbar button or right
click on the highlighted main window entry, and select &ldquo;edit
account&rdquo;. Either way, you bring up the &ldquo;edit account&rdquo; dialog box
where you can change any properties of the selected account. Change
the parent account to Utilities, and click &ldquo;OK&rdquo;. That's
it!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2540580.0x26390b0"></a>Importing from Quicken</h2></div></div><p>So far, we've assumed that we've never used accounting
software before. For many people that's not the case, and Quicken's
QIF format is probably the most common way that people export data
from their systems. Microsoft Money can also export QIF. Check the
documentation of your particular system to find out whether your
package can export QIF. Unfortunately, Quicken's QIF file has some
rather interesting &ldquo;features&rdquo; and design decisions (including
recording dates differently depending on your location), so
importing your data into GnuCash requires a little manual
intervention along the way.</p><p>GnuCash's on-line help system (accessible from the help menu)
covers the importation process in detail. In fact, the on-line help
system is a comprehensive guide to all of GnuCash's features and
gives quite a lot of accounting background, not just the details of
GnuCash's operation. To use the on-line help just select &ldquo;help&rdquo;
from the main window. Many dialog boxes also have a help button
available.</p><p>In any case, let's assume you have exported a QIF file with
all your accounts, that you want to import to GnuCash. From the
GnuCash main window, go to the File menu and select &ldquo;import QIF&rdquo;,
which brings up the import dialog box. First, select the QIF file
you wish to import, and select the default currency for this QIF
file. Next, give a name to the default account, and specify the
currency in which this QIF records transactions. Then, click on
&ldquo;load file&rdquo;. If you have multiple QIF files you wish to import at
once, repeat the process.</p><p>The QIF importer then examines the QIF files, creates an
account structure that matches the original QIF categories and
accounts with GnuCash accounts, and checks for any duplicate
transactions. This is quite a complex process so don't be concerned
if it takes a while and GnuCash doesn't respond to user input. It
also guesses the appropriate account type for each category. While
the QIF importer usually guesses correctly, it's wise to check. You
can also add descriptions and change the parent of accounts. If you
want to do this later, you can do it from the main window. Anyway,
when you've checked everything just click OK, and importation will
be complete!</p><p>You can also import QIF into existing GnuCash files. Use the
same process as above, but this time you'll probably have to use
the &ldquo;accounts&rdquo; and &ldquo;categories&rdquo; tabs of the QIF importer to
tell GnuCash in which of your existing accounts to place various
transaction categories. These days, many banks are able to provide
QIF files representing all transactions in an account over a period
of time. You can use the QIF importer to import those transactions
automatically into the system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2540580.0x2639318"></a>Reconciliation</h2></div></div><p>GnuCash can also assist you in reconciling your records
against your bank statement. When you receive a bank statement,
just choose that account and then right click and select
&ldquo;reconcile&rdquo;. Tell GnuCash the ending balance on the statement,
and the reconcile window is displayed (see Figure 1).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4567f1.large.jpg"><img src="4567f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. The Reconcile Window automates the process
of reconciling your records against your bank's.</p></div></div>
</p><p>You should then go through your bank statement, and check the
uncleared transactions against the transactions on the statement.
If they match (and the amounts are correct) click that transaction
to clear it. When the process is complete, the difference field at
the bottom of the window should be $0.00. If it isn't, there's a
discrepancy between your record and the bank's. Either you've
missed a transaction (have you checked the bank's fees and
government charges?), an amount is wrong or the bank has made an
error (possible, but unlikely).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2540580.0x2639688"></a>Stocks and Other Investments</h2></div></div><p>GnuCash has extensive facilities for tracking investments in
stocks and mutual funds. When you purchase a new stock or open a
mutual fund, you should open a stock or a mutual fund account, just
like a bank account. When you open the account, make sure you enter
the correct ticker symbol in the Security field, and select a
source quote.</p><p>While automated, updating prices is done from outside GnuCash
with the <span   class="bold"><b>gnc-prices</b></span> Perl script.
When the script is run, all the available prices are
updated.</p><p>Recording stock purchases and sales is performed using the
stock account register, which works just like the other registers
except you should enter a price and a quantity of shares/units
instead of just one value.</p><p>What? You want to analyze the performance of your shares? For
that, you need...</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2540580.0x26398f0"></a>Reports</h2></div></div><p>GnuCash has some very useful reporting capabilities that you
can view directly or export as HTML for permanent storage or
printing. Current CVS has direct printing support through
gnome-print, but this has not made it into release versions
yet.</p><p>One of the most basic reports is the &ldquo;balance sheet&rdquo;. This
report summarizes your assets and liabilities, thus showing your
net worth. To display the report, simply select &ldquo;Balance Sheet&rdquo;
from the report menu. A report window will open and display the
report. By default, it displays the balance sheet as of this
moment, but that's adjustable. Click on the &ldquo;parameters&rdquo; button,
which brings up a dialog box from which you can change options for
the report.</p><p>An overview of your stock portfolio is also available, as
well as the account balance tracker, a very useful report for
tracking the growth of a specific stock or mutual fund. This report
also supports graphing if you have
<span   class="bold"><b>gnuplot</b></span> installed. Finally, the
transaction report lists all transactions meeting a set of
criteria. This flexible report is often useful for extracting
specific information not available in other reports (see Figure
2).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4567f2.large.jpg"><img src="4567f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. The Transaction report can be used to
display and subtotal transactions in a variety of
ways.</p></div></div>
</p><p>If the current reports do not meet your needs, you can write
your own. The &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; report is the GnuCash authors' test
bed and serves as a basis for those who wish to write a custom
report.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2540580.0x26305f8"></a>Future Plans</h2></div></div><p>While GnuCash is stable and useful right now, Gnumatic and
the rest of the GnuCash community have big goals for the future.
Already, the development CVS tree has several new features, and
many more are planned.</p><p>The coming 2.0 release is under heavy development, and plans
are afoot for a Q1 2001 release. Some of the features that will be
part of 2.0 include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A new, XML-based file format that will be more
compact and versatile.</p></li><li><p>Printable reports (courtesy of gnome-print and the
gtkhtml widget).</p></li><li><p>Better graph capabilities through GUPPI (which will
hopefully be widely adopted as the standard Gnome graph
infrastructure). Development of GUPPI has been supported by
Gnumatic.</p></li><li><p>Much improved report flexibility and
customizability.</p></li><li><p>Much improved stock market reporting.</p></li></ul></div><p>Further improvements to GnuCash's personal accounting
abilities are planned in the long term. Some of these include:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Improvements to on-line stock quote gathering and
currency quotes.</p></li><li><p>Interfacing to on-line banking, including OFX and
other standards.</p></li><li><p>Interfacing to Palm PDAs.</p></li><li><p>Full documentation of the guile API to make writing
extensions easy.</p></li></ul></div>

While GnuCash's current emphasis is on personal accounting, the
large number of requests for business accounting functionality we
receive on the mailing list are not being ignored. GnuCash will
form the basis of a full-featured, multiuser accounting package
with a database engine; CORBA bindings; and support for payroll,
inventory, invoicing and the other features that larger businesses
require from accounting systems. Gnumatic will be in the forefront
of this, offering its services to customize and support GnuCash for
specific customers, industries and countries.
