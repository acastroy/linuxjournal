firewalling, particularly with the advent of low-cost, always-on
high-speed Internet connections and associated security risks. Many
of us here are familiar with the poor but educated man's approach
to the problem: drop a Linux distro on a machine with a pair of
NICs and configure appropriately. This is cheap, effective,
reasonably secure, but also time-consuming and doesn't scale all
that well. It's fine for Joe Hobbyist, but Mike the Network Manager
wants something a little easier to handle.</p><p>Enter Watchguard. This Seattle-based company makes a line of
dedicated firewall appliances to serve anything from the SOHO
market to a 5,000-user mega-office with up to 100 branches on
Virtual Private Networks connected securely across the Internet.
Bundled with the bigger boxes is their LiveSecurity System, a
GUI-based manager tool that allows the network manager to easily
configure the local firewall, called a Firebox, and optionally, VPN
Manager, which allows management of multiple VPNs as well as any
Fireboxes (including the SOHOs) that happen to be on the other end
of the VPN link. As you might have guessed, the larger Fireboxes
run Linux. (The SOHOs run VxWorks.) At $4,990 US for a full-sized
one, it's not cheap at all but, as I was to find out, it is
easy.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c3580.0x21bbc38"></a>Initial Impressions</h2></div></div><p>The Firebox II arrived in a nice carry-handle box with all
the cables needed to hook it up, including an RJ-45 crossover cable
for setup, RJ-45 patch cords for the rest of the network and a
serial cable for direct console setup with appropriate adapters for
DB9 or DB25 connectors. The fire-engine red case also comes with a
pair of metal flanges that, when you rearrange them appropriately,
allow the Firebox to be mounted in a standard 19", 2U rack slot.
The front panel has an array of LEDs for system status, traffic and
load average; the back panel has three RJ-45 10/100Tx jacks, a pair
of DB9 serial ports, a pair of Type II PCMCIA modem slots, power
socket and switch. (I always liked the idea of the switch on the
front, but that's just me.) Under the hood lies a custom
single-board computer with a 200MHz Pentium MMX, 64MB of SDRAM, an
8MB Flash ROM and two noisy but effective fans. Instead of a CPU
fan, there is a monster heat sink, and one of the case fans is
aimed directly at it. I suppose this is so the unit can survive the
loss of one of the fans; using a smaller fanned-heat sink would
give the unit a single point of failure.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4593f1.jpg"></div><p>The manual is a nice 300-page spiral-bound volume about the
size of a trade paperback. What lay inside, though, was the big
surprise&mdash;Windows?!? <span   class="emphasis"><em>You need Microsoft Windows to run
this software.</em></span>
</p><p>A query to Watchguard's tech support web page netted me a
pair of answering phone calls, verifying what the manual said.
There is currently no way to set up the big Fireboxes without using
Microsoft Windows. But, they said, we would be happy to have you
visit our training facility and show you how things work.</p><p>On-site at Watchguard, we get down to business. We put the CD
in the drive, the install ran, did its normal Windowsish thing
(including a reboot) and now we're looking at the configurator for
the Firebox. You can configure it for drop-in mode (where it does
transparent proxy like a bridge) or routed mode, which allows the
trusted network to have private addresses, to which the Firebox
will port-forward, if so desired. With all the requisite magic
numbers in place, we pressed the button to upload and booted the
Firebox. Hmmm, uploading via TCP didn't work. Not to worry, you can
also upload via the console port. Back up a click, reset for COM1
and up pops the progress box. Ahh, sweet success. A reboot under
software control, and the Firebox is up and running. We verified
that it would communicate over the trusted interface then used a
pre-configured Firebox to address it over the external interface,
set up an IPSec gateway and tunnel. The optional VPN Manager is
really slick; you simply give it the remote address and
configuration password of the remote Firebox, then drag one Firebox
icon onto another, run through three clicks worth of configuration
and the tunnel is configured; a quick reset (20-30 seconds) on each
Firebox, and the tunnel is active. The VPN tunnels can be filtered
in all the same ways you can filter regular IP traffic: by host, by
port or both, on source, destination or both. The Firebox II client
can also configure SOHO units remotely, so a network admin can
manage his or her telecommuters as well as big branches.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4593f3.jpg"></div><p>I asked some pointed questions about the safety of uploading
new configurations and got a neat insight into the Firebox's
internal architecture. The Flash ROM is divided into several
sections: the running configuration, the underlying Linux system, a
backup area where these can be saved (and recovered) during
upgrades and a &ldquo;system&rdquo; area, which is the moral equivalent of a
rescue partition. You tell the configurator you want to restore the
factory default configuration, then reboot the system with the
console port connected to your serial port. The configurator
detects the boot prompt and tells the system to boot from the
system area, at which point you reconfigure the machine from
scratch. You can also boot the box with a PCMCIA modem in one of
its slots and (re-)configure the machine from remote dialup. This
makes for easy physical deployment of a large VPN; all the person
at the remote site has to do is insert various sets of tab &ldquo;A&rdquo;
into slot &ldquo;B&rdquo; (and the cables are all color-coded) and turn it
on, and the network admin sitting in the home office in Sioux City
can take it from there.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c3580.0x21bc108"></a>Saving Grace</h2></div></div><p>This is all well and good for larger companies with
heterogenous networks, but what about us Linux-only types with a
relatively tiny network and budget? (After all, the Firebox II is
rated at 500 users and costs five grand.) Not to worry. Remember
those SOHOs? Well, they don't run Linux, but they do
<span   class="bold"><b>grok</b></span> it...as a matter of fact, any
SSL-capable browser can configure a SOHO. The configuration screens
are all straight, low-graphics HTML, so, while it doesn't look as
fancy as the Windows client, you could even talk to it with Lynx
patched for OpenSSL. They're also a lot more affordable, with an
MSRP of $449 US for a ten-user version. It's about the size and
shape of an 8-port hub with a built-in 4+1-port hub on the back and
a few status LEDs in the front.</p><p>All the Fireboxes do NAT, logging, DHCP both client and
server, logging to a remote host, remote setup of one form or
another and, if you're stuck with it, PPP over Ethernet. VPN is
standard on the big boxes, and a $100 US option on the SOHOs.
(Interestingly enough, the VPNs use IPSec and a few other
protocols, but not Microsoft's PPTP. Why? That's right. Microsoft
wasn't forthcoming with the standards.) The big boxes also perform
scan and spoofing detection. All of them come with a year's
subscription to LiveSecurity, a &ldquo;push&rdquo; service that delivers
security updates, both human readable and in software form, via
e-mail or directly to the configuration host. Network managers can
then upload the software at their convenience. Your subscription
also gets you access to the tech support web pages, which include
both a knowledge base and a trouble-ticket submission and tracking
interface. The license key is also your password to get tech
support on the phone. (Don't lose that card!)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c3580.0x21bc2c0"></a>The Future of the Firebox</h2></div></div><p>Watchguard said they were working on ways to minimize the
number of times you had to reset a Firebox after a configuration
change; this makes sense since you can do almost anything except
change kernels to a standard Linux machine without resorting to a
reboot. They also hinted that there might be Linux in the SOHO's
future. For the foreseeable future, however, the big Fireboxes will
require a Windows host to configure. Watchguard's primary focus is
to make it as easy as possible to deploy a network on a truly grand
scale and manage it with a minimum of fuss.</p><p>They've done that to a certain extent already. As the old saw
goes: good, cheap, fast&mdash;choose any two. This isn't cheap, but I
think with the dual solution of the Firebox IIs for large,
heterogenous networks and the SOHOs for small or Linux-only
implementations, a network admin can make a case for these drop-in
machines in terms of saved people-time, both up-front and on an
ongoing basis. It's not a perfect solution, particularly not for
the purists among us, but I think it's a step in the right
direction. Not bad for a company &ldquo;only&rdquo; five years old.</p><p><a href="4593s1.html" target="_self">The Good/The Bad</a></p></div></div>
