    An explanation of the mix-in programming style as applied in
    Python.

development where units of functionality are created in a class and
then mixed in with other classes. This might sound like simple
inheritance at first, but a mix-in differs from a traditional class
in one or more of the following ways. Often a mix-in is not the
&ldquo;primary&rdquo; superclass of any given class, does not care what class
it is used with, is used with many classes scattered throughout the
class hierarchy and is introduced dynamically at runtime.
</p><p>There are several reasons to use mix-ins: they extend
existing classes in new areas without having to edit, maintain or
merge with their source code; they keep project components (such as
domain frameworks and interface frameworks) separate; they ease the
creation of new classes by providing a grab bag of functionalities
that can be combined as needed; and they overcome a limitation of
subclassing, whereby a new subclass has no effect if objects of the
original class are still being created in other parts of the
software.</p><p>So while mix-ins are not a distinct technical feature of
Python, the benefits of this technique are worth studying.</p><p>Python provides an ideal language for mix-in development
because it supports multiple inheritance, supports full-dynamic
binding and allows dynamic changes to classes. Before we dive into
Python, let me admit that mix-ins are old hat. The first time I saw
mix-in programming by that name was when reviewing the now-defunct
Taligent Project, known for its Pink operating system and
CommonPoint application framework. However, since C++ does not
support language feature #2, full-dynamic binding, or language
feature #3, dynamic changes at runtime, I'm not surprised that the
approach didn't bring to fruition all its inventors had hoped
for.</p><p>I have also seen another instance of mix-in programming under
a different name. Objective-C has a nifty language feature called
categories that allows you to add and replace methods of existing
classes, even without access to their source code.</p><p>This is great for repairing existing system classes and
extending their capabilities. Also, combined with an ability to
load libraries dynamically, categories are quite effective in
improving the structure of applications and reducing code.</p><p>The grapevine informs me that Symbolics' object-oriented
Flavors system is most likely the earliest appearance of bona fide
mix-ins. The designers were inspired by Steve's Ice Cream Parlor in
Cambridge, Massachusetts where customers started with a basic
flavor of ice cream (vanilla, chocolate, etc.) and added any
combination of mix-ins (nuts, fudge, chocolate chips, etc.). In the
Symbolics system, large, standalone classes were known as flavors
while smaller helper classes designed for enhancing other classes
were known as mix-ins. A reference can be found on the Web at
<a href="http://www.kirkrader.com/examples/cpp/mixin.htm" target="_self">www.kirkrader.com/examples/cpp/mixin.htm</a>.</p><p><a href="4540s1.html" target="_self">Objective-C: I Knew Him
Well</a></p><p><a href="4540s2.html" target="_self">Python 2.0</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1664580.0x175c978"></a>Python Capabilities</h2></div></div><p>Having paid our respects to the dead (Taligent), nearly dead
(Objective-C) and legendary (Symbolics), let's start digging into
the features that make Python a great language for mix-in
programming. For one, Python supports multiple inheritance. That
is, in Python, a class can inherit more than one class:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
class Server(Object, Configurable):
    pass
</pre><p>also, Python supports full-dynamic binding. When passing a
message to an object such as:
<pre     class="programlisting">
obj.load(filename)
</pre>


Python will determine, entirely at runtime, what method to invoke,
based on the name of the message and the class inheritance of obj.
This behavior works as expected and is easy to remember. It
continues to work even if the class inheritance or method
definitions are altered at runtime.
</p><p>One thing to keep in mind is the order of searching with
regard to multiple inheritance. The search order goes from left to
right through the base classes, and for any given base class, goes
deep into its ancestor classes.</p><p>When you create mix-ins, keep in mind the potential for
method names to clash. By creating distinct mix-ins with well-named
methods you can generally avoid any surprises. Lastly, Python
supports dynamic changes to the class hierarchy.</p><p>Most Python &ldquo;things&rdquo;, whether they are lists, dictionaries,
classes or instances, have a set of accessible attributes. Python
classes have an attribute named __bases__, which is a tuple of
their base classes. Consistent with Python design, you can play
with it at runtime. In the following session with the Python
interactive interpreter seen in Listing 1, we create two classes
and then later change the inheritance. Our person in Listing 1
isn't very friendly so let's change it. In fact, let's change all
people so that we'll never have this problem again:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;&lt;&lt; Person.__bases__ += (Friendly,)
&lt;&lt;&lt; p.hello()
Hello
</pre><p><a href="4540l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Installing a Mix-in
Dynamically</a>
</p><p>The first statement above changes the base classes of Person.
By using <b  >+=</b> (as opposed to <b  >=</b>)
we avoid accidentally removing existing base classes, especially if
a future version of the code makes Person inherit from another
class. Also, the funny looking expression,
<b  >(Friendly,)</b>, specifies a tuple that would
normally simply be enclosed in parenthesis. However, while Python
readily recognizes &lt;If&ldquo;Courier&rdquo;&gt;(x,y)&lt;I$f$&gt; as a tuple
of two elements, it recognizes &lt;If&ldquo;Courier&rdquo;&gt;(x)&lt;I$f$&gt;
as a parenthesized expression. Appending the comma forces tuple
recognition.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1664580.0x175cef8"></a>MySQLdb Cursor Mix-ins</h2></div></div><p>The most straightforward way to apply mix-ins is at design
time within the construction of a module. One of the more famous
third-party modules for Python, MySQLdb, does exactly this.</p><p>Python defines a standard programmatic interface for database
access named DB API
(<a href="http://www.python.org/topics/database" target="_self">http://www.python.org/topics/database/</a>).
Andy Dustman's MySQLdb module implements this interface so that
Python programmers can make connections and send queries to a MySQL
server. It can be found at
<a href="http://dustman.net/andy/python/MySQLdb" target="_self">http://dustman.net/andy/python/MySQLdb/</a>.</p><p>MySQLdb provides three major features for the cursor objects
it creates. It reports warnings when necessary; it stores result
sets on the client side or uses them on the server side as needed,
and it returns results as tuples (e.g., immutable lists) or
dictionaries.</p><p>Rather than combining all of these into one monolithic class,
MySQLdb defines mix-in classes for each of them:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
class CursorWarningMixIn:
class CursorStoreResultMixIn:
class CursorUseResultMixIn
class CursorTupleRowsMixIn:
class CursorDictRowsMixIn(CursorTupleRowsMixIn):
</pre><p>Remember that mix-ins are classes, so they can take advantage
of inheritance, as we see with CursorDictRowsMixIn, which inherits
CursorTupleRowsMixIn.
</p><p>None of the mix-ins above can stand on their own: a
BaseCursor class provides the required core functionality for any
type of cursor. Using these mix-ins in combination with BaseCursor,
MySQLdb offers every combination of warnings, storage and result
types (eight in all). When creating a database connection, you can
pass the cursor class you desire:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
conn = MySQLdb.connection (cursorclass=MySQLdb.DictCursor)
</pre><p>Mix-ins don't only help in the creation of MySQLdb itself.
They also make it more extensible by allowing you to pick and
choose features for your own custom cursor classes.
</p><p>Note that these class names are suffixed with MixIn to
emphasize their nature. Another common convention is to append
&ldquo;-able&rdquo; or &ldquo;-ible&rdquo; to the end of the name as in Configurable or
NamedValueAccessible.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1664580.0x175d3c8"></a>NamedValueAccessible</h2></div></div><p>Let's use that last one as an example. The
NamedValueAccessible mix-in adds the method valueForKey( ) to
whatever class with which it is joined. For obj.valueForKey(name),
this method will return one of the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>obj.name( )</p></li><li><p>obj._name( )</p></li><li><p>obj.name</p></li><li><p>obj._name</p></li></ul></div><p>In other words, valueForKey( ) looks for methods or
attributes, either public or private, in order to return a value
for the given key. The design of this method reflects the fact that
Python objects often provide information through both attributes
and methods. See Listing 2 for the implementation.
</p><p><a href="4540l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. A Mix-in for Uniform
Value Access</a></p><p>A useful application of this mix-in is to implement generic
code for writing logs (see Listing 3).</p><p><a href="4540l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Applying the
NamedValueAccessible Mix-in for Logging</a></p><p>By simply adding new keys to the logColumns( ) method, the
log can be expanded without having to modify the code that
generates it, which is found in logEntry( ). More importantly, you
can imagine that logColumns( ) could read its list of fields from a
simple configuration file.</p><p>The transaction object itself is free to provide the given
values via either methods or attributes, due to the flexibility of
the valueForKey( ) method. Making mix-ins flexible increases their
utility and is an art that can be developed over time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1664580.0x175daa8"></a>Mixing It in after the Fact</h2></div></div><p>So far we have seen examples of using mix-ins during the
construction of classes. However, Python's dynamic nature also
allows us to mix in functionality at runtime. The simplest
technique for doing so is to modify the base classes of the given
class, as described earlier. A function allows us to keep this
operation opaque and enhance it later if need be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
def MixIn(pyClass, mixInClass):
    pyClass.__bases__ += <b  >mixInClass</b>
</pre><p>Let's consider a situation that makes the utility of MixIn( )
obvious. In the construction of internet applications, keeping
domain classes separate from interface classes is generally a good
idea. Domain classes represent the concepts, data and operations of
a specific application. They are independent of operating system,
user interface, database, etc. Some writers refer to domain objects
as business objects, model objects or problem space objects.
</p><p>Keeping the domain and interface separate makes sense for
various reasons. An individual focus is created for two key areas
that are largely independent: What is the subject material of the
problem? And, how should that be presented? New interfaces can be
constructed without modifying or rewriting the domain classes. In
fact, multiple interfaces can be provided.</p><p>Domain classes for a story publishing system might include
Story, Author and Site. These classes contain essential attributes
(such as title, body, name, e-mail, etc.) and various operations
(save, load, publish, etc.).</p><p>One interface for such a system could be a web site that
allows users to create, edit, delete and publish these stories.
When developing such a site, it would be useful if our domain
classes, such as Story, have the methods renderView( ) and
renderForm( ), which write HTML for either displaying the story or
editing it with a form.</p><p>Using mix-ins, we can develop such functionality outside of
the domain classes:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
class StoryInterface:
    def renderView(self):
        # write the HTML representation of the story
        pass
    def renderForm(self):
        # write the HTML form to edit the story
        pass
</pre><p>And within the code that backs the web site, mix it in like
so:
<pre     class="programlisting">
from MixIn import MixIn
from Domain.Story import Story
MixIn(Story, StoryInterface)
</pre>


If you decide to create a GUI interface for the publishing system,
you don't have to take the HTML machinery with you (or vice versa).
The domain classes focus on providing necessary data and
operations, ensuring that when developing the GUI, you will have
what you need.
</p><p>One could argue that a new class might be created to bring
the two together:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
class StoryInterface:
    ...
from Domain.Story import Story
class Story(Story, StoryInterface): pass
</pre><p>Or one could argue that StoryInterface might be made a
subclass of Story in order to achieve the same benefit. However,
consider the case when Story already has other domain subclasses:
<pre     class="programlisting">
class Story: ...
class Editorial(Story): ...
class Feature(Story): ...
class Column(Story): ...
</pre>


Existing subclasses of Story are in no way affected by simply
creating a new Story class or subclass. But a dynamic mix-in for
Story will also affect Editorial, Feature and Column. That is why
many times the static approach does not work in practice, thereby
making the dynamic approach not only clever, but necessary.
</p><p>Also, consider the case where Story objects are created in
parts of the code where Story is hard-coded. While poor practice,
this is common. In this situation, creating subclasses of Story
will have no effect on the code that ignores them.</p><p>One warning regarding dynamic mix-ins: they can change the
behavior of existing objects (because they change the classes of
those objects). This could lead to unpredictable results, as most
classes are not designed with that type of change in mind. The safe
way to use dynamic mix-ins is to install them when the application
first starts, before any objects are created.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1664580.0x1b56380"></a>Advanced Versions of MixIn( )</h2></div></div><p>The first enhancement we can add to MixIn( ) is to check that
we're not mixing in the same class twice:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
def MixIn(pyClass, mixInClass):
    if mixInClass not in pyClass.__bases__
        pyClass.__bases__ += (mixInClass,)
</pre><p>In practice, I find more often than not, that I want my
mix-in methods to take a high priority, even superseding inherited
methods if needed. The next version of the function puts the mix-in
class at the front of the sequence of base classes but allows you
to override this behavior with an optional argument:
<pre     class="programlisting">
def MixIn(pyClass, mixInClass, makeLast=0):
  if mixInClass not in pyClass.__bases__
    if makeLast:
      pyClass.__bases__ += (mixInClass,)
    else:
      pyClass.__bases__ = (mixInClass,) + pyClass.__bases__
</pre>


To make Python invocations more readable, I suggest using keyword
arguments for flags:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# not so readable:
MixIn(Story, StoryInterface, 1)
# much better:
MixIn(Story, StoryInterface, makeLast=1)
</pre>


<a href="4540l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. Our Final Version of
MixIn</a>
</p><p>This new version still doesn't allow methods in the actual
class to be overridden with methods in the mix-in. In order to
accomplish that, the mix-in methods must actually be installed in
the class. Fortunately, Python is dynamic enough to accomplish
this. Listing 4 gives the source code for our final version of
MixIn( ). By default it will install the methods of the mix-in
directly into the target class, even taking care to traverse the
base classes of the mix-in. The invocation is the same:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
MixIn(Story, StoryInterface)
</pre><p>An extra makeAncestor=1 argument can be provided for the new
MixIn( ) to get the old semantics (e.g., make the mix-in a base
class of the target class). The ability to put the mix-in at the
end of the base classes has been removed, since I have never needed
this in practice.
</p><p>An even more sophisticated version of this function could
return (perhaps optionally) a list of methods that clash between
the two, or raise an exception accompanied by such a list, if the
overlap exists.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1664580.0x1b567a0"></a>Installing Mix-ins Automatically</h2></div></div><p>When making heavy use of after-the-fact mix-ins, invocations
of the MixIn( ) function become repetitious. For example, a GUI
application might have a mix-in for every domain class in
existence, thereby requiring a call such as this for each
one:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
from Domain.User import User
MixIn(User, UserMixIn)
</pre><p>One solution is to bind the mix-ins to their target classes
by name and have the application install these at startup. For
example, all mix-ins could be named directly after the class they
modify and put into a MixIns/ directory. The code in Listing 5 will
install them.
</p><p><a href="4540l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5. Detecting and Installing
Mix-ins Named after Their Classes</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1664580.0x1b56a08"></a>Additional Uses</h2></div></div><p>While it's fun to explore more sophisticated versions of the
MixIn( ) function, the most important key is the ability to apply
them in order to improve your software. Here are some additional
uses to stimulate your imagination:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A class could augment itself with a mix-in after
reading a configuration file. For example, a web server class could
mix in Threading or Forking depending on how it's
configured.</p></li><li><p>A program could provide for plug-ins: software
packages that are located and loaded at launch time to enhance the
program. Those who implement plug-ins could make use of MixIn( ) to
enhance core program classes.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1664580.0x1b56cc8"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>Mix-ins are great for improving modularity and enhancing
existing classes without having to get intimate with their source
code. This in turn supports other design paradigms, like separation
of domain and interface, dynamic configuration and plug-ins.
Python's inherent support for multiple inheritance, dynamic binding
and dynamic changes to classes enables a very powerful technique.
As you continue to write Python code, consider ways in which
mix-ins can enhance your software.</p></div></div>
