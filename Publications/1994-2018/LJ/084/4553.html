    &ldquo;Habitability is the characteristic of source code that enables programmers...coming to the code later in its life, to understand its construction and intentions and to change it comfortably and confidently....Habitability makes a place livable, like home.&rdquo; --Richard Gabriel
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29fc580.0x2af42f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>We can't talk about software without
borrowing the language of construction. We call ourselves builders,
designers, architects and engineers. We speak of structures,
spaces, objects, frameworks, levels, partitions, elements,
components and platforms. We assemble developing software into
builds. Finished work takes on the rhetoric of real estate when we
build sites with addresses and locations.
</p><p>So what's going on here, beyond promiscuous linguistic
leverage? For a while I've insisted that it means the software
industry is maturing into a construction industry&mdash;one defined by
skilled and reputable practitioners rather than by the sole-source
suppliers we call &ldquo;platform providers&rdquo;. In a mature software
industry, Microsoft will be no more or less important than, say,
Georgia Pacific or Kaufman &amp; Broad.</p><p>In the construction industry, open source is standard. When
building materials and methods aren't secret, there's more to talk
about, more people involved in the conversation and more people
contributing to the improvement of those materials and methods.
This is a bit more low-falutin' than the peer review process that
Eric Raymond talks about, but it's the same thing. Peer review
happens constantly in every living, growing industry, at every
level. Consider <span   class="emphasis"><em>Architectural Graphic
Standards</em></span>, a sourcebook for design and construction
details first published in 1932. More than half its contents are
new or revised every seven years.</p><p>The software industry is just a few decades old while
construction is as old as civilization itself. This suggests we
might have a few things to learn from the senior industry. Richard
Gabriel seems to agree. In <span   class="emphasis"><em>Patterns of
Software</em></span> (Oxford Paperbacks, 1996) he extols the virtues
of building software for &ldquo;habitability&rdquo;. His structural ideal is
a New England farmhouse:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The result is rambling, but each part is well-suited to its
needs, each part fits well with the others....The inhabitants are
able to modify their environment because each part is built
according to the familiar patterns of design, use and construction
and because those patterns contain the seeds for piecemeal
growth.</p></blockquote></div><p>In <span   class="emphasis"><em>How Buildings Learn</em></span> (Penguin Books,
1994), Stewart Brand calls the New England farmhouse a perfect
example of &ldquo;vernacular&rdquo; construction. He writes:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>What gets passed from building to building via builders and
users is informal and casual and astute. At least it is when the
surrounding culture is coherent enough to embrace generations of
experience.</p><p>Vernacular is a term borrowed since the 1850s by
architectural historians from linguists, who used it to mean the
native language of a region....It means common in all three senses
of the word&mdash;widespread, ordinary and beneath notice.</p><p>In terms of architecture, vernacular buildings are seen as
the opposite of whatever is academic, high style, polite.
Vernacular is everything not designed by professional
architects&mdash;in other words, most of the world's
buildings....Vernacular building traditions have the attention span
to incorporate generational knowledge about long-term problems such
as maintaining and growing a building over time. High-style
architecture likes to solve old problems in new ways, which is a
formula for disaster....</p><p>Vernacular buildings evolve. As generations of new buildings
imitate the best of mature buildings, they increase in
sophistication while retaining simplicity.</p></blockquote></div><p>Is UNIX vernacular? Here's what Neal Stephenson says in his
book <span   class="emphasis"><em>In the Beginning Was the Command Line</em></span>
(Morrow, William &amp; Co., 1999):</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The filesystems of UNIX machines all have the same general
structure. On your flimsy operating systems, you can create
directories (folders) and give them names like Frodo or My Stuff
and put them pretty much anywhere you like. But under UNIX the
highest level&mdash;the root&mdash;of the filesystem is always designated
with the single character &ldquo;/&rdquo; and it always contains the same set
of top-level directories:</p><p>/usr/etc/var/bin/proc/boot/home/root/sbin/dev/lib/tmp</p><p>and each of these directories typically has its own distinct
structure of subdirectories. Note the obsessive use of
abbreviations and avoidance of capital letters; this is a system
invented by people to whom repetitive stress disorder is what black
lung is to miners. Long names get worn down to three-letter nubbins
like stones smoothed by a river.</p><p>It is this sort of acculturation that gives UNIX hackers
their confidence in the system, and the attitude of calm,
unshakable, annoying superiority. Windows95 and MacOS are products,
contrived by engineers in the service of specific companies. UNIX,
by contrast, is not so much a product as it is a painstakingly
compiled oral history of the hacker subculture.</p></blockquote></div><p>Vernacular architecture is the opposite of what Brand calls
&ldquo;Magazine Architecture&rdquo;, architecture as art, rather than as
craft. Here's the difference, according to Henry Glassie: &ldquo;If a
pleasure-giving function predominates, it is called art; if a
practical function predominates, it is called craft.&rdquo; It's hard to
imagine anything more crafty and practical than a command-line
interface.</p><p>Stewart Brand finds a lot of craft in what he calls &ldquo;Low
Road&rdquo; buildings, which tend to be &ldquo;low visibility, low-rent,
no-style&rdquo;. He says, &ldquo;Most of the world's work is done in Low Road
buildings...and even in rich societies the most inventive
creativity, especially youthful creativity, will be found in Low
Road buildings, taking full advantage of the license to try
things.&rdquo;</p><p>So, it's hardly a coincidence that Brand's ideal Low Road
building is MIT's Building 20, where &ldquo;The Tech Model Railroad Club
on the third floor, E Wing, was the source in the early 1960s of
most of the first generation of computer hackers who set in motion
a series of computer technology revolutions (still in
progress).&rdquo;</p><p>We tend to think of revolutions as rapid, but the revolution
that started in MIT's Building 20 predates Moore's Law, which was
first published in 1965. It also predates the software industry by
almost a generation. Any way you look at it, the hacker subculture
has served as a cultural foundation for computing for a very long
time. It has also persisted in a comparatively stable form while
commercial fashions and revolutions have come and gone, again and
again. I'm not saying UNIX does not have a commercial side; just
that its cultural foundations are deeper than commerce.</p><p>In <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Clock of the Long Now</em></span> (Basic
Books, 1999), Stewart Brand sorts civilization into six layers that
change at different rates over time.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4553f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Civilization's Six Layers
</p></div></div><p>From bottom to top they range from slow to fast. &ldquo;The fast
layers innovate&rdquo;, he says. &ldquo;The slow layers stabilize. The whole
combines learning with continuity.&rdquo;</p><p>This puts both hacker culture and software commerce into a
fresh and interesting perspective. Positioned one level above
nature, hacker culture is often concerned with the natural
qualities of software. The GNU Manifesto, for example, says free
software is &ldquo;just like air&rdquo;. Going up one level to governance, we
find the hacker culture's obsessive concern with license
agreements. These agreements manifest one layer up in
infrastructure: software and protocols (a form of both governance
and cultural agreement) that increases in value as it approaches
ubiquity.</p><p>I don't think it's a stretch to say that hacker culture has a
natural understanding of what makes software truly valuable. We see
manifest in the Internet, which possesses three almost natural
qualities: nobody owns it, everybody can use it and anybody can
improve it.</p><p>These are built into the Net&mdash;and into free software
development tools and licenses&mdash;for everybody and for fundamentally
social reasons. That's why the GNU Project says, &ldquo;people should be
free to use software in all the ways that are socially useful.&rdquo;
This is embodied not only in the GNU tools and other free software,
but in Linux, BIND, TCP/IP, sendmail, Apache, Jabber and SOAP&mdash;all
of which (for the most part) nobody owns, everybody can use and
anybody can improve.</p><p>These are values that do not&mdash;and cannot&mdash;come from business.
They are not commercial values. However, the layer of software
civilization we call commerce depends on the social infrastructure
that has grown up out of the hacker culture and UNIX in general.
This obviously includes the Net but also lots of other practical
and ubiquitous stuff that's free as air.</p><p>It is important to understand how these layers relate because
a lot of misunderstandings and bad decisions get made when, say,
commercial interests attempt to impose self-interested
infrastructure, or when governance attempts to socialize
commerce.</p><p>Michael Polanyi says &ldquo;comprehensive entities [such as
civilization] are logical combinations of levels of reality&rdquo;, and
there are principles&mdash;boundary conditions&mdash;by which each lower
level supplies conditions on which upper levels depend. Phil
Mullins puts it this way: &ldquo;A lower level imposes restrictions
within which a higher level can come to operate; the lower level
establishes boundaries but leaves open possibilities. The higher
level cannot be exhaustively described in terms of the lower
level...no level can gain control over its own boundary conditions
and hence cannot bring into existence a higher level.&rdquo; This is why
the Net didn't create e-commerce, yet e-commerce depends utterly on
the Net.</p><p>So, while the Free Software movement might appear
anticommercial to many in the purely commercial sector of the
software industry, in fact, it just isn't very interested in what
happens at the commercial level, and is even less interested in
what happens way up on the fashion level. There are more enduring,
more purely cultural, more natural concerns.</p><p>When we look at the boundary conditions that flank
infrastructure, we also see why software companies run into
problems when they try to civilize their industry from the top
down. Microsoft may have been successful at this but only
temporarily. These days all of us, including many at Microsoft, are
starting to feel software getting civilized from the bottom up,
thanks to the Net and the culture that built it.</p><p>We see progress today in protocols like SOAP and XML/RPC,
which were developed to support publishing on the Web (so, for
example, you can write simultaneously for multiple sites other than
your own). They're wide open and available to everybody. Dave Winer
and his company, Userland, were involved in both efforts. So were
Microsoft and Developmentor, a training and education company. When
I asked Dave how the efforts went, he said, &ldquo;Working with
Microsoft and Developmentor on both projects was the best
collaborative development experience I have ever had.&rdquo;</p><p>Microsoft comes from personal computing and always will. But
it has to thrive in a world where computing is more and more
social. And social computing has been built into UNIX since the
beginning.</p><p>For software businesses, Craig Burton says, &ldquo;the real
challenge is to create ubiquitous infrastructure while generating
shareholder value&rdquo;. It isn't easy, but it helps to do two things.
One is comply with your own engineers, who are busy making
infrastructure whether you like it or not. That's what IBM did when
it embraced Linux: a phenomenon that was growing like wildfire
inside its own enterprise. The other is to recognize what works
over the long term. The Long Now Foundation proposes seven
guidelines for a long-lived, long-valuable institution:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Serve the long view (and the long viewer).</p></li><li><p>Foster responsibility.</p></li><li><p>Reward patience.</p></li><li><p>Mind mythic depth.</p></li><li><p>Ally with competition.</p></li><li><p>Take no sides.</p></li><li><p>Leverage longevity.</p></li></ol></div><p>Institutions do learn&mdash;even the ones obsessed with art and
fashion. Take Apple. Perhaps the most significant item among
Apple's many rollouts early this year was the farthest from fashion
and, therefore, the least reported. It happened down at the level
of governance. After seventy thousand hackers jumped in to improve
Apple's BSD-derived Darwin OS, Apple responded by adjusting its
source code license in the direction of &ldquo;the nature of things&rdquo;.
The new license may not be a clone of the GPL but it's a whole lot
closer. Chris Bourdon, the Product Manager for OS X, told me, &ldquo;You
do take Darwin and do anything you like. It's there for
everybody.&rdquo;
</p><p>Of course it is. It's UNIX.</p></div></div>
