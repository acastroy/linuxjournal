folks, we're not playing favorites here; Loki is just so
forthcoming and has so many store-shelf titles out there right now
it's inevitable we're going to have a bit of a Loki deluge from
time to time. We do have some other great non-Loki titles in the
pipe and will be spending some time on Linux's noncommercial gaming
as well, we promise!</p><p>For now, I meant it when I said that this is a great game;
this game rocks. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent3</em></span> is the first
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent</em></span> version to make it to Linux, and it
looks like we're getting the best installment in the series so far.
Kudos to the fine folks at Outrage and Loki for getting the latest
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent</em></span> into our sweaty little hands. Some of
us still remember the awe we felt when we played the original
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent</em></span> for the first time, twisting through
subterranean mineshafts, floating weightlessly in space and the
dizzyingly true 3-D maneuvering possible from
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent</em></span>'s six-way motion control system. The
original <span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent</em></span>'s biggest issues were its
repetitive nature and simple plotlines. Even its successor,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent2</em></span>, saw little improvement on these
fronts, mainly adding support for new hardware, some improved game
play and some new weapons to enjoy. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent3</em></span>
finally gets it right; this game has both an interesting story and
unique levels with diverse, multiple goals, yet manages it all
without straying too much from the basic feel players have come to
expect from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent</em></span>-series games.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a0d580.0x1b05ea0"></a>The Story</h2></div></div><p>The story is not too complex, but it's entertaining and well
written (at last). The visually stunning introductory movie and the
first premission cut-scene movie are each five full minutes of
completely 3-D modeled plot development.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent3</em></span> essentially takes up right where its
predecessor left off: you're unconscious and adrift in space after
the explosion that rocked your world at the end of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent2</em></span>. At the last moment, as you and your
ship plunge helplessly to your doom into a solar corona, you're
rescued by some new friends. They reveal that your old employer,
the PTMC, has been doing some rather nasty stuff, such as
developing weird nanotech viruses designed to turn mining robots
into bloodthirsty military tools. Worse, they're apparently
responsible for sabotaging your ship and attempting to kill you!
(Okay, it isn't Herman Melville, but it's a good enough story to
keep you interested.) The rest of the game is basically about
flying around in your new spaceships (you eventually get three),
attempting to subvert the PTMC's plans, rescuing key detectors
involved in the virus project, exposing the PTMC's evilness to the
world and, more or less, opening up a proverbial can of Material
Defender-style whoop-ass on your ex-employer and would-be assassin.
The story line unfolds fluidly through the use of 3-D modeled
cut-scenes and radio transmissions. It is actually quite compelling
at times and has some unexpected twists. Though
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent3</em></span> is still a game that could be played
with no prior exposure to the plot, it is now good enough to be
engaging and fun to watch unfold.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4538f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a0d580.0x1b06268"></a>Game Play</h2></div></div><p>Combining the ease of movement in a first-person shooter with
the directional freedom of a spaceship is something
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent</em></span> has excelled at from the beginning.
The task is not without cost, however, and many players find that
keyboard-only control is extremely less effective than using a
joystick. There are three axes of motion and three directions of
travel to deal with, so coordinating the full use of all motion
controls while navigating and fighting unfriendly robots in tight
underground passageways is often a rough proposition.</p><p>The game itself is a series of missions, 15 in all, each with
its own unique objectives. Though the &ldquo;find keys to open doors to
get to goal&rdquo; motif is still present to at least some degree in
most levels, most have several challenging sub-goals to reach, as
well as occasional puzzles that must be solved in-game, some of
which can be quite challenging. Your enemy's artificial
intelligence is pretty high-quality stuff and is a major
improvement from past <span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent</em></span> versions. You'll
find that they attack in groups and use strategy (often falling
back when in danger to regroup), communicate with each other and
announce your presence to other robots in your general area (which
typically brings in the cavalry to cause you more headaches, some
of which will sneak around behind corners and lurk in waiting for
you to pass by, while others will get right in your face, or worse,
sneak up right behind you). Thankfully,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent3</em></span> comes with ten brand-new weapons for
you to use on these little twerps. Another of Outrage's triumphs,
their new &ldquo;Fusion&rdquo; rendering engine, allows another new facet to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent</em></span>'s levels: outdoor missions. No longer
are you continuously trapped in the claustrophobic depths of some
darkened mineshaft; now you can soar in the skies above the
extraterrestrial surface. The underground levels themselves are
well designed, varied in setting, often incredibly complex in
layout and generally look spectacular. All the levels are rather
gargantuan and complex; with only 15 total levels in the
single-player mode, each tends to consume a significant amount of
time and effort to complete. Luckily, in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent3</em></span>, you're not alone down
there....</p><p>Your little buddy from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent2</em></span> is back!
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent3</em></span> also gives its pilots the ability to
use a &ldquo;guidebot&rdquo;. Guidebots are small robots who accompany you
down in the tunnels, are carried by your ship and act as roving
robotic assistants. In times of need, you can launch your guidebot
and ask him to help you do any number of things, from leading the
way out of the seemingly endless maze of tunnels in order to help
you find your next goal (patiently waiting for you to follow it
along) to putting out fires or showing you the way to the next
enemy robot. Occasionally, the guidebot gets a bit confused or
forgets the next goal, and from time to time, he gets stuck in
weird places, but he is often an invaluable sidekick.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent3</em></span>'s audio/video quality is truly
inspired: the graphics are stunning; the environment can be
manipulated and destroyed; the special effects sounds are realistic
and crystal clear (and do much to provide the perfect level of
ambient noise in the tunnels) and even the background music sounds
not only good enough to leave turned on, but good enough to turn
up. My only issue with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent3</em></span>'s
OpenAL-accelerated sound is that it made me wish I had larger
speakers and more forgiving neighbors.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a0d580.0x1b06790"></a>Multiplayer</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent3</em></span>'s multiplayer support is, well,
phenomenal. You have nine types of multiplayer games to choose
from, ranging from the favorites like &ldquo;Capture the Flag&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Deathmatch&rdquo; (Anarchy mode) to the much less frequently seen (but
often missed) &ldquo;Cooperative&rdquo; mode. The &ldquo;Monster Ball&rdquo; mode is
kind of like a soccer game with spaceships. You can play in
TCP/IP-based mode for direct connections, or if you're looking for
a game, you can connect to Outrage's Parallax Online (PXO) gaming
network and join a game in progress. The descent3 binary can also
be run by itself as a standalone game server for the truly hardcore
who want to host their own dedicated <span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent3</em></span>
server.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4538f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a0d580.0x1b06b00"></a>Linux Notes</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent3</em></span>'s installation footprint can
get hefty (up to 1GB), but Loki's installer includes options for a
much smaller install, mainly done by leaving the movies on CD. The
game's hardware requirements are pretty low for the intensity of
game play offered. Loki recommends only a 300MHz CPU (and even
lists 200MHz as the bare minimum) and 64MB of RAM. One pitfall that
Loki doesn't mention is that if you leave the movies on CD, you
might want to consider a slightly faster CD-ROM than the 6x minimum
recommended by Loki; my older 8x drive was choking and coughing in
several of the more intense movie scenes. Software requirements
include the usual Loki list: Linux kernel 2.2.x and Glibc 2.1 and,
of course, for network play you'll need TCP/IP support and an
internet or LAN connection.</p><p>One item on <span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent3</em></span>'s minimum equipment
list is a 3-D accelerator card. Several card options are supported
and have been tested, including most of the more popular 3-Dfx
Voodoo series (by way of a nice dedicated Glide renderer), the
Matrox G200/G400-series cards (by way of Utah-GLX and Mesa drivers)
and NVIDIA cards supported by NVIDIA's OpenGL-endowed X server
(in-game testing, this reviewer's GeForce GTS worked flawlessly).
For a complete list of cards and drivers that have been tested with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent3</em></span>, it's probably best to check
<a href="http://www.lokigames.com" target="_self">http://www.lokigames.com/</a>
for the latest news.</p><p>Optional equipment for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent3</em></span> includes
the Rock'n Ride gaming chair available from
<a href="http://www.rocknride.com" target="_self">http://www.rocknride.com/</a>
(the coolness of which really defies description). Loki has even
been kind enough to include detailed instructions on how to use the
new <span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent3: Mercenary</em></span> expansion pack for
Windows with the Linux version of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent3</em></span>.
Very sweet.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a0d580.0x1afd808"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>Again, what can I say? This game is very entertaining, very
well written, very well executed and extremely fun to play. The
graphics are exceptional, the sound effects are clear and
high-quality&mdash;even the music is great. The basic movement controls
may be a bit complex but nothing that shouldn't be expected for the
amount of control you have over your ship. The general game
controls are simple, easy to operate and logically arranged. The
multiplayer action is second to none, and the 3-D support is
trouble-free. A truly excellent game; for the first-person shooter
genre, this is one of the coolest titles out there.</p><p><a href="4538s1.html" target="_self">The Good/The Bad</a></p><p><a href="4538s2.html" target="_self">Linux Game Update</a>
