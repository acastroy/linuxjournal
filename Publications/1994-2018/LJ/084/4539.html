    If your company isn't ready to dive head first into DSL or
    full-service Internet and e-mail service, a system like this might be a
    good solution.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1704580.0x17fc3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The company I work for is what could
euphemistically be called thrifty. We've got equipment dated from
the 1930s, and I worked there three months before I found out we
even had an internet account. (Pretty bad for the system
administrator, huh?) This was my first true IS job, and I was
willing to deal with the situation to get the experience. Come to
find out, the account was being hoarded in the engineering
department by the owner's son and his buddies.
</p><p>As time went on, our customers began requiring us to be more
in step with the times, accessing information on the Web, sending
and receiving e-mail, etc. I saw a number of other ways that adding
a Linux box to the network could help out the company and pay for
itself in no time. So I wrote a proposal and got permission to
procure a box to act as a file server, fax server, internal web
server, e-mail server and Internet gateway. Aside from the guys in
engineering, the rest of the plant had not even used e-mail, and
engineering had only used it once or twice. They thought the Web
was the only thing to do on the Internet. We won't talk about what
sites they were visiting.</p><p>The focus of this article is on the e-mail portion. I intend
to cover how to use sendmail, fetchmail and procmail to allow a
small company to effectively &ldquo;hide&rdquo; behind a single e-mail
address. Now, before you run out and do this, you might want to
consider how your ISP may feel about it. In our case, the volume of
e-mail is small, maybe 20 messages a day. Compared to my personal
account, which gets 100-400 a day, plus my business account, which
gets maybe 20-30, this is peanuts, and I don't think our ISP has
much to complain about. Your mileage may vary.</p><p>Did you ever notice how return addresses look when reading
e-mail? Most times, if the person has their full name set up in
their e-mail client configuration or if the administrator has it in
/etc/passwd, you will see something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Firstname Lastname &lt;somehandle@someisp.com&gt;
</pre><p>I was convinced that I could use this, somehow, to rewrite
the outgoing return address in such a way that, when the mail was
answered, I could pass it through a filter and on to the
appropriate person, while only consuming one e-mail address from
our ISP. I ending up buying O'Reilly's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>sendmail</em></span> book and doing a couple weeks of
experimenting, but I've now got a solution that has been in place
for about two and a half years and works pretty well. At an
additional $5 per e-mail address per month from our ISP, and about
15 users, I think it was worth the trouble.
</p><p>Here's the plan. The names are, of course, fictitious.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>thriftycompany@someisp.com&mdash;my company's e-mail
address from our ISP.</p></li><li><p>smtp.someisp.com&mdash;our ISP's SMTP server (outgoing
mail from us).</p></li><li><p>pop3.someisp.com&mdash;our ISP's POP3 server (incoming
mail to us).</p></li><li><p>linuxserver.thriftycompany.com&mdash;our file server
(thriftycompany.com is strictly internal, not a registered
domain).</p></li><li><p>mrpserver.thriftycompany.com&mdash;a Sun box, hosting
our MRP system. This is not a necessary part of the plan, but many
of my users spend all their time on an xterm to this box, so I
installed Pine on the Sun box for them. (Pine, in the GNU
tradition, stands for Pine Is Not Elm&mdash;another text-based e-mail
program. Pine is actually an extremely efficient mail client, and
my program of choice. It would take me days to wade through my
e-mail with a GUI.)</p></li><li><p>thriftycompany@linuxserver.thriftycomany.com&mdash;bogus
default e-mail address on the Linux box. All the incoming mail goes
through this address, and procmail passes it on to the
users.</p></li></ul></div><p>Through some /etc/sendmail.cf magic, and a procmail filter on
the incoming side, I can let several users use the same e-mail
account yet, for the most part, keep their mail private.
</p><p>Outgoing scenario: 1) User writes e-mail, either in Pine on
the Sun, or Outlook or Netscape's mail client. I only set up GUI
accounts for folks who need to deal with attachments. 2) If mail is
written on the PC, it is configured to pass the mail up to the Sun
box and retrieve mail from the same location. 3) If it's an
internal address, the Sun box delivers it. 4) If it's external, it
is passed to the Linux box. 5) Outgoing mail on the Linux box is
queued and sent out in batches twice an hour, after incoming mail
is pulled in. 6) At the proper time, /usr/sbin/sendmail -q -v is
run and, through the use of /etc/genericstable.db and some
masquerading rules in /etc/sendmail.cf, the user's return address
is rewritten as <b  >Firstname Lastname
&lt;thriftycompany@someisp.com&gt;</b></p><p>Incoming scenario: 1) Server makes connection to ISP at time
defined in cron. Or if already connected, leave the connection
alone. This is handled by <span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>diald</b></span>, but that's another article.
2) Incoming mail is retrieved using fetchmail and passed to the
default account, thriftycompany@linuxserver.thriftycompany.com. 3)
Procmail filter in thriftycompany's account looks for proper names
in the incoming addresses and passes the mail on to the users. Mail
that does not fit a filter rule falls in the default mailbox, and
as a precaution, a folder for each user is set up in this account's
mail/ directory. 4) All local mail, except root and thriftycompany,
gets forwarded to the Sun box. 5) User either receives mail in real
time in Pine on the Sun box, or interactively retrieves it from the
Sun box using GUI client. 6) All this sounds complicated, but it's
really not. Remember, the Sun box is just a convenience for my
situation and not necessary to the process. You could merely have
your users grab their mail from the Linux box.</p><p>Now for the files. Most, if not all, of what you need should
be in most Linux distributions already or somewhere on your CDs.
Just in case you need assistance, you will find URLs in our
Resources section.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1704580.0x17fce48"></a>Local Mail Handling</h2></div></div><p>Let's get the Sun/Linux mail passing out of the way first, so
if you don't need the second server, you can ignore it and move
on.</p><p>The Sun box's /etc/mail/sendmail.cf is standard. When I set
this up, I was still new to Solaris and hesitant to fool too much
with a system running our whole plant, so I did this to pass mail
out /etc/mail/sendmail.cf entry:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
DRmailhost
CRmailhost
</pre><p>/etc/hosts/entry:
<pre     class="programlisting">
192.9.200.2     linuxserver mailhost
</pre>


Before I made the change, /etc/hosts had the mailhost entry after
the Sun's IP address:
<pre     class="programlisting">
192.9.200.1 mrpserver mailhost
</pre>


This seemed to do the trick to get outgoing mail over to the Linux
box.
</p><p>On the Linux box, we want all local mail to go to the Sun
box, where the users' mail folders reside. None of my users, aside
from me, directly log in to the Linux box. They use files shared
through Samba. Telnet and FTP access is closed off:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
DHrelay:mrpserver.thriftycompany.com
</pre><p>The exceptions to this are root and the thriftycompany user,
whom I'd like to stay on this box:
<pre     class="programlisting">
CL root thriftycompany
</pre>


That about covers the interaction between the two local UNIX boxes.
Local mail stays on the Sun, internet mail gets passed to Linux and
then queued for the next connection. Incoming internet mail will
get re-addressed to local users and then relayed to the Sun box.
The root and thriftycompany accounts on the Linux box stay put, and
I check those as part of my daily routine.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1704580.0x17fd268"></a>Internet Mail, Outgoing</h2></div></div><p>Some of this setup was taken from various HOWTOs over the
years; other parts I gleaned from scouring Usenet and the O'Reilly
<span   class="emphasis"><em>sendmail</em></span> book.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>sendmail</b></span> startup: for a
demand dial scenario, we don't want sendmail initiating the
connection each time there is mail in the queue, so you need to
edit your sendmail startup line to hold off on &ldquo;expensive&rdquo;
mail:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
old entry: /usr/sbin/sendmail -bd -q15m
new entry: /usr/sbin/sendmail -bd -os
</pre><p>On a Red Hat-based system, this would be set up in
/etc/sysconfig/sendmail and/or /etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail.
</p><p>You'll be defining which mail is expensive within the
/etc/sendmail.cf file in Listing 1, as well as telling sendmail to
hold this type of mail.</p><p><a href="4539l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Defining and Holding
Expensive Mail</a></p><p>Notice the &ldquo;e&rdquo; in the &ldquo;F=&rdquo; portion for smtp, esmtp and
smtp8. This is the &ldquo;expensive&rdquo; flag, and we leave it off the
local relay. Also the Mlocal and Mprog should not have this flag so
that local system mail gets delivered immediately.</p><p>A cron job connects to the Internet twice an hour, and as
part of that job, we will send out all the queued mail once the
internet connection is in place:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/sbin/sendmail -q -v
</pre><p>Now to get the outgoing mail delivered and not rejected by
domains on the Internet. Since we do not have a valid domain name,
we need to do some work on the return address. We need to
masquerade the return address, as well as the envelope, and to get
any replies back to the original sender, we need to rewrite the
&ldquo;From:&rdquo; address.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1704580.0x17fd790"></a>Masquerading</h2></div></div><p>If you are building up your sendmail.cf from m4 sources, then
your local .mc file needs to contain the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
MASQUERADE_AS(someisp.com)
FEATURE(masquerade_envelope)
FEATURE(limited_masquerade)
FEATURE(genericstable)
</pre><p>We are using limited masquerading so only hosts defined in CM
get masquerade. If you are just editing /etc/sendmail.cf, then the
following lines need to be modified as shown:
<pre     class="programlisting">
<b  ># who I masquerade as</b> (null for no masquerading)
  (see also $=M)
DMsomeisp.com
</pre>


You will probably also want to relay the mail through your ISP so
that any downstream mail servers see the mail as coming from a
valid domain:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# "Smart" relay host (may be null)
DSsmtp:smtp.someisp.com
</pre>


Define the domain names that should be converted to the masqueraded
address:
<pre     class="programlisting">
CG mrpserver.thriftycompany.com
CM mrpserver.thriftycompany.com
</pre>


(If you've got just the one box, this would be
linuxserver.thriftycompany.com.)
</p><p>Now, the sendmail.cf lines to masquerade the contents and the
envelope get a bit messy. You would probably be better off building
a sendmail.cf from the m4 sources as shown in Listing 2.</p><p><a href="4539l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Building sendmail from M4
Sources</a></p><p>The final piece of the outgoing puzzle is to get the user's
return address rewritten. If I were to compose a message on the Sun
box, Pine would put together a return address that looks something
like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Stew Benedict &lt;stew@mrpserver.thriftycompany.com&gt;
</pre><p>Looks good enough, except that it is not a real address out
on the Internet, and I would never get a reply to my message. Plus,
most mail systems would reject it coming in as a nonexistent domain
address.
</p><p>What I want it to look like is this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Stew Benedict &lt;thriftycompany@someisp.com&gt;
</pre><p>This is where sendmail's &ldquo;genericstable&rdquo; feature will
finish up the job. Again, if you are building up your sendmail.cf
from m4 sources, the following line will do the trick:
<pre     class="programlisting">
FEATURE(genericstable)
</pre>


In the sendmail.cf file, if you are hand editing it:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# Generics table (mapping outgoing addresses)
Kgenerics hash -o /etc/genericstable
</pre>


(The -o means &ldquo;optional&rdquo;, so sendmail will not halt on startup
for lack of the file.) This addition to your local .mc file
generates the block shown in Listing 3 in sendmail.cf.
</p><p><a href="4539l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3.
sendmail.cf</a></p><p>The genericstable.db file is built up from a text file of the
following format:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
stew      thriftycompany@someisp.com
joe     thriftycompany@someisp.com
</pre><p>This file is then fed to the
<span   class="bold"><b>makemap</b></span> program to create the db
file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
makemap hash genericstable.db &lt; genericstable
</pre>


That does it for outgoing mail. Once you have finished
creating/modifying sendmail.cf and creating the genericstable.db
file, you will need to restart sendmail. On a Red Hat-based system,
this is done with:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail restart
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1704580.0x1bf6380"></a>Internet Mail, Incoming</h2></div></div><p>For incoming mail we use
<span   class="bold"><b>fetchmail</b></span> to fetch the mail from
the ISP. My cron job makes the internet connection and then runs a
line like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
su -c "/usr/bin/fetchmail -a -f /home/thiftycompany"

thriftycompany's .fetchmailrc:
poll pop3.someisp.com proto pop3 user thriftycompany

</pre><p>Procmail is defined as the local MDA (mail delivery agent) in
the sendmail.cf file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Mlocal,     P=/usr/bin/procmail, F=lsDFMAw5:/|@qShP,

            T=DNS/RFC822/X-Unix,
            A=procmail -a $h -d $u
</pre>


All the incoming mail goes to the thriftycompany account, where
there is a .procmailrc file set up to parse the incoming &ldquo;To:&rdquo;
lines and forward to the appropriate users, as seen in Listing 4.
</p><p><a href="4539l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. Forwarding E-Mail to the
Correct Users</a></p><p>You can also use this procmail filter to filter out
ILOVEYOU-type viruses, limit or quarantine attachments and other
useful things. Check out the procmail docs for more info on this.
Each user's mail is held in a folder under thriftycompany, in the
event of accidental erasures, etc. I periodically purge these
folders by hand.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1704580.0x1bf66f0"></a>Logging</h2></div></div><p>My boss has not quite bought into the usefulness of the
Internet and requests full tracking of its use. Part of my tracking
includes logging of all the incoming and outgoing mail
messages&mdash;quantity and size&mdash;per user. This is done through a shell
script run by cron every morning, as shown in Listing 5. The output
from this job looks like Listing 6.</p><p><a href="4539l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5. Tracking Incoming and
Outgoing Mail</a></p><p><a href="4539l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6. Output of Morning Cron
Track</a></p><p>That about does it. The tricky part is getting outside folks
to address the incoming mail properly. For most mail clients, this
just requires making a First Name, Last Name and e-mail address
entry in the address book, with the person's proper name and our
ISP e-mail address. For those people who have regular
correspondents who just can't seem to get it right, I add a
procmail rule with the &ldquo;From:&rdquo; address to make sure the mail gets
to its proper destination. The other suggestion I give users is to
send an e-mail to the other party and let them add the return
address from that to their address book.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1704580.0x1bf69b0"></a>Maintenance</h2></div></div><p>There is a certain amount of maintenance to this system on my
part, but it's minimal. In writing this article, I've considered
ways to automate these portions too; but for now, it's not really
much of a burden.</p><p>I check thriftycompany's mail daily to check for messages
that fell through the procmail filter. Not a big thing, I could
forward this mail to myself, and then I'd see it sooner, or I could
set up <span   class="bold"><b>KBiff</b></span> (KDE mail
notification utility) to watch this mailbox.</p><p>Also, I like to purge the individual mail folders under
thriftycompany's e-mail account. Again, not a big thing. I'm not
hurting for space on this server and our volume is small. There's
probably a Perl script out there that I could use to prune messages
&ldquo;n&rdquo; number of days old.</p><p>Currently, when I add a new user, I have to add a new entry
to the genericstable file, run makemap, restart sendmail and add an
entry to the procmail filter for thriftycompany. I've considered
making a shell script to accomplish these steps too, but currently
I add a user maybe four times a year.</p><p>I hope this article has given you some insight into setting
up an e-mail solution for a small company, one not quite ready to
make the leap into a full DSL or T1 connection with a domain name.
If you need to use the Internet and e-mail to communicate with your
customers and vendors, this should give you what you need to get
the job done.</p><p><a href="4539s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
