written completely in Java&rdquo;, and also &ldquo;Import and export QIF
files, search detailed transactions, reconcile checkbook balance
easily, print customized and standard reports and 3-D graphs, do
XML imports and exports&mdash;just load the enclosed CD&rdquo;.
</p><p>I have wanted to track my personal finances on Linux, and
thought this might be a good way to do it. I had tried GnuCash [see
page 122 for details about this alternative] but found it not
feature-rich enough for my tastes. This CD, which says it runs &ldquo;on
virtually any operating system from Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS X or
OS/2, Sun Solaris, MacOS and Windows&rdquo;, sounded good. I popped it
in the CD-ROM drive to give it a whirl.</p><p>The CD label clearly states &ldquo;Prerelease version, not for
sale&rdquo;. I'm not sure how prerelease this is, but I anticipate this
will be very similar to the release version. The screen shows,
&ldquo;Moneydance 3.0-BETA (153)&rdquo;.</p><p>Hmm. The CD root directory has several files that appear to
be installers: install.bin, install.exe and install.sh, as well as
Setup.kdelnk files. The Setup.kdelnk file looked promising, but I
had a hard time clicking on it&mdash;no icon. Once I got it working, I
was greeted with a text window with this message:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Mon Jan 22 15:21:47 PST 2001
Welcome to Moneydance install press return to continue
</pre><p>I pressed the Enter key.
<pre     class="programlisting">

Where would you like to install Moneydance?
(We recommend /opt/moneydance)
</pre>


Ahh, this looked like a good spot to install. I pressed Enter
again.
<pre     class="programlisting">
Where would you like to install Moneydance?
(We recommend /opt/moneydance)
</pre>


Okay, I have to type it out. Fine,
<b  >/opt/moneydance</b>.
</p><p>And the text window disappeared. I had expected something
like, &ldquo;Installing Moneydance, please wait&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Install
completed, press Enter&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Install failed, you don't have
enough permissions&rdquo; or something. I got nothing.</p><p>Looking through Setup.kdelnk, I saw that it called the
install.sh I had found on the CD but failed to call it with root
permissions. Note to Appgen: adding X-KDE-SubstituteUID=true and
X-KDE-Username=root will tell KDE2 to prompt for the root password
and su before calling the script. Barring that, please add an error
handler with a pause at the end so we can see the error messages
the script creates.</p><p>So the install procedure becomes: pull up our xterm,
<b  >su</b> to root, and enter
<b  >/mnt/cdrom/install.sh.</b> Now Moneydance installed
fine. Running it from a command prompt, I am shown:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

on-line banking will not work.
</pre><p>On-line banking would have been cool. Oh, well. Next I am
asked for my currency and am offered a choice of US, Australian or
Canadian dollar; Brazilian Real; German Mark; Danish Krone; Euro;
French Franc; British Pound; Italian Lira or Japanese Yen. The
documentation sheet I was given adds that &ldquo;Moneydance has been
translated into French, German, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese&rdquo;.
This is certainly an international program.
</p><p>The main window popped up (see Figure 1). It's pretty
unencumbered. The current date and time, along with the current
month's calendar, are at the top of the screen, and next come
summaries of my accounts (none yet) with a big goose egg for my
personal worth.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4555f1.large.jpg"><img src="4555f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. The Moneydance Main
Screen</p></div></div>
</p><p>At the bottom of the screen are currency exchange rates for
the 11 currencies Moneydance supports. I found a button that
refreshes these from data on the Internet. The heading told me it
would list stock prices too, if I had any. Now to find out how to
add them.</p><p>Time to create some accounts. The account menu (see Figure 2)
lets me choose a bank, credit card, investment, asset, liability,
loan, expense or income account. I chose bank and clicked on Next.
I was prompted for an account name, bank name, account and routing
numbers, an initial balance and currency type.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4555f2.large.jpg"><img src="4555f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. The Account Detail Screen</p></div></div>
</p><p>Should I give this account a default category? The only
category I had was listed with a diamond and labeled Expense. Sure,
why not. Should this account be a child of another account? It gave
&ldquo;Root Account&rdquo; as my only option. Okay. The last option was
labeled &ldquo;Check# items&rdquo; and showed:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CkCrd
Dep
Trn
ATM
{Print}
&lt;Next Check#&gt;
</pre><p>I wasn't sure what the significance of this was. I could add
new entries, shuffle the order of entries and delete entries from
this list. I chose not to do any of these.
</p><p>Back on the main screen (the &ldquo;Home Page&rdquo;, it tells me) I
have a checking account with $0 in it. Clicking on it brings me to
a detailed transaction window that lets me enter new transactions,
reconcile my account, print checks, and set up on-line banking and
bill payment (neither of which work yet). I can get graphs of my
transactions also, but first I have to enter some.</p><p>Let's see...if I start with $100, I can pay myself $50, give
$25 to <i  >Linux Journal</i> and still have $25 left
over. Can I get a graph now? Yes, of Expenses, Income, Income and
Expenses or Account Balance, grouped by Day, Week, Month or Year. I
clicked &ldquo;Account Balance&rdquo;, &ldquo;Group By Day&rdquo; and &ldquo;Done&rdquo;.
Nothing. Try again&mdash;&ldquo;Graph&rdquo;, &ldquo;Account Balance&rdquo;, &ldquo;Group By
Day&rdquo;...aha, the Done button is mislabeled. It should read &ldquo;Cancel
this action, I really didn't want to use all of the data I had
entered&rdquo;. The &ldquo;Generate Graph&rdquo; button means &ldquo;show me the
graph&rdquo;.</p><p>The graph is a very pretty but a slightly unsettling &ldquo;V&rdquo; in
a large window. While the V was very nice, and told me
<b  >Account Balance: checking ??details??</b> whenever I
hovered the mouse pointer over it, the high balance of $150 (after
a few more transactions) was at the extreme top of the screen, and
the low balance of $111.98 was at the extreme bottom. In vain I
tried to find a way to adjust the scale so that I could avoid
making it look like I was dead broke with $111.98 in the bank. I
settled with knowing that a dip of the graph to the very bottom of
the screen doesn't mean I'm broke. Phew.</p><p>I could print or save this graph and toggle 3-D mode on and
off. The print command appears to print standard PostScript to a
printer (such as lp) in portrait or landscape mode with letter,
legal, executive or A4 formats. Hmm, printing from Moneydance
doesn't work to my remote LPRng printer. Ick.</p><p>I went back to the main window&mdash;er, &ldquo;Home Page&rdquo;&mdash;and
checked the overview. I now had a bank account with $111.98! After
reloading the exchange rates (they didn't change; it must not be
real time) I decided to add a stock account.
Account&mdash;&gt;New&mdash;&gt;Investment&mdash;&gt;Next. To create an investment
account, it wants the bank name and account number. Was this right?
I wanted to track stocks, not a bank account. Cancel. Perhaps
Account&mdash;&gt;New&mdash;&gt;Asset&mdash;&gt;Next. Nope, that's not right. I
guess investment was it.</p><p>Creating an investment account and clicking on it, showed me
tabs labeled &ldquo;Portfolio View&rdquo;, &ldquo;Register&rdquo; and &ldquo;Securities
Detail&rdquo;. This was what I wanted. On the right side of the window
was an &ldquo;Add Security&rdquo; button. Enter the name, the symbol, the
type (CD, Bond, Mutual or Stock), the price, the broker, the phone
number and comments. I decided to track MSFT and RHAT.</p><p>In the securities detail screen I could buy, sell, track
splits and show a history of the stock. I could download data
points from Yahoo or add and remove them myself. Downloading from
Yahoo, I saw that over the past few months RHAT has closed between
5 and 9.2. Performance was shown on a three-month scale with no
option to adjust; the data points were no more granular than one
every day or two. Good thing I'm not a day trader.</p><p>I told Moneydance that I had bought 100 shares of MSFT for
$50 and sold them the same day for $70. Not a bad profit. It didn't
even ask me which account I used to pay for them. They closed at
$61, so after a few transactions I was a few thousand dollars
richer. Wow, if only I could do that in real life.</p><p>The news button didn't show me anything; it would have been
nice, but I really just wanted to create virtual wealth anyway.
Back at the home page, I asked for another update on exchange rates
and stock prices. Hmm, stock prices don't show up in the Stock
Prices section. Clicking on MSFT again I notice it's gone down to
$60.125. Moneydance's data points aren't granular enough to be good
for making investment decisions; it's really just for tracking how
well you did in the aftermath.</p><p>I now had a virtual net worth of $4500, due to some creative
data entry and a good look at Moneydance. The only other option
that interested me was the Budget Manager from the Tools menu. I
could choose any expense account (for some reason, I now had three
expense accounts, all labeled with a single diamond) and Moneydance
would create a budget based on past transactions. While that is a
handy feature, I couldn't find a way to edit the budget&mdash;I could
only accept what it presented me with, and I couldn't create new
budget categories&mdash;and the only time it was used was in one report,
the Budget report.</p><p>What I really wanted was a way to assign transactions from my
checking account to different categories and have the computer tell
me how close I was getting to my monthly allotment of funds. Not
so. Appgen, consider this a feature request for the next version
please.</p><p>My thoughts: Moneydance isn't a bad product. It's got a few
glitches but nothing major. It's stable and works well for what
it's meant to do. I like it better than GnuCash, but GnuCash is
free, and Moneydance isn't. Would I buy Moneydance? Not without a
budget tracker.</p><p><a href="4555s1.html" target="_self">The Good/The Bad</a></p></div></div>
