    How to harden your system.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2792580.0x288a4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Are you one of the many people who, when
running <b  >ps -ef</b> for the first time after
installing Linux, has no idea what half of those processes are?
Don't be embarrassed; we all have to start somewhere, and it takes
time (and a lot of man-page lookups) to understand the myriad of
applications and d&aelig;mons it takes to make a UNIX system run.
While there's no substitute for doing those man-page lookups and
truly understanding our systems, we shouldn't punish ourselves by
running insecure systems until we've achieved guru status.
</p><p>Bastille Linux, a powerful set of system-hardening Perl
scripts, secures Linux systems and educates their administrators:
when run in interactive mode it asks clear, specific questions that
allow it to create a custom security configuration for your system.
It also explains each question in detail so that by the time you've
finished a Bastille session, you've learned quite a bit about
Linux/UNIX security.</p><p>If you already understand system security and are only
interested in using Bastille to save time, you can run Bastille in
its &ldquo;explain less&rdquo; mode that asks all the same questions but
skips the explanations. If you're running Bastille on a &ldquo;clean&rdquo;
Linux installation, you can even skip the questions altogether and
choose one of several &ldquo;secure by default&rdquo; security templates
depending on what type of system you want. And if you're a real
cowboy/girl, you can write your own Bastille configuration template
from scratch (or, more likely, by tweaking one of the provided
templates to fit your needs).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2792580.0x288a6b8"></a>Do We Really Need Bastille? Yes!</h2></div></div><p>You may be thinking &ldquo;Why does so much stuff have to be
running and enabled by default? Isn't it silly to use special
scripts just to trim the fat, when we could simply leave out all
that fat in the first place?&rdquo;</p><p>In my opinion most distributions of Linux do have too many
things enabled by default. But the fact is that ever-increasing
numbers of Linux users are absolute beginners, and if the first
time they install and reboot their Linux system, it doesn't do very
much (or worse still, doesn't work at all), then fewer people will
stick with Linux and learn to run it securely.</p><p>In other words, Linux packagers (the people who create
distributions such as Red Hat, Caldera, etc.) usually prefer to err
on the side of usability rather than on security. Personally I wish
more distributions offered both maximum functionality and
&ldquo;paranoid&rdquo; configuration options in their installers. (Note that
Red Hat 7.0's installer does in fact offer such options, although
their &ldquo;paranoid&rdquo; option isn't necessarily as secure as a
post-Bastille configuration.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2792580.0x288a870"></a>How Bastille Came to Be</h2></div></div><p>The original goal of the Bastille team (led by Jon Lasser and
Jay Beale) was to create a new secure Linux distribution based on
Red Hat. The quickest way to get their project off the ground
seemed to be to start with a normal Red Hat installation and then
to &ldquo;bastillify&rdquo; it (my term) with Perl scripts.</p><p>Before long, the team had decided that a set of hardening
scripts that could be used on different distributions would be less
redundant and more flexible than an entirely new distribution.
Rather than moving away from the script approach altogether, the
Bastille team has instead evolved the scripts themselves.</p><p>The Perl scripts that comprise Bastille Linux are quite
intelligent and make fewer assumptions about your system than they
did in the days when Bastille was meant only to be used on fresh
installations of Red Hat. Your system need not necessarily be
either a &ldquo;clean install&rdquo; or even Red Hat for Bastille to work,
thanks to new functionality in version 1.1.x that transparently
gleans a good deal of information about your system before making
changes to it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2792580.0x288aa28"></a>Obtaining and Installing Bastille</h2></div></div><p>Okay, you're psyched and ready for automated, educational
system-hardening. One little warning before we proceed: your
mileage may vary. Although Bastille can be used on most Linux
distributions, it started out as strictly a Red Hat utility and is
still optimized for Red Hat and Red Hat-derived distributions. I'll
offer some tips on using Bastille on non-Red Hat-derived
distributions, but I can't guarantee your results. When in doubt,
refer to Bastille's web page (see Resources).</p><p>Speaking of which, that's the home and definitive source of
both Bastille Linux and its documentation. A link to the latest
version of Bastille Linux can always be found in big bold letters
near the top of the home page at
<a href="http://www.bastille-linux.org" target="_self">http://www.bastille-linux.org/</a>.
Once you've downloaded the tarball, move it to /root and unpack
it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf ./Bastille-X.Y.Z.tgz
</pre><p>That's it, it's installed!
</p><p>Note that Bastille expects to live in /root. You can probably
hack the Bastille scripts to reflect some other home, but I don't
recommend it as this is an unsupported action (and affects a lot of
scripts). This shouldn't bother you; we usually don't get to choose
where RPMs and other software packages get installed either.</p><p>Also, you need to have the Perl 5 scripting language
installed in order to run Bastille Linux. To check your system for
Perl (and its version) simply enter the command <b  >perl
-v</b>. If Perl replies with a version number less than 5.0,
or if your system replies with <b  >perl: command not
found</b> then you need to upgrade or install Perl. No
current Linux distribution lacks a Perl 5 package; refer to your
Linux CD-ROMs or your distribution's home page to obtain a binary
package for your system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2792580.0x288adf0"></a>Getting Started with Bastille</h2></div></div><p>Using Bastille is easy. From /root/Bastille, you run the
script <span   class="bold"><b>InteractiveBastille.pl</b></span> (see
Figure 1), which asks you a long list of questions about what you
need enabled and how you need it configured for a balance of
functionality and security appropriate for your particular needs.
These questions are split into different sections: IPChains,
PatchDownload, FilePermissions, etc. The results of this Q&amp;A
session are stored in a file called config.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4547f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. InteractiveBastille.pl
</p></div></div><p>Next, run the script
<span   class="bold"><b>BackEnd.pl</b></span>, which invokes the
scripts corresponding to each section in InteractiveBastille.pl,
using config to define the numerous variables that determine how
these scripts behave. Depending on how you answered Bastille's
questions, some of the component scripts may not be invoked at all
(e.g., if you answered &ldquo;no&rdquo; to &ldquo;Configure IPChains?&rdquo;).</p><p>If you don't want to bother with all those questions, you can
instead run <span   class="bold"><b>AutomatedBastille.pl</b></span>,
which will give you the choice of several default security
baselines and will then immediately harden your system accordingly.
AutomatedBastille.pl is an extremely simple script; really, it's
just a mechanism for invoking BackEnd.pl with a canned
configuration file.</p><p>The included baselines (Default_Workstation and
Default_Workstation_plus_Firewall in Bastille v.1.1.0) can easily
be adapted for your own particular needs; thus, it's a simple
matter to create your own baselines and add them to
AutomatedBastille.pl if you have large numbers of systems to
harden. Alternatively, you can skip AutomatedBastille.pl altogether
and simply run BackEnd.pl with the configuration file of your
choice, for example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
./Backend.pl <b  >./myconfig</b> /root/bastille-output-log
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2792580.0x288b370"></a>Some Notes on InteractiveBastille.pl</h2></div></div><p>InteractiveBastille.pl explains itself extremely well during
the course of a Bastille session. If you take the time to read this
script's explanations of its own questions, you'll learn a lot
about system-hardening. If you already know a lot, you can select
the explain less option at any point to make the questions a bit
less wordy (and if you change your mind, you can choose &ldquo;explain
more&rdquo; later).</p><p>Bastille's verbosity notwithstanding, the following general
observations on certain sections may prove useful to the
beginner:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Module 1: IPChains.pm&mdash;IPChains is Linux's firewall
system. If your host is going to be accessible by hosts on the
Internet, I strongly recommend that you configure IPChains. Even a
few simple packet-filtering rules will greatly enhance overall
system security.</p></li><li><p>Module 2: PatchDownload.pm&mdash;if you have a Red Hat
system, Bastille can download and install RPMs of any software that
has changed since you originally installed it.</p></li><li><p>Module 3: FilePermissions.pm&mdash;this module restricts
access to certain utilities and files, mainly by disabling their
SUID status. Generally speaking, SUID is used to allow a process to
behave as though it had been invoked by root, allowing nonroot
users to use utilities such as
<span   class="bold"><b>mount</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>ping</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>traceroute</b></span>. However, these
utilities are usually not needed by unprivileged users and can in
fact be used for all sorts of mischief. Disabling SUID status makes
such commands usable only by root.</p></li><li><p>Module 4: AccountSecurity.pm&mdash;this module allows
you to create a new administration account and generally tighten up
the security of user-account management. These are all excellent
steps to take; I recommend using them all.</p></li><li><p>Module 5: BootSecurity.pm&mdash;if it's possible for
unknown or untrusted persons to sit in front of your system, reboot
or power-cycle it and interrupt the boot process; these settings
can make it harder for them to compromise the system.</p></li><li><p>Module 6: SecureInetd.pm&mdash;in this section, internet
services are tightened down and warning banners created.</p></li><li><p>Module 7: DisableUserTools.pm&mdash;disabling the
compiler is a good idea if the system's nonroot users don't
explicitly need to use it. As in most other cases, when Bastille
says &ldquo;disable&rdquo; here it actually means &ldquo;restrict to root-access
only&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p>Module 8: ConfigureMiscPAM.pm&mdash;several useful
restrictions on user accounts are set here.</p></li><li><p>Module 9: Logging.pm&mdash;too little logging is enabled
by default on most systems. This module increases logging and
allows you to send log data to a remote host. Process accounting
(i.e., tracking all processes) can also be enabled here but is
overkill for most systems.</p></li><li><p>Module 10: MiscellaneousDaemons.pm&mdash;in this section
you can disable a number of services that tend to be enabled by
default despite being unnecessary for most users.</p></li><li><p>Module 11: Sendmail.pm&mdash;self-explanatory.</p></li><li><p>Module 12: RemoteAccess.pm&mdash;if you don't have it
yet, Bastille can download and install the Secure Shell for you!
SSH is a secure replacement for
<span   class="bold"><b>Telnet</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>rsh</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>rlogin</b></span>. Note that Bastille will
attempt to install RPMs compiled for Red Hat systems on i386
architectures. If you run Linux on a non-PC-compatible architecture
or use a distribution that chokes on Red Hat RPMs (e.g., Debian),
then this module won't work for you.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2792580.0x2c841c8"></a>Logs and Running Bastille on Non-Red Hat
Distributions</h2></div></div><p>So, after InteractiveBastille.pl creates config and
BackEnd.pl implements it, what then? How do I know what happened?
Thanks to Bastille's excellent logging, it's easy to determine
exactly which changes were successful and, equally important, which
failed, and that makes this a good place to discuss running
Bastille on non-Red Hat distributions.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, while Bastille is optimized for Red
Hat and Red Hat-derived Linux distributions (e.g., Mandrake, Yellow
Dog, etc.), it is intelligent enough to work on others as well. And
in fact, my own experience bears this out: I ran Bastille 1.1.0 on
a system running SuSE Linux 6.3, and I'm pleased to report that far
more of Bastille worked than not.</p><p>The first thing I noticed during my SuSE-6.3 Bastille session
was that several actions are explicitly Red Hat-centric
(InteractiveBastille.pl gives warning to that effect). Module 2,
PatchDownload.pm, is strictly for Red Hat systems. And as noted
above, Module 12, RemoteAccess.pm, installs the Red Hat i386
version of Secure Shell 1.2.27.</p><p>One other question in my session, regarding whether I should
run <span   class="bold"><b>named</b></span> in a chroot jail [see
&ldquo;Paranoid Penguin: Securing DNS and Bind&rdquo;,
<i  >LJ</i> October 2000] came with the same warning.
Luckily, both downloading patches and configuring named to run
chrooted are things one can do manually without too much
trouble.</p><p>Although these were the only explicitly Red Hat parts that
Bastille warned me about during the InteractiveBastille.pl session,
there were other parts of Bastille that didn't deal with SuSE too
well. BackEnd.pl returned no errors (to the console) at all; I
wasn't aware that anything had failed until I read Bastille's
logs.</p><p>Note that it's probably a good idea to review these logs
regardless of whether you think something's gone wrong; meaningful
logging is one of Bastille's better features. And whether a
beginner or a security guru, you should know not only what changes
Bastille makes, but how it makes them.</p><p>Logically enough, Bastille writes its logs into
/root/Bastille/log/. Two logs are created by BackEnd.pl: action-log
and error-log. action-log provides a comprehensive and detailed
accounting of all of Bastille's activities. Errors and other
unexpected events are logged to error-log.</p><p>Most of the errors in my SuSE Bastille session involved files
not residing where Bastille expected them. In a few cases this was
due to SuSE keeping them in different places than Red Hat does; for
example, Red Hat puts Apache (web server) configuration files in
/etc/httpd/conf, whereas SuSe puts them in /etc/httpd. Bastille
therefore failed to make any changes to Apache on my SuSE
system.</p><p>In this example and most other file-location errors, it was
fairly easy to figure out how to make the changes manually;
Bastille's list of questions, /root/Bastille/Questions.txt,
provides plenty of hints (easily found via
<span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span>), and if you understand Perl
you can parse the scripts in /root/Bastille/Bastille to determine
precisely what Bastille was trying to do.</p><p>The easiest thing to do, however, is simply to change the
paths in the Bastille scripts and then rerun BackEnd.pl. Many of
the paths that I needed to change for SuSE were in
/root/Bastille/Bastille/FilePermissions.pl. For each file
identified by error-log as missing, I simply checked for it using
<span   class="bold"><b>which</b></span>. If it did indeed exist but
in an unexpected location, I edited
/root/Bastille/Bastille/FilePermissions.pl accordingly.</p><p>In the example below (an excerpt of the real error-log on my
SuSE system) we see that Bastille couldn't find, setserial,
chkconfig or ifdown:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#ERROR: chmod: File /bin/setserial doesn't exist!
#ERROR: chmod: File /sbin/chkconfig doesn't exist!
#ERROR: chmod: File /sbin/ifdown doesn't exist!
</pre><p>I happen to know that chkconfig and ifdown don't exist on
SuSE systems; they're unique to Red Hat and its derivatives.
Therefore those particular &ldquo;errors&rdquo; were moot. What about
setserial? Entering the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
which setserial
</pre>


returned the output:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/setserial
</pre>


Then, entering the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
grep setserial /root/Bastille/Bastille/*
</pre>


returned the output:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/root/Bastille/Bastille/FilePermissions.pm:  &amp;B_chmod(0750,"/bin/setserial");
</pre>


The which command told me where setserial lives on my system; the
grep command told me which Bastille module and even which line I
had to edit to fix setserial's path.
</p><p>For a relatively small number of nonexistent files this was
no big deal; for each file I determined whether it existed on my
system and if so, where. I then verified that FilePermissions.pm
was the offending module and edited it accordingly. Doing this for
all the files cited in error-log and then rerunning BackEnd.pl took
less than 20 minutes.</p><p>There was one other problem that needed fixing, and it's
illustrated in the following example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#open /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.bastille failed...
#open /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf failed.
Couldn't replace line(s) in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
#open /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.bastille failed...
#open /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf failed.
Couldn't replace line(s) in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf because open failed.
</pre><p>As you can see, this was caused by the aforementioned
difference between Red Hat's and SuSE's Apache environments. Again
I used my handy grep command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
grep httpd.conf /root/Bastille/Bastille/*.pm
</pre>


This returned several lines:
<pre     class="programlisting">
API.pm:  $GLOBAL_FILE{"httpd.conf"}=

API.pm:  $GLOBAL_FILE{"httpd_access.conf"}=

API.orig.pm:   $GLOBAL_FILE{"httpd_access.conf"}=

Apache.pm:  my $httpd_file=$GLOBAL_FILE{"httpd.conf"};
</pre>


This told me that Bastille's Apache module references a variable
called GOLBAL_FILE to store httpd.conf's path, and this variable is
set in API.pm. Changing this path in API.pm and again rerunning
BackEnd.pl (with everything commented out except the line invoking
Apache.pm) was a trivial matter.
</p><p>This may seem like a lot of tinkering for the sake of
paranoia. But, even if Bastille succeeds in completing only 80% of
its tasks on a non-Red Hat system, that system is still
significantly more secure than it was before, right?
Absolutely.</p><p>But Murphy's Law tells us that one of those utilities whose
permissions Bastille couldn't tighten down could very well be the
one that a mischievous user exploits to grant himself or herself
root access. Taking the time to identify and correct these Bastille
&ldquo;hiccoughs&rdquo; pays off, especially if you've got more than one
system to harden. Obviously, the more systems of a given type that
need hardening, the bigger the return on your time investment in
customizing Bastille for that type.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2792580.0x2c84c70"></a>Hooray, I'm Completely Secure Now! Or Am
I?</h2></div></div><p>Okay, we've carefully read and answered the questions in
InteractiveBastille.pl; we've run BackEnd.pl; we've checked
Bastille's work by going over its logs, and we've gone back and
rerun BackEnd.pl after tweaking a module or two. Are we there
yet?</p><p>No, nor will we ever be! Security is a process, not a
product. The surest way to create a vulnerable system is to plug it
in, turn it on and forget about it, even if at some point prior to
forgetting about it you hardened it.</p><p>Oops, I'm preaching&mdash;force of habit (I do this stuff for a
living). Well, even in the immediate task of hardening our system,
after running Bastille we've still got a few tasks left before
taking a breather.</p><p>Remember back at the beginning of the article when I started
preaching about the big trade-off that comes with functionality?
One of the many ramifications of this is that even Bastille can
only do so much; it's impossible to anticipate and create Bastille
modules for every software package that might be installed in any
given Linux distribution.</p><p>Some distributions, Debian and SuSE in particular, include an
enormous number of packages&mdash;so many that in a recent Slashdot
interview Bastille's Jon Lasser (see Resources) referred to them as
being especially problematic as a result, from a security
standpoint. He hastened to point out that this doesn't mean that
systems with a lot of different software packages can't be secured;
it simply means that it takes more work.</p><p>Therefore, be sure to do the following after running
Bastille:</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Disable Any Remaining Unnecessary
Services:</b></span> Check which services still have startup
scripts in /etc/rc.d/rcX.d, where X is your default runlevel. (You
can find your default runlevel with the command <b  >grep
initdefault /etc/inittab</b>.)</p><p>Startup scripts begin with a capital S. If you don't know
what &ldquo;Ssomedaemon&rdquo; does, try <b  >man</b> somedaemon.
If you don't need it, then <b  >mv S</b>somedaemon
dis_S<b  >somedaemon</b> (if it doesn't begin with S, the
script won't be run at startup).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Take the Time to Learn and Secure Your
Applications:</b></span> Bastille makes it possible to secure a
system before knowing very much about system security&mdash;that's why
its creators have spent so much time adding educational content to
it. But both the applications it secures and especially the ones it
doesn't won't remain secure unless you invest the time needed to
understand them.</p><p>BIND, for example, which provides DNS (name) resolution to
network applications, has a variety of security features. Bastille
configures some of them (on Red Hat and Mandrake, that is) but only
scratches the surface. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bind Operators'
Guide</em></span> and the named man page are required reading for
any system administration who runs BIND, period. Put another way:
RTFM!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Disable Any Remaining Unused User
Accounts:</b></span> One of SuSE's more annoying quirks is the
inclusion of a long list of entries in /etc/passwd for
application-specific user accounts regardless of whether those
applications are even installed. While very few of these are
privileged accounts, many can be used for interactive login (i.e.,
they specify a shell rather than /bin/false).</p><p>This is hardly unique to SuSE. Therefore, be sure to check
/etc/passwd and comment out any unnecessary entries. If in doubt,
change the final field (default shell) from a real shell to
/bin/false&mdash;only actual user accounts need shells!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Maintain Your System
Software:</b></span> I've said it at least twice already, but
there's no substitute for keeping current. Keep abreast of your
distribution's security patches and bulletins! And as you learn
more about Linux security, make sure you apply that knowledge to
the stuff you installed back when you were a newbie. Do not hook
your machine up to the Internet, power it up and forget about
it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Install an IDS:</b></span> As soon as
possible after installing the operating system, install Intrusion
Detection software like <span   class="bold"><b>tripwire</b></span>
or <span   class="bold"><b>snort</b></span>. It's the simplest thing
you can do to minimize your chances of finding out from the wrong
people (FBI, angry system administrators, etc.) that your system
has been hacked and used to attack others. See Bobby S. Wen's
article &ldquo;Open-Source Intrusion Detection Tools for Linux&rdquo;
(<i  >LJ</i> October 2000).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Monitor Your Logs:</b></span> The last
system-hardening tidbit I'll leave you with this month is the
necessity of reading the logs you told Bastille to enhance. These
logs are no good to you at all if you never open them.</p><p>Parsing log files can be tedious work though, so it's a good
idea to either write scripts that periodically check the logs for
suspicious activity, or install a tool like
<span   class="bold"><b>swatch</b></span>, which does for log
monitoring what Bastille does for system tightening. In fact, it's
worth its own Paranoid Penguin column....</p><p><a href="4547s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
