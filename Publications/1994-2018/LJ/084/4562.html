    Now you can watch cable TV on an X desktop.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdb9580.0xeb16b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month we installed Debian Linux
2.2.r2 (aka potato) and configured LILO to boot Linux, Win2K,
WinNT, Win98SE and Win98. Building a Linux desktop machine is a
two-step process. The second part, installing XFree86 for a
graphical desktop, is our first task this month. Once we have the X
Windows System working properly we will patch kernel 2.2.17 to
install Video4Linux and use XawTV to watch cable television on our
X desktop. As a newbie to Linux I will encounter many obstacles
doing all this.
</p><p>By default Linux boots in console mode. Like the old Windows
3.1, a Linux box first boots as a text console then loads the GUI.
If you are building a Linux server, the console may be all you need
or want. A GUI can create a lot of unnecessary overhead and more
can go wrong. However, we are building a desktop. We will install
the X Windows System, the Blackbox window manager, Netscape and
other graphical applications such as The GIMP.</p><p>The Debian package management tool is called
<span   class="bold"><b>dselect</b></span>. This software will
install applications included in our six Debian CDs and can also
retrieve packages across the Internet. There are about 4,000
packages to choose from on the Debian CDs. Linux applications don't
come enclosed in a nice graphical install program the way Windows
programs typically do.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4562f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
deselect
</p></div></div><p>The console-based dselect interface was slick in its day but
is showing obvious age. It isn't very acceptable by modern
interface standards, and with so many packages it is difficult to
navigate. You may be offered the option to make dselect operate via
a web browser. Don't do it! We couldn't figure out how to make this
work (we didn't try very hard) but had plenty of trouble turning it
off so we could go back to the console interface.</p><p>XFree86
(<a href="http://www.xfree86.org" target="_self">www.xfree86.org</a>)
is an open-source windowing system that runs on Linux and other
operating systems. It isn't the only X Windows System server
available, but it is popular and free. X is different from Windows.
The client/server architecture of X enables users to open a windows
session to a remote host. We won't notice that running the client
and server on the same machine. XFree86 was recently rewritten for
much better screen performance, but we will be installing the older
version 3.3.6-11 that comes with Debian Potato. We will save
installing version 4.x for a later time. It will prove difficult
enough installing the supported 3.x version.</p><p>Install XFree86 by selecting it in dselect. Installing
XFree86 only unpacks the software. It doesn't configure it. There
are several programs available for configuring XFree86. One often
suggested is <span   class="bold"><b>XF86Setup</b></span>, a program
that configures X from within a graphical X application. The
obvious question to ask is: how does this work if you don't have X
configured in the first place? The answer is: better than you would
expect but not good enough. Life is hard enough without trying to
navigate a GUI without a working mouse. The other major
configuration program is a dated console application called
<span   class="bold"><b>xf86config</b></span>. If dselect seems
primitive then xfx86config must be prehistoric. You can't even back
up if you make a mistake. Still, it does the job. Keep starting
over until you get it right.</p><p>Our Hercules Terminator 128 2x/I AGP card is listed as one of
the many cards you can select in xf86config (the 2x/I is #370 in
the database). We were warned by xf86config not to probe clocks or
use any Clocks line with this card, otherwise we could seriously
break something or fry our monitor. You can let the program probe
try to figure out the card by itself. Along the same lines, you
must know the correct specs for your monitor. Our ViewSonic E790
monitor supports a vertical frequency of 50-200KHz and a horizontal
frequency of 30-95KHz. We found that out easily enough on their web
page.</p><p>Why our mouse wouldn't work was a mystery at first. Luckily
we noticed that gpm, the general purpose mouse or console mouse
driver, was one of the packages installed. This will eat mouse
events before X can get them. It is possible to configure X to
daisy chain with gpm. Not being clear why we want gpm anyway, we
simply uninstall it.</p><p>Another package we wish we hadn't installed is
<span   class="bold"><b>xdm</b></span>. We installed it without
knowing what it was when dselect recommended it with a lot of other
X stuff we were installing. What xdm does is automatically launch X
when the computer boots, taking you out of console mode immediately
and making you log in from X. If you have ever used UNIX in a
computer lab you know what this login screen looks like. It is, of
course, a disaster if X won't run because you don't have it
configured yet! We managed to get into a console prompt and put
<b  >exit 0</b> in /etc/init.d/xdm to stop it on
boot.</p><p>If you aren't using xdm then you call
<span   class="bold"><b>startx</b></span> to launch X. As X is
loading, some console messages flash by before the display flips
into graphics mode. If you are having trouble, as we were, you
should specify <b  >startx &gt;&amp; x.log</b> to
redirect those messages to a text file you can study later.
Pressing Ctrl+Alt+Backspace quits the X server to return to console
mode.</p><p>Launching X, it comes up in 16-color 640 x 480 mode,
definitely not what we asked for. Using Ctrl+Alt+keypad+ is
supposed to cycle through the different supported screen
resolutions but has no effect. It isn't until we examine our saved
x.log file that we realize that we are running the generic X server
and not XF86_SVGA as we had specified in xf86config. Nothing warned
us that XF86_SVGA wasn't even installed! We check to find that the
symbolic link at /etc/X11/Xserver doesn't point to it. Another
quick session with dselect sets it right. XF86_SVGA installs
separately from the rest of X. We would have caught that if dselect
was more user-friendly.</p><p>Once we get XFree86 working we need to adjust the frequency
settings to center the image properly on our monitor. The
<span   class="bold"><b>xvidtune</b></span> program handles that
pretty nicely. You interactively adjust the screen until it matches
the appearance you want. However, you can't automatically save that
setting as in Windows. You must paste the setting's output by
xvidtune into your XF86Config file. Once you get it close using
xf86config you will edit the XF86Config file by hand many times
making minor adjustments.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4562f3.large.jpg"><img src="4562f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
xvidtune
</p></div></div><p>A window manager is responsible for the &ldquo;decoration&rdquo; or
look and feel of window frames in X. Many different window managers
are available. Note, we are not talking about desktop managers
here, such as GNOME or KDE. They also include a window manager, but
desktop managers have a lot of other features such as icons on the
desktop, a trash can and a suite of interoperable applications.
They also tend to consume a lot of RAM and be slow. We'll give
GNOME a try sometime, but for now we're sticking to just a simple
window manager.</p><p>The default window manager for Debian is Window Maker. It
seems okay, but we have a problem with it. Perhaps our problem has
a simple solution, but we can't figure it out. How do you take a
screen shot? Without that feature it will be pretty hard to write
this article!</p><p>Blackbox
(<a href="http://blackbox.alug.org" target="_self">http://blackbox.alug.org/</a>)
is a window manager known for being lightweight and sexy. It
supports themes to allow you to drastically change its look and
feel. And, it just seems cool. Using dselect, we install it without
difficulty. Window Maker still comes up as our default window
manager, but when we right click a menu option has been added to
switch to Blackbox. Window Maker was no slouch, but navigating the
same menus in Blackbox is extremely crisp and quick.</p><p>To create our screen snapshots we are using The GIMP. We
could use <span   class="bold"><b>xwpick</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>xgrab</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>xv</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>xdmp</b></span>, but The GIMP is an
application we wanted to install anyway. It is recognized as one of
the best applications available for Linux. The GIMP is very similar
to Photoshop, a popular graphics editing program. To take a screen
shot choose from the menus &ldquo;File&rdquo; &ldquo;Acquire&rdquo; &ldquo;Screen Shot&rdquo;.
Doing that works fine in Blackbox, but for some reason fails in
Window Maker. The GIMP is open source and available for other
operating systems. We use it on WindowsNT, too.</p><p>Amaya is an open-source web browser and editor. We've had
pretty good luck with it in Windows, but when we install the Linux
version, it simply crashes. We're not so interested in Amaya at
this point that we feel like tracking down the trouble. Netscape,
for license reasons, is not included on the Debian CDs. It must be
downloaded from the Netscape site. Although a Solaris version of
Internet Explorer is available, Microsoft doesn't offer a Linux
version.</p><p>We download Netscape for Linux version 4.76
(netscape-smotif-476), the last of the 4.x versions. Netscape 6 is
notorious as a resource hog so we avoid it. Version 5 never was.
Since we don't have a working web browser in Linux (unless you
count the console-mode Lynx browser) we download Netscape by
booting Windows and surfing for it using IE. We save the file to
our FAT16 Windows partition, then reboot to Linux. In Linux we
mount the Windows partition so we can access our download using
<b  >mount -t vfat /dev/hdb1 /win98</b>.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4562f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Netscape Screenshot
</p></div></div><p>There is a method to get dselect to install Netscape after
you download it, but it seems easier to ignore that and do the
standard Netscape install. All nonpackaged installs follow the same
general procedure of changing to the generic install directory and
uncompressing the tar file using the xvfz options:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/install
tar xvfz filename.gz
</pre><p>We then execute the ns-install script to install Netscape.
All is not well, however, because we get an error message when we
try to launch Netscape. It can't load the libstdc shared library.
We are using a different version of that library than Netscape
expects to find. We trick it by finding the library we do have and
creating a link to give it the same name as the missing (obsolete)
library:
<pre     class="programlisting">
find / -name "libstdc*" -print
ln libstdc++-3-libc6.1-2-2.10.0.so libstdc++-libc6.1-1.so.2
</pre>


All that remains is to point Netscape to our proxy server using
&ldquo;Preferences&rdquo; &ldquo;Proxy&rdquo; &ldquo;Manual&rdquo;. We now have a working
graphical web browser.
</p><p>The Hauppauge
(<a href="http://www.hauppauge.com" target="_self">http://www.hauppauge.com/</a>)
WinTV PCI card provides television video in a window. With a price
of about $70 US it has a reputation as one of the best cheap PC TV
video cards around. It works in conjunction with your existing
video card, but not every card is supported. If you are a channel
surfer like me, you may discover you prefer casual TV viewing on
your PC. It's convenient, and you can click through the channels
much faster. WinTV works with many operating systems including
Linux, Windows, FreeBSD and BeOS.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4562f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Hauppauge WinTV
</p></div></div><p>There is a lot of conflicting information on the Web about
installation of Video4Linux (V4L) and the bttv driver used with
WinTV and other cards based on the BT848 chip. There are so many
different driver versions available; that can be confusing. The
version of V4L included with Debian Potato is obsolete, so we won't
use that.</p><p>The current version of V4L requires the i2c bus driver
available in the 2.3 kernel. Use <b  >uname -a</b> to
check what kernel version you have. Since our kernel is 2.2.17 we
must patch it. We don't understand this right away but know
something is wrong because we see a bunch of kcompat.h compile
errors attempting to build V4L from source.</p><p>Before we can build the kernel we must first install the
kernel source using dselect and create a symbolic link:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd usr/src/
ln -s kernel-source-2.2.17 linux
cd linux
</pre><p>We then do <b  >make mrproper</b> to delete any old
kernel compile settings we might have. We use <b  >make
menuconfig</b> to launch the kernel configuration program.
This is a very nice console app. If only xf86config and dselect
looked this good! In menuconfig we install kmod (the new module
loader) and Video4Linux. Everything we can make as a module (NTFS,
VFAT and SMB, but not ext2) we do. There are a lot of options. It
takes several tries before we drill through every menu choice and
pick the appropriate settings.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4562f8.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
menuconfig
</p></div></div>

</p><p>Before compiling our kernel we need to install the new i2c
driver from source as instructed in the bttv FAQ at
www.struse1007.de/bttv/faq.html. The i2c driver supports the
internal serial bus protocol used by the BT848 to tune stations and
so forth:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/install
tar xvgz i2c-2.5.4.tar.gz
cd i2c-2.5.4
vi QUICKSTART
</pre><p>To build the i2c driver we replace the i2c* files in the
kernel sources with our downloaded driver source then build the
driver:
<pre     class="programlisting">
make
</pre>


Now it is back to the kernel to build in the new kernel and
drivers. We first back up our modules directory. We will build and
install all new modules to go with our new kernel:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /lib/modules
cp -r 2.2.17 2.2.17.bak
cd /usr/src/linux
make dep
make bzImage
make modules
make modules_install
</pre>


Back up the old kernel. Edit lilo.conf to be able to boot your old
kernel in case something goes wrong. Install the new kernel. Be
sure to remember to run LILO before shutting down or you won't be
able to boot.
<pre     class="programlisting">
mv vmlinuz vmlinuz.old
vi lilo.conf
vi /boot/bootmess.txt
cp -i /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage
cp -i bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-2.2.17v4l
ln -s /boot/vmlinuz-2.2.17v4l vmlinuz
lilo
</pre>


Go back to i2c-.5.4 and install our 2.3 driver. We ignore
dependency warnings because the old kernel is still running.
<pre     class="programlisting">
make install
depmod -a
</pre>


Install the bttv driver:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tar xvfz bttv-0.7.51.tar.gz
make
make install
depmod -a
</pre>


Shut down using Ctrl+Alt+Delete and reboot. It boots! We are
running our new kernel! A peek at /var/log/messages indicates that
bttv is operating okay.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4562f9.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
XawTV
</p></div></div>

</p><p>Because we installed the current version of V4L we also
install the current version of the XawTV viewer program. It won't
start because it can't find its X resources. The docs aren't much
help. On a hunch we install the old versions of XawTV and fbtv from
the Debian CDs, then overwrite it with the new version of
XawTV:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar xvfz xaw.3.26.tar.gz
make
make install
</pre><p>That works! We right click to get the settings menu, make
some adjustments, then use the arrow keys to tune channels. We can
now view television on our X desktop.
</p><p>To recap, the sequence we followed was to install XFree86,
configure it, install The GIMP and Netscape, install the updated
i2c driver from source, patch the kernel and install Video4Linux
and XawTV. Next month we will take a close look at Linux MPEG movie
players. We will also install BeOS under LILO and compare using our
WinTV card in Linux with BeOS and Windows.</p></div></div>
