    Three key problems face Linux as an internet
    platform today: security, proprietary software and the high cost
    of popularity. Naturally, <i  >Linux Journal</i> will help you attack all
    three.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29a6580.0x2a9e450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Linux comes from the Internet and thrives
on the Internet. As the desktop Linux community struggles with
proprietary formats and user lock-in, you might think those of us
who are just doing network services have it easy. Wrong. Three key
problems face Linux as an Internet platform today: security,
proprietary software and the high cost of popularity. Naturally,
<i  >Linux Journal</i> will help you attack all three.
</p><p>Networks need high-quality, secure software. Open-source
licenses and development models are an important step toward that,
but last year <i  >Linux Journal</i> warned the
shovelware mongers, I mean Linux distributions, that their default
installs were loading users up with too many potentially
exploitable services and that they should start locking things down
by default. But did they listen? No. Now we have the &ldquo;Red Hat
Ramen Worm&rdquo;, and proprietary software PR people blaming Linux for
one distribution's irresponsible decision. From what I see, though,
it could have been any of the distributions, so if you're not Red
Hat don't think I'm not talking to you too.</p><p>Mick Bauer is writing about Bastille this month, and it
certainly helps, but the very existence of a security package as an
add-on is profoundly backward&mdash;like taking delivery of a car with
no bumpers or seatbelts and having to get a local mechanic to
install them. Exploits happen, but worm epidemics wouldn't be a
public embarrassment for Linux if the distributions would just make
a secure posture the default.</p><p>If you must run FTP (and most systems don't need to) please,
please don't run some huge, deluxe, featureful FTP d&aelig;mon
written back in ancient times, when there was no secure alternative
to FTP for password-protected file transfers. Use a minimal
&ldquo;anonymous-only&rdquo; d&aelig;mon such as
<span   class="bold"><b>oftpd</b></span> (page 92) and be
happy.</p><p>It might be hard for some of you to imagine the prospect of
not having e-mail at work&mdash;but that's where Stew Benedict found
himself. It's an old story for us but an inspiring one&mdash;set up a
single, inexpensive Linux box to offer e-mail to lots of users.
Internet e-mail dramatically changes work environments, as lots
more people get information and help from the outside. Especially
in bleak, brain-stifling places it changes the way people work for
the better&mdash;and Stew did it on the smallest of budgets. Read how on
page 100.</p><p>No networking issue would be complete without some discussion
of the question &ldquo;How can I get more performance out of my web
site?&rdquo; Ibrahim Haddad and Makan Pourzandi find an answer from the
bottom up, using the classic &ldquo;load balanced cluster&rdquo; approach and
the free Linux Virtual Server Project software [see page 84].
That's a workable solution for your business web site today&mdash;don't
let yourself get bamboozled into proprietary load balancing or
clustering.</p><p>When Richard Stallman wrote &ldquo;Join us now and share the
software, you'll be free, hackers, you'll be free,&rdquo; he forgot
&ldquo;sane&rdquo;. License managers, incompatible binary-only kernel modules
and lack of tweakability are sending more than one webmaster over
the edge. So get the free stuff and have time to make the site
better, don't just work around some idiot marketing person's
conception of how your site should work.</p><p>The Web is great, but the tragedy of popular independent web
sites is that they start to require more bandwidth and server power
than their creator can afford. At that point, the webmaster either
&ldquo;sells out&rdquo; to a business that starts carrying ads, tracking
users and doing other nasty stuff, or the site dies out. Naturally,
the vendors of big bandwidth and big iron love this.</p><p>Freenet to the rescue. This much-hyped system really
works&mdash;Peter Todd sent us his Freenet article over Freenet. Think
of it as a distributed Berkeley DB, but one where you can get your
data back from any Freenet &ldquo;node&rdquo;, not just the one where you
stored it. It's a little more complicated than that, but honestly,
not much.</p><p>Freenet's decentralized architecture was originally intended
to keep the Man from suppressing underground newspapers and hash
brownie recipes. But more importantly, it's becoming an
architecture for sustaining web-like sites and Usenet-like groups
while sharing the costs of servers and bandwidth among all the
readers, not just slamming the creators. Get a DSL line, join
Freenet (page 96), and soon your favorite sites won't have to make
the decision of whether to shut down or sell out.</p><p>The fundamental advantage of packet-switched networks is that
they disproportionately reward economically efficient and moral
behavior. But like the HVAC system in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Brazil</em></span>,
networks &ldquo;don't fix themselves, sir.&rdquo; Put some effort into
security, free software and free peer-to-peer systems, and the
network will pay you back many times over.</p><p>Peace and Linux.</p><p>&mdash;Don Marti, Technical Editor</p><p><a href="4262s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
