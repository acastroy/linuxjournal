    On LinuxPPC, LinuxFund.org and more.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a3580.0x169b500"></a></h2></div></div><p> This has been a big month in the .org
world. I think some of the most interesting news (in full below) is
the migration of LinuxPPC from a for-profit company to a nonprofit
.org. LinuxPPC was originally conceived as a nonprofit, but the
market dictated for profit, and now the timing is right to make the
move back to its original vision. The principals will no longer
need to worry about path-to-profitability issues.
</p><p>I think it begs the question that has been asked hundreds of
times: can for-profit companies succeed in Linux? The answer lies
in how well for-profit companies interface with the .org world.
Those that have very active community efforts seem to be thriving,
while many who pop on to the scene without an understanding of what
the Linux community is really all about are swimming upstream. A
solid community outreach program should be an integral part of any
project's strategy. The need to be hooked into the .org world has
never been stronger.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a3580.0x169b660"></a>Profile&mdash;LinuxFund.org</h2></div></div><p>LinuxFund.org
(<a href="http://www.linuxfund.org" target="_self">www.linuxfund.org</a>)
raises capital to fund high-quality Linux projects by issuing an
affinity MasterCard. The project is headed by Benjamin Cox who
describes himself as &ldquo;the financial world's version of a hacker&rdquo;.
In eighteen months, LinuxFund.org has issued more than 5,000 credit
cards and looks to fund two or three projects per month.</p><p>Any project in the world can apply, but they must be
completely open source and help the development and direction of
open-source software. The organization is currently funding fewer
projects per year at $3,000 per project but are looking to spread
the fund wider by offering more $1,000 grants. They are actively
seeking projects to endow. They'd also like to eventually be a
source to find information on interesting open-source
projects.</p><p>LinuxFund.org does not solicit or accept donations. The sole
source of their funding comes from the affinity credit card. Cox
feels that the card acts as an ambassador for Linux. Nearly every
time he uses it, someone comments on the card, Cox said.</p><p>LinuxFund.org is actively looking for projects to fund.
Submissions can be posted on-line at the organization's web site,
<a href="http://www.linuxfund.org" target="_self">http://www.linuxfund.org/</a>.
They are also always in the market for web development help.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a3580.0x169b920"></a>News Briefs</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>LinuxPPC Becomes a Nonprofit
Organization:</b></span> LinuxPPC
(<a href="http://www.linuxppc.com" target="_self">www.linuxppc.com</a>)
announced plans to become a nonprofit organization (NPO). The NPO
will focus on the development and promotion of the Linux operating
system on the PowerPC processor. Jeff Carr, LinuxPPC's founder,
originally registered the linuxppc.org domain with the intention of
creating a not-for-profit organization. However, it was officially
created as a for-profit corporation because it was less difficult
and less expensive than creating an NPO.</p><p>The organization states that since many of the ideas and
principles of nonprofit organizations perfectly match the ideas and
principles of the free software movement, the company calls the
move &ldquo;a natural step in LinuxPPC's evolution&rdquo;. The transition is
expected to take several months and will not affect the services
offered by the organization. LinuxPPC is headquartered in Waukesha,
Wisconsin.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Free Software Foundation (FSF) Award
for the Advancement of Free Software:</b></span> The Free Software
Foundation
(<a href="http://www.gnu.org" target="_self">http://www.gnu.org/</a>)
bestowed its third award for the Advancement of Free Software to VA
Linux employee, Brian Paul. Brian was given the award for his work
on the Mesa 3-D graphics library. The award, a one-of-a-kind
handmade quilt, was presented by Richard Stallman at the Linux Expo
in Paris.</p><p>Brian was selected from three finalists who were all honored
at the award ceremony. The other finalists were Donald Becker,
nominated for his network device drivers for the GNU/Linux system
and for the Beowulf Project; and Patrick Lenz for his work on
<a href="http://freshmeat.net" target="_self">freshmeat.net</a>, a
vital site for news and information on free software.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>GNOME Foundation:</b></span> The GNOME
Foundation announced that RedFlag Software Co., Ltd. has joined the
foundation. RedFlag will spearhead an effort to localize GNOME into
Simplified Chinese.</p><p>&ldquo;With the localization of GNOME, businesses and individuals
in China can enjoy the power, cost-effectiveness and ease of use of
free software,&rdquo; said Havoc Pennington, GNOME Foundation board
chair. &ldquo;In addition, talented programmers in China will be able to
utilize the modern architecture and design of GNOME for application
development.&rdquo;</p><p>RedFlag will lead GNOME Foundation efforts in China, focusing
on education, support and marketing. It will also join the
volunteer efforts of more than 500 of the world's most talented
software designers and programmers who are currently working on
GNOME or GNOME-compatible programs.</p></div></div>
