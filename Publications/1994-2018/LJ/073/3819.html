happening with 3dfx graphics hardware and the port to Glide? Read
on.</em></span>
</p><p>The last time we talked to Daryl Strauss, he was working for
Digital Domain, helping them generate graphics for the movie
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Titanic</em></span>--that was February 1998. Daryl has
since moved on to work for Precision Insight, where he has
continued to work in the area of 3-D graphics. Steven Pritchard
talked to Daryl about his current projects at the end of last
year.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Steven</b></span>: First of all, for
those who don't know you, can you give a little bit of background
on yourself? Specifically, how did you get involved in porting
Glide to Linux, how long ago was that, and what exactly is your job
description now?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Daryl</b></span>: I started working on
the 3dfx hardware just about three years ago. When the original
Voodoo graphics came out, I looked at the specs and noticed that
the performance numbers were very close to the original SGI reality
engine. Since I knew the reality engine was a box that you could do
real work on, I knew the Voodoo Graphics would be a very capable
card. It literally changed the way the PC industry did 3-D
graphics.</p><p>I ran out and bought an Orchid Righteous 3-D for $300 when
they first became available. I wasn't disappointed. 3dfx has made
the developer kit available to anyone from the very beginning. I
downloaded it and noticed they had mentioned Linux in the
documentation as being TBD. There were also a few
<b  >#ifdefs</b> in the headers. So, I knew someone there
understood Linux. I went ahead and applied to their developer
program to port the libraries to Linux.</p><p>It took about six months to work out all the details and
about two weeks to do the first port. I think they were sort of
surprised it happened so quickly, because there was another delay
before the first version got posted on a web site.</p><p>Since then, I've continued to support the rest of their
boards. This was always done as a volunteer effort in my spare
time. Sometimes my real job got in the way. The work on the Voodoo
Banshee took me a long time to get done, because it required
writing an X driver (which I had never done before) and I was very
busy creating the special effects for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Titanic</em></span>
while that was happening.</p><p>Back in April, I realized that Linux was ready to have a
large impact on the 3-D graphics industry. I left my job as
software manager at Digital Domain and joined Precision Insight. My
title there is Visual Mason and Evangelist. In June, Precision
Insight signed a contract with 3dfx to develop a DRI implementation
for their Voodoo Banshee and Voodoo 3, 4 and 5 hardware.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Steven</b></span>: What exactly was
just released today? What cards are supported? When do you
anticipate a &ldquo;production&rdquo; release?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Daryl</b></span>: This is a pre-release
of an implementation of the OpenGL API for the Voodoo Banshee and
Voodoo3 based on Precision Insight's Direct Rendering
Infrastructure. That's quite a mouthful. What that means is users
can run applications written for OpenGL in a window on a Linux
system with a Voodoo Banshee or Voodoo3.</p><p>Another key feature of this release is the entire
implementation is open source. Now that the basic capabilities are
running, we're going to set it up as a public project so that
anyone who wants may contribute.</p><p>It is still a pre-release, which means we know it still has
bugs. We're getting it out there so that people can start trying to
run their applications and see how they behave. We want to identify
any issues. The final release will be in 2000.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Steven</b></span>: Do you know if 3dfx
takes Linux seriously, or if they just consider it a niche
market?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Daryl</b></span>: I can't speak for
3dfx. They were the first, and one of the few companies, to put
money into a fully open-source solution for Linux. That's a big
level of commitment. Some companies have released some code and
some have released some specs, but few companies are making code
and specs available and putting money into the development.</p><p>With that said, Linux is somewhat of a niche market today.
Linux systems represent a very small number of sales. 3dfx realizes
this is changing quickly. They want to get involved early so they
can catch Linux as it grows.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Steven</b></span>: How much do you know
(or rather, how much can you tell me) about the new chip set and
boards that 3dfx just announced? Are Linux drivers being developed?
If so, will they be ready when the boards ship?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Daryl</b></span>: 3dfx has published a
lot of material on the new Voodoo4 and Voodoo5 chip sets. The key
component is what they call the Voodoo Scalable Architecture. The
first chip is the VSA-100. You can put between one and thirty-two
of these chips together on a board. The fill rate on each chip (the
number of pixels that can be drawn on the screen in a second) is a
very impressive 333 megapixels. They've also improved the
capabilities of the chip from that of the Voodoo3; it does 32bpp,
stencils, 2048x2048 textures, texture compression, more color-blend
modes, and a few powerful features called the T-buffer which allows
full-scene hardware anti-aliasing. These boards will be very
compatible with the OpenGL API.</p><p>Precision Insight will be working with 3dfx to support the
Voodoo 4 and Voodoo5 boards. At this point, we haven't announced a
release date for that software.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Steven</b></span>: The specs on the
Voodoo5 6000 look fairly impressive. Do you know if 3dfx is still
just targeting gamers, or are they planning on targeting more
&ldquo;professional&rdquo; 3-D users?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Daryl</b></span>: The distinction
between &ldquo;gamers&rdquo; and &ldquo;professionals&rdquo; is sort of artificial.
What really matters is the sort of application being run. There are
professionals who develop simulations (such as flight simulators or
arcade systems) for whom these will be excellent boards. Quantum3D
is a partner with 3dfx and will sell high-end configurations of the
VSA-100 chip for this sort of user.</p><p>The real question is whether your application is fill-rate
limited or triangle-rate limited. Digital content creation systems
(CAD, 3-D modelers, etc.) are more likely to be triangle-rate
limited. They have to draw many very small triangles. On these
boards, all that work is done on the host CPU, and even with the
very fast CPUs now available, it is likely that you couldn't push
them through to the graphics board fast enough to keep it busy. If
your application draws bigger triangles or needs to do a lot of
work with multiple-texture maps, it might be able to take advantage
of the extra fill rate in these boards.</p><p>So, to answer your question, yes, I think these will be
reasonable cards for any application, particularly with the new
features they've added to the architecture. But, 3dfx is targeting
the consumer, and that's where these boards will work the
best.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Steven</b></span>: What brought on the
sudden decision to open the source to Glide?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Daryl</b></span>: You'd have to ask
them for a real answer. From my discussions, it is mostly that they
want to have their hardware supported on as many platforms as
possible, and open sourcing Glide seemed like the best
answer.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Steven</b></span>: What license is 3dfx
using for the Glide source? Will it be possible to include it with
the Mesa (or X) source?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Daryl</b></span>: They made their own,
but my reading was that it is basically LGPL. That means it can't
go into X. It could go into Mesa, but I'm not sure we truly want
that. It makes a reasonable stand-alone package.</p><p>A different, more ambitious project would be to remove the
dependency on Glide from Mesa. That's a big project, but it might
be interesting for people to pick up if they want to learn more
about writing drivers.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Steven</b></span>: Are drivers for any
of the extra features, like the TV tuner on the V3 3500, being
developed?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Daryl</b></span>: Not by us. I believe
they want to release the specs on them. The TV parts are a standard
one for which you can get the data sheet. 3dfx will be releasing
more specs fairly soon, so that may have the TV details. I'm not
sure.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Steven</b></span>: Was Precision
Insight contracted to work on the Voodoo drivers on an ongoing
basis or just for the initial implementation?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Daryl</b></span>: We have a contract
that includes work on the V4/V5 and to do some work on future
boards. We may see more work after that, but this contract covers
us for a reasonable period of time. We're not being contracted to
do the end-user support. 3dfx will be doing that themselves.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Steven</b></span>: What other companies
have contracted Precision Insight to write DRI drivers? Are you
working on drivers for any other cards?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Daryl</b></span>: The only companies
that have announced anything publicly are 3dfx, ATI and
Intel.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Steven</b></span>: Keep up the good
work, and thanks for talking to us.</p></div></div>
