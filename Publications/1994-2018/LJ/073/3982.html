    &ldquo;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are
    created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights,
    that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of....&rdquo;
    &mdash;Thomas Jefferson
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x281d580.0x29156b8"></a></h2></div></div><p> The last word in the first draft of
Thomas Jefferson's most famous sentence was &ldquo;property&rdquo;, not
&ldquo;happiness&rdquo; Perhaps that's because Jefferson always had a problem
stretching the meaning of &ldquo;property&rdquo; over things that are not
material&mdash;especially the good ideas we call inventions.
</p><p>An inventor himself, Jefferson administered the country's
first patent law in 1790. Historian David F. Noble says Jefferson
and his colleagues applied the law &ldquo;under very strict standards,
and relatively few patents were issued.&rdquo; Jefferson explained some
of his concerns in a letter to Isaac McPherson in 1813. The letter
concerned a disputed invention by Oliver Evans, called a
&ldquo;hopper-boy&rdquo;.</p><p>After detailing the debts Mr. Evans' invention owed to past
inventors ranging from Archimedes to a Virginia farmer, Jefferson
wearily wrote, &ldquo;The hopper-boy is a useful machine, and so far as
I know, original.&rdquo; Then he launched into a digression that has
haunted patent law ever since, and it also described principles of
creation that would not see full expression until they produced the
Internet nearly two hundred years later:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>It would be curious then, if an idea, the
fugitive fermentation of an individual brain, could, of natural
right, be claimed in exclusive and stable property. If nature has
made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive
property, it is the action of the thinking power called an
idea.</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The moment [an idea] is divulged, it forces
itself into the possession of everyone, and the receiver cannot
dispossess himself of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives
instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his
taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>That ideas should freely spread from one to
another over the globe seems to have been peculiarly and
benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire,
expansible over all space, without lessening their density at any
point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our
physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive
appropriation.</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject
of property.</p></blockquote></div><p>Coming early in the Industrial Age, this was not a catchy
idea. The truth of it may have been self-evident to Jefferson, but
it was lost on nearly everyone else. The material nature of
property was beyond dispute. Even Karl Marx, that great enemy of
private property, was a devout materialist who made a big deal
about who ought to own what.
</p><p>Now Jefferson's second revolution is underway. While the
first one overthrew a colonial government, the second one
overthrows an industrial economy. While both sought to create ideal
conditions for free expression, the second one does it by creating
a whole new world&mdash;one based on the principles Jefferson described
in his letter to McPherson.</p><p>By the terms of these principles, this revolution is not
about e-commerce, dot-com startups or money lavished like free
cocaine on every zero billion-dollar entrepreneurial impulse that
connects with the venture capital syndicate on Sand Hill Road. It's
about the kindlings of wealth those venture dollars ignite:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ideas</em></span> which catch and spread across the globe,
illuminating everything and darkening nothing&mdash;and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>inventions</em></span> which put those ideas to
work.</p><p>This new world, the Internet, is a work of
nature&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>our</em></span> nature, as social and original
beings. It is, without a doubt, the best thing we have ever done
for ourselves. It connects across every space that divides us and
gives us efficient new ways to meet, talk, teach, learn, gossip,
argue, tell stories and do business.</p><p>As a natural habitat for business, the Internet is utopia.
For proof, just step back twenty years and take a look. The
threshold of enterprise is approximately zero. New business
concepts catch and spread at the speed of gossip. The average
distance from idea to wealth is reduced from decades to months,
millionaires are minted by the minute and billionaires by the day.
Vast quantities of fresh money are lavished on every credible
ambition, with instructions to set bonfires with it in the midst of
the marketplace, without collateral and with minimal personal risk.
New companies with negligible revenues are valued entirely for
their promise without regard for material intrinsics, turning Wall
Street into a casino where the house hardly stands a chance (and in
fact does not exist).</p><p>In the midst of it all, unprecedented sums of work get
done.</p><p>The great irony here is that this utopia was not built like
an empire, or by people who were, in Walt Whitman's words,
&ldquo;consumed with the mania of owning things&rdquo;. It was built like an
Amish barn by hackers who made it because they needed it, and it
sure wasn't going to come from the old software industry. The
result was a second world&mdash;one made with code rather than
matter&mdash;that embodied and expressed the long-overlooked virtues of
the first:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>No one owns it.</p></li><li><p>Everyone can use it.</p></li><li><p>Anyone can improve it.</p></li></ul></div><p>These principles are so basic, they undermine all efforts to
deny them.
</p><p>The gears of the old patent system can't get a purchase on
this new world, even though the Supreme Court decided in 1998 that
software and &ldquo;business methods&rdquo; were patentable. It has been
amazing to watch the patent stampede that followed this wacky
decision. Thousands of patents were filed to stake out claims in
empty space. Now that the first of these patents are getting
approved, we're starting to see lawsuits. The Amazon and Priceline
suits are only the most familiar ones. There will be many
more.</p><p>There will also be much garment-rending and teeth-gnashing
over the &ldquo;threats&rdquo; these patents and lawsuits pose to our new
&ldquo;World of Code&rdquo;. These new patents are patently outrageous, but
they are also futile. Nature will take care of business.</p><p>Markets are conversations. You have to talk with them. If you
try to command and control them the old-fashioned way, they'll get
bored and move on. The rules of Darwin still apply: if you want to
evolve, you have to adapt or else you die.</p><p>Companies that choose to evolve will need to adapt to the
gift culture that produced our utopia. &ldquo;Gift cultures,&rdquo; Eric
Raymond says, &ldquo;are adaptations not to scarcity but to
abundance.... In gift cultures, social status is determined not by
what you control but by <span   class="emphasis"><em>what you give away</em></span>.&rdquo;
The italics are his. This gift is ours.</p></div></div>
