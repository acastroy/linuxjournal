    Scripting with EX and Here files.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f36580.0x202e608"></a></h2></div></div><p>At some point in your dealings with UNIX
and Linux, you may need to write a script which edits critical
system files such as /etc/passwd or the rc boot scripts. Whatever
the file, if your script messes it up, your machine will suffer
because of it. Half-hearted scripting, which may be sufficient for
normal files, will not work in these situations.
</p><p>Consider the root password. If you need to modify the root
password on one machine, it's quite easy using the
<span   class="bold"><b>passwd</b></span> command. But if you need to
change the root password on 50 or more machines, the problem is
much more difficult. It could still be done by hand, but this would
be time-consuming and prone to errors. One way to solve this
problem is by using EX.</p><p>If you view the man page for EX on Red Hat Linux, you will
get the man page for <span   class="bold"><b>vim</b></span> instead.
This is no mistake. EX is the engine underneath the familiar
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> interface. All the power of vi
is available from within your scripts, if you know how to access
it.</p><p>Let's start with some simple edits and work our way up to the
root password change example.</p><p><a href="3771l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>Listing 1 shows a simple multi-line file. Suppose we wanted
to remove the first line containing the word &ldquo;three&rdquo;. We could
write the short script in Listing 2 to accomplish this
easily.</p><p>Lines 1 through 6 in Listing 2 should be familiar to anyone
who has done shell scripting. If you have never written a script, I
recommend the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning the bash Shell</em></span>
(see Resources) to get started.</p><p><a href="3771l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>Line 5 is where the interesting stuff begins. We call EX with
the -s option to tell EX to run in silent mode. The file we are
operating on is entered next, in the <b  >$TARGET</b>
variable. The uninteresting output of EX is redirected to /dev/null
because we don't want it to clutter any output of the script
itself. You can delete <b  >&gt;/dev/null</b> if you
would like to see this information during debug. The
<b  >&lt;&lt;E_O_F</b> marks the beginning of a &ldquo;Here&rdquo;
file.</p><p>A Here file is a way of placing the contents of a file within
a script. The line after <b  >&lt;&lt;E_O_F</b> is the
first line of the file. The Here file consists of all lines up to
the line beginning with E_O_F. This tag (which ends the Here file)
can be any unique character combination. We are using E_O_F here
out of convention. The &ldquo;&lt;&lt;&rdquo; has the effect of feeding the
contents of the Here file to EX, which uses those commands to edit
the <b  >$TARGET</b> file. Notice that the Here file is
not indented. If we were to change <b  >&lt;&lt;E_O_F</b>
to <b  >&lt;&lt;-E_O_F</b>, adding the &ldquo;-&rdquo;, we could
indent the Here file with <b  >TAB</b> characters. If
those <b  >TAB</b> characters somehow became spaces,
perhaps by a copy-and-paste operation, the Here file will cease to
work, the E_O_F will never be seen and the contents of your script
below the E_O_F marker will be fed to EX, creating unpredictable
output. For this reason, I make it a personal policy to never
indent Here files. For more information on Here files, see the book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX Power Tools</em></span> (in Resources).</p><p>The first line of the Here file is line 6, which contains a
1. This forces the line pointer in EX to the first line of the
file. While this is not completely necessary for the script to
work, it does eliminate any confusion as to where subsequent
searches begin during your edit. I find it to be a helpful
programming practice.</p><p>Line 7 is a regular expression. EX uses this regular
expression to search through the <b  >$TARGET</b> file
and set its line pointer to the first line containing the word
&ldquo;three&rdquo;. In listing 1, this is line 3. The trailing &ldquo;d&rdquo; in line
10's regular expression tells EX to delete that line. Line 8 is
familiar to vi users. It says to write, quit and &ldquo;don't argue with
me&rdquo;. Line 9 is the E_O_F tag, which marks the end of the Here
file.</p><p><a href="3771l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p>We could add lines to the file with the
<span   class="bold"><b>a</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>i</b></span> commands. Listing 3 shows
examples of this. Notice the trailing &ldquo;d&rdquo; is gone from the
regular expression. We are using the regular expression to set the
line pointer, not delete the line. The
<span   class="bold"><b>a</b></span> appends a line after the line
defined in the regular expression, and the
<span   class="bold"><b>i</b></span> command inserts a line before
the line defined in the regular expression. The
<span   class="bold"><b>.</b></span> command tells EX to leave edit
mode, similar to pressing the <b  >ESC</b> key in vi. The
last EX example in Listing 3 changes the 1 to a $, forcing the line
pointer to the end of the file. We then append a line, which has
the same effect as this command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo "This line is added at the bottom of the \
file." &gt;&gt; $TARGET
</pre><p><a href="3771l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a>
</p><p>Now that we have simple edits under our belt, let's look at
the more complicated problem mentioned earlier of changing multiple
root passwords. Once we have changed one password with the passwd
command, we can copy and paste the password hash from /etc/shadow
into a variable in a script. Listing 4 contains the script. The
<b  >REPL_STRING</b> variable contains the new password
hash. Notice we had to escape &ldquo;$&rdquo;, &ldquo;.&rdquo; and &ldquo;/&rdquo; with
backslashes to prevent EX from interpreting these as special
characters and giving unpredictable output. As you see, the only
major difference between this script and the earlier examples is
the regular expression.</p><p>Due to space constraints, I will not fully explain the
regular expression here except to say it has the effect of
&ldquo;remembering&rdquo; everything on each side of the existing password
field and adding that to each side of the
<b  >REPL_STRING</b> variable, making up a new root line
in the /etc/passwd file. At the end of the script, we use
<span   class="bold"><b>pwconv</b></span> to put the new password
hash into the /etc/shadow file. This script can be put in a place
that all machines can mount and can be remotely executed by each
machine, giving them all the same root password.</p><p>As you can see, the file editing power of your scripts with
EX is limited only by your knowledge of regular expressions. If you
don't currently use regular expressions, they are well worth taking
the time to learn. For more information on regular expressions,
read the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mastering Regular Expressions</em></span>
(see Resources).</p><p><a href="3771s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
