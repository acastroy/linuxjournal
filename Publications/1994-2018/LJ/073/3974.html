    Installing and upgrading software need not be
    difficult&mdash;Monsieur Gagn&eacute; tempts us with delectable RPM.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x294b580.0x2a43710"></a></h2></div></div><p>Fran&ccedil;ois! Why did you not tell me
imm&eacute;diatement that these distinguished diners had arrived?
Run along, now. Vite! Bring the '82 Margaux from the cellar.
</p><p>Forgive me, mes amis, for not welcoming you sooner.
Fran&ccedil;ois does not like to disturb me when I sample, or
rather, take inventory of the wine cellar. Please, sit down, and
welcome once more to Chez Marcel. As you know, this month's issue
features delightful forays into the world of software
development.</p><p>Installing and distributing software can be a difficult task.
For the, shall we say, not-so-technical users, untarring and
unzipping source, compiling, installing and keeping track of all
that has been done can be daunting. Upgrading that software once
the deed is done can be another trial. This is what a package
manager seeks to simplify. The most popular and versatile of these
is RPM, the Red Hat Package Manager. With RPM, you can make
managing your distribution an easy process for the end user by
transforming the whole process of untarring, compiling, installing
and cleaning up into a single, one-line command. RPM even maintains
a database of installed products so that you can verify installed
software for completeness or query file locations.</p><p>A number of Linux distributions come with RPM as their
package manager of choice. You'll find RPM used by Red Hat,
Caldera, Mandrake and TurboLinux, just to name a few. Even if your
Linux distribution does not come with RPM, you can still install
and use it. What's even more exciting is that RPM will run on a
number of other UNIX flavors as well. These include AIX, HP-UX,
IRIX and others. I can hear the ads now: &ldquo;The Red Hat Package
Manager . . . it's not just for Red Hat anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>Your taste buds are proving Monsieur Pavlov correct, non? You
want to try your own hand at distributing your software using RPM,
but you do not know where to begin? Follow me into the kitchen and
I will show you a simple recipe for creating your own RPMs.</p><p>Let's pretend I want to distribute a clever little package
called <span   class="bold"><b>gatekeeper</b></span>, version 1.0.
This neat little piece of <span   class="emphasis"><em>hypothetical</em></span>
software comes with a web interface for authentication, a CGI
script which calls a small setuid program, which then calls another
Perl script to update /etc/hosts.allow in order to grant access.
The installed files are as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/home/httpd/html/gatekeeper/keypad.html
/home/httpd/cgi-bin/gatekeeper/locksmith.pl
/usr/local/.Admin/sethosts.pl
/usr/local/bin/suguard
</pre><p>My setuid program is <span   class="bold"><b>suguard</b></span>
and will therefore install with setuid permissions, while the .pl
files will require standard executable permissions for CGI scripts.
We should perhaps add a README to go with this collection. We also
want to release this software under the GNU Public License. So,
where do we go from here?
</p><p>The first step in creating your new RPM is to build a .spec
file, the basic configuration file for RPM. It is essentially a
recipe that RPM uses to build your final package. As with any
recipe, you have some flexibility in terms of what can be added or
removed, but there are basics that should be followed. After all,
if you make <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tourti&egrave;re</em></span> with apples
instead of meat, you have apple pie with vegetables and spices and
it just does not work. Even Fran&ccedil;ois may not be able to
provide you with enough wine to wash that down.</p><p>We will now cover the details of this recipe, the spec .file.
In my case, it is called gatekeeper-1.0-<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>.spec
and is broken up into sections addressing specific characteristics
of the distribution package to be built. The important sections are
the &ldquo;preamble&rdquo;, &ldquo;%prep&rdquo;, &ldquo;%build&rdquo;, &ldquo;%install&rdquo; and
&ldquo;%files&rdquo;. The preamble is a description of the package: release
information, who built it and where to obtain the source. As the
name implies, this is located right at the top of my .spec file.
Unlike the other sections, it has no header&mdash;you simply begin the
file with it. For my gatekeeper program, I have the following
preamble:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Summary: Allows authorized clients firewall access
Name: gatekeeper
Version: 1.0
Release: 1
Copyright: GPL
Group: Applications/Networking
Source: ftp://ftp.mycompany.com/pub/packages/gatekeeper-1.0.tar.gz
URL: http://www.mycompany.com/
Packager: Chef Marcel
ExclusiveArch: i386
</pre><p>We begin with a simple summary description of the package.
This is followed by the name, a version number, and a release
number. If you have ever downloaded or installed with RPM, you are
familiar with what is happening here. My package, when complete,
will be named gatekeeper-1.0-1.i386.rpm. I include a copyright
statement, the source location (where the package can be downloaded
using FTP), a URL for documentation on the package, and the chef
who put the whole package together is mentioned as &ldquo;Packager&rdquo;.
</p><p>For an example of where this becomes useful, try giving the
command below to any package on your system. For example, let's
query the &ldquo;net-tools&rdquo; package:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -qi net-tools
</pre><p>Here is the output from that command.
<pre     class="programlisting">

</pre>


Next, in my &ldquo;.spec&rdquo; file, I include a
<b  >%description</b> heading. In this section, I include
a somewhat more descriptive explanation of the package than my
simple one-liner at the top of the last section. In a way, this is
part of the first section, in that it makes up the total package
description.
<pre     class="programlisting">
%description
Allows authorized clients firewall access
What makes this so cool is that clients with
dynamic IP addresses can still be allowed access
to network resources with proper authentication.
After a set inactivity time (fifteen minutes),
access is deleted from the system.
</pre>


So far, we have a lot of information, but now the real work begins.
If you look at this next section closely
(<b  >%prep</b>), you'll see it is just a place to put
commands that prepare your sources (or in my examples, a few
scripts) for building. You could conceivably just call a shell
script to do everything, or list the commands specifically. You'll
see it is fairly simple.
<pre     class="programlisting">
%prep
rm -rf $RPM_BUILD_DIR/gatekeeper-1.0
zcat $RPM_SOURCE_DIR/gatekeeper-1.0.tar.gz |
tar -xvf -
</pre>


Some of these section headers are actually powerful macros. For
instance, the <b  >%setup</b> header for the next section
can do a fair bit without being given any arguments. (In exactly
the same way I did not! Very clever, non?) What this macro does
without any help is unpack the sources (the tar.gz file) and move
(using cd) into that directory&mdash;very nice. You can also add some
flags to this macro to customize your build. Today, we'll keep
things simple:
<pre     class="programlisting">
%setup
</pre>


While we look at this lonely but powerful <b  >%setup</b>
macro, I should point out that there is another. A
<b  >%patch</b> macro is available to help you easily
apply patches to your build. Next in line is the
<b  >%build</b> section:
<pre     class="programlisting">
%build
</pre>


Ah, yes, another lonely section. Fran&ccedil;ois, could you pour a
glass of wine for our build section to help it through its
loneliness? Sit down, Fran&ccedil;ois; I was only joking. What we
have here is a section that is open to any shell commands you may
need to use in order to build your package. For instance, if I was
working with a source package, I could have something like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
%build
ftl_drive_preparations
make depend
make
</pre>


Obviously, this would be a much higher tech package than I am
building here, non?
</p><p>As we move down the .spec file, the demands for detail
increase. For instance, the <b  >%install</b> section
contains a list of commands necessary to install the package: any
directory creation commands, install commands and anything else
required. You could also simply call another shell script or a
<b  >make install</b>. I prefer my .spec file to reflect
what happens with my build. Note the backslashes for lines that
were too long to fit in this example.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
%install
mkdir -p $RPM_BUILD_ROOT/home/httpd/html/gatekeeper
mkdir -p $RPM_BUILD_ROOT/home/httpd/cgi-bin/gatekeeper
mkdir -p $RPM_BUILD_ROOT/usr/local/.Admin
mkdir -p $RPM_BUILD_ROOT/usr/local/bin
install -m 644 home/httpd/html/scidns/keypad.html\
$RPM_BUILD_ROOT/home/httpd/html/scidns/keypad.html
install -m 755 home/httpd/cgi-bin/scidns/locksmith.pl
$RPM_BUILD_ROOT/home/httpd/cgi-bin/scidns/locksmith.pl
install -m 755 usr/local/.Admin/sethosts.pl \
$RPM_BUILD_ROOT/usr/local/.Admin/sethosts.pl
install -m 4755 usr/local/bin/suguard \
$RPM_BUILD_ROOT/usr/local/bin/suguard
</pre><p>Almost there, mes amis. When we have finished putting our RPM
binary together, we should clean up after ourselves, non? This is
where we do it. This is the <b  >%clean</b> section.
<pre     class="programlisting">
%clean
rm -rf $RPM_BUILD_ROOT
</pre>


Now we come to our final section, <b  >%files</b>. This
is simply a list of all files that make up your package. Keep in
mind that the files must be listed here&mdash;anything missing in this
section will not make it into the final RPM.
<pre     class="programlisting">
%files
%doc README
/home/httpd/html/gatekeeper/keypad.html
/home/httpd/cgi-bin/gatekeeper/locksmith.pl
/usr/local/.Admin/sethosts.pl
/usr/local/bin/suguard
</pre>


While you are analyzing the wonderful simplicity of this section,
note also the <b  >%doc</b> parameter. The file I include
here will automatically get installed under the /usr/doc hierarchy
on my system to represent the package. In this case, the directory
would be /usr/doc/gatekeeper-1.0 with one file (README) sitting
underneath it.
</p><p>Now comes the moment we have all been waiting for. Your .spec
file is complete, and you long to see this work. This is how you
build your package:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -bb gatekeeper-1.0-.spec
</pre><p>The <b  >-bb</b> option means &ldquo;build binary&rdquo;. The
rpm command has many flags that define whether you are building
source or binaries, or executing an individual section of the .spec
file. When you press <b  >ENTER</b> on the above command,
many things start scrolling past your eyes as RPM deals with every
section of your .spec file. The line I look for in this case is
<pre     class="programlisting">
Wrote: /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/gatekeeper-1.0-1.i386.rpm
</pre>


That, mes amis, is a beautiful thing.
</p><p>Throughout this article, I have referred to variables like
<b  >RPM_BULD_ROOT</b> without explaining where these
things come from. In the case of a Red Hat system like mine, this
is /usr/src/redhat where I find the following directories: BUILD,
RPMS, SOURCES, SPECS and SRPMS. If you are curious as to how they
are defined, have a look through the file /usr/lib/rpm/macros. If
you cannot find the &ldquo;macros&rdquo; file in this location (remember, rpm
must be loaded), use this command to locate it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -ql rpm | grep macros
</pre><p>You see, rpm is a wonderful tool for so many things,
including working with rpm itself.
</p><p>What? Ah, yes. I hear you, mes amis. You are asking,
&ldquo;Marcel, is there no other way to build an RPM, something perhaps
a little friendlier?&rdquo; Do not despair. Chef Marcel has a particular
fondness for that well-aged UNIX editor,
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span>. Nevertheless, there are other
ways to build an RPM package that bring the process to the desktop.
Allow me to show you these delicacies.</p><p>The first item I will mention is something from KLabs called
(strangely enough) <span   class="bold"><b>RPM Builder</b></span>
(see Figure 1). This is a Tcl/Tk application (written by
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Seek3r</em></span>) that automatically builds the
framework for a .spec file from a tar.gz distribution. Very neat,
despite the fact that our friends at KLabs built the screen based
on a 1024x768 screen. On my 800x600 screen, I lose part of it at
the bottom of my notebook. There is no need to tell them&mdash;they
already know about it. Still, it is worth checking out.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3974f1.large.jpg"><img src="3974f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. RPM Builder</p></div></div>
</p><p>Another package I would recommend is
<span   class="bold"><b>pkgbuild</b></span> (see Figure 2) from Davin
S. Hills of the Hills Design Group. This is a very nice-looking
package with a screen design that breaks the GUI into sections not
unlike the RPM-build process itself. You have a tab for the
preamble, one for &ldquo;Prep and Build&rdquo;, &ldquo;Install and Clean&rdquo; and so
on. Everything can be done from one interface. The software is
built on the FOX C++ development libraries written by Jeroen van
der Zijp, so you will need to pick that up if you want to build the
package yourself. RPMs of pkgbuild are available for Red Hat
users.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3974f2.large.jpg"><img src="3974f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. pkgbuild</p></div></div>
</p><p>Make sure you check out the RPM resources in the sidebar. For
more RPM masterpieces, I invite you to visit the official RPM web
site for all things RPM, and the RPM Documentation Project. The RPM
Documentation Project web site is in its infancy and somewhat
sparse. The maintainers promise much more information in the near
future, so by the time you read this, it may be
<span   class="emphasis"><em>brimming</em></span> with information. Check it out
anyhow. You will find a link to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Maximum
RPM</em></span> book by Edward C. Bailey, free and on-line. This
edition of the book is a couple of years old, but you will still
find lots of useful information.</p><p>Well, mes amis, that dreadful rooster outside is telling me
it is closing time. I sincerely hope I have managed to assist you
in bringing your brilliant Linux software package a little closer
to reality and a little closer to simple, reproducible
installations and updates. Au revoir, mes amis. Remember, you are
always welcome here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>. Bon
App&eacute;tit!</p><p><a href="3974s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
