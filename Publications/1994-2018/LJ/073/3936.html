    A look at how JPL scientists are using Linux to build better
    spacecraft and make accurate calculations.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2668580.0x27607c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Few technologies are more exacting than
that of designing and running space probes. A trajectory error as
small as one inch per mile, for instance, can result in missing the
target by tens of thousands of miles. Now add stringent budgetary
constraints, and you have some idea of the daily working
environment of the scientists and engineers at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratories (JPL) in Pasadena, California.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2668580.0x27608c8"></a>Linux at NASA</h2></div></div><p>With their long history of mainframe-based computing, NASA
scientists were quick to spot the benefits of Linux. The NASA
Goddard Space Flight Center, for example, uses Linux with its
airborne Scanning Radar Altimeter to study hurricanes. NASA's
Beowulf-class clustered computing project has also made use of
Linux for several years. Further, one NASA employee maintains a
site on the use of Linux for x-ray astronomers, and another is
harnessing it for the on-board navigational computers of space
probes. It's no surprise, therefore, that NASA's JPL is now
utilizing Linux in two very different projects: one to build better
spacecraft and the other to see that they arrive at the right
place.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2668580.0x27609d0"></a>Building Better Spacecraft</h2></div></div><p>When you are two billion miles from earth, you can't just pop
out to a hardware store to get a spare part. JPL's Advanced Thermal
and Structural Technology Group (ATSTG), therefore, is responsible
for ensuring all space probe components can withstand the rigors of
space travel. The ATSTG works on advanced technologies for thermal,
cryogenic and structural space systems including aerobots, rovers,
mechanical coolers and heat pipes. They have recently integrated
Linux into the business of building better spacecraft.</p><p>Thermal engineers play a key role in the design of space
hardware. &ldquo;Thermal engineering provides designs that maintain the
required temperatures at specific space hardware sites through the
range of all modes of operation and for the life of the hardware in
space,&rdquo; says Technical Group Leader Jose Rodriquez. &ldquo;Temperature
requirements for electronics, mechanisms, detectors and lasers are
critical to mission success.&rdquo;</p><p>The ATSTG uses a number of analysis tools to develop
analytical models to carry out design trade studies. The best,
cheapest and most complete integrated thermal analysis package
available is the Thermal Synthesis System (TSS). It allows thermal
engineers to create a thermal model of the hardware in a simulated
space environment. They can then achieve a better understanding of
how well the system will actually work when it is out in space. At
the time it was developed, the TSS graphical interface requirements
could be met with only high-end HP machines running UNIX. When the
ATSTG wanted a version for its own use, the only free versions of
the software available were for HP running UNIX or Linux on a PC.
Given the choice between spending many thousands of dollars to buy
or rent an HP, or spending $150 US to buy Red Hat Linux and
Accelerated X, they opted for the Linux version of TSS. The group
also installed Linux TSS on computers at two subcontractor
facilities.</p><p>TCP/IP is used to transmit data and models back and forth
between Linux and Windows computers. &ldquo;Because of the high expense
associated with the HP machines, it is necessary to keep them
utilized constantly to generate enough resources to pay for the
equipment,&rdquo; states Rodriquez. &ldquo;This is done by keeping as few
machines as possible, which means that engineers can't easily
access these computers during normal working hours and have to work
early or late hours to get the work done.&rdquo; Having Linux allows the
ATSTG members to run TSS right on their own PC whenever they need
it, eliminating costly downtime and enabling projects to be
completed sooner.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2668580.0x2760be0"></a>The Right Place at the Right Time</h2></div></div><p>Building a better spacecraft is fruitless, however, if it
never arrives at its intended destination. While some people have
trouble navigating their way across town, the scientists at JPL
have to plot a trajectory that will allow a space probe to
intercept a planet that is billions of miles away and traveling at
15,000 miles an hour. If you arrive a day late after a three-year
journey, you've missed the target by hundreds of thousands of
miles. As well as difficulties in hitting its space targets, there
are also budgetary targets that NASA personnel are expected to
meet. Linux is key to achieving both. &ldquo;Smaller projects (DS1, Mars
Pathfinder, etc.) are trying very hard to cut costs while achieving
all scientific goals,&rdquo; says Peter Breckheimer, Technical Group
Supervisor in the Navigation and Flight Mechanics Section of JPL's
Systems Division. &ldquo;Computers to run the navigation system have
been very expensive in the past due to the high level of
performance required.&rdquo;</p><p>Breckheimer's group has the responsibility of designing,
implementing delivering, and sustaining the Institutional
Navigation System Software (INSS) in all flight projects (Galileo,
Cassini, Mars, DS1, Stardust, etc.). Consisting of over 160
programs written primarily in Fortran 77 and C, Perl, Tcl/Tk and
HTML, INSS contains 4.5 million lines of source code. INSS is
designed to be readily portable to new platforms as they develop
(particularly Linux).</p><p>When JPL switched from mainframe to VAX in the eighties, it
required 15 man-years of software conversions. Later, for the move
to HP-UX, engineers used only standard features within the Fortran
77 and C compilers. As a result, portability issues are easy to
deal with. Going from HP-UX to Linux, therefore, took minimal work
and even tools like Perl and Tcl/Tk worked correctly the first
time. &ldquo;There are tools we have experimented with to convert
c-shell to NT scripts, but we haven't been successful yet,&rdquo;
reports Breckheimer. &ldquo;As for Linux, no conversion was necessary.
The scripts worked properly with no changes.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2668580.0x2760d98"></a>Benchmarking Linux</h2></div></div><p>Breckheimer has benchmarked a number of computers since 1984,
using a program called <span   class="bold"><b>nbodyf</b></span>.
This program takes an initial vector and integrates it with the
equations of motion for all planets in the solar system over a
five-year period. In 1984, a DEC VAX 11/780 took an hour and a half
to run the program. Now an HP J5000 can do the same thing in under
three seconds. While speed is important, the computer system must
also get the correct result. Therefore, the answer is tested using
a subset of INSS containing about 1 million lines of code. When run
on the benchmark tests, the $2500 PC running Linux compared very
favorably with results obtained on an HP 755 which cost over $30K.
Linux Red Hat version 5.0/5.1 was installed on a generic 200MHz PC
with 64MB RAM. It ran the nbodyf program in 14.5 seconds, versus
13.3 seconds for an HP 755/125 running HP-UX 9.07, and beat the
times for the HP J21, HP C110 and HP 755/99. On the other tests, it
ran as well or better than the 755/125. Later tests were run using
a 450MHz PC, and its performance improved roughly in proportion to
clock speed. &ldquo;An additional side benefit we observed was a slight
improvement in accuracy,&rdquo; says Breckheimer. &ldquo;The Fortran 77
compiler, obtained from Absoft, utilizes 80-bit registers for some
of the built-in functions used by our navigation software. On all
previously tested UNIX platforms, we were limited to 64-bit
arithmetic, so the Linux version of Absoft Fortran 77 offered some
definite improvement.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2668580.0x2760ef8"></a>The Future for Linux at JPL</h2></div></div><p>Year after year, Linux is gaining greater acceptance within
NASA. Given the huge investment that exists in older systems, it is
not likely that Linux will replace Windows or UNIX in the short
term, but Linux is working well where it has been used. &ldquo;Having
Linux's desktop functionality tremendously improves the engineers'
efficiency and speed,&rdquo; says Rodriquez. &ldquo;Projects greatly benefit
when engineers have readily available desktop analysis tools.&rdquo; His
one complaint, however, was the limited amount of peripheral
hardware that Linux supports. But with so many computer vendors now
offering Linux and the increasing number of Linux applications,
this situation is rapidly changing. Breckheimer, who has been
working with INSS through several platform incarnations, feels that
Linux &ldquo;opens up a significantly cheaper path to future computing
for many of the projects we support. While HP, Sun and SGI
workstations dominate our operations environment, Linux-based PCs
may make a significant impact soon. As more projects accept Linux,
computer costs for navigation systems will continue to decrease
significantly.&rdquo; So, while you don't have to be a rocket scientist
to appreciate the advantages of Linux, these days even rocket
scientists are beginning to adopt it as an alternative to
Windows.</p></div></div>
