    Debugging code is never fun, but this tool makes it a bit
    easier.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfa1580.0x1099660"></a></h2></div></div><p>Soon after C was born without function
prototyping, it was agreed that code debugging was an excessively
complex task. As a result, a very powerful tool,
<span   class="bold"><b>lint</b></span>, was created which was able
to make a large number of static verifications of the code. This
interesting program was written by S.C. Johnson in the early '70s,
and it was the first static code-validation tool.
</p><p>With the creation of the ANSI C standard, some lint
verifications became superfluous. However, lint continued to be
used while other tools were being created. John Guttag and Jim
Horning took a step forward by programming
<span   class="bold"><b>LCLint</b></span>. In a rough approximation,
it works the same way as lint, and lint's users will need very
little time to understand how to use it. However, with a bit of
work, we can improve the detail of analysis we received from lint
by using LCLint. Since its birth it has received the financial
support of ARPA, NSF and DEC ERP.</p><p>Today, the LClint source code is freely available. It was
written in C; therefore, anyone with a standard ANSI C compiler can
recompile it for their machine. Linux users can download it as a
tar archive file and as an RPM package. It is available in both
source and executable format. Some distributions, such as SuSE
Linux 5.3, currently provide it as part of the distribution. It can
be downloaded from
<a href="http://linuxdoc.org" target="_self">http://linuxdoc.org/</a>.</p><p>The original lint has far fewer commands than LCLint, and all
can be emulated using LCLint. That is why we can use LCLint to
replace lint. Much of the difference between lint and LCLint is
that lint's annotations are related to minimizing the number of
spurious messages, while LCLint's annotations have more features,
only some of which are used for this purpose.</p><p><a href="3599s1.html" target="_self">lint Commands</a></p><p>All lint commands are fully supported by LCLint, but we can
obtain a more accurate analysis using LCLint annotations. The
equivalencies between the most common annotations of lint and a
more accurate version of the commands are shown in the sidebar
&ldquo;lint Commands&rdquo;.</p><p>The basic idea of LCLint is to run it on our code before
compiling. <span   class="bold"><b>lint</b></span> will search for
many possible bugs in the program and return its findings. However,
the quantity of bug candidates, though larger than the
<b  >-Wall</b> option of
<span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span>, is still small because LCLint
makes an analysis of specified code, but does not know if that code
was written according to its semantics. As a result, we can use
LCLint in one of several forms. The first is to use it as a simple
static analyser of raw code. Although, in this mode, LCLint
recognizes many mistakes without a big-time investment in the
process, it is recommended only for debugging code written by other
programmers. This mode of analysis is not the best, because LCLint
does not know the semantics used when the code was written and
therefore it cannot discover if the program does whatever it
theoretically is supposed to do.</p><p>When we wish to use it on our own programs, we indicate the
semantics of our program through annotations which give LCLint more
information on the program functions. LCLint uses that information
for deducing whether the program does what we intended and not
something else. This form of using LCLint allows us to reduce the
debugging effort of large amounts of code with a minimal time
investment. I will discuss some annotations to demonstrate the use
of LCLint. For more information, read the manual.</p><p>A third analysis method is based on the specification of
abstract data types. We can specify interfaces, functions, types
and predicates using the pseudo-language LCL. LCLint will
automatically generate the corresponding header files to such
specifications and verify that the code agrees with these
specifications. However, although LCL is an algebraic-specification
language, LCLint will not prove theorems or properties, verify
correctness or completeness of the algebraic definition, or
generate code. It will generate headings and verify that the code
corresponds to the algebraic definition.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfa1580.0x1099c90"></a>Levels of Analysis Depth in LCLint</h2></div></div><p>LCLint is a versatile tool because it can do code analysis at
any level of abstraction we wish. LCLint has several levels of
analysis, corresponding to a greater or smaller quantity of
different checking techniques. These levels are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>weak</b></span>, which does
minimal monitoring. This level should be used only for C code
without annotations. LCLint static analysis could be used as a
first pass.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>standard</b></span> is the
default analysis. It does the same as
<span   class="bold"><b>weak</b></span> analysis, plus a bit more. It
needs a few annotations to be truly useful.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>checks</b></span> does all
the checks of <span   class="bold"><b>standard</b></span>, plus
complete monitoring of the function parameters and inconsistencies.
It is a good level for proving definitely that no statically
verifiable mistakes are present before using other software testing
techniques.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>strict</b></span> makes
absurdly strict checks. Should be used only if there is a very
subtle but annoying mistake, or if we are fanatics of strong-typed
and strong-structured languages. It includes checks such as if the
global variables specified within a function are usable in that
function (usable or not as marked by annotations), and checking of
types is quite strict. The programmers of LCLint assure me that
they will give a prize to anyone who writes a real program that
receives no warning when using LCLint in this mode.</p></li></ul></div><p>In addition to these generic analysis options, for each
possible check we have an option to enable one and disable another.
</p><p>We can gain the best use of LCLint using an incremental
approach. First of all, compiling the program using
<b  >Wall</b> can help us find the biggest errors; for
example, truly strange operations with pointers or arguments passed
to functions in the wrong way.</p><p>After this, we can begin with the weak analysis. If we use a
naming convention&mdash;strongly recommended&mdash;it is a good time to use
the flags to test that we used the right names and used variables
and macros in the right way. This is a deeper level of analysis
than we can do without annotations; if we used annotations, we can
get that kind of analysis.</p><p>The highest level of analysis commonly used is checks. If we
obtain only spurious analysis, it is time for dynamic debugging
techniques.</p><p>The strict level of analysis is good for pieces of code where
we cannot find an error that we know exists.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfa1580.0x109a4d0"></a>Annotations of LCLint</h2></div></div><p>All LClint annotations have a common syntax, which is</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/*@command@*/
</pre><p>All annotations are inserted within code in the same places
we can insert comments; thus, its presence in the code does not
affect normal compilation.
</p><p>The most frequent location of the annotations is near the
location of modifying semantics; e.g., in the definition of types,
if the annotations are going to affect that type.</p><p><a href="3599s2.html" target="_self">LCLint Annotations</a></p><p>LCLint has almost a hundred commands. Some of the most useful
ones are shown in the sidebar &ldquo;LCLint Annotations&rdquo;. We are not
activating or deactivating types of checks with these commands, but
enriching the code so that LCLint has information on the semantics
of the program and is able to do its analysis more
accurately.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfa1580.0x109a7e8"></a>Naming Conventions</h2></div></div><p>The use of naming conventions is a programming technique
which has many users, but also many detractors. LCLint does not
force you to use naming conventions, but it contains support for
some of them. Supported naming conventions are Slovak, Czech and
Czechoslovakian.</p><p><a href="3599s3.html" target="_self">Slovak-Naming
Convention</a></p><p>The rule of the Slovak-naming convention is that identifiers
are constructed with the scheme
<b  >abstracttypeVarname</b>. The abstract type and the
identifier name are separated with the first character of the
identifier name in upper case. The annotations of LCLint related to
the Slovak naming convention are shown in the sidebar. Remember
that a type's name must never have a capital letter when using the
Slovak-naming convention.</p><p><a href="3599s4.html" target="_self">Czech-Naming
Convention</a></p><p>The rule of the Czech-naming convention is that identifiers
are constructed with the scheme
<b  >abstracttype_varname</b>. The abstract type name and
the identificator name are separated by an underline character. The
modifiers related to Czech-naming convention are shown in the
sidebar. Remember that a type's name must never have an underline
character when using the Czech-naming convention.</p><p><a href="3599s5.html" target="_self">Czechoslovakian-Naming
Convention</a></p><p>The Czechoslovakian-naming convention is the same as using
Czech- and Slovak-naming convention at the same time. That is why
there are valid Czech and Slovak indentificators in the
Czechoslovakian-naming convention. The modifiers related to
Czechoslovakian naming convention are shown in the sidebar.
Remember that a type's name must never have an underline character
or a capital letter when using the Czechoslovakian-naming
convention.</p></div></div>
