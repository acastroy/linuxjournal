review (March). The current models do not have a console serial
mouse port, only a PS/2 port. They do have serial mouse ports for
connecting to the computers you wish to control, though.</p><p>I apologize for not catching the discrepancy between the
manual and the actual switch. That brings the error count in the
instruction manual up to two.</p><p>I realize the review has already been published, so maybe you
could run this in the Letters section of an upcoming issue.</p><p>&mdash;Ralph Krause rkrause@netperson.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea1580.0x1f993a0"></a>Painting the Town</h2></div></div><p>I'm still migrating my business, which involves lots of
letter and report writing, from NT to Linux, and so found the
February story &ldquo;LaTeX for Secretaries&rdquo; to be timely. Three things
I'd add for anyone contemplating LaTeX for day-to-day office chores
are:</p><p>One, Lyx is a front end for LaTeX that helped ease the
transition for me. I suspect a KDE-flavored version of Lyx, called
KLyx, might be good, too.</p><p>Two, <span   class="bold"><b>word2x</b></span> is a terrific
little program that converts MS Word documents into ASCII format.
Of course, all that formatting is lost in the process, but at least
you can get the content. I'm forced to use this far too often
because MS Word seems to dominate the non-Linux world.</p><p>Three, Leslie Lamport's ancient but still excellent book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LATEX: A Document Preparation System</em></span> (1994,
Addison Wesley Longman, Inc.) provides, as near as I can tell,
everything there is to know about LaTeX in a friendly
format.</p><p>&mdash;Mark Barnes mbarnes@pacifier.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea1580.0x1f996b8"></a>My Compliments</h2></div></div><p>Consistent technical accuracy and depth of information in the
<i  >Linux Journal</i> is a pleasure to see. I find the
depth of the articles and the resource sections better than any
book I have purchased on Linux. Of course, there is nothing like
reading the man page and /usr/doc/ files. The combination of my
subscription for the past three years and the database search on
<i  >Linux Journal</i> Interactive
(<a href="/" target="_self">/</a>) provides a
very convenient and efficient way of locating articles to implement
software solutions without having to sift through the table of
contents of each journal on my shelf. I just wish I had subscribed
earlier!</p><p>&mdash;Kevin Georgison keving@freenet.mb.ca</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea1580.0x1f99920"></a>Another Instant Messaging Client</h2></div></div><p>Your February 2000 issue had a small article about Jabber, an
open-source instant messaging system. While I don't want to start
our own instant messaging war, I would like to point out that
Everybuddy is another alternative. This
(<a href="http://www.everybuddy.com" target="_self">http://www.everybuddy.com/</a>)

You Decide</h2></div></div><p>Just wanted to let you know about an error in the February
issue. In the feature article, &ldquo;Gnome, Its State and Future&rdquo;,
there is an error on page 87. The paragraph entitled &ldquo;The AbiWord
Word Processor&rdquo; states that &ldquo;[you] can run the same word
processor across UNIX, Win32, BeOS and MacOS.&rdquo; This is not true.
According to the AbiSource web site, on the FAQ page, there is a
clear statement under the heading, &ldquo;Will it work on my
computer?&rdquo;: &ldquo;Currently, AbiWord does not work on a
Macintosh.&rdquo;</p><p>I'd appreciate a clarification in the next issue. I'd also
like to say that, although I'm new to Linux, your magazine is one
of the few that I read cover-to-cover every month.
Congratulations!</p><p>&mdash;Patrick Beart patrick@WebArchitecture.com</p><p>Here is the state of AbiWord for the Macintosh. About three
weeks ago, a group of four people got together, engaged in a flurry
of activity, and got AbiWord to compile on MacOS. Of course, you
cannot do anything with it except admire the created executable.
This was a tremendous step forward. Of course, now is when the hard
work begins.</p><p>&mdash;Robert Sievers bob@abisource.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea1580.0x1f99d40"></a>Letters in Issue 70</h2></div></div><p>Here are my responses to a couple of letters in the February
2000 issue:</p><p>Concerning &ldquo;Ads, Ads, Ads&rdquo; from Kyle E. Wright, I disagree.
I very much like to see the ads in your magazine. So long as you
are expanding the magazine and not trading the space with content
(which you confirmed), I think it's great. I like to know what's
available for my Linux system, and I usually see a product or two
each month that I'm interested in. I say, get as many ads as you
can&mdash;the more money you make, the better your magazine can
become.</p><p>Concerning &ldquo;Too Much Red Hat?&rdquo; from Can Bican, I also
disagree. Red Hat is the leader, and as such has more news, more
goings-on, etc. I don't mind hearing about them and I certainly
don't mind making money in the stock market on Linux companies.
Keep the news coming.</p><p>&mdash;John Dawson jdawson@tcainternet.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea1580.0x1f99f50"></a>We're Getting Better</h2></div></div><p>You've just ensured my continued subscription.</p><p>Thanks for picking up Stan Kelly-Bootle. When I subscribed to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX Review</em></span>, Stan's column was the icing on
the cake; later, during <span   class="emphasis"><em>UR's</em></span> migration to
&ldquo;Performance Computing&rdquo;, I found Stan's column was the only thing
I was reading in that periodical. Now, I'm happy&mdash;no, ecstatic&mdash;to
see that Stan is contributing to <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>The content of Stan's first <i  >LJ</i> column
seems a little &ldquo;dumbed down&rdquo;; perhaps Linux users aren't as
educated or sophisticated as UNIX users. Regardless of motives or
machinations, I'm very glad to see Stan in one of my favorite
magazines again.</p><p>&mdash;Sean Russell ser@efn.org</p><p>Maybe Stan was just getting his feet wet with that first
article &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea1580.0x1f9a318"></a>Proprietary Software As God</h2></div></div><p>I do not agree with your magazine's apparent worship of every
proprietary software package released for Linux. It is good that
Linux is growing in popularity, but you miss the point.
Particularly in the February 2000 article in the Forum called
&ldquo;Matlab&mdash;A Tool for Doing Numerics&rdquo;, you disappointed me greatly.
GNU Octave is a great program that is a replacement for the
proprietary Matlab. It is version 2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>, so it
has been around a while and works. It can even import Matlab files.
The Octave developers deserve our support and thanks for giving of
themselves. The Matlab creators do not.</p><p>&mdash;Pat Mahoney pat13@gmx.de</p><p>In the July 1997 issue, we ran an article entitled &ldquo;Octave:
A Free, High-Level Language for Mathematics&rdquo; by Malcolm Murphy. We
have presented many articles on free software and how to develop
it. Our column &ldquo;Focus on Software&rdquo; is devoted to free software.
If you think we worship proprietary software, you obviously haven't
read any of Jason Kroll's articles. Creators of both free and
proprietary software for Linux deserve our support &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea1580.0x1f9a528"></a>How Many Daemons...</h2></div></div><p>In response to Jason Schumaker's article &ldquo;The Wide World of
Linux&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/5381.html" target="_self">/article/5381</a>),
there were only three daemon women and only
<span   class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> of them in latex, a custom outfit of her
own choosing. She was a volunteer; the other two women were
actresses from a local agency and wore normal red jeans and
blouses. All three women enjoyed themselves immensely and expressed
great interest in doing this again (it was the volunteer's second
appearance; she also did this at COMDEX). Funny how it's always the
uninvolved making value judgments about what's sexist and what's
not&mdash;yet another common defect in human nature. :)</p><p>Anyway, since Jason felt compelled to rip on our booth, I
figured the least he could do would be to rip on it accurately.
Here's some photographic evidence which may also jog his memory for
those all-important details:
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/~jkh/lw2000/daemonbabes.jpg" target="_self">www.freebsd.org/~jkh/lw2000/daemonbabes.jpg</a>
and
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/~jkh/lw2000/daemonbabe.jpg" target="_self">www.freebsd.org/~jkh/lw2000/daemonbabe.jpg</a>.
</p><p>&mdash;Jordan Hubbard jkh@FreeBSD.org</p><p>I had intended to write something more here, but I must say
the names of your jpg files say it all&mdash;daemonbabes, indeed! And
what's up with bsdchicks.com? It is true that the uninvolved are
often the ones making the value judgements, and that is usually
true because the involved don't recognize the sexism in their own
actions.  &mdash;Marjorie Richardson, Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea1580.0x1f9a898"></a>The D&aelig;moness Herself</h2></div></div><p>As one of the BSD girls, the only one in latex, and the one
who <span   class="emphasis"><em>uses</em></span> the OS and was there as a volunteer,
I believe Jason Schumaker (&ldquo;Going for the Gold&rdquo;,
<a href="../000/5164.html" target="_self">/article/5164</a>)
wins the hypocrisy award for assuming none of us were doing this on
our own volition, or knew anything about BSD or Linux. ;) And, hey.
Coffee substitute and FAQ-answering roles included, it was a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>great</em></span> show. And I'll include my congrats and a
&ldquo;great job&rdquo; to Elthia, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>woman</em></span> in the
dustpuppy outfit.</p><p> &mdash;Cerene@uclink4.berkeley.edu</p><p>For many years, I was a programmer in the oil industry and
attended many SEG (Society for Exploration Geophysicists)
conventions. At the first ones I attended, most of the booths had
pretty women dressed sexily in much the same manner as the
d&aelig;mon &ldquo;girls&rdquo;. These women were actresses who were hired
for their looks and charm to attract the many men in the industry
to the particular booth they worked at. I was offended that women
were being used as sex objects and that men were considered stupid
enough to fall for such tactics. All these women were happy to have
jobs and seemed to be having a good time&mdash;this attitude does not
change the inherent sexism of the situation. The conventions did
not change until enough women became a part of the oil industry to
have their voices heard.</p><p>BSD's motives may be pure&mdash;Mr. Hubbard's letter certainly
seems to indicate he feels they are. But looking at the pictures on
his site certainly reminds me of the bad old days in the oil
industry, and the time and effort women put into changing this sort
of attitude. Perhaps using a d&aelig;mon guy would help, and
costumes not so tight and low-cut.</p><p>Jason Schumaker made neither of the assumptions you say he
did. I congratulate him for being sensitive to this issue and
willing to say so publicly. Congratulations to you on knowing and
using BSD! Perhaps when you start thinking of yourself as a woman
instead of a girl, you will understand the difference between the
d&aelig;mon costumes and that of the dustpuppy.</p><p>&mdash;Marjorie Richardson, Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea1580.0x1f9acb8"></a>Revisiting the ORB</h2></div></div><p>The Castlewood Orb removable disk drive was reviewed in
<i  >LJ</i>'s December issue. I was intrigued, despite
the reported slow speed; I figured there must be a faster SCSI
model. In fact, they no longer make the parallel port version you
reviewed. It's available as external SCSI or USB, or internal SCSI
or ATAPI. I purchased an external SCSI model and I can report the
following: I measured write speed at over 3000KB/sec, and
<span   class="bold"><b>hdparm</b></span> reports reading speed at
8.3MB/sec. Being SCSI, it is trivial to create a Linux-native file
system on it and mount it. All and all, I'm very satisfied with my
Orb 2.2.</p><p>&mdash;Peter S.
