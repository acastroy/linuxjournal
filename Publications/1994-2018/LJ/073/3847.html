system administration similar to the classic &ldquo;UNIX System
Administration Handbook&rdquo; by Nemeth et al., except with particular
emphasis on Linux? Was it network administration dealing with hubs,
switches, bridges, routers, etc.? What was on the CD-ROM, and how
did it apply to administration?</p><p>After reading this book, I'm not sure I know any answers. In
fact, I think the best feature of the book is that several times
the author refers to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux for Dummies, 2nd
Edition</em></span> to find basic information. The book lacks
organization, the highlighted examples often have the wrong fonts
for the computer/user dialog, and sections often contain
contradictory paragraphs. In general, the writing style is
obnoxious.</p><p>It would appear that the author either never heard of (or
never used) the commands <span   class="bold"><b>more</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>less</b></span> except in the MS-DOS piping
sense. In a few instances, despite admonishing the reader not to
change anything in the file they want to view (as part of the
example), he encourages using vi to view, despite warning that it
may be tricky to use. It is just too easy for the beginner to err
when using vi as root on a live system.</p><p>The book is concerned about users on a &ldquo;Linux system&rdquo;, but
doesn't say <span   class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> they may be there. Nothing
about, for example, Cyclades multi-port cards to allow multiple
simultaneous users, or even the suggestion that family members take
turns at the single-seat console. Just how is the na&lt;\#239&gt;ve
user with a desktop computer going to know what is meant by a
&ldquo;Linux terminal&rdquo;? Though he does mention dual-boot on one page,
it is more to confuse the reader than to explain it. He was correct
in stating that one can dual-boot via LILO; he missed the
opportunity to suggest that, in addition, one could boot from a
floppy disk, via loadlin from MS-DOS, from a CD-ROM, etc.</p><p>So from the limited discussion, I guess the reader must
assume one is attached to the Ethernet for multiple users. The
discussion of Ethernet cabling is lacking, in particular there is
no mention of a hub when describing 10-BaseT. The author leads the
reader to assume that <span   class="bold"><b>ping</b></span> stops
automatically, but on Red Hat Linux 5.2 or 6, one enters
<b  >CTRL-C</b> after a reasonable time to get ping
statistics about network connections.</p><p>Chapters 8 and 9 offer simple introductions to the basic
protocols: TCP and UDP, and Internet addresses, masks and services.
However, the explanation and example of subnets is wrong.</p><p>Chapter 11 considers UUCP and FTP quite superficially. That
is not a problem with UUCP, because few people use it these days.
But, when discussing setting up an anonymous FTP server, the author
lists what purports to be a step-by-step method. Unfortunately, he
doesn't describe what should be in /ftp/bin nor whether an /ftp/lib
directory is needed. Why would technical book authors not try out
their examples?</p><p>A whole chapter (12) was devoted to SLIP, but then the author
claims it has basically been superceded by PPP, which is treated in
a too-brief chapter (13). The chapters in Part V on Network File
and Machine Sharing appear to have been written about five years
ago, particularly those on NFS, NIS, and DNS.</p><p>Chapter 18, on printing, seems somewhat useful. I will note
that if one wants to print on a printer on an Apple network, it is
not always necessary to do so through Netatalk. Newer Apple
Macintosh Laserwriters can be assigned their own IP numbers and
names and can be accessed by following the instructions in the
manual for printing from a networked UNIX machine.</p><p>Part VI, Electronic Mail, News and Web Browsing, is brief but
somewhat better than most of the other parts. I was surprised that
the author didn't suggest creating a message file to someone, using
vi, and then giving the command &ldquo;mail someone@domain &lt;
message&rdquo;. I guess he had never used the &ldquo;mail&rdquo; program when it
was the only choice before such programs as Elm, Pine, and Netscape
were written. I agree with his choice of Pine for e-mail and Usenet
news, and Netscape for web browsing.</p><p>Part VII, Network Security, is mostly just buzzwords. For
example, let me quote a couple of sentences. &ldquo;TCFS, the
Transparent Cryptographic File System, is a newer version of CFS
with greater capabilities. Its chief advantage is that TCFS is user
transparent, which is the same attribute that makes CFS so easy to
use and administer.&rdquo; OK, this tells us that it is newer, but what
are the &ldquo;greater capabilities&rdquo;? The accompanying CD-ROM dataplate
contains such programs as Tripwire, Mon, Sudo, etc., but newer
versions or better replacement tools can be downloaded.</p><p>Part VIII, Linux Disasters and Recovery Techniques, has a few
commonsense ideas. One is to make regular backups. Others are to
keep a good set of Linux reference material around, read Linux
newsgroups, and make friends with other administrators.</p><p>Part IX is the &ldquo;for Dummies&rdquo; Part and lists some utilities,
tools and web sites. Since the author seemed so inept through most
of this book, I have no reason to think his personal ratings and
recommendations are useful. I will note that I do think this part
was written more recently than many other chapters in his
book.</p><p>Overall, I think the bulk of this book was a reworked version
of a UNIX system administration book from roughly five years ago.
For someone who has never been previously exposed to system
administration or network administration, looking up buzzwords from
this book on a web browser might actually be helpful. Anyone who
set up their Linux box following <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux for Dummies, 2nd
Edition</em></span>, or <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux for the Compleat
Idiot</em></span>, or <span   class="emphasis"><em>The No BS Guide to Linux</em></span>
will probably be disappointed if they move on to this book. I don't
understand how two reviewers on Amazon.com could give this book
four stars out of five. I'd give it one star out of five, at
best.</p></div></div>
