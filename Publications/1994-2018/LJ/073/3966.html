client's system and noticed the /usr/src directory filled with
every 2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> kernel ever released. When I asked
the administrator about it, he responded he always keeps up with
each new stable release just in case there are any security-related
problems with the old one. (Okay, I'll buy that.) When I asked him
why he didn't just download the patches and apply them, he said he
didn't know what to do with them. I'm finding system administrators
aren't the only ones who don't understand the patch process, as
I've sent instructions to a couple of maintainers of very large
packages who didn't supply patches.
</p><p>Those of you with small disks or slow Internet connections
can appreciate the problem of downloading 16MB files each time
there's a 2KB change. While I'm sure many of you don't notice the
impact on the Internet, it's there. Imagine 10% of the folks
running Linux (over one million users, if you believe the latest
figure of 10 million plus users) wanting to upgrade at the same
time. The 2.2.14.tar.bz2 is over 12MB. A patch file from 2.2.13 to
2.2.14 is 1.4MB. That's nearly an order of magnitude difference,
and that is significant in both disk space and bandwidth. This
amount of traffic would swamp the kernel.org servers as well as
several major routers. If you start with new pristine sources each
time you compile, you have to go through and recreate your kernel
configuration (<b  >make [menu|x]config</b>). If you
patch up, that rather lengthy step is not needed. Using patch files
saves everyone time, so save some bandwidth and patch the
code.</p><p>mcdl:
<a href="http://rsd.dyn.mil.wi.us/~rsd/code/mcdl" target="_self">http://rsd.dyn.mil.wi.us/~rsd/code/mcdl/</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>mcdl</b></span> provides a fast, easy
way to catalog your CD collection automatically, using a MySQL
database. The lookup is performed once over the Internet to CDDB
sites. A GUI interface is planned for access/lookups/manual input
of data. This is just the back end, but those of you who can use an
SQL server (or an SQL monitor like
<span   class="bold"><b>xmysql</b></span>) should find this useful.
It requires the MySQL server, Perl, Net::CDDB module, discid, DBI
and MySQL modules.</p><p>disc-cover:
<a href="http://www.liacs.nl/~jvhemert/disc-cover" target="_self">http://www.liacs.nl/~jvhemert/disc-cover/</a></p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>disc-cover</b></span> utility will
create a print file to print a CD cover for a jewel case. You can
include an image file for use on the front cover. It uses a
connection to a CDDB site to get the information for the song
titles, but a manual mode is available. It can also print extended
information, but you need to control the quantity of extended
information manually or the layout will be destroyed. It requires
the MySQL server, Perl and the FreeDB module.</p><p>cpuid:
<a href="http://people.qualcomm.com/karn/code/cpuid" target="_self">http://people.qualcomm.com/karn/code/cpuid/</a></p><p>Do you have any systems sitting around in which you're not
sure what they have? Maybe you want to compile in support for
<span   class="bold"><b>mtrr</b></span>, but only on systems that
support it. This little utility will tell you all that and more. If
you have more than a few systems around from different
manufacturers or different models from one manufacturer, this
utility will probably come in handy. It requires glibc.</p><p>fdupes:
<a href="http://netdial.caribe.net/~adrian2/programs/fdupes-1.1.tar.gz" target="_self">netdial.caribe.net/~adrian2/programs/fdupes-1.1.tar.gz</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>fdupes</b></span> is a program to find
and remove duplicate files in the directory provided on the command
line (required). You must have write access to the specified
directory. It requires glibc.</p><p>quotenotifier:
<a href="http://www.bogus.net/~torh" target="_self">http://www.bogus.net/~torh/</a></p><p>This Perl script can be run from
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> or the command line, and will
provide the current price of a stock or alert you when the stock
goes above or below thresholds passed to the program. You'll need
to know the stock's ticker symbol, since no search facility comes
with the script. It requires Perl, the Getopt::Long, LWP::Simple
and Mail::Sendmail modules and recommends cron.</p><p>freq:
<a href="http://www.bangmoney.org/projects/freq" target="_self">http://www.bangmoney.org/projects/freq/</a></p><p>This utility reads the lastlog and displays numbers of logins
for all users. This is modifiable in several ways. You can include
FTP users with shell account users, if you wish. A good
informational tool. It requires Perl.</p><p>fphdb:
<a href="http://www.lehigh.edu/~ajr4/fphdb" target="_self">http://www.lehigh.edu/~ajr4/fphdb/</a></p><p>This is a very polished, professional order and estimation
program for a printing company. Customer, Product, Paper, Shipping,
Order and Job Manager screens access a MySQL database. It requires
a web server with PHP support, MySQL and a web browser.</p><p>phpLanParty:
<a href="http://lanparty.hypermart.net" target="_self">http://lanparty.hypermart.net/</a></p><p>Want to host a few rounds of Quake? Or another networked game
you'd like to invite friends to play? Well
<span   class="bold"><b>phpLanParty</b></span> will let you announce
these games in advance, and players can sign up for them. Makes
hosting network games easy. It requires a web server with PHP
support, MySQL and a web browser.</p><p>GNU Pilot LogBook Pro:
<a href="ftp://ftp.stampede.org/skibum" target="_self">ftp://ftp.stampede.org/skibum/</a></p><p>This pilot logbook is designed after the Professional Pilot
Logbook with which most pilots will be familiar. What you don't
need to do is worry about the totals. This is well-laid-out and has
a &ldquo;Remarks and Endorsements&rdquo; box, allowing you to enter as much
data as you want&mdash;unlike the actual book, which is very limiting.
Medical information isn't implemented yet, but should be added
soon. It requires libgtk, libgdk, libgmodule, libglib, libdl,
libXext, libX11, libm, glibc, pilot's license and airplane (last
two optional).</p></div></div>
