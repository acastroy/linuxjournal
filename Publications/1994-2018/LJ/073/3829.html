    Analyzing performance is one of the most important tasks of
    a system administrator; here's how to do it using Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18f4580.0x19ec7c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>As recent Linux history has shown
(Mindcraft, anyone?), performance is not only good publicity, it's
important. Yet current means of measuring performance offer only
global statistics about the whole system or very precise data about
an isolated application. Moreover, these often fail in helping the
programmer or the system administrator to isolate a performance
bottleneck resulting from the interaction of complex
internetworking applications, which are more and more common. The
Linux Trace Toolkit (LTT) addresses these issues and provides users
with a unique view of the system's behavior with minimal
performance overhead (&lt; 2.5%).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18f4580.0x19ec8c8"></a>LTT's Architecture</h2></div></div><p>In order to be extendable and accomplish its task without
hindering system performance, LTT is designed to be as modular as
possible. In fact, it would be wrong to call it a &ldquo;tool&rdquo; since it
is composed of many pieces that, grouped together, fulfill the
desired function. This toolkit is implemented in four parts. First,
there is a Linux kernel that enables events to be logged. Second, a
Linux kernel module takes care of storing the events into its
buffer and then signals the trace daemon when it reaches a certain
threshold. The latter then reads the data from the module, which is
visible from user space as a character device. Last, but certainly
not least, the data decoder takes the raw trace data and puts it in
a human-readable format while performing some basic and more
advanced analysis. This decoder, as will be discussed further,
serves as the toolkit's graphic and command-line front end.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18f4580.0x19ec9d0"></a>Installing LTT</h2></div></div><p>The LTT tar.gz archive can be found at

usages, but the tools can be summoned directly without any script.
</p><p>To install LTT, simply follow the instructions that come with
the LTT package. The first and hardest step is patching the kernel.
Once this is done, configure the kernel and compile it. Note that
there is an option for compiling with or without the tracing code.
When compiled without, the resulting kernel operates as if you
hadn't applied any patch to it. Next, compile the trace daemon and
the trace toolkit graphic front end and put them in your favorite
directory (/usr/bin or /usr/local/bin for example). Reboot with the
LTT patched kernel, and you're ready to go.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18f4580.0x19ed528"></a>Sample Tracing Session</h2></div></div><p>To demonstrate the toolkit's operation, we traced 10 seconds'
worth of system operation. During those 10 seconds, two commands
were issued: <span   class="bold"><b>dir</b></span> on a directory
not accessed since system boot (i.e., not present in the dcache)
and <span   class="bold"><b>bzip2</b></span> on a 10MB file. The
system was booted in single-user mode (in order to have as few
applications running as possible, and therefore isolate the
operation of the observed applications) using the modified kernel.
Note that no events are recorded by the kernel module until the
trace daemon has issued the <span   class="bold"><b>start</b></span>
command to it using the <span   class="bold"><b>ioctl</b></span>
system call. The following command was issued to start the
tracing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
trace 10 out140
</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>trace</b></span> is a script that takes
two arguments: the number of seconds the trace should last and the
base name for the output file. Two files are produced: out140.trace
and out140.proc. The former holds the data recorded by the kernel
module, and the latter, the content of /proc when the trace
started. Using these two files, we know what the system looked like
before we started tracing it and what happened during the trace.
Hence, we can reconstruct the system's behavior.
</p><p>Note that the trace daemon accepts many command-line options
used to configure the kernel trace module. For instance, one can
specify the events to be traced and the desired level of details.
One can also specify whether CPU IDs should be recorded for SMP
machines. Since LTT fetches the calling address for system calls,
you can specify at which calling depth this address should be
fetched or which address range it is a part of.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18f4580.0x19ed8f0"></a>Viewing the Result of the Trace Session</h2></div></div><p>This is the most interesting part about LTT and what
differentiates it from other tools. Even though the current example
is rather simplistic, more elaborate traces can be generated and
analyzed just as easily. To view the trace in the graphical front
end, simply type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
traceview out140
</pre><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>traceview</b></span> script accepts
one argument: the base name of the generated trace. It then
executes the trace toolkit front end, passing it the out140.trace
and out140.proc files. Note that the front end can be invoked
manually and can be used as a command-line tool as well. In the
latter case, it can be used to dump the contents of trace in a
human-readable format or perform a detailed trace analysis. The
complete options are described in the documentation included with
LTT.
</p><p>A sample display of the front end can be seen in Figure 1. As
usual, there is a menu, a toolbar and the data. To present the
data, the tool uses three thumbnails. The first, Event Graph,
presents the events in a graphical way. On the left, a list of all
processes that existed during the trace is presented. On the right,
a scrollable graph displays the transitions that marked the time
frame being displayed. A vertical transition means the flow of
control has been passed to another entity. The color of the
vertical line used for the transitions indicates the type of event
that caused the transition. Blue is for a system call, grey for a
trap and white for an interrupt. Horizontal lines indicate the time
spent executing code belongs to the entity in the process list at
the same height. A green line is for application code and an orange
line is for kernel code.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3829f1.large.jpg"><img src="3829f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. LTT Front End</p></div></div>
</p><p>In Figure 1, we can see that
<span   class="bold"><b>sh</b></span> was running and a page fault
occurred. Control was transfered to the kernel, which did some
operations and then gave control back to sh. The latter executed
for a while, then did a <span   class="bold"><b>wait4</b></span>
system call. This, in turn, gave control back to the kernel. After
a couple of operations, the kernel decided to do a task switch and
handed control to process 152, bzip2. While bzip2 was running,
another trap occurred. Toward the end of the trace, we can see
bzip2 made a system call to
<span   class="bold"><b>getpid</b></span>, and on returning,
continued executing.</p><p>Figure 2 presents a more interesting case. For illustration
purposes, the trace portion was zoomed out; some icons overlap, but
the meaning is fairly straightforward. Here, bzip2 tries to read
something, but the kernel doesn't find it. bzip2 starts waiting for
I/O (input/output) and the kernel schedules the idle task. Two
milliseconds later, the hard disk sends an interrupt to signal that
it finished reading (that's the icon with a chip and an exclamation
mark with a 14 beside it, 14 being the IDE disk IRQ).
<span   class="bold"><b>bzip2</b></span> is then rescheduled, stops
waiting for I/O and returns to its normal execution. Here, we can
see exactly how much time bzip2 spent waiting for I/O and the exact
chronology of events that led to it losing CPU control and
regaining it. When trying to comprehend complex interactions
between tasks, this type of information can make all the
difference.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3829f2.large.jpg"><img src="3829f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Event Graph</p></div></div>
</p><p>Giving a different perspective, the second thumbnail, Process
Analysis, provides us with an in-depth analysis of each process
that existed during the trace and a global analysis of the system.
Figure 3 presents a sample of this analysis. On the left, the
process tree is presented. At the top of the tree lies the idle
task (PID 0) which is presented as being <span   class="emphasis"><em>The All
Mighty</em></span>. Since the idle task never does anything worth
tracing, it is used to present data about the whole system: trace
start time, trace end time, duration, time spent idle (idle was
scheduled as running). Then the number of occurrences of key events
is presented. Notice some events given here can't be accounted for
by using the information in /proc.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3829f3.large.jpg"><img src="3829f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. Process Analysis</p></div></div>
</p><p><a href="3829l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>When selecting dir and bzip2 processes, the information in
Listing 1 is displayed. Notice the difference in percentages
between the time running (time scheduled by the kernel as having
control over the CPU) and the time spent actually executing code
belonging to the application. In bzip2's case, the gap is very
small, which accurately describes bzip2's behavior as
CPU-intensive; whereas in dir's case, less than half of the time it
was scheduled was spent executing its own code, the rest being
spent in kernel routines.</p><p>Note also the differences between the time spent waiting for
I/O and the time running. <span   class="bold"><b>dir</b></span>
spent more time waiting for I/O than it spent executing.
<span   class="bold"><b>bzip2</b></span>, on the other hand, spent
little time waiting for I/O compared to the time it spent in
running state. This information wasn't collected using sampling on
the system clock, as is done currently for the information
available through /proc. This information is calculated using the
trace information and is therefore the exact information regarding
the observed task.</p><p>Last but not least, the third thumbnail presents the raw
trace. Figure 4 presents a portion of a raw trace. The events are
presented in chronological order of occurrence. For each event, the
following information is given: the CPU-ID of the processor on
which it occurred, the event type, the exact time of occurrence
(down to the microsecond), the PID of the task to which it belongs,
the size of the entry in the kernel module that was taken in order
to record the event in full and the description of the event.
Notice how the address from which a system call was made is
displayed. This could eventually be used to correlate with data
recorded from within the application or simply to know which part
of the code made the call. Unlike other tracing methods such as
<span   class="bold"><b>ptrace</b></span>, there is no effect on the
application's behavior, except the minimal event-data collection
delays.</p><p>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18f4580.0x1de6b68"></a>LTT's Future</h2></div></div><p>As this article has shown, LTT is an effective tool for
recording critical system information. Moreover, it is rather
simple to use and the information presented is accessible to a
large portion of the community. In an academic environment, LTT can
be used in a course on operating systems, helping students get
first hand experience with a live operating system and how it
interacts with different applications.</p><p>Given its capabilities, modularity, extensibility and minimal
overhead, we hope to see the tracing code become part of the
mainstream Linux kernel soon (maybe not in 2.3/2.4 currently in
feature freeze, but in the next development branch). Another
possible application for LTT, which gathered a lot of interest, is
to use it as part of a security auditing system with Tripwire-type
capabilities. At the time of this writing, the authors know of at
least one Linux distribution which plans to include LTT as part of
their standard distribution.</p></div></div>
