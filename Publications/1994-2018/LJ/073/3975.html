uses the box as an Internet server. The problem is that the person
I have taken over for left without providing the root password for
the box. Is there any way I can find the password, or any way I can
recreate it without knowing the original password?  &mdash;Rusty Mays,
rmays@ntr.net
</p><p>When you get the LILO prompt, press the tab key. Find which
kernel name is first (probably &ldquo;linux&rdquo;) and type</p><pre     class="programlisting">
linux init=/bin/bash
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Once you get a prompt, do the following:</em></span>
<pre     class="programlisting">
mount -wno remount /
/bin/vi /etc/passwd
</pre>


<span   class="emphasis"><em>The old trick was to remove the password field (anything
between the 1st and the 2nd colon), but some distributions (notably
Red Hat) have a bug (or feature, depending on how you look at it)
where it won't let you log in as root if there is no password, and
also the password command will not work if the password field is
blank. The </em></span><span   class="bold"><b>passwd</b></span>
command should work and let you enter a new password even if you
don't know the old one (and leave it in place). If that fails,
another option is to replace the encrypted password with a known
encrypted one, like yours.  &mdash;Marc Merlin, marc_bts@valinux.com
</p><p>The passwords used in UNIX/Linux are usually hard to crack,
so the best thing to do is to boot from a Linux boot floppy, then
edit the password file. Boot from a set of Linux boot floppies,
either for an installation or one of the &ldquo;Linux on a floppy&rdquo;
installations from
<a href="http://www.toms.net/rb" target="_self">http://www.toms.net/rb/</a>.
After booting from the floppy, mount the hard disc, then make a
copy of the password file, just in case (either /etc/passwd or
/etc/shadow), then edit the password file (with vi, pico, etc., or
use sed and/or cut) to remove the password for root. Finally,
unmount the hard disk and reboot, then log in as root and set the
root password immediately. It's probably a good idea to check for
other accounts with a UID of 0, and accounts you do not
recognize.  &mdash;Keith Trollope, kt57707@GlaxoWellcome.co.uk</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ab580.0x23a3500"></a>I Can't Get No Resolution</h2></div></div><p>My machine at home has a sis6215 chip, and Red Hat 6.0
doesn't have a driver for it. Probably because of this, when Gnome
runs, the screen is zoomed and everything is huge. The default
resolution is some 320x200. I tried to configure custom settings
through Xconfigurator and also X11Config, but the resolution didn't
change. Where am I stuck? Is there some problem with my monitor

<a href="http://www.xfree86.org/3.3.6/SiS2.html#2" target="_self">www.xfree86.org/3.3.6/SiS2.html#2</a>,
your chip isn't supported by XFree86. You can still try XFree86
3.3.6, but there aren't many chances it will work. If your chip is
VESA 2-compliant, you have another option: use the VesaFB frame

function, I get a &ldquo;modem busy&rdquo; response. This also happens if I
use dialup. I use COM3 for my modem, so I set Linux to tty2. I
think this is correct. Is it conflicting with Windows? Any
suggestions?  &mdash;Don Hoornaert, richey@mb.sympatico.ca
</p><p>Even though many things could be happening (misconfigured
port settings, broken modem, misconfigured software, etc.), make
sure you have all settings correct and try connecting directly to
the modem with
<b  >cu&nbsp;-l&nbsp;/dev/tty<i><tt>ofyourmodem</tt></i></b>.
The &ldquo;<b  >ttyofyourmodem</b>&rdquo; depends on which COM port
you use; it could be ttyS0, ttyS1, ttyS2 or ttyS3 for COM1, COM2,
COM3 or COM4, respectively. If you succeed in connecting to the
modem this way and get an OK in response to an
<span   class="bold"><b>AT</b></span> command, then you are okay. If
you bought your computer with Windows pre-installed, it is probable
that you have what is called a Winmodem, which is a crippled kind
of modem for Windows only. If that is the case, you had better buy
a modem that works with Linux. I have bought many 3COM USRobotics
&ldquo;Python&rdquo; internal modem cards that provide 56K V.90
data/fax/voice services to my Linux servers with excellent results.
Check this excellent web page for modem compatibilities:
<a href="http://www.o2.net/~gromitkc/winmodem.html" target="_self">www.o2.net/~gromitkc/winmodem.html</a>.
Check the entire modem list table. There are some people trying to
make Winmodems work with Linux, but to play safe, buy a new
Linux-compatible one.  &mdash;Felipe E. Barousse,

installation of the second CD-ROM which is an HP 9200i CD_RW,
everything mounted okay. Now, when I issue the
<span   class="bold"><b>mount</b></span> command
(<b  >mount&nbsp;/mnt/cdrom</b>), I get the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

bad option, bad superblock on /dev/cdrom or too many file systems

</pre><p>Both are SCSI drives. Please help if you can.  &mdash;Tom
Mcloughlin, tommcl@pacbell.net
</p><p>There are two likely reasons for this problem. Either your
&ldquo;second&rdquo; CD-ROM is seen as &ldquo;first&rdquo;, or the devices are
configured to use the same SCSI ID, thus preventing any of them
from functioning. Please check how SCSI identifiers have been
assigned to the drivers and remember that the smaller ID is
considered &ldquo;first&rdquo; drive (/dev/sr0) and the bigger ID is
considered &ldquo;second&rdquo; (/dev/sr1).  &mdash;Alessandro Rubini,
rubini@linux.it</p><p>/dev/cdrom is a symbolic link to a device like /dev/scd0 (the
first SCSI CD-ROM). The second SCSI CD-ROM will be /dev/scd1. So,
when wanting to mount the second CD-ROM, issue the command
<b  >mount&nbsp;/dev/scd1&nbsp;/mnt/cdrom</b>, or create
new links like /dev/cdrom0 to /dev/scd0 and /dev/cdrom1 to
/dev/scd1. Don't forget to update the /etc/fstab, because mount
<b  >/mnt/cdrom</b> will read the fstab and mount the
device allocated to this mounting point.  &mdash;Paulo J V Wollny,

Intel 440Bx system: NT4/Windows 98/Linux. While I can print
absolutely fine from Windows 98 and NT4 on my HP 670C printer, I
cannot do so from Linux. The error I get is &ldquo;printer port is not
recognised&rdquo;. I have tried using the
<span   class="bold"><b>printtool</b></span> to force the HP 670C on
lp0, lp1 and lp2, respectively, but to no avail. What could be the
problem? I have even tried changing the BIOS setting between ECP
and EPP.  &mdash;Sunil Dhaka, dax@net4india.com
</p><p>Are your printers parallel? If so, you might not have the
parallel printer port driver configured correctly. Sometimes with
Red Hat, the parallel port is not set up correctly after the
installation. Add this line to the /etc/conf.modules file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
alias parport_lowlevel parport_pc
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Reinitialize your machine, and your parallel port
should now work fine. Configure everything with the printtool
utility and send a test page to print.  &mdash;Felipe E. Barousse,
fbarousse@piensa.com</em></span>
</p><p>A local user I know, Scott Hettel, recently solved this
problem on his own system. He found that Red Hat 6.1 does not
support the IBM PC parallel printer port by default. The answer for
this is on Red Hat's web site. See bug numbers 5698 and 5821 on
their site for the resolution to this problem. You may also want to
look at bug 8969, which discusses port compatibility. Please note
that these issues affect only version 6.1 of Red Hat.  &mdash;Chad

with a serial port attached to a modem. The port is /dev/ttyS1. The
line I put in /etc/inittab is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
S1:2345:respawn:/sbin/mgetty ttyS1

</pre>


Shortly after the system came up after reboot, I received this
message continuously at about five-minute intervals:
<pre     class="programlisting">
INIT: Id "S1" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes.

</pre>


Any ideas as to what I'm doing wrong? I'm running Red Hat
6.0.  &mdash;Chris Yeats, CYeats@limbach.com
</p><p>The message you get means that Linux starts the mgetty
process and for some reason it dies, gets restarted and dies again.
The most probable cause is that your modem cable does not have the
correct pin wiring to work. Check
<a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Text-Terminal-HOWTO-17.html#fast_respawn" target="_self">www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Text-Terminal-HOWTO-17.html#fast_respawn</a>
to find out a bit more about the problem. To override the cable
problem (but losing modem control features), use the
<b  >-r</b> option for mgetty, which makes mgetty not
monitor and detect the missing pin signals on your cable. I would
still buy a good modem cable, though.  &mdash;Felipe E. Barousse,
fbarousse@piensa.com</p><p>Your mgetty ttyS1 command exits immediately and init disables
its further invocation. You should first make the command work from
the command line, where you can check what its error messages are
and whether it works as expected. You should put the command in
inittab only after your problems (misconfiguration, I suppose) are
fixed.  &mdash;Alessandro Rubini, rubini@linux.it</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ab580.0x23a4478"></a>Sound Support</h2></div></div><p>I use a Compaq Presario which came with an ESS sound chip,
but I would like to use SB Vibra 128 instead. The problem is I
cannot disable the ESS chip because there aren't any jumpers. Also,
it's not possible to disable from BIOS menu. Is there any way to
make my new sound card work under Linux? It seems as if both sound
cards want to use the same resources. I am using Slackware version
7.0.  &mdash;Chumpon Thamwiwat, thchum@rocketmail.com</p><p>Having no way to change settings of the ESS sound chip, maybe
you can change the settings on the Vibra hardware. The driver
configuration parameters may be of help also; many times, the
driver indicates to the hardware which IRQ and address the device
should use. If you do not load the driver for the ESS, then the ESS
won't be activated, therefore you could load the driver for the
Vibra, assuming there is no conflict of hardware settings and each
board has its own drivers.  &mdash;Felipe E. Barousse,
