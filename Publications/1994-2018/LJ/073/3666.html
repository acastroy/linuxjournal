concepts in building a graphical user interface in X and Motif.
I'll go into a quick introduction to the X Window System and its
programming model, then introduce Motif and illustrate some
concepts with a sample program. Finally, we'll go through the basic
Motif programming principles.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc29580.0xd21710"></a>X History</h2></div></div><p>The X Window System, or simply X, was originally developed at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with support from Digital
Equipment Corporation. X was developed for Project Athena to
fulfill the project's need for a distributed, hardware-independent
user interface platform.</p><p>X is a graphics system used primarily on UNIX systems. It
provides an inherently client/server-oriented framework for
displaying windowed graphics. It provides a way of writing
device-independent graphical and windowing software that can be
ported easily from one machine to another.</p><p>X provides functionality via a vast set of subroutine
libraries. These may be called from a variety of high-level
languages. However, they are most easily called from C
programs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc29580.0xd218c8"></a>Clients and Servers Concept</h2></div></div><p>Since X is network-oriented, the applications developed for
it do not need to run on the same system as the one supporting the
display. The programmer doesn't need to worry much about the
practicality of this, as X normally makes this transparent to the
user.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc29580.0xd219d0"></a>The Server</h2></div></div><p>The server is the program that controls the display. It acts
as a bridge between user programs (i.e., clients or applications)
and the resources of the local system. These run on either local or
remote systems. The server performs the following duties:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Allows access by multiple clients.</p></li><li><p>Interprets network messages from clients.</p></li><li><p>Allows two-dimensional graphics display.</p></li><li><p>Maintains local resources such as windows, cursors,
fonts and graphics.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc29580.0xd21df0"></a>The Client (or Application Program)</h2></div></div><p>The client in X usually consists of two parts. One, the
graphical user interface, which is written in one or more of Xlib,
Xt or Motif. Two, the algorithmic or functional part of the
application where the input is received from the interface and
processing tasks are defined.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc29580.0xd21ef8"></a>The Programming Model</h2></div></div><p>In this section, I will briefly describe the main tasks of
the three levels of the X/Motif programming model. The X/Motif
programming model consists of Xlib, Xt Intrinsics and Motif.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3666f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. User Interface Library Model
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc29580.0xd221b8"></a>Xlib</h2></div></div><p>Xlib handles the interface between the client application and
the network. It is part of the X software architecture. The main
task of Xlib is to translate C data structures and procedures into
the special form of X protocol messages, which are then sent off.
The converse, receiving messages and converting them to C
structures, is performed by Xlib as well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc29580.0xd222c0"></a>Xt Intrinsics</h2></div></div><p>X Toolkit Intrinsics (Xt Intrinsics) is a toolkit that allows
programmers to create and use widgets. Toolkits, such as the Xt
Intrinsics, implement a set of user interface features or
application environments such as menus, buttons or scroll bars
(referred to as widgets). Since Motif is built upon Xt, we'll need
to call some Xt functions. However, we do not need to understand
the workings of Xt, as Motif takes care of most things for
us.</p><p>The client and server are connected by a communication path
called the connector. This is performed by a low-level C language
interface known as Xlib. It is true that many applications can be
written solely using Xlib, but in general, it will be difficult and
time-consuming to write complex GUI programs only in Xlib. Many
higher-level subroutine libraries, called toolkits, have been
developed to remedy this problem. One of these toolkits is
Motif.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc29580.0xd22420"></a>The Motif Toolkit</h2></div></div><p>Motif is a widely accepted set of user interface guidelines
developed by the Open Software Foundation and its member companies
around 1989, and supported since. These rules specify how an X
Window System application should &ldquo;look and feel&rdquo;. Motif includes
the Motif Toolkit (Xm), which enforces a policy on top of the X
Toolkit Intrinsics (Xt). Xt is really a &ldquo;mechanism, not policy&rdquo;
layer, and Xm provides the specific look and feel. For example, Xt
does not insist that windows have titlebars or menus, but it
provides hooks for developers of specific toolkits (Motif,
OpenLook, Athena widgets) to take advantage of. Motif also includes
the Motif Style Guide document which details how a Motif user
interface should look and behave to be &ldquo;Motif compliant&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc29580.0xd22528"></a>The Relation Between Xlib and Motif</h2></div></div><p>As illustrated in Figure 1, the application may interact with
all layers of the windowing system, the operating system and other
libraries as needed. On the other hand, the user interface portion
of the application should restrict itself to the Motif, Xt and Xlib
libraries whenever possible.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc29580.0xd22630"></a>Motif Widgets</h2></div></div><p>The widget is the basic building block for the Graphical User
Interface (GUI). It is common and beneficial for most GUIs
assembled in Motif to look and behave in a similar fashion. Each
widget in Motif is provided by default actions. Motif also
prescribes certain other actions that should, whenever possible, be
adhered to. Information regarding Motif GUI design is provided in
the Motif Style Guide.</p><p>Each widget is defined to be of a certain class. All widgets
of that class inherit the same set of resources and callback
functions. Motif also defines a whole hierarchy of widget classes.
There are two broad Motif widget classes that concern us. The
Primitive widget class contains actual GUI components, such as
buttons and text widgets. The Manager widget class defines widgets
that hold other widgets.</p><p>A Motif widget may be regarded as a general abstraction for
user-interface components. Motif provides widgets for almost every
common GUI component, including buttons, menus and scroll bars.
Motif also provides widgets whose only function is to control the
layout of other widgets, enabling fairly advanced GUIs to be easily
designed and assembled.</p><p>Widgets are designed to operate independently of the
application except through well-defined interactions, known as
callback functions. This takes much of the mundane GUI control and
maintenance away from the application programmer. Widgets know how
to redraw and highlight themselves and how to respond to certain
events such as a mouse click. Some widgets go further than this;
the Text widget, for example, is a fully functional text editor
with built-in cut and paste as well as other common text-editing
facilities.</p><p>Widgets are very useful because they simplify the X
programming process and help preserve the look and feel of the
application so it is easier to use.</p><p>The Motif Reference Manual provides definitions on all
aspects of widget behavior and interaction. Basically, each widget
is defined as a C data structure whose elements define a widget's
data attributes, or resources and pointers to functions, such as
callbacks.</p><p>The general behavior of each widget is defined as part of the
Motif (Xm) library. In fact, Xt defines certain base classes of
widgets which form a common foundation for nearly all Xt-based
widget sets. Motif provides a widget set, the Xm library, which
defines a complete set of widget classes for most GUI requirements
on top of Xt.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc29580.0xd22948"></a>&ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo; Motif Program</h2></div></div><p>The helloworld.c program explains the steps to follow in
writing Motif programs.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>helloworld.c</b></span> creates a
window with a single pushbutton in it. The button contains the
string &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo;. When the button is pressed, a string
(Hello to you too!) is printed to standard output. This program
illustrates a simple interface between the Motif GUI and the
application code.</p><p>The program also runs forever! This is a key feature of
event-driven processing. For now, we will have to quit our programs
using the operating system:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Use <b  >CTRL</b>-c to quit from the
command line.</p></li><li><p>Use the Window Menu &ldquo;quit&rdquo; option.</p></li><li><p>Depress right mouse button down around the top
perimeter of the window, and choose the &ldquo;quit&rdquo; option from
menu.</p></li></ul></div><p>The complete program listing for the helloworld.c program is
in Listing 1. The display of helloworld.c on screen will look like
Figure 2.

Motif, Xt and Xlib libraries. The compile command I used for
helloworld.c is</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gcc helloworld.c -o helloworld -lXm -lXt
-lXext\
-lICE -lSM -lX11
</pre><p>Note that this compile line is required in my environment. It
may be different in yours. You should check your local system
documentation for the exact compilation directives.
</p><p>Having successfully compiled your Motif program, the
command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 ./helloworld &amp;
</pre><p>will run it and display the PushButton on the screen as shown
in Figure 2.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc29580.0xd19c28"></a>Function Calling Conventions</h2></div></div><p>When writing a Motif program, you will be calling upon Motif
and Xt functions and data structures explicitly. In order to
distinguish the various toolkits, X adopts the following
convention:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Motif function and data structure names begin with
Xm, such as <span   class="bold"><b>XmStringCreateSimple</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>XmStringFree</b></span>.</p></li><li><p>Xt Intrinsics functions and most data structures
begin with Xt, such as
<span   class="bold"><b>XtVaAppInitialize</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>XtVaCreateManagedWidget</b></span>. The
widget data structure is an exception to this rule.</p></li><li><p>Xlib functions and most data structures begin with
X. There are no Xlib functions used in helloworld.c. However, an
example of an Xlib function call is
<span   class="bold"><b>XDrawString</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>XDrawLine</b></span>.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc29580.0xd1a1a8"></a>Header Files</h2></div></div><p>Any application that uses the Motif toolkit must include a
header file for each widget it uses. Every Motif widget has its own
header file, so we have to include the Xm/PushB.h file for the
pushbutton widget, the Xm/DrawingA.h for the drawing widget and so
on. However, we do not have to explicitly include the Xt header
file, since Xm/Xm.h does this automatically. Every Motif program
will include Xm/Xm.h, the general header for the motif
library.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc29580.0xd1a2b0"></a>Basic Motif Programming Principles</h2></div></div><p>We'll now analyze the helloworld.c program in detail. There
are six basic steps that nearly all Motif programs have to follow.
These are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Initializing the toolkit</p></li><li><p>Widget creation</p></li><li><p>Managing widgets</p></li><li><p>Setting up events and callback functions</p></li><li><p>Displaying the widget hierarchy</p></li><li><p>Entering the main event-handling loop</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc29580.0xd1a830"></a>Initializing the Toolkit</h2></div></div><p>The first step in a Motif program is to initialize the Xt
Intrinsics toolkit. Before an application creates any widget, it
must initialize the toolkit. There are several ways to initialize
the toolkit. The most common is XtVaAppInitialize. When the
XtVaAppInitialize function is called, the following tasks are
performed:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The application is connected to the X
display.</p></li><li><p>The command line is parsed for the standard X
command-line arguments.</p></li><li><p>Resources are created using the app-default file,
if any.</p></li><li><p>The top-level window is created.</p></li></ul></div><p>XtVaAppInitialize takes several arguments.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>The Application context</b></span>: the
first argument to XtVaAppInitialize is the address of an
application context, which is a structure that Xt uses to manage
some internal data associated with an application. For the Motif
program we are considering, we need not know anything about this
except that we need to set it in our program.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Application class name</b></span>: the
second argument is a string which defines the class name of the
application. It is used to reference and set resources common to
the application or even to a collection of applications.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Command-line arguments</b></span>: the
third and fourth arguments specify a list of objects as special X
command-line arguments. The third argument is the list and the
fourth, the number in the list. This is advanced X use and will not
be considered further in this article. Just set the third argument
to <b  >NULL</b> and the fourth to <b  >0</b>.
The fifth and sixth arguments, <b  >&amp;argc</b> and
<b  >argv</b>, contain the values of any command-line
arguments given. These arguments may be used to receive
command-line input of data in standard C fashion (e.g., file names
for the program to read). Note that the command line may be used to
set certain resources in X. However, these will have been removed
from the <b  >argv</b> list if they have been correctly
parsed and acted upon before being passed on to the remainder of
the program.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Fallback resources</b></span> provide
security against errors in other setting mechanisms. They are
ignored if resources are set by any other means (i.e., using the
app-default file). A fallback resource is a
<b  >NULL</b>-terminated list of strings. For now, we
will simply set it to <b  >NULL</b> since no fallback
resources have been specified.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Additional parameters</b></span>: the
eighth parameter is the start of a
<b  >NULL</b>-terminated list of resource,value pairs
that are applied to the top-level widget returned by
XtVaAppInitialize. For now, it's a
<b  >NULL</b>-terminated list since there is no resource
setting.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc29580.0xd1b330"></a>Creating and Managing Widgets</h2></div></div><p>Creating a widget is referred to as instantiating it. You ask
the toolkit for an instance of a particular widget class, which can
be customized by setting its resources. A widget in Motif can be
created by using a specific function for creating each widget or by
using convenience functions for generic widget creation and even by
creating and managing widgets with a single function call to
<span   class="bold"><b>XtVaCreateManagedWidget</b></span>.</p><p>In general, we create a widget using the function
<span   class="bold"><b>XmCreate</b></span><span   class="emphasis"><em>widgetname</em></span>.
To create a pushbutton widget, we use
<span   class="bold"><b>XmCreatePushButton</b></span>. Similarly, to
create a menu bar, we use
<span   class="bold"><b>XmCreateMenuBar</b></span>.</p><p>Most XmCreate<span   class="emphasis"><em>widgetname</em></span> functions take
four arguments:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The parent widget (topWidget in
helloworld.c)</p></li><li><p>The name of the created widget, a string (&ldquo;Hello
World! Push me&rdquo; in helloworld.c)</p></li><li><p>Command line/resource list (NULL in
helloworld.c)</p></li><li><p>The number of arguments in the list</p></li></ol></div><p>The argument list can be used to set widget resources such as
the widget's initial height and width.
</p><p>Once a widget is created, it must be managed.
<span   class="bold"><b>XtManageChild</b></span> is a function that
performs this task. A widget's parent manages the child's size and
location, determines whether the child is visible, and may also
control input to the child.</p><p>When this happens, all aspects of the widget are placed under
the control of its parent. The most important aspect of this is
that if a widget is left unmanaged, it will remain invisible even
when the parent is displayed. This provides a mechanism with which
we can control the visibility of a widget. Note that if a parent
widget is not managed, a child widget will remain invisible even if
the child is managed.</p><p>However, one function actually creates and manages a widget.
This function is called XtVaCreateManagedWidget, which can be used
to create and manage any widget.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc29580.0x102de98"></a>Principles of Event Handling</h2></div></div><p>An event is defined to be any mouse action (such as clicking
on a button or a menu bar option) or keyboard action such as
pressing <b  >ENTER</b> or any input device action. The
effects of an event are numerous, and include window resizing,
window repositioning and invoking functions available from the
GUI.</p><p>When a widget is created, it will automatically respond to
certain internal events, such as a window manager's request to
change size or color and changing its appearance when pressed. This
is because Xt and Motif frees the application program from the
burden of having to intercept and process most of these events.
However, in order to be useful to the application programmer, a
widget must be easily attached to application functions. Widgets
must be hooked up to application functions via callback
resources.</p><p>X handles events asynchronously. It basically takes a
continuous stream of events and then dispatches them to
applications, which then take appropriate actions.</p><p>If you write programs in Xlib, there are many low-level
functions available for handling events. Xt, however, simplifies
the event-handling task, since widgets are capable of handling many
events for us, such as automatic redraw and response to mouse
presses.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc29580.0x102e100"></a>Translation Tables</h2></div></div><p>The functionality of a widget encompasses its behavior in
response to user events. Each widget defines a table of events,
called the translation table, to which it responds. The translation
table maps each event, or sequence of events, to one or more
actions. Full details of each widget's response can be found in the
Motif Reference material.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc29580.0x102e208"></a>Adding Callbacks</h2></div></div><p>Translations and actions allow a widget class to define
associations between events and widget functions. For any
application program, Motif will provide only the GUI. The main body
of the application will be attached to the GUI and functions called
from various events within the GUI.</p><p>To do this in Motif, we have to add our own callback
functions. In helloworld.c, we have a function
<span   class="bold"><b>pushButton</b></span> which prints to the
standard output.</p><p>The function <span   class="bold"><b>XtAddCallback</b></span>
is the most commonly used function to attach a function to a
widget. XtAddCallback has four arguments:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The widget in which the callback is to be installed
(button in helloworld.c).</p></li><li><p>The name of the callback resource. In our example,
we set XmNactivateCallback.</p></li><li><p>The pointer to the function to be called.</p></li><li><p>Client data may get passed to the callback
function. Here, we do not pass any data; it is set to
<b  >NULL</b>.</p></li></ol></div><p>In addition to performing a job like highlighting the widget,
each event action can also call a program function.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc29580.0x102e838"></a>Declaring Callback Functions</h2></div></div><p>Callback functions have the following format:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
void functionNameCallback (Widget w, XtPointer
client_data, XmPushButtonCallbackStruct *cbs)
</pre><p>The callback function parameters are:
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The first parameter of the function is the widget
associated with the function (button in our case).</p></li><li><p>The second parameter is used to pass client data to
the function. It is not used in our sample program.</p></li><li><p>The third parameter is a pointer to a structure
that contains data specific to the particular widget that called
the function and information on the event that triggered the call.
The structure we have used is a
<span   class="bold"><b>XmPushButtonCallbackStruct</b></span>, since
we are using the PushButton Widget.</p></li></ol></div>

There are two final actions every Motif program must perform.
First, it must tell X to display or realize the widgets. This is
achieved via the <span   class="bold"><b>XtRealizeWidget</b></span>
function; realizing the widget creates the actual window for the
widget. In helloworld.c, we pass the top-level widget,
<span   class="bold"><b>topWidget</b></span>, to the function so that
all child widgets are displayed. Second, the Motif program enters
the main event-handling loop; the call to
<span   class="bold"><b>XtAppMainLoop</b></span> turns control of the
application over to the X Toolkit Intrinsics. Xt handles the
dispatching of events to the appropriate widgets, which in turn
pass them to the application via callbacks.
