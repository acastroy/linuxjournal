    When you want to take a quick look at a graphics file, XV is
    the application to use.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d90580.0x1e88558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Most of the graphics printed in this
magazine come to us electronically, and the first way we look at
them is with <span   class="bold"><b>xv</b></span>, an interactive
viewer for the X Window System. This program was written by John
Bradley and has many pages of documentation. The man page tells you
only the name of the documentation file, namely xvdocs.ps; you have
to find out where it was installed (perhaps /usr/local/lib/). The
program is quite simple and intuitive to use, and you can figure
out its basic uses whether you read the manual or not.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>xv</b></span> will display just about
any type of graphics file you happen to have: GIF, JPEG, TIFF, PBM,
PGM, PPM, X11 bitmap, BMP and many more. It will even display
PostScript by calling up Ghostview to help it out. It is available
by anonymous download at
<a href="ftp://ftp.cis.upenn.edu/pub/xv" target="_self">ftp://ftp.cis.upenn.edu/pub/xv/</a>
and has a home page at
<a href="http://www.trilon.com/xv" target="_self">http://www.trilon.com/xv/</a>.
<span   class="bold"><b>xv</b></span> is a shareware program that is
free for personal use. There is a $25 US registration fee, and site
licenses are available.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3964f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Main Window</p></div></div>
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3964f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Control Window</p></div></div>
</p><p>Typing <b  >xv</b> alone at the command-line prompt
brings up a window containing the xv title page with bright red
fish swimming through the air (see Figure 1). Clicking the right
mouse button in the window brings up the control window (see Figure
2), while pressing the letter <b  >q</b> quits the
program.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3964f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. Justin</p></div></div>
</p><p>To load a picture, click on &ldquo;Load&rdquo;, and a window will come
up showing the contents of the current directory. Double-click the
image file you want to view, and that image replaces the red fish
in the main window. Alternatively, you can type the file name on
the command line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xv 3964f3.jpg
</pre><p>This command displays the picture of my youngest grandchild,
Justin, shown in Figure 3. Wild cards are recognized, so typing
<b  >xv&nbsp;*.gif</b> will load every GIF file in the
current directory, displaying one after another each time you press
the space bar.
</p><p>Looking at Figure 2 again, you'll see that there is a double
row of buttons across the top of the control window. Clicking on
any of these buttons causes a menu to drop down, showing various
options. Options not available will be grayed out. For example, if
I click on &ldquo;Display&rdquo; while viewing Justin's picture, I am given
the options of &ldquo;raw&rdquo; and &ldquo;smooth&rdquo;, but &ldquo;dithered&rdquo; is grayed
out. Also, &ldquo;Use standard colormap&rdquo; is checked and all other
options are grayed out.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3964f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. Image Info Window</p></div></div>
</p><p>In the menu obtained by clicking on &ldquo;Windows&rdquo;, you will
find &ldquo;About XV&rdquo;, which you tells you about registration fees, and
&ldquo;XV Keyboard Help&rdquo;, which tells you how the program will react to
certain key and mouse presses. The most useful options in this
window are &ldquo;Color Editor&rdquo; and &ldquo;Image Info&rdquo;, the latter in
particular. I use the Info option for every image I display to
determine if the picture is high enough resolution to print well.
The image information for Justin's picture is shown in Figure 4.
Looking at this information, we see that the image is in JPEG
format and has a resolution of 339x418. This will give us a picture
that would print reasonably well as an author photo. It's a bit
grainy at the larger size we are showing here. Any smaller, and our
Associate Editor Darcy Whitman would be writing for a new picture.
The resolution is also shown toward the bottom of the control
window.</p><p>The menus for &ldquo;Image Size&rdquo; and &ldquo;24/8 Bit&rdquo; are fairly
self-explanatory. Image size is nice in that it gives you many
choices for resizing the picture, including setting it yourself or
as a function of percentages of current size or pixels. The
&ldquo;Root&rdquo; menu I leave alone&mdash;the name is enough to deter me from
using it. The &ldquo;Algorithms&rdquo; menu can provide some fun, although
not as much as you might have with programs such as the GIMP.
Figure 5 shows an embossed image of Justin, while Figure 6 is a
pixelized version. The oil painting option was not pretty&mdash;it
looked like sections had been scraped off with a knife.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3964f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5. Embossed Image</p></div></div>
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3964f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 6. Pixelized Image</p></div></div>
</p><p>The buttons down the right side of the control window will
allow you to &ldquo;Save&rdquo;, &ldquo;Print&rdquo; or &ldquo;Delete&rdquo;, as well as load
images. Delete will let you delete from the viewing list, or from
the list and the disk both.</p><p>Rows of buttons along the bottom allow you to rotate the
image 90 degrees (right or left) or turn it upside down, if you
wish. Play with them&mdash;it's fun for a minute or two. The &ldquo;A&rdquo;
button gives you the ability to annotate the picture as I did for
Figure 3, which can be quite useful in remembering when a photo was
taken. I use the &ldquo;Crop&rdquo; button quite often; in fact, this picture
of Justin is cropped from one in which I was holding him (see
Figure 7). Clicking and holding down the left mouse button as you
drag it in the window draws a frame which defines the area to be
cropped.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3964f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 7. Uncropped Picture</p></div></div>
</p><p>I also use the &ldquo;Grab&rdquo; button quite frequently in order to
make screen shots. Click on this button, set a delay time (e.g., 1
second), click on &ldquo;Autograb&rdquo;, put your cursor in any window, and
that window will appear in XV's main window. Or you can use
&ldquo;Grab&rdquo; and define the area you wish to view by holding down and
dragging the left mouse button.</p><p>XV is truly a useful program and one that I use on a daily
basis. Try it; I think you'll like it.</p></div></div>
