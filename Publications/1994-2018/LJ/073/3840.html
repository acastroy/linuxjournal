Overoptimistically, Sun's marketing department presents Java as
revolutionary, because a person can write code on one operating
system and have it run on many others. Performance fanatics
ridicule Java, because no Java program can match the speed of
optimized C code. Both of those points of view are flawed&mdash;the
marketers are wrong to claim that a revolutionary level of &ldquo;write
once, run anywhere&rdquo; has been achieved, and the speed freaks ignore
the fact that Java's performance is &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; for many tasks.
In my view, Java is a well-designed, modern systems programming
language which did not try to integrate well with others or be a
performance leader. It's a fine language for writing medium to
large, fairly static systems, especially if interoperability with
Java libraries is desired and interoperability with non-Java
&ldquo;legacy&rdquo; code is not needed. Under those conditions, all that's
missing is a good scripting solution which allows the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>users</em></span> to control the applications. And that's
just what Jim Hugunin did when he rewrote the Python interpreter in
Java and called it JPython.
</p><p>That's right: JPython is a completely new implementation in
Java of what Guido van Rossum did in C&mdash;7 years later and using a
very different language. It's the same thing, and yet altogether
different. I will describe what JPython is, how it works, and what
it will let you do which &ldquo;the original Python&rdquo; can't. If you have
any need for a scripting language which can interact with Java
libraries such as the Swing GUI toolkit, you may find that JPython
fills a significant gap. But first, a little history.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13b3580.0x14ab4a8"></a>History</h2></div></div><p>In 1990, Guido van Rossum chose a portable, well-established
language to write his first version of Python. That language was C.
Guido cares deeply about portability, and as a result, Python runs
on just about anything with a C compiler. (I should know&mdash;I claim
to be the first person to have run Python on both a Windows CE
handheld and a Cray supercomputer.) History validated this choice;
while C++ was available at the time, it was still immature. By
1997, Python had achieved all the portability Guido thought was
reasonable&mdash;and then Java came along and upset everything. For a
variety of reasons, the Java platform was designed to operate in a
language vacuum&mdash;as a result, the interfaces between Java and other
languages such as C and C++ are cumbersome. Furthermore, any Java
system made to talk to &ldquo;native&rdquo; code using the Java Native
Interface (JNI) loses several important features of a pure Java
program, such as portability and security guarantees. Thus, Python
couldn't, as written, run on the &ldquo;Java Platform&rdquo;.</p><p>There were three possible ways of solving that problem. The
first, to have Python talk to Java via the JNI, was attempted by a
few teams, but didn't provide a complete solution and did not allow
the development of a 100% Java solution. A second alternative
considered was to convert Python virtual machine bytecodes to Java
virtual machine bytecodes. While this sounds simple in theory, it
wasn't practical. Python's bytecodes are very high level and
manipulate complex objects, while Java's bytecodes are more akin to
assembly language. The third approach was the &ldquo;right&rdquo; one, but it
was also the most ambitious: to convert Python source files
directly to Java bytecodes. Because of Python's dynamic nature,
this meant re-implementing the Python parser and interpreter in
Java. Luckily for us, Jim Hugunin, a longtime fan of Python and the
main author of the Numeric Python extensions, undertook that
project.</p><p>Soon, Jim Hugunin was so engrossed with JPython that he quit
his Ph.D. work at MIT and went to work full-time for the
Corporation for National Research Initiatives. There he joined
Guido and other Python hackers to finish JPython. Jim released
JPython 1.0 in July 1998 and started work on JPython 1.1, a major
revision. Jim's success with JPython led to an offer he couldn't
resist from Xerox PARC (the folks who invented the laser printer,
the mouse, the desktop metaphor, Ethernet, etc.), and in mid-1999,
Jim was off to Palo Alto to work on other Java-related projects.
Luckily for the rest of us, Barry Warsaw, another of Guido's
esteemed colleagues, took over the maintenance and development of
JPython. As of this writing, Barry remains the current
&ldquo;flag-bearer&rdquo; for JPython. If you're itching to install JPython
at this point, see the &ldquo;Installation Issues&rdquo; sidebar.</p><p><a href="3840s1.html" target="_self">Installation Issues</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13b3580.0x14ab710"></a>What is JPython?</h2></div></div><p>JPython is a Python interpreter and compiler written in and
for Java. The fact that JPython is an
<span   class="emphasis"><em>interpreter</em></span> means you can type
<b  >jpython</b> at a command-line shell and get the
familiar <b  >&gt;&gt;&gt;</b> prompt. As we will see,
most Python code written for CPython (what the original Python
implementation is called when contrasted with JPython) runs fine in
JPython. The fact that JPython is a Python compiler for Java means
you can take a Python program and <span   class="emphasis"><em>compile</em></span> it
to Java .class files, which in turn can be used by other Java
programs in myriad ways. Finally, the fact that it is written in
and for Java means JPython allows the Python programmer absolutely
seamless access to any and all Java libraries, and that is, as
we'll see, its &ldquo;killer feature&rdquo;.</p><p>As a teaser, consider the program calc.py, shown in Listing
1.</p><p><a href="3840l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3840f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Screenshot of the Calculator Example in Action
</p></div></div><p>A few things are worth noting about this program, which I
adapted from one written by Guido van Rossum. If you're a Java
programmer, you may notice that calc.py is a useful program which
doesn't define a single class. This is one of the ways in which
Python (here JPython) provides a simple scripting solution, whereas
Java requires the programmer to know about classes, inheritance,
public vs. private members, etc. The second aspect of calc.py,
which Java programmers might notice, is that the code is more
compact than the equivalent Java code, and yet its purpose remains
clear. This is one of Python's most valued strengths, and JPython
builds on it in several ways. Python programmers will probably
first notice they can read the code and it &ldquo;feels&rdquo; like good old
Python; and second, the parts of the code they don't immediately
understand refer to objects like JPanel, BorderLayout, JTextField,
etc. These are defined in Java's Swing GUI. We won't describe Swing
in detail here, but see the Swing sidebar for some discussion on
what Python programmers should know about Swing.</p><p><a href="3840s2.html" target="_self">Swing</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13b3580.0x14abd40"></a>How Does JPython Work?</h2></div></div><p>The average JPython user won't care one iota how it works, as
long as it does. If you're curious, however, knowing how a tool
works is a necessary step toward knowing how to use it well. At the
highest level of analysis, JPython takes Python scripts (.py files)
and compiles them to Java Virtual Machine (JVM) bytecodes, which in
turn are executed by the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Using a
program called <span   class="bold"><b>jpythonc</b></span>, one can
even take Python scripts and compile them to .class files, which
are then usable as beans, applets or servlets, or in any other
system where compiled Java code can be used.</p><p>A more useful description of how JPython works is based on
the object model it uses. In CPython, Python objects are divided
into two kinds of types: built-in types, such as integers, strings,
file objects, etc., and instance and class objects. Furthermore,
every instance is linked to a class object via a
<b  >__class__</b> attribute, and class objects can be
linked to base classes via the <b  >__bases__</b> tuple
attribute.</p><p>In JPython, all Python objects are instances of a Java class.
Thus, the number 42 is an instance of the Java class
<span   class="bold"><b>PyInteger</b></span>, which is accessible
through its <b  >__class__</b> attribute. Furthermore,
all objects which the JPython user can manipulate are instances of
a class which derives from a common base class, PyObject. If these
relationships aren't clear, don't worry; the details are almost
never needed. What's important is what this design means: all
Python objects (including number, string, instance and class
objects) are Java objects. Two consequences follow. First, any Java
code which can process a Java Object can process a JPython object.
Second, all memory management in JPython is done by the normal Java
mechanisms, i.e., by the garbage collector implemented in the
runtime environment.</p><p>What does this mean for the Python user? It means that,
unlike in CPython, you don't have to worry about creating cyclic
references which CPython's reference-counting garbage collector
won't reclaim&mdash;in Java, those will be reclaimed. That's the good
news. The bad news is the programmer no longer has complete control
over when garbage collection occurs. For example, code which relies
on file objects being closed when the references to them go out of
scope, such as</p><pre     class="programlisting">
data = ''
for filename in glob.glob('*.txt'):
    data = data + open(filename).read()
</pre><p>might have problems, depending on when the JVM decides to
garbage-collect the file objects created by the
<span   class="bold"><b>open</b></span> calls. To be conservative,
the code above should be written as
<pre     class="programlisting">
data = ''
for filename in glob.glob('*.txt'):
    file = open(filename)
    data = data + file.read()
    file.close()
</pre>


The final consequence of JPython's delegating memory management to
Java is that <span   class="bold"><b>__del__</b></span> methods in
user-defined classes are never called. There is no theoretical
reason why they couldn't be enabled in the future, but current JVMs
take a massive performance hit if the
<span   class="bold"><b>finalize</b></span> methods perform
nontrivial tasks, which would be required for full __del__-method
support. Given that the Java spec doesn't guarantee that finalize
methods are ever called, relying on __del__ methods would probably
not be a good idea anyway.
</p><p>Let's analyze the first few lines of another sample program,
to explore how Python allows clean interaction with Java libraries,
as shown in Figure 2.</p><p><a href="3840l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3840f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Output from Listing 2
</p></div></div><p>In line 1, we see what looks like a standard Python import
statement. In fact, what goes on behind the scenes is quite
remarkable, as java.awt is neither a .py file nor a compiled
extension. In fact, JPython is making a runtime Python module out
of a Java package. When JPython tries to import a module and can't
find a Python module with the specified name (in this case, java),
it looks in <b  >CLASSPATH</b> for a .class or .jar file,
and then uses Java's introspection mechanism (the reflection API)
to figure out which subpackages and classes are defined in the
file. Using similar mechanisms, JPython finds out that the
<span   class="bold"><b>awt</b></span> subpackage in the
<span   class="bold"><b>java</b></span> package defines a class
BorderLayout. That class is then returned to the Python code
wrapped in a Python object.</p><p>In line 2, we import the swing module from the
<span   class="bold"><b>pawt</b></span> package.
<span   class="bold"><b>pawt</b></span> stands for Python AWT; AWT
stands for Abstract Windowing Toolkit, which is the official name
for the Java GUI. Swing has been packaged in various locations in
the package hierarchy through the years, and pawt does the work of
figuring out which is the case in your installation.</p><p>Lines 3 through 5 simply define a function, which ignores its
sole argument and quits Python.</p><p>Line 6 creates a JFrame instance with the title
&ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>LinuxJournal</em></span> Example&rdquo; and a keyword
argument <b  >visible</b> with a value of 1. What is
hidden is the fact that JPython figured out many things on the fly;
specifically, it found out from Java (using the reflection API)
that JFrame, defined in the Swing package, is a class in which the
constructor takes at most one argument. That argument must be a
Java String, so JPython converts the Python string into a Java
String automatically. The keyword argument
<b  >visible</b> is not part of the constructor signature
for JFrames (Java doesn't support keyword arguments), but JPython
examines JFrame's complete signature and finds that one of JFrame's
base classes, JComponent, defines two methods:
<span   class="bold"><b>setVisible</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>isVisible</b></span>. Based on that
information, JPython infers that &ldquo;visible&rdquo; is a property of
JFrames. (Properties are also obtained by looking at BeanInfo
files, for those who use them.) Once a property has been
identified, JPython programmers can set and get them with the
standard <b  >object.attribute</b> notation, or set them
with keyword arguments in constructor calls. In other words, the
line</p><pre     class="programlisting">
frame = JFrame('LinuxJournal Example', visible=1)
</pre><p>could have been written
<pre     class="programlisting">
frame = JFrame('LinuxJournal Example')
frame.visible = 1
</pre>


or, in Java style:
<pre     class="programlisting">
frame = JFrame('LinuxJournal Example')
frame.setVisible(1)
</pre>


Line 7 is similar to line 6, but JPython had to work a little
harder to determine which of the four signatures for
<span   class="bold"><b>JButton</b></span>'s constructor had to be
used. (JButton can also be called with an Icon, a String and an
Icon, or nothing at all.) Also, the
<b  >actionPerformed</b> keyword argument is even more
sophisticated than the property setting just described. The best
way to explain this feature is to pretend it didn't exist. We can
write
<pre     class="programlisting">
def exit(event):
    sys.exit(0)
button = JButton('Close Me!', actionPerformed=exit)
</pre>


instead of
<pre     class="programlisting">
class action(awt.event.ActionListener):
    def actionPerformed(self,event):
        sys.exit(0)
button = JButton("Close Me!")
button.addActionListener(action())
</pre>


In other words, in standard Java, the event handler for a widget
(e.g., determining what should happen when a button is clicked) is
specified by passing an instance of a class which defines an
actionPerformed method. This fairly cumbersome mechanism is
necessary because Java doesn't allow passing function objects.
JPython allows use of the simpler Python idiom of setting a
callback attribute with a function object, and does the conversion
on the fly. The rest of the program is fairly simple, and cheats
only a little in that <span   class="bold"><b>JTree</b></span>, when
called with no arguments, builds a sample tree automatically (see
Demo/swing/treedemo.py in the JPython distribution for an example
of how to build a tree from scratch).
</p><p>JPython can perform several other magic tricks behind the
scenes, allowing you to write Python code while talking to Java
libraries. All of these are documented on the jpython.org web site.
They include automatic type conversion, subclassing from Java
classes in Python and vice versa, dealing with Java interfaces,
dealing with Java arrays (which are different from Python lists)
and dealing with Unicode. You'll also need to go to the web site to
learn about jpythonc, the JPython compiler, which compiles Python
code to .class files.</p><p>There are two more benefits which JPython brings, not to the
Java world, but to the Python world. First, because it is written
in an object-oriented language, modifying JPython is easier than
modifying CPython. For example, Barry Warsaw added string methods
to JPython in a few hours, but it took him several days to do the
same for CPython. Thus, JPython provides a good testbed for playing
with language features which can be evaluated in a working
implementation before deciding whether to adopt them in the
language specification. The experience gained with JPython's more
unified type model will probably influence future development of
the Python type system.</p><p>In addition, JPython helped the Python community simply by
being the first complete &ldquo;second implementation&rdquo; of the language.
By its very existence, JPython forced Guido to decide what aspects
of CPython were language features, what aspects were implementation
features, and what aspects were, if not bugs, ill-chosen
features.</p><p>JPython's biggest weakness at this point is probably its
relative slowness. The slowness is not too surprising, given the
slowness of the underlying Java platform; still, it is a noticeable
change from CPython's speed. If speed is a concern, then
experimenting with some Just-In-Time compilers (JITs) can provide a
significant boost. If speed is not a concern and you're willing to
help stamp out the remaining bugs, JPython is a very elegant,
full-featured scripting solution for Java systems.</p><p><a href="3840s3.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
