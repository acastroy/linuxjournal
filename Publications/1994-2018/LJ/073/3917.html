    Want your laptop and PC to talk to each other without having
    to deal with wires? Here's how.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1264580.0x135c4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Wireless networking has been around for a
while, but until recently, it was out of reach for Linux users with
modest means. Fortunately, a number of manufacturers are beginning
to see new venues in marketing inexpensive wireless hardware. One
manufacturer, Webgear, Inc., recently introduced a Linux-compatible
wireless networking kit.
</p><p>In this article, I will show how to create an inexpensive
wireless network and a wireless networking bridge using Webgear's
Aviator 2.4 wireless networking kit, IP masquerading, software
routing, a surplus laptop and Linux.</p><p>Webgear's Aviator 2.4 wireless kit consists of two Type II
PCMCIA cards and two ISA PCMCIA card slots. The kit uses 2.4GHz
radio technology to offer 2MBps networking using IEEE 802.11
specifications (frequency-hopping, spread-spectrum networking). The
cards appear as Ethernet devices, such as eth0 or eth1, when
installed and configured. The original intent of the kit is to
offer the ability to create a high-speed wireless link between two
desktop PCs, two laptops, or a laptop and desktop PC.</p><p>Although the kit is advertised as supporting Linux, it comes
with software drivers for only Microsoft operating systems. You'll
have to download the Linux device driver, a loadable kernel module
named ray_cs.o, from the Web. Even though you can get a stable
version through Webgear's support link at
<a href="http://www.webgear.com/support/software_top.html" target="_self">www.webgear.com/support/software_top.html</a>,
the best place to download the latest version is from the author's
web site (see Resources).</p><p>Thanks to the generosity of the author, Corey Thomas, you can
use the Aviator 2.4 (or more expensive Aviator Pro or Raytheon
Raylink series) wireless system with Linux. I downloaded the latest
driver, <span   class="bold"><b>ray_cs</b></span> version 1.68, onto
one of my laptops, then followed his directions on building and
installing the driver:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cp ray_cs-1.68.tgz /usr/src/linux/pcmcia-cs-3.1.5
tar xvzf ray_cs-1.68.tgz
make config
make all
make install
</pre><p>These steps should then be repeated on another computer. I
initially used two laptops to test the connectivity of the cards.
This is essential to ensure the cards and software are working
correctly. I had great success with a later version of David Hinds'
Card Services, pcmcia-cs 3.1.5, along with the next version,
pcmcia-cs 3.1.6.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1264580.0x135c870"></a>Peer-to-Peer Wireless Networking</h2></div></div><p>As sold, the kit allows for connection between two wireless
points: point A<b  >--&gt;</b>point B.</p><p>Before enabling the cards, you must first edit
/etc/pcmcia/config.opts and insert the line</p><pre     class="programlisting">
source ./ray_cs.opts
</pre><p>Upon starting, Card Services will then read in the
ray_cs.opts configuration file for the wireless cards (ray_cs.opts
is copied into the /etc/pcmcia directory as part of <b  >make
install</b>). This file contains several important settings,
in the form of setup strings, used to configure the Aviator 2.4
card after insertion. The settings line (there are several, as the
driver supports at least three different wireless cards) I used
was:
<pre     class="programlisting">
module "ray_cs" opts "pc_debug=2 essid=LINUX\
 hop_dwell=128 beacon_period=256 translate=1"
</pre>


Make sure to use the same settings for each end of the wireless
connection. The <b  >pc_debug=2</b> option is a handy way
to get more information from /var/log/messages upon insertion or
removal of the card. The <b  >essid=LINUX</b> option
designates a network name of LINUX for the wireless cards
(according to Webgear, 61 cards may be on the same network). After
installing and configuring the software, I used Red Hat's
<span   class="bold"><b>netcfg</b></span> tool to create an eth0
interface on each laptop. You can also create your own by editing
the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
DEVICE=eth0
IPADDR=192.168.2.37
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
NETWORK=192.168.2.0
BROADCAST=192.168.2.255
ONBOOT=yes
BOOTPROTO=none
USERCTL=no
</pre>


The cards must be started sequentially. I went to the first laptop,
ensured Card Services was running (you can do an
/etc/rc.d/init.d/pcmcia start), then inserted one of the Aviator
cards. Upon hearing two beeps, I looked at the output of
/var/log/messages (not all the output is shown here):
<pre     class="programlisting">

</pre>


The important thing to look for is the &ldquo;started&rdquo; string. I then
enabled the interface using netcfg, as according to Thomas, you
cannot use the <span   class="bold"><b>ifconfig</b></span> command to
set the IP address using the ray_cs driver. I then went to the
other laptop, inserted the other Aviator card, listened for the two
beeps, and looked at /var/log/messages:
<pre     class="programlisting">

eth0: RayLink, irq 10, hw_addr 00:00:8F:48:E8:45

</pre>


Again, the important string to look for is &ldquo;joined&rdquo;. This means
the cards are communicating. I then enabled the eth0 interface, and
voil&lt;\#224&gt;--I could use
<span   class="bold"><b>ping</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>telnet</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>ftp</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>talk</b></span> between the two laptops
wirelessly. FTP file transfers were about 180K per second, and that
speed is reasonable enough for remote X11 client launching. This
shows that Linux can be used to support wireless networking in a
variety of situations where cabled installations are impractical or
unnecessary.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1264580.0x135cf50"></a>Wireless Masquerading from a Server</h2></div></div><p>While being able to network two laptops wirelessly is a lot
of fun and can be quite handy, I was still not satisfied. I have a
local area network (LAN) in the house, spanning several computers
hubbed together in the basement and up two levels to an upstairs
office with another hub of three computers. Being a Linux user, I
want more from my hardware and wanted to get much more
functionality out of my wireless network. I wanted to be able to
roam the house or sit by the pool with a wireless laptop, and also
network with all computers on the LAN while browsing the Web, doing
e-mail and so on. The cards are advertised as being able to
communicate at least 500 feet through walls and 1000 feet within
&ldquo;line of sight&rdquo;.</p><p>Unfortunately, according to Webgear, the Aviator 2.4 cards
are meant to be used only for peer-to-peer networking. If you
purchase the Aviator Pro line of cards, you can then buy a piece of
hardware called a wireless &ldquo;access point&rdquo; that hooks into your
LAN via RJ45 to provide a bridge into your network or from another
network. The access point costs several hundred dollars, even with
diligent Internet shopping. A wireless access point is not offered
for the Aviator 2.4 series.</p><p>This is where being a member of a Linux users group comes in
handy. Thanks to friends in the Northern Virginia Linux Users
Group, NOVALUG, I was able to create my wireless network. Following
tips from messages on NOVALUG's mailing list, I installed one of
the Aviator ISA PCMCIA slot adapters in my server in the basement.
The server's first interface, eth0, has an assigned IP address of
192.168.2.XX. I installed the Aviator card as eth1 with an IP
address of 192.168.1.1. After the wireless card was &ldquo;started&rdquo;, I
then used the <span   class="bold"><b>route</b></span> command to
route wireless (eth1) traffic through eth0:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/route add 192.168.1.1 gw 191.168.2.
</pre><p>To complete the services, I then crafted a simple IP
masquerading script (based on information courtesy of Greg Pryzby,
NOVALUG's founder):
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
case "$1" in start)
      /sbin/modprobe ip_masq_ftp
/sbin/ipchains -A forward -s 192.168.2.0/24 -j MASQ
/sbin/ipchains -A forward -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j MASQ
      echo "NAT Started" ;; stop)
/sbin/ipchains -F
      echo "NAT Stopped" ;; *)
      echo "Usage: ipmasq {start|stop}" ;;
esac
</pre>


After enabling my PPP connection, wireless card, masquerading and
routing on the server, then connecting to the rest of the LAN and
using the Internet from my wireless laptop (with an assigned IP
address of 192.168.1.2) was quite simple. Again, using the route
command, but this time on the wireless laptop:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/route add default gw 192.168.1.1
</pre>


This configuration allowed me to communicate with all the other
computers on the LAN (such as LaptopA and ComputerB), along with
access to the Internet.
</p><p><a href="3917l1.html" target="_self">Figure 1. Network
Configuration</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1264580.0x135d370"></a>Wireless Masquerading from a Laptop</h2></div></div><p>Then I ran into trouble. When I was down in the basement near
the server, connection tests ran okay with the wireless laptop.
However, when I ranged too far from the server, for some reason the
cards would lose communication, or I could not &ldquo;join&rdquo; the
&ldquo;started&rdquo; server connection. If you read more about wireless
networking's coverage and reliability, you'll learn that the
quality of a connection can be influenced by many factors. I later
found out the equipment in the basement was located too close to an
earthen wall, and for some reason, the signal was being blocked. I
had to move the connection, but I still wanted full access to the
LAN and the Internet.</p><p>I then removed the Aviator card from the server and
reinstalled the card on an ancient spare laptop (LaptopA) upstairs
with two Type II PCMCIA slots. Like the server, one laptop slot
provided an eth0 interface to the LAN (with an IP of 192.168.2.32),
while the other was configured as eth1 with the wireless card (and
an IP of 192.168.1.1). IP masquerading on the server was forwarding
packets from the PPP connection to the laptop, but in order to
provide service to the wireless laptop, I had to use IP
masquerading on LaptopA again:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/ipchains -A forward -s \
192.168.1.0/24 -j MASQ
</pre><p>Now everything worked fine! I could communicate with the rest
of the LAN (such as from the Wireless to Computer B or the Server).
</p><p>A simple route command on the server, using the wireless
laptop's IP address along with the &ldquo;hardwired&rdquo; eth0's IP address
(from LaptopA) also allowed the rest of the LAN to ping the
wireless computer:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/route add 192.168.1.2 \
gw 192.168.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>XX</em></span>
</pre><p>Believe me when I say it was somewhat of a learning
experience&mdash;I never envisioned having to forward information from
two computers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1264580.0x135d6e0"></a>Bridging: An Alternative</h2></div></div><p>I found out you also can easily build a wireless bridge, and
thus not have to use routing to allow a wireless connection to
connect to the rest of a LAN. Using a spare laptop, I first
recompiled Linux to enable bridging. I then installed an eth0
interface with an assigned IP address to connect to the LAN. Next,
I installed the Aviator card as eth1 <span   class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span>
an assigned interface, then brought up both interfaces in
promiscuous mode with</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/ifconfig eth0 promisc up
/sbin/ifconfig eth1 promisc up
</pre><p>Next, I downloaded Alan Cox's
<span   class="bold"><b>brcfg</b></span> utility, and enabled
bridging with
<pre     class="programlisting">
 ./brcfg -ena
</pre>


After starting a wireless connection, I could then access any
computer on the LAN from the wireless laptop.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1264580.0x135d9a0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Wireless networking may not be the best solution if you need
high-speed communication on or between your LANs, but the
combination of Linux and a legacy laptop shows that you can build a
useful and flexible wireless network at low cost. This is just one
of the reasons I use Linux (besides being able to surf the Web
while drinking a pool-side Margarita&mdash;with salt, on the rocks,
thank you).</p><p><a href="3917s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="3917s2.html" target="_self">Acknowledgements</a></p></div></div>
