thought was, &ldquo;This is TINY!&rdquo; I was prepared for something a bit
larger, being used to larger cases for simple A/B switches.
</p><p>However, its small size made it a welcome addition to my
office environment, and its power and flexibility was more than I
expected from a unit dwarfed by a single-space rack-mount case. The
CompuSwitch is an attractive machine in the endless sea of beige
computer hardware. A black CompuSwitch would get more points from
me on the coolness meter. When I was contacted by Michael Slaven,
the OEM manager at Raritan, I was excited about the possible uses
for a KVM (keyboard/video/mouse) switch in a Linux environment that
worked well not only for Linux, but also for DOS, Macintosh systems
and various strains of Windows. For people who use multiple Windows
machines, or in a mixed environment consisting of DOS or Mac OS and
some version of UNIX, one sure way to keep enough room on a desk
for actual work is to use one monitor, one keyboard and one mouse
to do all your stuff on all your computers. The easy, painless and
relatively inexpensive way to accomplish this is with the
CompuSwitch.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bc5580.0x1cbda28"></a>The Tests</h2></div></div><p>I thought I would start my tests using a simple setup, in
case I encountered any problems. For my controller setup, I chose
an IBM AT keyboard (an original one with the great clicky keys, and
the function keys on the left) with a Logitech PS/2 mouse and a
Packard Bell 2160 monitor. See &ldquo;Test Hardware&rdquo; for a complete
list.</p><p>Using a Windows 3.1 machine and one running straight MS-DOS
would ensure as few variables in the mix as possible, while still
enabling me to cover all three: keyboard, video and mouse. One
machine used a PS/2 keyboard and mouse, the other required an AT
keyboard and serial mouse. A simple plug-in, using their great
cables made expressly for the switch, had me ready to hit the
&ldquo;go&rdquo; button in less time than it took me to unpack it. Both
machines came up with keyboard error messages on startup. A quick
change to a no-name PS/2 keyboard put me back on track. Within a
minute, I was happily computing away on two &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; systems,
switching effortlessly between them with the press of a button.
Whether it was in the middle of serious graphics rendering, number
crunching, or sitting idle while contemplating its digital belly
button, each OS behaved as though it was being accessed by its own
keyboard and mouse, displaying on its own monitor.</p><p>Windows 95 worked just as well, switching between it and
DOS.</p><p>Tests using Caldera's OpenLinux 2.2 and Red Hat 6.0 both
performed flawlessly, each having been configured for the test
monitor. Neither KDE nor GNOME seemed to notice the unorthodox
hardware configuration, and performance didn't suffer a bit.</p><p>Slackware was run first in console mode, and it recognized
the monitor and keyboard at boot time. Running FVWM95 went
perfectly too, with a normal setup.</p><p>Next, I hooked up a notebook which ran Windows 98. The PS/2
and USB ports presented no problems for the keyboard and mouse, and
Windows recognized the external monitor with no problems.</p><p>Using a client's Novell and Windows NT servers also presented
zero problems. Both recognized the PS/2 mouse and keyboard, even
though they had been hot-swapped.</p><p>The only Mac I had to test with was an iMac, which ran both
OS 8.6 and Yellow Dog Linux. With Yellow Dog Linux, I was unable to
get the switch to work. I believe it was because this version of
YDL didn't support USB very well, since it was brand-new when I got
it. I had trouble getting even the original iMac keyboard and mouse
to work. The switch, however, worked with the Mac#OS. There was no
USB-to-video adapter, so I was able to use only the keyboard and
mouse, but I've seen setups that could benefit from even this
modest hardware reconfiguration.</p><p>Switching between Linuxes, and between Linux, Mac and
Microsoft operating systems, was as easy as anyone could possibly
make it. By the end of the day, it was apparent that anyone who
needed direct control of multiple physical machines running
Windows, Novell, Mac or Linux would be able to do so without having
to worry about where to place all needed hardware.</p><p>In every test, the CompuSwitch made it as easy to monitor and
control each computer as if each were connected to its own
keyboard, mouse and monitor. I even found myself just switching
back and forth between my own Linux machines instead of mounting
file systems, or using TELNET or FTP.</p><p>I would recommend the CompuSwitch (and already have) to
anyone who has more than one computer to control. Graphic design
service bureaus, network server rooms and home-based businesses
that use multiple computers are environments that can benefit from
using this switch. The cost of the unit is less than you would
spend on the monitors, keyboards and mice it replaces, and
certainly takes up less desk space.</p><p><a href="3923s1.html" target="_self">Test Hardware</a></p></div></div>
