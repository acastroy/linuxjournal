Belgian pop-surrealist, will outlive the undertalented, over-hyped
Andy Warhol (1927-1987) in my book. My sister Doreen always called
him Andy Arsehole, and thought she was more worthy of the 15
minutes of fame for this remark than Warhol was for his pretentious
3-hour movie of a sleeping man. &ldquo;Call me a Palestine [note 1],&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;but I dozed off after 10 seconds.&rdquo;
</p><p>Warhol's cans of soup are merely &ldquo;cans of soup&rdquo; (limited
shelf life?), whereas Magritte's equally realistic rendition of a
briar pipe is teasingly titled &ldquo;This is not a pipe&rdquo;. I've made a
copy of this painting called &ldquo;This is not a copy of `This is not a
pipe&rdquo;'--sure to win next year's Turner Prize. Space precludes a
full, emetic account of the family visit to the London Tate Gallery
in December, 1999. Suffice to say we all stood gazing at Exhibit A,
the infamous &ldquo;unmade bed&rdquo;, thinking, &ldquo;Sh..., we used to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>dream</em></span> of sleeping so bourgeois comfy.&rdquo;</p><p>The Magritte joke digs deeply into the serious
anti-self-referential paradoxes that have threatened the very
foundations of logic, mathematics, computer science, and all we
hold dear [note 2]. The rash Cretan swore that &ldquo;all Cretans are
liars&rdquo;. Russell denied entry in the only club that would have had
him as a member [note 3]. G&ouml;del proved that &ldquo;this proposition
is unprovable&rdquo;. Turing asked, &ldquo;Wanna wait 'til this program
halts?&rdquo; And the ever-elegant Chaitin says, &ldquo;There's no elegant
algorithm for establishing its elegance.&rdquo;</p><p>Briefly, in Chaitin's algorithmic information theory, a
program is &ldquo;elegant&rdquo; if no smaller program written in the same
programming language has the same output for a given input. Rush
back to your methodologies, patterns, use-cases, UML flow charts,
include files, class frameworks and source code (if any), you
inelegant swine! Unless, of course, you are paid by LOC (lines of
code).</p><p>Most busy humanist mathematicians, such as Lakatos, Hersh and
myself, have other rent-paying grapes to fry.</p><p>For example, back in the real (sez who?) world, provably
elegant Linux gathers momentum. For those who still ask how to
pronounce &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;, I checked with several IPO billionaires and
was told &ldquo;two short, equally stressed syllables as in Red
Hat&rdquo;.</p><p>The latest Corel incarnation has just arrived in the
largest-ever shrink-wrapped box! As a JOLT judge, my lips are
sealed and incorruptible, but there's a growing number of Linux
candidates in each year's list of nominations, and I have an
intuitive urge to support Corel and its Linux-aware WordPerfect. As
with the Academy Awards, the number of JOLT Award categories also
increases, and we are close to having &ldquo;Best Linux Spreadsheet by
an Albanian Unijamb&rdquo;.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>BUT</em></span> a warning from
