excellent resource for learning what was once the most common word
processor available. Nearly seven hundred pages of instruction,
very clearly written, detail almost everything you would want to
know about the Linux version of WordPerfect.</p><p>A complete version&mdash;yes, you read that correctly&mdash;of
WordPerfect 8 Personal Edition comes on the CD with the book, with
over 5,000 clip art images and 140 fonts, as well as KDE 1.1. This
is obviously a bargain, as the book and CD together are only $40
USD.</p><p>The first chapter covers installation in a reasonably
thorough manner. In Chapter Two, a general overview of the
WordPerfect environment is given in the form of a tutorial on
writing a letter. This explains the basics of text entry in
WordPerfect, the Spell-As-You-Go auto-correction feature, selecting
and manipulating text, and saving your document.</p><p>We begin to delve into detail in Chapter Three, which covers
the WordPerfect interface. This includes such things as getting
around the screen, keystrokes, title bars and fine-tuning the
document window display. In the fourth chapter, we move into
formatting, with the Format-As-You-Go feature, drop caps and
QuickFormatting. Chapter Five goes over WordPerfect help, including
the PerfectExpert.</p><p>Part II begins with a cautionary chapter on safeguarding your
work&mdash;timed backups, undo and Corel Versions are all discussed.
WordPerfect actually has a miniature file manager, which is what
Chapter Seven covers. In the eighth chapter, you learn about the
wonderful world of Linux fonts&mdash;including the necessity of actually
installing them. Adding clip art and other images to your documents
is the subject of Chapter Nine, as well as inserting line art,
boxes, and the WP Draw tools. Chapter Ten explains how to print
your documents the way you want them printed&mdash;booklets, envelopes,
print jobs and printer settings are all here.</p><p>If you want to take your document and publish it on the Web,
Chapter Eleven is for you. While WordPerfect may not be the most
advanced web editor (and it certainly doesn't try to be), it is
useful for quick publication, and this chapter will show you how to
do just that.</p><p>Since WordPerfect is predominantly used for writing actual
documents, Part III centers on the tools you would use in penning
concise, grammatically correct prose. Chapter Twelve helps you
learn to use the spell checker, how to find that word on the tip of
your tongue that is still eluding you, and how to write in French,
Spanish, German, or any of the other languages that WordPerfect
supports. Editing techniques&mdash;text selection, finding and
replacing, bookmarks and comments&mdash;are discussed in the thirteenth
chapter. In Chapter Fourteen, you learn how to get your pages
numbered just right. The fifteenth chapter covers document
formatting in detail: justification, paragraph formatting, styles,
margins, headers, watermarks and so on. Tables and columns are
explained in Chapter Sixteen.</p><p>For those budding novelists, Part IV covers working with
large documents. This includes bullets and outlines (Chapter
Seventeen), document references such as footnotes, lists and tables
of contents (Chapter Eighteen) and multipart documents (Chapter
Nineteen).</p><p>Part V centers on more advanced usage, such as templates,
styles in full detail, calculations and formulas, sorting
information, equations and charting data. The final section focuses
on customization: the WordPerfect preferences, the toolbar and menu
customization, and mass producing with labels and merge. And, of
course, macros.</p><p>I would seriously recommend this book for those who are
interested in WordPerfect and its Linux port. Not only does it come
with the full version on CD, but it is well-written, humorous at
times and easy to understand.</p></div></div>
