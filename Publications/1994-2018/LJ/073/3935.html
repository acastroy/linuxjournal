    A continuation of our introduction to path variables and elements.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2135580.0x222d3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>In this final article in the series, I'll
describe the remaining path handling functions and point out a few
implementation issues. Before I do that, however, I will describe a
utility called <span   class="bold"><b>makepath</b></span>. This
reads either standard input or its argument list, builds a
colon-separated path variable (pathvar) from those lines read and
echoes it to standard output. For example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ makepath /bin /usr/bin /opt/kde/bin
/bin:/usr/bin:/opt/kde/bin
</pre>


<span   class="bold"><b>makepath</b></span> is used in several of the
pathvar utilities to reconstruct a pathvar after its path elements
(pathels) have been altered. I won't show you the innards of
makepath, as they're somewhat tangential to the main topic and
rather trivial.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2135580.0x222d5b0"></a>listpath</h2></div></div><p>First, let's look at
<span   class="bold"><b>listpath</b></span>, which echoes the pathels
making up a pathvar on separate lines, as in:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ listpath -p MANPATH
/usr/man
/usr/local/man
/opt/CC/man
</pre><p>Using listpath has two advantages over merely echoing
<b  >$MANPATH</b>. First, it's much easier to read the
pathels when they appear on separate lines; and secondly, you can
pipe its output through <span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span>:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ listpath | grep bin
/opt/kde/bin
/usr/local/bin
/bin
</pre>


There is no option-handling code we did not see in the
<span   class="bold"><b>addpath</b></span> function, so let's look at
the main code:
<pre     class="programlisting">
eval echo
</pre>


This is very simple. We just echo the contents of the specified
pathvar into the <span   class="bold"><b>colon2line</b></span>
function (included in the tar file mentioned at the end of this
article), which turns the embedded : characters into newline
characters. I described the operation of this piece of code in some
detail in Part 2, so I won't repeat it here. Take a look at that
article
(<a href="../072/3768.html" target="_self">http://www.linuxjournal.com/lj.issues/issue72/3768.html</a>)
if you're not sure why the <span   class="bold"><b>eval</b></span> is
there.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2135580.0x222da80"></a>delpath</h2></div></div><p>We have already seen the addpath function, which performs an
idempotent addition of a pathel to a pathvar. The converse of this
behaviour is provided by <span   class="bold"><b>delpath</b></span>,
which removes pathels from a pathvar. So, for example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
delpath /opt/CC/test/bin
</pre><p>will remove the /opt/CC/test/bin directory from
<b  >$PATH</b> and:
<pre     class="programlisting">
delpath -e "(bill|steve)" -p MANPATH
</pre>


will remove all pathels matching the
<span   class="bold"><b>egrep</b></span>-style regular expression
<b  >"(bill|steve)"</b> from <b  >$MANPATH</b>.
The command
<pre     class="programlisting">
delpath -n
</pre>


removes all non-existent directories from <b  >$PATH</b>.
</p><p>Although delpath is not a function you are likely to need
often, there is one place where it can be useful. Many UNIX
machines have a file called /etc/PATH, which is sourced by
/etc/profile. It sets up a default PATH containing directories
required by all users. Too often, though, /etc/PATH is not modified
for years at a time, and the directories added either no longer
exist or are not truly required by all. In this case, you can call
delpath at the start of an appropriate login script (.profile or
.bash_profile) to remove the directories you do not need.</p><p>Let's look at the delpath code. I'll skip most of the option
handling, as much of it is identical to that in addpath.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
MATCH="-x"            # default
[ -n "$opt_e" ] &amp;&amp; MATCH= # make grep use regexps
FILTER=              # default
[ -n "$opt_n" ] &amp;&amp; FILTER="| realpath_filter"
</pre><p>Here, we see the final section of the option handling. The
<b  >MATCH</b> variable determines whether we handle the
supplied path description as a regular expression or not. It is
used later as an option to grep; <b  >grep -x</b> tells
grep to perform exact string matches.
</p><p>The <b  >FILTER</b> variable implements the
<b  >-n</b> option, i.e., the &ldquo;remove non-existent
directories&rdquo; behaviour. If the user supplies the
<b  >-n</b> option, <b  >FILTER</b> contains a
string which pipes the output of a previous command through a
program called <span   class="bold"><b>realpath_filter</b></span>.
This program reads directory names from its standard input and
writes the name to standard output only if it is an existing
directory. I'll leave it as an easy exercise for the reader to
implement such a filter.</p><p>The remainder of delpath is as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
eval listpath -p $pathvar $FILTER |
  grep -v -E $MATCH "$1"&gt; /tmp/makepath_in.$$
eval $pathvar=$(makepath &lt; /tmp/makepath_in.$$)
rm /tmp/makepath_in.$$
</pre><p>The function does its work in three stages. The first command
generates a file in /tmp containing those directories that are not
to be deleted. The second command rebuilds the pathvar from that
file using makepath. Finally we remove the file; we don't want it
cluttering up the file system after the function finishes. (The
shell expands <b  >$$</b> to the process ID of the shell
running the command; I'll assume it is 20610 in this article.)
</p><p>Let's look at the first line. Essentially, it uses
<span   class="bold"><b>listpath</b></span> to break the appropriate
pathvar into separate lines, and grep to remove those we don't
want. It's slightly complicated, however, by the presence of the
<b  >FILTER</b> variable. Suppose the user types:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
delpath -e "^opt"
</pre><p>which means &ldquo;remove all directories starting with the
<b  >opt</b> string from <b  >$PATH</b>&rdquo;. In
this case, pathvar will contain <b  >PATH</b>, while
<b  >MATCH</b> and <b  >FILTER</b> will be
empty. The first line will therefore expand to:
<pre     class="programlisting">
eval listpath -p PATH |
  grep -v -E "^opt&lt;" &gt; /tmp/makepath_in.20610
</pre>


This is straightforward&mdash;listpath writes the pathels in
<b  >PATH</b> into the grep command, which we use to echo
non-matching lines only (<b  >-v</b>). We redirect the
output into our temporary file, which will contain those pathels
not starting with <b  >opt</b>. In this case, the leading
eval is unnecessary. However, if the user types
<pre     class="programlisting">
delpath -n
</pre>


to remove all non-existent directories from
<b  >$PATH</b>, then the first line expands to
<pre     class="programlisting">
eval listpath -p PATH | realpath_filter |
grep -v -E "" &gt; /tmp/makepath_in.20610
</pre>


During the initial processing of the line (i.e., before the eval
has forced re-evaluation), the shell saw the pipe symbol preceding
the grep, but it did not see the pipe symbol preceding
realpath_filter. As things stand at the moment, the shell sees the
first | as a literal character and will pass it as an argument to
listpath. This happened because the shell looks for | characters
before it expands variables, and the | character preceding
realpath_filter was stored in a variable. The second evaluation
caused by the eval ensures the pipeline that runs the
realpath_filter command is constructed.
</p><p>We now have a file containing only the required pathels. The
second line in delpath rebuilds the pathvar from that file, using
the following code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
eval $pathvar=$(makepath &lt; /tmp/makepath_in.$$)
</pre><p>This shouldn't cause us too many problems. First, makepath
simply reads the lines in the file, builds a colon-separated
pathvar and echoes it. We run makepath in command-substitution mode
(that's the <b  >$(...)</b> which I described in Part 2),
so makepath's output is used as the right-hand side of the variable
assignment. The initial eval is required due to the order in which
the shell evaluates a command. Because it looks for assignment
statements before expanding variables, it won't recognize that the
command contains a valid assignment. The eval ensures the
assignment takes place the second time the line is processed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2135580.0x222ebb0"></a>uniqpath</h2></div></div><p>Suppose you log on to your UNIX system and discover, for
reasons beyond your control, that PATH is full of duplicate
entries. (Humour me. It does happen. Maybe your system
administrator modified /etc/PATH inadvisedly). Let's assume these
duplicates are making your PATH undesirably long. Is there anything
you can do to clean things up? Yes, you can type at the
prompt:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ uniqpath
</pre><p>This will remove any duplicate entries from your path,
leaving the order of the remaining pathels intact. For example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ NEWP=fred:bill:steve:fred:dave:bill
$ uniqpath -p NEWP
$ echo $NEWP
fred:bill:steve:dave
</pre>


Let's skip the options-handling code again, and look at the meat:
<pre     class="programlisting">
npath=$(listpath -p $pathvar | awk '{seen[$0]++;
if (seen[$0]==1){print}}')
    eval $pathvar=$(makepath "$npath")
</pre>


As usual, <b  >$pathvar</b> contains the name of the
pathvar we want to modify. The code is rather similar to that of
delpath. The first line generates a variable
(<b  >npath</b>) containing the unique path elements, and
the second line rebuilds the pathvar from those elements using
makepath. We don't use an external file to store the pathels, but
keep everything in shell variables. This is done in order to
demonstrate an alternative technique&mdash;there is no deeper reason.
</p><p>The first line runs listpath to break the pathvar into
separate lines and pipes them through an
<span   class="bold"><b>awk</b></span> filter which removes duplicate
pathels. You may be wondering why we don't just use the
<span   class="bold"><b>uniq</b></span> program instead of awk's
magic. It's because uniq will remove duplicate lines from its input
only if they happen to be adjacent. In our case, the duplicate
pathels will generally not be adjacent, so
<span   class="bold"><b>uniq</b></span> won't work. &ldquo;Aha,&rdquo; you say,
&ldquo;why not use <b  >sort -u</b>? That will sort the lines
and remove duplicates.&rdquo; True enough, however, it may also modify
the directory search order, if we ran
<span   class="bold"><b>uniqpath</b></span> to alter
<b  >PATH</b>. Usually, people care about the order in
which their PATH directories are searched, and it's a bad idea to
modify it.</p><p>Thus, we have the awk solution. This uses a powerful feature
of awk known as an associative array or hash (if you have a Perl
background). If you're a C programmer, you'll know what an array
is: a group of objects of the same type, indexed by an integer. The
contents of an array can be accessed by expressions like values[0]
or values[20], which refer to the first and twenty-first elements,
respectively. A hash is rather like an array which can be indexed
by an arbitrary string of characters. So, in awk notation, we could
write</p><pre     class="programlisting">
age["bill"]=27
</pre><p>to assign 27 to the hash element indexed by the string
<b  >bill</b> in the hash called <b  >age</b>.
Let's look at the awk code shown above.
</p><p>Between the single quotes, we have a block of code run each
time awk reads a new line from its standard input. When awk reads a
line, it is stored in a special variable called
<b  >$0</b>, and we use <b  >$0</b> as an index
into a hash called <b  >seen</b>. (We haven't declared
this anywhere&mdash;that's okay in awk. Variables spring into existence,
with numerical value 0, when they appear in the code). We use the
<b  >seen</b> hash to tell us whether awk has already
seen an identical line of input since it started executing. Let's
see what happens in the <b  >NEWP</b> example shown
above.</p><p>First, listpath splits <b  >NEWP</b> into lines
containing the following strings: &ldquo;fred&rdquo;, &ldquo;bill&rdquo;, &ldquo;steve&rdquo;,
&ldquo;fred&rdquo;, &ldquo;dave&rdquo; and &ldquo;bill&rdquo;, which are read in that order by
awk. <span   class="bold"><b>awk</b></span> stores each line it reads
in <b  >$0</b>, so <b  >$0</b> takes on the
values &ldquo;fred&rdquo;, &ldquo;bill&rdquo; and so on, in turn. Each time a line is
read, the corresponding element of the <b  >seen</b> hash
is incremented (by the line <b  >seen[$0]++</b>) and is
printed only if it has been seen exactly once (by the print
statement in the <b  >if</b> block, which prints
<b  >$0</b> to standard output by default). If we look at
the hash element <b  >seen["fred"]</b>, this is initially
0 and is then set to 1 when awk reads the first &ldquo;fred&rdquo; line,
remains at 1 for the next two lines, and is set to 2 when awk reads
the second &ldquo;fred&rdquo; line. It is printed only when it is seen for
the first time. C programmers should note how syntactically elegant
this solution is and how little code is required when compared to
the equivalent in C.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2135580.0x22260f8"></a>edpath</h2></div></div><p>The final pathvar function we're going to see is
<span   class="bold"><b>edpath</b></span>. This breaks the pathels in
a pathvar into separate lines, writes them to a temporary file and
runs an editor on that file. You can edit the pathels to your
heart's content and quit from the editor when you're finished. The
pathvar is then reconstructed from the modified lines in the file.
<span   class="bold"><b>edpath</b></span> allows you to perform
arbitrary modifications on a pathvar. I use it most often when I
wish to swap the order of directories in
<b  >PATH</b>.</p><p>The code for edpath is fairly straightforward (ignoring once
again the boring details of option handling):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
TEMP=/tmp/edpath.out.$$
VAR=\$$pathvar  # VAR="$LIBPATH" for example
eval export OLD$pathvar=$VAR  # store old path in
                              # e.g. OLDPATH
listpath -p $pathvar &gt; $TEMP  # write path
                              #  elements to file
${EDITOR:-vi} $TEMP           # edit the file eval
$pathvar=$(makepath &lt; $TEMP) # reconstruct path
/bin/rm -f $TEMP           # remove temporary file
</pre><p>Let's skip the first three lines for now. The real work is
done by the block of code starting with listpath. This follows a
similar pattern as delpath and uniqpath. First, we separate the
pathels in the pathvar using listpath, but this time, we redirect
the output into a temporary file. The next line edits that file.
The expression <b  >${EDITOR:-vi}</b> may be unfamiliar;
it means &ldquo;Use the value of the <b  >EDITOR</b> variable
if it is non-null, else use vi.&rdquo; This allows the user to specify
his favourite editor by setting the <b  >EDITOR</b>
environment variable (to Emacs, perhaps) but uses vi if he has not
done so. Note that the <span   class="bold"><b>edit</b></span>
command is run in the foreground, so the shell will wait until the
editor process terminates before running any more commands from the
shell function. When this occurs, the modified pathvar will be
reconstructed by the line starting with <b  >eval</b>. If
you read the description of delpath given above, you'll know how
this line works.
</p><p>Lines 2 and 3 of the code are a safety net. They store the
initial value of the pathvar to be edited in a new environment
variable. If the user is editing <b  >PATH</b>, for
example, then the code creates a variable called
<b  >OLDPATH</b>. If the user makes unwanted
modifications to her <b  >PATH</b>, she can simply
type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ PATH=$OLDPATH
</pre><p>and all will be well.
