    This was a major conference with more than just the usual
    suspects in attendance, and everyone had a big announcement.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1569580.0x16611e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Back home from LinuxWorld, the first
Linux conference held on the West Coast, I am finding it difficult
to concentrate and get back in the normal groove. I spent a
remarkable two days, March 2 and 3, in the San Jose Convention
Center and everyone who didn't go has been dropping by to find out
about it. This was a major conference with more than just the usual
suspects in attendance, and everyone had a big announcement.
</p><p>Over 6,000 people turned out to join in the excitement.
Described by one attendee as &ldquo;heady stuff&rdquo;, I can't think of a
better way to describe it. The attendance by the big-name vendors
is a sure sign that Linux has made the big leagues. When
introducing Dr. Michael Cowpland's keynote speech, Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo;
Hall described this conference as Linux's &ldquo;coming out&rdquo; or &ldquo;sweet
16&rdquo; party, with the business community embracing the Linux
community and Linux embracing business&mdash;&ldquo;Welcome to the world of
Linux!&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Dr. Cowpland gave an articulate speech, focusing on the ways
Corel is using Linux now and in the future. While I was a bit
surprised to learn the first keynote was a company presentation, it
certainly gave a clear picture of how big business perceives Linux
as an excellent opportunity for promoting growth and profit. Dr.
Cowpland said again that Corel would be porting all their products
to Linux and continuing to support the WINE project. His
presentation of the Quattro Pro spreadsheet program running on WINE
was quite impressive&mdash;fast and quite attractive. He announced
WordPerfect Office 2000, stressing their goal of &ldquo;value,
performance and compatibility&rdquo;, and a Corel distribution which
will combine the best features from each of the current
distributions and be ready for release in the fall. He predicted
that by the end of the year, we will be able to buy
high-performance computers, such as Gateway, for $600 to $800,
preloaded with Linux. Sounds good to me.</p><p>Linus gave a well-received keynote address and participated
on a panel discussion of &ldquo;The Continuing Revolution&rdquo;, moderated
by Eric Raymond. He also showed up at the Compaq booth with Jon
Hall for fans to visit, take photos and get autographs.</p><p>I attended only one other talk (too much booth duty) and that
one was by Larry Wall (See in this issue). Larry has a casual
speaking style that fits well into this environment. Two quotes I
enjoyed were:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Perl does one thing right&mdash;it integrates all its
features into one language.</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Journalists who give Perl bad press should
experience more angst in their writing.</p></blockquote></div><p>Speaker Dan Quinlan will also be appearing in our pages soon.
Dan is writing a feature article for our June Standards issue.
</p><p>I spent a good bit of time talking to various vendors. Here's
a bit of what I found out:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Tripwire Security Systems, Inc.: Tripwire is a file
integrity security system (see &ldquo;Tripping up Intruders with
Tripwire&rdquo; by Kevin Fenzi, August 1997) that became commercial in
January of this year. All 2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> releases are
still freely available and include the basic support of 48-hour
e-mail response. They provide extended support (4-hour response)
for a fee. Biggest additions are Algomol encryption for the
database, damage inventories and e-mail warnings when damaged files
are found. I brought back a Tripwire CD for our system
administrator to play with, so expect a review in a future
issue.</p></li><li><p>GraphOn: This company is promoting their Go-Global
thin PC X server software designed for high-speed access to
UNIX/X-based applications on the server from any desktop. A web
site has been established at http://playpen.graphon.com/, where
Windows users can enjoy the experience of running Linux. Corel, a
partner of GraphOn, has embedded the thin-client software in
WordPerfect 8, making it web-enabled.</p></li><li><p>ICP Vortex: This German-based company has the
number one RAID controller in Europe and they have a fully bootable
implementation for Linux. Drivers for their controller can be found
in all major distributions. Beginning this month, they are shipping
a 64-bit PCI-fibre channel RAID controller, which can also be run
in 32-bit slots. ICP is committed to continuing support of the
Linux operating system. One of their big users in the U.S. is Linux
Hardware Solutions, and they have promised us a review of this
excellent RAID device.</p></li><li><p>Precision Insight: With funding from Red Hat and
XGI, this company is creating an OpenGL 3-D infrastructure within
XFree86 servers that will enable developers to access device
drivers which permit access to OpenGL clients.</p></li><li><p>Cygnus Solutions: Cygnus Solutions has had an open
source business model since 1989, providing support for open source
software. It is now a member of the Fortune 500. At this show, they
talked to me about the cross-compilers included in their GNUPro
Toolkit for Linux. The Toolkit includes all the popular GNU tools,
along with added features and custom enhancements such as a
graphical user interface to the tools.</p></li><li><p>IBM demonstrated several of their products that now
run on Linux, including the WebSphere product line, the Andrew File
System and the DB2 database system. Also on display was the first
commercial, Java-based emulator for Linux called IBM Host
On-Demand. This product provides secure access to data and
applications via a web browser. When I asked how it happened that
IBM was entering the Linux market, the answer was &ldquo;user demand&rdquo;.
How about that&mdash;asking for what you want truly works!</p></li><li><p>Informix: Janet Smith of Informix graciously came
by the <i  >Linux Journal</i> booth to visit me while I
was on booth duty. Informix has a very large presence among value
added resellers (VARs) and recently formed an alliance with
Hewlett-Packard to deliver Linux-based Internet solutions through
their Covision program. Informix also announced an alliance with
Jones Business Systems, by which Informix Linux products will be
distributed through JBS' reseller channels. HP was also at the
conference to show off OpenMail, but I didn't get the chance to
talk to them.</p></li><li><p>Stalker Software: Ali Liptrot of Stalker Software
also came by to say &ldquo;hi&rdquo;. When I went by their booth, it was
flooded with traffic to see the demonstrations of their CommuniGate
Pro messaging system.</p></li><li><p>Appgen Business Software, Inc.: Jim Kelly stopped
by to tell me about their financial software. I had thought
financial software was one place Linux was weak&mdash;looks like I was
wrong.</p></li></ul></div><p>All the major distributions were there giving away t-shirts
and other goodies, and in general amazing everyone with their new
releases. I saw a beta demonstration of Caldera's next release of
OpenLinux which has the easiest install I've ever seen. They've
provided a GUI using QT from Troll Tech, and it just zips through,
probing for mouse and other information, completing the install
without the user having to do a thing. It even provides a window so
you can play Tetris while waiting for the install to complete. Not
having a &ldquo;smart&rdquo; install is one item many people have said was a
major drawback for Linux&mdash;well, now Linux has it. One more reason
for not using Linux has just been blown away.
</p><p>While doing booth duty on Wednesday, I got to meet many of
our readers and authors as well as introduce new people to
<i  >Linux Journal</i>. I had a lot of fun. We shared
our booth space with our publisher SSC, there to promote their
latest book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Artists' Guide to the GIMP</em></span> by
Michael J. Hammel. Michael was there and many fans showed up to
meet him and have their books signed.</p><p>All in all, it was a great show and IDG is planning a repeat
performance in August. So if you missed it, come and drop by the
<i  >LJ</i> booth then for a visit. Heady stuff,
indeed!</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3340f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
