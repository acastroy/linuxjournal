    Mr. Haisley provides some PPP customization scripts for web

    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1332580.0x142a450"></a></h2></div></div><p>I operate a small web hosting service,
specializing in services for the arts community and for small local
businesses. As is customary, I offer a variety of support services
to all my clients, including the ability to dial directly to my
server and connect to the Internet using the point-to-point
protocol (PPP). All services, including PPP access, are provided by
a venerable and extremely reliable 486 running the latest
production release of the Linux kernel.
</p><p>Having spent a couple of years helping to build one of
Austin's first Internet service providers during the early days of
the Internet, I am familiar with the process of using UNIX to find
original solutions to unsolved problems. At that time, there were
no Portmasters, and dial-up access was provided by UNIX boxes,
Digiboards and clever programming. Many solutions and tools which
are commonplace today were unknown or only experimental
then.</p><p>Modern releases of Linux offer a good deal more to work with
than did the early non-Linux kernels; nevertheless, when I
developed my own dial-up access, I found that while all parts of my
dial-up system were available, several functions important to me
were not available in the published packages. In particular, I
wanted to offer full Internet access as a subscription service.
Customers who chose not to subscribe to this service would still
have full access via PPP dial up to the file spaces on their local
web site using FTP or http. I also needed a way to implement
session timeouts based on inactivity. While all my customers are
above average in terms of their sense of responsibility in such
matters, everyone has attention lapses from time to time, walking
away from an on-line session without logging off and hanging
up.</p><p>The software I found readily available was the excellent
<span   class="bold"><b>mgetty+sendfax</b></span> package by Gert
Doering and the Debian/GNU distribution of
<span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span>.
<span   class="bold"><b>mgetty</b></span> manages communication with
a modem and provides essential login functions, while pppd manages
PPP protocol issues. Recent versions of mgetty (I am using
mgetty-0.99.2) are capable of detecting incoming attempts at PPP
negotiation and, if properly configured, will invoke pppd with a
variety of options, passing over to it the responsibility for user
authentication.</p><p>While this combination is quite flexible, it is not a totally
integrated solution. <span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> reads
and takes setup instructions from user .ppprc files, and my first
thought was that setting up a read-only, root-owned .ppprc file for
each customer would give me the flexibility I needed to provide the
Internet access permissions and limitations I wanted on a
per-account basis. Unfortunately, the situation is not quite this
simple. Because mgetty runs and invokes pppd as root, the only
.ppprc file which pppd reads is ~root/.ppprc. User identification
and authentication takes place <span   class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> the
~/.ppprc file is read&mdash;not very useful for my purpose.</p><p>Fortunately, pppd provides a very nice open-ended hook in the
form of two built-in script calls:
<span   class="bold"><b>ip-up</b></span> (Listing 1 in the archive
file) which is executed immediately after the network control
protocol (IPCP) for PPP has come up, and
<span   class="bold"><b>ip-down</b></span> (Listing 2 in the archive
file) which is executed immediately after the link has gone down.
Both scripts are provided with the interface name, tty device,
speed, local IP address and remote IP address as command
parameters, and from these, almost everything one might need to
know about a PPP session can be discovered. Both ip-up and ip-down
run with a real and effective user ID of root, eliminating any
potential problems with user-owned processes executing system
commands. Because I could do my per-user configurations from a
single script, I could localize all my user information in a single
data file.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1332580.0x142a978"></a>Proxy ARP</h2></div></div><p>To grant full Internet access to a pppd dial-up client, pppd
invokes a technique called proxy ARP. A host using proxy ARP
advertises a dial-up client's IP address linked to its own Ethernet
interface address. IP traffic destined for the dial-up client is
therefore sent to the host, which dutifully forwards it via the PPP
interface. <span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> can be configured
on invocation to set up proxy ARP, either on the command line or in
any one of its several configuration files, including the user
.ppprc file. Proxy ARP can also be set up &ldquo;manually&rdquo; using the
<span   class="bold"><b>arp</b></span> command to manipulate the
kernel's ARP cache. Because none of the pppd configuration files
can be used to distinguish one user from another, I chose to set up
proxy ARP using a shell invocation of arp in the ip-up Perl
script.</p><p>Using the arp command to set up proxy ARP requires two pieces
of information: the IP address assigned to the dial-up client and
the machine address of the Ethernet interface to which packets
should be delivered. The dial-up IP address is passed as a
parameter to ip-up. The hardware address of the appropriate
Ethernet interface can be obtained from a couple of sources, but
the easiest way to is to parse the information returned from
<span   class="bold"><b>ifconfig</b></span>. This address can also be
hard coded into the script, since it is not likely to change in the
short term.</p><p>For ip-up to know whether to set up proxy ARP, it must know
the identity of the user for whom it was invoked. Although the
identity of the current user is not one of the items provided to
ip-up by pppd, the name of the connecting tty device
<span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> available and associated with a user name
in the system's utmp file. Invoking
<span   class="bold"><b>who</b></span> provides a conveniently
formatted table, which can be parsed to obtain the name of the user
currently connected to any tty device. I use the user name as an
index into a small flat file, /etc/ppp/proxyarp, which consists of
a series of lines of tab-delimited data pairs, each pair consisting
of a user name and either a &ldquo;+&rdquo; or a &ldquo;-&rdquo; indicating whether to
set up proxy ARP for that particular user. With this information,
ip-up has everything it needs to set up proxy ARP for a session and
determine if appropriate to do so.</p><p>One &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo; which must be addressed in this scheme is ARP
caching by the LAN gateway. The Cisco 750 series router which I use
is reluctant to provide any information on or means of manipulating
its internal ARP cache, and the default timeout (about five
minutes) means that any connection made within this timeout period
after a previous call will inherit the packet routing of the
previous connection. While it is not a serious problem for me if my
non-Internet users occasionally get full Internet access, a busy
ISP would need to be able to exercise tighter control in this
matter.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1332580.0x142ad40"></a>Session Time Monitoring</h2></div></div><p>Monitoring session time and network activity is relatively
easy under Linux. All the necessary information on packet traffic
through each interface is made available by the Linux kernel in the
pseudo-file /proc/net/dev, laid out as follows in a format that is
both easy to read and easy to parse (see Listing 4). Inactivity
timeouts can be triggered by the number of packets received,
packets transmitted or a combination of these.</p><p><a href="2936l4.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
4.</b></span></a></p><p>My timeout mechanism uses both the ip-up and ip-down scripts
and a third Perl script, timeout.pl (Listing 3 in the archive
file), which runs from the root crontab file every five minutes.
<span   class="bold"><b>ip-up</b></span> creates a session file,
/var/run/ppp<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>.session (where
<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> in ppp<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> designates the
appropriate interface). This file contains six fields:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The user name of the account owning the session
(for logging and notification)</p></li><li><p>The process ID of the ppid process</p></li><li><p>The time the session began</p></li><li><p>The time activity was last observed on the
interface</p></li><li><p>The total number of packets received on the
interface</p></li><li><p>The total number of packets transmitted to the
interface</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>timeout.pl</b></span> reads the session
file for each PPP interface each time it runs. If the total session
time has not been exceeded, it checks the traffic on the interface.
If it observes activity, it records the time and traffic statistics
and rewrites the session file. If no traffic has occurred since the
last check, the script checks the time since traffic was last
observed and exits if the inactivity timeout has not been exceeded.
If either of the timeout times has been exceeded, the script sends
a SIGINT signal to the pppd process, causing it to execute an
orderly hang up, which includes execution of the ip-down script.
<span   class="bold"><b>ip-down</b></span> deletes the session file
and any proxy ARP entry for the interface currently in the ARP
cache.
</p><p>With the exception of the reluctant router ARP cache noted
above, this system works quite well in all respects. I have
included optional e-mail notification in timeout.pl, so it sends me
e-mail whenever a timeout occurs. I can also force a timeout by
executing timeout.pl manually with a <b  >-t</b> or
<b  >-i</b> option. Adding system logging of timeout
events is on my &ldquo;to do&rdquo; list, but should be a relatively simple
matter.</p><p><a href="2936s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
