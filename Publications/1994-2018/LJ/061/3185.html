    A look at three programs designed to help the C programmer
    find the cause of segmentation fault errors.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f86580.0x207e450"></a></h2></div></div><p>All C programmers have seen, at least
once, the horrible words &ldquo;Segmentation fault&mdash;Core dumped&rdquo; after
a run of their latest creation. Usually, this message is due to
errors in the memory management. (As all C programmers know, this
language does not care about bounds or limit when accessing
memory.) In this article, I plan to compare three products used to
track down this kind of error:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Checker 0.9.9.1</p></li><li><p>Electric Fence 2.0.5</p></li><li><p>Mem-Test 0.10</p></li></ul></div>

I will explain how to use these three different products, using
small C code examples containing very common errors. I will show
how (and if) each product detects the errors. All three packages
replace the usual memory accessing functions with their own code
and can detect memory problems when they appear. I performed the
tests on my Pentium 133 Linux box with 32MB RAM and the 2.0.34
kernel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f86580.0x207e7c0"></a>A Bit About Installation</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Checker</b></span> comes in the usual
tgz format (gzipped tar file), with a simple installation
procedure. Run the &ldquo;configure&rdquo; script, then
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> all the files. The
installation went fine for me; I didn't see any problems. One note:
you need <span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span> 2.8.1 to use the
latest version of Checker.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Electric Fence</b></span> is available
in binary and source format and requires kernel 1.1.83 or
higher.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mem-Test</b></span> is available in the
tgz format, and it is very simple to build using the provided
Makefile.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f86580.0x207eb30"></a>How They Work</h2></div></div><p>Electric Fence (EF) is a library&mdash;link it to your program,
then run it. EF will cause a segmentation fault on the exact line
of the wrong instruction (not 100 lines after), so by tracking the
program with a debugger, you can get to the root of the problem.
Place an inaccessible memory page after (or before, by using the
correct option) each area allocated by your program, and EF will
cause an immediate error when the program goes out of the
bounds.</p><p>Mem-Test is another library you can simply link to your
object&mdash;just remember to include the header file mem_test_user.h
before. As we will see, this program is a bit different from the
other two, and it detects particular errors. When the program runs,
it creates a log where it stores all memory
allocation/deallocation. By using a Perl script provided in the
package, it will show you the memory leak present in the code.
Since Electric Fence doesn't detect this particular error, it can
be used in conjunction with Mem-Test.</p><p>Checker is also a library and exploits the
<b  >-fcheck-memory-usage</b> option of
<span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span>. A different compiler is
actually used to build your program:
<span   class="bold"><b>checkergcc</b></span>. It is a stub which
calls gcc and compiles the program with its own memory access
libraries. Once the program is compiled, you can run it and checker
will show you a complete report with the errors it found in your
sources. Checker uses a bitmap to store any memory area the program
is using. This bitmap will contain the access right of each memory
area. For example, an area could be write-only (when the variable
is not yet initialized), readable and writable, not accessible and
so on. In this way, it will be able to detect the memory access
error.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f86580.0x207edf0"></a>Example Code</h2></div></div><p>The six pieces of C code we will look at are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>postr.c</b></span>: this code
<a href="3185l1.html" target="_self">(Listing 1)</a> performs a read (with
<span   class="bold"><b>printf</b></span>) of an uninitialized memory
area. The lack of the string terminator (\0) will force the printf
to read after the <span   class="bold"><b>malloc</b></span>
area.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>prer.c</b></span>: this piece
of code <a href="3185l2.html" target="_self">(Listing 2)</a> contains two
errors. The printf is accessing a byte before the allocated area
(the pointer was decremented), then the
<span   class="bold"><b>free</b></span> is done with an address not
returned by malloc.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>postw.c</b></span>: in this
code <a href="3185l3.html" target="_self">(Listing 3)</a>, the
<span   class="bold"><b>strcpy</b></span> is writing 12 bytes (with
the \0) in a 10-byte area. Moreover, the printf is reading the
uninitialized last two bytes.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>prew.c</b></span>: this code
<a href="3185l4.html" target="_self">(Listing 4)</a> is writing before the
allocated memory. The free and the printf will cause an error as in
the previous examples.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>uninit.c</b></span>: this
code <a href="3185l5.html" target="_self">(Listing 5)</a> makes an
assignment to a NULL pointer. This is a common error for
programmers new to the C language.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>unfree.c</b></span>: in this
example <a href="3185l6.html" target="_self">(Listing 6)</a>, I missed
freeing some allocated memory.</p></li></ul></div><p>Post-Read</p><p>To test Checker, I compiled
<a href="3185l1.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
1</b></span></a> with this command line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
checkergcc -o postr postr.c
</pre><p>All the gcc command-line options can be used with Checker.
The compilation went fine, and when I ran
<span   class="bold"><b>postr</b></span>, I got this output:
<pre     class="programlisting">

  pc=0x0804875a in *unknown* at *unknown*:0

</pre>


Checker executed the program and found the problem&mdash;an
uninitialized read at line 17 (the printf line). This was caused by
the lack of a string terminator in the memory area. At first look,
this output seems quite messy, but if you read it carefully, you
will find a lot of information: which type of error it found, where
the memory was allocated (line 10) and where the problem occurs
(line 17).
</p><p>To compile the program with Mem-Test, you must perform a
slight modification to the postr source. Add header file
(<b  >#include&nbsp;"mem_test_user.h"</b>) to wrap the
various memory allocation functions and use a modified version.
Compile the program with the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -o postr postr.c -lmem_test
</pre><p>I added another library (mem_test) to the compilation
command. When you run the postr executable, the new library will
create a file named MEM_TEST_FILE in which all memory accesses and
leaks will be logged. In this particular situation, Mem-Test does
not find a problem because it was built to identify only memory
leaks.
</p><p>For Electric Fence, we need to recompile the program,
including the reference library:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -g -o postr postr.c -lefence
</pre><p>I added the <b  >-g</b> option to include the
debugging information in the executable. This is needed because EF
will cause a segmentation fault exactly at the buggy line, so you
will need to walk through the code to find the exact line causing
the problem. This is the output of the executable:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Electric Fence 2.0.5 Copyright (C) 1987-1995 Bruce Perens. exa
</pre>


EF didn't find any problem in the code, so no errors were
generated.
</p><p>EF has four different switches, which can be enabled by
setting one of these environment variables:
<b  >EF_ALIGNMENT</b>,
<b  >EF_PROTECT_BELOW</b>,
<b  >EF_PROTECT_FREE</b> or
<b  >EF_ALLOW_MALLOC_0</b>.</p><p><b  >EF_ALIGNMENT</b> sets the alignment for each
memory allocation done by malloc (or calloc and realloc). By
default, this size is set to <b  >sizeof(int)</b>,
because this is usually the alignment required by the CPU. This
could be a problem when you allocate a size that is not a multiple
of the word size. Since the inaccessible page must be set to
word-aligned address, you have a hole after the allocated memory to
the inaccessible page. You can fix this by setting the environment
variable to 0; in this way, you will be able to find a single-byte
overrun. This will force malloc to return a non-aligned address,
but this is not a problem in most cases. In some cases (when you
have an odd-size allocation for an object that must be
word-aligned), you will get a bus error (SIGBUS). I never saw a
SIGBUS error using EF (and I used it in real-life programs); I got
this information from the EF documentation.</p><p>EF will usually place the unaccessible page after each memory
allocation. By setting <b  >EF_PROTECT_BELOW</b> to 1, it
will place this page before the allocation, so you can check for
under-runs.</p><p>EF allows you to allocate freed memory. If you think your
program is touching free memory, set
<b  >EF_PROTECT_FREE</b> to 1. EF will not reallocate any
freed memory, and any access will be detected.</p><p>A malloc call with zero bytes is considered an error. If you
need to use such a call, you can tell EF to ignore this error by
making <b  >EF_ALLOW_MALLOC_0</b> non-zero.</p><p>I set <b  >EF_ALIGNMENT</b> to 0 in order to see if
the postr error would be detected, but again EF did not see
it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f86580.0x2478698"></a>Pre-Read</h2></div></div><p>Checker found the problem at the correct line (printf) in
<a href="3185l2.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
2</b></span></a>, and it pointed out the freeing of an address
different from the one returned by malloc. Actually, I decremented
the <b  >foo</b> pointer and tried to free this
address.</p><p>Mem-Test didn't find the problem, but this was
expected.</p><p>If I link the EF library without specifying any switch,
Electric Fence returns only an error regarding the freeing of a
non-malloc returned value:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Electric Fence 2.0.5 Copyright (C) 1987-1995 Bruce Perens.
ElectricFence Aborting: free(400b3ff3): address not from malloc().
Illegal Instruction (core dumped)
</pre><p>Then, I tried to setting the protect below switch:
<pre     class="programlisting">
export EF_PROTECT_BELOW=1
</pre>


With this variable, EF caused a segmentation fault. With gdb, I
tracked down the program to the printf where the segmentation fault
occurred.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f86580.0x2478a60"></a>Post-Write</h2></div></div><p>For <a href="3185l3.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
3</b></span></a>, Checker found the bound violation at line 14
(strcpy). Moreover, it also found an uninitialized data read at
line 16 (printf). Actually, the print is going to read after the
allocated area.</p><p>Mem-Test gave no reports as expected.</p><p>Again, the first run (without any switch) of Electric Fence
did not report any error. I then set
<b  >EF_ALIGNMENT</b> to 0, and the strcpy caused a core
dump.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f86580.0x2478d20"></a>Pre-Write</h2></div></div><p>The error in
<a href="3185l4.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
4</b></span></a> was correctly detected by Checker as the
incorrect free. Mem-Test gave no reports. When I didn't set a
switch, Electric Fence detected only the wrong free, but with
<b  >EF_PROTECT_BELOW</b> set, it also found the
pre-write.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f86580.0x2478f30"></a>Uninitialized Pointer</h2></div></div><p>Checker found the exact line in
<a href="3185l5.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
5</b></span></a> where the bad assignment was made. No reports
were expected or created by Mem-Test. There was a core dump, but
the log was not created. Electric Fence did not detect this error.
When you run the program, you will get a core dump whether you use
EF or not.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f86580.0x24790e8"></a>Unfreed Memory</h2></div></div><p>By default, Checker does not find memory leaks. The
documentation shows several switches you can set to modify the
checking. Different switches are set by defining the environment
variable <b  >CHECKEROPTS</b>. The more interesting
options are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >-o=<i><tt>file</tt></i></b>:
redirect the output to a file.</p></li><li><p><b  >-d=<i><tt>xx</tt></i></b>:
disable a type of memory access error.</p></li><li><p><b  ><i><tt>-D=end</tt></i></b>:
do leak detection at the end of the program.</p></li><li><p><b  ><i><tt>-m=x</tt></i></b>:
define the behavior for a malloc(0).</p></li></ul></div><p>I ran <b  >export CHECKEROPTS="-D=end"</b> and then
recompiled. Now it found the memory leak of 50 bytes in
<a href="3185l6.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
6</b></span></a>. Checker implements a garbage detector to find
out this type of error. You can call it by setting this option or
by calling a specific Checker function inside your program.
</p><p>Mem-Test easily identifies the memory leak, with a clear
report:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
50 bytes of memory left allocated at 134524624
134524624 was last touched by licalloc at line 12 of unfree.c
</pre><p>Electric Fence returned no messages.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f86580.0x2479a88"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>From these tests, it appears clear that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Checker</em></span> is a complete product which found all
the errors without any problems. It is quite easy to use, and you
don't have to set a lot of switches because, by default, it checks
for a wide range of errors. It does have a little problem when you
use external libraries and functions (such as the GDBM). Actually,
to ensure it will check for everything, you should recompile all
the external programs with it. If you call a function not compiled
with it, the memory bitmap used to track the memory accesses will
not be updated; this will create holes in your checks. You have two
ways to do this: recompile the library with checkergcc, or create
function stubs. The stubs are particular aliases for each function,
which perform some checks on the parameters passed to and returned
from the function. In particular, you must check for pointers to
see if the memory area you will access by using them has the
correct status (readable, writable, etc.).</p><p>Provided in the package are many ready-to-use stubs for the
most popular functions (such as
<span   class="bold"><b>stdio</b></span> and the string functions).
After a look at these stubs, it should not be difficult to write
your own for libraries you cannot recompile with checkergcc.</p><p>On the other hand, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Electric Fence</em></span> showed
some hesitation in error detection but is easier to use. It is
enough to link it to the program and run it (no problem with
external libraries). If used in tandem with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mem-Test</em></span>, it will also detect memory leaks.
For best results, be careful with the switches: use the correct
spelling and the correct alignment and protect (below or after the
memory allocation).</p><p><a href="3185s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
