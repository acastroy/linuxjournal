    Follow the development of speech algorithms for digital
    radios through the complete project life cycle.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2873580.0x296b450"></a></h2></div></div><p>In this article, I describe a Linux
success story based on researching and developing DSP (Digital
Signal Processing) speech coding algorithms. I chose Linux over
Windows for good reasons&mdash;reasons that may provide you with
ammunition to persuade the bosses that Linux really does mean
business. To emphasize this, I developed the software for the next
generation of digital radio products in the headquarters of the
world's largest private mobile radio manufacturer.
</p><p>Luckily, I had an open-minded boss, but there were still
difficulties. These included interoperability issues with existing
systems, resource sharing, accessibility, documentation and the
non-availability of some crucial software for Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2873580.0x296b5b0"></a>Project Life Cycle</h2></div></div><p>A typical project life cycle begins with university research
and proceeds through initial investigation and prototyping, a
complex coding route and various testing stages to a fully
documented software package for passing on to system
integrators.</p><p>My project was advanced speech processing software for
fixed-point DSP. Bearing this in mind, audio capabilities topped
the list of requirements for any development machine. Also needed
were good mathematical processing and visualization software and a
whole set of code-development tools. Finally, some DSP-specific
software was required.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2873580.0x296b710"></a>Research</h2></div></div><p>Given recorded speech files, research often involves
processing and evaluating the changes by listening to them. For
this, a sound card is useful, and with the availability of the OSS
drivers, sound output is no problem for Linux. The easiest way to
generate sound is to copy a sound data file to /dev/audio.
Tradition specifies this data file should be in Sun's 8-bit
logarithmic format, sampled at 8KHz. The command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cp audiofile.au /dev/audio
</pre><p>outputs sound, assuming everything is set up properly (see
Resources for good audio information).
</p><p>How do you get Sun format audio? The answer is to use
<span   class="bold"><b>sox</b></span> (SOund eXchange). Its
command-line options seem a bit unfriendly at first, but the
following command converts a .wav file into a Sun format .au
file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sox audiofile.wav -t ul -r 8000 audiofile.au
</pre><p>Traditional processing is done by writing a C or similar
program to read in the speech file, perform some processing and
write the output either directly to /dev/audio (if the program can
output the data in real time) or to a temporary file first (if it
cannot). This works okay, but the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>compile-link-test-modify</em></span> cycle can be too
lengthy to permit efficient trial-and-error testing (sometimes
called research).
</p><p>One alternative is <span   class="bold"><b>MATLAB</b></span>,
the excellent commercial mathematical manipulation package;
however, I found an alternative with a
GPL&mdash;<span   class="bold"><b>Rlab</b></span>. Although not promoted
as a MATLAB clone, this high-quality suite of software is at least
as usable, truly multi-platform and free. The range of built-in
functions in Rlab is impressive and allows the seamless addition of
user functions. Data can be imported/exported, processed and
displayed graphically, as shown in Figure 1. See Resources for some
useful additional Rlab functions, including an audio playback
routine.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3266f1.large.jpg"><img src="3266f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Using Rlab to Modify and Plot Speech Waveforms

</p></div></div><p>All this gives us an ideal platform for speech algorithm
research. We can listen to audio, make modifications and build up a
library of speech processing routines to use in current and future
investigations. The modifications can be tried and evaluated with
little effort.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2873580.0x296bd98"></a>Prototyping</h2></div></div><p>Now the algorithms found after playing with Rlab must be
converted manually to DSP code. This isn't actually easy for a
number of reasons: the Rlab code makes use of built-in library
routines and is floating-point. The humble DSP is only fixed-point,
so normally this conversion is done in three steps.</p><p>The first is to go directly from the Rlab script to
C&mdash;replicating all the Rlab functions with C functions of the same
name, which you write and test, and rewriting the glue code. This
produces an executable that is bit-exact with the Rlab code, so
halting or single-stepping the code with
<span   class="bold"><b>gdb</b></span> can allow direct comparisons
between the C and the Rlab script.</p><p>The second step is to replace all the floating-point
variables and functions with fixed-point alternatives. For each
data variable, we need to know maximum and minimum values and the
effect of truncation, then truncate and scale appropriately.</p><p>For trigonometric functions, a number of established
techniques such as approximation and table lookup may be used, but
these can be difficult to code. It doesn't help that DSP memory is
extremely limited and the law of code size applies (i.e., code size
will expand until it's just larger than the available
space).</p><p>However, fiddling with numbers can be good fun, and trying to
write a fixed-point <span   class="bold"><b>log</b></span> function
by hand may require a few more visits to Rlab in order to work out
exactly what a logarithm does.</p><p>Eventually, a C program emerges that has no floating-point
variables (use <span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span> to make sure);
other than scaling and truncation errors, it performs the same
function as the original Rlab code. Again, gdb can be used to
investigate execution. We can import array data to Rlab for
plotting by selecting the data and dropping it into an Rlab
script.</p><p>One trick is to write a C function that, when passed an
array, prints the array formatted so that it can be selected and
pasted into Rlab&mdash;code such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
void rprint(int length, int *array) {
   printf("\narray=[");
   for (int i=0;i&lt;length;i++)
      printf("%d,",array[i]);
   printf("\b];\nplot(array)\n"); }
</pre><p>When used frequently in the debugging cycle, this can be very
effective.
</p><p>The last point to mention under prototyping is the benefit of
using some form of version control, or perhaps I should say the
foolishness of not using it. Effective version control is one of
the major reasons UNIX/Linux is a stable and capable development
platform. We used RCS throughout the development process. In fact,
the main RCS directory was on a Sun accessed via an NFS mount and
shared by a number of developers working under Solaris.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2873580.0x296c2c0"></a>Development</h2></div></div><p>Now comes the DSP involvement&mdash;for this a DSP starter kit is
needed. For simple and easy development, two main contenders are
available. Both have patchy support for Linux, cost in the region
of &pound;80 and are aimed at the hobbyist, small business or
university user.</p><p>The original was from Texas Instruments, the TMS320C50 DSK
(there was an earlier, less powerful C26 board), with the newer
contender being the Analog Devices ADSP2181 EZ-KIT Lite. Both have
audio I/O&mdash;the latter has 16-bit CD-quality stereo audio, while the
former can manage only 14-bit voice quality. On the software side,
both provide a nice set of DOS executables&mdash;assembler, linker and
(for the Analog Devices kit) a simulator. The ADSP has an edge with
its assembly language syntax being much more user-friendly than the
TI chip. I won't stick my neck out too far and comment on which DSP
is more powerful&mdash;both are fairly competent.</p><p>Linux versions of most DSP development tools are floating
around on the Internet, but some are still missing, notably for the
ADSP2181. These omissions are the assembler, linker and simulator,
which is a pity since I had to use the ADSP.</p><p>The freely available cross-assembler
<span   class="bold"><b>as</b></span> will soon include
ADSP21<span   class="emphasis"><em>xx</em></span> compatibility. It already handles
TMS320C<span   class="emphasis"><em>xx</em></span> code along with a staggeringly wide
array of other processors, with more added whenever the author,
Alfred Arnold, has free time. Analog Devices have been approached
about providing Linux versions of assembler and linker, but stated
they do not currently have plans to support Linux.</p><p>For DSP code development, we need an assembler, linker and a
code downloader that sends an executable through the PC serial port
to the DSP development board. For the
ADSP21<span   class="emphasis"><em>xx</em></span>, few Linux tools are available just
now, only the downloader.</p><p>The solution is to use DOSEMU, the Linux DOS emulator, which
has an impressive feature called the
<span   class="bold"><b>dexe</b></span> (directly executable DOS
application). This is basically a single DOS file or application in
a tiny DOS disc image that can be executed within Linux without the
user being aware that it is actually a DOS program.</p><p>To use this method, the entire ADSP21<span   class="emphasis"><em>xx</em></span>
tool set can be incorporated into a single .dexe file. With a
little ingenuity, a few simple shell scripts and batch files, the
user will never know the assembler and linker he is using are
actually DOS programs (see Resources for a HOWTO).</p><p>With the newly created dexe, we now have an assembler and a
linker for our DSP code. Hidden in the depths of the Analog Devices
web site is the source code for a UNIX (Linux/Sun) download monitor
to load the DSP executable into the EZ-KIT Lite through the PC
serial port. This means the assembler source can be compiled and
downloaded all (more or less) under Linux.</p><p>The one irritation is the simulator. Analog Devices supply a
DOS version of their simulator which will not run under the
emulator, but this is no reason to throw Linux out, as we shall see
later.</p><p>Analog Devices does have a 21<span   class="emphasis"><em>xx</em></span> C
compiler based on good old <span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span> and
even released the source. The C code integrates neatly with the
assembly language and speeds up development time, but it is quite
inefficient both in terms of code size and instruction
cycles.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2873580.0x296c9a0"></a>Completion</h2></div></div><p>We now have an algorithm that runs on a DSP system. The
complete software package generated by this effort includes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Rlab research and investigation scripts</p></li><li><p>Test vectors and speech files from Rlab</p></li><li><p>Floating-point C implementation</p></li><li><p>Fixed-point C implementation</p></li><li><p>Assembly language version of the code</p></li><li><p>A working DSP executable</p></li></ul></div><p>Does this list look complete to you? If so, you must be a
born programmer like me. Anyone else would realize that
documentation is missing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2873580.0x2d651c8"></a>Documentation</h2></div></div><p>Has this happened to you? When your management says
documentation must be in a standard format, you think
<span   class="bold"><b>LaTeX</b></span> and they think Microsoft
Word. ASCII is insufficient because of the lack of text formatting
and graphics support.</p><p>However, one irrefutable standard that even your boss can
agree to is HTML. Once a common standard has been agreed upon, it
is time to produce a set of documentation templates. After that,
any editor can be used to add content, including Netscape
<span   class="bold"><b>composer</b></span>, Emacs or even Word.
Graphics are more of a problem, but a combination of
<span   class="bold"><b>xfig</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>GIMP</b></span> can handle most situations.
The resulting web documentation can be read under Linux, Windows,
RISC OS, etc. and is even accessible on palmtop computers.</p><p>We used RCS to manage our documentation versions too, in
order to comply with company quality control standards. This allows
a construct such as <b  >&lt;li&gt;RCS id:
$Id$&lt;/li&gt;</b> to be embedded in the HTML. When the HTML
document is checked into RCS, the RCS identifier will be inserted
between the &ldquo;$&rdquo; symbols and will therefore be displayed on the
HTML page.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3266f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. RCS Information Used in Inter/Intranet-Based
Documentation
</p></div></div><p>A prettier method is to use JavaScript for display in
Netscape to format the page and remove the unwanted $ symbols. The
HTML page in Listing 1 forms the front cover to some code
documentation, as shown in Figure 2.</p><p><a href="3266l1.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
1.</b></span></a></p><p>We all know HTML isn't perfect, but at least it is a
compromise that can be agreed upon in striving toward a paperless
office. Some other features we incorporated were placing the RCS
log entries into a scrollable text area on the HTML pages and
judicious use of hyperlinks to commented source code, data flow
diagrams and flow charts.</p><p>To enhance our documentation, the C prototype code was
compiled using <b  >GCC -pg</b> which inserts extra code
to write a profiling information file during program execution.
Then <span   class="bold"><b>gprof</b></span> was used to interpret
this profiling information. <span   class="bold"><b>xfig</b></span>
was used to manually convert this into a function-call, graph GIF,
and a sensitive image map was created for it. A set of HTML
templates was created and edited to document each function; these
pages can be accessed by clicking on this top-level GIF.</p><p>The result was a single HTML page showing the entire code in
a pyramidal layer structure starting from
<span   class="bold"><b>main</b></span> and the calling links between
each function, with passed variable names written next to each
calling link. The functions were named inside clickable boxes,
which pointed to an explanation of that function.</p><p>This HTML documentation process is now being automated; see
Resources for more information.</p><p>As an added bonus, my colleagues used the new documentation
standard to justify buying more Linux machines. One was used to
serve the documents on the company intranet using the Apache web
server. This system can control access to the documents on a
need-to-know basis, and keep a log of user accesses versus date and
document version. It is even possible to automatically notify
affected parties by e-mail when a document they accessed recently
has changed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2873580.0x2d65b68"></a>Alternatives</h2></div></div><p>Finally, let's consider the alternatives to Linux. The Analog
Devices tools supplied with the EZ-KIT all run under DOS and are
command-line programs. Of course, they could be run from a Windows
DOS prompt, but this provides no advantage over Linux. Furthermore,
an xterm is more flexible than a Windows DOS prompt, especially
when you want to refer back to a page of error messages that
flashed past. Also, the ADSP21<span   class="emphasis"><em>xx</em></span> simulator
will not run under Windows, which would have to be rebooted cleanly
into DOS, just as a Linux machine that needed to run the simulator
would.</p><p>UNIX versions of the tools are supplied by Analog Devices at
extra cost and are functionally identical to the DOS versions.
However, they run only under SunOS; they do not run under newer
versions of Solaris.</p><p>MATLAB is available for Linux, other UNIX systems and
Windows, as is Rlab, but I would argue that only the flexibility of
a UNIX operating system can allow the full use of these
applications to interact with other command-line-based code
development and debugging tools. Of course, debugging tools are
available for all platforms. They may sometimes be more user
friendly, but are probably less capable than gdb and are seldom
freely available.</p><p>Revision control systems are also available for many
platforms, but not all can cope with code development and integrate
with a hyperlinked HTML-based documentation system being served via
Apache. The revision control system you choose must also have the
capability to interface with your favourite editor and be utilized
within the <span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> hierarchy.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2873580.0x2d65e28"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>Obviously, Linux makes a good DSP development system. All you
need to buy is a DSP starter kit&mdash;everything else is on your
installation CD or freely downloadable. This system has been used
in the real world&mdash;it takes a little setting up, but it works. It
is reliable and a lot more fun than Windows.</p><p>In the future, it will only get better: more DSP development
tools will be available under Linux. I encourage you all to
advocate the use of Linux-based development systems for both
university and corporate research and development.</p><p><a href="3266s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
