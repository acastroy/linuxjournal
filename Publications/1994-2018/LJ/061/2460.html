    The dialog command enables the use of window boxes in shell
    scripts to make their use more interactive.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1625580.0x171d4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Shell scripts are text files containing
commands for the shell and are frequently used to handle repetitive
tasks. In order to avoid typing the same commands over and over
again, we put them in a file with a few modifications, give it
execute permission and run it.
</p><p>To control the program at run-time, an interactive shell
script is needed. For this case, the
<span   class="bold"><b>dialog</b></span> command offers an easy way
to draw text-mode colored windows. These windows can contain text
boxes, message boxes or different kinds of menus. There are even
ways of using input from the user to modify the script
behaviour.</p><p>The current version of the dialog program is cdialog-0.9 and
can be freely downloaded from Sunsite's /pub/Linux/utils/shell
directory. Dialog uses the ncurses library, so it too must be
installed. Some Linux distributions (i.e., Slackware) include the
dialog program because of utilities which rely on it
(<span   class="bold"><b>setup</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>pkgtool</b></span>). By the way, these
utilities are great examples of using dialog.</p><p>Let's examine the dialog version of the most popular example
program around. With your favorite text editor, create a file named
hello containing these lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
# First shell script with "dialog"
dialog --title "Dialog message box" \
       --msgbox "\n Hello world !" 6 25
</pre><p>The first line of this file identifies it as a shell script
for the &ldquo;sh&rdquo; shell. Every shell script must start with the
characters &ldquo;#!&rdquo; followed by the name (and path) of the shell to
execute. For example, we could have written this line as
<b  >#!/bin/bash</b>. The next line is just a comment,
like any line starting with &ldquo;#&rdquo; other than the first line in the
file. Then comes the dialog command, which will draw a message box
6 lines high and 25 columns wide on the screen, containing the
title &ldquo;Dialog message box&rdquo; and the message &ldquo;Hello world !&rdquo;. The
message box has an OK button and when it is selected, the script
will end. Notice the general format of the
<b  >--msgbox</b> option:
<pre     class="programlisting">
--msgbox
</pre>


After writing and saving this file, type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod a+x hello
</pre>


=&ldquo;./2460f1.gif&rdquo;
Figure 1. Screenshot of a Dialog Box
</p><p>The resulting screen is shown in Figure 1. This example is so
simple it could have been produced with just one command at the
shell prompt. However, things get more complicated when user input
is needed in a shell script.</p><p>For example, to list the contents of a directory, use dialog
as shown in <a href="2460l1.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
1</b></span></a>. This introduces two new dialog boxes: an
input and a text box. The input box has the general format:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
--inputbox
</pre><p>In Listing 1, the default value displayed in the input box is
obtained by running the command
<span   class="bold"><b>pwd</b></span> which returns the present
working directory. Whenever a command is enclosed in reverse
quotes, bash replaces it with its standard output.
</p><p>Of course, this default value can be changed at runtime using
the backspace key to delete and regular letter keys to write. The
final value is printed by dialog on STDERR. In order to use it from
the shell script, it must first be redirected to a file. Do this
with the redirection:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
2&gt;/tmp/dialog.ans
</pre><p>The next line is necessary in case the user decides to select
the Cancel button in the input box. When that happens, the exit
status of the dialog command will be 1. Bash keeps the exit status
of the last executed command in the variable
<b  >$?</b>, so if this is 1, the shell script will stop
after clearing the screen.
</p><p>If <b  >$?</b> is 0 (the user clicked the OK
button), the answer file is read to set the variable ANS. Again,
reverse quoting proves useful. Another method of doing this is to
use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ANS=$(cat /tmp/dialog.ans)
</pre><p>The contents of the chosen directory are output to the same
file used before. This can be done safely, because the &gt;
operator overwrites the previous contents of this file.
</p><p>All is now set for the next dialog command, which generates
the text box to display the contents of a text file. It has the
general format:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
--textbox
</pre><p>The text box allows navigating with the arrow keys or
home/end/pgup/pgdown keys and even has simple searching facilities.
Typing / while the text box is displayed causes another window to
appear, which prompts the user for a string to be searched forward
in the file. Typing ? performs reverse searching, just as for the
<span   class="bold"><b>less</b></span> pager. The first line
containing the string is displayed at the top of the text box.
</p><p>The experienced programmer might complain about an obvious
flaw in this shell script. What if the directory name is wrong? The
shell script will not complain, but will show an empty text box
since there are no files in a nonexistent directory. To solve this
problem, a check is made to see if the specified directory exists.
Actually, the <span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> command returns
an exit status of 0 if the directory exists, and 1 if it doesn't.
Thus, the script can be modified by adding these lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ls -al $ANS &gt; /tmp/dialog.ans 2&gt;/dev/null
if [ $? = 1 ]; then
   clear
   echo no such directory
   exit 1
fi
</pre><p>First, the ls line is changed, redirecting standard error to
/dev/null. This means no error messages from ls will appear on the
screen. Then, if the exit status (<b  >$?</b>) is 1, the
script will exit with an error message.
</p><p>This script can be made even more useful by allowing the user
to examine more directories before the script exits. (See
<a href="2460l2.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
2</b></span></a>.) A few changes have been made. First, the
entire script has been included in a <b  >while-do</b>
loop which is always true. This allows it to run more than once.
Now the only way of exiting the script (besides typing ctrl-c) is
by selecting the Cancel button in the dialog input box. The second
change is the introduction of a message box which will be displayed
when the ls command returns an exit status of 1. The command
<span   class="bold"><b>continue</b></span> deserves a special
comment. Its meaning is to skip the current iteration of the
<b  >while</b> loop (i.e., the part which shows the text
box) and start a new one. Thus, after the error message, the user
will again see the input box, prompting for another directory
name.</p><p>The menu box is produced by running dialog with the
<b  >--menu</b> option with the format:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dialog --menu
   <span   class="emphasis"><em>tag2</em></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>item2</em></span>...
</pre><p>This option displays a box with two buttons (OK and Cancel)
and a menu consisting of one or more lines. Each line has a &ldquo;tag&rdquo;
(a number or word) and an &ldquo;item&rdquo;, which is usually text
describing the menu entry. When a user selects an item and then
clicks on the OK button, the corresponding tag is printed on
STDERR. Also, the exit status of dialog is 0 for the OK button
being selected and 1 for the Cancel button.
</p><p>Menu boxes are useful in that they allow the user to choose
from several fixed alternatives. For example, when producing a
LaTeX document, three steps must be taken: editing the source file
with a word processor, compiling it with LaTeX and viewing the
resulting .dvi file. It is easy to build a shell script to do these
steps. (See <a href="2460l3.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
3</b></span></a> which assumes the text editor is
<span   class="bold"><b>jed</b></span>, the .dvi file viewer is
<span   class="bold"><b>dvisvga</b></span> and both are in the path.)
The complete script is again included in a &ldquo;while&rdquo; loop for the
purpose of making it work more than one time. The only way to exit
this script is by selecting the &ldquo;Cancel&rdquo; button in the first menu
box. Otherwise, the user has to choose between three
alternatives:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Edit a text file.</p></li><li><p>Compile a LaTeX file.</p></li><li><p>View a .dvi file.</p></li></ul></div><p>The answer is stored in the file /tmp/ans and retrieved in
the variable <b  >R</b>. If the user chooses to edit a
file, a new dialog box appears. It is an input box and prompts for
a file name. The answer goes into the variable
<b  >F</b>. Then the script checks whether the file
exists and runs the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
jed $F # where $F is the name of the file
</pre>


If the file does not exist, it is either a new one or a typing
error. To distinguish between these two possibilities, a yes/no
dialog box is provided. The general format of such a box is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
--yesno
</pre>


The box has two buttons, YES and NO. The text is usually a
question, which the user answers by selecting a button. If YES,
<b  >$?</b> (the exit status of the dialog command) is 0;
if NO, <b  >$?</b> is 1.
</p><p>In Listing 3, if the answer is YES, the text editor is
invoked; if NO, the script returns to the main menu through the
continue command. The other two choices work in the same way, the
only difference being the commands for processing the file with
LaTeX or for viewing the resulting DVI file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
latex $F
dvisvga $F
</pre><p>Several other dialog boxes are available, such as the
checklist or the radiolist; however, their use is quite similar to
that of the menu box.
</p><p>I would like to end with an example of the
<b  >--guage</b> dialog box. This is used to graphically
display a percentage. The syntax is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dialog --guage
</pre><p>Once started, the guage box keeps reading percent values from
STDIN until an EOF is reached and changes the display accordingly.
Here is a simple (but not very useful) guage script:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
{ for I in 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 \
      80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0; do
   echo $I
   sleep 1
done
echo; } | dialog --guage "A guage demo" 6 70 0
</pre>


Copy this into a file, give it execute permission, run and enjoy!
The first part of the script (included in braces) is a group
command. Every second it sends one of the listed values to the
guage dialog box. The final echo command is used to terminate the
dialog box.
</p><p>Shell scripting is a convenient way of making your Linux
system &ldquo;smarter&rdquo;. These examples of the most common dialog boxes
should help you make your scripts more attractive.</p><p><a href="2460s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
