Java and concluded that its GUI development toolkit wasn't quite
ready for prime time, it's time to look again.
</p><p>The Java Foundation Classes (JFC) introduced with Java
Version 1.2 bring Java forward to the point where it can easily
compete head-on with Motif and MFC for professional GUI
development. If you already know the Java language, JFC can beat
both Motif and MFC hands down for ease of programming. In this
article, I will show code that was developed &ldquo;by hand&rdquo; using just
<span   class="emphasis"><em>vi</em></span> and the Java Development Kit (JDK). Many
higher-level development tools and GUI builders are available to
make this job even easier.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f0580.0x24e86b8"></a>What are Java and AWT?</h2></div></div><p>Portability is one of the holy grails of system designers.
The UCSD Pascal System of 1980 compiled into portable P-Code that
could be interpreted on most of the microcomputer systems common in
its day. The C language and the UNIX operating system Linux is
based upon both became popular because they could run on a variety
of platforms. The latest newcomer is Java. Java programs compile
from source code into &ldquo;byte code&rdquo;, a portable and compact machine
representation of the executable statements the programmer
wrote.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f0580.0x24e87c0"></a>Java Continues from C and C++</h2></div></div><p>C and C++ are well-known languages in the developer
community. To help developers come up to speed quickly and easily,
Java borrows most of the syntax of C and quite a bit of the syntax
of C++. All the basic syntax operators such as +, -, *=, (), {} and
others work. For C programmers who wish to understand Java's OO
syntax, think of objects as
<span   class="bold"><b>struct</b></span>s with functions associated
with them. Note that all methods (functions) are part of objects,
so the syntax</p><pre     class="programlisting">
objectName.function(args);
</pre><p>is normally used. One of the most notable differences from C
is the lack of pointers, <span   class="bold"><b>malloc</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>free</b></span>.
</p><p>Pointers were necessary in the days when we needed to access
words in particular locations in memory, but have led to a lot of
unreadable and hard-to-maintain code. The functions
<span   class="emphasis"><em>malloc</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>free</em></span> provide C
with a low-level paradigm for allocating and freeing memory. Java
does away with both; since Java programs are compiled for the Java
Virtual Machine, in which the addresses are unknown at compile
time, there are no pointers. This has the beneficial side effect of
ruling out viruses based on jumping into the BIOS or system
disk-formatting routines; no syntax is present in the language or
in the underlying virtual machine for referring to a particular
location in real memory.</p><p>As in C++, allocation of memory is handled by the operator
<span   class="bold"><b>new</b></span>, which is similar to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>malloc</em></span> but can be used only to allocate
objects and arrays. Freeing of memory, however, is automatic; no
free or delete is available, and memory is reclaimed by a &ldquo;garbage
collector&rdquo; routine at runtime. Sounds like it gives you less
control, but if you write C, you probably don't bemoan the fact
that local variables are allocated and freed when you enter and
leave a function. Java simply extends this notion to arrays and
objects, which makes for more reliable programs.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int foo() {
int i;   i is allocated "someplace" in
         memory (or register)
         do something with i
}        i is automatically reclaimed
</pre><p>Java is an object-oriented language in the traditions of C++
and Smalltalk. Java eliminates a few C++ operators, but experienced
C++ programmers have little trouble upgrading their skills to the
new language.
</p><p>Instead of C++'s multiple inheritance, Java provides
&ldquo;interfaces&rdquo; with multiple inheritance of specification but not
implementation. This may be more powerful than C++, since it allows
multiple views on an object; that is, a class can implement several
interfaces and can be passed by any of those type names, exposing
only the methods known to objects implementing that interface. This
can provide greater type safety than traditional C++ multiple
inheritance.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f0580.0x24e8d98"></a>A Complete Environment</h2></div></div><p>If it's a complete programming environment you want, Java has
it. Instead of using the native C library, for example, Java
programs use classes and methods in
<span   class="bold"><b>java.lang</b></span>, the package of classes
for Java language features. One example is String&mdash;normal quoted
strings like &ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo; compile to String objects, and the
String class has methods such as
<span   class="bold"><b>compareTo</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>equals</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>substring</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>startsWith</b></span>/<span   class="bold"><b>endsWith</b></span>,
etc. No more worry about <span   class="bold"><b>bcmp</b></span>
versus <span   class="bold"><b>memcmp</b></span>; Java provides a
single set of methods that works everywhere. AWT, which is the
subject of most of this article, provides a portable Graphical User
Interface layer. Java.util is a package of utility routines such as
random numbers, collection classes and others.</p><p>In today's global village, it's important that software be
able to function in any locale. Internationalization is basic to
&ldquo;Java, the programming language for the Internet&rdquo;. Strings and
characters are therefore 16-bit Unicode rather than 8-bit ASCII,
which is not too surprising (see http://www.unicode.org/). What may
surprise you is that Java identifiers can be written in Unicode
characters, so that programmers in any language can write
identifiers which make sense to them (assuming they have a way of
typing the characters).</p><p>If it is database access you want, Java provides the Java
Database Connectivity (JDBC) to access relational databases. It's
patterned loosely on Microsoft ODBC, but operates at a somewhat
higher level. There is even a bridge to ODBC, so you can access an
ODBC database even if a Java driver is not yet available for it.
(See &ldquo;Database Connectivity Using Java&rdquo; by Manu Konchady,
<i  >LJ</i> November 1998.)</p><p>To meet the needs of rapid application development, JavaBeans
supports composition of programs out of reusable components in GUI
builders. Not just the GUI's arrangement but the entire application
can, in many cases, be &ldquo;written&rdquo; by visually indicating the
relationship between events such as a button press and software
components such as spreadsheets, graphing Beans or HTML viewers.
Since the ActiveX market didn't grow as expected, many ActiveX
developers are converting their components into portable JavaBeans.
And since Beans and applications based on them can run on any UNIX,
Linux or *BSD system, this can be only good news for Linux
developers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f0580.0x24e92c0"></a>Open and Free Technology?</h2></div></div><p>But isn't Java proprietary? Well, although Sun invented Java
and many of the pieces of technology that accompany it, it can be
called an &ldquo;open&rdquo; technology. Old-timers will remember how Sun
dominated the UNIX distributed file system by making its NFS a
public specification, even giving away the source for the RPC and
XDR layers that underlie NFS. From the beginning, the specification
of the Java language and the specification and format of the
compiled class files have been publicly available and the source
code of the public API has been included with the
freely-downloadable JDK. The source for everything&mdash;compiler,
runtime interpreter and the internal parts of the API&mdash;has been
available for free under a non-disclosure agreement that permits
free redistribution of binaries. Without this, there would most
likely not be a Java for Linux, SunOS4.1 or *BSD. In fact, there
are several: JDK ports, Kaffe ports and others. Further, the
licensing is designed to encourage the &ldquo;open API&rdquo; concept. Read
this extract from Clause 2 of the JDK license, which every Java
developer who uses Sun's JDK or any derivative must agree
to:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>In the event that Licensee creates any
Java-related API and distributes such API to others for applet or
application development, Licensee must promptly publish an accurate
specification for such API for free use by all developers of
Java-based software.</p></blockquote></div><p>Because of this, members of the free software community have
responded as enthusiastically to Java as they did to Linux. Several
free compilers, at least one free interpreter and many free
libraries are available. Even commercial companies are making some
libraries free. A good place to explore Java freeware (and payware)
is Gamelan (pronounced Gamma-LOHN), at http://www.developer.com/.
My own contributions include Jabadex, a Rolodex-like application, a
set of X Color names (Java's AWT has only 13 named colors) and
others (see http://www.darwinsys.com/freeware/).
</p><p>Most recently, Sun announced easier licensing&mdash;the Sun
Community Source License&mdash;presumably patterned after the Mozilla
license. It's not the BSD Copyright or the GPL, but it's a step
closer. See http:java.sun.com/ and look for licensing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f0580.0x24e9528"></a>AWT&mdash;A Windowing Toolkit</h2></div></div><p>Java's developers wanted everything about Java to be
portable, including how to deal with the X Window System, MS
Windows, Macintosh and other window systems. The Abstract Window
Toolkit is the solution they provide. Instead of starting by
writing components that work everywhere, they wrote a library of
GUI components that is a least common denominator to what the big
three systems offer. It used the underlying native components on
each platform, so that it would &ldquo;look and feel&rdquo; like a native
application. This is an important aspect of user acceptance&mdash;if
users have to learn a whole new GUI just to use your software, they
probably won't bother. This approach limited what you could do with
the early versions of Java's AWT, but with more recent versions,
this is no longer true. The JFC components bring Java to the
forefront of fully functional GUI development environments.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f0580.0x24e9630"></a>JFC = AWT + 2-D + Swing + Accessibility</h2></div></div><p>Java has been increasing in popularity since its first public
release in 1995. Version 1.0 incorporated the Applet API, a basic
window toolkit (AWT) and numerous other APIs. Version 1.1, released
in the fall of 1996, added a tremendous amount of new functionality
including internationalization, better coupling between GUI
controls and their action-handling code, text formatting and
hundreds of new classes. JDK1.2 has just been released at the time
of this writing (January 1999). Version 1.2 of the JDK, which is
also being called &ldquo;Java 2&rdquo;, includes the Java Foundation Classes
(JFC). JFC includes the Swing GUI classes which are the focus of
this article, some accessibility features to make computing usage
easier for persons with various disadvantages, the 2-D graphics
package and the original AWT.</p><p>The 2-D graphics can be thought of as PostScript for Java. If
you've done any PostScript, you'll know it is really two things: a
scripting language and a marking engine. Since Java already
provides a powerful programming language, the 2-D developers needed
to provide only the &ldquo;marking engine&rdquo; (putting marks on paper),
transforms, composites and other fancy graphics and a much-expanded
set of fonts. However, it is implemented in a backward-compatible
way: a Graphics2D object is subclassed from a Graphics object. This
provides Java developers and users with all the fancy graphics
capabilities invented over a decade of desktop publishing, all in a
platform-independent way.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f0580.0x24e9790"></a>We've Got Swing!</h2></div></div><p>The Swing Set portion of JFC is named after the musical style
which revolutionized popular music in the 1940's with such greats
as Duke Ellington (Hint: a penguin-like creature named Duke is
Java's mascot and logo). Swing has many features, including:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Customizable look and feel</p></li><li><p>More choice items, ComboBoxes, etc.</p></li><li><p>More layout managers, panels with borders,

</p><p>Java 1.1's look and feel was that of the underlying operating
system. On Motif, its menus and buttons look like Motif widgets; on
MS Windows, they look like Microsoft widgets; on the Macintosh,
like Macintosh widgets. They truly are the native platform's
widgets. Using a Java interface called &ldquo;Peers&rdquo;, a 1.1 program
constructs and uses native toolkit components, but the developer
never has to think about it. You simply write in terms of AWT
components.</p><p>After 1.1 had been in use for a while, somebody at JavaSoft
decided to poll the developers. Apparently 50% were happy with the
status quo, another 30% favored a platform-independent look and
feel, while the remaining 20% wanted to be able to provide their
own corporate look and feel, to be the same across all platforms.
The Swing set UIFactory was the result. All Swing components have a
settable look and feel. The look and feel is provided by a combined
View-Controller object generated by a class called UIFactory.
UIFactory is powerful&mdash;it can make up and apply new UI objects on
the fly, resulting in programs that can change their look and feel
on demand. Our demo program (see below) has a button that lets you
choose between several &ldquo;look-and-feel&rdquo; styles. The Motif
emulation is included in the JDK. The &ldquo;Metal&rdquo; style is a crisper
look developed by JavaSoft. Implementations of the proprietary
look-and-feel of MS Windows 95 and the Macintosh UI are available,
but only on those platforms (for licensing, not technical,
reasons).</p><p>When you switch, the entire UI is repainted in the new look
without losing any of the choices you have made so far. It is quite
an impressive operation. Other look-and-feel classes such as an
OPEN LOOK or NextStep are also possible, even probable. The only
downside I have seen to Swing is its performance. Don't expect
Swing applications to be quite as snappy as native C/C++
Motif/MS-Windows/Macintosh applications, particularly in startup
time. Once the application is up, though, Swing applications run
acceptably fast on modern computers with adequate memory.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f0580.0x28e2640"></a>Simple Applications</h2></div></div><p>Java can be used to create many kinds of programs. One of the
first to garner widespread attention was Web Applets, which
dynamically extend the behaviour of the web browser by being
embedded in a web page. Java can also be used to make Web Servlets,
background TCP or UDP servers, or ordinary GUI-based desktop
applications. The latter are easiest to demonstrate, so we'll use
them for our example. Most of what we say here applies to the GUI
part of an Applet as well.</p><p>The simplest application is probably a window with a quit
button that exits when you run it. The simplest form of the program
is shown in <a href="2673l1.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
1.</b></span></a></p><p>In this listing, the class ButtonDemo1 is both the &ldquo;model&rdquo;
(data handling code) and the &ldquo;action listener&rdquo;, the code that
responds to user events such as pushed buttons. The class &ldquo;extends
JFrame&rdquo; so that it can be a top-level window. Also, it
&ldquo;implements ActionListener&rdquo; so that it can provide the
<span   class="bold"><b>actionPerformed</b></span> method called by
the button when it is pressed.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2673f3.large.jpg"><img src="2673f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Button
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2673f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Demo Button
</p></div></div><p>Having a GUI layout be its own action listener works
adequately for toy applications. The actionPerformed method has to
figure out somehow which button was pressed. It's not hard here,
but doesn't scale well: as the code gets larger and larger, it
becomes difficult to manage all the interactions among the GUI
components. Thus, it is preferable for each component to have its
own action listener. One way of doing this is to use Java's &ldquo;inner
classes&rdquo;: write one class inside another. The inner class is
syntactically analogous to nested procedures in languages like
Pascal. In Listing 2, I have simply added a second button and
recast the code so that each button has its own listener.</p><p><a href="2673l2.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing 2.
Demo Button with Inner Class
ActionListener</b></span></a></p><p>Now we can write a third version (not shown, but available in
the archive file on the FTP site) that uses CheckButtons instead of
JButtons. This version will not quit, but will change the GUI among
those listed.</p><p>The action listener for each button just calls the UIManager
class' <span   class="bold"><b>setLookAndFeel</b></span> method with
the correct full class name and a utility class'
<span   class="bold"><b>updateComponentTreeUI</b></span> passing in
the top-level window (the JFrame subclass). This changes all
components in the tree to display in the newly selected look and
feel. Since some components may need a different size, we again
call the JFrame <span   class="bold"><b>pack</b></span> routine,
which computes the sizes of all components and makes the main
window large enough to hold them all.</p><p>This, along with a working knowledge of the other &ldquo;action&rdquo;
components, is enough to begin writing portable Java-based GUI
applications. However, before we can approach large-scale
applications, we must consider the organization and partitioning of
the code, and the ideal way to handle this is with a paradigm known
as MVC, or Model-View-Controller.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f0580.0x28e2fe0"></a>MVC In Java</h2></div></div><p>Model-View-Controller provides a powerful model for
separating the functionality of a GUI-based application into three
constituent parts. Putting it simply, the model is the code that
keeps track of the data. The view is the code that displays the
model on screen. The controller is the code that responds to user
actions such as mouse clicks, button presses and the like. This
separation, first formalized in 1988 for use with Smalltalk-80, has
become the dominant model for object-oriented developers building
GUI-based applications. And with good reason: it partitions the
code into three (or more) reasonably small modules. It provides
maximum flexibility&mdash;there can be more than one view and more than
one controller. In a slide show program, for example, you might
have a Slide Show view and a Slide Sorter view. Either or both
would be visible, each in its own window. With MVC, a change to
either would immediately be reflected in all the views. So a
results-oriented way of looking at MVC is a way of making all the
views on your data be dynamically self-updating as the data
changes.</p><p>Let's take that slide show program as a simple example, which
I've called JabberPoint (no relation at all to PowerPoint). The
main program (see
<a href="2673l3.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
3</b></span></a>) simply creates the model, the view and the
controllers, then connects them together.</p><p>The data or model is maintained by a class called JPModel. It
is little more than an array of Strings, except that each line has
a Style associated with it. The model also has certain other data,
such as the current slide number. Plus, it has methods for updating
the data. This version of the program doesn't have any
slide-editing capabilities (I still use <span   class="emphasis"><em>vi</em></span> to
edit the show's text), but it does have methods&mdash;in the model&mdash;to
change the current slide number.</p><p>Note that this is not the full source code, but only the
fragments needed to show the MVC architecture. If you want the full
source code to compile or use, go to the course author's web site
(see sidebar) and follow the link to Free Software.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The model contains the data and functionality, and
can be displayed by many views. It commonly includes a main program
and may subclass java.util.Observable.</p></li><li><p>The view is the GUI or display of the model's data.
It commonly creates a frame, or is an applet, and adds listeners.
It may implement java.util.Observer.</p></li><li><p>The controller handles events for the model and the
view. It commonly implements listener interfaces and responds to
events by calling methods in the model.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f0580.0x28e3560"></a>The Model</h2></div></div><p>Part of the model, Model.java, is shown in
<a href="2673l4.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
4.</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f0580.0x28e3718"></a>The View</h2></div></div><p>The simplest view is a SlideShow view, which simply paints
the current page in large letters. This view is a Component that
can be embedded in a Frame or an Applet.</p><p>How does it know when its data has changed? Note the method
<span   class="bold"><b>update</b></span>. This is not the update
method of AWT, but is part of the Observable interface. This update
simply saves the data that was passed in as a Slide and calls AWT's
<span   class="bold"><b>repaint</b></span>, which will call the
<span   class="bold"><b>paint</b></span> method a few lines below it
in the listing.</p><p>There can be more than one view. A slide-show program usually
has three: the slide show (which we implement), the Outline and the
Sorter (which we do not yet provide). Each of these would be a
different view and would be registered as an Observer for the model
as above. You would switch between them with a CardLayout or some
kind of Tab Layout manager, or they could each be in a Frame. Since
they use Observable/Observer, when you update the data in one
window it would immediately be updated in all of them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f0580.0x28e39d8"></a>The Controllers</h2></div></div><p>The controllers are called when the user does something. The
KeyController.java is a simple controller that responds to PageUp
and PageDown (or Enter) and moves the current page up or down as
appropriate. It is &ldquo;connected&rdquo; with</p><pre     class="programlisting">
frame.addKeyListener(new KeyController(model));
</pre><p>A Controller does not have to be an explicit listener. We
might, for example, use a MenuBar as a listener and connect it with
the statement
<pre     class="programlisting">
frame.setMenuBar(new MenuController(view,model));
</pre>


after the instantiation of KeyController in our main program. It
then calls methods on the Model, such as
<span   class="bold"><b>nextPage</b></span>.
</p><p>We can add additional functionality such as
<span   class="bold"><b>loadFile</b></span>. When we get around to
writing the editing part of this program, we can add methods such
as <span   class="bold"><b>saveFile</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>newFile</b></span>, etc., to the model and
call them from here.</p><p>One complication is that the MenuController may need access
to the top-level frame (just for purposes of Dialog creation), but
the view is a component inside the frame, and we don't wish View to
know too much about its environment. One way around this is to pass
the frame into the MenuController's constructor; another is for the
view to have a <span   class="bold"><b>getFrame</b></span>
method.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f0580.0x28e3e50"></a>Where is Main?</h2></div></div><p>The model, view and controller are usually tied together with
a <span   class="bold"><b>main</b></span> program; the part of
JabberPoint.java that sets this up is shown in the method JPMain, a
&ldquo;Constructor&rdquo; in Listing 3.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f0580.0x28e3fb0"></a>Beyond the Basics</h2></div></div><p>MVC can be more complex than this, although we've covered the
basics here. For an extremely powerful (and wonderful) example, see
the JFC/Swing components JTable and TableDataModel. In fact, we'll
use these in our simple UNIX Administration Tool.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f0580.0x28e40b8"></a>Java for Linux Administration</h2></div></div><p>Here we present a simple example of a Linux/UNIX
administration tool, a program for viewing password and group file
information. It may seem strange to write system-specific
administration tools in a portable language&mdash;this tool will work on
most UNIX variants. And anyway, Java is a nice language to write
in, and the JFC GUI components bring the creation of powerful tools
to a wider audience. In particular, this tool will let us showcase
the JTable widget, which provides most of the screen functionality
of a spreadsheet, including dynamically-arrangeable columns and
other nice options.</p><p>Since Java is portable, it doesn't provide an API for reading
the system password file. We designed and wrote a class PW that has
the same public members as the C-language structure returned by the
system password resolvers. We also provide a &ldquo;PWReader&rdquo; class to
read them and provide a sample implementation that just reads from
a traditional format password file. This is not suitable for
production use on most systems, but serves as a simple
demonstration. Since these readers don't affect the GUI, we won't
discuss them in detail here, but the code for both is
on-line.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f0580.0x27f4b28"></a>Displaying and Searching the Password
Information</h2></div></div><p>Since we want this to be a &ldquo;good&rdquo; application and maybe the
basis for a general UNIX user database editor (read, write,
validate) later on, we'll design it according to the
model-view-controller paradigm from the start. I called this
program <span   class="bold"><b>Ued</b></span>, originally in tribute
to a much older program written at the University of Toronto around
1982 and maintained for a time by my colleague Geoffrey Collyer. My
program has no code in common with that older ued. The class
<span   class="bold"><b>UedModel</b></span> (see UedModel.java) is
the user data portion of the program.
<span   class="bold"><b>UedView</b></span> displays a list of users
or groups on the screen.
<span   class="bold"><b>UedControl</b></span> responds to user
requests to modify the data. The main thing to note is the
look-and-feel it presents (see Figure 5).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2673f5.large.jpg"><img src="2673f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Ued Screenshot
</p></div></div><p>Note that you can drag columns around. If we wanted the user
to be able to sort by user ID, for example, we'd have our sort
routine interrogate the &ldquo;table model&rdquo; to see the current column
order and use that for sorting. You can select a column by clicking
on its title. (This feature isn't used here, but would be in a
spreadsheet.) Or you can select all the fields in a row (one user)
by clicking anywhere. This would be used in a menu-based &ldquo;Delete&rdquo;
operator, for example.</p><p>How does the data get into the table? The nice thing about
JTable is that it specifies a helper class called a JTableModel,
which is the interface between your data model and the JTable. Once
we have a data model based on PW objects as described above, the
JTableModel need only obtain the individual fields for the table
and return them to the JTable upon request. See source file
UedTableModel.java, which is only about 40 lines long, most of it
is just a switch statement. Again, JFC's object model makes code
development easy.</p><p>Note also that the main program is in a tabbed layout. Group
and Properties tabs are also present and not yet implemented, but
they do show how easy it is to use the JTabLayout. We just
write:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
JTabbedPane mainPane = new JTabbedPane();
 add tabbed pane to Frame
cp.add(BorderLayout.CENTER, mainPane);
 add user view to tab
mainPane.addTab("Users", uv);
mainPane.addTab("Groups",
 new JLabel("Not Written Yet", JLabel.CENTER));
mainPane.addTab("Properties",
 new JLabel("Not Written Yet", JLabel.CENTER));
</pre><p>From then on, management of the tab view is automatic&mdash;when
the user clicks on a tab, its content is brought to the fore and
displayed.
</p><p>The neat thing about JTable/JTableModel is that you can
easily make any table editable just by following these three
steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Write a routine
<span   class="bold"><b>isEditable</b></span> that returns
<b  >true</b>.</p></li><li><p>Provide a
<span   class="bold"><b>CellEditor</b></span>, which can be a wrapper
on a <b  >TextField</b> (then you need only double-click
in a cell to start editing it).</p></li><li><p>Write a <span   class="bold"><b>setValueAt</b></span>
routine for the TableModel to call to set the values in your
program when the user changes them on-screen.</p></li></ol></div><p>That's all you need, although in a real application you would
also do some error checking and set a &ldquo;save needed&rdquo; flag. The
password editor in the Ued program does this. In effect, the JTable
widget gives you almost all of the user interface portion of a
spreadsheet, and it is just one of the many great widgets included
in the Swing Set of JFC. And that's just one piece of the new
functionality included in Java 1.2.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f0580.0x27f55d0"></a>Java in the Crystal Ball</h2></div></div><p>The near future for Java shows no letup in the rapid rate of
innovation. JFC has just been released, with the 1.2 version of
Java. Many promising technologies are just on the horizon,
including 3-D, JTAPI, Java Sound, Java Speech and many others.
Since there is far too much alphabet soup to remember, please check
out the JavaSoft API page at
http://java.sun.com/products/api-overview.html. The 3-D API tries
to provide a comprehensive imaging model for three-dimensional
graphics with some of the best features of PEX, GL and friends.
JTAPI lets Java programs control telephony equipment at all scales,
from a single voice-mail modem up to a large Private Branch
Exchange (PBX). Java Media Framework gives access to all kinds of
image, audio and video recording/playback, including Java Sound.
Java Sound will provide several sound formats from simply playing
sound files (available in 1.2), to recording, to full control over
synthesizers such as MIDI. Java Speech will include both speech
synthesis and speech recognition.</p><p>Many contact tracker systems are available from the simple
(my own freeware JabaDex) to the fancy ones limited to MS-Windows,
such as Symantec ACT. When Java Sound and JTAPI are released,
developers of contact tracker systems can write code to dial the
phone, answer it and incorporate voice mail, maybe even add
bidirectional FAX support. We will no longer have to write it once
for Linux, again for MS-Windows, again for Macintosh and again for
Solaris. We will be able, as JavaSoft's slogan promises, to &ldquo;write
once, run anywhere&rdquo;.</p><p><a href="2673s1.html" target="_self">Java Networking API</a></p><p><a href="2673s2.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
