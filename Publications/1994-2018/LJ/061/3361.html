the December 1998 issue was well-written and full of relevant
information. I am the IT Manager at a Novell/NT shop and have been
using Linux at home off and on over the past couple of years. I
still consider myself a novice user. A couple of weeks ago, I
secretly switched a few of my users from an NT/IIS server to a
Linux/Apache server running our Intranet. They noticed a definite
increase in performance, and I plan to eventually move everyone
over to the Linux server. However, on my end I was having problems
setting up X on the server and finally decided that the command
line would do. Then I read the article on X administration in
<i  >LJ</i>. Now X is up and running and configured to
my specifications. Thanks for the help.</p><p>&mdash;Barry Julien bjulien@wallacefunds.org</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1532580.0x162a298"></a>User Friendly</h2></div></div><p>Just wanted to let you know that I think adding the comic

poses to Microsoft. While there is some truth to this, I think what
everyone seems to be overlooking is the threat it poses to other
UNIX systems. I think this is clearly demonstrated by the fact that
Sun and SCO have started offering free licenses of Solaris 7 and
SCO 5.0.4 for educational and non-commercial use (users must pay a
fee of approximately $20 US for the media and shipping).
Admittedly, commercial users must still pay full price for a
license, but by making their systems available to home users,
hobbyists and students, they are acknowledging the threat Linux
poses to their systems. After all, the reason Linus started
developing Linux was to make it easier for him to learn UNIX. It
would seem that Sun and SCO have come to the realization that
anyone wanting to learn UNIX will <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be
learning their versions unless they make them affordable.</p><p>As a side note, I have already received and installed Solaris
7. While it is a good package, I found it a little disappointing.
Having used various Red Hat distributions, I found Solaris to be a
rather bare-bones system. I expect this will also be the case with
SCO 5.0.4 when I get a chance to experiment with it. Sun and SCO
should watch out&mdash;their efforts may be too little too late.</p><p>Keep up the great work with <i  >LJ</i>.</p><p>&mdash;Mark Mathews garcin@earthlink.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1532580.0x162a710"></a>VNC</h2></div></div><p>Thanks to Brian Harvey for his excellent article on VNC,
&ldquo;Virtual Network Computing&rdquo; in the February issue.</p><p>I have tried several commercial tools to allow me to maintain
an NT server from my desktop (the server rooms are
<span   class="emphasis"><em>cold</em></span>). At best, I have had mixed results,
often serious disappointment and consequences. I work in a
semi-homogeneous networking/computing environment, mostly Novell
and NT, with ERP/MRP management on OS/400, Win95/NT at the desktop,
and a smattering of other UNIX workstations (mostly Sun). Linux is
hiding all over the place on an increasing number of &ldquo;dedicated
service&rdquo; boxes. We don't talk about it too much, since our IS
upper management is still very skeptical.</p><p>Encouraged by Mr. Harvey's comments, I tried VNC the morning
I read his article. I am delighted at both the cleanness and the
benign operation on the several platforms of interest to me. It is
a great effort on a strong computing foundation with room to grow.
What more could anyone want?</p><p>Hats off to the good folks at Olivetti &amp; Oracle Labs for
such a fine addition to the rapidly expanding Open Source

consistently publishing a technical journal of high quality for a
diverse readership. It clearly merits being classified as a journal
even though it is not published under the auspices of some
professional society.</p><p>Moreover, and this bears upon the ideas of the first
paragraph, <i  >LJ</i> is to be thanked and applauded
for including articles and editorials dealing with the social
issues pertaining to open software. The February 1999 issue stands
out for both the guest editorial by Alessandro Rubini (citing prior
work by Russell Nelson, August 1998) and the article by Dr. Steve
Mann. A journal should take on such social responsibility.</p><p>The ubiquitous computer, as no other machine invention
before, has impinged upon the workings of society, for the most
part to its benefit. It is necessary for the commonweal that
computers be developed in the open, both to accelerate the benefits
they may provide and to prohibit their misuse and the stifling of
progress.</p><p>Societies make laws permitting the existence of corporations
and their exclusive exploitation of inventions and intellectual
property, not for the benefit of a clever elite, but for the common
good. Monopolistic practices may be tempered by restrictions when
they become antithetical to social welfare. The current state of
computer software suggests that such change is needed.</p><p>We, as citizens, can bring about necessary changes through
political action aided by open discourse and the publication of
ideas.</p><p>&mdash;David E. Baker debaker@pacbell.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1532580.0x162ad40"></a>Response to LTE in February</h2></div></div><p>I felt compelled to respond to a letter submitted by David
Briars to the <i  >Linux Journal</i> editor in the
February 1999 issue. I applaud David for being relatively informed
on the issues of security. Yet I am disappointed at the solution
that he devised. Of course, a properly configured Linux box is a
safe house in regards to people breaking in. I emphasize
<span   class="emphasis"><em>properly</em></span> because a default Red Hat 5.2 Linux
install is extremely insecure from some of the default services
running. I found out the hard way that somewhere between the
included POP2, POP3 and IMAP services and the way they are
configured, a significant security threat exists. I had a Linux
machine on the network, accessible by the Internet for web
services, and I noticed an IRC bot running illegally. All this from
the most secure operating system available, in my opinion.</p><p>I learned not to blame the operating system, but to go to the
source. Windows 9<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> is not insecure by default.
Faulty applications (earlier versions of Internet Explorer,
Netscape, etc.), malicious programming such as Back Orifice, or
perhaps enabling File and Print Sharing for a personal home network
but not removing the binding to the dial-up connection are examples
of how a good thing goes bad.</p><p>Don't be so quick to blame the OS; be informed and stay on
top of the game. As long as a human creates the code, a human can
break it.</p><p>&mdash;James W.

on-line. Could you please tell me the reasoning? I find it very
annoying because I do not always get a chance or even remember to
come look at the site when the next issue is available to see what
you have left out of the magazine. Some of these articles are
excellent and I don't see why they are not included in the
magazine.</p><p>It is especially annoying as I receive my copy of the
magazine about a month after it is available and so your site is
usually showing a couple of issues ahead of what I am reading.
Thanks.</p><p>&mdash;Sean Preston spreston@icon.co.za</p><p>We added this feature to our web site because we are very
fortunate in having an excess of articles for each issue. We think
they are excellent too and do not want them to go to waste because
a particular issue has no space for them. If we hold on to them too
long while waiting for space, they can become dated. All of these
articles are listed in the magazine's Contents, so there is no need
to look at the site to see &ldquo;what we left out&rdquo;. Also, since the
Contents is put on the web site about three weeks before the
magazine is shipped, these articles are available for your perusal
in advance. I hope you will come to see this as an asset rather
than an annoyance &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1532580.0x162b3c8"></a>Grace Hopper's Computer Bug</h2></div></div><p>The January issue's article on women in technology repeats a
persistent myth about Grace Hopper coining the term &ldquo;bug&rdquo;. Hopper
herself was not present when the moth was removed from Harvard
University's Mark II computer in 1947 and &ldquo;First actual case of
bug being found&rdquo; entered in the log book. The term was popularized
by Hopper's telling of the story, but was in use before then, as
Hopper herself noted, and as the log entry makes clear. It was used
as far back as the end of the last century, applied then to
electrical equipment.</p><p>&mdash;Niall Kennedy nkennedy@acm.org</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1532580.0x162b528"></a>Re: Red Hat Phenomenon</h2></div></div><p>In his letter in the March 1999 <i  >Linux Journal</i>, Reilly Burke states that Red Hat &ldquo;is
unconventional in layout, difficult to install, extremely difficult
to reconfigure and deficient in basic tools. The worst problem is
that Red Hat requires extensive editing of C source code and
rebuilding of the kernel.&rdquo;</p><p>I use Red Hat Linux every day at home and work and have
installed it on several machines, both Intel and Alpha-based. I
don't understand Mr. Burke's complaints. While I don't have much
experience with non-Red Hat flavors of Linux, I have installed and
used several other operating systems, and I find Red Hat Linux
easier to install than most. The base distribution contains almost
every tool I have ever needed and I've never had to do extensive
editing of C source. However, I have needed to recompile my kernel
a few times and have had a few configuration problems, mainly due
to lack of knowledge.</p><p>While Red Hat Linux does have a few warts, especially on my
Alpha system, I do not agree with Mr. Burke's objections. Thank
you.</p><p>&mdash;Richard Griswold richard@home.com</p></div></div>
