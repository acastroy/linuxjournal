    A look at the new Qt public license and the effects it may
    have on software development for KDE and GNOME.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d3580.0x1acb2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Troll Tech announced in November that its
upcoming Qt 2.0 Free Edition GUI toolkit will have a more open
license. Qt is best known in the Linux community as the GUI toolkit
used to develop KDE (K Desktop Environment), a UNIX desktop
environment. Qt Free Edition 1.X for UNIX is currently free for
non-commercial use&mdash;if you want to sell your software, you need to
purchase Qt Professional Edition, which starts at over $1000 for a
single-user license.
</p><p>The new licensing terms apply to the upcoming version 2.0 of
Qt, currently in beta release, and is considered &ldquo;open source&rdquo;.
Troll Tech has dubbed its new license the &ldquo;Q Public License&rdquo; or
&ldquo;QPL&rdquo;. How does this new license differ from the old one? The
license for Qt Free Edition 1.X does not allow developers to
redistribute modified versions of the Qt library. Some argue that
the Qt Free Edition 1.X license can delay projects that require
either fixes or enhancements to the Qt toolkit. By allowing
developers to distribute modified versions of Qt, the new license
overcomes this problem.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d3580.0x1acb450"></a>KDE</h2></div></div><p>The KDE project was started at the end of 1996. The
developers chose the Qt library over other toolkits such as Xforms
and Motif because of its documentation, its look and feel and
because they preferred using C++ (Qt) over C (Xforms and Motif).
The new QPL will have a positive effect on KDE development and will
most likely attract more developers to the project. When Qt 2.0
Free Edition is released, KDE will have the option of modifying Qt
for use with KDE and will thus be able to produce more frequent
releases.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d3580.0x1acb558"></a>Harmony</h2></div></div><p>The Harmony project was started to create an open source
replacement for Qt to be used with KDE, allowing KDE to become a
part of completely free operating systems. For example, according
to the &ldquo;Debian Free Software Guidelines&rdquo; (DFSG), Qt's existing
license prevents it from being included in Debian Linux. KDE meets
the DFSG requirements but requires Qt to run. Harmony's license
meets the DFSG restrictions allowing it (and KDE) to be included in
the Debian Linux distribution instead of Qt. The developers had
also planned on making Harmony an improvement over Qt by adding new
features such as multi-threading and themes which are included in
Qt 2.0. Although the new QPL is not as open as Harmony's GNU
Library General Public License (LGPL), it caused developers to lose
interest, and the Harmony Project was shut down in late
January.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d3580.0x1acb660"></a>GNOME</h2></div></div><p>The GNU Network Object Model Environment (GNOME) project was
announced in August 1997. GNOME is built with GTK+, a GUI toolkit
originally developed as part of the popular GIMP image tool. There
have been many heated debates over the licensing differences
between GNOME (GTK+) and KDE (Qt). GTK+ uses the LGPL license,
while Qt 1.X has a more restricted license. These issues were
behind the initiation of the GNOME project. Now that licensing for
KDE/Qt is becoming more open, GNOME's destiny as the desktop for
free operating systems might be a little less secure. KDE clearly
has a head start, having released KDE 1.1 in February while GNOME
1.0 was announced in March at the LinuxWorld Conference. GNOME,
unlike the Harmony project, does have corporate support. Red Hat's
Advanced Development Laboratories has a handful of people
developing GTK+ and GNOME and has been very committed to the GNOME
project.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d3580.0x1acb768"></a>Linux Distributions</h2></div></div><p>Caldera became an early adopter of KDE by including it in
OpenLinux 1.3 in September 1998, and plans to make it the default
desktop for OpenLinux 2.0. Red Hat intends to use GNOME 1.0 for its
default desktop and continues to use FVWM as its window manager in
the meantime. Red Hat has made KDE available from its &ldquo;Raw Hide&rdquo;
site which distributes developer releases, and will consider
putting KDE into its main distribution when Qt 2.0 Free Edition and
the corresponding version of KDE are available. Debian currently
distributes KDE and Qt on their &ldquo;non-free contrib&rdquo; CD, but not
the main distribution because it does not conform to the DFSG. It
appears that the new QPL license will allow Debian to include KDE
in their main distribution.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d3580.0x1acb870"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>The full effect of Troll Tech's new QPL will not be known for
quite some time. We'll need to wait for Troll Tech to release Qt
2.0 Free Edition and then for a new version of KDE based on Qt 2.0.
Clearly, it will be a positive change for KDE, allowing it to be
included in more Linux distributions. The effect on GNOME is less
clear, but the QPL announcement does not appear to have affected
GNOME development.</p><p><a href="3306s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
