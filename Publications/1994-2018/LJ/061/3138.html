    A description of POSIX thread basics for C programmers.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf40580.0x10382f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The purpose of this article is to provide
a good foundation of the basics of threaded programming using POSIX
threads and is not meant to be a complete source for thread
programming. It assumes the reader has a good strong foundation in
C programming.
</p><p>A thread is sometimes referred to as a lightweight process. A
thread will share all global variables and file descriptors of the
parent process which allows the programmer to separate multiple
tasks easily within a process. For example, you could write a
multi-threaded web server, and you could spawn a thread for each
incoming connection request. This would make the network code
inside the thread relatively simple. Using multiple threads will
also use fewer system resources compared to forking a child process
to handle the connection request. Another advantage of using
threads is that they will automatically take advantage of machines
with multiple processors.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, a thread shares most of its resources
with the parent process, so a thread will use fewer resources than
a process would. It shares everything, except each thread will have
its own program counter, stack and registers. Since each thread has
its own stack, local variables will not be shared between threads.
This is true because static variables are stored in the process'
heap. However, static variables inside the threads will be shared
between threads. Functions like
<span   class="bold"><b>strtok</b></span> will not work properly
inside threads without modification. They have re-entrant versions
available to use for threads which have the format
<span   class="emphasis"><em>oldfunction</em></span>_r. Thus, strtok's re-entrant
version would be <span   class="bold"><b>strtok_r</b></span>.</p><p>Since all threads of a process share the same global
variables, a problem arises with synchronization of access to
global variables. For example, let's assume you have a global
variable X and two threads A and B. Let's say threads A and B will
merely increment the value of X. When thread A begins execution, it
copies the value of X into the registers and increments it. Before
it gets a chance to write the value back to memory, this thread is
suspended. The next thread starts, reads the same value of X that
the first thread read, increments it and writes it back to memory.
Then, the first thread finishes execution and writes its value from
the register back to memory. After these two threads finish, the
value of X is incremented by 1 instead of 2 as you would
expect.</p><p>Errors like this will probably not occur all of the time and
so can be very hard to track down. This becomes even more of a
problem on a machine equipped with multiple processors, since
multiple threads can be running at the same time on different
processors, each of them modifying the same variables. The
workaround for this problem is to use a
<span   class="bold"><b>mutex</b></span> (mutual exclusion) to make
sure only one thread is accessing a particular section of your
code. When one thread <span   class="emphasis"><em>locks</em></span> the mutex, it has
exclusive access to that section of code until it
<span   class="emphasis"><em>unlocks</em></span> the mutex. If a second thread tries to
lock the mutex while another thread has it locked, the second
thread will <span   class="emphasis"><em>block</em></span> until the mutex is unlocked
and is once more available.</p><p>In the last example, you could lock a mutex before you
increment the variable X, then unlock X after you increment it. So
let's go back to that last example. Thread A will lock the mutex,
load the value of X into the registers, then increment it. Again,
before it gets a chance to write it back to memory, thread B gets
control of the CPU. It will try to lock the mutex, but thread A
already has control of it, so thread B will have to wait. Thread A
gets the CPU again and writes the value of X to memory from the
registers, then frees the mutex. The next time thread B runs and
tries to lock the mutex, it will be able to, since it is now free.
Thread B will increment X and write its value back to X from the
registers. Now, after both threads have completed, the value of X
is incremented by 2, as you would expect.</p><p>Now let's look at how to actually write threaded
applications. The first function you will need is
<span   class="bold"><b>pthread_create</b></span>. It has the
following prototype:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int pthread_create(pthread_t *tid,
   const pthread_attr_t *attr,
   void *(*func)(void *), void *arg)
</pre><p>The first argument is the variable where its thread ID will
be stored. Each thread will have its own unique thread ID. The
second argument contains attributes describing the thread. You can
usually just pass a NULL pointer. The third argument is a pointer
to the function you want to run as a thread. The final argument is
a pointer to data you want to pass to the function. If you want to
exit from a thread, you can use the
<span   class="bold"><b>pthread_exit</b></span> function. It has the
following syntax:
<pre     class="programlisting">
void pthread_exit(void *status)
</pre>


This will return a pointer that can be retrieved later (see below).
You cannot return a pointer local to that thread, since this data
will be destroyed when the thread exits.
</p><p>The thread function prototype shows that the thread function
returns a void * pointer. Your application can use the
<span   class="bold"><b>pthread_join</b></span> function to see the
value a thread returned. The pthread_join function has the
following syntax:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int pthread_join(pthread_t tid, void **status)
</pre><p>The first argument is the thread ID. The second argument is a
pointer to the data your thread function returned. The system keeps
track of return values from your threads until you retrieve them
using pthread_join. If you do not care about the return value, you
can call the <span   class="bold"><b>pthread_detach</b></span>
function with its thread ID as the only parameter to tell the
system to discard the return value. Your thread function can use
the <span   class="bold"><b>pthread_self</b></span> function to
return its thread ID. If you don't want the return value, you can
call <b  >pthread_detach(pthread_self())</b> inside your
thread function.
</p><p>Going back to mutexes, the following two functions are
available to us:
<span   class="bold"><b>pthread_mutex_lock</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>pthread_mutex_unlock</b></span>. They have
the following prototype:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int pthread_mutex_lock(pthread_mutex_t *mptr)
int pthread_mutex_unlock(pthread_mutex_t *mtr)
</pre><p>For statically allocated variables, you must first initialize
the mutex variable to the constant
<b  >PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER</b>. For dynamically
allocated variables, you can use the
<span   class="bold"><b>pthread_mutex_init</b></span> function to
initialize a mutex variable. It has the following prototype:
<pre     class="programlisting">
int pthread_mutex_init(pthread_mutex_t *mutex,
   const pthread_mutexattr_t *mutexattr)
</pre>


Now we can look at actual code as shown in Listing 1. I have
commented the code to help the reader follow what is being done. I
have also kept the program very basic. It does nothing truly
useful, but should help illustrate the idea of threads. All this
program does is initiate 10 threads, each of which increments X
until X reaches 4,000. You can remove the pthread_mutex_lock and
unlock calls to further illustrate the uses of mutexes.
</p><p><a href="3138l1.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing 1.
Example Program</b></span></a></p><p>A few more items need to be explained about this program. The
threads on your system <span   class="emphasis"><em>may</em></span> run in the order
they were created, and they <span   class="emphasis"><em>may</em></span> run to
completion before the next thread runs. There is no guarantee as to
what order the threads run, or that the threads will run to
completion uninterrupted. If you put &ldquo;real work&rdquo; inside the
thread function, you will see the scheduler swapping between
threads. You may also notice, if you take out the mutex lock and
unlock, that the value of X may be what was expected. It all
depends on when threads are suspended and resumed. A threaded
application may appear to run fine at first, but when it is run on
a machine with many other things running at the same time, the
program may crash. Finding these kinds of problems can be very
cumbersome to the application programmer; this is why the
programmer must make sure that shared variables are protected with
mutexes.</p><p>What about the value of the global variable
<span   class="emphasis"><em>errno</em></span>? Let's suppose we have two threads, A
and B. They are already running and are at different points inside
the thread. Thread A calls a function that will set the value of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>errno</em></span>. Then, inside thread B, it will wake up
and check the value of <span   class="emphasis"><em>errno</em></span>. This is not the
value it was expecting, as it just retrieved the value of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>errno</em></span> from thread A. To get around this, we
must define <b  >_REENTRANT</b>. This will change the
behavior of <span   class="emphasis"><em>errno</em></span> to have it point to a
per-thread <span   class="emphasis"><em>errno</em></span> location. This will be
transparent to the application programmer. The
<b  >_REENTRANT</b> macro will also change the behavior
of some of the standard C functions.</p><p>To obtain more information about threads, visit the
LinuxThreads home page at
http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/linuxthreads/. This page contains
links to many examples and tutorials. It also has a link where you
can download the thread libraries if you do not already have them.
Downloading is necessary only if you have a libc5-based machine; if
your distribution is glibc6-based, LinuxThreads should already be
installed on your computer. The source code for threaded
application that I wrote, gFTP, can be downloaded from my web site
at http://www.newwave.net/~masneyb/. This code makes use of all
concepts mentioned in this article.</p><p><a href="3138s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
