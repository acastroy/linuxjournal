    A real life experience in remote upgrading of a Linux PC
    across the Pacific Ocean.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdaf580.0xea78c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>As a business offering software
internationalization services, we operate a small office in western
Massachusetts as well as a small sister company in Taipei, Taiwan.
We also need to support a distributed software development
environment for engineers working remotely. While our bandwidth
demands are not great, we do need reliable e-mail, web, news and
FTP services. Primarily used to provide connectivity from the
inside office to the Internet, the connection has to be available
for external access from remote users on a 24 by 7 basis.
</p><p>The network consists of a variety of UNIX workstations and
PCs running Windows 95 and Windows NT, used for software
development and support as well as the usual office applications.
We use Linux running on Intel-based PCs as our network servers
because it provides one of the most cost-effective small business
network server solutions. The network uses a private class C
Internet address from the 192.168.*.* block, since it is not
directly connected to the Internet.</p><p>Our internal Linux server, with a Pentium 133MHz processor,
an Adaptec 2940 SCSI card, a bunch of SCSI drives and a 4mm DAT
tape drive, provides the backbone of our computing infrastructure.
As a mail hub, it provides POP3 and SMTP support for mail-client
applications running on the network. By running Samba, it acts a
network file server for Windows-based PCs. Finally, it provides
name resolution services using BIND.</p><p>The second Linux server in this &ldquo;dynamic duo&rdquo;, an old 486
PC with a 500MB hard disk and a monochrome monitor, is our external
gateway machine. It connects us to the Internet through a
persistent PPP connection with a static IP address over a 28.8K
dial-up phone line to a local Internet service provider. This
machine also acts as a dial-in server and as a firewall. It
provides an e-mail relay and spam filter to and from the internal
mail hub. HTTP, FTP and NNTP proxy services are also provided by
this machine to allow internal users access to these Internet
resources.</p><p>Both Linux machines were running Debian version 1.3. On an
Internet firewall machine, you want to have precise control over
what software is loaded on the machine. You want the minimum
necessary to do the job, no more. Since the machine was to be
remotely administered, it was even more important that it be easy
to upgrade individual packages as necessary without having to do
cold installs for new OS versions. Debian's
<span   class="bold"><b>dselect</b></span>/<span   class="bold"><b>dpkg</b></span>
system of handling software packages is ideal in this situation. We
could easily select the software required to run the system,
knowing that all prerequisite packages were included. Plus,
Debian's large collection of software packages included almost
everything we needed in its convenient dpkg format.</p><p>Debian Linux can be downloaded for free from
http://www.debian.org/ or a host of mirror sites. In our case, we
purchased a CD-ROM from Linux Software Labs, which also made it
easy to add a contribution to the Debian project, whose work we
greatly appreciate.</p><p>The Taipei office used a Linux gateway to connect to the
Internet, but the configuration was quite different. We were issued
a block of class C addresses from the Taiwanese ISP which
advertised a route to them. The gateway machine was running a
publicly accessible FTP server, HTTP server and mail hub, as well
as being the primary public name server for our domain in
Taiwan&mdash;all using a very old version of Caldera Linux.</p><p>When the operating systems on the server machines in the U.S.
office were upgraded to take advantage of the new features in Linux
2.0, it seemed an ideal time to upgrade the systems in Taiwan, as
well as reconfigure the network to more closely match the one in
the U.S. office.</p><p>While the project seemed straightforward enough, the problem
was that the work had to be done from ten thousand miles away
across the Pacific Ocean using the Internet.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdaf580.0xea7d40"></a>Planning</h2></div></div><p>Upgrading Linux boxes remotely, especially across the ocean,
requires some advance planning. Some of the issues we had to deal
with were:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Which Linux to use?</p></li><li><p>What were the security concerns?</p></li><li><p>Were we going to set up both a private and public
side network?</p></li></ul></div><p>Our choice for the first question was to stay with Debian
Linux version 1.3. It was the same version we were running in
Massachusetts, so we could essentially install a copy of what was
on the U.S. system, reconfigure it for the different names and
addresses in Taiwan, and be all set.
</p><p>Since the upgrade was to be done across the Internet,
security was a major concern. We needed a secure connection from
the U.S. to Taiwan so that logins and passwords would not be
revealed to Internet eavesdroppers and Ethernet sniffers; thus, we
chose the Secure Shell (SSH) package. Due to U.S. export
restrictions, we could not just upload the software from
Massachusetts, so we downloaded the source for the SSH package from
a Taiwanese FTP site to the Linux machine in the Taipei office. We
then compiled and installed it, so the install/upgrade could
proceed in a secure fashion.</p><p>While our U.S. setup is required to service only an internal
network, our Taiwanese operation decided they needed to set up an
area to allow public Web and FTP access. To do this without
compromising security for the internal network, things had to be
set up a bit differently.</p><p>Taiwan's block of Class C addresses, assigned by their ISP,
were used by both the internal machines and the firewall. We
designed a network setup including a publicly accessible network
created using these addresses for use by the public HTTP and FTP
servers. The rest of the machines were connected to a private
network, once again using addresses from the 192.168.*.* block as
in the U.S. office. The firewall machine was then configured with a
second Ethernet interface: one to connect the outside PPP
connection to the publicly available network and the other to
connect the private network. We then used the IP firewalling
capabilities of the Linux kernel to keep network traffic where it
belonged.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdaf580.0xea8210"></a>Hardware Preparation</h2></div></div><p>The Taiwan office already had an operational gateway PC named
&ldquo;dragon&rdquo;. Rather than upgrading it while using it to provide our
connection, a second machine, &ldquo;dolphin&rdquo; was identified as the new
gateway machine. This way, we could be sure the upgrade was
successful before putting it in place, and it gave us a fall-back
position in case it was not. Since the name and address of dragon
were in DNS maps outside of our control, and coordination with the
local ISP had proved inconvenient in the past, we had to swap the
identities of the machines before proceeding.</p><p>As the new dragon would be serving both public and private
networks, two network cards were installed. Simple jumper-capable
NE-2000 compatible cards were chosen so that their IRQs could be
easily configured. In order for our system administrator to log in
to dolphin through the Internet, a minimal Caldera Linux system was
installed on it. Finally, dolphin was connected to the local
network.</p><p>Since the new firewall machine was no longer going to act as
a mail hub for the network, an existing server running Linux,
&ldquo;elephant&rdquo;, was nominated. Sendmail and a POP3 server were
installed on elephant. Dragon was reconfigured to relay e-mail in
and out of the domain rather than acting as a hub. Elephant was
also configured to act as the DNS server for the internal network,
with dragon as a forwarder, since elephant would no longer be
directly connected to the Internet. In turn, dragon was configured
to continue acting as primary DNS server for the domain to the
outside world while using elephant as its resolver. This way, only
publically accessible machine names and addresses would be visible
from the Internet, while dragon would continue to be able to
resolve all internal addresses, both public and private.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdaf580.0xea83c8"></a>Coordination</h2></div></div><p>Two concerns arise when doing remote upgrades:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Disruption of Internet access must be avoided as
much as possible.</p></li><li><p>A human being must be present to act as a remote
pair of hands in the unlikely event that the new machine was hung
or rendered inaccessible or unbootable as the upgrade
proceeded.</p></li></ul></div><p>To avoid disruption, we decided that the upgrade should be
done during the weekend in Taiwan. Since a time zone difference of
exactly 12 hours exists between Massachusetts and Taipei, it was
agreed that the upgrade would start on Friday at 8 PM EST, or 8 AM
Saturday in Taiwan. A human would not have to be at the office in
Taiwan until 9 AM when the machine was ready to be rebooted.
</p><p>In advance of all this, gzipped tar files of the root, /usr
and /var file systems from the Massachusetts machine were
downloaded via FTP to the Taiwan office Friday night Taipei time.
The exercise of downloading, building and installing SSH was also
accomplished at this time.</p><p>Communication between the upgrader in the U.S. and the human
sentinel in Taiwan was necessary. To avoid making expensive
long-distance telephone calls (although we still ran up a $200+
telephone bill) unless it was necessary, we decided to use computer
communication whenever possible. Latency eliminated e-mail as a
possible choice. We chose to use talk when it worked and write
otherwise.</p><p>We started by adding partitions to the disk of the target
machine. Three new partitions were created with fdisk in order to
hold the new root, /usr and /var file systems. Next, a reboot was
needed in order to ensure the new label was in force so that new
file systems could be created and the tar files restored. We used
<span   class="bold"><b>rdev</b></span> to set the new root device in
the kernel so that it would be ready to boot the freshly installed
operating system. Then we needed to localize the machine, changing
the name and address of the machine to match the Taipei office
network.</p><p>Sometime in the middle of this work, it was noon in Taipei.
After sending a warning note to the upgrader in the U.S. that no
human would be there for an hour to restart the machine in case of
a foul up, the Taiwan staff headed off to lunch.</p><p>It took two more hours after the Taipei people came back from
lunch before things became almost ready. The DNS maps were copied
over from dragon so the machine would be ready to step right in as
primary name server for the domain.</p><p>At that point, dolphin was rebooted into the newly installed
system for the first time&mdash;all seemed well. It was also almost 3 AM
the next morning in Massachusetts. We were now ready to hook up the
new dragon to the Internet.</p><p>The first order of business was to switch the names and IP
addresses of old and new dragon before performing the physical
switchover. The files /etc/hosts, /etc/hostname and
/etc/init.d/network all contain references to the hostname and IP
addresses that needed to be changed. Once done, the modem was
unplugged from old dragon and plugged into new dragon and it was
time to go for the gold.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdaf580.0xea89a0"></a>Problems</h2></div></div><p>Dragon is connected to the ISP via a dedicated leased line.
Its modem is designed for use on a 2/4-wire leased line circuit and
is of the type that automatically connects to the ISP whenever the
phone line is plugged in.</p><p>With bated breath, we waited for the new dragon to connect
up. What we got instead were several screens of error messages.
Dragon's modem has a large LCD display indicating that the modem
was on-line, so the problem had to be in the configuration. It was
4 AM in Massachusetts.</p><p>We switched everything back to the way it was, so our
upgrader could log in and find the problem. But we now realized
that we must send our upgrader off to bed, as he was dozing off
while typing. We decided to continue the upgrade the next morning,
Taipei time.</p><p>Fortunately, it turned out that the problem was quite simple:
we had not configured the routing table correctly. After fixing
this, the new dragon was able to come up without a hitch and we
were able to dispatch our upgrader to bed early that night.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdaf580.0xea8bb0"></a>Final Check</h2></div></div><p>After our upgrader had gone to bed and we had the system up
and running, it was time to make sure everyone's web browser and
e-mail continued to work. Because the internal network is now on
the private IP, the IP addresses of all internal UNIX and Windows
computers had to be changed to 192.168.*.*. The web browsers also
had to be reconfigured to look for the web proxy server on dragon's
new private IP address. Finally, e-mail clients had to be
reconfigured to look for the POP3 server from elephant, the new
mail server.</p><p>As access to the internal network from the Internet is
through the use of a one-time password, this particular system had
to be checked. Finally, we also wanted to serve web pages from the
public side of the network, so a plug was put into the firewall
toolkit configuration to the Windows NT machine running IIS
(Internet Information Server). For a while, the plug was not
working reliably&mdash;that is, until we found out we had accidentally
messed up the name table. With that fixed, we had all the pieces
the Taipei office needed in working order.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdaf580.0xe9f5a0"></a>Still in Progress</h2></div></div><p>We eventually want to replace
<span   class="bold"><b>fwtk</b></span> with IP masquerading. This
makes the network more convenient to access from the inside
network. We do have a test network that has it all working, so we
will be deploying it shortly in the Massachusetts office. We want
to be able to make public multiple web servers for corporate,
testing and internal uses. These can be UNIX or Windows NT
machines. The IP forwarding facility of the Linux kernel should
make this fairly painless.</p><p><a href="3209s1.html" target="_self">Acknowledgements</a></p></div></div>
