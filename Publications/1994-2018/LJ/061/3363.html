specific machine (i.e., server)? And is it possible to allow some
users to TELNET to a specific machine and some not? &mdash;Ethan Bambock,
ebambock@hotmail.com</p><p>You can disable TELNET in the /etc/inetd.conf file. Look at
the /etc/security/access.conf file to allow access on a per-user
basis. &mdash;Marc Merlin, marc@merlins.org</p><p>[See also man pages for hosts_access(5) and hosts_options(5).

attempt to use <span   class="bold"><b>ftp</b></span> to access the
Red Hat machine from another computer, I get the message
&ldquo;connection is closed by the remote host&rdquo;. It won't even give me
the opportunity to type in a name or anything. I have not had this
problem with previous Linux versions. I am on a Gateway Pentium 133
on a 16MB token-ring network. Incidentally, using TELNET works
fine. &mdash;Steve Mitchell, mitchells@co.monterey.ca.us</p><p>There are two possible answers to this problem, depending on
the FTP client you are using.</p><p>If you are using NcFTP, and you are not forcing it to ask you
for a user name and password with <b  >-u</b>, it will
automatically try to log in as root, if you are logged in as root
locally. Most distributions of Linux prevent root logins via FTP
for security. You can change this by editing /etc/ftpusers, which
is a list of users who may not log in via FTP.</p><p>If you are not using NcFTP, the service is either not
installed or not correctly configured on the remote server. This is
less likely to be the problem, and you can test it by trying to
connect from another machine on the local network, as opposed to
your home system. In this case,
<span   class="bold"><b>inetd</b></span> (the service that handles
incoming connections and spawns the handler daemons) is either not
finding <span   class="bold"><b>ftpd</b></span> where it has been
told to look or is not able to start the process for some reason.
<span   class="bold"><b>inetd</b></span> is configured via
/etc/inetd.conf, and you may want to look at that file to see if
the FTP service is commented out. &mdash;Chad Robinson,
chadr@brt.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d1e580.0x1e16660"></a>Sluggish Server?</h2></div></div><p>For a long time I had no problems with my Linux distribution,
but then I switched over to a new system, which had a K6 266MHz and
64MB of SDRAM. For the most part I have no problems, but when
running certain applications, namely Emacs, NcFTP and Netscape (I
am using Communicator 4.04), I find they load up too slowly and
Netscape runs too slowly to use. I've heard this may be because of
slow FPU speeds on the AMD but either way I want to know if there
is a way to avoid this problem. I would use Lynx for web browsing
except that it doesn't support a proxy connection. (My Internet
access is through a proxy server.)--Derek Wollenstein,
fortmax@geocities.com
</p><p>It sounds to me as if Linux is not seeing all of your memory.
You should verify that it is all there with the command
<span   class="bold"><b>free</b></span>. The total column will
indicate how much is recognized. If it does not show (in kilobytes)
close to 64MB, you must specifically tell Linux there are 64MB.
This is done at boot time, so you must edit /etc/lilo.conf and add
the line <b  >append = "mem=64M"</b> to the options. Then
run <span   class="bold"><b>lilo</b></span> from the command prompt
and reboot.</p><p>One other thing could cause problems. Some BIOS revisions
come with an option for &ldquo;Memory Hole at 15M&rdquo;, which you should
disable. This option is for OS/2, so unless you are running OS/2
you do not need it. &mdash;Andy Bradford, andyb@calderasystems.com</p><p>I don't know about the slowdown, but Lynx does support
proxies! Look for the file lynx.cfg; it has examples of how to set
up a proxy right in the comments. &mdash;David M. Brown,

saying the package is already installed and cannot install;
however, when I run the <b  >rpm -q</b> to query the
package, it says it is not installed. I need certain packages such
as Perl that I cannot get installed and do not work. Please help!
The frustration is setting in. &mdash;Carlo Wise,
141618@bellsouth.net</p><p>Try using <b  >rpm -qa | grep perl</b> to list all
the packages that might be installed with the name of
<span   class="bold"><b>perl</b></span>. You can obviously change
&ldquo;perl&rdquo; to whatever package name you are looking for. &mdash;Andy
Bradford, andyb@calderasystems.com</p><p>There is some confusion at times as to the distinction
between a package name and an RPM file name. There is a difference!
When you wish to install an RPM, you use the RPM file name,
e.g.:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -ivh
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>where
<b><i><tt>filename</tt></i>-2.0-1.i386.rpm</b>
is the actual RPM file name. When you wish to reference an
installed RPM, you must use the package name (with or without the
version information), e.g.:</em></span>
<pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -q filename
</pre>


<span   class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span>
<pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -q filename-2.0-1
</pre>


<span   class="emphasis"><em>In this case, <b>rpm -q
filename-2.0-1.i386.rpm</b> will not work, as that is not the
package name. &mdash;David M. Brown, david@calderasystems.com</em></span>

it. How do I get my printer, a &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; HP, to work? I downloaded
the Ghostscript file to usrs, so what now? How do I get it to open,
and in the right place? Is there a manual that is for truly dumb
dummies? I have the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux For Dummies</em></span> book,
but it skips a lot. I do not know how to get into the cc disks
except to install. I have been using computers for 10 years,
self-taught with books, but these books are short on
HOWTOs. &mdash;Haroldel, haroldel@ix.netcom.com
</p><p>In your installation CD is a User's Guide rpm which addresses
a lot of questions, especially for beginners. For your printer

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d1e580.0x1e179f8"></a>Cross-Platform E-mail</h2></div></div><p>I have a requirement to dual-boot my PC (Linux/WinDoze). I
would like to be able to share an e-mail mail box between the two
operating systems. Other than Netscape Mail and Pine, is there an
e-mail client that runs natively on both platforms and has the
ability to share a common mail box? Netscape is good, but the mail
filtering rules are limiting. It also handles the summary files
differently between Linux and Windows. This results in the Windows
summary files being seen as mail boxes in Linux. It is quite
frustrating working on one platform only to realize the e-mail you
need to read was retreived from the server on the other
platform. &mdash;Larry Johnson, larryj@cyberramp.net
</p><p>Rather then answer your questions directly, I propose an
entirely different solution. When checking your e-mail, just make
sure you &ldquo;leave mail on server&rdquo;. Most clients support this. I
have set up many a corporate employee who wanted to synchronize
their e-mail on a laptop with their e-mail on a desktop
computer. &mdash;Mark Bishop, mark@bish.net</p><p>I recommend using an IMAP-compatible client to retrieve your
e-mail. Pine, Netscape, Outlook Express and many other mail clients
support the IMAP protocol. The benefit of using IMAP is that your
folders are kept on the server, so your client does not need to
store this information locally and attempt to share it with other
clients. I do this with Pine under Linux and Outlook Express in
Windows and have been quite happy with the results. Just be sure
you refresh your folder lists frequently, as most clients will not
do this automatically and will miss updates made in other
clients. &mdash;Chad Robinson, chadr@brt.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d1e580.0x1e17bb0"></a>Problem with Boot Disks</h2></div></div><p>I'm a beginner. After creating the boot disk using

configuration doesn't help. A fragment of LILO somehow remains and
tries to boot a nonexistent LINUX system, denying me access to

from my MBR? &mdash;Robert Morgan, rcm612@prodigy.net</p><p>There are ways of restoring your original MBR, but since the
drive has been formatted, that is not an option. Another method is
to first boot from a DOS boot floppy or Win95 rescue diskette. Then
run <b  >fdisk /mbr</b> which will write a new
MBR. &mdash;David M. Brown, david@calderasystems.com</p></div></div>
