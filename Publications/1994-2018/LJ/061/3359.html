    How to write your own program to read and send mail to any
    server on the Internet.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe5f580.0xf57450"></a></h2></div></div><p>E-mail is one of the unsung heroes of the
Internet. The Web makes the Internet fun and interesting and allows
me to keep up with most newspapers and magazines from the comfort
of my Haifa apartment. E-mail allows me to keep in touch with
friends, family and clients, as well as receive electronic
newsletters in a convenient format.
</p><p>I usually travel with my trusty Linux laptop, which means
that with the help of a telephone line, I can dial in to my
Internet provider and download the latest mail. However, on some
occasions I cannot dial in to check my mail, even though I have
full Internet access and a web browser. I could get an account at
Hotmail, but Hotmail allows you to read mail sent to its server
only, not to any mail server on the Internet.</p><p>This month, I will show you how to develop a set of CGI
programs to read e-mail from any POP server. These programs do not
provide a full-fledged e-mail client, but they do fill a niche and
are useful in certain circumstances. The software described this
month should demonstrate how relatively simple it is to create such
applications and will have the added bonus of providing basic
functionality for the times when you are away from the
office.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe5f580.0xf57608"></a>What is POP?</h2></div></div><p>Traditionally, e-mail on UNIX systems is stored on the user's
computer. If you have an account on a UNIX system, e-mail sent to
you is placed in a file on your computer. I receive mail on my
Linux system in the file /var/spool/mail/reuven.</p><p>However, this system became inadequate over time for a
variety of reasons. As users began to have their own full-fledged
UNIX workstations rather than terminals connected to a central
computer, system administrators wanted to centralize incoming mail
on a single server.</p><p>The answer was POP, &ldquo;post office protocol&rdquo;. Rather than
retrieving mail from a file on their own system, users would
download it from the POP server, with a single POP server per work
group cluster. A POP server typically stores incoming mail in a
traditional UNIX-style file, but allows retrieval and deletion of
individual messages via the network. Just as some cities and towns
require their residents go to a central post office in order to
retrieve letters and packages, POP requires users to retrieve their
mail from a central server.</p><p>POP has gone through a number of updates over the years, with
the most recent update named POP3. Over time, additional
functionality has been added, but the basic commands have remained
the same. POP allows users to check if they have mail, retrieve one
or more messages and delete one or more messages.</p><p>Users are generally shielded from the underlying mechanics of
POP3. Most modern e-mail programs support POP3. Indeed, e-mail
programs on non-UNIX systems depend on the existence of POP3
servers, since they are rarely able to run mail servers known as
&ldquo;mail transport agents&rdquo; or &ldquo;MTAs&rdquo;. Sendmail and qmail are two
examples of MTAs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe5f580.0xf57870"></a>Net::POP3</h2></div></div><p>Before writing a CGI program to read our mail, we must
understand how the program can accomplish this feat. We could write
our own software to talk to a POP3 server, but as is often the case
with Perl, a module already exists to handle this for us. In this
particular case, the module is
<span   class="bold"><b>Net::POP3</b></span>, part of the &ldquo;libnet&rdquo;
package of network modules available on CPAN. (For more information
on CPAN and its mirrors, go to http://www.cpan.org/.)</p><p>Net::POP3 provides an object-oriented interface to POP,
making it possible to connect to a POP server with only a basic
understanding of how the protocol works. Import the module
with</p><pre     class="programlisting">
use Net::POP3;
</pre><p>then create a new object with
<pre     class="programlisting">
my $pop = new Net::POP3($mailserver);
</pre>


where <b  >$mailserver</b> is a scalar containing the
name of our POP3 server. If the connection is successful,
<b  >$pop</b> will be an object with methods allowing us
to read and delete messages on the mail server. If the connection
is unsuccessful, <b  >$pop</b> will be undefined. Now all
methods in Net::POP3 work this way, returning
<b  >undef</b> if the call was unsuccessful. The
following code checks for this condition:
<pre     class="programlisting">
die "Error connecting to $mailserver."
   unless (defined $pop);
</pre>


In order to ensure e-mail remains private, POP3 servers require
users to log in with a user name and password. The
<span   class="bold"><b>login</b></span> method accomplishes that,
returning the number of messages waiting for the user:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my $num_messages = $pop-&gt;login($username,
   $password);
die "Error logging in." unless (defined
   $num_messages);
</pre>


Again, notice the test to see whether
<b  >$num_messages</b> is defined. If it is undefined,
then a mistake probably occurred in either the user name or
password.
</p><p>Each message on the POP server is identified with an index
number, ranging from 1 to <b  >$num_messages</b>. The
index number should stay constant during a single POP session, but
will change during future sessions. You can use the index number to
read or delete a message:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $message_ref = $pop-&gt;read($index);
</pre><p>If message number <b  >$index</b> exists, the
message headers and body are put into an array reference. Thus, if
<b  >$index</b> points to a message on our POP server,
<b  >$message_ref</b> is an array reference. Each element
of the array contains a single line of text from the message. We
can print the contents of the message by dereferencing
<b  >$message_ref</b>:
<pre     class="programlisting">
print @$message_ref, "\n";
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe5f580.0xf58108"></a>print-mail.pl</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have seen how Net::POP3 allows us to retrieve and
read mail from a POP server, let's look at how we can integrate it
into a CGI program. First, an HTML form is needed as a way to enter
a user name and password. Here is a simple one:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;Head&gt;
&lt;Title&gt;Read your mail!&lt;/Title&gt;
&lt;/Head&gt;
&lt;Body&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Read your mail!&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Enter your user name, password, and POP server.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;Form method="POST"
action="/cgi-bin/print-mail.pl"&gt;
&lt;P&gt;POP server: &lt;input type="text" name="mailserver"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Username: &lt;input type="text" name="username"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Password: &lt;input type="password" name="password"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="Show me my mail!"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/Form&gt;
&lt;/Body&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p>The above form sends three parameters to our CGI program&mdash;the
name of the POP server from which to download the mail, the user
name and the password. If you are concerned about the password
being sent in the clear, you might want to put the form and CGI
program behind a server running SSL, the secure sockets layer. You
might also want to investigate POP3's
<span   class="bold"><b>APOP</b></span> login method, which hides the
password somewhat.
</p><p>The program for reading mail is fairly simple; see Listing 1
in the archive file,
ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue61/3359.tgz. The code starts
by creating an instance of CGI, providing an object-oriented
interface to the CGI protocol. Then an appropriate MIME header is
sent to the user's browser, indicating the response will be in
HTML-formatted text. Next, the three pieces of information
necessary for retrieving the user's mail are grabbed: the name of
the POP server, the user name and the password.</p><p>Once that information is retrieved, we try to connect to the
POP server and log in. Normally, invoking
<span   class="bold"><b>die</b></span> is a bad idea in a CGI
program, since it results in a difficult-to-understand message
appearing on the user's screen. However, since we ported
<span   class="bold"><b>CGI::Carp</b></span> and specified
<b  >fatalsToBrowser</b>, any invocations of die will
send a description of the error message to the browser as well as
to the web server's error log. This can be an invaluable tool when
debugging, even if your final production code requires you to hide
potential error messages.</p><p>Once the number of messages waiting on the POP server is
known, we can retrieve them with a simple loop:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
foreach my $index (1 .. $num_messages)
{
   print "&lt;H2&gt;Message $index&lt;/H2&gt;\n";
   my $message_ref = $pop-&gt;get($index);
   print "&lt;pre&gt;\n", @$message_ref, "&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;HR&gt;\n";
}
</pre><p>We enclose the mail within &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;/pre&gt; tags,
since most e-mail depends on fixed-width fonts and formatting.
</p><p>You may be surprised such a simple program can be used to
read your mail, but it does and should work on any system with any
web browser. It can be used to quickly check if any new mail has
arrived, without affecting your ability to download and read
messages with your usual e-mail program.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe5f580.0xf58630"></a>Ignoring Uninteresting Headers</h2></div></div><p>As is often the case with new programs, our first stab was
functional but is missing some useful features. For instance, most
users do not need to see all of the headers that come with a
message. Typically, they want to see only the &ldquo;From&rdquo;, &ldquo;To&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Subject&rdquo;, &ldquo;Cc&rdquo; and &ldquo;Date&rdquo; headers.</p><p>Perl makes it a snap to remove unwanted headers by using
regular expressions. Headers can be thought of as a name, value
pair separated by a colon. On the left side of the colon is the
header name, which can consist of any alphanumeric character or a
hyphen. On the right side of the colon is the header's value, which
can consist of almost any character.</p><p>One consideration is the possibility that a header will be
spread across multiple lines. That is, the two lines</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Subject: This is a subject header
   that continues onto a second line
</pre><p>should all be considered part of the &ldquo;Subject&rdquo; header,
since the second line begins with one or more white-space
characters.
</p><p>This problem is solved by creating a hash,
<b  >%KEEP</b>, in which the keys name the headers to
keep. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my %KEEP = ("To" =&gt; 1,
   "From" =&gt; 1,
   "Subject" =&gt; 1,
   "Date" =&gt; 1);
</pre><p>The code then checks if a header is to be kept by checking
the value of <b  >$KEEP{$header_name}</b>, where
<b  >$header_name</b> contains the value of the header to
check.
</p><p>Before anything can be done to the headers, they must be put
into a scalar separate from the message body. Do that with
<span   class="bold"><b>split</b></span>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my ($headers, $body) = split "\n \n", $contents, 2;
</pre><p>Notice split has three arguments, telling Perl to split
<b  >$contents</b> into a maximum of two elements. If the
2 were omitted, <b  >$body</b> would contain only the
first paragraph of the message, rather than the entire text.
</p><p>Once the message headers are stored in
<b  >$headers</b>, it can be split back into an array,
and the code can then iterate through the array elements. Each
element of <b  >@headers</b> is a single header line,
which might mark the beginning of a new header or the continuation
of an existing one. If this is a new header and its name is in
<b  >%KEEP</b>, the header is written to the user's
browser. If the header's name is not in <b  >%KEEP</b>,
it is ignored and the program goes on to the next line.</p><p>This does not solve the issue of multi-line headers. This is
handled by assuming that every line in <b  >@headers</b>
will begin with either a header (e.g., <b  >Received:</b>
or <b  >X-Mailer:</b>) or with white space. If the
pattern at the beginning of the line matches a header value, the
program checks <b  >%KEEP</b> and if found, prints the
line. If the pattern fails to match a header value, it is assumed
to be white space, and the line is printed only if the previous
line was printed.</p><p>Here is some basic code to print the headers:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my @headers = split "\n", $headers;
my $previous = "";
foreach my $line (@headers)
{
   if ($line =~ m/^([\w-]+):/i)
   {
      $previous = $1;
   }
   print $line, "\n" if $KEEP{$previous};
}
</pre><p>This code is contained in Listing 2, better-print-mail.pl, in
the archive file. This is an improved version of our original
bare-bones program, incorporating this and other changes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe5f580.0xf4f9c0"></a>Handling HTML</h2></div></div><p>Displaying e-mail messages in a web browser has advantages
and disadvantages. On the one hand, we must be careful to turn
special characters, such as &lt; and &gt;, into their literal
equivalents. At the same time, we can take advantage of the web
browser to make e-mail addresses and URLs clickable.</p><p>Since we want to ensure that characters appear in the headers
as well as in the message body, we modify
<b  >$contents</b>, the variable that contains the entire
message contents, before separating the header and body. We turn
&lt; and &gt; into &lt; and &gt;, respectively, ensuring that
literal text will not be interpreted as if enclosed in HTML
tags:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$contents =~ s/&lt;/&lt;/g;
$contents =~ s/&gt;/&gt;/g;
</pre><p>Making e-mail addresses clickable requires the use of a
regular expression to match e-mail addresses. I decided to use the
following code:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$contents =~
   s|([\w-.]+@[\w-.]+\.[a-z]{2,3})|
   &lt;a href="mailto:$1"&gt;$1&lt;/a&gt;|gi;
</pre>


which looks for any combination of alphanumeric characters, hyphens
and periods, followed by an @, followed by the same combination of
characters, followed by a two- or three-letter top-level domain.
This ensures we will not accidentally turn something like
<pre     class="programlisting">
three pickles @ 20 cents/pickle
</pre>


into an e-mail address. By turning an actual e-mail address into a
&ldquo;mailto&rdquo; link, users can click on the link in order to send mail
to that address.
</p><p>Making URLs clickable is somewhat more difficult, since we
have to handle more combinations. The code below appears to match a
large number of URLs:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   s|(\w+tps?://[^\s&amp;\"\']+[\w/])|
   &lt;a href="$1"&gt;$1&lt;/a&gt;|gi;
</pre><p>Here, we look for any letters ending with &ldquo;tp&rdquo;, with an
optional &ldquo;s&rdquo; on the end. This allows us to match &ldquo;ftp&rdquo;,
&ldquo;http&rdquo; and &ldquo;https&rdquo;, all of which are valid protocols. We then
allow any combination of characters following the two slashes,
excluding white space and several characters which cannot be
transmitted in a URL.
</p><p>Quotation marks and white space can be sent if they are
URL-encoded first. Characters are URL-encoded when the hexadecimal
value of their ASCII code is preceded by a percent sign. For
instance, the space character is ASCII 32 or 0x20; thus, it can be
sent in a URL as %20. CGI.pm automatically decodes such characters,
so you need not worry about it in most cases.</p><p>The final part of our regular expression stipulates that the
final character of a URL must be alphanumeric or a slash. This
ensures that odd trailing characters, such as periods and commas,
will not be accidentally dragged into the URL and
highlighted.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe5f580.0xf4fe90"></a>Viewing Selected Messages</h2></div></div><p>The above program works just fine, if you want to view all
the messages in your mailbox. If you receive many e-mail messages,
viewing all of them in a single long web document can get
frustrating.</p><p>The program better-print-mail.pl takes into account the fact
that we might want to view only a selected list of messages. For
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if ($query-&gt;param("to_view"))
{
   @message_indices = $query-&gt;param("to_view");
}
else
{
   @message_indices = (1 .. $num_messages);
}
</pre><p>An HTML form element can be set multiple times, meaning that
the element <b  >"to_view"</b> might contain zero, one or
more elements. All of those are put inside of
<b  >@message_indices</b> unless
<b  >to_view</b> was not set, in which case all messages
are displayed by default.
</p><p>How can we get a list of current messages? A program called
mail-index.pl (see Listing 3 in the archive file) should do the
trick. This program can be invoked from the same sort of form we
have seen already; simply modify the &ldquo;action&rdquo; to point to
mail-index.pl, rather than better-print-mail.pl. As with
print-mail.pl and better-print-mail.pl, mail-index.pl must receive
the user name, password and name of the mail server in order to
function. With that information in hand, it logs into the POP
server and displays the message headers for mail waiting to be
read.</p><p>Each message is presented with a check box. By checking the
box next to a message, the user indicates he would like to read
that particular message. When the user clicks on the &ldquo;submit&rdquo;
button, better-print-mail.pl is sent not only the user name,
password and mail server, but also the list of checked messages. As
we have seen, better-print-mail.pl already knows how to handle this
list and prints only requested mail messages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe5f580.0xf50258"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Setting up a web-based mail system is not all that difficult.
I would hesitate before adding a
<span   class="bold"><b>delete</b></span> function, since I would
worry about deleting my only copy of a message. (My e-mail program
makes automatic backups, so I never have to worry about that on my
own computer.) However, adding such functionality would be quite
easy, technically speaking.</p><p>Next month, I will show you how to build a system that allows
you to send mail as well as read it. We will build on the software
we examined this month, adding some functionality to it and tying
it into our own mail-sending CGI programs. With a bit of software,
you too can begin to compete with Hotmail!</p></div></div>
