always enough to take care of site security. Sometimes a nice
program such as <span   class="bold"><b>mount</b></span> can be
exploited by a user to gain a higher system permission or remote
access to an unauthorized location on the World Wide Web.
</p><p>This article explains the logic behind a popular hack to
exploit a program's code so it executes different code then was
intended. This hack is known as the buffer-overflow hack and can be
used to exploit a program with <b  >suid</b> set to gain
better permissions on a Linux machine&mdash;sometimes even root or
remote access. (The examples are taken from &ldquo;aleph-one&rdquo; with his
permission and have been somewhat modified by me.)</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2902f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Virtual Memory Layout
</p></div></div><p>First, let's have a look at Figure 1 and see how a process
organizes its virtual memory. The TEXT area is where the actual
code of the program resides. The DATA area is where the initialized
and uninitialized data of the program resides.</p><p>The STACK area is a dynamic area which becomes bigger as data
is pushed into it and smaller as data is popped from it. It is
called a stack because it works in the LIFO way (last in, first
out). The stack is used to hold temporary data for the process and
helps the processor in its implementation of high-level functional
programming. To understand exactly how the processor makes use of
the stack, look at the following example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
void func(int a, int b)
{
  /* This function does nothing */
}
main()
{
 int num1;
 int num2;
 func(num1,num2);
 printf("This is the next instruction after " .
   "the function ...");
}
</pre><p>The instructions of the <span   class="bold"><b>main</b></span>
function are executed until the processor needs to &ldquo;break&rdquo; the
normal flow of the program and go to the
<span   class="bold"><b>func</b></span> instructions. When this step
of &ldquo;jumping&rdquo; to func is executed, the parameters to func,
<b  >num1</b> and <b  >num2</b> are transferred
with the help of the stack. That is, they are pushed to the stack,
and func can pop them from the stack and use them. Immediately
after pushing these values on the stack, main should push the
address to which func will return on completion. (In our example,
this is the address of the <span   class="bold"><b>printf</b></span>
instruction.) When func is finished, it knows to read this return
address from the stack and go back to the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; flow of the
program.
</p><p>One other value on the stack is called a frame-pointer, since
the processor refers to values on the stack by their offset from
the stack pointer (SP). Whenever the SP value changes, the
processor saves the current value on the stack. (The Intel does not
have a dedicated frame pointer (FP), so it does it with the help of
the <b  >ebp</b> register.) The frame pointer is pushed
to the stack following the return address.</p><p>To clarify this, let's look at another example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
void func(int a, int b)
{
 int *p;
}
main()
{
 int num;
 num = 0;
 func(num);
 num = 1;
 printf("num is now %d \n",num);
}
</pre><p>Let's compile it with the <b  >-S</b> option to get
assembly output using this <span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span>
command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -S -o ex2.S ex2.c
</pre>


We see that main's code is actually:
<pre     class="programlisting">
main:
pushl %ebp
movl %esp,%ebp    /* Save the SP before changing
                   * its value */
subl $4,%esp      /* SP should subtract 4 so it
                   * points to num on the stack */
movl $0,-4(%ebp)  /* Push num on the stack with
                   * value 0*/
pushl $2          /* Push 2 on the stack*/
pushl $1          /* Push 1 on the stack*/
call func         /* Push return address on the
                   * stack and jump to the first
                   * instruction of func*/
...
</pre>


The main code pushes the arguments for func, then calls it. The
call instruction puts the return address on the stack, then moves
on to the func code. <span   class="bold"><b>func</b></span> puts the
four-byte frame pointer immediately following the return address,
then pushes the <b  >p</b> pointer onto the stack. Thus,
if we dump the stack's status now, we get the structure shown in
Figure 2.
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2902f2.large.jpg"><img src="2902f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Stack Structure
</p></div></div>

</p><p>We can use func to print the addresses of
<b  >a</b> and <b  >b</b> in a hexadecimal
format; to do this, we simply add printf instructions:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
void func(int a, int b)
{
 int *p;
 printf("The address of a on the stack is %x\n",
   &amp;a);
 printf("The address of b on the stack is %x\n",
   &amp;b);
}
</pre><p>When we run the modified program, we get the following
output:
<pre     class="programlisting">
The address of a on the stack is bffff7ac
The address of b on the stack is bffff7b0
</pre>


Integer <b  >b</b> is four bytes from integer
<b  >a</b>. Looking at Figure 2, we see that integer
<b  >b</b> is followed by the four-byte frame pointer,
then the four-byte return address.
</p><p>We can look at the return address using the
<b  >disassemble</b> option of
<span   class="bold"><b>gdb</b></span>. (See
<a href="2902l1.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
1</b></span></a>.) The call instruction in
<b  >&lt;main+17&gt;</b> is at address 0x80484b1, which
means the next instruction in 0x80484b6 is the return address. As
we just calculated, when this address is pushed on the stack, it is
offset eight bytes from <b  >b</b> and 12 bytes from
<b  >a</b>.</p><p>Since the stack is writable, we can use the pointer to the
return address, then change its value. By doing so, we manipulate
the normal flow of the program so we can, for example, skip some
instructions. In
<a href="2902l2.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
2</b></span></a>, we have changed the return address so our
program skips an instruction. Compile and execute:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -o ex4 ex4.c
ex4
</pre><p>This output is returned:
<pre     class="programlisting">
The return address is 80484d2
The new return address is 80484dc
Num is now 0
</pre>


In the Listing 2 code, we point to the address of integer
<b  >b</b> with the help of a pointer
<b  >p</b>, then subtract eight bytes down from
<b  >p</b> so it points at the return address printed in
the first output line. Next, we add ten bytes to the return
address, so it skips the <b  >num=1;</b> assembly code.
(<b  >disassemble&nbsp;main</b> shows the exact offset of
the instructions, so I used it to know how many bytes to skip.)
</p><p>In this way, a programmer can regulate the normal flow of his
program from within. The big question is, can someone change this
return address from the outside? The answer is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>sometimes</em></span>. Not only can this address be
changed, but it can also be changed to point to code not within the
program.</p><p><a href="2902l3.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
3</b></span></a> is a very simple program that can be exploited
from the outside. On first execution, the output looks like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bash# ex5
Please enter your input string:
short
This is the next instruction
</pre><p>On second execution, the output is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
bash# ex5
Please enter your input string:
long string
This is the next instruction
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
</pre>


Since <b  >strcpy</b> does not check the length of the
string it copies, we inserted the 12-byte string <b  >long
string\n</b> to a buffer which is eight bytes long. The first
eight characters from my input completely filled the buffer, then
the remaining four characters <span   class="emphasis"><em>overflowed</em></span> the
buffer. That is, these four characters overwrote the adjacent
address in the buffer --the return address. Thus, when func tried
to go back to main, a segmentation fault occurred, since the return
address contained the four-character string
<b  >ing\n</b>, most likely an illegal memory address.
</p><p>The strcpy function is the classical example for buffer
overflow since it does not check the copied string size to ensure
it is within the buffer limits. Note strcpy is not the only way to
exploit a program with a buffer-overflow hack.</p><p>The actual buffer-overflow hack works like this:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Find code with overflow potential.</p></li><li><p>Put the code to be executed in the buffer, i.e., on
the stack.</p></li><li><p>Point the return address to the same code you have
just put on the stack.</p></li></ul></div><p>Since this is not the Linux &ldquo;hack.HOWTO&rdquo;, I will not go
into details on these three stages.
</p><p>The first stage is very easy, especially in a Linux system,
since a huge amount of open-source code applications are available
for Linux. Some of these applications are in use on almost every
Linux system. Good examples of such programs were
<span   class="bold"><b>mount</b></span> and some early versions of
<span   class="bold"><b>innd</b></span>.
<span   class="bold"><b>mount</b></span> did not check the length of
the command-line arguments the user entered and its permissions set
to 4555. <span   class="bold"><b>innd</b></span> did not check all of
the news message headers, so by sending a specific header, a user
could get a remote shell on the server.</p><p>The second stage has two parts. The first one is to find how
to represent the code to be executed; this can be done using a
simple disassembler. The second part depends on where the program
reads the buffer: in some cases, a mail header; in others, an
environment variable whose length goes unchecked; in still others,
some alternate means.</p><p>The third stage is not so simple, as one cannot know the
exact address of the code to be executed. Basically, it is done by
guessing the address until the correct address is found. Several
ways can be used to make this guessing more efficient; thus, after
only a few guesses, we can specify the right address and the code
gets executed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a2580.0x1692cd8"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>The fact that an application is used all over the Web does
not mean it is secure, so take care when installing a new
application on your machine. In fact, WWW applications are more
likely to be searched deeply for security holes by crackers with
bad intent. System administrators should read the security
newsgroup and related web pages in order to keep applications known
to have security holes off the system and to upgrade them when
patches become available. Application programmers should take care
to write tight code containing proper checks for array and variable
lengths in order to foil this type of hack.</p><p>Finally, I would like to briefly mention three other things.
One, a kernel patch is available that makes the stack memory area a
non-executable one. I have never tested it, since applications do
exist which count on the fact that the stack is executable, and
these applications will most likely have problems with this patched
kernel. Two, a special mode to the Intel processor is available
that has the stack grow from the lower memory addresses to the
higher memory addresses, thus making a buffer overflow almost
impossible. Three, a set of libraries available on some systems
helps the programmer write code with no such errors. All the
programmer has to do is tell the library functions the assumptions
about a variable and these functions will verify that the variable
meets the specified criteria.</p></div></div>
