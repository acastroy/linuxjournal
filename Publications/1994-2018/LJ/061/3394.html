of the Perl scripting language, by e-mail on March 1. Larry proved
to be quite voluble, and I think you'll find this interview fun as
well as informative. I certainly did.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Back in the
beginning, what inspired you to write Perl?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: That depends on what
you mean by &ldquo;beginning&rdquo;. Like Moses said: &ldquo;In the beginning, God
created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; I'm not being entirely
facetious about that. Whichever way you care (or don't care) to
interpret scripture, I think the universe is a pretty hefty
inspiration for anyone who aspires to be a creator. I've certainly
tried to put a universe of ideas into Perl, with some amount of
success.</p><p>In terms of biographical beginnings, my father was a pastor,
as were both my grandfathers, and many of my ancestors before that.
My wife likes to say that preachers are bred for intelligence
(though I suppose she might be saying that just to flatter me). Be
that as it may, I did receive a fairly decent set of brain
construction genes. Beyond that, I also received a rich heritage of
ideas and skills, some of which found their way into Perl culture.
For instance, the notion that you can change the world. The idea
that other people are important. The love of communication and an
understanding of rhetoric, not to mention linguistics. The
appreciation of the importance of text. The desire to relate
everything to everything else. The passion to build up rather than
tear down. And, of course, the dead certainty that true wealth is
measured not by what you accumulate, but by what you pass on to
others.</p><p>The beginnings of Perl were directly inspired by running into
a problem I couldn't solve with the tools I had. Or rather, that I
couldn't <span   class="emphasis"><em>easily</em></span> solve. As the Apostle Paul so
succinctly put it, &ldquo;All things are possible, but not all things
are expedient.&rdquo; I could have solved my problem with awk and shell
eventually, but I possess a fortuitous surplus of the three chief
virtues of a programmer: Laziness, Impatience and Hubris. I was too
lazy to do it in awk because it would have been hard to get awk to
jump through the hoops I was wanting it to jump through. I was too
impatient to wait for awk to finish because it was so slow. And
finally, I had the hubris to think I could do better.</p><p>Of course, actually writing something like Perl takes a great
deal of hard work, patience and even humility. Had I just been
doing it for myself, I probably wouldn't have made the effort.
However, I was aware from the beginning that other people were
going to be using Perl, so I've always integrated the &ldquo;laziness
curve&rdquo; over the whole community, not just over myself. I was being
vicariously lazy. So here we are talking about vicars again.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Well, that
certainly answered the question fully. I must admit I didn't expect
you to go back as far as the beginning of the Universe. :-) How'd
you come up with that name?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: I wanted a short name
with positive connotations. (I would never name a language
&ldquo;Scheme&rdquo; or &ldquo;Python&rdquo;, for instance.) I actually looked at every
three- and four-letter word in the dictionary and rejected them
all. I briefly toyed with the idea of naming it after my wife,
Gloria, but that promised to be confusing on the domestic front.
Eventually I came up with the name &ldquo;pearl&rdquo;, with the gloss
Practical Extraction <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> Report Language. The
&ldquo;a&rdquo; was still in the name when I made that one up. But I heard
rumors of some obscure graphics language named &ldquo;pearl&rdquo;, so I
shortened it to &ldquo;perl&rdquo;. (The &ldquo;a&rdquo; had already disappeared by the
time I gave Perl its alternate gloss, Pathologically Eclectic
Rubbish Lister.)</p><p>Another interesting tidbit is that the name &ldquo;perl&rdquo; wasn't
capitalized at first. UNIX was still very much a lower-case-only OS
at the time. In fact, I think you could call it an anti-upper-case
OS. It's a bit like the folks who start posting on the Net and
affect not to capitalize anything. Eventually, most of them come
back to the point where they realize occasional capitalization is
useful for efficient communication. In Perl's case, we realized
about the time of Perl 4 that it was useful to distinguish between
&ldquo;perl&rdquo; the program and &ldquo;Perl&rdquo; the language. If you find a first
edition of the Camel Book, you'll see that the title was
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming perl</em></span>, with a small &ldquo;p&rdquo;.
Nowadays, the title is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming
Perl</em></span>.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Okay, is Perl
perfect now or do you continue to do further development?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: Hmm, the two are not
mutually exclusive. Look at Linux. :-)</p><p>Actually, Perl was never designed to be perfect. It was
designed to evolve, to become more adaptive, as they say. There is
no such thing as a perfect organism, biologically speaking. About
the most you can say is an organism is more or less suited for the
environment in which it finds itself. In fact, biologists are just
now realizing that any organism which seems to be &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; for
one environment is likely to be in danger of extinction as soon as
the environment changes. Over-specialization is only as good as
your ecological niche. We're not just talking about dinosaurs here,
but also snail darters and cheetahs and a bazillion beetles in
Brazil&mdash;not to mention Visual Basic.</p><p>We've already seen the deaths of many over-specialized
organisms in computing: Lisp machines, Ada chips and many so-called
fourth generation languages. Any program ever written in assembly
language for an obsolete architecture is now obsolete. Likewise,
any program that ties its fortunes to a single operating system is
likely to go down with the ship. I don't know how many more
torpedoes Windows can take before it sinks, but if and when it
does, a whole batch of specialized programs are going down with it.
Obviously, for reasons relating to the open source movement, Linux
doesn't have this particular problem.</p><p>Anyway, back to Perl. Right from the start, Perl was designed
for change. This involves certain tradeoffs, some of which appear
to be suboptimal to people who don't think the way I think. For
instance, I wanted to be able to add new keywords to Perl without
breaking old programs, so I put them into a separate namespace from
variable names. This meant either variable names or keywords had to
be marked somehow as special. I chose to mark variables, since it
also made it easy to interpolate variables into strings, and since
there's a history of marking variables in computer languages such
as BASIC. Note this was actually non-adaptive in certain
environments, namely in the minds of certain purists who think the
added punctuation makes Perl ugly, and too much like BASIC. Well,
maybe it does. So what? That was a conscious tradeoff so that Perl
would be more useful in the long run. In that respect, Perl is less
adaptive in the specific ecological niche comprising the minds of
computer scientists, but more adaptive in the world as a whole.
I've never regretted that particular tradeoff.</p><p>Of course, once you get past first impressions, there are
many things in Perl that computer scientists do like, such as
lexically scoped variables and closures. So by and large, those
computer scientists who can hold their nose long enough to get the
cheese into their mouths find the taste bearable.</p><p>More importantly, Perl 5 introduced an extension system that,
much like Linux's module system, allows continued development of
the language without actually changing the core language. That is,
you can pull in a Perl module that warps the language to your
purposes in a controlled fashion. If a module becomes popular
enough, we can consider making it part of the core of
Perl&mdash;maybe.</p><p>That's not to say we never change the core anymore. We
recently added support for multi-threading and for Unicode.
Interestingly, even when we do make changes to the core these days,
we make it look as though the programmer is pulling in an extension
module. Essentially, if you use a fancy new core feature that warps
the semantics in some way, you have to declare it. This is how we
maintain almost complete compatibility with older Perl scripts.
Most Perl 1 scripts still run unchanged under Perl 5. As a side
benefit, feature declarations are right up front where the
dependency is visible at compile time, so we rarely die in the
middle of execution for lack of a feature. Compare this with shell
programming, where you don't even know whether all the programs
you're intending to invoke actually exist until you try to run
them, and then, kablooey!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What are your
future development plans for Perl?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: If I could predict
that, I'd be a smarter person than I am. I'm just smart enough to
know I'm no smarter than that, which is why I designed Perl to
evolve in the first place.</p><p>That being said, I can tell you some of the characteristics I
look for in a project.</p><p>First, if it has anything to do with text processing, Perl is
a natural. Perl has never stopped being a text-processing language,
though it long ago escaped the straitjacket of being
<span   class="emphasis"><em>just</em></span> a text processing language. That's one
reason Perl was a natural for CGI programming, because Perl excels
at ripping text apart and putting it back together.</p><p>Second, I look for projects that involve gluing things
together. We don't use glue on Legos&mdash;we glue together things that
weren't designed to go together. As a glue language, Perl has thin
characteristics so that it can flow into tiny gaps, and thick
characteristics so that it can fill in larger voids. Perl is always
at home in the interstices. The typical CGI script or mod_perl
servlet glues a database together with the Web. When that
particular interstice disappears, there will be other
interstices.</p><p>Third, I look for projects that franchise the
disenfranchised. We joke about sending our leftovers to the
starving people in Africa, but there are, in fact, billions of
potential programmers outside of America who can't afford to lay
out hundreds of bucks for an operating system or an application.
China recently put in a single order for 200,000 Internet books
from a publisher I know (and work for). That's just the beginning.
This is why I hacked Unicode support into Perl last year. Of
course, text processing has something to do with Unicode
too.</p><p>Having said all that, it almost doesn't matter what I look
for in my next development project, because I don't do most of the
Perl development these days. The Perl community outweighs me by
many orders of magnitude, and they're really the ones who are
making Perl the be-all and end-all of scripting languages. I just
sit on the sidelines and cheer occasionally. I'm cheering now. Rah,
rah, rah! :-)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: In what way is
Perl better than other scripting languages such as Python and
Eiffel?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: Perl is unique, not
just among scripting languages, but among computer languages in
general. It's the only computer language consciously and explicitly
designed to be postmodern. All other computer languages are still
stuck in the modern era to some degree. Now, as it happens, I don't
normally use the term &ldquo;postmodern&rdquo; to describe Perl, because most
people don't really understand postmodernism, even as they embrace
it. But the fact is that American culture has become thoroughly
postmodern, not just in music and literature, but also in fashion,
architecture and in overall multicultural awareness.</p><p>Modernism was based on a kind of arrogance, a set of
monocultural blinders that elevated originality above all else, and
led designers to believe that if they thought of something cool, it
must be considered universally cool. That is, if something's worth
doing, it's worth driving into the ground to the exclusion of all
other approaches. Look at the use of parentheses in Lisp or the use
of white space as syntax in Python. Or the mandatory use of objects
in many languages, including Java. All of these are ways of taking
freedom away from the end user &ldquo;for their own good&rdquo;. They're just
versions of Orwell's Newspeak, in which it's impossible to think
bad thoughts. We escaped from the fashion police in the 1970s, but
many programmers are still slaves of the cyber police.</p><p>In contrast, postmodernism allows for cultural and personal
context in the interpretation of any work of art. How you dress is
your business. It's the origin of the Perl slogan: &ldquo;There's More
Than One Way To Do It!&rdquo; The reason Perl gives you more than one
way to do anything is this: I truly believe computer programmers
want to be creative, and they may have many different reasons for
wanting to write code a particular way. What you choose to optimize
for is your concern, not mine. I just supply the paint&mdash;you paint
the picture.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Who is using Perl
and how are they using it?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: A couple of years
ago, I ran into someone at a trade show who was representing the
NSA (National Security Agency). He mentioned to someone else in
passing that he'd written a filter program in Perl, so without
telling him who I was, I asked him if I could tell people that the
NSA uses Perl. His response was, &ldquo;Doesn't everyone?&rdquo; So now I
don't tell people the NSA uses Perl. I merely tell people the NSA
<span   class="emphasis"><em>thinks</em></span> everyone uses Perl. They should know,
after all.</p><p>As an interesting side note, it turned out this fellow was
the very administrator who shut down the NSA project Perl was
(indirectly) written to support. He was vaguely amused when I
pointed out Perl might well be the most enduring legacy of the
project.</p><p>As to what everyone uses Perl for, it's really all over the
map. I was astounded several years ago to be told how heavily Perl
is used on Wall Street. &ldquo;A Perl book on every other desk&rdquo; is how
I heard it. But it makes sense when you realize that market
analysts need to revise their models continually, and they need to
scan news services for information that might be related to their
positions in the market. Rapid prototyping and text processing are
what they need.</p><p>Many people associate Perl with CGI scripts, though of course
most of the heavy lifting is done with mod_perl servlets under
Apache. Perl is used just as much on the client side in the robots
and spiders that navigate the Web and build much of the linkage
implicit in various on-line databases. And that's not all. If
you've ever been spammed (and who hasn't?), your e-mail address was
almost certainly gleaned from the Net using a Perl script. The spam
itself was likely sent via a Perl script. One could say that Perl
is the language of choice for Net abuse. And one could almost be
proud of it.</p><p>That's only scratching the surface of what Perl is used for.
Without getting Mr. Gallup or the U.S. Census Bureau involved, the
best way to figure out what Perl is used for is to look at the 800
or so reusable extension modules in the Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network (the CPAN, for short). If you glance through those modules,
you'll get the impression that Perl has interfaces to almost
everything in the world. With a little thought, you may figure out
the reason Perl has interfaces to everything is not so much so Perl
itself can talk to everything, but so Perl can get everything in
the world talking to everything else in the world. The
combinatorics are staggering. The very first issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Perl Journal</em></span> (not to be confused with <i  >Linux Journal</i>) contained an article entitled &ldquo;How Perl Saved
the Human Genome Project&rdquo;. It explains how all the different
genome sequencing laboratories used different databases with
different formats, and how Perl was used to massage the data into a
cohesive whole.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: We received a
product announcement for PerlDirect from ActiveState Tool
Corporation that says:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;PerlDirect provides reliability, stability,
support and accountability for Perl through the following features:
validated, quality-assured releases of Perl and its popular
extensions; advice and support; Y2K test suite; and a Perl Alert
weekly bulletin. PerlDirect offers an opportunity to provide direct
input to a leading organization involved in open-source
development. Basic annual subscription rates start at $12,000
US.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Are you affiliated with this company? I think it's
interesting they are offering to let a subscriber have direct input
to open-source development for $12,000 a year. Does this make
sense?</em></span>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: Sounds like a pretty
ordinary support contract to me. I don't think even Richard
Stallman would disagree with the notion that support is a valid way
to make money off free software.</p><p>I'm not directly affiliated with ActiveState, but I've worked
with them, and I think the problems they've solved far outweigh any
problems they've created. You've got to understand their market has
always been the Windows space, where you're actually doing people a
favor by charging them money for things, because that's the only
way to keep from confusing them. Linux users are smarter than this,
of course, but some Linux users aren't quite smart enough to
realize Windows is a different culture, and Perl, being a
postmodern language that is sensitive to context, will look
different in a different culture.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Oops, didn't mean
to sound as if I thought they weren't on the up-and-up&mdash;just
curious if you knew them. What are your views of the Open Source
movement? Do you think it will become a true phenomenon, or is it
just a passing fancy?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: I must have a
conjunctive rather than a disjunctive brain, because I think both
of those notions are true. And I also think they're both false.
:-)</p><p>How can we claim open source is becoming a true phenomenon
when it has already been a true phenomenon for a couple of decades
now? We're merely pointing out to everyone a practice that has a
proven track record of producing excellent code. On the other hand,
we're certainly trying to make it a <span   class="emphasis"><em>truer</em></span>
phenomenon, in the sense that we hope more people will feel it's a
valid development model for many kinds of software that were
formerly developed under a closed model.</p><p>And, of course, it's a passing fancy&mdash;just as we've had other
passing fancies for free-form syntax, structured programming, and
more recently, object orientation.</p><p>What you have to understand is that, from the viewpoint of
the passing fancy, people represent a kind of fork in the road.
It's like separating the sheep from the goats in the book of
Revelation. Some of these fancies pass on the one side and go into
oblivion, while others pass on the other side and go into common
practice, usually after a period of excessive enthusiasm. Free-form
syntax, structured programming and object orientation are all good
(in moderation). But note that all of these passing fancies had a
history of being useful before they became popular. The passing
fancies that go into oblivion are the ones rooted not in history,
but rather in someone's wishful thinking (usually someone from
marketing). By this criterion, open source will probably go into
common practice because it's already in common practice.</p><p>The way I see it, the open source movement is just another
manifestation of the growing postmodernism of our culture. By
contrast, the notion of trade secrecy is just a rehash of the
modernistic idea of originality at any cost. We've had a lot of lip
service given to code reuse over the years, but it really only
works with open source. A postmodern computer programmer truly
believes in reusing good code whether it's original or not. It's
not a point of pride anymore. A good postmodern is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>supposed</em></span> to plagiarize the things he or she
thinks are cool.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: If everything
becomes open source, how will programmers make a living?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: Contrary to many open
source advocates, I don't see everything becoming open source. What
I do see is a growing recognition that anything resembling
large-scale infrastructure ought to be open source, much as the
United States has recognized that interstate highways should not be
toll roads. On the other hand, we don't expect city parking lots to
be free except in certain enlightened municipalities. So I'd expect
to see Windows become open source before Word does.</p><p>That being said, there are many ways to make a living off
open source, just as there are many ways to make a living off open
<span   class="emphasis"><em>science</em></span>. But here's precisely where I think
the open source movement has some growing to do. Open science
basically started out as a hobby of the rich, but it didn't truly
blossom into the form we recognize today until its patronage was
taken over by educational institutions. This has not quite happened
yet with open source. Or rather, it started to happen, but then
many educational institutions got caught up in the drive for the
almighty dollar. I wish more places would follow the example of UC
Berkeley.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: On that note, how
do you make a living?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: To start off, I
worked programming and sys admin jobs like anyone else and did my
free software on the side. Later, I wrote a book and started
collecting royalties. The book became a best-seller, so it made my
publisher, O'Reilly &amp; Associates, even more money than it made
me. Of course, they have to pay more people with that money, so it
evens out.</p><p>Anyway, three years ago it occurred to Tim O'Reilly and me
that anything good for Perl was also good for O'Reilly &amp;
Associates, so now they pay me to do whatever I like, as long as it
helps Perl. It's been a good symbiosis.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Any interesting
projects you'd like to tell us about?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: I'm supposed to be
working on the third edition of the Camel Book, so I don't
officially have any other interesting projects at the moment. Of
course, I <span   class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> been playing around with that
Palm Pilot Tim O'Reilly gave me for Christmas, but I won't tell if
you won't.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Agreed. Give us
some personal info&mdash;where you went to school, interests,
etc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: I spent the first
half my childhood in south Los Angeles about two miles from where
the Watts riots broke out, and the second half of my childhood in
Bremerton, Washington, where no riots broke out, but I did graduate
from high school. For the third half of my childhood, I went to
Seattle Pacific University, where I started off majoring in
chemistry and music, later switched to premed, and eventually
(after taking several years off to work in the SPU computer center)
ended up majoring in Natural and Artificial Languages (a
self-designed major). After that, my wife and I attended grad
school in linguistics at Berkeley and UCLA. At the time, we were
actually planning to be missionaries (more specifically, Bible
translators), but we had to drop that idea for health reasons.
Funny thing is, now the missionaries probably get more good out of
Perl than they'd have gotten out of me as a missionary. Go
figure.</p><p>As for my interests, that's hard, because I tend to be
interested in anything that's interesting. Which comes out to
pretty much anything except opera and soap opera&mdash;space opera's
okay, though.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What do you do for
fun?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: Read and listen to my
wife read to me (especially space opera). Discuss anything and
everything with anyone and everyone in my family. Work <span   class="emphasis"><em>NY
Times</em></span> crossword puzzles. Play mah jong. Practice aikido.
Watch anime. (Maybe Japanese soap opera is okay.) Play with my
fish. Rescue my fish from the equipment I bought to keep them
alive.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Looks like you
stay busy and have fun&mdash;a good combination. What do you eat for
breakfast?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: I eat all kinds of
things for breakfast&mdash;but then, I generally eat breakfast at
lunchtime.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Seems as good a
time as any. Thanks for giving us so much of your time. It's been
interesting.</p></div></div>
