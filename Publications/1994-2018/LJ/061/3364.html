smallest web server using new technology from Jumptec Industrial
Computers. Professor Vaughan Pratt used the DIMM-PC/486 from
JUMPTec, which measures 40 x 68 mm (1.57 x 2.68 inches).
DIMM-PC/486 has the same capabilities as a standard 486 PC and is
much faster than a Palm Pilot. Small enough to be worn in a shirt
pocket, Pratt's DIMM-PC web server sports a 66 MHz CPU, 16MB of RAM
and 16MB flash ROM&mdash;big enough to hold Red Hat 5.2 Linux and run
the HTTP daemon. To learn more, visit
