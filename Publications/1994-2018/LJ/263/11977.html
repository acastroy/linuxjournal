A success story of how a PACS server ends up in a tiny initrd.

Those of you who have tried it will agree with me on the benefits
of using an initrd/initramfs as a real root filesystem and of the
possibility of not using a hard disk drive (HDD) in your servers. If you
haven't tried it,
I invite you to continue reading.
</p><p>
If you don't already know, initrd/initramfs is a scheme to load a temporary
root filesystem into RAM. initrd and initramfs refer to two different
methods of achieving this. Both are commonly used to make preparations
before the real root filesystem can be mounted. Years ago, initramfs
didn't exist, and everyone used initrd. Today, people continue using initrd.
</p><p>
But at my workplace, instead of using initrd as a temporary root filesystem,
we use initrd as the real root filesystem. That's why in many of
our servers we don't need an HDD&mdash;everything is in RAM. The only data
stored in the HDD is that which may vary from boot to boot and needs
to be preserved. That's the case of a database in which we put the
PostgreSQL/MySQL binaries and libraries into the initrd and only the
data files into the HDD.
</p><p>
Having a basic tiny initrd/initramfs, to which we can add anything needed
for each system, with a tiny custom kernel, and booting them with PXE
has saved us more than one catastrophe and makes our work easier.
</p><p>
The advantages of using initrd/initramfs are considerable:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>RAM:</b></span> memory is cheaper, faster, less

initrd as a Real Root Filesystem</h2></div></div><p>
One of the reasons administrators don't use initrd as a real
root filesystem is because they know that changes will disappear
when restarting the server if they are not incorporated into the
initrd. The steps for doing this are annoying: uncompressing the initrd file,
mounting the filesystem, making changes, unmounting, compressing and
restarting the server to take the new changes.
</p><p>
To work around this issue, we consider an initrd as a good enough
filesystem when there's almost no need for modifying it.
</p><p>
In order to achieve this, we put files known to be susceptible to changes
over time outside the initrd. These files normally are configuration
files of services, scripts and files inside the /etc directory, such as
ethers, resolv.conf or hosts.allow. These files are stored in our
TFTP/SSH server. When the server boots, it gets its kernel and initrd,
and then copies all these files via SSH.
</p><p>
For example, think of a caching proxy server. If you have a minimal basic
initrd, you need to put only the libraries and binaries into it. But, the
configuration file should be copied remotely from a different server
where it can be modified in an easier way than having to modify the
whole initrd filesystem.
</p><p>
All of these initrds, kernels and configuration files for each server are
stored in our TFTP server. This server has DHCP, SSH and PXE services
installed. When a server boots, it gets its kernel and initrd files from
the TFTP server and the configuration files via SSH.
</p><p>
There's no need to restart the server with every change we make; we just
edit the file on the TFTP server, get it with sshfs or rsync into the
proxy server and restart the proxy service.
</p><p>
Perhaps a graphic will make it easier to understand&mdash;see
Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11977f1.large.jpg"><img src="11977f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Here's an example of a proxy server with initrd as a real root
filesystem. 1) 
Configure the proxy server BIOS to boot with PXE and configure the DHCP
service to tell this server the IP of the TFTP server.
2) Configure the PXE service in the TFTP server to serve the kernel and
initrd files to the proxy server.
3) The proxy server knows the IP of the TFTP server and asks it for
the kernel and initrd files.
4) The proxy server boots and executes the /etc/rc script. This script mounts
a directory of the TFTP server via SSHFS and copies the configuration files.

Introduction to the PACS Server</h2></div></div><p>
At my workplace, we have many servers without HDDs that get their kernels
and initrds from a TFTP server and then copy their configuration
files. We also have some servers with HDDs to store critical data,
such as database files, but they also boot with PXE. And when you see
that it works magnificently, you will want to implement it on as many
servers as possible.
</p><p>
And, this is the reason why this story began&mdash;the story of an uncommon
server that finally ends in a tiny initrd.
</p><p>
A PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication
System) is a system that stores all kind of digital medical
images, so other computers can consult them later. The
universal format for PACS image storage and transfer is DICOM (Digital
Imaging and Communications in Medicine). DICOM enables the integration
of scanners, servers, workstations, printers and network hardware
from multiple manufacturers into a picture archiving and communication
system. At my workplace, we use dcm4chee for such purposes because it's
very powerful.
</p><p>
We administer a university dental clinic with 56 medical boxes, each one
equipped with a workstation that allows users to view and upload radiological
images. These sorts of images also are generated and uploaded from
different kinds of scanners: intraoral, 2D/3D and CAT. For medical and
academic purposes, teachers and students can work and do research from
a lab classroom equipped with 15 workstations. Even though the images come
from different manufacturers' equipment, all of them are stored in the
same format (the DICOM standard) and in a unique repository, a PACS
server.
</p><p>
The images are stored in a big disk array with 10TB connected with fiber
to the PACS server, with all the image data (date, modality, description)
and patient information (unique ID, name, sex, birth date) in the database. We
have more than 50,000 patients stored right now.
</p><p>
We also have a DICOM Worklist service in the PACS server. This reduces
operator search time, and it allows for a list of cited patients on a
certain 
day to be consulted from any computer and uploads images only
for those patients.
</p><p>
With the DICOM Worklist, it's easier to search and upload images for
the correct patient, because if you search for a patient ID that is not in
the DICOM Worklist, it will not appear in the list, and you won't be
able to upload a patient image that is not in the DICOM Worklist. The
possibilities of uploading an image for the wrong patient is significantly
reduced.
</p><p>
The clinical management software runs on a cluster of Web servers and
allows us to list all the patients, their personal data and medical
exams, and to view and create their diagnoses or treatments.
</p><p>
This is interesting: this cluster has eight servers. Seven of them run all in
RAM without HDDs, except one, which has an HDD only for the database. Only
the TFTP server boots from HDD, because it is the TFTP server of the cluster and
has all the kernels, initrds and configuration files of all the other
servers in the cluster.
</p><p>
Five years ago, we mounted two PACS servers in Linux. Because of the
complexity and the little knowledge that we had, we didn't create initrds
for them.
</p><p>
These two PACS servers are PACS-Master and PACS-HA (high
availability). Both have a big disk array attached with 10TB to store
the images. When someone uploads an image, PACS-Master saves it and
sends all the records and images to the PACS-HA. If the PACS-Master
has a problem and doesn't respond, the keepalived service gives the
control to PACS-HA.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2542580.0x263b6f0"></a>
PACS Server to RAM</h2></div></div><p>
Through the years, we have had to change the HDD of PACS-Master twice
because of
failures. We have backups of the database and an image of the whole HDD,
but the size of the image is very large, and with the new changes, we
needed to create it again. That is not KISS.
</p><p>
We decided to upgrade the server to 64-bit, creating a minimal initrd,
upgrading the dcm4chee version and the old database, importing the images
and studying how dcm4chee and the DICOM Worklist work to know which files
would be included in the initrd and which ones into the HDD.
</p><p>
Table 1 shows the specifications of both the old 32-bit server and the new 64-bit
one of PACS-Initrd.

I'm not going to go into how to create an initrd or how to
upgrade dcm4chee here; those topics are more technical and beyond the scope
of this article.
</p><p>
The real difficulty was learning how the dcm4chee and DICOM Worklist services
operate and which files had to be located in the initrd and which ones
in the HDD. Because initrd is a block device with a limited size, if
you have files that grow over time and exceed that size, you'll get a
kernel panic.
</p><p>
For example, think of a directory that you know a service uses and
that contains files that increase in size over time. You only need
to create in the initrd a symbolic link with 
<tt  >ln -s</tt> to the HDD:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@pacs1 /dcm4chee/server/default]$ ls -la | grep tmp
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root   38 Mar 13 17:27 tmp -&gt; /HD/dcm4chee/tmp/
</pre>
</p><p>
It's important to remember that if you change the HDD, you also 
need to create the directories again, or the symbolic link will be broken.
</p><p>
When we got the job done after months of work and tests, we got a kernel
of 2.2MB and an initrd of 204MB compressed, 420MB uncompressed. Normally,
our initrds occupy less than 100MB uncompressed. You might think that
this initrd is not very tiny, but keep in mind that only the size of the
dcm4chee and the DICOM Worklist occupies 80% of the total size.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2542580.0x2632f50"></a>
Into the initrd and HDD</h2></div></div><p>
We have incorporated all these applications and services into our tiny
initrd filesystem:
PostgreSQL, Postfix mail server, NTP, SNMP, syslog, OpenSSH, Keepalived,
cron, dcm4chee, DICOM Worklist and Java 6.
Consider that all of those services don't start
on the HDD; they do it in RAM!
</p><p>
We have incorporated these data files into our HDDs:
the database, the dcm4chee and the DICOM Worklist files that increase in
size over time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2542580.0x2633108"></a>
PACS-Initrd at Startup</h2></div></div><p>
The PACS-Initrd boots first from Ethernet, so we enable PXE boot in the BIOS. We
add an entry for this server in DHCP and the IP of its TFTP server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[root@tftp-server /]# cat /etc/dhcpd.conf | grep -i pacs1 -A 5
host pacs1 {
            hardware ethernet xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx;
            fixed-address 10.0.0.12;
            filename "pxelinux.0";
            next-server 10.0.0.1;
           }
</pre>
</p><p>
We configure the PXE service in the TFTP server to serve the kernel and initrd
to PACS-Initrd:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[root@tftp-server /]# cat /tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/pacs
prompt 1 
timeout 5
default L
label L
kernel kernels/kernel-2.6-64-pacs
append rw root=/dev/ram0 load_ramdisk=1 ramdisk_size=524288
 &#8618;initrd=initrd/fs-pacs.gz 
 &#8618;ip=10.0.0.12:10.0.0.1:10.0.0.7:255.255.0.0:pacs1
ipappend 1
</pre>
</p><p>
PACS-Initrd starts with that kernel and initrd files and executes
the /etc/rc script. This script mounts a directory of the TFTP server via SSHFS
and copies all the configuration files that are often
modified into the PACS-Initrd, such as Keepalived, PostgreSQL, the 
/etc directory or cron, and unmounts the directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "Getting config files via SSHFS ..."
sshfs user@10.0.0.1:/servers/ /mnt

/bin/cp -aL /mnt/pacs/db /
/bin/cp -aL /mnt/pacs/etc/* /etc/
/bin/cp -aL /mnt/pacs/home/sysman/* /home/sysman/
/bin/cp -aL /mnt/pacs/root /
/bin/cp -aL /mnt/pacs/var/* /var/
/bin/umount /mnt

/etc/rc.local
</pre>
</p><p>
PACS-Initrd executes /etc/rc.local and launches all the services.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2542580.0x2633420"></a>
Creating a High-Availability PACS Server</h2></div></div><p>
We waited a few months before changing the PACS-HA to an initrd
filesystem. During that time, PACS-Initrd worked perfectly without
problems. We had no complaints from our users&mdash;and as you know, no news is
good news.
</p><p>
Once we had an initial initrd, creating PACS-Initrd-HA was done in 15
minutes (not taking into account the time needed to import and upgrade
the old database). We added the new server in DHCP for it to attack the TFTP
server and download the same kernel and the same initrd from PACS-Initrd.
</p><p>
Some services needed different configuration files for each PACS server,
so the solution was to create new configuration files in the 
/servers/pacs/ directory of the TFTP server.
For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[root@tftp-server /servers/pacs/etc]# ls -la | grep keepalived
-rw-rw-r--  1 root root  552 Mar  7 11:24 keepalived-pacs1.conf
-rw-rw-r--  1 root root  551 Mar  7 11:24 keepalived-pacs2.conf
</pre>
</p><p>
In order to avoid having two different directories for both PACS servers,
we configured /etc/rc.local to choose the appropriate configuration
files for each PACS server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[root@pacs1 /]$ cat /etc/rc.local
#!/bin/bash

echo -e "\n--- rc.local ------"

echo "Some extra configuration ..."
HOSTNAME=`/bin/hostname`

echo "Configurations for $HOSTNAME ..."
case $HOSTNAME in
    "pacs1" | "pacs2")
        mv /home/sysman/host-$HOSTNAME.conf /home/sysman/host.conf;
        rm /home/sysman/host-*.conf;
        mv /etc/postfix/main-$HOSTNAME.cf /etc/postfix/main.cf;
        rm /etc/postfix/main-*.cf;
        mv /etc/keepalived-$HOSTNAME.conf /etc/keepalived.conf;
        rm /etc/keepalived-*.conf;
        ;;
    *)
        echo "ERROR in HOSTNAME ($HOSTNAME) ...";
        exit -1;
        ;;
esac
</pre>
</p><p>
Then we formatted an HDD partition in ext4, initialized the database,
imported and upgraded the old database of PACS-HA and created the
directories that come with a symbolic link from initrd.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2542580.0x2633738"></a>
Other Configurations</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Security:</b></span>
</p><p>
We secured the common binaries with <tt  >chattr</tt> with the
-i (immutable) option.
An intruder gaining access won't be allowed to change a common binary
for a rootkit because it has the immutable attribute. And, of course, our
initrd doesn't own the chattr binary.
</p><p>
We configured TCP wrappers to deny all SSH connections except the ones
needed by the servers to communicate with the PACS server.
</p><p>
We configured the ethers
file with a static MAC to prevent a MITM (Man-In-the-Middle) attack.
</p><p>
We configured snmpd.conf to deny all queries except ones coming from our monitor
server.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Centralized Logs:</b></span>
</p><p>
We configured syslog to send all logs to another server that has the
syslog-ng service running.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Backup:</b></span>
</p><p>
At night, our backup server backs up the database and the configuration
of the dcm4chee service.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Internal Monitoring:</b></span>
</p><p>
We use SMART (Smart Monitoring and Rebooting Tool) for such purposes,
because it's not only a passive monitor, but it's also an active monitor
that can auto-recover a service without the system administrator's
intervention if it detects that it's down.
</p><p>
We added dcm4chee and the DICOM Worklist services to SMART.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11977f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

External Monitoring</h2></div></div><p>
We monitor the server behavior and status with SNMP and Zabbix. We
also monitor the services with Nagios.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11977f3.large.jpg"><img src="11977f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The benefits of doing this are considerable.
We saw in Zabbix that performance improved substantially.
Backups are simple because the size of the initrd is minuscule, and it's
easier to have a copy compared with a whole system image of the HDD. And,
we
need to back up only one initrd, because PACS-Initrd and PACS-Initrd-HA
use the same one.
If any file is corrupted or accidentally deleted, the solution is just to restart the server, and it'll wake up again in a healthy state
without having to re-install the whole OS.
If the HDD gets broken, it will be easy to recover, because it stores
only the database and the configuration files and not the whole OS.
If the hardware breaks down, we just have to replace it and add a new
server in DHCP and a MAC entry in the TFTP server.
The server's security is improved, because if we restart the server,
any changes made by viruses, worms or rootkits will disappear.
Mounting a second PACS server was easy, because we already had the initial
initrd. The most time-consuming part was creating the configuration files,
adding a few lines in rc.local and a new entry in the DHCP service.
</p><p>
I hope this article helps you consider the benefits of having
a server starting with PXE, and I encourage you to do it on many of your
servers.
