In my last article, I did what business writers would call a &ldquo;deep
dive&rdquo;
into <tt  >getopts</tt> and different ways to parse starting flags and arguments in
shell scripts. I know you've tested that in your latest programs,
which is great, because it's something that you could find yourself
using quite a lot.
</p><p>
In this article, I'm covering something that's a bit more
abstruse: converting numeric bases within shell scripts. There are
really four commonly used numeric bases to consider: binary, octal,
decimal and hexadecimal. You're used to working in base-10, so 10 =
1 * 10**1 + 0 and 100 = 1 * 10**2 + 0 * 10**1 + 0.
</p><p>
That maps to other numeric bases, so 1010 base-2 or binary is really 1 *
2**3 + 0 * 2**2 + 1 * 2**1 + 0 or 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10 decimal. Octal is
the same thing, so 33 base-8 converts to decimal as 3 * 8**1 + 3 = 27.
</p><p>
Hexadecimal presents a different challenge because a base-16
numbering system doesn't fit neatly into our Arabic numerals 0, 1, 2,
... 9. &ldquo;Hex&rdquo;, as it's known informally, adds A, B, C, D, E and F,
so that the decimal value 10 is represented in Hex as &ldquo;A&rdquo;.
That's
where the math gets interesting, so 33 base-16 = 3 * 16**1 + 3 = 48 +
3 = 51.
</p><p>
The long, complicated way to create a base conversion utility is
therefore to disassemble every value given and apply the translation
shown, then have an internal value that's a common base (probably
base-10), then have another routine that converts the common base to
the desired output base.
</p><p>
There are smarter ways to do this, as I'll discuss, but for now,
let's look at the <tt  >bc</tt> command, which supports users specifying both
the input and output numeric bases. <tt  >bc</tt>, the binary calculator, is a bit
tricky to work with as it's an old-school UNIX command. As I discuss
at length in my book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wicked Cool Shell Scripts</em></span>, the most common way to
work with the crude but interactive <tt  >bc</tt> program is
to use <tt  >echo</tt> to send
it the commands needed, as demonstrated here:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo '333 * 0.35' | bc
116.55
</pre>
</p><p>
Useful (particularly since <tt  >expr</tt> and <tt  >$((
))</tt> can't work with floats and
decimal values), but where this gets really interesting is with those
input and output numeric bases.
</p><p>
Let's say I want to confirm a conversion I listed earlier, by
converting 33 hex into decimal. This is easily done:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo 'ibase=16; 33' | bc
51
</pre>
</p><p>
That's simple. Now, let's do something bigger and more complicated:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo 'ibase=16; FEF33D9' | bc
267334617
</pre>
</p><p>
<tt  >ibase</tt> is the input numeric base. The output base is specified as
<tt  >obase</tt>. And that's it&mdash;easy enough!
</p><p>
So let's take the same hex value as input but force the output to
octal instead of the default decimal:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo 'ibase=16; obase=8; FEF33D9' | bc
1773631731
</pre>
</p><p>
Would you rather work in binary? You can do that too:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo 'ibase=16; obase=2; FEF33D9' | bc
1111111011110011001111011001
</pre>
</p><p>
That's a lot of ones and zeroes, for sure. It makes me think of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Interstellar</em></span>, but that's another article
entirely!
</p><p>
Armed with this knowledge, it's pretty easy to push out a rudimentary
shell script that converts between any of binary, octal, decimal and
hexadecimal:

<pre     class="programlisting">

ibase=10; obase=10		# set up defaults
usage() {
  echo "Usage: $(basename $0) -i base -o base value" 1&gt;&amp;2
  echo "  where base can be 2, 8, 10 or 16." 1&gt;&amp;2
  exit 1
}
while getopts "i:o:" value ; do
  case "$value" in
    i) ibase=$OPTARG
       (( ibase == 2 || ibase == 8 || ibase == 10 || 
          ibase == 16 )) || usage
       ;;
    o) obase=$OPTARG
       (( obase == 2 || obase == 8 || obase == 10 || 
          obase == 16 )) || usage
       ;;
    *) usage ;;
  esac
done
shift $(( OPTIND - 1 ))

echo Converting $1 from base-$ibase to base-$obase\:
echo "obase=$obase; ibase=$ibase; $1" | bc
exit 0

</pre>
</p><p>
Almost the entire program is involved with parsing and checking
input values, which isn't that uncommon with well written shell
scripts. Notice some shortcuts I include in the script too, notably the
test structure:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(( condition || condition )) || usage
</pre>
</p><p>
This is the same as saying &ldquo;if not condition1 and not condition 2 ; then
; usage&rdquo;, just more succinct. Also, as I discussed in my last
article, note the
use of <tt  >OPTARG</tt> to get the argument value and
<tt  >OPTIND</tt> with the <tt  >shift</tt> command
to axe all of the parameters so that <tt  >$1</tt> will be the value to convert.
</p><p>
A few quick runs of the program reveal that it's working fine:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ bconvert.sh -i 16 33
Converting 33 from base-16 to base-10:
51
$ bconvert.sh -i 16 -o 2  33
Converting 33 from base-16 to base-2:
110011
$ bconvert.sh -i 2 -o 16 110011
Converting 110011 from base-2 to base-16:
33
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice the last two examples demonstrate the mirror function of converting
between 33 base-16 and 110011 base-2. It works!
</p><p>
A common numeric notation in the Linux world is to recognize that numbers
prefaced with a zero are octal, and those prefaced with &ldquo;0x&rdquo; are
hexadecimal. (Binary isn't particularly useful so it's not included
in the common notation.) Here are a few examples: 0700, 0xFFc39. You could modify
the script to accept these as inputs and infer the appropriate base,
but I'm going to leave that as an exercise for you, dear reader.
</p><p>
There's another way you can convert values without involving
<tt  >bc</tt>&mdash;by utilizing the
<tt  >printf</tt> command-line program. If you know C programming,
you're already familiar with <tt  >printf()</tt> and
<tt  >scanf()</tt>, but unfortunately,
only the output function is available at the shell command line. Usage
is quite similar, however, as you can see in this quick example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ printf "&gt; %d &lt;\n" 42
&gt; 42 &lt;

</pre>
</p><p>
In this case, the format string (argument #1) details the desired output,
with <tt  >%d</tt> indicating that a decimal value will be printed, then argument
2 is that value, 42.
</p><p>
Where this gets interesting is because you actually can use other values
in the format string to force octal or hexadecimal:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ printf "octal: %o\nhex: %x\n" 42 42 
octal: 52
hex: 2a
</pre>
</p><p>
Because of the notational convention mentioned earlier for non-decimal
numbers in the shell, you also can specify an octal or hexadecimal
value too:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ printf "%o\n" 0500
500
</pre>
</p><p>
Wait, what happened in that last example? It's simple: I specified that
I wanted octal (base-8) output, but by using the leading zero, I also
indicated that I was specifying a value in octal too. Ergo, 0500 = 500.
</p><p>
That's nice, but no binary, which is a definite limitation.
</p><p>
But, I'm not done yet. There's one more way you can convert values,
and it's actually directly within the shell. It turns out that using the
<tt  >$(( ))</tt> notation, you actually can specify a numeric
base for numbers!
</p><p>
This is something I stumbled across recently, having had no idea that
this was even a capability of the shell, but check this out, a quick
conversion of 33 base-16 to decimal:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo $((16#33))
51
</pre>
</p><p>
Not only that, but the leading zero and leading &ldquo;0x&rdquo; are both
valid too:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo $(( 0xFF ))
255
</pre>
</p><p>
If you don't care about binary values, you can see that there are three
completely different ways to convert numeric bases from within a shell
script. Now take what I've shown here and do something really slick!
</p><p>
In a future article, I'll explore some other shortcuts for conditional statements
that let you skip the mundane &ldquo;if condition ; then XX else XX
fi&rdquo; notational
sequence.
