The PostgreSQL Global Development Group's PostgreSQL</h2></div></div><p>
With Gartner predicting that 70% of new applications soon will be deployed
on an open-source relational database, purveyors of proprietary DBMSes
surely long for the golden lock-in age of yore. Said trend is in no small
part due to the surging PostgreSQL, which recently stepped up to a new version
9.5. Highlights of this release, reported the PostgreSQL Global Development
Group, include the addition of UPSERT capability, Row Level Security and
multiple Big Data features, all of which the Group hopes will broaden the
user base for the database. The Group added that version 9.5 marks a
turning point for use of Postgres with data-driven applications of
engagement and high-speed, high-volume mobile, Web and digital apps. Other
specific features are performance boosters for today's more powerful
&ldquo;big iron&rdquo; servers, analytics and productivity enhancements to
speed complex query capabilities on extreme data volumes, and a foundation
for horizontal scalability across multiple servers for importing entire
tables from external databases.

Bruce Douglass' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Agile Systems Engineering</em></span> (Morgan Kaufmann)</h2></div></div><p>
System engineers in aerospace, defense, automotive, transportation and
rail, not to mention embedded software developers across disciplines, will
be drawn to the ideas in Dr Bruce Douglass' new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Agile Systems
Engineering</em></span>. In the book, world-renowned author and speaker Douglass
presents a vision of systems engineering in which precise specification of
requirements, structure and behavior fuse with larger concerns, such as
safety, security, reliability and performance in an agile engineering
context. Douglass incorporates agile methods and model-based systems
engineering (MBSE) to define the properties of entire systems while
avoiding errors that can occur when using traditional textual
specifications. The lifecycle of systems development is covered, including
requirements, analysis, design and the handoff to specific engineering
disciplines. The goal is to arm systems engineers with the conceptual and
methodological tools they need to avoid specification defects and improve
system quality while simultaneously reducing the effort and cost of systems
engineering.

SUSE Linux Enterprise</h2></div></div><p>
In order to bridge the traditional enterprise Linux business with the
emerging workloads of the cloud era, the new SUSE Linux Enterprise Service
Pack 1 (SP1) adopts a modular approach. This means that parts of the OS run
a faster lifecycle than the base OS, yet receive full support. It also
means accelerated innovation through support for all recent hardware from
IBM and Intel, including Intel Xeon and IBM z13, with SUSE claiming
exclusive Linux-distribution support for the latter. In addition, SP1
provides new modules to apply updates for Linux container features or
security requirements without having to update and recertify the base
operating system. Meanwhile, Package Hub enables the latest technologies
developed by the Open Source community to be compiled by SUSE for use with
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. Rounding out the SP1 innovations are new
capabilities for maintaining application uptime, an improvement in the
efficiency of data-center development and operations and Docker support,
among others.

Craig Smith's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Car Hacker's Handbook</em></span> (No Starch Press)</h2></div></div><p>
Not long ago, a group of benevolent hackers, from a couch ten miles away, no
less, took full control of a friend's Jeep and ran it into a ditch. We
should all take pause as automakers rush to transform cars into smartphones
on wheels and a Wild West frontier emerges in automotive security.
Security-minded people seeking to explore this frontier now have a
cowboy-in-chief, Craig Smith, a security expert who has advised automakers
and written a new book called <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Car Hacker's
Handbook</em></span>. The book is a
guide that shows how to identify network security risks, exploit software
vulnerabilities and gain a deeper understanding of the software running in
our vehicles. Along the way, Smith teachers readers how navigation systems
can be hacked to take control of vehicles, how systems are interconnected,
and even how to bypass dealership restrictions to diagnose and troubleshoot
problems. Not only is this book a technical manual for hackers, but it's also
a wake-up call for legislators and car manufacturers.

The Linux Foundation's Automotive Grade Linux</h2></div></div><p>
You couldn't ask for a better segue than this, from Smith's book
about the pitfalls of automotive security to our community's solution
to them&mdash;that is, The Linux Foundation's Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) new
Unified Code Base (UCB) distribution. AGL is a Linux Foundation Workgroup
dedicated to creating open-source software solutions for automotive
applications. AGL's UCB distribution is a collaborative open-source
project developing a common, Linux-based software stack for the connected
car. Leveraging the best software components from AGL and other existing
open-source projects, such as Tizen and GENIVI Alliance, UCB enables
development of in-vehicle-infotainment systems while allowing different
profiles to be created from the same code base to address all applications
in the car, such as instrument cluster, heads-up display, telematics and
connected car. UCB is based on the Yocto Project and offers a complete
embedded-Linux development environment with tools, metadata and
documentation. AGL's members make up a &ldquo;who's who&rdquo; of the
automotive, IT and electronics industries, including Toyota, Ford, Intel,
Sony, Linaro, Wind River and scores of others.

Samsung's SmartThings</h2></div></div><p>
If you pick up a Samsung Smart TV this year, you'll be certain to find
&ldquo;Linux Inside&rdquo; in many ways. Samsung continues to build on its
Tizen-powered Smart TV UI, which this year it will enhance with integrated
SmartThings IoT hub technology, enabling the TV as the control center for a
smart home. Samsung's SUHD TVs for 2016 will enable users to connect
with, control and monitor hundreds of other compatible devices including
lights, locks, thermostats, cameras, speakers, appliances, sensors and the
like. This world of devices is enabled via the SmartThings Extend USB
adapter, which plugs directly in to the TV, enabling the monitoring and
controlling of ZigBee and Z-Wave devices. The SmartThings SUHD application
will allow users to trigger SmartThings Routines, receive notifications and
observe what's happening in and around the home with compatible cameras
and control connected devices. This integration of the SmartThings
functionality eliminates the need to obtain Samsung's existing
SmartThings Home Monitoring Kit.

Makeblock's mBot</h2></div></div><p>
The new kid-friendly mBot from Makeblock is marketed as a Science,
Technology and Mathematics (STEM) educational learning tool. The product is
a full, all-in-one solution for kids&mdash;of all ages, of course&mdash;to enjoy
the hands-on experience of programming, electronics and robotics. Working
with a graphical programming interface called mBlock, which is inspired by
Scratch 2.0, kids can learn programming, control the robot and realize
multiple functions. Users can program the robot to light up, send it
messages and move it around using open-source ecosystems like Raspberry Pi or
Arduino. mBot can connect to a mobile device via Bluetooth so that users
can control movements with an app. The 38 parts can be assembled in around
ten minutes, and color-labeled RJ25 ports ensure that wiring is
convenient and maximum time can be spent on programming and creativity.
Extensibility is infinite thanks to compatibility with the broader
Makeblock platform as well as most LEGO bricks. Finally, two manuals and
courses, both on-line and developed and maintained by teachers, enable
maximum utilization of mBot for STEM education.

Zappix Visual IVR</h2></div></div><p>
Zappix's development of its Visual IVR customer service platform is
informed by research showing that 77% of consumers report that valuing
their time is the most important element of good service. Zappix is a
highly intuitive self-help Visual IVR software suite platform for Android,
iPhone, tablets and mobile Web that integrates voice and non-voice visual
content with customer service channels&mdash;for example, phone/voice, Web, mobile
on-line forms and multimedia resources. An updated version of the platform
now supports voice-enabled commands for integrating with the visual IVR
prompts. The new voice capability, reports Zappix, enables a better and
smoother Visual IVR experience. Users now can search for problems,
solutions and even their channel of choice using speech and receive visual
prompts on their smartphone. The new functionality is intended to empower
companies to provide the best of both formats&mdash;that is, visual and voice
commands&mdash;allowing organizations to process high call volumes
effectively and reduce the frustration callers experience searching for an item in
complex IVR systems.
