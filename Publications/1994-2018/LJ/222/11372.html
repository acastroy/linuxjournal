Whether you want to install a custom theme or just get rid
of apps installed by your carrier, rooting an Android phone puts you
in charge.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2530580.0x2628358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I've owned two different Android phones since they first were released,
and I eventually rooted both of them. My Droid (original) was such a
popular phone that rooting it was very simple. I used my rooted Droid
until it wore out and rebooted every time I slid open the keyboard. My
second Android phone, the Samsung Galaxy S2, is the phone I have right
now. It actually was quite a bit more challenging to root, but in the
end, I couldn't resist the lure of total control. Sadly, no amount of
rooting can supply a hardware keyboard for my S2, but at least I can
run whatever ROM I want on it now. Before I go into how to root an
Android device, it's important to discuss why you might want to do so,
or why you might not.
</p><p>
One of the most common questions I get via e-mail or Twitter is how
to root an Android phone. As you can see by the size of the following
article, that's not a question easily answered in 140 characters. So, in
this article, I talk about rooting an Android device and then describe the
process for installing a custom ROM. It's complex, sometimes frustrating,
and it can be dangerous if you don't do your homework in advance. If that
doesn't scare you off, read on.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2530580.0x2628568"></a>
What Is Rooting?</h2></div></div><p>
Rooting your phone simply means gaining access to the underlying Linux
(Android) operating system with root privileges. It's basically the
same thing as having sudo access to a Linux desktop. By default, your
phone will give you only user-level privileges, which means you can't
run programs requiring superuser access to the underlying system.
</p><p>
There is some confusion regarding what rooting actually gives you. If you
root your phone, you'll still be running the same firmware. Your phone
won't look any different, apart from a new app called
&ldquo;superuser&rdquo;, which
will allow you to give certain applications elevated privileges. From
a functionality standpoint, rooting your phone gives you the ability to
run applications that wouldn't otherwise work, but it won't completely
transform your phone like a custom ROM would do (more on that in a bit).
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Rooting Your Phone, the Pros:</b></span>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Some useful apps, like backup apps, will work only with root access.
</p></li><li><p>
Some apps, like Tasker, work with unrooted phones, but they do much more if your
phone is rooted.
</p></li><li><p>
Rooting is the first step toward installing new ROMs.
</p></li><li><p>
Overclocking and underclocking are possible only with root access.
</p></li><li><p>
Having a rooted phone implies some geek street cred.
</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Rooting Your Phone, the Cons:</b></span>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Rooting most likely will void your warranty.
</p></li><li><p>
Some apps (Amazon video streaming, for example) will not work on a rooted
phone.
</p></li><li><p>
Rooting is the first step toward potentially bricking your device.
</p></li><li><p>
Using some root-requiring apps (Wi-Fi tethering, for example) may cause fees
from your wireless carrier.

I Want Root!!!</h2></div></div><p>
Unlike Apple's iPhone, the Android world is full of multiple vendors,
multiple devices and multiple procedures for rooting. Heck, even my
Samsung Galaxy S2 comes in different models for different carriers, all
with slightly different ways to do things. There just isn't a single
&ldquo;way&rdquo; to root an Android device. To add more frustration to the mix,
the methods and even the feasibility of rooting often depend not only on
the hardware, but also on the specific version of the Android OS installed on
the hardware. For example, I upgraded my Galaxy S2 to the official AT&amp;T
version of Ice Cream Sandwich. For quite a while after that official
upgrade was released, rooting wasn't possible for folks who upgraded
using official channels. This means that before attempting
to root your phone, it's important to research your exact model phone
and the exact version of Android you're currently running.
</p><p>
Luckily for Android users, there is a large and active community of users
for almost every device available. A quick trip to <a href="http://androidforums.com" target="_self">androidforums.com</a>
usually will turn up a thread dedicated to rooting a particular phone
or tablet. Be careful with generic Google searches, because it seems
there are unending blog posts and forum entries claiming to have the
newest and best rooting methods. Unfortunately, those well-meaning blog
posts aren't always updated when a less-dangerous or more-reliable
method is developed. Sticking to sites like <a href="http://androidforums.com" target="_self">androidforums.com</a> or
<a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com" target="_self">forum.xda-developers.com</a> is a good way to keep up on the latest
developments with regard to the world of hacking and rooting.

But My Phone Looks the Same!</h2></div></div><p>
The superuser app is all well and good, but apart from opening up the
possibility for root-requiring apps, rooting a phone doesn't change the
way it looks. For that, you need a new ROM. Unfortunately, installing a
custom ROM is a complex endeavor for some devices, and not all devices
even support custom ROMs. What is a ROM, you ask? Basically, in the Android
world, the terms &ldquo;ROM&rdquo; and &ldquo;firmware&rdquo; often are interchangeable. The
actual Linux operating system with all its applications and sometimes
kernel usually are packaged together in a downloadable ROM file for a
particular phone or tablet. One of my favorite custom ROMs is the
open-source CyanogenMod (Figure 1). Because hardware
is so different across devices, it's important to get a ROM file
specifically created for your exact model. This is one instance where
buying a particularly popular phone is a boon, because those devices
usually are supported first.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11372f1.large.jpg"><img src="11372f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Even the boot screen of CyanogenMod is cool.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2530580.0x2629640"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Major Warning:</b></p><p>
Rooting
your phone will void your warranty and possibly cause other unforeseen
problems. Once you go down the path of custom ROMs, like I discuss here,
the likelihood of a bricked phone increases. A truly ruined
phone or tablet is pretty uncommon anymore, but it's easy to get your
device into a completely unusable state that takes hours and hours to
try to undo. I'm a pretty tech-savvy guy, but getting CyanogenMod on
my Galaxy S2 took several hours, and there were several times when I did
something wrong and my phone was temporarily &ldquo;bricked&rdquo;. Before you try
to flash a custom ROM, make sure you understand the process! 
</p></div><p>
Once your phone is rooted, you need to make sure you have a recovery
system that supports custom, unsigned ROMs. The system recovery is a
part of the Android device that acts a little like the system BIOS of a
computer system. Most times, when you root a phone, a custom recovery
program is flashed too. That isn't always the case, however, so it's
important to make sure you have a recovery program flashed onto your
system that supports custom ROMs. The most popular recovery program
by far is ClockworkMod, available at <a href="http://www.clockworkmod.com" target="_self">www.clockworkmod.com</a>. It can be
very challenging to flash ClockworkMod onto your rooted phone by hand,
so I highly recommend the program Rom Manager from the Google Play
store. The free version of Rom Manager includes the ability to flash
a custom recovery program, so unless you run into problems using Rom
Manager, it's hard to find a reason to use any other method. If you want
a one-stop method for installing complete ROMs, the paid version of Rom
Manager can make that process painless too. If you don't want to shell
out the dough, however, using ClockworkMod to install ROMs is dead simple.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2530580.0x26299b0"></a>
Before You Begin</h2></div></div><p>
You've read the warnings, but you've seen CyanogenMod in action, and
you really think a custom ROM is for you. Before I talk about flashing,
let's quickly look at the pros and cons.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Custom ROM&mdash;the Pros:</b></span>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Most custom ROMs are compiled for specific devices and often are optimized
for better battery life or faster performance.
</p></li><li><p>
Custom ROMs eliminate all the pre-installed applications your carrier
forces you to keep on your device.
</p></li><li><p>
If you want to tweak the look of your phone, most ROMs support elaborate
customizations.
</p></li><li><p>
If a rooted phone gets you geek cred, a custom ROM makes you a guru.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Custom ROM&mdash;the Cons:</b></span>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Installing a custom ROM almost always is tricky.
</p></li><li><p>
If you're not comfortable with troubleshooting, installing software on your
computer or pulling out some hair, custom firmware may not be for you.
</p></li><li><p>
Although it's rare nowadays, it's still possible to brick your phone.
</p></li><li><p>
You almost assuredly will lose your carrier's support if something goes
wrong; carriers won't help and will have no pity.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2530580.0x2a22498"></a>
Cross Your Is and Dot Your Ts</h2></div></div><p>
If you still want to install custom firmware, go to the Web site to get the
ROM. Again, I really like CyanogenMod (<a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com" target="_self">www.cyanogenmod.com</a>). Once you
locate the specific ROM file for your exact device (remember, even the
Samsung Galaxy S2 has several different models, all needing different
ROMs), put the zip file on the root of your SD card. Then, make sure
it's the correct ROM. Yes, I realize I keep saying that, but fixing a
phone that won't boot due to flashing an incompatible ROM can be very
frustrating. Anyway, once you have the zipped ROM on your SD card, boot
the device into recovery mode. Most phones have a certain method for
booting into recovery mode, usually consisting of holding down certain
buttons while booting. But, because you already have Rom Manager installed,
simply choose &ldquo;reboot into recovery&rdquo; from the menu (Figure 2), and
your phone or tablet should reboot directly into ClockworkMod.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11372f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Rom Manager is a great tool, and one of the few apps I buy
without hesitation.
</p></div></div><p>
Once ClockworkMod is loaded, navigate the menus using some combinations
of buttons on your phone. Often volume up/down will traverse the menus,
and the home button will select. Depending on your device and the
version of ClockworkMod, you may have other buttons or the touchscreen
with which to navigate. Before you flash your new ROM, you need to make a
backup! Thankfully, ClockworkMod has the backup feature built in, and
in the event of a failure, as long as you can reboot into recovery mode,
you should be able to restore your phone to the backup.
</p><p>
Now that you have a backup (you do have a backup, right?), navigate the
ClockworkMod menu to find the &ldquo;install zip from sdcard&rdquo; option, and
locate the ROM file you saved onto your SD card. You'll get the option
of whether to wipe the data directory, and often with brand-new
ROMs, it's a good idea to get a fresh start.
</p><p>
After your Android device is flashed, it will reboot and, hopefully, load
the custom ROM you flashed from your SD card. If something goes wrong,
you'll need to go back to the forums and try to find someone who 
had a similar problem or even post a question yourself. (I urge you
to search long and hard before posting though. I've never had a problem
that was unique to my setup, and it seems someone always has made a similar
mistake and posted about it.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2530580.0x2a22968"></a>
Success!</h2></div></div><p>
If everything went well, you now should have a pretty great Android system
without all the bundled apps your carrier originally installed. You've
also made it so that if you go to your carrier for support, the customer
service rep will
laugh at you and possibly accuse you of doing horribly nefarious things
by installing a custom ROM. The advantages outweigh the disadvantages
for many folks, so if you have a few spare hours and a willingness to
put your beloved Android device at risk, rooting and installing custom
firmware can be a great way to breathe new life into a tired phone.
</p><p>
In closing, although most devices available require the bootloader
to be unlocked (that is, rooted) in order to gain access to the underlying
system, there are a few limited exceptions. If you want an Android tablet
with root access out of the box, and a vendor who thinks custom ROMs are
a great idea, check out the review of ZaReason's ZaTab in the September 2012 issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>. ZaReason doesn't try to lock you out of your own device,
and that deserves praise (<a href="http://www.zareason.com" target="_self">www.zareason.com</a>).
