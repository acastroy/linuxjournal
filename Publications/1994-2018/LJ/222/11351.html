<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #222, October 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Some <span   class="bold"><b>futex benchmarking code</b></span> seems to be making its way into the
official Linux tree. <span   class="bold"><b>Hitoshi Mitake</b></span> started porting over some of
<span   class="bold"><b>Darren Hart</b></span>'s and <span   class="bold"><b>Michel Lespinasse</b></span>'s out-of-kernel benchmarking
suite and turning it into a new perf subsystem for futexes.
</p><p>
Futexes are simple locking mechanisms that allow the kernel to divvy
up resources among all the users on a given system, without each
user's actions conflicting with any of the others. There are a lot of
simple and complicated locking mechanisms in the kernel, and futexes
are used in the design of many of them. Without them, the kernel would
have a tough time being multitasking.
</p><p>
Darren had no major objections to Hitoshi's work, and Hitoshi
suggested migrating even more of Darren's futex test code into perf's
tools/ directory, because it offered good examples of how to use
futexes, in addition to being useful test code in general. Everyone
seemed favorable, so it looks like this will happen.
</p><p>
It can be difficult to navigate the vicissitudes of feature
requirements. Sometimes a seemingly inexplicable aspect of a feature
can turn out to be needed by one particular corner case of users.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>John Stultz</b></span> recently tried to improve the way the kernel handled
<span   class="bold"><b>anonymous memory</b></span> on swapless systems. He'd noticed that anonymous RAM
was tracked on two lists: an active page list and an inactive page
list. Inactive pages typically would be swapped to disk if they went
unused too long. But on swapless systems, inactive pages would
just sit on the inactive list, making that list seem irrelevant. John
proposed that on swapless systems, it made more sense to have just a
single list.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Minchan Kim</b></span> pointed out that he too had tried introducing a similar
refinement, but that <span   class="bold"><b>Rik van Riel</b></span> had vetoed his patch. The reason Rik
gave was that swapless systems were not always entirely
swapless&mdash;sometimes they were systems where swap had been only temporarily
disabled, or systems where there really was not going to be any swap,
but people still could enable it if they wished. In that case, the
absence of an inactive page list would make it harder to use the newly
available swap space.
</p><p>
Back in June, the world gained a &ldquo;leap second&rdquo;, and <span   class="bold"><b>Richard Cochran</b></span>
wrote up some code in preparation for it that he hoped would be less
messy than the current way such things were handled in the kernel. The
problem, apparently, is that <span   class="bold"><b>POSIX UTC</b></span> was designed as a standard back
in the before-time, when computer clocks were highly inaccurate, and
no one could clearly anticipate why any such issues would matter in
the future.
</p><p>
But, to be POSIX-compliant, Linux still has to support POSIX UTC.
Richard's answer to this was interesting. Instead of actually
implementing POSIX UTC as the true &ldquo;Way of the Kernel&rdquo;, he implemented
a better system that could track things like leap seconds and other
oddities. And then, for the benefit of any user threads that wanted
POSIX semantics, Richard's code would translate the inner timekeeping
mechanism into UTC for that process.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy&mdash;Smart Audiobook Player</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #222, October 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The Audible app for Android is a great way to consume audiobooks. You have
access to all the books you've purchased on Audible, and you can download
them at will. Plus, the app provides all the bookmarking features you'd expect from
a professional application. Unfortunately, if your audiobooks are from
somewhere other than Audible, you need something a little more flexible.

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11351androidf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
For non-DRM audiobooks, there are a few stand-out apps. Mort Player and
Audiobook Player 2 are the standbys I've been using for a couple
years, but the newer Smart Audiobook Player is truly an amazing piece
of software. Although it boasts the same features you'd expect from any
audiobook player, Smart Audiobook Player also includes:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Support for almost every audio format, including .m4b (the format iPods
use).
</p></li><li><p>
Built-in cover art searching and downloading.
</p></li><li><p>
Lock screen feature to avoid accidental chapter skipping.
</p></li><li><p>
Playback speed adjustment.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Audiobooks are organized by putting each book, whether it is a single
large file or many small files, into its own folder. Smart Audiobook
Player treats each folder as a separate book and sorts the files inside
each folder by filename. In order to keep audiobook files from appearing
in your music collection, a simple .nomedia file can be added to your
root audiobook folder.
</p><p>
Although the features all work together to make an incredible audiobook
player, by far my favorite feature is the speed control. By setting
playback speed to 1.2x, the voices are still quite comprehensible, and
you can cram more book into each morning commute. Smart Audiobook Player
is free, but for a $2 in-app purchase, you can unlock the
&ldquo;Full&rdquo; features permanently, allowing for bookmarking of several books simultaneously,
and a few other nifty features. If you listen to audiobooks, but don't
purchase them all directly from Audible, you owe it to yourself to
try Smart Audiobook Player: <a href="http://is.gd/smartaudiobook" target="_self">is.gd/smartaudiobook</a>.

Every time my paycheck is direct-deposited, I contemplate purchasing a
Chromebook. Long gone are the days of the CR-48 laptops with the clunky
interface and frustrating usability. Although I never quite seem to pull
the trigger and buy a Chromebook, thanks to the developer Hexxeh,
it's possible to run the Chromium OS on a wide variety of hardware
combinations. I'm writing this on my Dell Latitude D420 booted into
Hexxeh's Vanilla build of Chromium. (I'm using the excellent Chrome App
Writebox as an editor.) You can get the most recent build of Vanilla
from Hexxeh's Web site: <a href="http://chromeos.hexxeh.net" target="_self">chromeos.hexxeh.net</a>.

</p></div></div><p>
The exciting news, however, has nothing to do with laptops at all. Like
most Linux-based pseudo-embedded projects, Hexxeh's Chromium build is
getting ported to the Raspberry Pi. Once complete, a Chromium-enabled
Raspberry Pi desktop machine will be a very affordable, power-sipping
alternative to Google's ChromeBox units. Projects like this really beg
the question: is there anything the Raspberry Pi <span   class="emphasis"><em>can't</em></span> do? For more
details on the Pi port, visit Hexxeh's blog: <a href="http://hexxeh.net" target="_self">hexxeh.net</a>.

</p></div></div><p>
The DarkWave Studio installer includes both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions
of the program. Once installed, you can create electronic music, mix
existing sounds and do post-production editing as well. A shining
example of open-source programming, DarkWave Studio has a modular
design allowing for third-party instruments and plugins while keeping its
source code completely open. Check out DarkWave Studio at

<h2 class="title">Feynman Figures for Fun</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #222, October 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In quantum physics, one of the calculations you might want to do is figure out
how two or more particles may interact. This can become rather complicated
and confusing once you get to more than two particles interacting, however. Also,
depending on the interaction, there may be the creation and annihilation
of virtual particles as part of the interaction. How can you keep all
of this straight and figure out what could be happening? Enter the
Feynman diagram (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram</a>). American physicist Richard Feynman developed Feynman
diagrams in 1948. They represent complex quantum particle interactions
through a set of very simple diagrams, made up of straight lines, wavy
lines and curly lines. This works really well if you happen to be using
a chalk board or white board. But, these media are not very useful when
sharing your ideas across the Internet. Additionally, most
word-processing software is unable to draw these diagrams for your
articles, papers and documents. So what can you do? Use the JaxoDraw software
package (<a href="http://jaxodraw.sourceforge.net" target="_self">jaxodraw.sourceforge.net</a>). 
</p><p>
JaxoDraw provides a graphical environment for drawing Feynman diagrams
on your computer. JaxoDraw is a Java application, so it should run
on any OS that has a reasonably recent Java virtual machine. There
currently are packages only for Fedora and Gentoo, but both
source and binary downloads are available. The binary download is a jar
file containing everything you need. There also are installers for
Windows and a disk image for Mac OS X users. You also
can download the source files and compile JaxoDraw for yourself
or make alterations to the sources to add extra functionality. 
JaxoDraw
supports a plugin architecture, with documentation on how to create your
own. This might be a more effective way of adding any extra functionality
you need.
</p><p>
Let's use the most flexible setup for JaxoDraw. This involves downloading
a tarball from the main Web site, in the Downloads section. The filename you should see is jaxodraw-x.x-x-bin.tar.gz. Once this file is
downloaded, you can unpack it with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar xvzf jaxodraw-x.x-x-bin.tar.gz
</pre>
</p><p>
This will create a subdirectory containing the jar file and some
documentation files. To start up JaxoDraw, first change to the new
subdirectory and run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
java -jar jaxodraw-x.x-x.jar
</pre>
</p><p>
Be aware that currently the GNU Java virtual machine doesn't run
JaxoDraw. On start up, you will have an empty canvas and a list of the
elements available to draw your Feynman diagram (Figure 1). The left-hand
side is broken into several sections, including the types of particles
or the types of edits available. JaxoDraw uses XML files to save Feynman
diagrams. This way, you can load them again later to make edits or build
up more-complicated reactions.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11351jaxf1.large.jpg"><img src="11351jaxf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. JaxoDraw on Startup
</p></div></div><p>
To begin drawing, first select an object type from the left-hand
side. The regular particle types are fermions (straight lines), scalars
(dashed lines), ghost (dotted lines), photons (wiggly lines) and gluons
(pig-tailed lines). In the diagrams, there are four versions of these
particle lines: lines, arcs, loops and beziers. Once you select one of
those, you can draw on the canvas by clicking and dragging to draw the
relevant line. You can draw anywhere on the canvas, or you can force
the drawing to snap to grid points. The spacing of these grid points
is adjustable in the Preferences. At least in the beginning, you 
probably will want to turn this on so that you can make the different sections
of your drawing line up. Each of the elements of your drawing has
properties that can be edited. You need to select the edit tool from the
left-hand side, and then select the element you want to edit (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11351jaxf2.large.jpg"><img src="11351jaxf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Edit Options
</p></div></div><p>
From here, you can edit the location, whether there is an arrow and which
direction it points, the line width and arrow dimensions. There is also a
text element you can use to label your diagram. You can enter text in
either LaTeX format or PostScript format. This allows you to use special
characters, such Greek letters, in your text label. One thing to remember
is that you can't mix PostScript and LaTeX text objects. Be sure to select
the text type based on what you want to produce for exported output. 
</p><p>
You can group a number of diagram elements together in a single entity. You need
to press the selection tool on the left-hand side and then click on each
of the entities for the group you are creating. This grouped entity 
then can be moved as a single object. You can group together these groups
into super groups. There is no technical limit to this type of nesting.
</p><p>
You can get a rough idea of what your Feynman diagram will look like, but
things like LaTeX text aren't rendered on the drawing canvas. You
need to pass it through a rendering program and then view the output. You
will need to go to Options&rarr;Preferences and set the paths for the
helper programs. To get a preview of your finished diagram,
be sure to set the preferred PostScript viewer, the LaTeX path and the
dvips path. 
A common PostScript viewer is gv, the viewer that comes with
ghostscript. 
</p><p>
Once you have finished your diagram, save it
as a JaxoDraw XML file. This way, you always can go back and re-create the
diagram if needed. 
</p><p>
You can export your Feynman diagram in one of several
formats. You can export into image files (JPEG and PNG). This is useful
if you are using PowerPoint or Web pages or some other software package
that doesn't understand LaTeX or PostScript. You also have the option to
export into LaTeX or PostScript file formats. If you export to LaTeX, you
need to include the JaxoDraw LaTeX style file to handle the rendering
of your Feynman diagram. This style file is called axodraw4j.sty,
which is based on J. Vermaseren's original axodraw.sty
(<a href="http://www.nikhef.nl/~form/maindir/others/axodraw/axodraw.html" target="_self">www.nikhef.nl/~form/maindir/others/axodraw/axodraw.html</a>). This is now a
separate download from the main JaxoDraw application download. You will
want to install this where your LaTeX installation can find it and use
it. The easiest thing to do is copy it into the same directory as
your LaTeX document source files. LaTeX searches there by default when
you render your LaTeX documents. axodraw4j.sty is still in beta, so
you may want to stick with the original axodraw package. This package
also is needed if you want to preview your diagram in JaxoDraw.
</p><p>
Now that I've covered some of JaxoDraw's features, let's
look at drawing one of the classic particle interactions. This is where an
electron and a positron collide, producing photons. The first step is to
draw two fermions, with arrows pointing in opposite directions (Figure 3).
In these diagrams, space is in the vertical direction, and time is in the
horizontal direction. Time increases from left to right. The electron and
positron collide and annihilate, producing at least one photon (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11351jaxf3.large.jpg"><img src="11351jaxf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Electron/Positron Collision

Figure 4. Producing a Photon
</p></div></div><p>
At the time of this writing, four plugins are available. These
are different export functions. Two of them are for exporting to PDF or
SVG file formats. The third one is to serialize your diagram in the Java
binary file serialization format. This format should be functionally
equivalent to the XML file format, but it is smaller and loads faster,
especially for larger diagrams. The only problem with it is that it
is a binary file format, so you can't take a look inside it. The last
plugin is just a text exporter. It provides a template to show you what
a simple custom exporter looks like. 
</p><p>
JaxoDraw has a plugin manager to
handle installing and uninstalling plugins (Figure 5). You simply have to download
the relevant jar file, then use the plugin manager to install it. Plugins
are stored at $HOME/.jaxodraw/$VERSION/plugins. If you like, you can
install plugins manually by dropping the associated jar file into this
directory. To uninstall manually, you can delete the relevant jar file
and any corresponding property files from this location.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11351jaxf5.large.jpg"><img src="11351jaxf5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Plugin Manager
</p></div></div><p>
With the possible sighting of the Higgs boson at the LHC, interest in
particle physics is growing. Now, with JaxoDraw, you too can write
about particle interactions and be able to draw a proper picture to
show others what you are trying to describe. Have fun, and share your
insights with others.

<h2 class="title">Kernel Poll</h2>
<div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
We recently asked our LinuxJournal.com readers to answer a poll about
all things Linux kernel, and we present the answers below. Although it's
clear that we have readers with widely varying experiences, a few 
answers stand out. We're happy to learn that most of you have read the
GNU GPL v.2, and that a full 40% of you have helped a friend compile the
kernel for the first time. We're not at all surprised to learn that 68%
of you have read the kernel source code just for fun, and that 27% have
grepped for naughty words. We do, however, wonder how the 17% of you
who have never sacrificed sleep to keep coding have managed it. We'll
just assume programming isn't your thing in order to feel better about
our own time management skills. And finally, I would love to know more

It's getting harder and harder to differentiate between schizophrenics

<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Katherine Druckman</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #222, October 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
This month, all subscribers will receive a bonus issue in addition to
their regular October 2012 issue
of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>. This <span   class="emphasis"><em>Drupal Special
Edition</em></span> focuses on Drupal's
versatility as a CMS, a platform and as a base on which to develop
products and distributions. This special issue features articles with
technical takeaways for all levels of Drupal users and developers. So,
whether you're a seasoned developer or just curious about Drupal
and its capabilities, I encourage you to dive in.

</p><p>
In this special issue, you'll learn more about Drupal's hook system,
the Drupal community, how to create a re-usable installation profile,
how a distribution aimed at higher education scrapes and imports large
amounts of data, continuous integration options, customizing the
popular Open Atrium distribution, and much more.
</p><p>
Subscribers will receive a notification when the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Drupal Special
Edition</em></span>
is ready for download, or you can find out how to get a copy at
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/special/drupal2012" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/special/drupal2012</a>.

<h2 class="title">Writebox</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #222, October 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I've reviewed plenty of simple text editors designed for writers. For my
writing, I really desire only a few features:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Support for plain text.
</p></li><li><p>
Spell Czech.
</p></li><li><p>
Running word count.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Oddly enough, the last item is the most difficult to find. In fact, most
text editors don't have a running word count, even though that's the metric
most writing is measured by. In fact, the editor I'm using right now, from
<a href="http://is.gd/writebox" target="_self">is.gd/writebox</a>, didn't have that simple feature when I first started
using it. I e-mailed the developer, and within hours, the feature was added
to the application!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11351writef1.large.jpg"><img src="11351writef1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
If you followed the link, you'll notice Writebox is a Chrome application
that runs completely inside your browser. Because it's a Web application,
when the running word-count feature was added, it instantly was available
to all users. If a text-only editor with Dropbox syncing, off-line support
and a running word count sounds like the text editor of your dreams, check
out Writebox.
