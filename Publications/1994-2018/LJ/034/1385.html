    Phil Hughes and Gary Moore attend the trade shows DECUS and Open
    Systems World/FedUNIX and bring back some notes from the front.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2216580.0x230e3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>On November 11 through 13, Carlie
Fairchild and I attended the DECUS show in Anaheim, California.
While DECUS has generally been a good show for SSC, this show was
small and we were the only Linux vendor attending. The best guess
why is with UseLinux coming up in the same place in January, it was
an easy show for people&mdash;vendors as well as Linux-heads&mdash;to skip.
</p><p>There was a series of talks on Linux presented by Jon
&ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall and myself. Attendance was between 20 and 50, and I
think we managed to make some converts.</p><p>Carlie had also arranged for me to speak to the local Linux
users' group on Wednesday night. About 25 people attended
(including &ldquo;maddog&rdquo;). I presented a talk called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Looking
at Linux</em></span>. Much of this talk focused on the commercial
viability of Linux, which was an issue many of the group's members
had been attempting to address on their own. I stressed four
criteria for commercial viability: reliability, interoperability,
support and capabilities.</p><p>The talk was well received and the meeting turned into a
informal discussion of Linux in general. I look forward to talking
with these people again during the UseLinux show.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2216580.0x230e660"></a>And More for User Groups</h2></div></div><p>By the time you read this I will have presented this talk
again at The Evergreen State College for their Linux Users' Group.
I am also being interviewed on a program called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Geek
Talk</em></span> on their radio station. While I hardly consider
myself a geek, the last time I was on this station was 17 years
ago, so I guess it is about time to be a radio personality
again.</p><p>SSC's emphasis on users' groups is not new. We made LUG/nut,
an inexpensive package consisting of a Linux CD and a card good for
a sample issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, available to
users' groups over a year ago. We are now working on a way to help
new users' groups form, get publicity and attract new members.
Watch our web site for details.</p><p>&mdash;Phil Hughes, Publisher</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2216580.0x230e8c8"></a>Open Systems World/FedUNIX</h2></div></div><p>The first week of November, I went to Washington, D.C. to
attend Open Systems World/FedUNIX. While several dedicated Linux
fans came by the booth, most of the people I talked to knew very
little about Linux. Some were just cruising the booths, collecting
whatever anyone was giving away, but we don't mind&mdash;the literature
they picked up may spark some real interest later on. (One show
attendee, in addition to taking a few of whatever we had also took
the neat twirly thing we'd acquired from another exhibitor's
booth.)</p><p>Linux vendors in attendance were Yggdrasil Computing,
InfoMagic, and Red Hat Software, giving me a chance to meet Adam
Richter of Yggdrasil, Bob Young and Lisa Sullivan of Red Hat, and
Henry Pierce and Greg Deeds of InfoMagic.</p><p>Adding credence to Linux's worth in the minds of those with
no free software experience was Digital Equipment's display of a
DEC Alpha running Linux and maddog's enthusiasm for the operating
system. (By the time I got over to actually see the machine,
someone was demonstrating Quake on it. I sat down and showed him a
couple things I remembered from playing Doom&mdash;it was kind of
surreal to be sitting amidst all the professional frumpery of the
show while virtually running around swinging a very large and
lethal axe.)</p><p>Jeff Leyland of Wolfram Research, the makers of Mathematica,
spoke about Wolfram switching to Linux as their development
platform. There were other speakers I should have made time to
hear, but I got caught up talking to people coming by our booth and
asking about Linux. I knew that after a few talks, the Linux booths
would get flooded with people excited to check it out.</p><p>I also heard that Ernst &amp; Young&mdash;well-known for their
accounting services among other things&mdash;apparently use Red Hat
Linux in-house and have asked IBM, with whom they contract for
computer services, to support their Linux machines. (If you're from
Ernst &amp; Young, please send me some mail. We'd like to hear
about how you're using Linux.)</p><p>Adam Richter predicted a new version of Yggdrasil's
Plug-and-Play Linux in the first quarter of '97. At OSW they had
pressings of their new 8-CD Internet Archives set, which includes
several distributions, including a couple I hadn't heard of
before.</p><p>I would have felt cut off from the world (yes, even in D.C.
on election night) if it hadn't been for David Lescher, who set me
up with dial-in PPP access for my laptop; and David Niemi, who made
some necessary tweaks to my chat script. I'm also grateful to Mark
Komarinski, who put together a Linux talk on very short notice when
I found I was dangerously close to having no time whatsoever to
prepare one myself.</p><p>The Santa Cruz Operation was there giving away copies of
their Free SCO OpenServer. Someone who'd just acquired one of those
gems asked me why she'd be interested in Linux if she had
OpenServer; I noted its limitations and handed her a copy of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, hoping to plant a seed. Some attendees were being less
subtle, affixing prominently to their big blue IBM literature boxes
the Linux bumper stickers we were giving away.</p><p>&mdash;Gary Moore, Editor</p></div></div>
