    Emacs aficionados
    will point out that Emacs is intended to be left running all
    of the time; in some ways the editor doubles as an operating
    environment or shell.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c4c580.0x1d44558"></a>Introduction</h2></div></div><p>Most Linux users have probably used the Gnu Emacs text editor
at one time or another, if only out of curiosity. Originally
intended as a programmer's editor, Emacs has grown over the years,
accreting to itself pieces of LISP code from a variety of
contributors. Now one of the most common complaints about the
editor is its sheer bulk and concomitant slowness to load. Emacs
aficionados will point out that Emacs is intended to be left
running all of the time; in some ways the editor doubles as an
operating environment or shell. As high-speed CPUs, faster hard
disks and larger amounts of RAM have become more affordable, this
complaint is no longer as much of a concern as it once was.</p><p>Emacs makes up for this minor drawback by being very
configurable and extensible. Name a function related to text and
there is probably an Emacs mode that will facilitate it. Many
people use Emacs as their sole mail and Usenet news client, while
programmers will find code-editing, compiling, and debugging well
supported for a variety of programming languages. You can
syntax-highlight any sort of text or code. The shell mode allows
input and output from your preferred shell to be the contents of a
buffer, from which text can be cut and pasted into other buffers.
The various modes such as mail, news and the programming-specific
modules are loaded and unloaded as needed.</p><p>Though many people over the years have contributed modes and
enhancements to Emacs, the program is still firmly controlled by
Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation, who wrote the
first version back in the mid-seventies.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c4c580.0x1d44710"></a>Two Editors Diverged in a Yellow Wood...</h2></div></div><p>Before Gnu Emacs became well integrated with the X Window
System there arose a group of Emacs-users, both private and
corporate, who were impatient with the pace of the progress
Stallman and the FSF were making on the program. They initiated a
project to improve the user interface of Emacs (especially the X
Window System support) with the intention of eventually merging the
two code lines together.</p><p>One of the companies involved, the now-defunct Lucid, Inc.,
gave its name to the first versions of this divergent Emacs; you
may have seen archives of Lucid Emacs files on the Linux FTP sites
or on archive CDs.</p><p>Lucid Emacs acquired a new name, Xemacs, when the Lucid
company folded. The University of Illinois, Sun Microsystems and
the Amdahl Corporation emerged as the primary institutional and
corporate supporters of the program.</p><p>Over the next few years conflicts arose between the FSF and
the Xemacs team. Richard Stallman agreed to incorporate the Xemacs
code into Gnu Emacs, but the conditions he set were unacceptable to
the Xemacs developers. A stalemate has resulted. It looks as if for
the foreseeable future the two versions of Emacs will develop in
parallel. On the one hand, this may seem like a lot of wasted
effort, but on the other, an element of competition has been
introduced which in some ways benefits the end-user.</p><p>The Free Software Foundation might have been tempted to rest
on its laurels if not for Xemacs. After all, the Gnu Emacs of even
a couple of years ago was quite a unique and respectable piece of
software. Improvements in recent years are tending towards
refinements and user-interface improvements. The basic editing
functionality really doesn't need much work.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c4c580.0x1d44978"></a>Major Differences</h2></div></div><p>Though both Gnu Emacs and Xemacs are programmed in the LISP
programming language, the underlying structures are different
enough that LISP add-on packages which work with one may not work
with the other. Luckily many of the package maintainers are
attempting to make their modules work with both Xemacs and Gnu
Emacs, though the functionality may not be identical.</p><p>As an example, Bill Perry's W3 package, which turns Emacs
into the world's only LISP-based web browser, works with both
Emacsen (an odd term which is often used as a plural form of
Emacs), but the Xemacs version will display inline images and
backgrounds whereas Gnu Emacs won't.</p><p>Xemacs features an iconic toolbar, and several modes, e.g.,
the aforementioned W3 and the VM mail mode, have their own toolbars
which only appear in Xemacs, though otherwise the modes function
well in Gnu Emacs.</p><p>Gnu Emacs is limited to fixed-width fonts, while Xemacs can
use variable-width proportional fonts. This feature will be of
little interest to programmers, as source code looks ragged and is
harder to read with proportional fonts. I confess I've never felt
the need for anything but fixed-width fonts in a text editor, but
tastes and needs differ.</p><p>I've found a few packages which work only with Gnu Emacs. One
is NC, which replaces the native Emacs directory browser, Dired,
with a Norton Commander-like interface.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c4c580.0x1d44be0"></a>Installing Xemacs</h2></div></div><p>Precompiled binaries for Linux and many other operating
systems are available from ftp://ftp.xEmacs.org and its mirrors.
Generally there is a common file which everyone needs; this
contains the platform-independent LISP files and miscellaneous
documentation, a mix of the GNU Emacs documents and Xemacs-specific
stuff. A smaller file contains the binaries for your platform. For
Linux there is a choice between statically-linked Motif
executables, dynamically-linked Motif executables (for those who
own a copy of the the Motif libraries), and dynamically-linked
Athena executables; the latter is probably the best choice if you
don't have Motif.</p><p>If you want to compile your own executables, be prepared to
make lots of disk space available. 70MB is a bare minimum
(including the unpacked source code) that will work if you
&ldquo;compile in place&rdquo;, i.e., the source-code directory will be where
you leave Xemacs. This way the new executable refers to LISP files
in the source directory. Otherwise you need another 50MB
momentarily. The structure of the Xemacs directory tree is
hard-coded into the executable; if you'd like to customise it the
Makefile has paths that can be edited.</p><p>There are various reasons for compiling your own
executable&mdash;perhaps you have no need of the icon toolbars. I've
noticed that I rarely use them now that I'm more familiar with the
equivalent keystrokes, and they do use memory you might not have to
spare. The toolbar support (as well as the pop-up menu support) can
be disabled at compile time, helping to create a leaner
executable.</p><p>Another possible change is the inclusion of a frequently used
package in the executable, rather than loading it separately from
the ~/.Emacs initialization file.</p><p>Once you've unpacked the massive Xemacs archive files you may
very well be dismayed by the amount of disk space they occupy.
Luckily you can delete quite a bit of them and still have a great
editor. If you look at the subdirectories under the LISP directory
you will find many bulky packages for which you may never have a
need, such as the Object-Oriented Browser and Hyperbole. If you
have no desire to use Xemacs as a web browser (W3 is
well-implemented but rather slow), the W3 and URL subdirectories
can go. I recommend spending some time browsing through the LISP
subdirectories; the un-byte-compiled *.el files are human-readable
and most contain informative notes which will help you decide if
you want to keep them or not. Another substantial amount of
disk-space can be reclaimed by simply gzipping all of the *.el
files; Xemacs doesn't need them at all. The reason that they are
included with Xemacs is to give users the opportunity to edit them
in order to modify their behaviour. The byte-compiled *.elc files
are what Xemacs actually uses.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c4c580.0x1d44e48"></a>Configuration</h2></div></div><p>When either version of Emacs is started the program
immediately checks your home directory for an .Emacs file. This
LISP file tells Emacs which packages you would like loaded and can
set a vast array of user choices. Xemacs comes with a sample.Emacs
file (in the /etc subdirectory) that is well commented and includes
several default functions which many have found useful. Even more
useful is the version-detection code, which determines whether you
are running Gnu Emacs or Xemacs and the version number. Separate
sections of the file are read by corresponding versions of Emacs,
allowing the use of the same .Emacs file for any version of Xemacs
or Gnu Emacs.</p><p>This permits the user to have both Xemacs and Gnu Emacs
installed and usable at the same time, allowing for comparison.
Xemacs 19.14 refines this even further, putting its configuration
in a separate file called ~/.xEmacs-options that is called from
within the ~/.Emacs file.</p><p>Though the prospect of writing LISP code in order to
introduce your own functions and modifications into your .Emacs
file may seem daunting, learning by imitating what others have done
can be effective as well. Another help is the detailed
documentation supplied with both versions in the form of
hierarchical Info files. Several skilled Emacs users have posted
their personal ~.Emacs files on web pages; a search conducted with
Lycos or Alta Vista for the keywords Emacs, Gnu Emacs, or Xemacs
will easily find such pages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c4c580.0x1d45000"></a>Advantages of Gnu Emacs</h2></div></div><p>Although at first exposure it may seem that Xemacs offers
more to users, Gnu Emacs has certain features that will tip the
scales in its favor for some people. If you have the GPM console
mouse server installed (this is included in most distributions of
Linux) Gnu Emacs interacts well with it, giving full mouse support
in console mode. Xemacs has limited mouse functionality in a
console session, but has the advantage of full face support in a
console, i.e., syntax highlighting will work in a console session,
although without as many colors as in an X session.</p><p>Gnu Emacs has a convenient editing feature: text copied or
cut from a file can be accessed from a pull-down menu on the menu
bar, with each piece of text identified by its first few words.
While there is a way to implement a similar function in Xemacs,
it's not documented in the distribution.</p><p>If memory usage is a factor for you, Gnu Emacs typically uses
about 2MB less than Xemacs, and its startup time is slightly
shorter. Of course, if you would like a lean, low-memory version of
either Emacs, you can compile without X Window System
support.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c4c580.0x1d451b8"></a>Safety</h2></div></div><p>Both versions of Emacs protect you from losing files or
unsaved text. As you type, the current buffer is periodically saved
(at user-configurable intervals) to a file called &ldquo;#filename#&rdquo;,
which can be restored in a later editing session. As soon as a file
is successfully saved, this temporary file is automatically
deleted. The normal type of backup file
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>filename~</em></span>) is also created when files are
saved. It would be difficult to lose very much text with these
safeguards in effect.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c4c580.0x1d45318"></a>Interesting Packages</h2></div></div><p>Although both Gnu Emacs and Xemacs come with HTML editing
modes, another possibility is the excellent HTML-Helper-Mode by
Nelson Minar. This mode, available from
http://www.santafe.edu/~nelson/, is quick, has good syntax
highlighting, and supports Netscape tags and tables.</p><p>Ben Wing, one of the main developers of Xemacs, has written
an elaborate SGML editing mode, which could be useful to anyone
writing in the Linuxdoc SGML format, as used by the Linux
Documentation Project. This package is included with Xemacs.</p><p>The VM mail system is included with Xemacs, and can be
obtained separately for use with Gnu Emacs. Though Rmail (the
original Emacs mail client) comes with both Emacs versions, it's
not as full-featured as VM and uses a proprietary message format,
which is a nuisance if you wish to access mail folders with other
mail programs.</p><p>And then there is William Perry's W3, an ongoing project
(consisting of a package of LISP files) which allows Emacs to
function as a web browser. In its latest incarnation W3 supports
style-sheets, inline images, background colors and bitmaps, and
even some of the Netscape tags. It's written in LISP, though, and
tends to be rather slow. With graphics turned off, running it is
like running an improved Lynx as part of Emacs. W3 is definitely
worth checking up on from time to time, as development is active
and newer versions of Xemacs are likely to be optimized for running
W3 as well. The current stable and beta versions of W3 can be
obtained from ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu in the /pub/eLISP/w3
directory.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c4c580.0x1d45528"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Either one of these two editors contains more features and
obscure functions than most of us will ever use. Xemacs is
characterised by its bells and whistles, and its developers
maintain a strong presence on the Internet. Gnu Emacs may have more
users, many of whom are also willing to help newcomers, but if you
are interested in influencing future development of either editor,
you will probably have more luck with the Xemacs team. Luckily the
basic editing commands in each version are nearly identical, so if
you learn one it doesn't take long to come up to speed in the
other.</p></div></div>
