    Here's a program that will watch your computer for those nasty
    system hang ups and reboot it as needed in your absence.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2390580.0x24884a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Starting with version 1.3.51 the Linux
kernel provides a watchdog driver. Not only does it take care of
hardware watchdogs, but it also implements a software watchdog. It
was created by Alan Cox, alan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk, and modularized
by Angelo Haritsis, ah@doc.ic.ac.uk.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2390580.0x24885b0"></a>What is a Software Watchdog?</h2></div></div><p>The Linux software watchdog is a timer that continuously
counts down from a specified start value. Once it reaches zero a
function named &ldquo;watchdog_fire&rdquo; is called that logs the event and
initiates a hard reset. A watchdog daemon is therefore needed to
refresh the timer. As long as the daemon is present the timer will
never fire, but if the daemon stops working for some reason, the
timer will fire and reboot the machine. However, with no additional
hardware, the watchdog is not able to recover from every possible
hang up. For instance, if the interrupt system itself hangs up, the
software watchdog is no cure at all.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2390580.0x24886b8"></a>What WATCHDOG Does and How It Came To Be</h2></div></div><p>At start-up, the daemon opens the watchdog device (a
character device with major number 10 and minor number 130)
starting the watchdog process&mdash;an infinite loop in which the daemon
alternately writes to the watchdog device to refresh the timer,
then sleeps for 10 seconds. If the daemon is killed, the device
file is closed, and the timer is disabled again.</p><p>Initially, I compiled the example given by Alan Cox in the
source tree to be able to start, refresh and stop the software
watchdog daemon. Since I always run the latest kernel and libc
release and rely on the machine to be up and running for e-mail,
even this simple version proved very useful for me.</p><p>As time went by, more features were added. First, WATCHDOG
became a real daemon in that it automatically forks as a background
process, tucking its process ID away. Then, since WATCHDOG is
performing a critical job, logging to the standard syslog facility
was implemented, as well as some user-friendly options:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Logging is done in verbose mode each time the
process awakes.</p></li><li><p>The sleep interval can be set from the command
line.</p></li><li><p>The file system is synchronized every time the
process updates the timer.</p></li><li><p>The watchdog device name can be chosen on the
command line.</p></li></ul></div><p>This rudimentary version was then released as a Debian
package to give more people the chance to use, and thereby, test
it. The next step was to implement some enhancements, namely the
ability to test the accessibility of a user-named file every time
the process is awake. This ability allows WATCHDOG to catch
problems with machines mounting most or all of their directory tree
via NFS or similar means of remote file systems&mdash;this connection
can hang despite the local machine functioning correctly. Since
this hangup can cause huge problems, the WATCHDOG daemon tries to
access one file on this mount every time it awakes. If the
connection is down, it will not be able to refresh the timer, and
the system will be rebooted. WATCHDOG can be instructed to initiate
a soft-boot instead of the normal hard reset when any call returns
an error message.</p><p>At this point in the development of WATCHDOG, I released the
daemon as version 1.0 to all Debian archives and to
tsx-11.mit.edu.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2390580.0x2488c38"></a>What Has Changed Since Version 1.0?</h2></div></div><p>With more people using WATCHDOG some problems have been
encountered and fixed, and I began working on the one problem that
still worried me. From time to time the process table got so full
that no more processes could be started, so I changed WATCHDOG to
check the process table every time it is awake. If the table is
full, the system is rebooted. Doing a hard reset in this case
seemed a bad idea, so instead, WATCHDOG initiates a complete
shutdown. This action also posed a problem, since the process table
might stay full despite WATCHDOG's attempt to kill all processes.
For example, it is not possible to start the shutdown binary when
the process table is not empty. To take care of this situation
WATCHDOG contains code for the complete shutdown process, including
the following actions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>idles init, so nothing new can be started,</p></li><li><p>kills all processes,</p></li><li><p>writes a reboot record to wtmp,</p></li><li><p>turns off accounting,</p></li><li><p>turns off quota,</p></li><li><p>turns off swap,</p></li><li><p>unmounts all mounted partitions,</p></li><li><p>calls reboot.</p></li></ul></div><p>With this feature working correctly, version 2.0 was released
on July 30, 1996 to tsx-11.mit.edu and every Debian mirror.</p><p>Of course, there are more ideas that need implementation. If
anyone is in need of a check different from those described in this
article, please write me at meskes@debian.org.</p></div></div>
