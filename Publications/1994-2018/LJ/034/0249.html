    Tips from the Graphics Muse: web page fundamentals.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1711580.0x1809240"></a></h2></div></div><p>My first bit of musings is about the use
of images in web pages. I get a lot of e-mail from people who've
seen my web pages (or possibly my ramblings on various newsgroups
or mailing lists) asking how to do <span   class="emphasis"><em>blah</em></span> or
where can I get <span   class="emphasis"><em>blah</em></span> to do
<span   class="emphasis"><em>blah</em></span> for their web pages. The &ldquo;where&rdquo; parts
are in my HOWTO pages that can be found at:
http://www.csn.net/~mjhammel/linux-graphics-howto.html and
http://www.csn.net/~mjhammel/povray/povray.html.
</p><p>The &ldquo;how&rdquo; part is a broad question. I'll summarize. When
creating graphics for your pages, keep the following things in
mind:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Consider your target audience&mdash;home users:</p></li></ol></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Most home users have slow links. Even 28.8 modems
   don't load big graphics all that fast. Keep your images
   small.</p></li><li><p>Animation done in the same manner as cell-animation
   for cartoons (sequences of individual images with slight variations
   to simulate movement) requires that each cell be loaded across the
   Net. This is tantamount to one big image taking forever to
   load.</p></li><li><p>Most home users are still limited to 256 colors on
   their displays. Lots of users have upgraded to better graphics
   cards, but how many people do you want to alienate with an image
   requiring 10,000 colors?</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>If you want the average person to visit your page,
         you have to provide two things: content and flash. The flash has to
         be done using as little download time as possible, with as much
         color as you can squeeze in without overloading the browser
         (causing it to dither images). The content, not the flash, must be
         the reason for your pages.</p></li><li><p>Background images should be just that&mdash;in the
         background. Don't make the background so gaudy that it distracts
         from your content.</p></li><li><p>Use common color maps&mdash;this reduces the number of
         colors the browser has to allocate, leaving some space for other
         applications. X-based systems can allocate colors into private
         color maps, but this causes that annoying &ldquo;flashing&rdquo; you see (try
         running Netscape with the <b  >install</b> command line
         option, and you'll see what I mean).</p></li><li><p>Flash can be added easily with a simple background
         over which you add some in-line transparent GIFs.</p></li><li><p>Never use an &ldquo;Under Construction&rdquo; image. It's the
         Web. Of course it's under construction.</p></li><li><p>Don't put those silly graphic dots in place of HTML
         list bullets. First, they waste the user's time downloading (each
         requires another connection to the server), and second, they break
         the formatting rules provided with HTML. It's just not a good
         practice, and they don't add any real value to your pages.</p></li></ol></div></li></ul></div><p>Now that you know some basic guidelines for your images, how
do you go about creating the images? It depends on what kind of
images you want to make. If you want a simple, cartoon-like image
you can get a drawing program like xpaint. This tool is good for
drawing circles and boxes and filling them in, using a window like
a canvas to paint on the screen. However, it is limited in what you
can do to the image once you've drawn it. One highly popular tool
for a number of platforms that provides post-processing
capabilities is Adobe Photoshop. Using a tool like Adobe takes a
bit of practice, but once you've mastered it, you can do some
rather amazing things. A Linux alternative to Photoshop is The
GIMP, which can be found at http://www.XCF.Berkeley.EDU/~gimp/. The
logo on the Graphics Muse page in LG (Figure 1) was created with
The GIMP; so was the background (Figure 2).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="0249f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="0249f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Background, Graphics Muse Page
</p></div></div><p>Three dimensional images are another matter. There are
actually more well-known tools for doing 3D work than there are for
doing image manipulation (which is handled by tools like The GIMP).
Probably the best known of these is POV-Ray. This tool reads in a
text file that uses a &ldquo;scene description language&rdquo; to describe
how objects in the scene should be positioned and textured. The
drawback to these tools is that they lack a point-and-click
interface. There are separate tools, known as modelers, available
that allow the creation of the scene files without actually
rendering the image. In order to create a 3D image you need to
either learn the scene description language or learn how to use a
modeler that will create it for you.</p><p>Next month: How do you create the textures you apply to 3D
images? Beyond that, I'm considering writing about how to use Type
1 fonts in your images: how to install them, how you can manipulate
them with The GIMP to make interesting logos, etc. I'd also like to
provide some tips for using POV-Ray and BMRT (although I have a lot
to learn about the latter). And I might also cover how to do
animation. Things are pretty open right now. Let me know what you'd
like to hear about! (mjhammel@csn.net)</p></div></div>
