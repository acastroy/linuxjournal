    A document layout language, lout can also be used to generate graphs
    in PostScript.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x296a580.0x2a62450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Most documentation tools can also make
graphs. This article will show you how to use lout, a document
layout language, to create graphs. At the end we will have a script
which creates a history graph of system activity.
</p><p>First of all, lout is a document layout program which
generates PostScript. It was written by Jeffrey Kingston at the
Basser Department of Computer Science, the University of Sydney,
Australia. It is available on Red Hat distributions such as
Caldera's, and many Linux ftp sites. Also, the original sources are
available at ftp.cs.su.oz.au under the &ldquo;jeff&rdquo; directory.</p><p>In many ways, lout is a preprocessor for PostScript, since
many lout statements turn into PostScript instructions. In other
ways, lout is a language for writing structured documents&mdash;we
describe lists, sections, chapters, books and reports with lout
commands, and our text becomes the arguments to those commands. In
this article, we will focus on the commands in lout's graph
package, and ignore its other capabilities for documents.</p><p>In general, lout commands start with a commercial-at sign,
<b  >@</b>. Arguments to a command appear to its right,
enclosed in braces, and option settings can appear between the
command and its argument:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
@Command options  {  argument }
</pre><p>Usually the argument can contain lout commands also, so we'll
get nested groups of arguments with their braces helping to sort
everything out.
</p><p>Let's jump right in and take a look at a simple lout document
for a graph:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
@SysInclude {graph}
@SysInclude {doc}
@Doc @Text @Begin
@Graph { @Data pairs {solid}  { 1 1  2 10  3 5 } }
@End @Text
</pre><p>Put this into a file called graph.l, and run lout like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
lout -s -o ps  graph.l
</pre><p>lout reads the input file, and generates PostScript, writing it to
the output file, here called <b  >ps</b>. The
<b  >-s</b> tells lout that we have a stand-alone
document, and we don't want it to make its cross-reference files.</p><p>When you look at the resulting <b  >ps</b> file
with Ghostview (or print it to a printer), you'll see a nice little
graph at the top of the page. lout has automatically generated a
box, figured out some appropriate scales, plotted the lines and
displayed the graph. The graph package in lout has many options to
modify the characteristics of this graph; we'll see some of them
later.</p><p>For now, the important part is the <b  >@Graph</b>
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
@Graph  {  @Data  options  { data-values } }
</pre><p>This tells lout to make a graph from a data set in its
argument list. We gave the <b  >@Data</b> command the
option &ldquo;pairs {solid}&rdquo;, which tells lout that the data set has
pairs of x-y coordinate values, and that we want the data points
connected with solid lines.</p><p>As for the rest of the example, the
<b  >@SysInclude</b> commands tell lout which packages
we'll be using in the document. The <b  >@Doc</b> command
says that the body of the document follows, which is delimited by
the <b  >@Text @Begin</b> and <b  >@End
@Text</b> statements. And that's about as difficult as lout
gets.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x296a580.0x2a62df0"></a>System Activity Graph</h2></div></div><p>Suppose we want to make a system activity graph. We'll want
three curves, one each for the user, system and idle percentages.
The user percentage curve will be a solid line, with filled-in
circles to indicate each data point. The system and idle percentage
curves won't have symbols at each data point, but the system
percent curve will be dashed, and the idle percent curve will be
dotted.</p><p>Moving from the data sets to the graph itself, we want the
graph to fill the page, in a landscape orientation. There will be a
title at the top, a brief description below the graph, and a y-axis
label to the left. Instead of a legend box to identify the curves,
we want an appropriate label to the right of the last point in each
curve on the graph.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x296a580.0x2a62f50"></a>Implementation</h2></div></div><p>So that's what we want. How do we get there? We will use awk
as an interface between vmstat and lout. The overall flow will look
like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
vmstat  |  awk  |  lout
</pre><p>vmstat generates numbers for the system activity over a
period of time, and passes them on to awk. awk's role is to take
those numbers, collect the ones it needs, and generate
<b  >@Graph</b> and <b  >@Data</b> statements
for lout. Finally, lout takes its document and converts it to
PostScript. We can take the PostScript output and view it, print
it, or embed it elsewhere. If the system is up all the time, we can
even use a crontab entry to automatically print out daily activity
reports at the end of each day.
</p><p><a href="1372l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. SysAct</a></p><p>The complete script is shown in Listing 1. Let's step through
it together. The echo command sends the lout setup code; we include
the graph and doc packages, set the default font for the document,
and turn off the page headers to avoid getting page numbers.</p><p>After the <b  >@Text @Begin</b> statements, we show
the rotated graph, or, as expressed in lout:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
@Display 90d @Rotate @Graph { ... }
</pre><p>Here the <b  >@Rotate</b> command takes two
arguments: on its left, the number of degrees to rotate, and on its
right, the lout object to rotate. In this case, the object we
rotate is our entire graph.
</p><p>The <b  >@Graph</b> statement is followed by
several graph options. We set the graph size, and we set some
captions. We add a caption above the graph with
<b  >abovecaption { title text }</b>. Similarly, we add a
comment below the graph, and a y-axis label to the left of the
graph. Note that we rotated the <b  >leftcaption</b> so
that it would be parallel to the y-axis of the graph. After the
captions, we specify the tick marks on the x-axis. By default, lout
generated ticks only for every other minute. We can specify where
we want ticks and what to label each tick with the
<b  >xticks</b> and <b  >yticks</b> options. In
this case, the y-axis ticks are fine, but we want a tick and label
on the horizontal axis for each minute. The last two graph options
tell lout to not leave any free space between the graph curves and
the axes of the graph. This way, the bottom line of the graph box
becomes the 0% line of the chart.</p><p>Now that all the setup is done, we can start collecting data.
We call vmstat, and tell it that we want 60 samples taken 10
seconds apart, to collect data over a 10-minute period. We send
these measurements to awk.</p><p>Inside the awk script, we collect the user, system, and idle
percentages in separate arrays, taking care to skip over the header
lines. When vmstat exits, we'll use these saved values to generate
data sets for lout.</p><p>Inside the <b  >END</b> routine of the
<b  >awk</b> script, we first generate the lout code to
put the curve identifiers at the right side of the graph. In the
code, these appear in an <b  >objects { ... }</b> option
to the <b  >@Graph</b> command. This is a powerful
feature which lets us put nearly anything anywhere on the graph.
After the objects are written, we can generate the data sets. An
awk function generates the lout statements for us&mdash;we pass the
array name, the point-style, and the line-style to the routine
called <b  >gen_data</b>. It takes care of generating a
well-formatted data set for lout.</p><p>Finally, the awk script finishes the lout document by
declaring the end of the text with <b  >@End
@Text</b>.</p><p>The combined output of echo and awk are piped into lout,
which sends the PostScript for the system activity graph to its
standard output. This script could serve as the basis for many
other graphs:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>We could pass in the options to vmstat to get
better control over the sampling interval and duration.</p></li><li><p>Instead of rotating the graph to take up the full
page, we could leave it on a portrait-aligned page, and put
additional graphs below it (for swap, free and buffer memory,
perhaps).</p></li><li><p>We could instruct the awk script to highlight
severe system conditions by changing the line-style and point-style
in separate data sets when the data values become too high or too
low.</p></li><li><p>We could generate annotations for the graph
automatically, showing the time and percentage values when the
system percentage crosses some threshold.</p></li></ul></div><p>The principle is the same for any other data. Need a
disk-usage graph? Run <b  >du</b> through an interface
script and generate some lout code to graphically show the
disk-hogs on the system. Modify the script a little to get a
directory usage graph for a single user.</p><p>I hope this brief introduction has piqued your interest in
the graphing abilities of lout. For more information about lout,
see the excellent user and reference manuals that come with it.
They cover everything you'll need to know to use lout.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x296a580.0x2a5a700"></a>Availability</h2></div></div><p>Scripts for the system activity graph and a disk-usage graph
