    A quick guide to how CGI works and why it's
    a nightmare to debug.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1118580.0x12104a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>How often has this happened to you: You
finish a wonderful CGI program, place it on your server, fire it
up, and...much to your chagrin, you find your browser telling you
that there has been a &ldquo;server error&rdquo;, rather than the expected
output from the program?
</p><p>There is no shame in having this sort of thing happen;
experienced CGI programmers see this message plenty of times each
week. And while experience might reduce the number of errors a
programmer makes, more often it teaches him or her how to deal with
such problems.</p><p>This month, we will look at all the things that need to be in
place so that a web server can run your program. These problems
tend to cause programmers an awful lot of trouble, in part because
they change the programming paradigm we are used to from our other
programming experience.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1118580.0x1210660"></a>We Don't Run Things Directly</h2></div></div><p>Most programs are run directly, invoked from the command line
(or a graphical user interface), and then displayed on your screen.
But CGI programs are different; they are almost always run on a
different computer from the one at which the user is sitting.
Worse, CGI programs are twice-removed from the user&mdash;the user tells
the browser what he or she wants to do; then the browser has to
pass that data to the server, which then passes the request (and
any arguments) along to the program. Thus part of the secret of
debugging CGI programs simply involves understanding that the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>server</em></span> is invoking the program.</p><p>Just like all of the other programs on your system, CGI
programs must be executable. This isn't a big deal to remember when
you are coding in C and C++, since gcc and other compilers produce
an executable file that has the correct execution bits turned on.
But for those of us who write most of our programs in Perl (and
similar languages, such as Tcl and Python, which make use of the
Unix shell's interpreter), we need to make sure that the programs
are executable before they will run. This might sound obvious, but
believe me&mdash;from the e-mail I get, I can assure you that many
people writing and installing CGI programs forget to make sure that
their program is readable and executable not only to themselves,
but also by the user ID under which the web server is
running.</p><p>So, if you are getting an error message when running your CGI
program, go to the directory in which it is located, and use the
Unix &ldquo;chmod&rdquo; command to make it executable. Since you want to
make it executable to all users on the system&mdash;a good idea, given
that web servers often run under the &ldquo;nobody&rdquo; ID&mdash;we can issue
the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chmod a+x progname
</pre><p>Thus if my program is called &ldquo;progname&rdquo;, we can
double-check to make sure that the program is executable by issuing
the <span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> command with the
<b  >-l</b> option, indicating that it should provide
information in the &ldquo;long listing format&rdquo;. This means that we
should like to see information about the file's permissions,
ownership, and modification dates, as well as its name. If we list
our program, we should see something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
-rwxrwxrwx 1 reuven reuven 12779 Sep 5 15:28 progname
</pre><p>The above means that &ldquo;progname&rdquo; is owned by the user named
&ldquo;reuven&rdquo; and the group named &ldquo;reuven&rdquo; (not unusual on my
personal Linux box!), that it was last modified on September 5th at
3:28 p.m., and that it is 12779 bytes long. But most important is
the fact that we see the string &ldquo;rwx&rdquo; repeated three times&mdash;first
for the user (&ldquo;reuven&rdquo; in this case), then for the user's group
(again, &ldquo;reuven&rdquo; in this case), and then for everyone else on the
system. Thus the three instances of &ldquo;rwx&rdquo; mean that anyone on the
system can read, write, and execute progname, which is precisely
how we want things to be.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1118580.0x1210a80"></a>Running from the Command Line</h2></div></div><p>If the program is executable and still gives you problems,
your next step should be to run the program from the command line.
As I said earlier, we always have to remember that the web server
(most likely a different machine than ours) is executing the
program on our behalf, which means that we usually see not the
program's output, but rather the results of what our browser does
with that output! It's generally easiest to debug when we know
exactly what the program is doing, and thus it can only help to
execute the program on the web server itself.</p><p>So if the program is called &ldquo;progname&rdquo;, change into its
directory (using the <span   class="bold"><b>cd</b></span> command)
and type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        ./progname
</pre><p>Why precede the program's name with the
<b  >./</b>? Because your shell's <b  >PATH</b>
variable usually won't&mdash;and probably shouldn't&mdash;include your
system's CGI directory, which means that were you to simply type
the program's name, your <b  >PATH</b> might not work.
Unless you already include <b  >.</b>, a.k.a the current
directory, in your <b  >PATH</b>, which is extremely
convenient but also a potential security risk. Suffice it to say
that the above recipe always works, while leaving off the
<b  >./</b> won't always do the trick.
</p><p>When you execute the program, what do you see? Most important
of all is that a MIME header be the first thing the program sends
to its output. Browsers depend on MIME headers to know what sort of
data the program will be sending its way, and without such a
header, you will almost always get an error from your browser. Why?
Because if the browser expects to receive a MIME header, but
instead receives an HTML-formatted response from your program, it
will usually not know what to do. Rather than display data
incorrectly, your browser simply says (in its own terse way) that
it didn't understand what sort of data it should expect. It's up to
you to make sure that under all circumstances, anything sent to
standard output is preceded by a MIME header.</p><p>While there isn't enough space to go into the intricacies of
MIME headers this month, suffice it to say that unless your program
is going to output something other than HTML, you should always
make sure that the first thing it prints is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Content-type: text/html
</pre><p>Also note that this string should be followed by two newline
characters (<b  >\n</b> in C and Perl), rather than the
one that we are used to placing after text strings. That is, Perl
programmers should write:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
</pre><p>while those of you (wisely) using the CGI.pm module in Perl should
   be able to do the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
use CGI;         # Bring in the CGI module
my $query = new CGI; # Create an instance of CGI
print $query-&gt;header("text/html"); # Output the header
</pre><p>Why two newline characters? Simply put, those two newlines separate
your program's headers (i.e., information
<span   class="emphasis"><em>about</em></span> the response) from the content that it
returns (i.e., the response itself). There is at least one major
precedent for this system that you probably use all of the
time&mdash;e-mail! If you ever look at an e-mail message as transmitted
via SMTP (the Internet's Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), you will
see that the message's headers and contents are separated by a
blank line.</p><p>What else should you look for when running your program from
the command line? If your program is invoked using the
<b  >GET</b> method (i.e., if it is invoked as though it
were a document, without any arguments beyond perhaps some on the
command line), then invoking it from the command line should
produce some output, even if the output will be a bit weird because
of the lack of any input arguments. However, if your program looks
at the environment variable <b  >QUERY_STRING</b> as a
source of input, then you can easilyset that value from the Unix
shell. If you're using bash or some similar sh/ksh variant on your
system, then you should be able to type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
export QUERY_STRING="hello+there"
  ./program-name
</pre><p>Note that while you don't have to write characters in
<b  >QUERY_STRING</b> in the Web's &ldquo;percent-hex&rdquo;
encoding scheme (in which odd characters are replaced by a percent
sign, followed by the hexadecimal number representing their ASCII
code), I suggest that you do, if only to test your program in an
environment as close as possible to the one in which it will be
invoked. Remember that if we want to know why things are going
wrong, we need to pretend to be the web server invoking the
program&mdash;otherwise we might miss out on a subtle bug that has to do
with the encoding (or lack thereof).
</p><p>Testing out programs that use <b  >POST</b> is a
bit trickier, since the name/value pairs are difficult to emulate
when you are invoking the software on your own. But luckily for
those of us using Perl, the CGI.pm module allows us to run our
programs from the command line without too much trouble. If you
invoke a program that uses CGI.pm, you'll see:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
  ./program-name
(offline mode: enter name=value pairs on standard
input)
</pre><p>At this point, you can enter all of the names and values of
the elements in the HTML form that is supposed to invoke the CGI
program, followed by control-D. Of course, you don't necessarily
have to enter all of the form elements, particularly if you're
testing a large form&mdash;after all, debugging is supposed to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>save</em></span> you time! But it is certainly convenient
to be able to type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
name=Reuven
email=reuven@NetVision.net.il
address=17+Disraeli+Street
equation=2%2B2%3D4
&lt;control-D&gt;
</pre><p>and see the results of my program with that input, rather than
having to add lots of print statements to my program&mdash;a
tried-and-true system, and one which I certainly use, but this is
often much easier. Note that in the above examples, my address has
been entered with plus signs between the words (since the space
character cannot be transmitted as part of a URL), and with the
plus sign (+) and equals sign (=) encoded in percent-hex format.
</p><p>Since I'm already talking about Perl a bit, let me remind all
of you Perl programmers to use the <b  >-w</b> flag when
running your programs! The warnings it produces can be invaluable,
especially when coupled with the &ldquo;diagnostics&rdquo; package that
describes problems in more detail. You should also seriously weigh
using the &ldquo;strict&rdquo; package, which forces you to declare variables
a bit more formally than many Perl programmers are used to
doing&mdash;but the trade-off is that the Perl compiler is then able to
identify potential problems as it is looking at the program. Thus
most of my CGI programs have the following in their first few
lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/bin/perl5 -w
use strict;         # Interpret variable and
                    # subroutine names strictly
use diagnostics;    # Display documentation
                    # regarding each warning
                    # and error.
use CGI;            # Bring in the CGI module
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1118580.0x12117e8"></a>Was the Directory Configured for CGI?</h2></div></div><p>By this point, we know that the program is executable, that
it sends the correct MIME header before any other output, and that
it seems to work in at least a basic way if invoked from the
command line.</p><p>So assuming that there aren't any logic errors&mdash;which are
still a significant hurdle to overcome, even when all of these
logistical errors are out of the way&mdash;we should make sure that the
program is running in a directory that has been configured to run
CGI programs!</p><p>First, let's think about how most programs work: When you
request a document from a server, it generally makes sure that the
file exists. If the file does exist, the server returns the
document to the browser; if it doesn't, the server returns an error
message indicating that the file wasn't found.</p><p>CGI programs work slightly differently, though&mdash;in this case,
the server returns any output <span   class="emphasis"><em>returned</em></span> by the
program, rather than the program itself. Thus the server attempts
to execute the file as if it were a program, and then takes
whatever that program returns and passes it on to the user.</p><p>Now the question: How does the server know which files it
should simply return, and which should be executed first?</p><p>On most systems, that distinction is made by assigning
several directories to be for CGI programs. These directories,
traditionally called &ldquo;cgi-bin&rdquo;, contain the binaries (i.e., the
executables) for our CGI programs. Anything contained in these
directories is considered to be a program, and is executed;
anything sitting elsewhere is considered to be a text file. Thus if
your program is sitting in a non-CGI directory, its contents will
be sent to the user as if they were a text file, displaying
approximately what you would see if you were to use the Unix
<span   class="bold"><b>more</b></span> command. By the same token,
if you were to put one of your HTML documents in the CGI directory,
requesting it would almost certainly cause an error, since the
server would attempt to execute it!</p><p>Another approach, which is less common, allows users to place
CGI programs anywhere on the system, so long as their filenames
have certain suffixes&mdash;for example, <b  >.cgi</b> or
<b  >.pl</b>. The good news is that this allows users to
have their own CGI programs without forcing the system
administrator to configure a new CGI directory each time a user
wants to have a counter, or other common CGI program, on his or her
home page. However, CGI programs can be a security risk,
particularly when any user on the system can write or install
whatever programs he or she might want. Most system administrators
prefer being bothered with requests to create new CGI directories
to the potential security holes that might exist with the other
approach.</p><p>In either of these cases&mdash;the cgi-bin directory approach or
the &ldquo;any directory&rdquo; approach&mdash;users who experience problems with
their CGI programs should make sure that their programs are in the
right directories, that the CGI directories are set up for CGI
programs, and that they have the right suffixes. I often get e-mail
from people who wonder why they get the error <b  >cannot
perform POST method to the non-script</b> whenever they try
to execute their CGI program. What this admittedly terse and
cryptic error message is trying to say is, &ldquo;You tried to send data
from an HTML form to a file that doesn't appear to be a program. If
you want to set this up as a program, make sure to define it as
such on your system by using the appropriate
configuration!&rdquo;</p><p>The solution, then, is to make sure that your program is in
one of the directories declared to be for CGI programs. Your system
administrator should be able to do this by using the
<b  >ScriptAlias</b> directive (for NCSA httpd and
Apache), or the <b  >Exec</b> directive (for CERN httpd).
Once that is done, your program should run&mdash;although once again, I
should stress that just because all of the above steps are in order
doesn't mean that your program will work! It just means that your
server will be able to run it, and that the program will return at
least some results to your browser.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1118580.0x12086a8"></a>Next Time</h2></div></div><p>That's all the space we have for this installment. Next
month, we will discuss the httpd error log, to which our programs
send all of their error messages and warnings when things go wrong.
We will see how to read the error log, and how to understand what
it is saying when our programs don't work when we expect them
to&mdash;as well as how to use it to our advantage to make sure that our
programs work correctly.</p></div></div>
