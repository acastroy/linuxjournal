about using PGP and came across the comment that building PGP from
source for Linux was, well, difficult.</p><p>I have included a patch which will allow you to build PGP
2.62 on a Linux 2.0 box. (I'm running gcc 2.7.2, and a 2.0.25
kernel, so your mileage may vary with other setups).</p><p>Obtain the US distribution of PGP 2.6.2 from
http://web.mit.edu/network/pgp.html (this may work for the
international version, but I haven't tried it). Untar everything.
Following the instructions in setup.doc, do the following:</p><p><b  >cd rsaref/install/unix</b><b  >strip
pgp</b></p><p>Then do the tests setup.doc suggests.</p><p>There's definitely a cleaner way to do things, but I stopped
playing with it once it worked.  Sean C. Malloye-Net, Inc.,
smalloy@zilker.net</p><p>See <a href="1384l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> for the code
Sean included with his letter.</p><p>It was good to see Michael Johnson's introductory PGP article
in the December issue (#32). PGP can indeed be a bit of a challenge
to set up, as he notes. This is particularly true for people with
ELF systems. I put together a tips page for my local Linux user's
group when we had a meeting devoted to installing PGP and
integrating it with other applications. It's at
http://www.rust.net/~strix/pgphand1.htm.</p><p>You really don't need to be a cloak and dagger type to
appreciate PGP. In a more mundane setting, I like the ability to
keep things private (like course gradebooks) and discourage e-mail
forgery (&ldquo;emergency, exam
cancelled...&rdquo;).Regards,  strix@rust.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2528580.0x2620608"></a>More FreeBSD?</h2></div></div><p>In the December (#32) issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, a reader asks whether it would be possible to
see more FreeBSD-related articles. Your response mentioned an
informal survey, with which I must say I'm unfamiliar, citing a
lack of interest in the FreeBSD community.</p><p>I'm not sure how you were given such an impression, but I can
certainly say that such a verdict is rather inconsistent with my
own experience&mdash;we're always happy to see articles (or, indeed,
entire magazine issues) devoted to our operating system and
currently invest considerable energies in promoting it through
magazine articles, public presentations and trade show appearances.
I would be more than pleased to see the <i  >Linux Journal</i> take a greater interest in FreeBSD and, until
reading your response, was not even aware that such a possibility
really existed.</p><p>Though some of the more overzealous users in both camps might
perceive FreeBSD and Linux as operating systems in strong
competition, this viewpoint is both short-sighted and foolish. The
real dividing line here is free software vs. commercial software
and open systems with complete source code vs. &ldquo;open systems&rdquo;
which are open only in some marketing department's
imagination.</p><p>Linux and FreeBSD have far more in common than the zealots
would care to admit, and far more important than lineage is the
fact that both provide users with something none of the commercial
operating systems can match&mdash;a sense of actual control over the OS
environment and the ability to learn from or change any aspect of
it as they see fit, no longer tightly constrained by whatever
arbitrary restrictions the manufacturer chooses to impose on
them.</p><p>I hope that <i  >LJ</i> does someday extend its
reach beyond the implied focus of its title, making it clear the
real fight lies not between FreeBSD and Linux but in combating
market ignorance about the kinds of things of which free software
is capable and how truly viable an alternative to the much more
well-known commercial alternatives it can so often be.</p><p>The world of free software is only the richer for having
multiple solutions to choose from, each with its own unique
strengths and areas of coverage, and frankly, I wouldn't have it
any other way.  Jordan Hubbard  jkh@FreeBSD.org,
http://www.freebsd.org/</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2528580.0x26209d0"></a>Where Is Linux?</h2></div></div><p>Now more than ever, I find Linux to be the number one
operating system of choice for several reasons. Not only is its
stability far superior to some commercially developed operating
systems; the variety of applications available for Linux is
exploding like never before. Its practicality for Internet access
exceeds that of any other OS for the PC, and more hardware than
ever is supported by it.</p><p>I'm the president of the Computer Society at Western
Connecticut State University. The goals of the Society are to
enlighten and inform its members and to create a common ground on
which computer students, professionals, and educators can convene.
To meet ongoing demand, we hold Linux discussions and
demonstrations as frequently as possible. In addition, Linux is now
being used as the primary teaching tool for the Operating Systems
course. Not only are computer majors, professionals, and hobbyists
alike using Linux as a primary operating system; even those less
technically inclined are finding Linux suitable for everyday
tasks.</p><p>My only question has been and remains: Why are we still not
finding Linux distributions on the shelves of local software
stores? Currently, I see it widely available at trade shows, expos,
conventions, the computer sections of local book stores, and
several other locations the general public does not go for
software. So, while Joe or Jill Average shop around for new
software to try out on their computers, they never see Linux. Why
hasn't some company put Linux on the shelf where the light
shines? Cory Plock coryp@i84.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2528580.0x2620b88"></a>More Praise for Debian Linux</h2></div></div><p>Having just attempted to install Debian Linux, I read your
product review on Debian 1.1 in the November <i  >Linux Journal</i> (#31) with interest. My installation was plagued
by problems with an inconsistent file system on my CD from
iConnect, apparently as a result of &ldquo;growing pains&rdquo; in the
process of upgrading Debian to kernel version 2.0. The problems
gave me ample opportunity to correspond with the Debian &ldquo;bugs&rdquo;
server and the folks who develop and manage several of the various
packages which make up Debian Linux.</p><p>This led me to what I consider (in spite of my failed
installation) to be one of the real strengths of Debian Linux&mdash;a
feature not mentioned by the authors of the <i  >LJ</i>
article. Debian is obviously supported by many people who believe
strongly in its value and genuinely want it to work for everyone.
The Debian bug reporting system is well organized and efficient.
All my questions and problems were addressed promptly by folks who
not only sent me friendly and astute replies, but continued to
correspond with me, and in a couple of cases, asked for
<span   class="bold"><b>my</b></span> input and observations. Debian,
like GNU software and Linux itself, is truly a community
effort.</p><p>This is in stark contrast to my experience with another
popular distribution which I'm also using. After having SCSI host
adaptor problems with the distribution boot disk (identical to one
of the problems I had with Debian), I submitted a problem report to
both the distribution author and the primary distributor. After
several months, I have yet to hear from either.</p><p>The Debian folks at iConnect are sending me a replacement CD,
and I'll certainly give the distribution another shot.Lindsay

the growing thirst for computer technology in the secondary
schools. It's cost effective, it excels at networking, and the open
orientation of the Linux community offers an antidote to both the
Mac vs. PC turf wars and over-dependence on a few corporate
providers. Perhaps more importantly, Linux offers the option of
lots of cheap, reliable, quiet, easy-to-maintain, dumb terminals
attached to a single server, vastly increasing the
workstation-to-pupil ratio schools can achieve within their meager
budgets. Such terminals may not meet our expectations for colorful
graphics, but are quite adequate for teaching and using
communications skills (word processing, e-mail, ftp), office use
(records management), etc. Is anyone in the Linux community
targeting this area?  Jack McGregor jackmack@interserv.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2528580.0x2620fa8"></a>Graphics Are Important</h2></div></div><p>Hello, <i  >Linux Journal</i>! I've just read
<i  >LJ</i> issue 31 and was positively surprised that
most of the articles were about graphics. &ldquo;Multimedia&rdquo; is
important for the desktop market and the private user, but it was
forgotten in former times. I found the article on GGI an important
concept for Linux. It cannot be the future of Linux that all device
drivers must be programmed by hackers on the Net&mdash;the manufacturers
must be more involved in this part of developing. The GGI article
mentioned an essential way to achieve this: the manufacturer can
link his own optimized driver in object form into the system that
provides a well-defined interface to communicate with the special
type of device. I think this must be possible for any type of
device, so the manufacturer has minimal work to provide a driver
for Linux. Olaf Milbredt o.milbredt@gsn.pb.nw.schule.de</p></div></div>
