    With the 2.0 kernel, most Linux users now have the capability of
    using multi-threaded processes&mdash;well, what does that mean?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1968580.0x1a603a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Perhaps one of the reasons you use Linux
is because it is a multi-tasking operating system. In which case
you are probably well aware of the utility of being able to do more
than one thing at a time&mdash;perhaps compiling the utility which will
bring you fame and fortune whilst editing a letter of resignation
to your boss. So you might recognise the utility of an individual
process that can do more than one thing at once.
</p><p>When might this be a good idea? One application for
multi-threading is a program which relies on a large number of very
similar and independent mathematical operations&mdash;the oft-quoted
example of this is matrix multiplication. We look at a simple
example of a multi-threaded matrix multiplier later in this
article.</p><p>Another type of application which can benefit from
multi-threading is a server application. Whenever a client attempts
to connect to the server, a new thread can be created to look after
that client whilst the &ldquo;watcher&rdquo; thread continues to wait for
more clients to connect.</p><p>&ldquo;But wait!&rdquo; I hear you cry. &ldquo;Lots of server applications
already work like that, but they simply fork another process rather
than starting another thread.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You're right...&rdquo; I reply.</p><p>&ldquo;Don't interrupt,&rdquo; you continue. &ldquo;This sounds like another
way of doing the same thing, but for no good reason other than to
say it's a `multi-threaded application' and so you can bump up the
price to those who like to be blinded by science.&rdquo;</p><p>At this point I decide to ignore any more of your
interjections and just explain.</p><p>Yes, creating a new thread is very similar to forking a new
process, but there are differences. When a new process is forked,
it shares relatively little data with the parent process which
created it; when a new thread is created, it shares much more
information (such as all the global variables and static local
variables, the open files, and the process ID). The overhead of
creating separate copies of everything makes the creation of a new
process slower than the creation of a new thread. And the time it
takes to pass control from one process to another (a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>context switch</em></span>) is longer than the time
required to pass control from one thread to another. Also, since
the threads share their data space, passing information from one
thread to another is much more straightforward than passing
information from one process to another&mdash;while this does have its
own problems, it need not be difficult if a little care is taken. A
simple example of a multi-threaded server is given below.</p><p>A third type of application which could benefit from
multi-threading is a Doom-like game where each of the
computer-controlled baddies has its own &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; and can
act independently. The main game-play part of the program could be
in its own thread (or multiple threads), there could be another
thread handling each of the characters in the game who are
controlled by real people, and yet more threads for each of the
characters controlled by the computer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1968580.0x1a607c0"></a>POSIX Threads</h2></div></div><p>There is a POSIX standard for multi-threading: 1003.1c. If
you want to write portable programs (which doesn't seem like a bad
idea to me), it would be wise to stick to this standard rather than
use non-POSIX conforming libraries or using the raw system calls
which Linus so kindly provided in the Linux kernel (about which I
say just a little more later).</p><p>The examples in this article use POSIX multi-threading
functions called from C. However, the concepts in some non-POSIX
libraries and systems are often very similar. Solaris threads are
easily understood by someone familiar with POSIX threads, and while
Java threads and the multi-threading in the Win32 and OS/2 APIs are
a little different, there should be little in these which would
leave you quaking in your boots.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1968580.0x1a60920"></a>Linux Threading: Linus Gave Us
<b  >clone()</b></h2></div></div><p>Multi-threading capability is included in the version 2.0
Linux kernel (and many version 1.3 kernels). The
<span   class="emphasis"><em>clone()</em></span> system call creates a new
<span   class="emphasis"><em>context of execution</em></span>, or &ldquo;COE&rdquo; (to use
Linus' term), which can be a new process, a new thread, or one of a
range of possibilities which doesn't fit into either of these
categories. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>fork()</em></span> system call is actually
a call to clone() with particular values as parameters, and the
<span   class="bold"><b>pthread\_create()</b></span> function call
could be a call to clone() with a different set of values as
parameters. clone() is used by some implementations of
multi-threading libraries to provide <span   class="emphasis"><em>kernel
threads</em></span>, but further discussion of clone() is beyond the
scope of this article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1968580.0x1a60c38"></a>User-Level Threads Versus Kernel-Level
Threads</h2></div></div><p>Threading libraries can be implemented using kernel features
for creation and scheduling (such as clone()), or entirely in user
space where code in the library handles the creation of threads and
the scheduling between threads within a process. In general,
user-level thread libraries will be faster than kernel-thread
libraries. On the other hand, kernel-thread libraries are likely to
make better use of kernel facilities&mdash;if the kernel makes better
use of multiple processors in the next release, so might all your
multi-threaded programs. However, the programmer shouldn't need to
worry about whether the library is implemented as a user-level
library, a kernel-level library, or a combination of the two; the
operation of the program should be essentially the same.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1968580.0x1a60d40"></a>Available Libraries</h2></div></div><p>There are a many POSIX threads libraries available for Linux,
and some make no attempt to be POSIX-compliant. Also, some of the
POSIX threads libraries are compliant with an early draft of the
standard or just part of the standard. Anything which isn't
compliant with the final POSIX standard may show different
behaviour in some circumstances or have slightly different function
calls. That is not to say these aren't good multi-threading
libraries, but you should be aware of what you're using.</p><p>All examples in this article were tested with Xavier Leroy's
release 0.3 (ALPHA) of LinuxThreads, covered by the GNU Library
General Public License. This library is still being developed and
aims to be fully POSIX-compliant sometime in the future. It is
clone()-based, and so it has the advantages and disadvantages of a
kernel-level implementation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1968580.0x1a60ea0"></a>Don't Use Global Data</h2></div></div><p>As previously noted, multi-threaded programming isn't really
very difficult. However, there are ways to make life difficult for
yourself.</p><p>Guides to good programming often say to avoid using global
data. Maybe you've never seen the point of this&mdash;particularly if
you're a careful programmer and you know to look after your global
data. With multi-threading, there is another reason to avoid using
global data. Consider the trivial code fragments in
<a href="1363l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>.</p><p>When this function is called you would expect to see the
numbers &ldquo;0 1 2 3&rdquo; printed. And indeed, this is what would happen.
If you were to call this function from two different threads you
might expect to see two sets of the numbers printed, one from each
thread. If the two threads were to call this function at about the
same moment you might expect to see the two sets of numbers
interlaced, perhaps something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
0 1 0 1 2 2 3
3
</pre><p>Here, thread A calls fn(), which starts to print the numbers.
When thread A is only as far as &ldquo;1&rdquo;, thread B starts up and calls
fn(), which manages to get as far as &ldquo;2&rdquo; before thread A gets
control again. The call to fn() completes for thread A and thread B
gets control again and finishes off.
</p><p>However, this is not what would happen. Let me stress this is
<span   class="bold"><b>NOT</b></span> what would happen. Instead,
the output might be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
0 1 0 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14...
</pre><p>What is happening is thread A calls fn() which prints the
numbers up to &ldquo;1&rdquo;. Then thread B starts up and calls fn(). As the
<b  >for</b> loop is entered, the value of
<b  >i</b> is set to 0. Remember <b  >i</b> is
global, so it is shared by both threads&mdash;when thread B changes the
value of <b  >i</b>, thread A will see the same change.
The counter reaches the value &ldquo;2&rdquo;, at which point thread A is
given control again. When it attempts to increment
<b  >i</b>, it now reaches &ldquo;3&rdquo; and then &ldquo;4&rdquo;, at which
point thread A does not print the value of <b  >i</b> and
is ready to exit the function. When thread B gets control again, it
prints the current value of <b  >i</b> (which is &ldquo;4&rdquo;,
courtesy of thread A), increments it to &ldquo;5&rdquo;, then does the
comparison <b  >i!=4</b>. The comparison doesn't fail
(and will not fail for a <span   class="bold"><b>long</b></span>
time&mdash;not until <b  >i</b> has reached the maximum
<b  >int</b> value and looped around again), so the loop
continues printing numbers.
</p><p>This sounds horrible. It is horrible! And it can be avoided
by not using global data. If <b  >i</b> was declared
local to fn(), each thread would have its own copy and you would
get the expected output.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1968580.0x1a61738"></a>How To Use Global Data</h2></div></div><p>Sometimes you may find you need to use global data, either
because you are adding multi-threading features to an existing
program which cannot be rewritten, or because you believe global
data is the correct thing to use. Notice, in this context, I'm
saying &ldquo;global data&rdquo; when what I really mean is <span   class="emphasis"><em>shared
data</em></span>--the data may not be global to the program, but it
is global to (or shared between) one or more threads. In a
conventional, single-threaded program <b  >static</b>
local variables can be a useful convenience; however, these are
effectively global variables and if you don't take care with them,
they will cause you problems with bugs that can be very hard to
track down. So what do you do with global data? All you have to do
is make sure no other thread can change the value of your global
data between the time you set a value to that data and the time you
use the value. POSIX threads provides a number of ways of
performing this <span   class="emphasis"><em>synchronisation</em></span> between
threads. The simplest are mutual exclusion locks, or mutexes. A
thread locks a mutex at the start of a section of code, and unlocks
it at the end of that section of code. A thread which holds a lock
on a mutex is said to own that mutex. While one thread owns that
mutex, no other thread will be able to execute that same section of
code.</p><p>Consider our previous example with the runaway loop. We can
rewrite this so that it still uses global data, but with mutexes to
prevent two threads modifying the same loop counter at the same
time.</p><p>In <a href="1363l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>,
<b  >loopLock</b> is a mutex variable. Mutex variables
should always be initialised before use, either by a call to the
initialisation function <b  >pthread\_mutex\_init()</b>,
which can be used to set values for attributes which are particular
to that mutex variable, or by using the standard macro
<b  >PTHREAD\_MUTEX\_INITIALIZER</b> which uses default
values. These attributes can affect the priority and scheduling of
the thread which owns the mutex, or dictate which threads can
operate on the mutex (either those within the same process or any
threads which can access the memory where the mutex resides). We
make use of only default mutex attributes here.</p><p>When a thread makes a call to
<b  >pthread\_mutex\_lock()</b>, the mutex variable it
tries to own will be either free or owned by another thread. (If a
thread makes an attempt to lock a mutex which it already owns, the
result is undefined. Don't do it!) If the mutex is free, the thread
will take ownership of that mutex and
<b  >pthread\_mutex\_lock()</b> will return. If another
thread owns that mutex, the call will wait until the mutex comes
free and can claim ownership for its own calling thread. The thread
then owns that mutex until it makes a call to
<b  >pthread\_mutex\_unlock()</b>. (Again, if a thread
makes an attempt to unlock a mutex which it doesn't already own,
the result is undefined.)</p><p>As a result, if more than one thread tries to execute the
code in the function at the same time, then only the first will own
the lock and enter the loop. Any other threads will sit at the
<b  >pthread\_mutex\_lock()</b> call until the first
thread has exited the loop and unlocked the mutex. Then ownership
will be given to just one of the waiting threads which will be able
to enter the loop safely.</p><p>So if there are two threads which call this function at the
same time, the output will be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
0 1 2 3
0 1 2 3
</pre><p>As expected, each pass through the loop completes before the
next starts and the output is not interlaced.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1968580.0x1a58700"></a>Remember... Don't Use Global Data</h2></div></div><p>Of course, this problem has a much more elegant solution:
avoid using the global data in the first place. In
<a href="1363l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a>, the loop counter is
local to the function and there is no conflict; each call to the
function has its own version of <b  >i</b>, and so each
thread which calls that function will have its own version of
<b  >i</b>.</p><p>However, two (or more) different threads can be inside the
loop at the same time and so the output can be interlaced, as we
originally expected. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
0 1 0 1 2 2 3
3
</pre><p>If it is not appropriate for your application to have more
than one thread within a certain piece of code at the same time
(this piece of code is commonly referred to as a <span   class="emphasis"><em>critical
section</em></span>), you may still wish to use mutexes, even though
you do not have shared data.
</p><p>Remember, though, critical sections can negate some of the
advantages of multi-threading by forcing threads to wait for
others. It is a good idea to keep any necessary critical sections
as short as possible.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1968580.0x1a58ac8"></a>Thread-Safe libc</h2></div></div><p>What the programmer may need to be aware of is whether the
other libraries being used are <span   class="emphasis"><em>thread-safe</em></span> or
not. Otherwise, problems such as those described above may (or,
more likely, will) occur. A good example is with every C and C++
programmer's friend, <b  >errno</b>. When a system call
fails for some reason, it is common for the function called to
return a generic failure value (such as <span   class="emphasis"><em>NULL</em></span>
or -1) and an indication of why it failed in
<b  >errno</b>--which is, of course, a global variable.
Just think of the confusion if one thread calls
<b  >putenv()</b>, which fails and sets
<b  >errno</b> to <b  >ENOMEM</b>. Then there
is a context switch and another thread calls
<b  >open()</b> and fails, setting
<b  >errno</b> to <b  >ELOOP</b>. Then there is
another context switch; the return value from
<b  >putenv()</b> is checked, the failure is spotted, and
confusion breaks out because it looks like
<b  >putenv()</b> failed with <b  >ELOOP</b>,
which is not possible.</p><p>Or consider the standard function
<b  >strtok()</b>. This breaks a string into tokens and
works in two ways. On the first call, you pass in a string which is
to be tokenised. It stores this string in a static area. On
subsequent calls you pass in a NULL string and
<b  >strtok()</b> works its way through the already
stored string. If two threads call <b  >strtok()</b>
concurrently, the first one will have its stored string overwritten
by the string that the second tells <b  >strtok()</b> to
store.</p><p>Fortunately, thread-safe versions of <b  >errno</b>
and thread-safe versions of standard functions within libraries are
now available. Take a look at
<b  >/usr/include/errno.h</b>, for example. If you have a
recent set of include files you may find the following bit of
code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#if defined(_POSIX_THREAD_SAFE_FUNCTIONS) || \
defined(_REENTRANT)
extern int*     __errno_location  __P((void));
#define errno   (*__errno_location ())
#else
extern int errno;
#endif
</pre><p><b  >errno</b> is redefined to be an
<b  >int</b> returned by a function, rather than the
usual global variable, when either
<b  >\_POSIX\_THREAD\_SAFE\_FUNCTIONS</b> or
<b  >\_REENTRANT</b> has been defined.
</p><p>When compiling code for multi-threaded programs, always
use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#define _REENTRANT
</pre><p>in your code (or use the compiler option
<b  >-D\_REENTRANT</b> to make use of this thread-safe
macro for <b  >errno</b>).
</p><p>Similarly, recent versions of libc contain thread-safe
versions of standard unsafe functions. So there is now the usual
unsafe <b  >strtok()</b>, but also a thread-safe function
<b  >strtok\_r()</b>--see your man pages for the
details.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1968580.0x1a597d8"></a>Creating a Thread</h2></div></div><p>All this, and we still haven't created a thread! Okay, let's
put that right. <a href="1363l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a> is a
very trivial, and complete, example of a multi-threaded
program.</p><p>When I compile (with <b  >cc helloworld.c -o helloworld
-lpthread</b>) and run this program, I get the output:
<b  >Hello world world Hello Hello world world Hello Hello
world world Hello Hello world world Hello Hello world world
Hello</b></p><p>Let's take a look at this program. There is a mutex variable
<b  >printfLock</b>; this may not be strictly necessary,
but it is included just in case we are not using a thread-safe
version of libc&mdash;just to be safe, mutex locking is put around the
call to <b  >printf()</b>.</p><p>There are two new function calls in
<b  >main()</b>: <b  >pthread\_create()</b> and
<b  >pthread\_join()</b>. The first of these, not
surprisingly, creates a new thread. The first parameter points to a
variable of type <b  >pthread\_t</b>; this can be used to
identify the newly created thread, not unlike the file-handle
returned from the <b  >fopen()</b> call. The second
parameter allows you to set various attributes for the new thread.
If the value is <b  >NULL</b>, default attributes are
used, and this is fine for now. The third parameter is the function
which the thread is to execute; this is always a function which
takes a <b  >void*</b> as a parameter and has a
<b  >void*</b> return value. The fourth parameter is the
argument which is to be passed as a parameter to the thread
function defined in parameter 3.</p><p>As soon as <b  >pthread\_create()</b> has
successfully created a new thread, the function which is passed as
the third parameter will be running.</p><p>In this example, the thread function takes a string as an
argument and prints that string ten times before exiting. As you
can see from the output, both threads execute at the same time and
their output is interleaved.</p><p>The <b  >pthread\_join()</b> function waits for the
specified thread (identified using the
<b  >pthread\_t</b> variable returned in parameter one of
the thread creation) to exit. A thread exits when the thread
function returns, or when the thread makes an explicit call to the
function <b  >pthread\_exit()</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1968580.0x1a5a0c8"></a>Matrix Multiplication</h2></div></div><p><a href="1363l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6</a> shows a simple

</pre><p>There are a number of things worth noting about this
program.</p><p>First of all, you will probably get a speed increase using a
multi-threaded program like this only if you have a system with
more than one processor. Why? Because with a single-processor
system the one processor must perform all the calculations
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> spend extra time scheduling between the
different threads. With a multi-processor system, the scheduler may
be able to run the same process over multiple CPUs by
simultaneously running a different thread on each.</p><p>Secondly, it uses global data. And after I went to all that
trouble to say it was a dangerous thing to do. And I don't even use
mutexes. You might well be offended! However, I wanted to
illustrate a case when it <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> safe to use
global data. (Whether it is a good idea to use global data is
another issue, and that line of philosophical debate is not the
purpose of this article&mdash;I am simply showing that global data
<span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> be used.) Why is it safe here? Well, the
two matrices <b  >mat1</b> and <b  >mat2</b>
are read-only; the <b  >result</b> matrix is written to,
but each of the threads only writes to a specific part of the array
which is used to store the resulting column which that thread is
working on. There is never any conflict.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1968580.0x1a5a6f8"></a>A Simple Server</h2></div></div><p><a href="1363l7.html" target="_self">Listing 7</a> shows one way in
which a simple multi-threaded server could be constructed.</p><p>Please note, as in all the examples, error checking has been
kept to a minimum in order to keep the code simple and readable.
&ldquo;Real&rdquo; code needs to be much more robust than this. Always check
the man pages for possible return-codes and error-values.</p><p>The server works as follows: it listens on port 12345 to
service requests from clients, and it also performs an unrelated
task without regard to client activity (that is, it prints &ldquo;server
is running&rdquo; onto standard output every second).</p><p>In thread terms, it works as follows: the main thread creates
a thread to listen for clients connecting to the server port, then
it goes into an infinite loop, printing the &ldquo;running&rdquo; message,
then sleeping for one second. The &ldquo;client listening&rdquo; thread
listens to a socket on port 12345. Whenever a client connects to
that socket (e.g., someone types &ldquo;telnet hostname 12345&rdquo;) the
connection is accepted and another thread is started to handle just
that one client. The &ldquo;client listening&rdquo; thread then continues to
listen for more clients connecting. The &ldquo;client handling&rdquo; thread
prints a useful message to the client (&ldquo;type `X' to quit&rdquo;), then
waits for the client to send a message back. If the message begins
with &ldquo;X&rdquo;, the socket is closed and the thread exits; otherwise,
the message is printed again and the thread waits once more for
data from the client.</p><p>In a server written in this way, there is a thread running
for each client that is simultaneously connected. This gives the
advantages of a server which forks a new process for each client
that connects, but without the extra overheads involved in forking
a new process or in switching between processes, and with the
ability to communicate easily within threads.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1968580.0x1d6df58"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>Writing multi-threaded programs need not be difficult
(certainly not as difficult as some people would have you believe),
although it is certainly possible to make life difficult for
yourself. It is more often useful on multi-processor systems than
uni-processor systems. But there are many cases where performance
can be improved on uni-processor systems by multi-threading, such
as when handling requests from multiple simultaneous connections in
a client/server application, when overlapping multiple I/O
requests, or when writing programs which make use of graphical user
interfaces.</p><p>Most of the topics discussed here should be applicable to
non-Linux systems and (somewhat more loosely) to non-POSIX
systems.</p></div></div>
