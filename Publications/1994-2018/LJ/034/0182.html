is the much revised and enhanced second edition of O'Reilly's
familiar <span   class="emphasis"><em>Practical Unix Security.</em></span> This book
amounts to a survey course that covers everything from the basics
to the advanced topics, not always to equal depth, but more than
well enough to get you started in the right direction when you need
to tackle a new topic or one you are a little rusty on. You may
need additional resources. The 47 pages of well-annotated
bibliography and resource lists found at the end should help
greatly with further reading, contacts and so on.</p><p>The emphasis is on understanding principles. To the reader is
left the exercise of implementing an appropriate and well-designed
security strategy. This is good, for there are not likely to be
many cut-and-dried approaches of any generality worth their salt. A
useful strategy may vary a lot from site to site, and from time to
time. No one book could even hope to cover in great detail all
situations and all varieties of Unix. This book sets out to furnish
the broad background and the perspective necessary to such an
undertaking. I believe the authors have risen well to their task.
Notwithstanding the overall very general approach, many detailed
examples of procedures are given, to illustrate and anchor the
discussion, and to give the Unix novice a place to start on this
rather complex topic. Too many books about computing never descend
to a concrete plane, and their lessons may be lost on just those
who could benefit most. This book avoids that pitfall. Indeed, the
experienced reader will likely skip many of the examples, while
appreciating the insights and points of interest found between
them. The beginning of the book talks about Unix basics: the file
system, permissions, devices, users and passwords. Much of these
several chapters is spent talking about organizational issues as
well. This is appropriate, as Unix security is not merely a
technical issue, but has a substantial social dimension.
Accordingly, policy, history and risk assessment are treated
briefly here. The common sense approach taken is exemplified by
this passage (page 44):</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The key to successful risk assessment is to
identify all of the possible threats to your system, but only to
defend against those risks which you think are realistic
threats.</em></span> Chapters on advanced topics include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Cryptography</p></li><li><p>Telephone Security</p></li><li><p>UUCP</p></li><li><p>TCP/IP Networks</p></li><li><p>TCP/IP Services</p></li><li><p>WWW Security</p></li><li><p>RPC, NIS, NIS+ and Kerberos</p></li><li><p>NFS</p></li><li><p>Firewalls</p></li><li><p>Wrappers and Proxies</p></li><li><p>Secure SUID and Network Programs</p></li></ul></div><p>as well as a whole section on handling security incidents.
The appendices have some very nice security checklists.
</p><p>I found most of the information presented accurate and
up-to-date, though of course not always complete. There were some
exceptions. For example, in the chapter on UUCP (page 421):</p><p>UUCP was designed and optimized for low-speed connections.
When used with modems capable of transmitting at 14.4 Kbps or a
faster rate, the protocols become increasingly inefficient.</p><p>The authors are perhaps correct about historical UUCP, which
unfortunately represents what is currently shipping from many
vendors. A modern UUCP, such as the Taylor UUCP present in most
Linux distributions, will give even the fastest competing file
transfer methods a run for their money, over the same connection.
If it were not for the negative tone about UUCP the authors take in
this chapter, I'd chalk this one up as information that just didn't
make the cut. In a later chapter, while offering alternatives to
the expense of installing and maintaining a firewall, the authors
finally touch on the tip of the UUCP iceberg (page 668):</p><p>Use a hard-wired UUCP connection to transfer email between
your internal network and the Internet. This connection will allow
your employees to exchange email with other sites for work-related
purposes, but will not expose your network to IP-based
attacks.</p><p>Bingo! This is one of several reasons why many businesses and
individuals in the Seattle area, and no doubt elsewhere, use UUCP
for some or all of their e-mail service. Too bad it didn't rate
mention back where they were discouraging us from even considering
UUCP. An amusing comparison of Linux and the GNU utilities with
some others is found on page 704. The authors cite a study using a
program called &ldquo;fuzz&rdquo; in which Unix utilities crashed when
presented with random inputs. Over a quarter of standard Unix
utilities crashed, while less than a tenth of Linux (mostly GNU)
utilities tested did so. Though all the commercial vendors were
presented with the results of these tests, a re-test some years
later gave similar results. While as much as one utility in ten is
still pretty high, it is a testimony to free software and GNU in
particular that the levels attained are significantly lower than
those in commercial systems. The implication drawn, however, is
less amusing. The authors point out, correctly, that many of the
same problems that will make a program crash on random input, will
allow a skilled attacker who is adept at exploiting the mechanisms
of the crashes, such as buffer overflows and array bounds
violations, to obtain behavior from a program not anticipated by
its authors or installers. Woven through this work are discussions
of software quality, an issue dear to my heart. Garfinkel and
Spafford touch on these in the introduction (pages 17-18): @quote:[
... ] software designers are not learning from past mistakes. For
instance, buffer overruns ... have been recognized as a major Unix
problem for some time, yet software continues to be discovered
containing such bugs, and new software is written without
consideration of these past problems [ ... ]</p><p>A more serious problem than any particular flaw is the fact
that few, if any, vendors are performing an organized program of
testing on the software they provide ... few apparently test their
software to see what it does when presented with unexpected data or
conditions.</p><p>In the chapter &ldquo;Writing Secure SUID and Network Programs&rdquo;
they spend much more time on this theme. Lists of good, basic,
common-sense rules are found there, such as &ldquo;Don't use routines
that fail to check buffer boundaries when manipulating strings of
arbitrary length.&rdquo; Violations of this rule alone have resulted in
several CERT advisories, including, I suspect, a very recent
advisory concerning a popular e-mail transfer program. Many other
guidelines found in this chapter could in the past have prevented a
number of serious breaches of security. For example, &ldquo;check all
return codes from system calls&rdquo; and &ldquo;Using the access() function
followed by an open() is a race condition, and almost always a
bug.&rdquo; Perhaps one of these guidelines will help me, some day soon.
I think I'll put this book on my night stand, for evenings of
enjoyable late-night study as the rainy season moves in.</p></div></div>
