administrator's nightmare has come true: every user on his system
wants to have a home page and wants to do CGI programming. The urge
to be on the Web is too strong to keep them off. If they had some
elementary knowledge of security, things would not be so bad, but
this is not the case: most of those users grew up with MS-DOS,
where insecurity is a de facto standard. They have a dangerous
attitude toward your system.
</p><p>One major problem with CGI programming is writing to a file;
the web server doesn't run as the user who wrote the CGI
script&mdash;when it tries to write something in a file, it gets a
permission denied error. Lowering the permission of that file isn't
a solution&mdash;it is just plain disastrous.</p><p>As you might know, a web server (typically called
<b  >httpd</b>) can be run by any user. However, if you
want to have the server listening on the HTTP port (port no. 80
according to STD 2, the Internet standard describing &ldquo;Assigned
Numbers&rdquo;, at this moment, RFC 1700), it must be started up as
root. Normally this is done at boot time from one of the rc files
located in /etc. Since running the web server as root is a serious
breach of security, all web servers can be configured to run as a
different user, say user &ldquo;www&rdquo;.</p><p>You normally would see one server, running as root, which is
responsible for opening port 80 and forking off a copy of itself
that is running as www. It starts up as many servers as are needed
to handle your load (you can often set a minimum and maximum number
of servers in the configuration files). The one running as root
does no HTTP stuff&mdash;that is done by child servers running as
www.</p><p>There is one inherent security risk in running CGI scripts
when everybody can write CGI scripts: the scripts can be read by
other users. Even if you remove read permission of others and make
the script readable and executable by the server's group only,
another person can write a script reading the source of your
script. If it is important that the source of the program remains
secure, you shouldn't be writing a script. Compiled programs don't
have to be readable to be executable, whereas scripts must be both
readable and executable.</p><p>Before we proceed with the real issue, just consider a few of
the consequences of the server running as www. Consider the
following script:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
cp /bin/sh /home/cracker/bin/sh
chmod 4755 /home/cracker/bin/sh
cat &lt;&lt; EOF
Content-type: text/plain
There is no such thing as a secure server!
EOF
</pre><p>You now have created a suid www shell that any cracker can
use! For this reason it is important that the user www not have a
home directory and not own any important files. Another infamous
trick is to send a STOP signal to all servers; that is really
sneaky (do you know why?). If you find these kinds of scripts
unacceptable, you should ban CGI programming for everybody on your
system except a few trusted users.
</p><p>It should be clear that running all your servers as root is a
definite no-no. It is like removing the password entry of root from
the password file. If all your servers run as root, dash to your
system administrator to correct this and don't leave before it is
corrected. If he is hard to convince, well, you have root
privileges and maybe you should give him a demonstration of how you
can correct his mistake!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2441580.0x25397c0"></a>Bad Things</h2></div></div><p>The trouble starts when user foo wants to write something in
a file. Well, just for the sake of argument we will increment an
access counter in a file ~foo/www/access. For example, look at the
script counter.sh (it is not very customary to use a Bourne script
for CGI programming, but it does the job):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
ACCESS=
ACCESS=
rm /home/foo/www/access
echo $ACCESS &gt; /home/foo/www/access
cat &lt;&lt; EOF
Content-type: text/plain
You are number $ACCESS to visit this page!
EOF
</pre><p>A nice little script with one problem: it does not work. It
would have worked if foo had executed it, but alas, www was the one
who ran the script. User foo might then immediately lower his
security by entering: <b  >chmod 666 access</b>. And
since he noticed his default permissions are always wrong, he makes
sure he regularly does a <b  >chmod 666 *</b>--being
unaware of the option of setting his UMASK. Don't think this
doesn't occur in real life&mdash;I've had several colleagues doing
exactly that. Be assured, they were all dedicated MS-DOS users.
</p><p>Some of them learned it is easier if he doesn't change the
files individually, but rather the directories (I almost jumped out
of my room when I heard this one): <b  >chmod 777 .</b>
He didn't realize the writing succeeded because the daemon was able
to remove the file access. But not just www could have done
it&mdash;anybody could have done it!</p><p>Quickly entering <b  >chmod 1777</b> may seem the
right thing to do. Don't you believe it. Indeed, it isn't
<span   class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> bad, but still, anybody on your system
can remove that file with a CGI script.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2441580.0x2539be0"></a>Good Things</h2></div></div><p>It's time for something less depressing. Can you do it right?
Sure you can&mdash;it just takes a little bit of effort. The problem is
you don't really want your CGI scripts to be executed by a stranger
like www. You want to have your scripts running as yourself! For
the execution of programs as another user, suid and sguid were
invented.</p><p>If you make a program suid (or sgid), you run it as the user
(or group) who owns the file. That was exactly what you wanted in
the first place. So you make your scripts suid. And still under
Linux it doesn't work. Why? Because suid scripts are insecure and
the Linux kernel refuses suid scripts altogether (look at the
comp.os.unix FAQ for some stunning ways to become root).</p><p>But suid programs are safe to use. It only means that you
have to write a wrapper, a little C program, counter.c, which you
make suid:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
void main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
   exit(system("/home/foo/www/bin/counter.sh"));
}
</pre><p>Does this suid stuff always work? No&mdash;many system
administrators mount /home as nosuid, meaning the suid bit will
never be honored. Why does a system administrator want to do that?
Well, you noted the first script in the article that made a suid
shell? That wouldn't have worked if /tmp was mounted nosuid. Many
system administrators mount only those file systems as suid which
must contain suid programs, mounting all others nosuid; for
instance, /home doesn't need suid programs for the system to run,
so mounting nosuid is a pre-cautious action.
</p><p>But there is another way. It's a bit like shotgun
programming, but you can let sendmail and procmail do the dirty
work for you. How does it work? Basically you let the daemon send
you mail that will instruct you to perform a certain task. The
receiving sendmail will look in your ~/.forward and see that you
want your mail to be processed by procmail, which will perform the
update script for you. Let me first give you the CGI script:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
ACCESS=
ACCESS=
cat &lt;&lt;EOF
Content-type: text/plain
You are number $ACCESS to visit this page!
EOF
echo "Subject: access.sh 1928397071" | sendmail foo
</pre><p>First some remarks about the mail:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>This mail has no body, which is allowed by RFC 822
(the Internet standard describing the format of mail messages). If
you want to include a body, you should precede the body by a
mandatory empty line.</p></li><li><p>In the subject we have a script part access.sh that
will hint at what script to run. It has some sort of a magic cookie
(1928397071) to prevent you from processing e-mail which is
accidently triggered. If you want this to be a really secure
cookie, you shouldn't be writing this line as a script.</p></li></ul></div><p>Next it is time for the ~/.forward:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
"|IFS=' '&amp;&amp;exec /usr/bin/procmail -f-||exit 75 #bar"
</pre><p>The program procmail needs to look in your file ~/.procmailrc
(which shouldn't be world readable, if you want to use cookies for
security):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
LOGFILE=$HOME/log/procmail
:0 b
* ^From www
* ^Subject: access.sh 1928397071
|$HOME/www/bin/access.sh
</pre><p>So if the daemon sends a mail with a subject <b  >access.sh
   1928397071</b>, procmail will run access.sh for you:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
ACCESS=
ACCESS=
rm /home/foo/www/access
echo $ACCESS &gt; /home/foo/www/access
</pre><p>Mission accomplished: we have written something safely into a file.
Are there any catches? Yeah, sure.</p><p>First of all, you need to assure that when two people try to
access your page, they won't screw up your files. You need some
sort of file locking mechanism (check out <b  >flock</b>,
which also is available in Perl).</p><p>Secondly, the sendmail in the CGI script is nonblocking: it
doesn't wait until the update is actually done. In most cases, this
doesn't really matter, as you are only doing a simple update.
Otherwise, you can always try to implement the Perl client-server
model.</p><p>Don't go for the easy insecure option; keep it safe. Your
system administrator will appreciate it.</p></div></div>
