    xldlas offers a straightforward way to summarize data, plot it
    and
    perform regressions on it&mdash;and it was written for Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bc5580.0x1cbd4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Linux is a virtually unparalleled
platform for using freely distributable software. The kernel source
is free, the standard utilities are free and so is the X Window
System. The whole concept of using free software is incredibly
appealing, and many users are tempted to try running their systems
without any commercial products whatsoever. Yet this desire is
often thwarted by a single missing application; desktop publishing
and presentation software are commonly cited as current &ldquo;holes&rdquo; in
the Linux arsenal.
</p><p>I was faced with such a problem when I decided to abandon the
MS-DOS partition on my hard drive and go all Linux. Since I work
with a fair amount of statistical information, I needed a
straightforward way to summarize data, plot it and perform
regression as needed. gnuplot is great for plotting, but that's all
it does. Octave and MuPad have powerful numerical features, but
they are overkill for simple statistical chores. Unable to find a
program that fit this niche, I decided to write one. The result is
xldlas, a program for statistics. In the grand Unix tradition, its
name is a pseudo-acronym which stands for &ldquo;x
<span   class="bold"><b>l</b></span>ies,
<span   class="bold"><b>d</b></span>amned
<span   class="bold"><b>l</b></span>ies,
<span   class="bold"><b>a</b></span>nd
<span   class="bold"><b>s</b></span>tatistics.&rdquo; The first public
release in October 1996 met with quite positive feedback from
users, and one of those beta testers (Hans Zoebelein) suggested an
article in <i  >Linux Journal</i> might be a good way
to introduce xldlas to a wider audience. The people at
<i  >LJ</i> agreed, and asked me to write this
overview. The program runs under the X Window System, and is built
using the XForms library. You'll find information on how to
download xldlas and associated software at the end of this
article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bc5580.0x1cbd870"></a>Using xldlas</h2></div></div><p>The philosophy behind xldlas is to offer standard statistical
tools via an easy-to-use point and click interface. To facilitate
this approach, common commands are grouped together into a set of
menus. In addition, frequently used commands are available via
buttons (See Figure 1).</p><p><a href="1371f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1: The
xldlas User Interface</b></span></a></p><p>Like most statistics packages, xldlas handles a random
variable as a vector of values. So a single variable name can refer
to dozens, hundreds or thousands of observations.* By grouping data
points together under variable names, it is easy to perform
relatively complex operations by selecting a few variables and
clicking on the relevant command.</p><p>*By default, xldlas has a limit of 100 variables of 10,000
observations each. These constraints can easily be adjusted by
changing the values for MAX_VARS and MAX_OBS in the source code
file xldlas.h.</p><p>Of course, before you can perform any kind of statistical
operations, you have to get data into xldlas. Since ASCII is the de
facto standard for exchanging information under Linux, xldlas
allows you to read in space-delimited data from a text file by
using the Import command. You supply a file name, and tell xldlas
whether the data is in column or row format. The import routine
automatically figures out how many variables and observations there
are, and reads in the data. To take a concrete example, suppose you
have a file which contains space-delimited data on rainfall,
temperature and barometric pressure for a single location. After
importing this file, xldlas will have three variables in memory,
which will be called unknown0, unknown1 and unknown2. You can
change these names to anything you like using the Rename command,
which is accessible from the Data menu. In addition to this simple
ASCII format, xldlas can read and write sets of data in its own
proprietary file format. By convention, these files have an .lda
extension. Since variable names, descriptions and other useful
information are stored in these files, it's generally a good idea
to save all your data this way if you plan on using xldlas
frequently. The Load, Save and Import commands can all be found in
the File menu. To input data by hand, erase variables or perform
any kind of editing, there are a number of related commands grouped
together in the Data menu. Of these, the most frequently used is
probably the Describe command, which generates a table in the main
xldlas window showing you the name, number of observations, and a
description of every variable currently in memory. In addition to
changing observation values, the Edit command can also be used to
enter a description for a variable.</p><p>Another frequently used item in the Data menu is the Generate
command. This routine allows you to perform mathematical
transformations on existing data. To continue with the weather
example from above, suppose we want to convert our rainfall
variable from millimeters to centimeters. With a few clicks of the
mouse, we can easily accomplish this task. We could also add some
random noise, find the log of the data, or what have you. It's a
far cry from Mathematica, but for simple operations the Generate
command is quick and easy to use.</p><p>Once you have your data loaded, edited and transformed, the
next logical step is to perform some kind of statistical work on
it. To get a tabular summary of a single variable, including mean,
variance, skewness and kurtosis, there's the Summarize command. If
you want to check multiple variables for linear relationships, the
Correlation command will produce a table of Pearson coefficients.
Similarly, the ANOVA command lets you perform one-way and two-way
analyses of variance by simply selecting variable names with your
mouse and clicking the Go button.</p><p>The workhorse of statistical techniques, ordinary least
squares regression, is available via the Regress command. Just
select a single variable from the dependent browser, any number
from the independent browser, and press Go. If you want to store
fitted values, then you can enter a new variable name in the
regression window. The output of the regression command is a set of
three tables, which summarize the fit of the regression, break down
the sum of squares deviations and list coefficient estimates.
Relevant t-statistics and their associated probabilities are
automatically included, as is the F coefficient and confidence
level for a joint test of all the estimates.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>xldlas</b></span> also offers two
experimental data fitting routines that use connectionist
artificial intelligence techniques. The first, GA Fit, uses genetic
algorithms to build a fit equation that minimizes the sum of
squares between fitted values and actual observations of a given
dependent variable. The second, NN Fit, creates a back-propagation
neural network using selected independent variables for the input
layer, and a single dependent variable for the output layer. In
both cases, the fitted values from these techniques can be stored
under a supplied variable name. These routines are sometimes useful
for exploring non-linear relationships in data that are generally
difficult to examine using standard OLS regression.*</p><p>*Although not part of the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; statistical toolkit,
these sorts of AI techniques are becoming increasingly common in
various contexts and are great for data mining. Although their
implementations in xldlas are fairly rudimentary, more
sophisticated modifications are likely if users request
them.</p><p>In addition to manipulating data and performing analysis,
xldlas allows you to graph variables. All of xldlas's graphical
output is actually performed by gnuplot, an application which is
included in all major Linux distributions. Two graphing commands
are implemented: Plot and Histogram. The former lets you create
line and scatter plots, while the latter generates a histogram
describing a variable's distribution. Both sorts of graphs can be
titled and labeled, and they can be saved in any format supported
by whatever version of gnuplot is installed on your system. In
addition, you can set point and line styles, and the Histogram
routine includes an optional feature which will superimpose a
normal distribution with the same mean and variance as the data
being graphed.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>xldlas</b></span> also provides fairly
powerful logging facilities. The Log command allows you to echo all
of xldlas's output to an ASCII file. A more powerful tool is the
TeXLog command, which allows you to create a PlainTeX format log
file with a user-supplied name. All subsequent output, such as
regression tables, is written to this file in TeX format. Under
xldlas's default configuration, all saved graphs are also included
as Encapsulated PostScript insertions. This makes writing
statistical papers (such as homework assignments) quite fast and
efficient, since much of the time-consuming TeX markup is done
automatically.</p><p>Finally, all xldlas commands are documented on-line in the
Help menu. There are also a number of on-line tutorials, which many
users of xldlas have found to be a very useful introduction.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bc5580.0x1cbdef8"></a>Coming Soon</h2></div></div><p>There are currently plans afoot to add a number of features
to xldlas. Regressions using Probit and Logit models are high on
the to-do list. A set of statistical filters is also likely to be
available before long, making it possible to easily detrend data,
remove outliers, and so on. HTML format log files will soon be
supported. Another important task is to expand the documentation in
the source code so it can be more easily modified by people other
than the original author.</p><p>Like almost all freely distributable software, xldlas
development is driven by user feedback. If there are features you
want to see, send me some e-mail, preferably with a reference to
the algorithm you would like to see implemented.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bc5580.0x1cbe058"></a>Resources</h2></div></div><p>The best way to get a copy of xldlas is from its homepage at
<a href="http://www.a42.com/~thor/xldlas" target="_self">www.a42.com/~thor/xldlas</a>.
If you only have FTP access to the Internet, you can get it from
<a href="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu" target="_self">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/</a>
(in pub/Linux/X11/xapps/math/). Both full source and a Linux ELF
executable are included in the distribution, which is named
xldlas-X.Y-srcbin.tgz, where X.Y is the version number (0.40 at the
time of writing).</p><p>To run the included executable or compile from the source
code, you'll need to have the XForms library installed on your
system. For more information about XForms, visit the XForms
homepage at
<a href="http://bragg.phys.uwm.edu/xforms" target="_self">bragg.phys.uwm.edu/xforms</a>.
Although designed to run under Linux, xldlas will apparently
compile under almost all flavours of Unix for which the Xforms
library exists, although a little tinkering with the Makefile is
sometimes necessary. Make sure you look at the README file included
in every distribution to get the latest news on compiling and
running xldlas.</p><p>gnuplot is available at
<a href="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/math/gplotbin.tgz" target="_self">sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/math/gplotbin.tgz</a>.
It is also included in most Linux distributions.</p><p>For full functionality, xldlas also requires you to have a
fairly complete TeX package installed on your machine. NTeX and
teTeX are commonly used under Linux, and are available at
<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/tex" target="_self">http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/tex/</a>.</p></div></div>
