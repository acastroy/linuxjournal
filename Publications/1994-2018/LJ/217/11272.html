Dave continues improving the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Words With Friends</em></span> script.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcb7580.0xdaf408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
My last article ended by wrapping up the word finder utility for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Words With Friends</em></span>, a fun and complicated project that ended up requiring
about 65 lines of Bourne Shell. That's not too long, but for a shell script,
actually, it is rather long, and it was one of the scripts we've written
that most begged to be coded in Perl or another more string-friendly language.
Still, we persevered, right?
</p><p>
In this article, let's wrap things up by looking at word values based
on the individual letter values in both <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Words With Friends</em></span>.
</p><p>
To start, here's how the point chart looks for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Words With
Friends</em></span>:

 
<pre     class="programlisting">
A=1   D=2   G=3   J=10   M=4   P=4   S=1   V=5   Y=3
B=4   E=1   H=3   K=5    N=2   Q=10  T=1   W=4   Z=10
C=4   F=4   I=1   L=2    O=1   R=1   U=2   X=8
</pre>
</p><p> 
This contrasts with the somewhat lower point value of letters in the game
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span>:


<pre     class="programlisting"> 
A=1   D=2   G=2   J=8   M=3   P=3   S=1   V=4   Y=4
B=3   E=1   H=4   K=5   N=1   Q=10  T=1   W=4   Z=10
C=3   F=4   I=1   L=1   O=1   R=1   U=1   X=8
</pre>
</p><p>
If you look closely, you'll see that just about every word is going to be
worth less in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span> than in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Words With
Friends</em></span>&mdash;interesting. I always assumed
that the two used the same basic letter-for-letter point values, so that
calculating point values in one game taught you how to calculate points for
the other&mdash;not so!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcb7580.0xdafb40"></a>
Calculating Point Values</h2></div></div><p>
There are a lot of ways to translate a sequence of letters into their
individual point values and calculate the sum of those values. Indeed, an
array comes to mind immediately, but the problem is that you still have to
write the code to step through the individual letters, and if you're doing
that, why not use sed for the letter &rarr; numeric value substitution
instead?
</p><p>
It turns out that's a fast and elegant solution, and I've coded it also to 
compare easily what letters have a given point value in wwf
(aka <span   class="emphasis"><em>Words With Friends</em></span>) and s (aka
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span>).
</p><p>
Here's how I coded the one-point letters in each:

<pre     class="programlisting">
wwf1="s/[asetior]/ 1 /g
s1="s/[asentiloru]/ 1 /g"; 
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can clearly see, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span> has a lot more one-point letters than
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Words With Friends</em></span> does. Again, I had no idea until I started this analysis.
</p><p>
With sed expressions coded up this way, it's easy to turn a word
like &ldquo;cat&rdquo; into &ldquo;4  1  1&rdquo;. Here's the full set of substitutions:

<pre     class="programlisting">
wwf1="s/[asetior]/ 1 /g"
wwf2="s/[dlnu]/ 2 /g"
wwf3="s/[ghy]/ 3 /g"
wwf4="s/[bcfmpw]/ 4 /g"
wwf5="s/[kv]/ 5 /g"
wwf8="s/[x]/ 8 /g"
wwf10="s/[jqz]/ 10 /g"

s1="s/[asentiloru]/ 1 /g"
s2="s/[d]/ 2 /g"
s3="s/[mpbc]/ 3 /g"
s4="s/[vyhwf]/ 4 /g"
s5="s/[k]/ 5 /g"
s8="s/[jx]/ 8 /g"
s10="s/[qz]/ 10 /g"
</pre>
</p><p>
Quite honestly, entering all that data is the hardest part of creating the word-point-value
script. It's tedious work, so you'll be smart to copy
and paste.
</p><p>
Now that you have a bunch of numeric values,
however, what do you do with them?
It turns out that's easy too:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sed 's/  / + /g'
</pre>
</p><p>
Think about the original substitution, and you'll see what I'm doing:
the first letter substitutes to &lt;space&gt; letter &lt;space&gt;, as does every
subsequent letter. Therefore, individual spaces denote the very beginning and
end of the word, while double spaces are only between digits. Replace those
double spaces with a +, and that sequence of digits translates into a
simple mathematical formula:

<pre     class="programlisting">
4 + 1 + 1
</pre>
</p><p>
To solve simple math, you can use <tt  >$(( ))</tt> as a shell notation, or you can call
the built-in function <tt  >expr</tt>&mdash;same basic result.
</p><p>
Before we get there, however, here's how I'll use that sequence of
sed substitutions in the script:


<pre     class="programlisting">
wwfexpr=$(echo $1 | sed "$wwf1;$wwf2;$wwf3;$wwf4;$wwf5;$wwf8;$wwf10" 
 &#8618;| sed 's// + /g')

sexpr=$(echo $1 | sed "$s1;$s2;$s3;$s4;$s5;$s8;$s10" | 
 &#8618;sed 's/  / + /g')
</pre>
</p><p>
You can see I've tucked the double-space-to-plus-sign substitution into
the same subshell invocation too&mdash;short and neat. In fact, those two lines are
the heart of the script. There's only one line left actually, and it both
calculates the actual values and shows the result:


<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "\"$1\" has a base point value of $(expr $wwfexpr) in WwF 
 &#8618;and $(expr $sexpr) in Scrabble"
</pre>
</p><p>
This is what I really like about programming with the power of the entire
Linux shell at your fingertips: this script that calculates point values for a
given word in both <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Words With
Friends</em></span> is actually only three
lines long, if you don't count the variables we set up at the beginning.
</p><p>
Now, let's run it to see what kind of values we see:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh wordvalue.sh calculate
"calculate" has a base point value of 18 in WwF and 13 in Scrabble
</pre>
</p><p>
Let me explain the <tt  >sh script.sh</tt> notation briefly, in case you
haven't see this approach before. A classic way that hackers Trojan Horse
a Linux or UNIX system is to drop a shell script like vi or
ls into somewhere like the /tmp directory. It's not a problem, unless your
PATH looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
.:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcb7580.0xdb0958"></a></h2></div></div><p>
in which case you can unwittingly run the invasive script and possibly create
a setuid root copy of the shell for the bad guys to exploit at their later
convenience. Security's a bit far afield for this particular column, but
suffice it to say that for security reasons, I never have &ldquo;.&rdquo; in my PATH.
</p><p>
Therefore, I could use <tt  >./script</tt> to invoke the script in my current
directory if it's marked as executable, but since I have so many scripts
lying around, I find it even safer to not mark them as executable until
I'm 100% sure they're done and tested. Instead, <tt  >sh
script</tt>
works just as well, although it spawns a subshell for execution.
</p><p>
Now you know. And, here are more examples:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh wordvalue.sh word
"word" has a base point value of 8 in WwF and 8 in Scrabble

$ sh wordvalue.sh linux
"linux" has a base point value of 15 in WwF and 12 in Scrabble

$ sh wordvalue.sh journal
"journal" has a base point value of 19 in WwF and 14 in Scrabble
</pre>
</p><p>
At this point, I'll leave it as an exercise for you, the reader, to figure
out how to graft this functionality onto the script we wrote in the previous
few articles that calculated possible words from a set of letters.
</p><p>
The additional bonus task is to be able to analyze the board so you can figure
out how to cover DL, TL, DW and TL squares, as available (that stands for
double letter, triple letter, double word and triple word, in case you're
not a hard-core word-gamer). Beware though, it's considerably more
difficult, because now you have to figure out how to enter the current state of
the board&mdash;definitely extra credit!
