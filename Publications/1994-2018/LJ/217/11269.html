<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #217, May 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>GNU General Public License</b></span> is pretty powerful. By ensuring that
derivative works can be distributed only if the source code is made
available as well under the same license, it ensures that a piece of
free software can't suddenly &ldquo;go dark&rdquo;, if a given person or company
wants to fork the code and release a proprietary version.
</p><p>
Since the very early days of Linux, however, there has been a nagging
question surrounding this issue: are <span   class="bold"><b>kernel
drivers</b></span> actually
derivative works? If the courts ever decide they are, the vast
and growing array of binary-only kernel drivers suddenly will find
themselves faced with a tough question: either release their
source code under the GPL or stop distributing the driver to
anyone.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> has said that he's fine
with binary drivers, but other
folks have said that it's really the license itself, and not his
opinion, that determines whether someone has violated the GPL. Thus far,
the courts have not ruled either way, so the question remains open.
</p><p>
From a practical standpoint, however, it's possible for binary drivers
to insinuate themselves so deeply into the kernel that they really do
constitute a derived work, anyway you slice it. So, a long time ago,
the kernel started using <span   class="bold"><b>EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL</b></span> to mark kernel interfaces
that truly were considered intrinsic, and that could be used only to
code that identified itself as being released under a GPL-compatible
license. So, for a long time now, binary-only drivers have had
access only to a controlled subset of kernel interfaces that prevent them
from essentially forking the kernel into a proprietary version.
</p><p>
That's the history, and it's a balance that seems to work well enough
for everyone. But recently, <span   class="bold"><b>Christoph
Hellwig</b></span> submitted a patch, which
was accepted, that dramatically changed that balance in the <span   class="bold"><b>Virtual
Filesystem</b></span> (VFS). As <span   class="bold"><b>Anton
Altaparmakov</b></span> said in response to the patch,
Christoph's code would make it virtually impossible for binary-only
drivers to read or write files the way they always had before. The
drivers would have to re-implement from scratch all the VFS interfaces
for reading and writing.
</p><p>
Ultimately, it turned out that Christoph had not intended to add these
restrictions, but the discussion revealed a fairly big gap between the
opinions and preferences of various kernel developers. <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span>, for
example, indicated (as nearly as I can make out) that he opposed all
binary-only drivers and did not think they were legal, regardless of
the existence of EXPORT_SYMBOLS_GPL. He said he'd never given
permission for them to use any of his code. And, since his code is
virtually everywhere in the kernel, that's saying a lot.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alexander Viro</b></span>, who's been the VFS maintainer for many years, said
that all interfaces exported from the VFS should be made available to
binary-only drivers, unless there was &ldquo;a damn good reason&rdquo; to
restrict them. He also said that such restrictions would need to be
clearly documented.

If you are disgruntled by the new interfaces provided by recent
distribution releases, namely GNOME 3 and Unity, you might want to take a
look at Cinnamon. With its traditional feel and extreme theme-ability,
Cinnamon is a desktop interface bound to spice up anyone's computer. The
general feel is that of GNOME 2, or perhaps XFCE, but its polished look and
downloadable themes make it truly exciting to behold.

</p></div></div><p>
Development has revolved around Linux Mint, but Cinnamon also can be
installed on Ubuntu for those so inclined. If you've never seen it in
action, be sure to give it a whirl: <a href="http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com" target="_self">cinnamon.linuxmint.com</a>.

Some say Windows has all the best games, and in the case of Xonotic, it's
partially true. Xonotic is a free, open-source, first-person shooter
designed by the developers of Nexuiz. Xonotic uses a highly modified version
of the Quake engine called DarkPlaces. Sporting both single and
multiplayer modes, the fast-paced action and detailed maps will please even
the fussiest gamers. Download the Windows version of Xonotic from the
Web site: <a href="http://www.xonotic.org" target="_self">www.xonotic.org</a>.

<h2 class="title">Programming for Scientists</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #217, May 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
My last several articles have covered different software
packages that are useful to scientists trying to do computational
science. I tried to explore as broad a spectrum of subjects as I
could in those pieces, and I even covered some basic programming constructs like MPI or
scipy. But, I always have been limited by the amount of space a venue
like this allows. All I can do is provide a taste of what is out
there and hope that readers take it away and learn more on
their own. Also, in many cases people find themselves doing research in
areas that never have been done by anyone else before. This means
there will not be an appropriate software package, and researchers will need to
write their own software from scratch. 
</p><p>
One
major problem for computational science researchers is that
they simply do not have the time to attend normal classes over the span
of a term or two in order to learn the skills they need to do their
work. They need to be able to jump-start their research and essentially
go from zero to 100mph in no time flat. Part of my day job is to help
them do this. I provide crash courses in most of the subjects that they
may need. But, what can they do when they leave and try to apply
this information several days or weeks later? Enter the Software
Carpentry site (<a href="http://software-carpentry.org" target="_self">software-carpentry.org</a>), a resource
that should be on every researcher's bookmark list. I have
no association with the author and maintainer of the site. I'm just glad
to have a high-quality source of information to which I can point my users.
</p><p>
The first level of resources available is a set of self-paced on-line
workshops. These workshops are distributed under a creative commons
license, specifically the Creative Commons Attribution License. This
means you are free to use the material and remix it, as long as
you properly attribute the author. These workshops cover a vast number
of subjects and are available as both PDF and PowerPoint
files. For some of the workshops, video screencasts
even are available, so it's almost like having an instructor right there with
you. Each topic is broken down into smaller sections to make digesting
them easier. Additionally, exercises are available so you can review the
material. 
</p><p>
Many new researchers, graduate students
and post-docs have had little or no experience in computational science
at all. Many never even have seen any type of UNIX environment. This is
quite a stumbling block, as most high-performance computing centers that
I know of run Linux. So you probably will want to start with the workshop
The Shell. This workshop is broken down into the following
sections:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Introduction
</p></li><li><p>
Files and Directories
</p></li><li><p>
Creating and Deleting
</p></li><li><p>
Pipes and Filters
</p></li><li><p>
Permissions
</p></li><li><p>
Finding Things
</p></li><li><p>
Job Control
</p></li><li><p>
Variables
</p></li><li><p>
Secure Shell (SSH)
</p></li></ul></div><p>
This list of items should make new Linux users comfortable
enough to use the command line effectively. Because most HPC clusters are
accessed through an SSH connection, being comfortable on the command
line is essential. 
</p><p>
The next workshop you should look at is the Version
Control workshop. To my mind, this is one of the most important subjects
to learn for computational science research. This is a field where code 
constantly is being toyed with, by many different people over long periods
of time. It is of utmost importance to be able to back out experimental
changes in the code when something breaks or when you've gone
down the wrong path in your research. But, almost no one uses a version
control system. So, just to make my life easier as a research consultant,
please go ahead and check out this particular workshop.
It will be one of the most useful workshops you could attend.
</p><p>
As far as programming workshops go, the only language explicitly covered is
Python. The Python
workshop is relatively complete, and it covers the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Basics: running Python, variables, comparison operators.
</p></li><li><p>
Control Flow: while loops and conditionals.
</p></li><li><p>
Lists: creating, deleting and maintaining lists, for loops.
</p></li><li><p>
Input and Output: dealing with files.
</p></li><li><p>
Strings: handling strings, formatting, concatenation.
</p></li><li><p>
Aliasing: what it is and how it can cause problems.
</p></li><li><p>
Functions: what they are and how to use them effectively.
</p></li><li><p>
First-Class Functions: binding functions to variables, passing functions to
functions.
</p></li><li><p>
Libraries: importing modules, dealing with namespaces.
</p></li><li><p>
Tuples: creating and indexing, unpacking lists.
</p></li><li><p>
Slicing: slicing vs. indexing, and so on.
</p></li><li><p>
Text: how lines and characters are stored, dealing with unicode.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Python is relatively similar to other languages (like C), so you should
be able to apply what you learn here to those other languages with just
minor syntax translations. Also, Python is growing in popularity in
scientific programming circles due to its clean formatting rules and the
relative ease of incorporating external high-performance libraries written
in C or FORTRAN. In this sense, you almost can consider Python to be a
glue language, but it has quite a lot of capability available directly
through external libraries like numpy and scipy. You could do worse as a
computational scientist than learn Python. With its growing popularity,
there is also a greater chance that the specific problem area you're
researching already has tools or libraries available.
</p><p>
Once you have at least one language under your belt, it is time to learn
more of the details involved in programming itself. These workshops cover
the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Program Design: goes through a simple example of designing, debugging and
improving a program.
</p></li><li><p>
Testing: how you should test your software, handle exceptions and do unit
tests.
</p></li><li><p>
Make: how to use rules, patterns and macros to build your software.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
These topics cover a lot of the extra items you need to know in order
to program effectively, but they aren't strictly programming proper. That
topic is
covered by the following workshops:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Sets and Dictionaries: using associative data structures to represent data
that doesn't really fit into a list.
</p></li><li><p>
Regular Expressions: how to use regular expressions for pattern matching.
</p></li><li><p>
Databases: an introduction to SQL.
</p></li><li><p>
Data Management: an introduction to managing your data.
</p></li><li><p>
Matrix Programming: using numpy to handle numerical processing.
</p></li><li><p>
Multimedia Programming: programming using sound, pictures and other media
files.
</p></li><li><p>
Spreadsheets: using spreadsheets for analysis and visualization.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
With these workshops, you will learn many of the programming
elements and structures that will be of use to you in scientific
programming. After this, you should have covered enough, hopefully,
to be able to program a solution to the problem you are
studying. Again, all of these workshops include exercises, so 
you actually can try applying what you have learned.
I'm a firm believer that you don't learn anything
until you actually try to use it.
</p><p>
In-person workshops and boot camps also are available. Because
all of the material is available for free reuse, you simply can use
the workshop materials to put on your own workshop or boot camp.
The team behind Software Carpentry also is available to do in-person
boot camps. You can contact them through the Web site to make arrangements.
These boot camps are two- or three-day crash courses to cover the bulk
of the material, and they're always being offered at different
places around the globe&mdash;follow the blog to see
when one is being offered in your neck of the woods. If you do decide
to run your own, the team at Software Carpentry is happy to help
out and spread the word through its network. A forum
is available at the Web site for each of the workshop topics where you can
discuss the material with other attendees or other presenters.
</p><p>
Finally, I suggest that you actually subscribe to the
blog RSS feed. New workshops always are being added, and new boot camps
always are being planned. Watching the RSS feed will keep you informed
about these additions. As always, feel free to contact me if you have
anything specific you'd like to see covered here. Hopefully, I've been
able to plant the seed and give you ideas on how you can pick up the
skills you need.
