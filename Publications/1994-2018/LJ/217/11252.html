In spite of being a multiparadigm programming language, Lua provides a
nontrivial object-oriented programming model that may prove cumbersome to
programmers who want to apply OO software engineering practices to
development. This article presents a reusable mechanism through which
you can implement an object-oriented model using Lua's built-in constructs.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14e5580.0x15dd1f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Lua is a dynamic scripting language and has been developed at the PUC-Rio
University in Brazil since 1993. In its current 5.2 version, it
is lightweight and portable, and it has become very successful for both
open-source and commercial software projects, particularly in the field
of video games, where it is being used by companies like EA.
</p><p>
Lua also is becoming increasingly important for mobile device software
development and recently has been chosen by Wikipedia as its new scripting
language. I first became interested in Lua when I learned about how
easy it was to embed into C and C++ applications.
</p><p>
But, enough introduction&mdash;let's start creating some objects!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14e5580.0x15dd4b8"></a>
A Basic Object-Oriented Model</h2></div></div><p>
The first thing you should know is that Lua does not provide any
special constructs for declaring object classes. Indeed, all Lua knows
about are &ldquo;tables&rdquo;. Programming in Lua in an object-oriented fashion
boils down to being able to create an object model on top of Lua tables.
</p><p>
Fear not, however. Here I walk-though a model that can be used
(hopefully) for all your object-oriented needs. This model is based
on the one presented in the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming in Lua</em></span>, which I
highly recommend reading.
</p><p>
Let's start by supposing you want to create a mechanism through which
you can represent 2-D Point objects. In Lua, you can define a
generic Point table that looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Point = {x=0, y=0}
</pre>
</p><p>
Think of this as the template for your point objects. All of your points will
have x and y attributes.
</p><p>
Now, you can't do much with this construct as it stands. You need a way to
&ldquo;create&rdquo; new points. In order to do so, let's add to the Point table a
new attribute called, well, &ldquo;new&rdquo;. It will allow you to create new points:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Point.new = function(o)
    if o then
        return o
    else
        return {x=0, y=0}
    end
end
</pre>
</p><p>
The reason to add a branch in the code is that in case the caller
doesn't supply any parameters, the function will just create a default
point set to (0,0).
</p><p>
That wasn't very difficult! You now have a Constructor and can create
new points like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
p1 = Point.new({x=10, y=10})
</pre>
</p><p>
However, for people coming from other programming languages, this
function declaration might look a little strange and even may be hard to
remember. Fortunately, Lua provides some syntactic sugar that allows you
to rewrite this constructor in a more familiar fashion.
</p><p>
Take a look at the following snippet. The semantic value is exactly the
same as before:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function Point.new(self, o)
        local p = o or {x=0, y=0}
        return p
end
</pre>
</p><p>
It's much nicer, right? Let's stick to this style for the rest of this article.
</p><p>
And, that's it as far as creating or &ldquo;instantiating&rdquo; new
points goes. Now,
let's add a method to the Point class. Let's provide the points
the ability to pretty-print themselves to the standard output.
</p><p>
First, give Points a <tt  >print</tt> method:


<pre     class="programlisting">
function Point.print(p)
    print("("..p.x..","..p.y..")")
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, you can print points like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
p1 = Point.new({x=10, y=10})
Point.print(p1) --prints: "(10,10)"
</pre>
</p><p>
In a similar fashion, you can add a range of methods like translating,
scaling and rotating points. The only limitation is that you always
will have to call these methods as shown above: prefixing every invocation
with the class name and explicitly supplying the point on which to
operate.
</p><p>
It is natural to ask, &ldquo;can you improve this syntax?&rdquo; It turns
out, you can
by using Lua's colon operator (:).
</p><p>
The colon operator can be used in a statement like
<tt  >p1:print()</tt>,
and it will be expanded to <tt  >p1.print(p1)</tt>
automatically. Just like there are two semantically equivalent options for
adding methods to your classes, these two expressions are semantically
equivalent as well.
</p><p>
Now, consider this: if you could have Lua associate whatever
name is <span   class="emphasis"><em>at the left</em></span> of the colon operator to the object
class, you would be able to simulate message passing to objects. This
would allow using the following syntax with your objects:

<pre     class="programlisting">
p1:print() --prints p1
p2:print() --prints p2
</pre>
</p><p>
Thus far, however, you can't associate p1 and p2 with
Point. When <tt  >p1:print()</tt> is expanded to
<tt  >p1.print(p1)</tt>, the Lua interpreter will print an error message
stating that <tt  >"p1" has no attribute called "print"</tt>.
</p><p>
Who knows about &ldquo;print&rdquo;? Well, &ldquo;Point&rdquo; does. What
you need to do is tell
Lua that when it fails to find a given attribute or method in
&ldquo;p1&rdquo;,
it has to continue searching in &ldquo;Point&rdquo;. This association can be declared
using the concept of metatables.
</p><p>
Assuming &ldquo;p1&rdquo; is a point like before, this snippet will set everything
up so the Lua interpreter continues searching for attributes and methods
missing in &ldquo;p1&rdquo; in your Point class:


<pre     class="programlisting">
setmetatable(p1, Point)
Point.__index = Point
</pre>
</p><p>
After this little change, the following code will start to behave the
way you want:

<pre     class="programlisting">
p1.print(p1) --prints p1
</pre>
</p><p>
But more important, its semantically equivalent sibling will work too:

<pre     class="programlisting">
p1:print() --prints p1
</pre>
</p><p>
What sadly will not work is trying to do this on &ldquo;p2&rdquo;, because
&ldquo;p2&rdquo; has no metatable. Therefore, you must set its metatable to
&ldquo;Point&rdquo; as well. And, not just for &ldquo;p2&rdquo;, but also for every single
Point instance you create.
</p><p>
Although manually setting the metatable for every Point
instance definitely is an option, it might prove to be cumbersome and
error-prone. Furthermore, because this is an operation that has to be
performed <span   class="emphasis"><em>on every</em></span> point instance, why not do it in the
Point constructor? Let's do that.
</p><p>
This is the updated Point constructor. It first will check whether an object
has been supplied and will create a default one if it hasn't. Then, it will set the
object's metatable to be Point, making unrecognized messages be
rerouted to the Point class for every point created:


<pre     class="programlisting">
function Point.new(self, o)
    local p = o or {x=0, y=0}
    setmetatable(p, self)
    self.__index = self
    return p
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Note: I am passing the metatable as the first argument of the Constructor
(and calling it &ldquo;self&rdquo;). This not only will allow you to create new points
using the colon operator (as shown in the next example), but it also lets you
do some advanced object-oriented tricks that I'll discuss later.
</p><p>
With this updated constructor, the following is now valid:

<pre     class="programlisting">
p1 = Point:new({x=10, y=10})
p2 = Point:new({x=20, y=20})
</pre>
</p><p>
That's it as far as declaring, instantiating and using point objects
goes. Try running this example using the Lua interpreter, and make sure
you understand the concepts. I will build upon them in the next sections
to show how to implement Polymorphism and Inheritance.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14e5580.0x15dec70"></a>
Polymorphism</h2></div></div><p>
In the previous section, I described a mechanism by which you can model a
class &ldquo;Point&rdquo; by means of Lua tables. In this section, let's 
build on the previous concepts to support Polymorphism with your objects.
</p><p>
Polymorphism is one of the most powerful concepts in object-oriented
programming. It allows the programmer to change the behavior
of a system dynamically based on the type of the objects to which you send
your messages.
</p><p>
Although Lua doesn't provide an out-of-the-box object model, it turns
out that implementing Polymorphism in Lua is very easy due to the dynamic
nature of the language.
</p><p>
Suppose you have a global function &ldquo;printpoints()&rdquo;, which receives a
list of points and has them printed to the standard output. Furthermore,
suppose you had two different point types in your system: Point, which
models 2-D points just like you have been using so far, and Point3D,
a new class that represents 3-D points that live in 3-D space.
</p><p>
For this example, let's imagine that the
&ldquo;printpoints()&rdquo; function
will be required to handle mixed lists of 2-D and 3-D objects.
</p><p>
Well, if you can have both point types present in a single list and
you have a statically typed programming background, you already
might be thinking that you need both points to ascribe to a common interface
that allows them to be printed. The term &ldquo;IPrintable&rdquo; may even come
to mind.
</p><p>
Indeed, what you require is for both points to share a set of messages
they respond to. In other words, you need both types to agree to a contract
that &ldquo;certifies&rdquo; that they can be &ldquo;printed&rdquo;.
</p><p>
In statically typed programming languages, this contract can be expressed
by means of Interfaces. In Lua, however, such a construct is not necessary,
as you can use the dynamic foundation of the language to ask, at runtime,
whether an object responds to any given message.
</p><p>
In this case, the message would be &ldquo;print&rdquo;.
</p><p>
This concept of objects conforming to a common Interface that is not
declared anywhere explicitly is known as an Implicit Protocol. Both
point types will abide to the Implicit Protocol of knowing how to
print themselves.
</p><p>
Let's see how this &ldquo;printpoints()&rdquo; function could go:


<pre     class="programlisting">
function printpoints(points)
    for _, p in ipairs(points) do
        if p.print then
            p:print()
        end
    end
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, you receive the list of points to print, and independently of what
the list contains, iterate over its elements. For each element,
you ask whether it responds to the message &ldquo;print&rdquo;. If it does,
you send it the &ldquo;print&rdquo; message.
</p><p>
Let's use the interactive interpreter to see how this function behaves
when handling a list consisting of two 2-D Points and one 3-D Point:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ lua
Lua 5.1.4  Copyright (C) 1994-2008 Lua.org, PUC-Rio
&gt; require "point"
&gt; points = { Point:new({x=10,y=10}), Point:new({x=20,y=20}), 
 &#8618;Point3D:new({x=30,y=30,z=1}) }


--The "points" list contains 2D and 3D points.


&gt; printpoints(points)
(10,10)
(20,20)
(30,30,1) -- This is a 3D point!
</pre>
</p><p>
Note how the points in the list were able to respond to the
&ldquo;print&rdquo;
message, each using its corresponding behavior, meaning 2-D points printed
their (x,y) pairs, whereas the single 3-D point correctly printed its
(x,y,z) tuple. This is, effectively, Polymorphism in Lua.
</p><p>
If you are feeling uneasy about the concept of Interfaces,
remember that the true meaning of Polymorphism is not in implementing
Interfaces, but rather in having objects dynamically respond to the
messages received according to their type.
Dynamically typed programming languages are, therefore, an ideal fit
for Polymorphism.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14e5580.0x15d6000"></a>
Inheritance</h2></div></div><p>
The last major concept common to object-oriented programming that I'm
going to tackle here is Inheritance. How can you add an Inheritance mechanism
to the object-oriented model I've been discussing?
</p><p>
Unlike Polymorphism, when modeling type Inheritance, it is not enough
to have the objects ascribe to the same Implicit Protocol and rely
on the dynamism of Lua. In order to implement Inheritance, you need to
describe a relationship effectively between the types of the base data
type (the base class) and the derived data type (the derived class).
</p><p>
What you need to do is be able to &ldquo;extend&rdquo; an object type with a
newer, &ldquo;more concrete&rdquo; type that adds specific logic.
</p><p>
The way to achieve this using Lua might seem strange at first, but
if you bear with me, you will see it naturally matches the concepts 
used here thus far.
</p><p>
To continue with this example, let's add to the system the ability to
represent 3-D points in homogeneous coordinates. In homogeneous coordinates,
each 3-D point is represented using four values (x,y,z,w).
</p><p>
When converting from Cartesian coordinates to homogeneous coordinates, you
just need to set the w value to 1. To convert from homogeneous coordinates
back to Cartesian coordinates, you need to divide all components of
the point by the w value, therefore taking (x,y,z) back to Cartesian
coordinates.
</p><p>
The 3-D point (1,1,1) in homogeneous coordinates would be (1,1,1,1),
as well as (2,2,2,2), (3,3,3,3) and so on. If you are not
convinced, try dividing by w in each case and see what happens.
</p><p>
Points in 4-D homogeneous coordinates <span   class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> 3-D points, meaning,
Points in homogeneous coordinates (PointH) have an &ldquo;is a&rdquo; relationship
with class Point3D. This is an Inheritance relationship you can represent
in the object model.
</p><p>
Assuming class Point3D exists and is similar to Point, you start by
stating that PointH (4-D homogeneous coordinate points) are 3-D Points:

<pre     class="programlisting">
PointH = Point3D:new({x=0, y=0, z=0, w=1})
</pre>
</p><p>
What I did here, conceptually, was to declare PointH to be a new class
that &ldquo;Inherits&rdquo; all the behavior from Point3D. In particular,
its metatable will point to Point3D.
</p><p>
What's interesting is the fact that when you create a new PointH
instance called &ldquo;ph&rdquo;, by using the PointH:new() method,
Point3D's
constructor will be called, but with the &ldquo;self&rdquo; object pointing to
(table) PointH instead. Therefore, the &ldquo;ph&rdquo; instance will have its
metatable pointing to PointH and not Point3D.
</p><p>
This achieves a &ldquo;chain&rdquo; of metatables. PointH
instances will have PointH as their metatable, whereas class PointH
will have Point3D as its metatable. This chain of metatables allows the
Lua interpreter to conduct the following searches automatically when a
message is sent to a PointH instance:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
1) First, search in the instance itself.
</p></li><li><p>
1.1) If the method is present, call it. 
</p></li><li><p>
1.2) Otherwise, search in the PointH class.
</p></li><li><p>
1.2.1) If the method is present, call it.
</p></li><li><p>
1.2.2) Otherwise, search Point3D class.
</p></li><li><p>
1.2.2.1) If present, call it.
</p></li><li><p>
1.2.2.2) Otherwise, fail.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In this example, if you send &ldquo;ph&rdquo; a &ldquo;print&rdquo;
message, &ldquo;ph&rdquo;
doesn't know &ldquo;print&rdquo;, so it delegates the message to its metatable:
PointH. PointH doesn't know how to &ldquo;print&rdquo; either, so it delegates the
message to its own metatable: Point3D. Point3D knows how to
&ldquo;print&rdquo;,
so its method is used.
</p><p>
Now, suppose you taught PointH how to interpret the &ldquo;print&rdquo; message
by defining the function <tt  >PointH.print(p)</tt>. In that
case,
PointH's print would have been used instead of continuing the search
in Point3D.
</p><p>
What this means is that your Inheritance model effectively supports
&ldquo;overriding&rdquo; a base class' methods.
</p><p>
This is how PointH's complete implementation would look:


<pre     class="programlisting">
PointH = Point3D:new({x=0, y=0, z=0, w=1})

function PointH.print(p)
    print("("..p.x..","..p.y..","..p.z..","..p.w..")")
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, Point3D's print is overridden with PointH's, meaning that when
calling print on a PointH instance, the w value will be printed along the
(x,y,z) tuple.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This article described one of the mechanisms through
which object-oriented programming can be implemented in the Lua
programming language. Polymorphism and Inheritance, two of the main
pillars upon which object-oriented programming is based, was discussed
as well.
</p><p>
Hopefully, you will be able to use these ideas, or build on top of them,
to bring your own object-oriented software designs to Lua.
