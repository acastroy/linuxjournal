Want your site to look good, even though you're not a designer? Try a design
framework.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1644580.0x173c358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For as long as I can remember, I've known how to use a pencil. I
can write with it, and I even can draw with it&mdash;although in my case,
saying I can draw is something of a sad exaggeration. I might
know how to use a pencil and thoroughly understand its technology, but
that technical knowledge doesn't mean I can draw something
aesthetically pleasing.
</p><p>
I mention this because I always think of my poor drawing abilities
when I work with CSS. I understand the technology and have used it
for many years. I'm comfortable working with and modifying
stylesheets, and using complex selectors. And yet, any Web
application that I create on my own looks ugly. Despite all of my
technical knowledge of CSS, I'm generally unable to make a nicer, more
pleasing design.
</p><p>
Fortunately for people like me, a new type of framework exists
to help with such problems. Just as server-side frameworks like
Ruby on Rails and Django make it easy to create Web applications,
and client-side frameworks like Backbone.js and Knockout.js make it
easy to create in-browser applications, design frameworks make it easy
to decorate and design your applications.
</p><p>
Now, when I first heard about design frameworks (sometimes known as
CSS frameworks), I wondered how they could possibly help. After
all, I already know CSS; what could they contribute? The answer is: a
great deal. By embracing a design framework, you gain a number of CSS
classes and IDs that make it very easy to lay out your page. By
choosing the right classes, you can make a site look more than
reasonable, even if you have my graphic design skills. Using a
design framework means that even if you don't have any design skills,
you can make a site that looks fairly pleasing. If you do have
design skills, the framework will allow you to do more with less
effort.
</p><p>
In this article, I describe some of the leading design frameworks,
leading up to the latest and most interesting one, Twitter's
Bootstrap. In my next article, I'll look more closely at Bootstrap and why
it has taken the world by storm.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1644580.0x173c6c8"></a>
Blueprint</h2></div></div><p>
The first design framework I'm aware of was (and is) Blueprint.
The idea behind Blueprint is pretty simple. You download and refer to
Blueprint's three CSS files: one for the screen, one for print and
one with special definitions for Internet Explorer:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/blueprint/screen.css" 
 &#8618;type="text/css" media="screen, projection"&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/blueprint/print.css" 
 &#8618;type="text/css" media="print"&gt;
&lt;!--[if lt IE 8]&gt;
   &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/blueprint/ie.css" 
 &#8618;type="text/css" media="screen, projection"&gt;
&lt;![endif]--&gt;`
</pre>
</p><p>
By including these stylesheets, Blueprint resets the CSS values for
the user's browser, removing any defaults that might have been set
elsewhere for margins, padding and borders.
</p><p>
Blueprint also resets the defaults for typography, ensuring that your
headline and paragraph tags look better, and more consistent, than the
defaults defined by each browser. Again, even without any additional
effort on your part, Blueprint ensures that your typography is a
bit more in line with established principles of design. As the
Blueprint Web site says, these principles predated the Web and 
still are relevant in our electronic age.
</p><p>
The real magic of Blueprint, however, is in its layout. Blueprint
offers a &ldquo;grid layout&rdquo;, which in practical terms means it provides
you with CSS classes that let you indicate how wide a particular
element should be, from one column across to 24 columns across. Do you
want to display two divs, side by side, with the left-hand div taking
up two-thirds of the space? No problem&mdash;just define them as follows:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;div class="container"&gt;
    &lt;div class="span-16"&gt;This is the left-hand div&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="span-8 last"&gt;This is the right-hand div&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
By using these CSS classes, the divs automatically will take up the
right amount of space on a user's screen. Moreover, because the content is inside
a
div named &ldquo;container&rdquo;, the width of the screen
(and of the divs) will adjust automatically according to the width of
the user's browser window.
</p><p>
Before Blueprint, Web designers would do all this work themselves,
implementing and re-implementing such columnar layouts on their own,
specifically for each site. The advantage of Blueprint's 24-column
grid is that you have enormous flexibility in the layout of your
pages, letting each element extend across however many columns you
think are appropriate. So long as the span-* classes add up to 24,
and the final element on each row has the &ldquo;last&rdquo; class, the layout
will look pretty good. This is far better, in every way, from what
many people would do to ensure a certain layout, namely the use of
tables. Tables are great, but not for laying out a page. I can't tell
you how many times I've seen tables triple-nested inside other
tables, just to get the layout to work appropriately.
</p><p>
Another advantage of Blueprint is that it has tried and tested these
CSS definitions on a variety of browsers. You no longer need to worry
about whether things will work on Chrome, Firefox, IE and Safari,
because Blueprint has taken care of that for you. The special IE-only
CSS file ensures that Internet Explorer also will work correctly, even
if your users are running an old version.
</p><p>
Of course, because Blueprint is a bunch of CSS files, you always
can change it to suit your needs. And indeed, much of the (extensive)
Blueprint documentation describes how you can customize not only the
layouts, but also the CSS itself.
</p><p>
The biggest criticism of Blueprint is that its class names violate the
spirit of CSS. Sure, you can have classes named &ldquo;span-5&rdquo; and
&ldquo;span-10&rdquo; to indicate that you want text to extend across five or ten
columns of your 24-column layout. But, wasn't CSS supposed to free you
from such calculations, allowing you to think more in terms of semantic
names? My response is that, yes, this is a good point, but
Blueprint's layouts are so useful and so easy to understand,
it's unhelpful to focus on the original intent of CSS's designers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1644580.0x173ce58"></a>
Sass, SCSS and Compass</h2></div></div><p>
Another problem with Blueprint isn't inherent to Blueprint itself,
but rather to the technology on which it's based. CSS is a very clever
technical standard, but it has been demonstrably difficult for people
to learn and understand, and also for many designers to use. True,
some people are able to make beautiful, clever designs with CSS, and I
don't mean to diminish their capabilities in any way. But, CSS has a
number of deficiencies, many of which I hadn't thought about until I
discovered Sass a few years ago.
</p><p>
Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a CSS preprocessor. That
is, it is a file format that you compile, with the output of the
compilation being a CSS file. Sass has a large number of advantages
over straight CSS, starting with the fact that you can set variables.
This is a tremendous thing when you're creating a site that should
have a consistent color scheme. You can set the colors in one place
and then use them in many different places.
</p><p>
Sass also lets you nest CSS definitions, such that if you have several
elements that share definitions, you no longer have to repeat those
similarities in different places, but can take advantage of something
akin to variable scoping in a programming language. Nesting also
means that complex selectors become easier both to write and to read,
since they break the path down into digestible parts.
</p><p>
Sass also offers a type of function or macro definition, known as a
&ldquo;mixin&rdquo;, allowing you to keep your CSS DRY (&ldquo;Don't Repeat
Yourself&rdquo;).
This means you can define a CSS rule in one place and then
include it in multiple other places.
</p><p>
Now, Sass has been around for several years, and it has worked well
during that time. It originally was written by developer Hampton
Catlin (who also developed the Haml template format), but has since
been taken over by Nathan Weizenbaum and Chris Eppstein. The original
Sass syntax resembled Python in some ways, in that trailing semicolons
were removed and indentation was a mandatory part of the syntax.
That is, the indentation of your declaration, or even of the definition
of your mixin, mandated indentation, and the level of indentation
reflected the scope within which your definitions would take effect.
For example, here is a simple set of definitions in Sass, taken from
the sass-lang.com home page:

<pre     class="programlisting">
table.hl
  margin: 2em 0
  td.ln
    text-align: right

li
  font:
    family: serif
    weight: bold
    size: 1.2em
</pre>
</p><p>
You then would run a Sass compiler over the Sass file, producing a CSS
file that could be interpreted by a Web browser.
</p><p>
This syntax still exists, and if you prefer it, Sass happily
will work with you. However, the preferred syntax is now known as SCSS,
and it is a superset of the existing CSS syntax. My impression is that
the syntax changed partly because the differences between CSS and Sass
were too great for many people, and the mandatory indentation caused
problems for a number of users. Thus, the Sass shown above can
be expressed in SCSS as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
table.hl {
  margin: 2em 0;
  td.ln {
    text-align: right;
  }
}

li {
  font: {
    family: serif;
    weight: bold;
    size: 1.2em;
  }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, the syntax is quite similar to that of standard CSS,
making it easier for people to make the transition from CSS.
</p><p>
The entire Sass framework, including both syntaxes, is mainly
implemented in Ruby and is in widespread use among Ruby-language Web
developers. However, you aren't required to use Ruby as
your Web development language. Many people use this system, compiling
it from Sass/SCSS into CSS without knowing or caring that they're
using Ruby. That said, the Ruby on Rails framework has adopted SCSS
as a standard part of its infrastructure, such that anyone using Rails
likely will know and use it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1644580.0x173d380"></a>
Compass</h2></div></div><p>
Neither Sass nor SCSS is a design framework; they are stylesheet
languages and are meant to simplify your CSS development. But the
authors of Sass have created the Compass design framework (which they
call a &ldquo;CSS authoring framework&rdquo;), which predefines a large number of
classes and mixins for use in your own projects. So if you want to
have rounded corners or standardized fonts or a set palate of
colors, Compass will make it easy for you to do so.
</p><p>
Moreover, Compass comes with a Blueprint compatibility mode. This
means if you have a site that already is working with Blueprint,
you can (mostly) just replace the Blueprint CSS files with the Compass
CSS files, and you're done.
</p><p>
Compass is both clever and powerful, and I'm very impressed with what
I have seen and how it works. Nevertheless, I have been disappointed
with its level of documentation, especially on issues having to do
with the Blueprint compatibility. Yes, I was able to find all the
answers I wanted in the end, and the e-mail list is particularly
active and helpful. But I was surprised by how much I had to turn back
to the Blueprint documentation to understand what the Compass
compatibility mode was doing, rather than just being able to access
the documentation directly.
</p><p>
None of this takes away from the power Compass provides and the
flexibility it offers users. If you're interested in working
with Compass, and not just with Sass/SCSS, either of the books
that I mention in the Resources section probably will be useful, given
the detail in which they describe the Compass framework.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1644580.0x173d640"></a>
LESS</h2></div></div><p>
LESS is another stylesheet language, and it's very similar in many
ways to the SCSS syntax from the Sass framework. Indeed, my
impression is that SCSS and LESS learned from and influenced one
another, although it's not clear to me just who influenced whom, and
at what times. The bottom line is that if you're comfortable with
SCSS, you're likely to be comfortable with LESS, and vice versa.
There are some differences in the syntax, but they're pretty minor.
</p><p>
One difference between LESS and Sass is that LESS files can be
compiled in a number of different ways. They can be turned into CSS
using a compiler&mdash;originally written in Ruby, but currently written
in JavaScript&mdash;running on the developer's computer, either before or
during the deployment process. However, because the implementation is
in JavaScript, another option is available. You can download the LESS
stylesheet, as is, into your browser and then use a JavaScript
library to translate it into CSS on the fly. For example:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;link rel="stylesheet/less" type="text/css" href="styles.less"&gt;
&lt;script src="less.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
For performance reasons, it's best to compile the LESS file into CSS
beforehand. However, this is useful when the compiler is not
available, if you want to generate stylesheets dynamically, and also
during development.
</p><p>
Why would you prefer LESS over SCSS, or vice versa? I honestly cannot
give a compelling reason for one over the other. They're so similar
and have such advantages over plain-vanilla CSS that it doesn't matter which you
choose, so long as you go with one of them. Before Bootstrap, I would have put my
money on SCSS becoming the de facto standard, but Bootstrap might have given LESS a
new lease on life, and might even help it overtake SCSS.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1644580.0x173d900"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Given the similarity between LESS and SCSS, I'm not surprised a
framework emerged that is based on LESS. But the framework that was
created (Bootstrap, written by two engineers at Twitter and
released under the Apache license) has turned out to be a huge hit
among developers and designers alike. Bootstrap not only includes
Blueprint's grid, but also a large number of other conveniences and
stylings that make it easy to have good-looking navigation bars,
tables, forms and even widgets for dynamic, client-side applications.
Bootstrap even is capable of modifying the size and shape of menus
depending on screen size, making it a &ldquo;reactive&rdquo; framework appropriate
for mobile devices as much as desktop computers.
</p><p>
Some people even are getting tired of Twitter Bootstrap, because it
has become so popular and makes it easy to create designs that look
like many other Bootstrap sites. But for someone like me, who just
wants to get a simple site up and running, and for it to be relatively
nice-looking, I've found Bootstrap to be a huge help.
</p><p>
In my next article, I'll actually look at Bootstrap&mdash;what it provides, how
to install and use it, and even how to use it along with Ruby on
Rails, which (as I mentioned above) comes with support for SCSS, rather
than LESS. Regardless of which of these systems and frameworks you
use though, I strongly encourage you to try them and incorporate
them into your own work. An experienced designer presumably will know
how to integrate these technologies, while design-challenged
programmers will welcome the chance to create a nice-looking site on their own.
