    dtree is a utility that will display a directory hierarchy
    or tree.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fdf580.0x20d73a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>While Linux comes with hundreds of
utilities, something you got used to on another system always seems
to be missing. One program in this category is something that will
display a directory hierarchy or tree.
</p><p>While some file managers that run under X-Windows will do
this sort of task, it is sometimes very handy to have a
command-line version. While not Linux-specific, the dtree utility
is such a program.</p><p>I will first explain how to use dtree, then explain how it
works. If you invoke it by just entering its name it will display
the directory hierarchy starting at the current directory. If you
invoke it with an argument, that argument is used as the starting
directory. For example, if you enter <b  >dtree
/home/fyl/Cool</b>, a tree of directories under
/home/fyl/Cool will be displayed.</p><p>dtree is written in the finest old-time Unix tradition using
common utilities with a short shell script to glue them together.
Here is the program:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
: dtree
: dtree
# print a hierarchy tree starting at
# specified directory (. default)
(cd ${1-.}; pwd)
find ${1-.} -type d -print | sort -f |
sed -e "s,^${1-.},," -e "/^$/d" -e \
"s,[^/]*/\([^/]*\)$,\`-----\1," -e "s,[^/]*/,|      ,g"
</pre><p>Before you panic, remember, it is only four lines plus
comments. It can't be that hard to figure out. The first step is to
run the program and produce some sample output. If you don't have a
computer at hand-or want to see what it does before you become a
believer-I have included what I get by running it in my current
directory (/home/fyl/<i  >LJ</i>).</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/home/fyl/<i  >LJ</i>

</pre><p>The first line in the output is the name of the directory
dtree was run on. This line was produced by the line that begins
with <b  >(cd</b>. Breaking this line down:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >${1-.}</b> means use the first
argument from the command line <b  >($1)</b> if it is
available, otherwise use <b  >.</b> which is a synonym
for the current directory. Thus, the cd command either changes to
the directory specified on the line that invoked dtree or to the
current directory (a virtual no-op).</p></li><li><p><b  >pwd</b> then displays the path name
of the current directory.</p></li><li><p>The parentheses around the whole line force the
command to be run in a subshell. This means the cd command is local
to this line and subsequent commands will be executed from what was
the current directory when dtree was initially invoked.</p></li><li><p>The <b  >find</b> command prints out all
files whose type is d (for directory). The same directory reference
is used as in cd.</p></li><li><p>The output of find is piped into
<b  >find</b> and the <b  >-f</b> option tells
sort to fold upper and lower case names together.</p></li><li><p>The tricky formatting of the tree is done by
<b  >sed</b> in four steps. Each step is set off by
<b  >-e</b>. This is how you tell sed a program
follows.</p></li><li><p>The first expression,
<b  >s,^${1-.},,"</b> is a substitute command which tells
sed to replace everything between the first two delimiters (a comma
is used as the delimiter) with everything between the second. The
initial <b  >^</b> causes the match to be performed only
at the beginning of the line. The expression that follows is,
again, the starting directory reference, and the string between the
second pair of delimiters is null. Thus, the requested directory
name from the beginning of the output of sort is trimmed.</p></li><li><p>The second expression, <b  >/^$/d</b>
tells sed to delete all blank lines (lines with nothing between the
beginning and the end).</p></li><li><p>The third expression is probably the trickiest. It
used the ability to remember a string within a regular expression
and then use it later. The expression
<b  >s,[^/]*/\([^/]*\)$,\`-----\1,</b> tells sed to
replace the last two strings separated by a slash (/) with a
backquote, five dashes and the last string (following the final
slash).</p></li><li><p>Lastly, the final expression,
<b  >-e "s,[^/]*/,|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,g"</b>
tells sed to replace every occurrence of strings that do not contain a
slash but are followed by a slash, with a pipe (|) and six
spaces.</p></li></ul></div><p>Unless you are familiar with regular expressions you probably
didn't follow all that. But you probably learned something and you
can easily use dtree without having to understand how it
works.</p></div></div>
