    Michael leaves, and where <i  >LJ</i> goes from here.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ebd580.0x1fb5190"></a></h2></div></div><p>Here comes one of those good news/bad
news stories. To get the bad news over with, this is Michael K.
Johnson's last issue as editor. To quote Michael, &ldquo;I want to be a
geek.&rdquo; To explain, for the past two years Michael has been working
at home as Editor of <i  >LJ</i> and he wants to work
with other &ldquo;geeks&rdquo; (I used to call them computer professionals,
but I don't want to detract from what he said). He was offered an
opportunity at Red Hat Software that features the environment he
wants without having to relocate.
</p><p>He will be missed. When Michael climbed on board,
<i  >LJ</i> was in transition from being run out of my
basement to becoming a product of SSC. In the past two years
<i  >Linux Journal</i> has become the single largest
product within SSC. We now have two full-time staff members in
publishing, one and one-half advertising representatives, and over
a dozen other employees who are shared with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>WEBsmith</em></span>, our sister publication, and the
other SSC publishing work.</p><p>Michael gets much of the credit for acquiring quality
technical material for <i  >LJ</i> and turning us into
a respected publication in the Linux community as a whole. And
Michael has always been willing to write something to &ldquo;fill in the
gaps&rdquo; when an author hasn't come through. We wish him well in his
work with the other geeks and encourage him to send an article our
way whenever he has a chance.</p><p>Now, the good news. In these two and one-half years
<i  >Linux Journal</i> has existed, Linux itself has
grown up. There are vendors around the world offering products for
Linux. There are Unix software vendors porting their applications
to Linux. There are hardware vendors seriously addressing the Linux
market.</p><p>You don't have to take my word for it&mdash;just look at our
advertisers. And watch for the &ldquo;Cool, it works with Linux&rdquo; logo
in ads in other publications. Linux is being taken seriously in
lots of places. Two years ago, would you have expected:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Apple to offer a version of Linux</p></li><li><p>Digital to support Linux on the Alpha</p></li><li><p>WordPerfect to be available for Linux</p></li></ul></div><p>This means Linux has a life of its own. While I feel
<i  >Linux Journal</i> gets some credit for spreading
the word, Linux has taken off because it is a viable alternative to
other operating systems.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ebd580.0x1fb5920"></a>Who Is the Staff?</h2></div></div><p>When Michael made his decision to leave
<i  >LJ</i> in April, we started looking for a
replacement. In the interim, we pooled our internal expertise.
Unlike most magazines, we actually use what we publish a magazine
about. On our staff we have well over 50 years of combined time
working with Unix or Linux.</p><p>There are two recent changes that bolster the
<i  >LJ</i> staff. First, Gena Shurtleff moved into the
position of Assistant to the Publisher. Gena was previously in
charge of Accounts Payable for SSC. The transition brings an
experienced SSC employee onto the <i  >LJ</i>
staff.</p><p>SSC also recently hired Marjorie Richardson. She is in the
position of Technical Editor and will be shared between
<i  >LJ</i> and other SSC projects. Margie's 6 years of
experience with Unix, both as a programmer and technical writer,
gives our internal experience a huge boost.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ebd580.0x1fb5c38"></a>Enter Roger Scrafford</h2></div></div><p>As well as our staff, much of our copy editing is done by
consultants. Gary Moore and Roger Scrafford have been working with
us for some time and bring their experience, as well as their Linux
expertise, to the table.</p><p>In our shopping for someone to fill the Managing Editor
position we looked at all the people who had been working with us.
Of those people, Roger Scrafford looked like he had the necessary
skills and, as it turned out, the interest in this position. I have
been talking to Roger about the position for the last month and, as
this issue goes to press, he has accepted the job. You will see a
quick introduction written by Roger in these pages and you will be
hearing a lot more from him starting with the next issue.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ebd580.0x1fb5d98"></a>Where Do We Go from Here?</h2></div></div><p><i  >Linux Journal</i> has always tried to
address the needs of the newcomer as well as the experienced user.
We recently added our <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Means Business</em></span>
column to show where Linux is being used to offer real commercial
solutions.</p><p>But we need to do more. We need to do a better job of helping
the newcomer get seriously involved, we need to show more of the
business solutions that are springing up, and we need to help Linux
move into new areas (like embedded applications).</p><p>To do this, we need a combination of a good staff, interested
readers, committed advertisers and authors excited by the topics
about which they write. It is my job to come up with the good staff
and, if I do say so myself, I think I have. We see more and more
committed advertisers every day, many of whom have the same sort of
enthusiasm the developers have. New advertisers mean we can expand
the size of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, and thus, offer
more editorial information. Support those guys&mdash;they are who make
all this possible.</p><p>To have interested readers we need to have interesting things
to say. That is where you come in. If you are just a reader, tell
us what you want to see in <i  >LJ</i>.  We listen.
Tell us about your interests.</p><p>If you have an interesting story to tell, want to describe a
program you wrote or just think you might want to write something
at some time in the future, let us know you are around and what you
are thinking about. You can request an Author's Guide and &ldquo;hot
list&rdquo; or send in a query by sending e-mail to
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>
