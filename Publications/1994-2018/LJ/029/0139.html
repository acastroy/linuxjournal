    Back in March, we compared the available Linux
    distributions. This review draws heavily from that work and
    offers updated infromations on what is available on PC
    platforms.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b5f580.0x1c57500"></a></h2></div></div><p>A Linux distribution is a package that
contains the Linux kernel, application and utility programs and an
installation method. While all distributions are based on the same
or similar kernels and many of the same utilities, each
distribution has something different to offer the consumer. Thus,
while there really isn't a <span   class="emphasis"><em>best</em></span> distribution,
there are distributions that are better for different users. In
this article, we attempt to offer you enough information so you can
select the distribution best for you.
</p><p>Is this a cop-out? Are we shirking our duty? It has become
clear to us that it would be hard for <i  >Linux Journal</i> to rank the distributions; our staff members
have different personal favorite distributions and defend their
choices rationally&mdash;occasionally even argumentatively. At
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, we use Linux
extensively&mdash;nearly exclusively&mdash;and we still don't agree which
distribution is the best. We have different priorities, skills, and
expectations, and we believe this is true of our readers as
well.</p><p>Before we get too deep into this review, note that as this is
being written, the Linux 2.0 kernel is about to be released (the
scheduled release date is June 9, 1996). This new kernel offers
some major enhancements. (See the interview with Linus in this
issue for details.) The distributions will surely be updated to
take advantage of this new kernel. Look for an updated review in
the special Buyer's Guide issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, which will be out in February 1997.</p><p>Some of the descriptive text that originally appeared in the
March 1996 review article has been removed. If you want to look at
all the information presented in that issue, it is available on our
web site,
<a href="../023/toc023.html" target="_self">/issue/0023</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b5f580.0x1c578c8"></a>Version Numbers</h2></div></div><p>Many new Linux users confuse the version of the
<span   class="bold"><b>distribution</b></span> they are using with
the version number of the <span   class="bold"><b>kernel</b></span>.
As mentioned above, the Linux kernel is just one of the many pieces
of software needed to create an entire distribution. Each
distribution uses version numbers of its own to keep track of the
state of the entire distribution, which has more to do with the
collection of programs than with the particular kernel involved.
Indeed, many distributions have included two or more different
kernel versions in one version of the distribution.</p><p>However, it's worth understanding the version numbers used
for the Linux kernel itself, since the kernel is a key part of any
Linux distribution. Kernel version numbers come in three parts: the
<span   class="bold"><b>major</b></span> version number, the
<span   class="bold"><b>minor</b></span> version number, and the
<span   class="bold"><b>patch-level</b></span>. The Linux kernel is
being constantly developed by a large team of developers, and while
they add new features, they occasionally introduce new bugs. To
keep this from causing a problem for Linux users, the developers
periodically dedicate several months to fixing bugs and creating a
very robust, stable kernel. When this is done, a
<span   class="bold"><b>stable version</b></span> is released with an
<span   class="bold"><b>even</b></span>-numbered minor version
number. The developers then begin adding features (and temporarily
breaking things sometimes) to <span   class="bold"><b>development
versions</b></span> with
<span   class="bold"><b>odd</b></span>-numbered minor version
numbers.</p><p>Unless you want to live on the &ldquo;bleeding edge&rdquo; of Linux
development, you will probably want to stick with the latest stable
kernel version. As of this writing, the latest stable kernel
version is 2.0, but most distributions are based on the previous
production kernel, which is 1.2.13.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b5f580.0x1c57d98"></a>Value Added</h2></div></div><p>Several vendors are adding value to existing distributions in
various ways. For example, <a href="0139s2.html" target="_self">Caldera is
adding commercial components to Red Hat Commercial Linux to create
their Caldera Network Desktop</a>. Trans-Ameritech bases their
value-added work on Slackware, trying to make it easier to
install.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b5f580.0x1c57ef8"></a>Binary File Formats</h2></div></div><p>One of the most common sources of confusion in the Linux
world today involves binary file formats (See
<a href="0139s1.html" target="_self">What is a binary file format?</a>).
Most vendors have now switched from the older &ldquo;a.out&rdquo; binary file
format to the new &ldquo;ELF&rdquo; binary file format.</p><p>ELF is the binary file format used by Unix System V Release
4, but that doesn't mean a Linux binary in the ELF file format is
compatible with SVR4, nor does it mean that SVR4 binaries can run
on Linux. The capability for Linux to run
<span   class="bold"><b>some</b></span> SVR3 and SVR4 binaries is
provided by the <span   class="bold"><b>BCS2</b></span> compatibility
package, which most distributions include.</p><p>One of ELF's features is extensibility; with ELF, it is
possible for developers to add features that weren't thought of
when the format was first designed. For instance, one Linux
developer has noted that he could add icons to ELF executables
without breaking any software. Icons weren't considered when ELF
was developed, but the format is extensible enough that they can be
easily added.</p><p>But perhaps you don't care if you can add an icon to your ELF
binary, or even if anyone else can. What does ELF do for you?
Fundamentally, it makes life much easier for Linux developers. It
also has a few esoteric features which make it practical to support
some software under Linux that was previously impractical to
support. So it gives you more and better software available for
Linux.</p><p>What do we mean by
<span   class="bold"><b>based</b></span>?</p><p>ELF-based means the entire distribution or, at least, almost
the entire distribution, consists of ELF binaries. Binaries in the
a.out format are not provided with the system, or if they are
provided, they either aren't part of the &ldquo;core&rdquo; of the system or
they are not available in ELF format.</p><p>By contrast, &ldquo;supports ELF&rdquo; means that, while the
distribution is partially or completely built of binaries in the
a.out format, the ELF <span   class="bold"><b>programming
libraries</b></span> are included so that ELF binaries will also
run.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b5f580.0x1c583c8"></a>Media</h2></div></div><p>Many distributions are available solely on CD-ROM. There are
several reasons for this:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>So much software is available for Linux that it is
impractical to provide it all on floppies.</p></li><li><p>It is much easier to install software from CD-ROM
than to change floppies once a minute.</p></li><li><p>An inexpensive CD-ROM drive costs the same or less
than the stack of floppies needed to install a complete Linux
distribution.</p></li></ul></div><p>However, some distributions (including Debian, Red Hat, and
Slackware) are available via FTP over the Internet in a form
designed to fit on floppies.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b5f580.0x1c58790"></a>Copyright Considerations</h2></div></div><p>Many distributions are freely available over the Internet,
although only some are actively distributed in a way that makes it
feasible to install them directly from the Internet. You should be
aware that while distributors can restrict you from running
commercial software components on more than one machine, they
cannot restrict you from installing the base Linux software on
multiple machines. A Linux distribution packaged in a form which
cannot be installed without installing proprietary software under
copyright licensing terms more strict than the GNU General Public
License is probably in violation of copyright law.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b5f580.0x1c58898"></a>Missing Bugs</h2></div></div><p>One thing you may notice missing from this overview is a list
of bugs in each distribution. In general, we assume some noticeable
bugs are inevitable in software that is evolving as quickly as
Linux, and vendors will be responsive in tracking and eradicating
bugs. If they aren't, word of mouth between users will be more
effective than any sort of complaining on our part. We also want to
avoid showing any bias, and if we start listing bugs we find, we
will either show bias or appear to show bias simply by the
&ldquo;choice&rdquo; of bugs we publish.</p><p>Since we can't do a fair comparison of the number and
severity of bugs between distributions, we have tried to note only
bugs that involved completely missing functionality or which were
difficult to work around and hard for the user to avoid.</p><p>If working around simple bugs is a problem for you, we urge
you to purchase a distribution from a vendor who offers technical
support for the installation process. By providing installation
technical support, these vendors not only help you with the
problems, but force on themselves a vested interest in fixing those
bugs. Providing support is expensive, and solving the same problem
over and over again is a waste of their time and money.</p><p>At the same time, if you buy installation technical support,
understand that you aren't buying a lifetime warranty for every
part of the system. None of the vendors here provide that as part
of their base product. You can buy very comprehensive support
packages from several vendors if you need them.

boxed set of 1 CD-ROM, two floppy disks and a user's guide. Caldera
Linux is based on Red Hat Linux 2.1 but uses its own installation
system and desktop environment, and it includes many applications
which can be found nowhere else.</p><p>Installation is very simple. The two disks included are a
standard boot disk and a PCMCIA boot disk; you'll only need one of
them. Simply boot your machine with the boot disk, insert the
CD-ROM, and follow the messages which prompt you along the way. The
initial package selection is somewhat granular, providing three
predefined choices: Minimal Installation, Default Caldera, and
Maximal Installation. But you can always fine- tune package
selection later from within the Desktop. The installation process
covers all the bases&mdash;from network configuration to X setup to
LILO&mdash;and then requires you to make a rescue disk for safety.
Overall, installing Caldera is very easy, and I encountered no
unexpected surprises.</p><p>Once the system is installed, you can reboot into Caldera
Linux, which will prompt you to set a root password and create a
user account. After this, you can log in as your new user and start
the desktop by typing <b  >startx</b>. The Caldera
desktop looks somewhat MS Windows-like. It has a toolbar at the top
which includes options such as File, Window and Help; it supports
quick-keys, like ALT+F3 and ALT+F4; has &ldquo;program groups&rdquo; and
makes extensive use of icons. It has several additional features
not found in Windows, however. It supports virtual screens; uses an
additional, customizable icon toolbar (similar to fvwm's GoodStuff
module); and of course, since it's on top of X, has all the power
and configuration capabilities (not to mention stability) of
X.</p><p>Since Caldera is based on Red Hat Linux, all the standard Red
Hat system administration tools are available within Caldera, and
all packages are stored in RPM format.</p><p>Caldera includes Motif, Accelerated-X (by X-Inside),
Netscape, the CRiSP Lite editor, Caldera's Font Server and a full
NetWare client (Netware 3.x and 4). Caldera has also ported to
Linux WordPerfect 6.0, among other applications. These applications
are generally available separately as an &ldquo;add-on&rdquo; package, to
Caldera users.</p><p>Caldera is a very professional Linux distribution which I
would recommend to anyone who wants a user-friendly,
commercial-grade Linux system or to anyone who wishes to integrate
a full-featured Linux network server into a NetWare
environment.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b5f580.0x2051068"></a>Debian .93R6</h2></div></div><p>The only distribution in this lineup which is not developed
on a commercial basis, Debian has been a long time in the making.
Unlike all the other Linux distributions, Debian is put together by
a team of volunteers. While a few people are in charge of a very
small core of the distribution, almost all the decisions are made
by consensus, and nearly all the packages are developed
independently by members of a large development team.</p><p>By following a strict set of rules and using the most
powerful packaging technology currently available for Linux, this
team has achieved a remarkably coherent Linux package. Debian has
complete <span   class="emphasis"><em>dependencies</em></span>: when you install one
package, it checks to see if other needed packages are also
installed. It also checks version numbers if requested; package
<span   class="bold"><b>A</b></span> can insist that package
<span   class="bold"><b>B</b></span> be installed and be version
<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> or greater. This makes upgrading any package
nearly foolproof. The installation program will also suggest
installing other packages the user will likely want if he or she
installs package <span   class="bold"><b>A</b></span>.</p><p>Debian installs the entire &ldquo;base&rdquo; system from floppy (three
floppies) and then you reboot into the base system with enough
software to install any other packages you like. This way, all the
base system has to support is floppies and hard drives. During the
initial &ldquo;base&rdquo; installation, you can choose which kernel modules
to load, determining what hardware is supported. Debian is highly
modularized.</p><p>All of Debian's packaging tools run in text mode, so X is not
required to use any of Debian's sophisticated upgrade capabilities.
The package tools are also very fast.</p><p>Debian is currently being transformed from an a.out-based
distribution with optional ELF support to a fully ELF-based
distribution. [At print time, Debian 1.1 beta was stable; this
version will be reviewed in a future issue&mdash;Ed.]</p><p>Debian's home page can be found on the Web at
<a href="http://www.debian.org" target="_self">www.debian.org</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b5f580.0x2051538"></a>Craftworks Linux 2.0</h2></div></div><p>Craftworks Linux, by Craftwork Solutions, Ltd., comes as a
boxed set of one CD-ROM, one floppy disk and a 70 page manual. The
single floppy disk is both a boot and a root disk, alleviating the
need to make any floppies. Craftworks will install from FTP,
CD-ROM, NFS, locally mounted media, tape and PPP. It supports
PCMCIA Ethernet and CD-ROM for installation, as well. It has no MS
Windows or UMSDOS installation capability and requires 8MB of RAM
to install. The distribution is all ELF.</p><p>Craftworks' installation utility prompts you for your desired
partitioning scheme (and shows you a recommendation), the
installation method you want, and what kind of system you want to
install. It has three precompiled kernels to choose from: Cyclom,
SoundBlaster and Generic. All are ELF 1.2.8 with AIC7xxx and iBCS
patches and have support for the ftape loadable module (QIC-40,
QIC-80, QIC-3010 and QIC-3020). The SoundBlaster kernel supports
the SB-Pro and SB-16. The Cyclom kernel supports the Cyclades
Cyclom-Y driver.</p><p>Craftworks Linux uses a unique system for installing
packages, called Component Replacement And Fabrication Technology
(CRAFT). This system does extensive package dependency checking to
assure that all required packages for a particular utility are
installed and that packages are intact according to files present,
size and checksum. The software itself comes bundled in something
called Component Catalogs, grouping together related packages.
Installing additional software is as easy as mounting the media
containing the catalog and running sysadm (see below) to select and
install it.</p><p>There are three predefined choices for package installation:
Minimal, Developer and X Workstation. The fourth choice is Custom,
and it allows you to pick which packages you want to install ahead
of time. Selecting any of the first three choices will begin
installation without further delay. Package selection comes into
play only if you choose Custom. The package selection is
considerably more granular than many other big Linux distributions,
giving you somewhat less control over exactly what is installed and
what is not. Once the installation process has begun, it requires
no further attendance. Take a little break, and when you return,
simply reboot and your system will come up ready to run. If you
chose to use LILO, it will have checked your partition table, and
any partitions labeled DOS will have been automatically added to
the LILO configuration for you to choose from at boot time.</p><p>Craftworks Linux comes with sysadm, a graphical utility that,
from a single screen, lets you control many aspects of your system,
including modification of user/group information, security
settings, tcp wrappers, IP firewalling, X Windows setup, system
backup, and much more. The fact that sysadm is a text-based
application is another useful characteristic, as it will run in low
memory and on inferior or unconfigured display cards, in addition
to X Windows.</p><p>I was impressed to find that Craftworks comes with shadow
password support, IP firewalling, FlexFax and APSfilter. I was even
more impressed to find that it also comes with DOSemu, the MS-DOS
emulator, and BRU, a high-quality commercial backup and restore
utility, correctly configured.</p><p>Craftworks Linux is FSSTND-compliant and everything is laid
out logically and sensibly. I could easily find all of the
configuration files I needed, which were all stubbed out to provide
consistent and useful examples.</p><p>I think Craftwork Solutions' distribution would be an
excellent choice for serious Linux users who want a complete
distribution that comes mostly preconfigured and is easy to use and
maintain.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b5f580.0x20518a8"></a>Linux-FT 1.2</h2></div></div><p>Linux-FT, by LaserMoon, Ltd., comes as a boxed set of two
manuals (a 64 page installation and configuration guide and a Motif
2.0 user's guide) and 6 CD-ROMs. It is based on kernel 1.2.13 and
uses the ELF file format. It is the only Linux distribution that is
POSIX.1 certified.</p><p>Installation of FT is fairly easy. There are far fewer
questions to answer compared to many other distributions. X
configuration (which is an optional part of the installation
process) is also very simple. Linux-FT does not use LILO but,
instead, uses its own multi-OS boot loader. One of the most
interesting and different things about Linux-FT's installation
process is that hardly anything gets copied to your hard drive.
Instead, the bare minimal operating system is installed, and from
that point, the system reboots with the runtime CD mounted and uses
what LaserMoon calls <span   class="emphasis"><em>copy-cache</em></span> technology.
With copy-cache, whenever you attempt to run an application or use
a package that does not exist on your hard drive, the software is
transparently installed to it (from the mounted run-time CD-ROM)
for later use.</p><p>Of course, once you have Linux-FT installed and X up and
running, you can begin tweaking your system with &ldquo;xadmin&rdquo;, a very
powerful, extremely thorough X-based configuration and maintenance
utility, to explicitly install packages or remove them permanently,
just as with any other distribution.</p><p>I was highly impressed to find that xadmin can do anything
from configuring user and group settings to formatting a floppy
disk. Some of its maintenance capabilities include NFS, lpd,
PPP/SLIP, file system and hardware setup, package maintenance,
process table and much more. It makes administration a whole lot
easier and less time consuming.</p><p>Linux-FT includes mwm, the Motif Window Manager, and has
shadow passwords, IP firewalling, iBCS and quota support in the
kernel. There is a massive amount of software included with FT:
three archive CD-ROMs which contain a lot of Linux-related material
from all over the Internet, and also a separate web server CD,
which contains both the Apache and NCSA web servers, as well as a
good deal of HTML- and CGI-related material and web browsers.
Additionally, there is the run-time CD, which has the Linux-FT
distribution on it, and a source code CD which contains&mdash;you
guessed it&mdash;source for many of the applications and tools on the
run-time CD. If there's anything in the Linux-FT distribution that
isn't in abundance, it would have to be printed documentation.
There's not a lot of &ldquo;how-to&rdquo; information.</p><p>In my opinion, Linux-FT would be a good choice for any hard
core professional Unix/Linux user who wants a powerful, flexible
and high-quality, professional, POSIX.1-certified, UNIX-like work
environment.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b5f580.0x2051bc0"></a>Linux Universe</h2></div></div><p>Linux Universe is a book, with simple installation and
configuration instructions and a small reference section, which
includes a Linux distribution on CD-ROM. It's translated from
German, and the distribution on it is also apparently translated
from German, since some of the comments in the scripts are still in
German.</p><p>Like Linux-FT, Linux Universe has its own full-screen boot
loader (instead of using LILO) and is intended to be run with a
minimum of software loaded onto the hard disk, caching other
programs to the disk as they are needed.</p><p>Linux Universe is intended to be a companion to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux&mdash;Unleashing the Workstation in your PC,</em></span>
by the same authors. You can purchase Linux Universe alone or in a
kit with its companion volume. If you are not already familiar with
Linux (or at least Unix), you will want to purchase the whole kit,
not just Linux Universe.</p><p>The graphical configuration utility is simple to use and
seems to work well. It works quickly and intelligently. When
filling out the networking configuration, for example, it guesses
most of the information once you type in the IP address.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b5f580.0x2051e28"></a>Red Hat Linux 3.0.3</h2></div></div><p>Red Hat Linux 3.0.3 comes as a boxed set of two CD-ROMs and a
190 page user's guide. There is no included boot disk, so you must
make your own using another operating system, such as DOS or Unix.
Red Hat comes with over 70 possible boot disk images to choose
from, depending on your hardware configuration. Red Hat can be
installed from floppy, FTP, CD-ROM, NFS, or pre-mounted local file
system and will install from PCMCIA ethernet and CD-ROM. There is
no support for a UMSDOS installation, although you can install from
within DOS. Installing from DOS does not require making a boot
floppy.</p><p>This latest version of Red Hat can be run live from CD-ROM
(disc 2) and can also be installed in 4MB of RAM, provided you can
perform a CD-ROM installation. All other types of installation
require 8MB of RAM and two additional floppies, which are used to
load the RAM disk.</p><p>Red Hat 3.0.3 is completely ELF and uses Linux kernel 1.2.13,
libc-5.2.18, gcc-2.7.2 and XFree86-3.1.2. It also comes with the
Metro Link X-server. Red Hat uses its own package format, Red Hat
Package Manager (RPM). RPM packages are easy to install, upgrade
and remove, and have built-in dependency checking. The RPM package
format is primarily used for Red Hat Linux, but the software itself
has the Gnu Public License and is and is gaining acceptance among
commercial Linux developers.</p><p>The installation procedure is pretty well polished and feels
nearly foolproof. You may choose to do either a text-based or an
X-based installation. For both options, the script is intelligent
and will correctly identify most of your hardware, providing you
with sane defaults for most of the options, including what packages
to install, LILO configuration and network setup. The X
configuration is very simple and reliable; any novice with a video
card manual should be able to get X Windows fired up in no time.
This version of Red Hat by far surpasses the previous in package
selection. There is simply a staggering number of packages
available to install from the Red Hat CD. There are now almost 30
main groups of packages, each subdivided into several smaller
groups, which are in turn subdivided into individual packages. This
makes for an extremely fine degree of control over exactly what is
and is not installed on your system. I noticed one possibly big
drawback to such a high degree of control: there does not seem to
be a foolproof package dependency system to ensure that required
packages are installed, e.g., runtime libraries or the Tcl/TK
utilities needed to run Red Hat's own setup and configuration
tools. The installation program does have all required packages
highlighted by default, so, as a word of advice to the novice,
don't unselect anything unless you're sure about it.</p><p>Once the package installation is complete, you may reboot
into your freshly installed Linux system. All system configuration
and setup is done through the Control Panel. The Control Panel is
an X Windows-based program that makes configuration of functions
like network setup, account administration, and package management
a simple process. Red Hat discourages you from indulging in the
time-honored trade of editing configuration files by hand, and,
instead, urges you to use Control Panel. The drawback to such an
easy-to-use, point-and-click interface is if you can't run X, you
can't run Control Panel.</p><p>I think Red Hat would be a good choice for anyone who is
looking for a big distribution that is both fun to use and easy to
maintain and install. Red Hat would be good, in particular, for a

only on the Internet (and on archive CDs provided by various
vendors) into an <span   class="emphasis"><em>official</em></span> distribution from
Walnut Creek CD-ROM. Much like Red Hat, Slackware is still
available on those archive CDs and can be used as the base of other
Linux distributions, but again, Walnut Creek offers the official
version.</p><p>Slackware Linux is commonly downloaded from ftp sites around
the globe, but it is also frequently mastered on CD and bundled
with other Linux material to be resold. It is organized into
several &ldquo;disk sets&rdquo; which make up the main categories of packages
to install, such as &ldquo;networking&rdquo; or &ldquo;X Windows&rdquo;. Each category
is broken down into individual packages for you to choose from at
installation time. Due to Slackware's highly categorized
organization and its history of being available on the Net, it is
one of the easiest distributions to install from floppy (provided
you're patient enough to download it). Its package format is a
plain Unix .tgz file, gzip-ed tar file. Each disk set also includes
a file that describes the contents of the files that make up the
set. This format, while highly portable, offers little in the way
of dependency checking or upgradability. This will barely slow down
a Unix Wizard, but it can be a moderate hang-up for a newbie.
Fortunately, Slackware's text-mode installation program can be very
verbose and helpful and should suffice for all but the more
advanced users, anyway.</p><p>Slackware requires a single boot and root disk and will
install in 4MB of RAM. It can install from floppy, local partition,
CD-ROM and NFS, and has a mature range of non-commercial packages
to choose from. Slackware 3 is an all-ELF distribution based on
kernel 1.2.13.</p><p>Once Slackware is installed, you're pretty much ready to rock
'n' roll. Slackware does provide some configuration tools for
networking and basic package maintenance, but it does not really
posses any kind of &ldquo;desktop administration&rdquo; utility. However, one
of Slackware's greatest strengths is its age. Many software
packages out there on the Net have been modeled after Slackware, so
you should be able to install pretty much anything without a
hitch.</p><p>Slackware is a good distribution for beginners because it is
available freely on most archive distributions and from ftp sites.
It's also a great distribution for people who like to really get
their hands under the hood and tweak their system (custom
configure, edit rc files, etc.).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b5f580.0x20523a8"></a>WGS Linux Pro 3.0</h2></div></div><p>WorkGroup Solutions' WGS Linux Pro 3.0, or Linux
Encyclopedia, is a large Linux encyclopedia (approximately 1200
pages) containing all the freely redistributable documentation from
the Linux Documentation Project and 4 CD-ROMs of Linux-related
material and distributions. There are more FAQs, docs and HOWTOs
here than I could list, examples of which include the &ldquo;Network
Administrator's Guide&rdquo;, &ldquo;Firewalling and Proxy Server HOWTO&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Linux SCSI HOWTO&rdquo;, &ldquo;Kernel Hacker's Guide&rdquo; and many, many
more.</p><p>Disc one contains the main distribution, which is Red Hat
Mother's Day Release. Mother's Day Release is based on Linux kernel
1.2.11 and uses the a.out binary format as its primary file format.
Note that WGS Linux Pro version 4 will be released shortly and will
be based on Red Hat 3.0.3, described above. The other three discs
are supplemental and contain all sorts of software, which is
provided for the user who requires later releases of software(and
possibly developmental material), which may not be stable.</p><p>The installation of Linux Pro could not have been simpler.
Although it does not contain any boot or root floppy disks, if
you're using DOS, you simply insert the first CD-ROM into your
drive and type &ldquo;install&rdquo; (or double click the icon from Windows).
An installation program will prompt you for your CD-ROM drive type,
Ethernet card type and SCSI type, and build boot and root floppies
for you. Then, simply reboot and the installation begins. If you
don't have DOS handy, you can build boot and root floppies the same
way you normally would for this version of Red Hat, using rawrite,
dd, cat or a mkfloppy script. Since Linux Pro 3 is based on Red
Hat, the section on Red Hat mostly applies, with a few exceptions.
The version of Red Hat used for Linux Pro is a.out and requires 4MB
of RAM to install. Its packages are in a format called &ldquo;.rpp&rdquo;
instead of Red Hat's current package format, which is
&ldquo;.rpm&rdquo;.</p><p>If you're looking for an easy-to-install Linux distribution
with a lot of hard-copy documentation, this might be the one for
you.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b5f580.0x20525b8"></a>Yggdrasil Plug and Play Linux, Fall '95</h2></div></div><p>The first Linux distribution designed for CD, Yggdrasil has
had continued popularity due, in part, to graphical configuration,
bootable floppies included with the distribution, and multimedia
support. Yggdrasil also has a history of including kernels with
patches they have tested but aren't included in the standard Linux
kernel. Fall '95 continues this tradition.</p><p>After installing the &ldquo;Suggested&rdquo; configuration&mdash;at 250 MB,
the only choice smaller than &ldquo;Everything&rdquo;, which takes 600MB&mdash;it
is impossible to compile the kernel without either mounting the CD
or installing some packages that aren't installed as a part of the
&ldquo;Suggested&rdquo; configuration. The manual doesn't say what packages
need to be installed to build the kernel with the CD removed, and
since the control panel doesn't show which packages are already
installed, it's not clear what packages need to be installed. Even
after installing all the needed software components, we still had
to figure out we had to remove
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/version.h in order to successfully
build the kernel; we were not able to find that in the
documentation. This would not have been an important issue except
for the fact that the standard kernel didn't support the 3C509
Ethernet card, and we needed to build a kernel with 3C509 support
in order to test the networking setup. Further testing showed
several functions of the basic control panel, such as printing,
also did not function with the &ldquo;Suggested&rdquo; configuration unless
the CD-ROM was mounted.</p><p>Although running Yggdrasil without the system CD mounted can
take some work, Yggdrasil is one of the few distributions able to
run entirely from the CD. This capability has been included with
Yggdrasil for some time and is a great way to demonstrate Linux to
skeptical friends. Not surprisingly, running multimedia
applications under X entirely from the CD-ROM takes considerable
memory; it doesn't work well with less than 16 MB of RAM.</p><p>Yggdrasil doesn't set up networking as part of the
installation, but it does provide a graphical tool for setting up
basic networking once you get X set up. It also has a reasonably
easy X setup program that gets invoked automatically when you start
X, if you haven't already configured X.</p><p>Yggdrasil doesn't come with some programs that are now
considered standard with Linux, such as</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b5f580.0x2052820"></a>rxvt</h2></div></div><p>. On the other hand, it does seem to include a fairly full
range of multimedia tools. The PC Speaker sound patches, which
provide sound capabilities through the standard PC speaker, are
already applied to the supplied kernel source tree and are one of
the configuration options. Yggdrasil also comes with XEmacs, a
version of Emacs with a good graphical user interface.

to help you compare the features offered by different
distributions, it doesn't say anything about the quality of the
features. The chart doesn't tell the whole story, nor does this
article, because it is impossible for a chart or article to do so.
The chart <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> give you an idea of what the
vendors are trying to provide with their distributions.</p><p>A &ldquo;no&rdquo; isn't necessarily a strike against a distribution.
Don't sit down and count up the number of boxes with &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in
them and consider that a reasonable ranking of the distributions.
Instead, consider the features that you particularly want and need.
If you have further questions, contact the vendors and ask. Buy
from vendors with a money-back guarantee if you are worried you'll
get stuck with a distribution you don't want.</p><p>The labels on the feature chart (page FIXME) aren't entirely
self-explanatory, as you may have already noticed. An explanation
of the entire chart is in order here. If there is any part that you
don't understand or are not interested in, feel free to skip it.
Starting from the top...</p><p>Like everything else, the <span   class="bold"><b>vendor's list
price</b></span> isn't necessarily the price you will pay. Nearly
all these distributions are re-sold. Also, like Linux itself,
Debian has no official vendor and no official vendor price. The
Debian distribution is made available for ftp from ftp.debian.org,
and several vendors provide it, either as the sole distribution on
a CD or as part of a collection.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Packaging</b></span> is technology for
easily and correctly installing, removing, and upgrading parts of
the system. Each part would include several inter-related files.
For example, all the files typically installed together will
probably be included in the same part. The first line of the
Packaging section indicates whether you can at least add and remove
packages with the provided package management tools.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Package upgradability</b></span>
involves preserving (as much as possible) the configuration of the
package correctly on the hard drive while installing a new version.
This involves, at the very least, some method of distinguishing
configuration files from other files, so that when you upgrade, a
package's configuration files are not changed, and you do not have
to re-configure the package. If the package management tools are
unable to preserve the configuration untouched (for example, if the
format of a configuration file changes with a new version), the
package management tools need to notify the administrator of that
fact.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Dependencies</b></span> are a
capability which allows one package to require that another package
also be installed. For instance, LaTeX requires that TeX also be
installed, so if LaTeX and TeX are provided in separate packages,
the package containing LaTeX may require that the TeX package be
installed first, since the functionality of the former depends on
the latter.</p><p>Dependencies are usually absolute&mdash;a package either requires
or does not require another package in order to function. Debian
allows fine shades of distinction: A package can absolutely depend
on another package being installed, it can recommend that any sane
user would want the additional package installed, or it can suggest
that you will probably want to install the other package.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Format</b></span> refers to the way
packages are maintained on the installation media. Debian and Red
Hat each use special archives of their own design which contain the
extra information needed to implement their special installation
features. Slackware installs standard &ldquo;.tar.gz&rdquo; or &ldquo;.tgz&rdquo;
archives created by using tar to archive a set of files and gzip to
compress the archive; those archives do not, therefore, have the
extra information needed to remove or upgrade archives. Yggdrasil
and Linux Universe install by copying files directly from a file
system on the CD-ROM to the hard drive, so they can only use their
package management tools to install from the installation
CD.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Third-party packages</b></span> are
closely related to format; those distributions which provide
single-file packages are capable of installing packages built by
third parties, downloaded from the Internet or found on other CDs.
As an example of what can be done with third-party packages,
Caldera built the Caldera Network Desktop upon Red Hat Commercial
Linux (RHCL) and added new packages in Red Hat's RPM format to
create a new distribution that is essentially a superset of
RHCL.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Source packages</b></span> means the
source code is also installable with the package management
tools.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Buildable Source</b></span> means the
package has the capability to build entire packages with one
command (which may or may not be integrated with the package
management tools).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Multi-architecture</b></span> means
support for more than one binary architecture. The Intel 80386 and
above (denoted here as i86) is certainly the most common CPU
architecture supported, but Linux also runs on other platforms,
including some Amigas and Ataris, DEC's Alpha, the Acorn
Archimedes, and Sparc. Some of the distributions are beginning to
include support for more than one architecture. We expect, by the
time you read this chart, support for more architectures will be,
at least, announced by more distributions.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Graphical and text-based package
management</b></span> refer to the tools available for managing
packages. <span   class="bold"><b>Graphical</b></span> refers to
native X-based tools, and
<span   class="bold"><b>text-based</b></span> refers to those that
run in character mode (even in an xterm or rxvt session).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Series sub-selection</b></span> refers
to logically grouping packages together into intelligent groups
while also making the selection of individual components possible.
For instance, making a group or series of everything related to the
TeX typesetting system, but also allowing the user to choose not to
install all the fonts or to leave out LaTeX.</p><p>Over the past year, the Linux community has been migrating
from the a.out to the ELF <span   class="bold"><b>binary file
format</b></span>. ELF has many advantages, but it has been
necessary to move slowly to avoid causing unnecessary pain.
However, ELF is now the standard, and we have purposely not
included any distributions that do not at least support ELF
binaries.</p><p>ELF-based distributions can choose to include a.out
libraries, in order to provide support for legacy
applications.</p><p>Most distributions (all in this lineup) provide iBCS2 support
for binaries from many i86 Unix platforms.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Supported architectures</b></span> are
the types of machines supported by the distribution.</p><p>The standard PC architecture doesn't provide a standard way
to boot from CD-ROMs, so in order to install Linux, it is not
possible to simply boot a Linux CD-ROM. [No letters to the editor
telling us that the Adaptec 2940 provides support for booting from
a CD-ROM; that's not &ldquo;support by the standard PC
architecture&rdquo;&mdash;ED] This means the distribution needs to provide
some other way of booting. There are essentially two ways of doing
this. One is to provide a bootable floppy disk containing the Linux
kernel, and the other is to rely on already having DOS installed.
Several distributions provide both options. In order to boot from a
floppy, either a bootable floppy needs to be included with the
distribution, or a way needs to be provided to make a floppy from
files on the CD-ROM.</p><p>Unfortunately, it's hard to make a single floppy that is
sufficient for booting on all platforms&mdash;but failing to supply a
floppy with a kernel makes the user rely on having another
operating system (DOS, Linux, or any version of Unix will do) with
which to create the floppy. Fortunately, this is rarely a problem,
but if you have no other operating system available (even on a
friend's computer) to write the necessary floppies, you will
probably want to purchase a distribution which provides the
necessary floppies as part of the package.</p><p>It is possible to boot Linux directly from DOS, and some
distributions provide an option to use no boot floppies at all by
first booting DOS and then booting Linux from the CD-ROM.</p><p>Some distributions provide a wide variety of boot images,
whereas others use one or only a few. If you are able to make
floppies yourself, those with more boot floppy choices
<span   class="emphasis"><em>may</em></span> prove easier to configure for your
hardware. The <span   class="bold"><b>Boot Images</b></span> line
doesn't count duplicates for different size drives, it only counts
the choices for one size of floppy drive.</p><p>All the distributions provide at least the option of booting
from floppy, and all of them provide a way to make your own boot
floppies from the CD-ROM under DOS and/or Linux. Some also provide
some assistance (under DOS, Linux, or both) to make choosing or
creating the floppy or floppy set easier.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>number of floppies
required</b></span> to install the system varies widely. Debian
installs its entire &ldquo;base system&rdquo; from a set of five floppies and
then requires one blank floppy after the installation to create an
appropriate boot disk. If you boot the Linux Universe CD-ROM from
DOS, it can install without any floppies at all.</p><p>While most of this article has assumed you are installing
from CD-ROM (after all, that's what most of the vendors provide),
that's not necessarily true. You may wish to copy packages to a
subdirectory of a local hard drive and install from there, or you
may wish to install from floppy, via NFS from a local server, via
anonymous FTP, or from a tape.</p><p>In order to install on most notebooks, support for PCMCIA
(also known as PC Card) is required, unless you are want to install
one of the distributions available on floppies and are interested
in shuffling floppies for hours. If you have a PCMCIA Ethernet or
SCSI adaptor supported by the Linux PCMCIA card services package,
some distributions make it possible for you to install from a
network location over Ethernet or from a SCSI CD-ROM connected to
the SCSI adaptor. This can be a real time saver.</p><p>If you don't want to partition your disk, some distributions
provide the option of installing in a <b  >\LINUX</b>
subdirectory of a DOS file system using a Linux file system called
UMSDOS. While this imposes on Linux all the inefficiencies of the
DOS file system, it is an easy way to get started using Linux
without committing a partition to do so. Yggdrasil goes one step
farther, allowing you to install the base Linux system without
booting Linux, using a DOS program to do the installation.</p><p>Most distributions now have customized documentation written
about them, which is either included with the distribution by
default or is available as an option. Some distributions have been
covered in other books available in bookstores, and some books
include distributions.</p><p>One of the most difficult parts of configuring a Linux system
is configuring the X Window System. The XFree86 Project, Inc.
provides a configuration program called xf86config, which has a
fairly basic user interface and requires you to know a lot about
your configuration. It is, however, quite complete. Some
distributions provide tools to make X configuration easier.</p><p>Some vendors provide a support program, and some provide
several different support programs. This chart only mentions
whether at least one program is available&mdash;check with the vendors
if you have specific requirements that you need met.</p><p>Some of the distributions include configuration tools, mostly
graphical ones. If you are not familiar with administering a Linux
or Unix system, you are likely to find most common tasks simplified
by a user interface that handles common tasks easily. None of the
configuration tools provided with any of the distributions prevents
you from doing your configuration manually, so there is no reason
to complain if you prefer to configure your system by hand.</p><p>In particular, we looked for configuration tools for setting
up and maintaining a network, adding and deleting users and groups,
mounting and un mounting file systems, setting up print services,
and manipulating boot scripts (generally kept in /etc/init.d).
Again, we did not try to rank them in usefulness, and some of the
scripts were definitely more functional than others for our
purposes. On the other hand, a script with more functionality than
one user needs could include needless, confusing detail for another
user. Configuration scripts should have a review of their own some
day, but mentioning whether or not they exist is a first
step.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b5f580.0x1f65540"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>Linux distributions have changed a lot in the few years they
have been around. The Linux File System Standard has improved their
ability to inter-operate; binaries compiled for one distribution
are now more likely to run on another distribution, because
standard files are more likely to be in the same place from one
distribution to another. As distributions competed, bugs have been
worked out of all of them, thus, users have benefited from
distributions they haven't even used.</p><p>Since no single distribution provides an optimal environment
for everyone, each distribution contributes something to the pot.
Furthermore, having distributions targeted for different kinds of
users means no distribution is pressured into complete mediocrity
by an attempt to be all things to all people. It's a well-worn
clich&eacute; that to do all things equally well is to do nothing
at all well...</p><p>Bryan Phillippe is a 21-year-old Linux enthusiast who also
