    As the publishers of <i  >LJ</i>, SSC is committed to the use of the
    Linux operating system throughout our offices.  Many of
    SSC's operations revolve around our Progress database server
    which still ran, until recently, on a difficult-to-maintain
    At&amp;T SVR4 486 tied into our Linux network. In this column we
    outline how we made the conversion to an ELF-based Linux
    system running the SCO Unix version of Progress 6.3F08.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12bd580.0x13b5870"></a></h2></div></div><p>At SSC, we've been using Progress for
years (since 1985), and a Linux port of Progress is not, and, as
far as we know, will not, be available from Progress Software
Corporation. We decided to investigate the feasibility of using the
iBCS emulation package together with the well-supported SCO Unix
version of Progress.
</p><p>SSC's database is used throughout the office for order
processing, subscriptions, sales reports and plots, marketing,
advertising, billing statements, label printing and shipping.
Integrated with the database is the authorization and settlement of
credit card orders by means of a certified external program
developed in-house. Future plans for the database include automatic
ordering from our web site and address matching software with CASS
(Coding Accuracy Support System) certification. SSC prefers to stay
with Progress, rather than change to another database specifically
ported to Linux, such as Postgress, since we have invested
considerable time customizing the database for SSC's growing needs.
Progress also has a proven track record of being very stable and
reliable. That is all very well, but what is iBCS? iBCS stands for
the Intel Binary Compatibility Specification, which specifies the
interface between application programs and the surrounding
operating system environment for i386-based systems. This allows a
number of binaries developed and compiled for other Unix OSs to run
on Linux. The freely available package is still being developed but
a recent version of iBCS compiled and installed without a hitch
under Linux kernel 1.2.13. The demo version of SCO Progress we
ordered arrived in a black box with manuals and a DAT tape.
Installation did not go flawlessly; following the prescribed
procedure worked only up to the point where the remaining archives
were supposed to be read from the tape. I ended up reading them
&ldquo;by hand&rdquo; using cpio and tweaking the installation scripts to
look on the disk instead.</p><p>After that it turned out the file permissions and group/user
IDs were set incorrectly and the standard shell scripts had the
wrong directory paths in them. It helps to have an existing
Progress v6 setup, although it's certainly possible to fix this
without one. At this point, I was able to run the db server in
single- and multi-user mode&mdash;time to start looking for other, more
sneaky problems. It turned out that setting the TZ environment
variable and using a local password file is required for SCO
Progress; otherwise, you get a lot of memory violations. An
invaluable tool to help you solve this kind of problem is
<span   class="bold"><b>itrace</b></span>, and it is included in the
iBCS package. It took some preparation to adapt our custom Progress
code for the move, but after that the transition was mostly just a
matter of copying all the SSC database-related files over to a new
system. I didn't even have to do a time-consuming dump and reload
of the database, because both architectures were x86-based. After
several more days of testing, we were confident enough with the
setup to go ahead and order the &ldquo;real&rdquo; version of Progress for
SCO Unix. For reasons not entirely clear, the program arrived on
floppy disks, which seemed more of a pain than the tape at first
but it was actually easier to adapt the install scripts to work
correctly, requiring only patience and lots of disk swapping. The
server wouldn't run in &ldquo;raw&rdquo; mode, a major problem with the
standard SCO version. That is, database consistency couldn't be
guaranteed. This turned out to be a bug in the SCO version and
after requesting and applying the latest patch (6.3F08), this was
fixed.</p><p>Switching from the old server to the new was a pleasant
surprise for everyone (except me) and consisted simply of logging
on to a different computer&mdash;everything else looked and worked the
same. We all were prepared for some multi-user glitches, but none
occurred.</p><p>There are few disadvantages to running SCO Progress under
Linux, other than some minor installation incompatibilities and no
&ldquo;official&rdquo; Linux support (although Progress SCO technical support
is quite helpful). I can't think of any others, aside from the fact
that Progress v6 under Linux shows the same bugs as under
SCO!</p><p>On the contrary, there are quite a number of advantages for
SSC or any office environment already using Linux. Firstly, over
the last few months, the new system proved to be just as stable.
Most of SSC's operations revolve around the Progress database
server, and without it, business grinds to a costly halt. It now
fits well with the rest of the network; there are no more problems
with shared directories or slightly different commands and
environments. It's faster and more responsive; record searching and
scanning is much faster. One reason for that is Linux has dynamic
buffering (using free memory), which speeds up the overall system
I/O. And of course, it's cheaper&mdash;Linux is free&mdash;SCO is not.</p><p>But what better proof than to let one of SSC's employees and
a long-time user of Progress, Lydia Kinata, rave about the virtues
of the new system in her own words.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12bd580.0x13b5be0"></a>Lydia Speaks</h2></div></div><p>I've been using the Progress database since April 1994. SSC
was a much smaller company when I started, and my job description
included a wide range of responsibilities from shipping and order
entry to accounts receivable and marketing. I have been in a
position to regularly use most, if not all, of the end user
capacities of the database. As a user, I waited with bated breath
for the transition of the database from AT&amp;T SVR4 Unix to
Linux. I was involved in the testing phases of the new database,
but I've been around long enough to know that a transition this
massive usually does not go smoothly. Phil Hughes, publisher of
<i  >Linux Journal</i> and chief pesterment of SSC,
prepared us all for a bumpy ride by announcing repeatedly that
Peter and our systems administrator, Liem Banneman, would be
working all night on the transition. I was prepared to believe
him.</p><p>By 5 pm Wednesday night, we had all cleared out our home
directories on the computer that was home to the SVR4 version of
Progress. I came in the next morning ready to find Peter and Liem
bleary-eyed and cranky. I telnet-ed to the computer with the SCO
version of Progress installed and settled down to what I thought
would be a long day of bugs. I was overjoyed to discover that
everything worked! In fact, the database functioned almost exactly
the same as before, with a few pleasant exceptions. Under SVR4, vi
worked very poorly. New users often were left with the impression
that they were hitting capital letters accidentally at the command
line or that vi was just &ldquo;weird&rdquo;. Whole lines would repeat
erratically, or the cursor would not really be where it appeared to
be. Under Linux, this problem went away. Certain time-consuming
database operations, like global key searches, are faster under
Linux; having the same home directory files accessible on all
computers is also an advantage. Formerly, we would have to rcp
files to have them on the SVR4 system and our personal
workstations, which was a mild annoyance.</p><p>For most purposes, the database looked and acted at 8 am on
Thursday just as it had at 5 pm on Wednesday. To date, we have not
experienced any database crashes, neither have we discovered any
bugs that could be traced to Linux. In all cases, bugs could be
traced to SCO Progress itself or to temporary bugs at the
programmer's level.</p><p>SCO Progress running under Linux works.</p></div></div>
