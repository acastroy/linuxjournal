The new world of Internet telephony is facing one of the same
challenges that early long-distance calling did. Here's one
of the techniques for doing a high-quality call over VoIP.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe6c580.0xf64298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Most of us have experienced telephone calls with disturbing echoes on
the line. Low echo volumes together with discernible delay
can make a line completely unusable, with the call being terminated after
the exchange of a few halting sentences. Traditionally, problems with
echo have been experienced on long-distance or international calls,
particularly those involving satellite connections.
</p><p>
For many people new to software-based VoIP telephony systems, such
as Asterisk, the phenomenon of voice echo comes as an unpleasant
surprise. This is true even for those who come to the business
after working with traditional PBX systems or proprietary VoIP
equipment. Suddenly echo is a problem on local calls, and the
traditionally troublesome long-distance and satellite calls are
completely echo-free.
</p><p>
In this article, we discuss the origins of echo and how it manifests
itself in the VoIP world with particular reference to Asterisk and other
software-based telephony systems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe6c580.0xf64450"></a>
Where Does Echo Come from and Why Is It a Problem?</h2></div></div><p>
Echo in telephony systems is caused by two main
phenomena: the first is electrical echo due to
imperfect impedance matching, and the second is
acoustic echo due to microphone pickup of audio
output. Both these sources produce similar effects and
have to be treated similarly. The major difference
is electrical echo is a property of the
line connection and remains mostly constant
throughout the call, while acoustic echo varies in
strength and delay depending on the changing acoustic
environment of the echo source. For instance, on a
hands-free cell-phone call, the echo characteristics
change as the speaker moves around.
</p><p>
Electrical signals of all types always are reflected at line
terminations,
except when the load at the line end exactly matches the impedance rating
of the line itself. In fact, the meaning of, say, &ldquo;75-ohm
cabling&rdquo; is
precisely that in order to have no signal reflections, the cable must
be terminated by a 75-ohm load. Line impedance is a property of
the cable that is affected only by the cable geometry. As no cables are
geometrically perfect over their length and no load impedance is perfectly
accurate, there always is some reflection at a line termination.
</p><p>
Where digital signals are concerned, as long as the reflections are a
small enough fraction of the data transmission, the reflections do not
cause errors in reading the bit values. Thus, digital systems can tolerate
considerable echo.
</p><p>
The human ear has quite different characteristics, however; it is an incredibly
sensitive instrument. The softest sound that can be heard has an acoustic
power about a hundred thousand billion times smaller than the
power at the threshold of pain. As long as sounds vary by
<span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> about
a factor of 100 or so, the ear hears a similar level of sound.
So even
what electrically looks like a small reflection can sound about the same
volume as the original signal to the human ear.
</p><p>
And, the traditional telephone circuits are far from perfect. Two-wire
circuits from analog lines terminate at devices called hybrids
that convert the two-wire analog signal to four-wire signals before
digitization. The loads at the hybrids vary quite widely, as does the
impedance of the low-cost subscriber loop wiring.
The result is
almost every call that involves an analog telephone anywhere in the
circuit has electrical reflections that can be interpreted by the
ear as troublesome echoes.
</p><p>
If this is so, why is echo not a problem on every call? The answer
is, if the echo is heard at the same time as the caller is speaking,
it is heard as part of the side tone and goes unnoticed. Echo becomes
noticeable only when there is a delay between speaking and hearing your voice
echoed. This is why echo is a problem only for traditional telephony
over
long distances. The round-trip delay on a coast-to-coast US call is more
than
30ms, which is enough for echo to cause irritation. Satellite delays
are much longer still.
</p><p>
VoIP intrinsically has packetization, depacketization and processing
delays built into its protocols. That is why, from the point of view of
echo, every VoIP call is like a very long-distance call.

Figure 1. How VoIP and Analog Telephone Systems Interact to
Cause Troublesome Echo
</p></div></div><p>
Figure 1 shows a typical VoIP scenario. The echo is heard on
the VoIP phone: the caller on the analog line hears only a normal side tone,
because there are no signal delays. Because delay is a necessary component
of perceived echo, traditional PBXes that switch analog or T1/E1 traffic
have no perceived echo problems, as their intrinsic end-to-end delay is
low. It is the packetization and processing delays inherent in VoIP that
cause existing echo to become a problem.

What to Do about Echo</h2></div></div><p>
Those of you who have watched old black-and-white movies depicting
long-distance conversations may remember the callers shouting into the
mouthpieces in order for the other party to repeat what was said. The reason
the callers had to shout was low receiver volume. The
attenuated volume was the way echo was dealt with before powerful digital
processing was available. The signal heard by a listener was attenuated considerably
by the equipment. The echo passed through the attenuator
twice&mdash;once
on the way out and once on the way back&mdash;and this provided a measure
of echo reduction. The use of attenuation to eliminate echo was not a
satisfactory solution, and this method was abandoned when digital echo
cancellation became available. However, the technique still is valuable in
the soft PBX world as a mechanism for getting rid of the echo that remains
after the somewhat limited software echo cancellers have done their job.
</p><p>
Digital echo cancellation is based on subtracting from the received
signal a correction based on the response of the system to a short spike
of sound, called the finite impulse response (FIR). The FIR is simply
the echo you would hear from a short ping.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8424f2.large.jpg"><img src="8424f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Response of a Typical System to a Unit Impulse
</p></div></div><p>
Figure 2 shows 128 digital sound samples or taps taken
at a rate of 8,000 times per second, covering 128/8 = 16 milliseconds. The
impulse occurred at time zero. The dots represent the individual sample
values that have been normalized to an impulse size of 1.
</p><p>
The first thing to notice is the echo does not appear to be very
strong. The impulse had a value of 1, and the highest peak in the response
is less than 0.25, falling rapidly to tiny values. But because of the
sensitivity of the ear, the echo produced by this system sounds almost
as loud as the spoken voice, resulting in a completely intolerable echo
on a VoIP system.
</p><p>
The echo from the impulse has an effect that lasts
about 10ms (80 taps). To cancel out
the echo properly, the input from all the nonzero taps needs
to be taken into account. This is why the number of
taps in an echo canceller is important. The number
of taps is always a power of 2: 32, 64, 128, 256 and
so on. Naturally, the higher the number of taps, the
higher the computing load and memory requirement.
</p><p>
This echo starts at tap 7, or about 1ms after the impulse. The delay
is due to switching and transmission delays on the digital and analog
lines. You can see why it is important that echo cancellation takes place
close to the echo source. If this echo were being cancelled at the far end
of a transatlantic call, there would be many more leading idle taps, so the
true echo would be shifted back, perhaps right out of the tap sample. When
echo is heard on a system with good echo cancellation, it usually is
because an unexpectedly complex system has switching and transmission
delays that have shifted the FIR backwards out of the tap sample.
</p><p>
For this call, beyond about 70 taps, the echo tail is small. In practice,
this echo canceller would be about as effective at 64 taps, particularly
if the leading 8 taps were eliminated by better
buffering. That would cut the echo cancellation computation load by half.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8424f3.large.jpg"><img src="8424f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. A Typical Echo Canceller
</p></div></div><p>
The FIR is used to calculate a series of correction factors that represent
the echo component of the received signal. Mathematically, the echo to
be subtracted for each voice sample is given by the dot product of two
vectors of dimension equal to the number of taps. On a 128-tap
echo canceller, for example, it would look like this:
</p><p>
Echo = (128 values of FIR) &sdot; (128 previous tap samples of
transmission)
</p><p>
By subtracting this &ldquo;echo&rdquo; from the signal as received, a substantially
echo-free receive signal is obtained. However, because of rounding
errors and non-linearities, some of the echo remains. The nonlinear
processor cuts out the remaining received signal if the signal is small
enough. In higher-performance echo cancellers, the nonlinear processor
then substitutes &ldquo;comfort noise&rdquo;, background noise so the line
does not sound dead.
</p><p>
Obtaining the FIR is an iterative training process based on measuring
the residual signal after the calculated echo has been subtracted and
changing the FIR estimate. This process requires silence on
the other end of the line&mdash;there is no doubletalk. The doubletalk
detector detects when both parties are speaking at the same time and
disables the FIR optimization process until the doubletalk condition
has ceased. The iterative FIR optimization converges quite slowly, but
as the calculations are done 8,000 times per second, within a second or
two of the start of a call, a good echo canceller will be fully
trained.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe6c580.0xf652c0"></a>
Echo Cancellation in Soft PBX Environments</h2></div></div><p>
Echo cancellation is a hugely CPU-intensive process. A
complete echo canceller for 92 simultaneous calls, or
four PRI T1 lines, consumes on the order of
one GIPS. The calculations involve mainly 8-bit
operations, and in other ways are not optimum for
the PC architecture or CPU cache. Thus, software echo
cancellation is one of the major factors limiting
the performance of soft PBX systems.
</p><p>
In an effort to improve overall system performance, software echo
cancellers are usually highly optimized to reduce the PC load.
One compromise made in the interest of saving CPU cycles is that the
&ldquo;learning&rdquo; algorithms that update the FIR estimate are not run every time
a voice sample is processed, but much less frequently. So the system
trains slowly. You often hear quite considerable echo well into
the conversation until the echo canceller trains and the echo decreases.
</p><p>
Another of the trade-offs is the absence of a nonlinear processor,
which often is eliminated completely in soft echo cancellers. This is
why there is usually some residual echo on systems such as
Asterisk, even after training.
</p><p>
The goal under Asterisk was to provide software echo cancellation for a
full quad E1 card (120 channels) with current PC technology and still
be able to do other useful voice and data processing. This is indeed
possible, but as discussed, the echo canceller trains slowly and after
training there is still usually some remaining echo.
</p><p>
You can use the old-fashioned attenuation method to reduce residual
echo. The transmit and receive gain settings in Asterisk (txgain and
rxgain) can be set to negative values that reduce the sound volumes,
but also produce acceptable final echo performance. One limitation
is the txgain and rxgain settings in Asterisk are global, meaning
the gain settings are compounded for any system with bridging. For
bridged TDM systems, it is hard to get the balance between voice volume
and residual echo right. But for simpler systems, setting txgain =
&ndash;10 or thereabouts usually produces acceptable call volume with little
perceived echo after about 10 seconds.
</p><p>
The remaining problem under Asterisk is the slow convergence of the
FIR estimation. An ingenious mechanism for dramatically improving the
convergence time of the echo canceller is Asterisk's echo training
option. Transmitted voice is disabled for a short time during ringing
and a spike of sound is transmitted to measure the FIR directly instead
of learning it iteratively over many samples. The echo training option
eliminates most of the echo at the beginning of the call in many
cases. But its use is restricted to simple systems where ringing can be
detected. It does not function on PRI T1 or E1 lines.

Optimization of Echo Cancellation</h2></div></div><p>
Today, all long-distance calls over 600km routinely are echo-cancelled at
each end. Cell-phone calls to the PSTN always are echo-cancelled. Calls
originating from digital end points, such as ISDN or VoIP, should have
no echo. Thus, only analog calls over distances less than
600km actually need any echo cancellation. Even local calls often are
echo-cancelled by the PSTN, simply because the capacity is there.
</p><p>
The result is that on most VoIP-PSTN gateways, including Asterisk,
a great deal of echo cancellation goes on that is unnecessary
and, in fact, detrimental to voice quality. For example, a VoIP-based call
center may handle mostly 1-800 calls, the majority being long-distance
ones that require no echo cancellation.
</p><p>
Although it is complicated and computationally intensive to cancel echo,
it turns out that it is quite easy to measure whether echo is present on a call (Figure 4). A simple algorithm built into a Field Programmable Gate Array can
measure within a second or two of speech whether echo cancellation is required
for the call. If the call has no echo, echo cancellation can be
disabled. Thus, for a system using hardware echo cancellation in DSPs,
it is possible to allocate DSP resources dynamically to the calls that
need them. But the really dramatic improvements are seen in systems with
software echo cancellation.

Figure 4. Echo cancellation isn't necessary for
incoming calls that already are echo-cancelled.
An echo detector can be used to switch off echo
cancellation for these calls.
</p></div></div><p>
In software echo cancellers, the considerable CPU load that can be freed
by echo detection is always immediately available to other processes,
which in turn can increase the quality and capacity of the
system significantly. More important, echo detection changes the optimization point of
the echo canceller design. If only a fraction of calls will require any
echo cancellation, the canceller itself can afford to be designed
to include the additional features, such as nonlinear processing and
fast convergence, that will make the audio truly toll-quality.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Echo on a telephone call is an annoying phenomenon that has been mostly
under control in the classic telephony system, but it is rearing
its head again as VoIP proliferates. Its effective control is vitally
important for the eventual success of VoIP technologies in general,
because of the effect of echo on perceived quality. For open-source VoIP
PBX/IVR technologies to become truly mainstream, toll-quality audio must be
a given, and this requires reliable, high-performance echo cancellation.
