SSH Tip</h4><p>
I was very happy to see John Ouellette's article
in the September 2005 issue. In particular, it
was nice to see someone discuss limiting of remote
command execution using the authorized _keys file.
However, I would like to point out that with a little
extra work, it is entirely possible to secure your ssh
private key with a decent password and still use it
in scripts and cron jobs without human intervention.
</p><p>
Keychain, when combined with ssh-agent, allows
you to re-use an ssh-agent session between logins.
Once you use keychain to launch ssh-agent, you
need to enter the password for each of your private
keys only once. Keychain then keeps your key decrypted
until it is killed. We use this method on all of
our production servers for secure remote backups.
Since our servers are rarely rebooted, the keychain
remains active for as long as I need it.
Should I reboot the server, or should I be forced to
kill the keychain or ssh-agent, then and only then
will I have to retype my password.

Fresh Air for Reading</h4><p>
This weekend some friends and I were trekking in Jotunheimen, a
popular national park in Norway. At the top of a mountain called
Surtningssue (2,368 meters), I felt a sudden urge to read
<i  >LJ</i>.

Enough with the Kid Pictures</h4><p>
I read <i  >Linux Journal</i> because I run a Linux
consultancy business, and
<i  >LJ</i>
does an excellent job of helping me keep up to date with some of the
developments in the Linux world, both commercial and technical.
</p><p>
Some of the letters published are amusing, particularly when people seem
disproportionately upset by a particular advertisement. However, we all
have our foibles and mine is an abhorrence of the pictures of readers'
children month after month. How many readers really need or even want to
see them?

Happy Archos User</h4><p>
I happened to come across your review of the Archos
PMA430 [September 2005] and would like to offer some counterpoint.
The PMA430 is my third Archos unit; a 20GB MP3,
the great AV340 and now the PMA. So I am happy with
their products in general.
</p><p>
Now specifically to the PMA430. First of all, the SDK
package, such as it is, has been released.
Second, programs for Microsoft formats such as Excel,
Word and PowerPoint are also available, and in fact
work quite well. Third, there are some sync problems
with films, but this is easily overcome with the
correct software. Fourth, I use the PMA Wi-Fi quite
often, and overall it seems fast enough for me.
</p><p>
Another complaint was that the PMA430 did not have
enough software or functions to make it worthwhile.
This seems rather not the point, since not many
people would have use for a bare-bones PC. We all
find apps outside of those that come with the PC.
So it seems quite natural for PMA430 users to find
more and better ways to use it.
</p><p>
I have had mine for about two months and find new
uses for it every day. In this short time I feel
lost when it isn't in my pocket. Last, I was able
to purchase one for less than $700, and Archos had
a special that threw in $150 worth of accessories.
</p><p>
My only complaint is that I don't have any Linux
experience, so the learning curve is pretty steep.
Luckily, there are lots of great people out there
working hard to make this product even better.

Java Tool Recommendation</h4><p>
About the article titled &ldquo;Developing GNOME
Applications with Java&rdquo; [July 2005]: the article is excellently
written and provided some important insight, precisely
as I'm integrating several legacy applications into a
Linux/Java enterprise solution for a company in Italy.
</p><p>
I'd like to point out to <i  >LJ</i> readers that Borland has released JBuilder
Foundation free of charge, even for commercial use. I had been
plugging several solutions in to a toolset for Java GUI development under
Linux (including some mentioned in the article, such as the Glade XML GUI
generator), but then I came upon JBuilder Foundation, and it solved all
my needs in one powerful tool.
</p><p>
I'd like to suggest you contact your distributor in Brazil
because they're charging us $13.60 US per issue here, or 31.95 Reais on
today's exchange rate. That is a 272% increase from the US newsstand
price. Brazil is one of the world's biggest Linux and open-source bases
and still we pay a hefty price for valuable printed information.

Linux in 1856</h4><p>
I read with interest the article &ldquo;First Beowulf Cluster in
Space&rdquo;, in
the September 2005 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. However, I was surprised to
read, in his profile, that co-author Ian McLoughlin has been using Linux
since 1856! What kernel was he using then and what CPU was he running
it on?

Why Split LinuxWorld Booths?</h4><p>
I visited LinuxWorld Expo here in the San Francisco Bay Area (Moscone
Center) today.
I was very disappointed, nay, irritated to find the glitzy, high-roller
moneyed exhibitors on the first floor, with the .org exhibitors (for
example, Free Software Foundation, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo, Mozilla,
LTSP, Etherboot and so on) ghettoed onto the second floor.
These .org organizations are the heart and lifeblood of Linux and
deserve their places cheek by jowl (and, do I mean jowl!) with the
commercial stuff they enable by their existence and the hard work and
dedication of their supporters and developers.

Networking Tip</h4><p>
Marcel Gagn&eacute;'s instructions for setting up ndiswrapper
leave out an obscure adjustment that is needed
at least on the Fedora Core 2 distribution I am
using. The problem may not occur in other Linux
distributions, but it is the source of frequent
networking failures at boot-up on FC2.
</p><p>
If your network card is a pcmcia device, the
pcmcia driver has to be ready before the attempt
to bring up wlan0. Unfortunately, in /etc/rc3.d,
/etc/rc4.d and /etc/rc5.d, the pcmcia script
has a much later sequence number (S24pcmcia) than
the network script (S10network). Since these are
merely symbolic links, the order can be changed
with a minimum of risk. I moved the network link to
S11network, and the pdmcia link to S10pcmcia in all
three directories.
</p><p>
As Marcel would say, voil&agrave;!

Split Off the Baby Section, Please</h4><p>
What is this, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Parenting Magazine</em></span>? You need to
make a separate section for all the pictures of babies/kids/stuffed
animals/pets and dedicate the Letters section to actual intelligent
commentary.
I, for one, am sick of wading through all the &ldquo;my daughter
sketched a penguin just...for...you!&rdquo; nonsense so that I can &lt;gasp&gt; read
actual technical letters about Linux.
I subscribe to your magazine for Linux know-how
and articles; if I wanted family-friendly piffle,

Our six-month-old daughter Guen loves Linux, as you can clearly see from

Viv(a|e) Marcel!</h4><p>
To the everyday Canadian, French is probably as
ubiquitous and familiar as Spanish is to us Southerners
(I grew up in Florida where we learned &ldquo;Cuban&rdquo; in
school&mdash;seven years of conversational Spanish&mdash;and I
now live in Mexico II, aka Los Angeles). However,
to the majority of English-speaking Linux enthusiasts
who have any second-language experience at all, it is
frequently Spanish, not French. This totally leaves
us out of the joke.
</p><p>
I finally cracked this month and had another look;
the mention of Damn Small Linux and a photo of a USB
pen drive proved irresistible [August 2005], so I did a flyby and
took one more look. I'm glad I did. Marcel seems
to have lowered the language-barrier veil and made
his excellent column accessible to us all, not just
the French-speaking sector.

Archives, Patents</h4><p>
I am a subscriber to your excellent magazine. Can I suggest you make a
service that at the end of each year it would be possible to order a DVD
with all the contents from 1994 to present day? That would be nice, and I
for one certainly would order it each year.
</p><p>
But my main reason to write to you is these damn
patents. It was good they did not succeed in the EU
(I am in Finland). It was only delayed&mdash;patents will
be back on the agenda in a year, and we will have to
live again through waiting for an axe to our neck. I
have been thinking what a counterstrike would be.
</p><p>
There should be an organization that would take
care of people's patents so that GPL software can use
them gratis but others must pay. These moneys will
be used to finance further patents, defend patents,
buy patents to be used in GPL software and so on.
I am sorry I don't have couple of millions to kick
the show up.
</p><p>
Microsoft and others have been very keen to point
out that Linux uses some patented algorithms.
But this finger pointing has been&mdash;should I say&mdash;one-sided. All MS wares are closed source, so if the
source code were combed, I might think a lot of patented
things might be found.

Acer Laptop Refund Offer</h4><p>
I thought I'd share the following story that has some
interesting angles and happened just over the past few
weeks as I bought a new Acer laptop (Aspire 1674WLMi).
</p><p>
I bought the machine at a local (Dutch) consumer
electronics reseller called MediaMarkt. I asked the
salespeople if I could buy it without an OS, which,
of course, was not possible. However, I could try
contacting Acer themselves through the local importer,
Acer Benelux, they said. I contacted Acer by e-mail, and
indeed there was a restitution procedure. I couldn't
believe my luck!
</p><p>
After supplying them with a serial number and a scanned
copy of the receipt, I received the &ldquo;agreement&rdquo;
in PDF. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a
disappointment: the restitution would amount to EUR
30 (about the same in US$), but I would have to send
the laptop to the Acer offices somewhere else in the
Netherlands, where they would reformat the drive and
send it back to me within five working days. Obviously,
sending an expensive machine at my own risk and at my
own cost would cost me far more than EUR 30, and during
that time I could not use the machine. And, I'd have
to reinstall again after getting it back. In fact,
having installed Fedora Core 4 as soon as I arrived
home after the purchase, already invalidated the
agreement (how can you know beforehand?), although my
contact at Acer did not specifically complain about
it. So much for the restitution procedure.
</p><p>
The interesting angle is that Acer <span   class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> have a
procedure, but it is constructed in such a way that it
is not profitable for the average consumer to exercise
it. Furthermore, when in my final message to Acer I
concluded that it was a financially uninteresting
proposal and asked if I could simply return the
Microsoft CDs and license (obviously, it's of no use
to me), they said that the procedure was the only
formal way, since Acer, being an OEM, was the owner
of the license. Then I decided I would give away the
Microsoft stuff to a friend and asked a befriended M$
employee how that works. He said that you can't!

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Michel   <br><br>
</p><p>
The trick is to break up the &ldquo;bundle&rdquo; before you
accept the license for the preinstalled software.
Until you power up the machine, actually have
a chance to read the license and click OK the
license doesn't bind you (see <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/5628" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/5628</a>).  &mdash;Ed.

Fan Mail</h4><p>
Once again, you have more than justified the subscription fee!
This issue [September 2005] contains a bunch of pearls....
</p><p>
The Open and Free Software aficionado in me was overwhelmed by
the social-economic revolution report in the &ldquo;identity
metasystem&rdquo;
article....I crave the day when I will be able to explain fully to my
die-hard capitalist friends the practicality of the grass-roots economy!
</p><p>
The embedded developer in me rejoiced in reading the story and
the specs of the &ldquo;First Beowulf Cluster in Space&rdquo;.
</p><p>
And the average Linux user in me got up to speed on Syndication
and Podcasting.
</p><p>
Keep the focus and motivation!
