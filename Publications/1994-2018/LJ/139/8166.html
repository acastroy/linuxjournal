Simple Linux-based devices bring real networking features
to a system that runs over power lines.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e3580.0x1adbb30"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Power line communication (PLC) technology allows you
to transmit data by way of the electric grid's low- and
medium-voltage power lines. Any device in a building thus
may access a LAN to share resources. Figure 1 shows the Ovislink
HomePlug Ethernet Bridges we currently are using.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8166f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. HomePlug Ethernet Bridge
</p></div></div><p>
PLC offers obvious advantages, the main one being that it is
unnecessary to lay cables as the network
infrastructure already is deployed&mdash;the electrical
grid. Yet, PLC also has strong limitations, such as:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
High attenuation, so it is
efficient only across short distances.
</p></li><li><p>
Impedance changes with power cycles, due to
the presence of nonlinear devices such as diodes and
transformers.
</p></li><li><p>
Occasional impedance changes due
to devices switching on and off.
</p></li><li><p>
Reflections due to the home electrical grid topology.
</p></li><li><p>
Power lines often lacking a ground connection.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
To avoid these problems, HomePlug uses a
robust orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) scheme with 1,280 orthogonal
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) carriers.
Consequently, HomePlug's maximum point-to-point range
is approximately 200 meters.
</p><p>
To extend the range further, we have developed a simple Linux IP
repeater. We have implemented it on both desktops and an embedded
microcontroller-based development card. The latter yields a small, low-consumption,
low-cost device that could be installed easily in any building location.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e3580.0x1adc2c0"></a>
Description of the Repeater</h2></div></div><p>
We divide the network into class C subnets (Figure 2),
such that any two devices within the same subnet see
each other. The devices in a subnet can
communicate without a repeater, so we need it only
when connecting devices in different subnets. A
subset of the devices in any of the two subnets can
see a subset of the devices in the other.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8166f2.large.jpg"><img src="8166f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The IP repeater connects two subnets over HomePlug.
</p></div></div><p>
Let us assume the repeater initially is installed
in parent subnet 192.168.0.X, with address
192.168.0.1 (it could be any address). For any
new subnet 192.168.X.X, we reserve IP address
192.168.X.1 for the repeater gateway. When the
destination IP address of a packet does not belong to
the sender subnet, the repeater routes it. Actually,
the repeater does no routing, as the same
transmission line supports both packet ingress and
egress. Thus, it needs no routing table, and it
simply relays packets by using the same medium.
</p><p>
For the repeater to belong to different
subnets, it must have several IP addresses. In other
words, it is necessary to assign several network
interfaces to its Ethernet card. In the example shown in
Figure 2, the repeater card has two network
interfaces, with respective IP addresses of
192.168.0.1 and 192.168.120.1. In Linux, this is done
as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# ifconfig eth0:0 192.168.0.1
# ifconfig eth0:1 192.168.120.1
</pre>
</p><p>
The number of subnets is unknown beforehand, thus
the repeater must autoconfigure itself. In our
trials, we set its IP address to 192.168.0.1,
as in typical commercial built-in DHCP servers.
</p><p>
We have implemented repeater self-configuration using a
program called hprmanager, now available by e-mail from
<a href="mailto:pedro@det.uvigo.es">pedro@det.uvigo.es</a>. This program sets the Ethernet card to
promiscuous mode and looks for new subnets in order to
register them.
</p><p>
The repeater discovers the subnets it interconnects
by capturing every packet circulating in the network.
In permanent state, even though the Ethernet card is
in promiscuous mode, it does not receive all packets
due to the PLC modem placed between the network
card and the power line (Figure 2). This PLC modem
blocks all packets except those whose destination
address is a broadcast one, a multicast one or
the repeater address itself. However, the repeater
necessarily receives broadcast and multicast packets
from unknown subnets. In any case, it also
is possible to set network interfaces manually.
</p><p>
Each computer must select the gateway in its own
subnet. Assuming we are configuring a computer in
subnet 192.168.0.X, it must set 192.168.0.1 as the
default gateway:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# route add default gw 192.168.0.1
</pre>
</p><p>
To configure the repeater on a desktop Linux machine,
it is necessary to do several things:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Activate the packet forwarding module by adding, for example,
the following line to /etc/sysctl.conf:

<pre     class="programlisting">
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
Assign the default IP address; as previously
stated, the repeater has the address 192.168.0.1.
</p></li><li><p>
Start the repeater manager. Assuming it
resides in /bin/, simply add this line to
/etc/rc.d/rc.local:

<pre     class="programlisting">

/bin/hprmanager &amp;

</pre>
</p></li></ul></div><p>
This procedure works for most Linux distributions. For those
without the /etc/sysctl.conf file&mdash;such as Debian&mdash;it
first is necessary to create a shell script file
(beginning with <tt  >#! /bin/sh</tt>) called
/etc/init.d/local, which includes the line
<tt  >/bin/hprmanager &amp;</tt>. Finally, one should add the
script to the desired run levels, as in:

<pre     class="programlisting">

update-rc.d local start 80 2 3 4 5

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e3580.0x1ad35f8"></a>
&mu;Clinux Version</h2></div></div><p>
Because &mu;Clinux runs on embedded systems, the
settings in the previous section must be active
immediately after the load. The default installation of a &mu;Clinux operating
system does not include the packet relaying module.
Thus, we first must compile a
kernel with packet relaying support, using the following four
configuration steps:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Enabling the IP: advanced router option in
the Networking options section (Figure 3).
</p></li><li><p>
Enabling the /proc filesystem support
option in the Filesystems section.
</p></li><li><p>
Enabling the Sysctl support option in the
General Setup section.
</p></li><li><p>
Using the board shown in Figure 5, we must disable the
hardware byte-swapping support for CS89x0 Ethernet
option in the Ethernet (10 or 100Mbit) section
(Figure 4).
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8166f3.large.jpg"><img src="8166f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 4. Ethernet Card Configuration
</p></div></div><p>
Finally, we make three key steps of the repeater setup
by modifying the initialization script /etc/rc. First, activate
the packet forwarding module shown in line 11 of Listing 1. Second, assign
the default IP address, as shown in line 15. Third, start the repeater
manager, as shown in line 19.

We successfully tested these settings on a Motorola
MC68EZ328 DragonBall microcontroller board (Figure

card and the &mu;Clinux v2.4.24 operating system.

Adding an Internet Connection</h2></div></div><p>
An extended HomePlug network may have an Internet
connection through a modem router. Figure 6
represents this scenario.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8166f6.large.jpg"><img src="8166f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. A Typical Scenario Featuring a Repeater and a
Router with an Internet Connection
</p></div></div><p>
Let us consider the Linux desktop repeater to illustrate a solution to provide
an Internet connection. If the router in the parent subnet has the address
192.168.0.1, it is necessary to assign a different
address to the repeater. Moreover, the routing
tables do change. However, the configuration of the computers in
subnet B is the same. They simply route
Internet-bound packets through the repeater
by first issuing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# route add default gw 192.168.120.1
</pre>
</p><p>
The computers in subnet A route packets
to subnet B through the repeater, and
Internet-bound packets go right through the router.
In them, we must execute the following commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# route add -net 192.168.120.0 netmask
 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.0.2 dev eth0
# route add default gw 192.168.0.1
</pre>
</p><p>
The repeater must route Internet-bound packets
through the router by setting:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# route add default gw 192.168.0.1
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, the router sends packets to subnet B
through the repeater. The configuration procedure
depends on the router model. A typical and easy way
is to log in to the Web-based configuration by
going to the URL http://192.168.0.1 in any Web
browser. Then, it is necessary to add route
192.168.120.0/24 through gateway
192.168.0.2.

Performance Evaluation</h2></div></div><p>
The most interesting result of our testing is, in addition to the
repeater allowing communication beyond the
HomePlug range, that it also enhances communications
when two nodes barely can see each other. This is
because the number of available HomePlug carriers
increases.
</p><p>
For the sake of clarity, we assumed a configuration
without an Internet connection in the parent subnet for our testing. First, we measured the response time and the
throughput between two personal computers in
a three-story building that could not see each other without the
repeater in place. We tested both for UDP and TCP traffic.
We used the Qcheck tool, a network-checking utility from Ixia.
With a desktop-based repeater, we obtained response
times for TCP and UDP traffic of approximately 100ms and
throughput in the range of 2Mbps. This is
realistic performance for medium-sized homes.
</p><p>
In a second test, we inserted the repeater between
two computers that barely could see each other. The
response time for both TCP and UDP doubled when
inserting the repeater (50 to 100ms, approximately).
However, the throughput grew from 1.5Mbps to 2Mbps.
</p><p>
We currently are testing the &mu;Clinux version on
cards with a 100-BaseT Ethernet interface, such as the
&mu;Cdimm ColdFire and the EV-S3C4530, both from
Arcturus Networks.
