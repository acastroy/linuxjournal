With faster cracking programs available, passwords
alone are no longer enough to keep naughty people off of your system.
Use a USB device as a second check.

Two-factor authentication aims to solve the
decades-old problem of password-based attacks, such
as brute-force attacks and key-logging attacks. In
Linux, two-factor authentication can be accomplished
with pam_usb, a PAM module that provides a means by
which you can authenticate against cryptographic tokens
stored on removable media, such as a USB drive.
Through the marvel of PAM's module chaining, this
article walks you through configuring two-factor
authentication.
</p><p>
PAM is short for pluggable authentication modules.
According to the Linux-PAM home page:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
PAM provides a way to develop programs that are
independent of authentication scheme. These programs
need authentication modules to be attached to them
at run time in order to work. Which authentication
module is to be attached is dependent upon the local
system setup and is at the discretion of the local
system administrator.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
pam_usb is a PAM module written by Andrea Luzzardi
that facilitates authentication from removable media,
such as USB devices, based on strong cryptographic
key pairs stored on the drive and on the system
itself. pam_usb is available in source form or
in binary packages for a variety of distributions,
including Debian, Gentoo, Fedora, Mandrake and SUSE.
pam_usb lends itself quite nicely to accomplishing
two-factor authentication, although it can be used as
the sole authentication module.
</p><p>
The term two-factor authentication refers to
authentication being achieved using two
separate and distinct criteria to authenticate a
user's identity: usually this is something the user
knows and something the user has. The something
the user knows, in the configuration we're building,
is the user name and password pair, while the
something the user has is the strong cryptographic
tokens we are going to generate and store on the USB drive.
</p><p>
Strictly speaking, you should be able to accomplish
everything discussed here with any flavor of Linux
that has a working PAM configuration and a 2.4
or newer kernel on a system with a supported USB
controller. You also need a supported USB drive,
the pam_usb module source and a C compiler.
</p><p>
I achieved everything discussed here with a Lexar
128MB Impact USB 1.1 drive on an IBM NetVista with an
Intel 82820 Camino USB controller. It is running Debian 3.0
stable with the stock bf kernel (2.4) and gcc-2.3.
</p><p>
You can check to see if your controller and USB drive
are supported by attaching your USB drive and running
<tt  >lsusb</tt> as root. If your controller and drive are
supported, you should see the drive listed in the
output of <tt  >lsusb</tt>. If it isn't, don't despair; your
distribution may not have auto-loaded the necessary
modules. Consult The USB Guide (see the on-line Resources) for
help getting your USB environment set up. Your PAM
install can be confirmed by checking to see if your
login program is linked against libpam by running
<tt  >ldd /bin/login | grep -i pam</tt> and checking the
output. If login is linked against libpam, your PAM
configuration should be set.
</p><p>
The source for the pam_usb module can be downloaded
from the project site (see Resources). Use any browser
to navigate the Web site and
download the latest source tarball. Remember
where you save the download. When the download
is complete, uncompress the tarball with
<tt  >tar -zxvf pam_usb-X.Y.Z.tar.gz</tt>, where X, Y
and Z are the major, minor and build versions, respectively, of
the particular version of pam_usb you downloaded.
You now should have a pam_usb-X.Y.Z directory, so
<tt  >cd</tt>
into the directory and take a quick peek to make sure
you have some files in the directory.
</p><p>
pam_usb does not have any configure scripts, only a
Makefile, so building is simply a matter of running
<tt  >make</tt> from within the pam_usb-X.Y.Z directory.
If you encounter errors, as I did, you probably are
missing libraries. On my Debian 3.0 stable system, I
was missing the development packages for libncurses5,
libpam0g and libreadline4. Once I installed
the missing libraries, the make completed without
errors. After pam_usb builds, you can install
it with <tt  >make install</tt> as root from within
the pam_usb-X.Y.Z directory.
</p><p>
After the installation is complete, it's time to configure pam_usb.
Configuring pam_usb is a relatively straightforward task that can be
broken in to three broad steps: creating the pam_usb log file, backing
up your existing PAM configuration and installing the new configuration.
</p><p>
Creating the pam_usb log file is a matter of choosing
where to put it and what to call it, as well as creating
the file. My personal preference is to keep all logs
in /var/log, so that's where I set up my pam_usb log
file and that is the location used throughout this
article. Create the log file with <tt  >touch
/var/log/pam_usb.log</tt> as root. Next, set the
ownership of the /var/log/pam_usb.log file to match
the ownership of other files in /var/log, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chown $USER:$GROUP /var/log/pam_usb.log
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x268c580.0x2784ad8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where $USER and $GROUP are the user and group that
own the other files in /var/log. Once the file has
been created and ownership has been set, simply change
the permissions on the file to reflect those of the
other files in /var/log by using this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod 0600 /var/log/pam_usb.log
</pre>
</p><p>
More advanced users may want to configure a log
rotation schedule for the pam_usb.log or even change
the file to be append-only with <tt  >chattr</tt>. Those
options are left as exercises for the reader to explore.
</p><p>
Now that the log file has been set up, we need to
back up the existing PAM configuration files. This is
an important step, so do not skip it. On most
systems, the PAM configuration files are stored in
/etc/pam.d. As root, make a backup copy with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cp -rfp /etc/pam.d ~/pam.d/
</pre>
</p><p>
For testing sake, we are working with the PAM
configuration for su, because it is the easiest
PAM-aware application to test. As a precautionary
method, you should keep a root shell open and
accessible so that if a mistake is
made in configuring pam_usb, you are able to rescue
yourself by overwriting the edited configuration files
with backups from your ~/pam.d. You also need
to know what filesystem is used on the USB drive(s)
you will be configuring. In an ideal world, we can
use mount to do the work for us, provided /mnt/usb
exists and your USB drive is on /dev/sda. Use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/usb
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x268c580.0x2784e48"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and then run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mount | grep usb
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x268c580.0x2784fa8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to see what filesystem is on the drive&mdash;the
filesystem is listed in parentheses at the end
of the line. Most USB drives use the vfat
filesystem and do not have more than one partition.
Thus, they are mountable with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt/usb
</pre>
</p><p>
Our first real step in configuring pam_usb is to alter
the PAM-aware applications' PAM configuration file&mdash;this step is required for each application you
want to use pam_usb to authenticate to. Because we're
working with su for testing purposes, focus only
on the /etc/pam.d/su file. Do not try to configure
every PAM-aware application in a single mass-edit
of your /etc/pam.d directory, or tears and sorrow
surely will be your lot. The files in /etc/pam.d/
correspond to the applications they configure, so if
you were to configure console logins or GNOME
Display Manager logins, you would be concerned with
/etc/pam.d/login and /etc/pam.d/gdm, respectively.
The naming pattern for PAM's configuration files
should be relatively self-evident. So, open
/etc/pam.d/su in your favorite text editor and add
the following line above the pam_unix line:

<pre     class="programlisting">

auth required pam_usb.so fs=vfat check_device=-1 \
  check_if_mounted=-1 force_device=/dev/sda \
  log_file=/var/log/pam_usb.log

</pre>
</p><p>
If you do not include the above line before the
pam_unix line, PAM never reaches the point of
authenticating against the USB device. Instead, it
is satisfied by the authentication that occurs
through pam_unix, and it drops out of the authentication
process.
</p><p>
A few options in the pam_usb
configuration that need further explanation: the
force_device option, the pam_usb mode, the filesystem
of the device and the log file we're going to use.
</p><p>
pam_usb is capable of autodetecting which
USB-attached device houses the authentication keys.
By not specifying the force_device directive, pam_usb
walks through all of the attached devices and looks for
keys matching the specified user name. This is helpful
if the machine has multiple USB devices that are
assigned device names according to the order in which
they were attached&mdash;the first device is /dev/sda,
the second is sdb and so on. If you specify the
force_device directive, you are not able to
authenticate unless your USB drive is assigned the
device name specified in the PAM configuration.
</p><p>
pam_usb supports three modes of operation: unique,
alternative and additional. With unique
mode, you can log in using your USB drive, but
if it's not present it isn't possible to log in.
This is achieved by commenting out pam_unix in
$PAMDIR/login and adding the configuration line above.
The alternative mode allows you to log in simply
by plugging in your USB key. If the key is not
present, the system prompts for a password. This is
accomplished by leaving pam_unix intact, adding
the above configuration line to the PAM configuration
file above the pam_unix entry and changing the <tt  >auth
required</tt> bits of the line to read <tt  >auth
sufficient</tt>. To achieve a true two-factor authentication, you need
to require both the user name/password pair and the
USB key, which is how the configuration above is set.
</p><p>
Andrea Luzzardi also points out an
alternative two-factor authentication that involves
encrypting the private key stored on the USB drive,
after which the key requires a password to be
decrypted and used for authentication. pam_usb is
capable of passing the password provided to PAM
through to decrypt the private key, thus accomplishing
two-factor authentication off of a single user name
and password pair. Furthermore, this is accomplished while not compromising any of the
security benefits of having two-factor authentication.
This method of authentication is contingent on using
the same password for the user account that was used to
encrypt the private key used by pam_usb. To encrypt
the private key used by pam_usb, simply use the usbadm
tool to create the cryptographic token:

<pre     class="programlisting">

usbadm cipher /path/to/usb/filesystem \
username algorithm

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x268c580.0x2785478"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where the options have been specified
according to the usbadm man page under cipher.
</p><p>
The fs= option tells pam_usb what filesystem to
try to use to mount and read the USB drive.
If your users have different filesystems on their USB
drives, you'll have trouble with this. Simply specify
whatever filesystem is used on your USB drives.
</p><p>
Once you've made the configuration changes to su's
PAM configuration, it's time to set up a cryptographic
key pair for each user using the system.
Initially, this is done simply with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
usbadm keygen /path/to/mounted/usb/drive keysize
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x268c580.0x2785688"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where keysize is the size (in bits) of the keys you
want to generate and /path/to/mounted/usb/drive
is the&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;path to the root of your
mounted USB drive. For my setup, I chose a key size
of 4,096 bits, which should be adequate to prevent even
determined brute-force attempts against your key pair.
RSA Labs recommends that DSA keys be no smaller than
2,048 bits, so at a minimum use a 2,048-bit key size. The
usbadm program generates files in the root of
your USB drive called .auth/$USER.$HOST, where $USER
is the user name that executed the usbadm command and
$HOST is the hostname of the machine on which the keys were
generated. A corresponding set of keys
in ~$USER/.auth must be present to authenticate with the USB token.
</p><p>
If a USB drive is lost, as is bound to happen, you
can remove the user's ~/.auth/id_pub file and follow
the instructions above to regenerate the key pair.
Be certain you don't lose root's private keys or
you'll have to boot to safe media, disable two-factor
authentication and go through the whole setup process
again to restore functionality.
</p><p>
Having freshly minted your key pair, you now are
ready to test pam_usb and two-factor authentication
with su. Insert your USB drive and try to <tt  >su</tt>
to a user who has a valid key pair; it's best to test
this from a non-root account. You should be prompted
for your user name as before, but instead of being
prompted for your password immediately, you now should
see a USB error as pam_usb tries to mount
/dev/sda, or whatever base device you told it to try.
Provided pam_usb was able to locate your USB drive,
you should be prompted for the user's password, which
if entered correctly, should result in a shell for
that user account. You can make sure that the two-factor
authentication worked by checking the pam_usb log
file and verifying that somewhere near the last line
is a line that reads <tt  >Access granted</tt>. If you see
that line in the pam_usb.log file, congratulations&mdash;su now is configured to use two-factor authentication.
</p><p>
Once you are satisfied with the functionality of
pam_usb for su, you can duplicate the configuration
for su with other applications that you want to
set up with two-factor authentication. Be sure to
issue all users the necessary keys and thoroughly test
things before you log off the system and/or reboot.
</p><p>
As with any authentication system, two-factor
authentication is not without its weaknesses.
This particular implementation is vulnerable to
private key theft, because it's easy to copy the
contents of the USB drive. In the March 15, 2005,
Crypto-Gram, Bruce Schneier writes a rather scathing
article detailing why two-factor authentication is
not the end-all-be-all of authentication&mdash;the crux
of his point is that people are using two-factor
authentication to achieve things it wasn't meant
to achieve. With that in mind, remember that
two-factor authentication is meant to address
the age-old problems of password-based attacks.
pam_usb achieves that end very well, and if properly
configured, it can effectively improve the security of
a given workstation.
