Departing Editor in Chief Don Marti talks with Doc about Linux as a
better building material, durable free software principles, life beyond
DRM, OpenLDAP, DIY, entrepreneurial IT and other ideas that grew during
Don's tenure with the magazine.

This issue is Don Marti's last one as Editor in Chief. I recruited Don
to the magazine, and I hate to see him go. Don brought an ideal
combination of know-how, commitment, integrity, insight, creativity and
humor&mdash;all of which sustained him through a tough period for <i  >Linux Journal</i>, the computer industry trade press and for the Linux community
as well.
</p><p>
Don was a smart and tough editor. He suggested many of the topics at
which I've become expert. He spiked (that's journal talk for rejected)
more than a few of my pieces, always for good reasons. And he always
pushed me to do better work. I wasn't always happy with that (few
writers are), but I'll always be grateful.
</p><p>
The last time the editorial staff was together, at LinuxWorld Expo in
August 2005, executive editor Jill Franklin gave me a fun assignment:
interview Don. So, with the help of Steve Gillmor (impresario of the
eponymous Gillmor Gang podcast, as well as a veteran producer of
recordings, going back to his days with Firesign Theatre), we recorded
what will surely also be a podcast, timed to come out along with this
magazine.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc Searls: How long has it been?</em></span>
</p><p>
Don Marti: I've been at <i  >Linux Journal</i> since 2000, and I've been
Editor in Chief since 2002.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc Searls: When you came along, it was right when the bubble was
bursting, and you came from VA Linux, which was the largest of the
bubbles.</em></span>
</p><p>
Don Marti: Yes. I jumped off the dot-com bubble right as it was
popping.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc Searls: [laughing] We're at LinuxWorld
(Expo) now, and the whole show was on cocaine back then, in a way. I
mean, it was very high; there was nothing but a weird kind of gassy
optimism.</em></span>
</p><p>
Don Marti: Cocaine plus sushi and leather pants.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc Searls: So, I'm interested in your perspective on what's happened
with Linux over the past four years. What did we understand well in the
first place? What did we never quite understand?</em></span>
</p><p>
Don Marti: Well, Linux made a lot of big promises like every one of the
technologies that touched the dot-com frenzy. Linux was better than most
at delivering on them. And, in the years since the dot-com boom, I think
people have had time to fill in the necessary gaps and move Linux into
more and more niches. Things like logical volume management, for example.
And real-time improvements in Linux, and cleaning up the desktop, and
getting more hardware support&mdash;just checking off those to-do list items,
one at a time.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc Searls: Last night we had this documentation BOF. One of the guys
there said that we've reached the point when it's even possible to put
Linux on a random laptop and there's a fair chance it's going to work
out. A lot of the behind-the-scenes work has made that possible.
</em></span>
</p><p>
Don Marti: One of the factors that helps account
for that is the consolidation in the PC hardware
market. Laptops used to have more weird bastard
spawn hardware in them than they do today. With the
introduction of USB hardware, you have a much smaller
number of actual chips that your drivers have to talk
to. Of course, through the same chips you're talking
to everything in three aisles of the computer store,
but the driver development for supporting all that can
be saner and easier for more people to have a hand in.
</p><p>
When Greg Kroah-Hartman did an article for us on
writing a driver for a multicolor LED blinky light
device that plugs in to the USB port, he got a bunch
of comments on that, including one from a developer
who, before the next article in the series came out,
had written his own USB device driver and gotten it
into the kernel tree.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc Searls: How much have people reading and writing in places like
<i>Linux Journal</i>&mdash;especially <i>Linux Journal</i>&mdash;had an involvement with the
development of Linux?
</em></span>
</p><p>
Don Marti: Greg Kroah-Hartman again is a good example
of that. He's now one of the top kernel people.
Both through work and his own projects, he has
become responsible for more and more of the kernel. He
started off writing for <i  >Linux Journal</i> in 2002. And, as
he's gotten more responsibilities in the kernel, he's
also written more articles for <i  >Linux Journal</i>. Robert
Love is another good example. And outside the kernel,
many, many other contributors have both code that
they maintain that's on the Linux CDs you get at the
store, and also articles that they've written for
<i  >Linux Journal</i>.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc Searls: Yeah, it's always been interesting to
me what role <i>Linux Journal</i> and journals in
general have in a development ecosystem. What do
you see as the future for <i>Linux Journal</i> and for
magazines like that? At this point, it's a tough
time for publications. We seem to have sustained a
complete turnover of advertisers after the dot-com
bubble&mdash;and managed to stay in business. But today
so much more information is available freely on the
Web. And we have a two- or three-month lead time. How can
we stay current?
</em></span>
</p><p>
Don Marti: On the Internet, every movement looks
like a big argument, and one of the things a print
publication can do is pick a side and stand by a
considered opinion. So, when <i  >Linux Journal</i> comes out
against something like proprietary device drivers,
or when <i  >Linux Journal</i> comes out and says that
the directory server is one of the most important
pieces of software in your organization to commit to
open source and open standards, then we can take a
consistent position on something like that and put
together a set of articles that helps people succeed
if they agree with us either in whole or in part.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc Searls: You were involved in our <i>Embedded Linux Journal</i> effort. What's the story with that, and with
embedded in general?
</em></span>
</p><p>
Don Marti: <i  >Embedded Linux Journal</i> was a controlled-circulation publication. And I think the
idea of sending people a paper magazine for free,
and that advertisers will pay to reach them,
is sort of falling apart. I don't know how many
of these controlled-circulation magazines you get,
but it's something where the reader doesn't have a
commitment in time or money to pay attention to this
thing, and it ends up being one of the last things
they get to. So, when <i  >Linux Journal</i> has readers
who are willing to pay for it and subscribe to it,
I think that they're more likely to read it.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc Searls: I'm thinking also of the activity around Embedded Linux. Two
years ago I had people telling me that the telephone OS market was going
to come down to Java and Symbian. Now it's pretty clear Linux is going
to be the big thing there, or one of the big things there.
</em></span>
</p><p>
Don Marti: Java as an application environment is still
thriving on the cell phones. When you get a Linux phone, one of the
features of that is a Java virtual machine, with the ability to install
and run Java applications. But Linux certainly has a huge advantage for
full-featured cell phones in that it's the very first OS that most of
the hardware vendors develop drivers for. So that shortens the
development time for manufacturers who want to get that hardware into a
phone.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc Searls: Most of the developers that we run into at a place like LinuxWorld, or the O'Reilly Open Source Convention, are doing applications
for computers, not necessarily for phones. And phones, even if they
have Linux in them, are still silos. They're still closed things to
some degree. Whereas a server you can make into anything you want it to be.
</em></span>
</p><p>
Don Marti: When you get cell-phone service, they
give you a phone. And free as in cell phones is
not something that I think of as a bargain, because
that phone is strictly controlled by the carrier,
who determines what you can and can't run on it.
Part of that is the carriers' need to conform to
regulations. And part of that is their business
model. They want you to buy applications through
them, rather than being able to download and install
your own.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc Searls: Yeah, they want to enforce behaviors. Like, if you
accidentally took a picture where you have no choice to just discard it,
you have to either send or save. That's what my phone wants me to do.
They get money for that, I assume, or they wouldn't force me to do that.
But there is a sense that there is, for me at least, a kind of a closed
environment. Does it concern you that Linux is often used as the base
operating system in things that are inherently closed, like a TiVo for
example? I mean a TiVo is a sort of a closed environment, and TiVos run
on Linux.</em></span>
</p><p>
Don Marti: A TiVo lawyer told me that the reason they
have to be strict about video extraction is that they
don't want to face a lawsuit from Hollywood. So, if
you download and store a TV program in digital form
on your TiVo, they do everything they can to make
it difficult to get those exact bits off of that
drive. You can record to a VHS tape, but you can't
make a digital copy. And, like most of the other
consumer electronics and IT vendors, I don't think
TiVo is being 100% honest about big, bad Hollywood
making them do this digital rights management. I
think that there's a reason why IT vendors and
consumer electronics vendors want to lock in their
own customers and laying it all on Hollywood is not
going to fly much longer. So, I'm concerned about
devices that have lock-in built in to them, whatever
OS they're on.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc Searls: You've said some interesting things about DRM in the past. For
example, that all DRM is bad. You've gotten some push-back on that, but
I'd like to hear what you mean by DRM being bad.
</em></span>
</p><p>
Don Marti: Cory Doctorow made a great distinction
between DRM and CA or conditional access. When you
sign up for a service and they tell you, &ldquo;You must
log in to view this content&rdquo;, and you log in and then
you can read and view, or cut and paste the information,
that's conditional access. When you get a piece of
content and it says, &ldquo;Cut and paste are disabled&rdquo;,
or &ldquo;Print is disabled&rdquo; or &ldquo;Read aloud is
disabled&rdquo;,
then that's DRM. And DRM is deliberately micromanaging
or removing the value from that information. It breaks
some essential economic relationships that I think
ultimately the authors of that information will be
concerned about.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc Searls: If we had Hollywood executives sitting at this table today,
saying they can't imagine any way other than DRM, what would you tell
them about alternatives to DRM that would get them the same or similar
economic benefit? That it's worth the trade-off?
</em></span>
</p><p>
Don Marti: That's a really good question. I think
that a lot of the understanding that Hollywood has
built up over many years of trying to understand the
Internet is based on sales pitches from vendors who
are pushing DRM systems. So, when a DRM vendor goes
to Hollywood and talks to them about, &ldquo;We can control
this, we can lock out this, this will enable you to
make money&rdquo;, that really shapes the understanding
of somebody who isn't in the technology business
and who doesn't have the technical background. So,
before I start spewing business ideas, I really
want to listen to what the person understood to be
the case about the technology and try to understand
and fill in the gaps where the gaps are.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc Searls: This brings us to the cartelization of
things. DVDs are encrypted, in their own way, because
the cartel didn't want DVDs to run on
any machine other than what they controlled or where
they had a relationship. DVDs will run on Windows,
on a Mac, but not on a Linux machine.
</em></span>
</p><p>
Don Marti: And there were other business-model-related restrictions
that were built into the DVD format. For example, region coding.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc Searls: I never understood why region encoding was there. I mean,
it's a hassle that doesn't seem to have an upside to me.
</em></span>
</p><p>
Don Marti: Well, imagine if a studio wants to release
a movie on DVD in the US, when that move has not yet
had its theatrical release in Europe. So, if they did
not have the region coding system, then somebody might
buy the DVD in the US and take it over to Europe and
watch it and interfere with what has always been a classic
Hollywood business model: show it in the theaters
first, then wait a while, make it unavailable at
all, and then release it on VHS and now DVD. And,
interestingly enough, that model is being collapsed.
Before the DVD format was decrypted, it was about a
year from US theatrical release to DVD release, and
within the past year or two, it's come down to about
half a year. Hollywood wants to be able to play with
business models, change who can see what when. So I
think there is tremendous appeal that the DRM vendors
are offering, saying, &ldquo;We can control your audience,
we can control the technology so that it fits with
the business model that you want to try this year.&rdquo;
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc Searls: I became familiar a few months ago
with Lucene. Doug Cutting who used to work at Excite, felt that keyword
search was a done science, essentially. The result is some open code
that anybody could use. Now anybody can do keyword search. Lucene
isn't even a full product. It's one piece of building material. Last
night we talked about Struts, which is another one of those kind of things.
It's been sitting out there. So, one concern that I have is that Linux,
as it becomes more like a foundation stone, disappears. It turns into
the building, it becomes rebar and cinder block. Does that concern
you? Or is that just a natural course of things? Should we pay less
attention to Linux after a certain point and to the general construction
business that Linux is a part of?
</em></span>
</p><p>
Don Marti: I think there are some lessons to be drawn
from the history of the projects that are older than
Linux and possibly more mature, as products,
than Linux. And a good example would be GCC.
</p><p>
GCC for a long time was considered to be a good,
stable compiler, capable of doing code for almost
any processor out there. And, within the past few
years, with a lot of the changes in the processor
architectures and optimizations you can do for
processors such as the Opteron, the need for ripping
up and redoing parts of GCC has popped up. And, with
things like the C++ standard template library, there's
pressure on GCC on the language side as well. So, GCC
is a piece of software that sits between the languages
and the hardware. GCC was a stable, mature project,
but as languages become more complex, and the number
of languages people want to code in increases, and
at the same time the hardware gets capable of doing
hairier and faster things, then a mature piece of
structure needs to have changes happen to it.
</p><p>
The same thing is going to happen with Linux, as
hardware advances and the OS needs to be able to
support more processors or processors in unusual
configurations, such as the very many processors
in a newer machine, or situations when you might
have some processors on one die and some processors
on another die, and the OS needs to be aware of
which processors are where. As the hardware changes,
the OS will need to advance, and as the applications
that demand services from the OS change, the OS will
need to advance. So, Linux won't entirely fade into
the background unless hardware stops changing and the
applications stop changing the way in which they use
the kernel.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc Searls: Since we're on GCC, I know you're one
of the folks who has a deep appreciation of Richard
Stallman's role. I'm wondering....We've kind of
gone back and forth on calling Linux &ldquo;GNU/Linux&rdquo;
as Richard would like us to, and just Linux. Do you
have a particular feeling about that?
</em></span>
</p><p>
Don Marti: The official <i  >Linux Journal</i> policy on it is, &ldquo;Leave it the way
the author wrote it.&rdquo; If someone wants to make clear in his or her article
that the whole system is called GNU/Linux, then we leave that stand. If
the author wants to say, &ldquo;The name of my system is, say, Red Hat
Linux&rdquo;, that doesn't have GNU in its name and so we leave that
name as it stands in the original article.
</p><p>
Where GNU comes in as an absolutely key project is
as a many-year development effort to bring together
a system that lets people do what they need to do, to
communicate, to get by in the world of computers. As
Richard Stallman himself put it, &ldquo;So that I can
continue to use computers without dishonor.&rdquo;
</p><p>
And, the idea that when you click OK on that end-user license agreement,
you say, &ldquo;It is OK that I
won't examine this piece of information that I have
downloaded. It's OK that I agree not to change it or
understand how it works, or explain it to someone
else how it works.&rdquo; I've come to understand that I
don't believe that. And, I've come to a lot of
that understanding through what Richard has written
about the subject.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc Searls: To me what's so interesting about Linux and about the Free
Software movement&mdash;and to the understanding of computing and software
that goes back to the earliest days of independent computing&mdash;is what
Richard was saying about the nature of software in the first place: that
it was inherently free and wanted to be free more or less the way the
wood and the pine tree wants to be free. He wasn't just talking about
the economic uses of it; he was talking about the nature of the thing
itself. And the feeling I have is that this is still not fully
understood. Is that your sense as well?
</em></span>
</p><p>
Don Marti: Well, my sense of software is that
it's something that is both speech and a device,
depending on how you define it. When you talk about
software as speech, many good things tend to flow
from that. When you use software as a device you
can get into great benefits and also fairly scary
issues. So, the challenge is to apply the best of
what our culture has developed for the real world to
the world of software.
</p><p>
On both sides of the software freedom debate, people
try to make analogies comparing software to real-world items. So when Bob Young says, &ldquo;You wouldn't
buy a car with the hood welded shut&rdquo;, he's trying to
make an analogy to a real-world object. When someone
on the restrictive side of the debate says, &ldquo;Well,
you wouldn't walk into a store and walk out with
a copy of the CD&rdquo;, this person is also trying to make an
analogy to a real-world item. It's a huge issue to
understand the best of what we value about
real-world goods and translate those values to the
software world and the on-line world.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc Searls: As you know, I've been fascinated by the parallels between
the construction industry and computing in general, including the
software industry. In construction there is a very mature understanding of how
things work together. Now, we've been sitting in this building. I'm sure
this floor is a synthetic material and there is clearly some kind of
sedimentary rock that's a surface over there, and behind you there is
the huge corpse of a trunk of what appears to be a eucalyptus tree. It's
not structural; it just graces the place as an architectural element.
There's steel and terrazzo over here. So one of the things that
fascinates me about construction is that it's full of open source. I
mean, there are no secrets to making terrazzo. Yet there's still what we
call intellectual property in construction. But none of it is in
position to take control over everything else. I'm looking at a door
over there. It's probably a standard door, but the latch on it may have
some patents in it, and it may have a lock in it and that lock may have
some patents as well. But you can replace that lock, right? And, I'm
wondering if you can see a path toward that. I don't think
we're at that point in software yet, where we have that same sense of
modularity. Do you see us getting toward something like that in
software? What might Linux have to say about that, being something like
a natural material?
</em></span>
</p><p>
Don Marti: So far, the proprietary software vendors have really dropped
the ball. On the free software side, Richard Stallman with the GPL has
come out with a normative statement of a code of conduct for software
developers and users. When someone releases software under the GPL,
or chooses software under the GPL, the person is agreeing to those
norms. If you want to talk about proprietary software becoming part
of a mature market, or becoming a part of the useful structure, then
there has to be some norm other than &ldquo;all your base are belong to
us&rdquo;.
</p><p>
When you look at Larry Ellison's licenses saying,
&ldquo;Thou shalt not publish benchmarks and you have to
click on this to agree to that&rdquo;, that's not compatible
with building a useful structure out of multiple
materials or under multiple licenses. That's a
trailer-park landlord's idea of city planning. So,
really, when the proprietary software license writers
decide to put as much thought in their licenses as
Richard Stallman and Eben Moglen and the rest of
the free software side have put into theirs, then we
have some potential for that kind of innovation and
growth. Until that happens, I think those who want to
treat software as a mature product and a responsible
market are not going to have much choice except for
the free software side. So show me a responsible,
innovation-compatible and integration-compatible
proprietary software license and we'll see what
happens.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc Searls: In looking back over your five years or so with <i>Linux Journal</i>, what great articles or achievements stand out for you?
</em></span>
</p><p>
Don Marti: I'm very proud that we did our 2.6 kernel
preview very early in the 2.6 cycle, when it was still
2.5 development. That was when we let people who were
doing Linux deployments and applications know, &ldquo;Look,
here's the great stuff coming along in the kernel.&rdquo;
That issue [May 2003] with Robert Love wearing headphones and
the headline, &ldquo;Are You Ready to Rock?&rdquo;, that was the
right issue at the right time to give 2.6 testing
a nice kick. And, one article that I was so happy
about that I had the authors do another version of
essentially the same idea, was Craig Swanson and Matt
Lung's &ldquo;OpenLDAP Everywhere&rdquo; [December 2002 and July 2005]. That company brought
together the complete directory of services for all
their clients, both Microsoft Windows and Linux,
authenticating against it, sharing address books,
using the file server and the intranet servers in a
very compatible and customer-directed way. So, we,
Doc, you and I talked about this, and came up with the
idea of DIY-IT&mdash;largely influenced by a small company.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc Searls: I get a lot of credit for that, but that
really came from you. There's the notion of smart companies using Linux
to make themselves smarter. That was an assignment that really became my
mission with the magazine. The observation that everything that happens
with Linux starts with smart individuals doing smart stuff, usually
without big vendor assistance. I'm not knocking big vendors at all, it's
just that DIY-IT acknowledges that they're part of the ecology, not
the origin of the ecology.
</em></span>
</p><p>
Don Marti: And when the vendor says, &ldquo;there is no
market for that yet&rdquo;, that's something the
customers should hear as &ldquo;your competitors aren't
doing that yet&rdquo;. I think the next step, beyond DIY, is
entrepreneurial IT. Where can you take those building
blocks that are becoming large enough, stable enough,
functional enough that you can get a lot of business
value with very little integration work and staff
time? How can you take those things and as an IT
department create business value?
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc Searls: I need to wrap this up by saying that I've been around
<i>Linux Journal</i> from the beginning&mdash;and this is not a knock at
any editors&mdash;but as far as I am concerned, you're the best editor we've ever had and
it's been an honor to work with you.
