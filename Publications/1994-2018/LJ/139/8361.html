The Happy Hacking Keyboard Professional (HHKB Pro) is a compact USB
keyboard with an excellent feel, some intriguing features and a hefty
price tag. It's made by PFU, part of the Fujitsu Corporation.
</p><p>
The most important thing about any keyboard is this: how well does it work
for typing? Although the HHKB Pro has fewer keys than a normal keyboard
has,
the keys it does have are full size and are mostly where your fingers expect
to find them. The keys have an excellent feel too, clicking gently when you
type but not clacking loudly. I find that I can touch-type at full
speed with this keyboard. In fact, I wish my full-size keyboard had
keys this nice.
</p><p>
Earlier keyboards in the Happy Hacking keyboard line have membrane keys
with rubber caps. The HHKB Pro, however, has a circular cone spring
system. According to the Happy Hacking Web site, this system provides
softer keystrokes and a longer keyboard life.
</p><p>
As with many laptop keyboards, the HHKB Pro has a Fn key (for Function)
that can combine with other keys to make a keystroke that is not otherwise
available. The HHKB Pro, with only 60 keys, doesn't have dedicated
function keys; but you can get an F1 keystroke with Fn-1, F12 with Fn-=
and so on. This keyboard doesn't even have dedicated arrow keys; up,
down, left and right are, respectively, Fn-[, Fn-/, Fn-; and Fn-'.
</p><p>
The HHKB Pro has the Esc and Ctrl keys in the traditional places.
The most common keyboard layout today is the 104-key layout, based on
the 101-key layout that IBM introduced in 1986. 104-key keyboards have
a Caps Lock key to the left of the ASDF home row of keys and have two
Ctrl keys, on opposite sides of the keyboard. The HHKB Pro has a
single Ctrl key instead of a Caps Lock key; Fn-Tab serves as the Caps
Lock key. A 104-key layout keyboard has the Esc key widely separated
from the rest of the keyboard, at the extreme upper left. The HHKB Pro
places the Esc key immediately above the Tab key and to the left of
the 1 key.
</p><p>
The HHKB Pro also has a set of DIP switches that can be used to customize
the way the keyboard works. These are located behind a small cover on the back
side of the keyboard.
</p><p>
The SW1 and SW2 DIP switches select among three modes: default or HHK
mode, HHK Lite mode and Macintosh mode. The only difference between
the default mode and HHK Lite mode is some additional key
combinations become available in HHK Lite mode. For example, you cannot
use the Fn-Tab combination for Caps Lock in default mode; HHK Lite mode
enables it. I can see no reason why anyone would prefer the default
mode to the HHK Lite mode, and I recommend you use HHK Lite mode if you
use an HHKB Pro keyboard.
</p><p>
Immediately above the Return key is a key labeled Delete. The
SW3 DIP switch, when on, changes this to make it work as a Backspace key.
Whether or not SW3 is on, Fn-Delete always works as a Backspace key, and Fn-`
always works as a Delete key.
</p><p>
Two Alt keys are present, to the left and right of the spacebar. There
also are two keys labeled with diamonds; these can be used as the
logo keys from a 104-key keyboard. The SW5 DIP switches can be used to
swap the functions of Alt and diamond keys. If you frequently use Alt
keys&mdash;for example, if you use Emacs and Alt is your meta
key&mdash;you probably will prefer this. The diamond keys are bigger and easier to
press.
</p><p>
The SW4 DIP switch controls whether the left diamond key works as a
logo key or as a second Fn key. If SW5 is enabled, making the left Alt
key work as a logo key, the left Alt key becomes be the second Fn key.
</p><p>
The last DIP switch, SW6, controls whether the keyboard goes to sleep
when the computer does. Fn-Esc makes a keystroke called
Power that can be used to control a PC's sleep mode. I didn't test
this feature, though.
</p><p>
The HHKB Pro also has a few multimedia key combinations: volume down,
volume up, mute and eject are, respectively, Fn-A, Fn-S, Fn-D and Fn-F.
However, these are supported only when the HHKB Pro is in Macintosh
mode. In the other two modes, holding down the Fn key does not change
the keystrokes these keys make. If you want the multimedia keys to work,
you could try setting the keyboard to Macintosh mode, and in your desktop
environment's keyboard preferences set your keyboard type to Macintosh. I tried this and it worked for me. The HHKB Pro even
generated the same multimedia keystrokes as my other keyboard, so both
keyboards could be used to adjust the volume of my speakers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d0580.0x21c9108"></a>
Daily Use</h2></div></div><p>
When you first use the HHKB Pro, the first thing you notice is the
lack of dedicated arrow keys. Anytime you need an arrow key, you
have to press a Fn-&lt;key&gt; combination. What's worse is the arrow
keys are not immediately obvious; you need to take your hand off
the keyboard, look at it, press the combination and then put your hand back
for more typing. If you use the HHKB Pro long enough, though, you
probably can learn to press the Fn combinations for the arrow keys without
looking. But this simply is not as convenient as having dedicated arrow keys.
</p><p>
However, Linux builds on a long UNIX tradition, and UNIX was developed
on many different terminals that had many different keyboards. As a
result, both Emacs and vi are designed to be usable with only standard
ASCII keys. In my college days, I used to write Pascal programs on ADM3A
terminals that didn't even have a dedicated Backspace key; you had to
press Ctrl-H when you wanted a backspace. If you can learn to use Emacs or
vi keystrokes, you can get by fine without using arrow keys, and
there are many programs in Linux that use these keystrokes.
</p><p>
I configured my bash shell to use vi keystrokes for command-line
editing and quickly became comfortable with it. See the sidebar for notes
on using vi or Emacs mode in the shell.
</p><p>
Actually, I'm kicking myself now that I didn't set my shell for vi mode
long ago. Because I'm expert with vi, I can edit command lines much better
in vi mode, without taking my hands from the home row keys. If you
have spent time mastering either vi or Emacs, try them in the
shell!
</p><p>
If you have a small laptop or a tablet PC, the HHKB Pro makes an
excellent carry-along keyboard. If you pack the HHKB Pro into a bag, I
recommend you fully unplug the USB cable. The HHKB Pro's cable is a
standard USB cable with an A connector on one end and a mini-B connector
on the other.

Price</h2></div></div><p>
Unfortunately, the HHKB Pro is rather expensive. The Web site lists the
regular price as $269. I searched the Web and was able to find the
HHKB Pro for as little as $249, which is still much more than I am
willing to pay for a keyboard.
</p><p>
The Happy Hacking Keyboard Lite 2 model, in USB or in PS/2, is available
for a regular price of $69.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
If it were not for the price, I wholeheartedly would recommend the HHKB
Pro. It's everything you could ask for in such a compact keyboard.
Of course I'm using it to type this article, and I'm enjoying the smooth
feel of the keys. It is nicer than my usual keyboard, but alas it costs
more than six times as much.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d0580.0x21c95d8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
vi or Emacs Mode in the Shell
</b></p><p>
By default, the bash shell already should be in Emacs mode. You can use
Ctrl-P and Ctrl-N instead of the up and down arrow keys to scroll through
the command history. You can use other Emacs keystrokes to edit command lines.
</p><p>
To make bash use vi keys, edit a file called .inputrc in your home
directory and insert these lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
set editing-mode vi
set keymap vi-insert
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, start up a fresh bash shell and try it out. If
you press the Esc key, you enable editing mode,
where hjkl keys work as left, down, up and right
arrow keys. Other vi commands, including ^ for
jump to start of line and $ for jump to end of line,
also work.
</p><p>
If your system defaults to vi and you want Emacs mode, insert these
lines in your .inputrc file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
set editing-mode emacs
set keymap emacs
</pre>
</p><p>
These features come courtesy of the GNU Readline Library. For more
information on Readline and its features, run <tt  >man 3
readline</tt>
or check the Readline Web site (<a href="http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html" target="_self">cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html</a>).
</p><p>
Not only bash but any program that uses the GNU Readline
Library can be customized by making changes to your .inputrc file.
For example, the GDB debugger uses Readline.
</p><p>
If you use the tcsh shell, again Emacs mode is available by default. You
can set vi editing mode by placing this line in your .tcshrc file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bindkey -v
</pre>
</p><p>
Read the tcsh man page for more information.
</p><p>
If you use the zsh shell, all you have to do is set the EDITOR or VISUAL
environment variable to your favorite editor. If your choice contains
the string &ldquo;vi&rdquo;, zsh sets vi mode; otherwise it defaults to
Emacs mode. You also directly can manage the editing mode with zsh's
<tt  >bindkey</tt> command. See the zsh man page for more information.
</p><p>
Even the Midnight Commander (mc) file manager supports Emacs-style
command-line editing as well as Emacs-like and vi-like key bindings
in its file viewer.
