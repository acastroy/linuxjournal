Create a master hack by bringing the
power of Linux to the ultimate electronic toy.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x162c580.0x17242f0"></a></h2></div></div><p> An old electronic pinball
machine is fascinating because it embodies complexity
just within the grasp of a jack-of-all-trades
hacker. You can learn how one works by visiting
the open-source repository known as the US Patent
and Trademark Office. The Bally Manufacturing
Corporation used a system built around its AS2518
Microprocessor Unit (MPU) described by US Patent
4,198,051 in more than 350,000 units from 1977 to
1985. Maybe you remember playing <span   class="emphasis"><em>Evel
Knievel</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>KISS</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mata Hari</em></span> or
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Space Invaders</em></span>?
</p><p>
At the moment, you can buy most nonworking games for
less than $250. Many come with original documentation
that includes circuit schematics. Combined with
what you can learn from the patents and other
publications, plus your knowledge of PC hardware and
free, open-source software, you can hack together
something unique: a working, Web-enabled, classic
pinball machine that plays by your rules, running
your programs. You can do it legally, for less than
the cost of a replacement MPU board, with an old PC
and a stock Linux distribution like Fedora.
</p><p>
Reverse engineering the AS2518 MPU was the
subject of my Master's thesis in Industrial
Technology. Nonworking games often suffer the
same tragic design flaw we see on old computer
motherboards. Figure 1 shows the damage caused by a
leaking Ni-Cad battery that was soldered directly onto
the MPU. It ruins not only the electrical connections
in IC sockets, but also corrodes the wiring harnesses
joining the MPU to the rest of the system.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8476f1.large.jpg"><img src="8476f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Corrosion on an AS2518 MPU Board
</p></div></div><p>
The other circuit boards are usually still
intact. When you start working on your game, check the
voltages at the test points to make sure. I chose to
neuter the flaky +5 VDC circuit altogether and use
the power supply from the PC. With the MPU removed,
you are left with four wire harnesses holding a total of 66
wires. To connect your PC to the pinball machine, you
will want to build an interface board with matching
header pins. The design goal is to produce the same
inputs and outputs on all of the wires that the original
MPU has. This may seem like an overwhelming task,
but remember, this is 1980s-era technology. I used an
iterative, divide, design, build and test approach
to reverse engineer one subsystem at a time.
</p><p>
What differentiates this project from the typical
emulator is that no reference is made to the
original programs encoded on the MPU firmware.
Instead, I employed a black box, or clean
room, method based on studying their function rather
than their internal structure. For me, it made sense
to interpret these 66 electrical connections in terms
of their purpose in a closed-loop process control
model. That is, each is either input, output, part of
a feedback circuit or part of the power supply. The
four main divisions of the pinball machine control
system are the solenoids, switch matrix, feature
lamps and digital displays. I intentionally left
out the digital displays for the first prototype,
which is why the apparatus uses the computer monitor
to show the scores. The analysis yielded the process
model shown in Figure 2.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8476f2.large.jpg"><img src="8476f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

The Hardware, Part I: the I/O Board</h2></div></div><p>
Facing a total of 11 inputs and 20 outputs,
and wanting room to grow, I decided to build a 48-port
digital I/O board. Designs can be found with a little
Web searching, and the components can be ordered from
Jameco. The Intel 8255 Parallel Peripheral Interface
(PPI) integrated circuit provides two 8-bit ports
and two 4-bit ports, each configurable as either
input or output. On my board, I hard-wired two of these
ICs to addresses 0x280-0x283 and 0x2A0-0x2A3. The
first three bytes of each are memory-mapped to the
aforementioned ports. The fourth byte is used to
control the port settings. I used a ten-foot piece
of 25-pair twisted pair cable to connect it to the
interface board via screw terminals. It's definitely
a hack, as Figure 3 illustrates. You may want to use
a 50-conductor SCSI cable and header pins.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8476f3.large.jpg"><img src="8476f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

The Hardware, Part II: the Interface Board</h2></div></div><p>
The AS2518 MPU is based on the Motorola 6800
microprocessor. It uses two 6820 Peripheral Interface
Adapters (PIAs) to provide I/O to the rest of the
system. The Intel 8255s are functionally similar. What
must be duplicated on the interface board are the
circuit elements between the PIA I/O lines and the
header pins. These are determined through direct
inspection and study of the electrical schematics
accompanying the patents and the operator manuals, and
consist mainly of resistors and capacitors. A picture
of the board I created is shown in Figure 4. A label
maker works great for marking wires and connectors.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8476f4.large.jpg"><img src="8476f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

The Software, Part I: Basic Operation</h2></div></div><p>
First, I tried to make the control system work as
an ordinary user-space program. Using the method
of divide and conquer, the simplest subsystem
of the pinball machine to hack is the continuous
solenoids. They are either on or off for long periods
of time. On my game, I implemented only the flipper
relay, which is turned on during normal game play
and off when the game is over or tilted so that the
flipper buttons don't do anything. This operation was
easily accomplished by a variation of a C program I wrote
to test the I/O board. According to the schematic,
the flipper relay is enabled by making its output low
rather than high. This is known as negative logic. I
quickly learned something about the PC architecture:
even with a pull-up resistor, the port is in a low
state from the moment the computer is powered up. This
had the unintended result of turning on the flippers
before the control program was even started. To work
around it, I added a 7404 inverter to the interface
board. Now the flippers are enabled when the output
is set high.
</p><p>
Next, in order of complexity, comes control of the
momentary solenoids. These are things like the pop
bumpers, chimes, slingshots, saucers and the outhole
kicker that are fired for brief bursts throughout
the game. The Bally documentation states most are
energized for a period of 26 milliseconds; some,
like the drop target reset, for twice as long. To
fire one of 16 possible solenoids, five output
lines are used to drive a 74LS154 decoder on the
solenoid driver board. Four lines provide the binary
representation of the desired solenoid, and one
line enables or disables the decoder outputs. Each
output in turn drives one of the 16 momentary
solenoids.
</p><p>
Like the continuous solenoids, the 74LS154
enable uses negative logic. Programming this action
seems simple. Start with the enable high. Output the
four-bit solenoid number, set the enable low for the
desired duration, then set it high again. Actually, this creates a problem that challenges the ability
of an ordinary Linux user process to behave in real
time. You cannot depend on usleep(26000)
to produce a 26-millisecond delay precisely; it may
and often does yield a longer delay, as the man page
warns. Leaving a solenoid enabled for much longer than
100 milliseconds can damage it and blow the fuse. One
option discussed in the Port Programming HOWTO is
using multiple outb() calls, because each one
takes approximately a microsecond to execute. However,
this amounts to a colossal waste of CPU time spent
in a busy loop.
</p><p>
The prospects for a user-space control process
diminished even more as I began to implement the
switch matrix. The Bally documentation explains that
once every 8.3 milliseconds a snapshot of the switch
matrix is created and then analyzed for changes,
such as when the pinball strikes one of the many
switches on the play field. It is a matrix because
40 separate switches are wired into five rows of
eight columns apiece. The rows are outputs and the
columns are inputs. A logical high is output to the
first row, also referred to as strobing the row. After
a brief delay to allow the voltage to be detected
at the other end of the circuit, an input operation
reads the eight, single-bit columns as one byte of
data. Then the process repeats for the next row,
and so on.
</p><p>
Here is where the real-time requirements become
critical for correct game operation. If an adequate
delay is not created between the row strobe and
the column input, you get garbage; the game's
closed-loop feedback system fails. If too much time
elapses between each sample, such as while the process
is swapped out by the scheduler, a switch closure
might be missed. The challenge of ensuring that the
control process executes at a high frequency (120
Hertz) led me away from user space to the kernel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x162c580.0x1725210"></a>
The Software, Part II: the Kernel Module</h2></div></div><p>
The module I wrote is based on the examples given in
the excellent tutorial
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide</em></span>. Every
kernel module requires an initialization function that
is called when the module is installed via
insmod. This is where I write out the control words to
the two 8255 PPIs defining which ports are for input
and which are for output. Here is also a good place to
register a character device file, which is a simple
means to communicate between kernel space and user
space. I created one called /dev/pmrek.
</p><p>
To turn this module into a periodic process, I declared a workqueue for it. Workqueues are a new feature of the 2.6 kernel. The function in my device driver I want to call with the workqueue is pmrek_process_io(). The workqueue is defined at the global level of the module code with the statements:

<pre     class="programlisting">
static struct workqueue_struct * pmrek_workqueue;
static struct work_struct pmrek_task;
static
DECLARE_WORK(pmrek_task, pmrek_process_io, NULL);
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, in the module initialization function pmrek_init(), create the workqueue with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pmrek_workqueue = create_workqueue(pmrek_WORKQUEUE);
</pre>
</p><p>
This does not actually schedule the workqueue
yet. That happens when the supervisory program
activates it. Figure 5 is a flowchart of the
low-level hardware I/O operations performed by
pmrek_process_io().
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8476f5.large.jpg"><img src="8476f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Kernel Workqueue Process Flowchart
</p></div></div><p>
The first thing it does is read in the switch columns
using inb(). If there are any valid switch
detections, they are written to a log buffer. This
log buffer is consumed by the supervisory process,
and game play advances depending on the switches
detected. Switch detections are stamped with the exact
time they occurred by getting the CPU Real Time Stamp
Counter (RTSC) via the inline assembly command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
__asm__ volatile (".byte 0x0f, 0x31" : "=A" (cpu_time));
</pre>
</p><p>
This sets cpu_time to the number of CPU
machine cycles that have occurred since booting. It is
handy for precise timing measurements. Some switches,
such as the pop bumpers and slingshots, require an
immediate solenoid response.
</p><p>
Next, any enqueued commands are executed
in order by calling the function
pmrek_process_commands(). Commands can be sent from
the supervisory program by writing to
/dev/pmrek, or they can originate in the module
itself. If a momentary solenoid is to be fired, the
four-bit solenoid number is output using
outb(). Then the enable output is set high to turn
on the 74LS154 decoder output. The enable duration is
kept by a counter that is decremented by the workqueue
process delay, which is three milliseconds. Thus,
a 26-millisecond solenoid pulse will take eight
workqueue cycles before the enable bit is set low
again to turn it off.
</p><p>
Next, the control process services the feature
lamps. The AS2518 architecture includes a lamp driver
board populated with 60 silicon controlled rectifiers
(SCRs) to turn on or off individual
light bulbs selectively on the play field and back box. Like
the momentary solenoids, these SCRs are driven by
decoders that take a four-bit input and turn on one
of 16 outputs. To handle all 60 feature lamps,
there are four decoders. The control program steps
through the 16 positions and selectively turns
on any of the four lamps associated with it. All of
this must be done at the beginning of every cycle of
the 120-Hertz, rectified DC power supply waveform. On
the AS2518, this is accomplished using an interrupt
triggered by a power supply zero-crossing detector. I
decided not to use an interrupt. Instead, I employed a
&ldquo;shotgun&rdquo; method by executing the control process
at double this rate or faster, ensuring that the SCRs
are triggered every cycle.
</p><p>
The last I/O operation performed by the workqueue
process is to output the next row strobe for the
next reading of the switch matrix. Then the process
reschedules itself by issuing the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">

queue_delayed_work(pmrek_workqueue,
                   &amp;pmrek_task,
                   pmrek_i.workqueue_delay);

</pre>
</p><p>
The data structure pmrek_i contains all
sorts of information about the pinball control system,
including its workqueue delay, which has a value of
3. The kernel timer runs at 1,000Hz and is the
heartbeat of the kernel. The workqueue delay
is the number of beats before the delayed work is
executed. Using this mechanism, frequencies much
higher than what can be scheduled for ordinary user
processes outside the kernel can be achieved, and
they are more efficient in terms of the resources
they use each time they execute.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x162c580.0x17259f8"></a>
The Software, Part III: Supervisory Control</h2></div></div><p>
Not everything in the pinball machine control system
has to execute as frequently as the low-level
hardware I/O operations. Game play itself&mdash;how the
machine responds to switch detections, lighting
different lamps and incrementing the player
scores&mdash;operates just fine as an ordinary user
process. In a sense, it is really a supervisory
controller of the low-level I/O processing.
</p><p>
The kernel module should work for every game based
on the AS2518 MPU. You can download the source
code from the Pinball Machine Reverse-Engineering
Kit Project on SourceForge.net and compile it for
your kernel. It will then be up to you to write the
supervisory control software to play the particular
game you are hacking. Table 1 lists other source code
files in this package.

You are free to modify the C program
testbed.c I wrote for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Evel
Knievel</em></span>. It uses the ncurses screen handling
package to provide a console color display and user
input. A diagnostic display shows the disposition of
the switch matrix, the lamps and the most recently
fired solenoid. It also shows the player scores,
as well as run-time statistics such as the average
cycle frequency and execution time of the kernel
workqueue process. Keyboard commands can be entered
to turn the continuous solenoid on or off, fire
momentary solenoids, turn feature lamps on or off
and adjust the workqueue delay. Figure 6 shows a game
in progress. Note the closed switches; these are drop
targets that have been struck.

The supervisory program receives events passed from
the kernel module by reading /dev/pmrek,
which it has opened using the system call
open(), just like any other file. Commands are then
sent back to the module by writing to it. I tried to
make the main functions correspond to my impression of
the key events in a game of pinball. They are listed
in Table 2.

You should be able to adapt this code to your
particular game by tweaking the functions
game_switch_response() and
game_lamp_update(). How do you write the program
without peeking at the original manufacturer's source
code? There are plenty of clues painted on the
play field itself, telling you what each switch
scores and so on. Of course, you also can create
your own rules, perhaps improving on weaknesses in
the original design.
</p><p>
The diagnostic display is great for testing, but the
player scores are too small. By default, the console
simulates the large digital displays on the original
back box, as shown in Figure 7. You can get to the
diagnostic display by pressing the Self Test switch
inside the pinball machine coin door.

We took the game to Pinball at the Zoo in Kalamazoo,
Michigan in April 2005. Hundreds of people played the
game, which collected statistical data that I used in
my Master's thesis. After each game completes, a PHP
program reads through the log file created by the game
program. It generates an HTML document summarizing
the event history of the game and statistics about
its real-time performance. These results are then
stored in a MySQL database to facilitate analysis of
overall performance. Figure 8 is a block diagram of
the setup. Figure 9 shows the game in action.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This project is a success story for the Linux 2.6
kernel. It demonstrates that a complex, real-time
process control application can be created using a
kernel workqueue instead of a complicated hardware
interrupt or an additional, real-time package like
RTLinux. Furthermore, through the choice of a pinball
machine, a jack-of-all-trades hacker can produce
something truly useful and fun to play.
