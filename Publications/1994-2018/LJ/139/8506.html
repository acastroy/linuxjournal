<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #139, November 2005</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> has put together a
<span   class="bold"><b>git</b></span> repository
for the full 2.6 tree, going all the way back to
the introduction of BitKeeper. Kernel development
still takes place on a new tree, but the old tree
now exists for reference or for any other purpose
one might have. This is not the first time these
patches have been incorporated into a git repository,
but with all the work going into git during the last
three months, this is the first time a git repository
for these patches has been small enough to fit in a
reasonable space. The progress git has made since its
inception has been utterly amazing, and a 1.0 release
is apparently imminent. Although people will want their
favorite revision control feature
in git before they'll start using it, these features can, for the most
part, all be regarded as icing on the
cake. The core functionality, the stuff that controls
distributed development, exists in a robust, powerful
form for the very first time in a free project.
</p><p>
It looks as though <span   class="bold"><b>RelayFS</b></span> will soon be going into the main
kernel tree. It's had a long stint in <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew
Morton's -mm tree</b></span>,
and it has needed no major fixes in months. A good crop of users has found
it useful for a variety of applications, and the only real objection to
its ultimate inclusion has been the fact that <span   class="bold"><b>DebugFS</b></span> performs
a similar function. But if for no other reason, a filesystem called
DebugFS just doesn't seem to invite users to use it for anything other
than debugging. Andrew has expressed a clear willingness to push the
RelayFS code up to Linus Torvalds, especially as the RelayFS developers
themselves feel the time is right.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Timothy R. Chavez</b></span> and others have produced a patch to enhance the
<span   class="bold"><b>Virtual Filesystem</b></span> (VFS) auditing support to be able to audit a filesystem
object based on its location and name. In the current VFS implementation
doing this is impossible. When Timothy first proposed the idea, there was a bit of
resistance from kernel folks who pointed out that inotify existed and
performed a quite similar function. But when Timothy's auditing project
started, inotify was not very mature and existed only as an external
patch,
so it made more sense at that time to develop this auditing code as a
separate feature entirely. Now that inotify is at least in the -mm tree, a
better argument can be made to use inotify instead. But Timothy and the
other developers of this patch, along with critics like <span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span>,
have hatched a plan to abstract the basic functionality common to both this
auditing code and inotify and make these projects simply access the
abstracted features directly to get what they need. When this actually
will be done is still an open question.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Adrian Bunk</b></span> has tagged a number of OSS sound drivers for removal. The
decision as to which drivers to remove and which to keep is not an easy one.
The goal is to preserve support for all existing hardware, and so before any
driver can be removed, Adrian must determine whether an ALSA equivalent
exists and works. This determination often can be made only by someone with
very old sound hardware, and such users may be difficult to find. Each case
must be confirmed individually, and Adrian does the legwork for each one,
following up on e-mail and asking questions of users. Housekeeping patches like
Adrian's are often thankless, if not downright unwanted by users afraid of
losing support for their favorite hardware. It's nice every once in awhile
to acknowledge the hard work of folks like Adrian, who put in many hours
each week, just on kernel cleanups like this one.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Wireless Security Lock</b></span> gadgets are finding support in Linux. These devices
allow a wireless system to detect when it has traveled too far from a given
location, in order then to perform some security function, like locking the
monitor. <span   class="bold"><b>Brian Schau</b></span>, for his first kernel driver, coded up support for
WSLs. In spite of the fact that a Bluetooth phone can provide similar
functionality, and in spite of the fact that a user-space application might
be better suited to the task than Brian's kernel driver, the project clearly
has merit, because it supports an actual existing piece of hardware. One way
or another, it seems, Linux will be supporting WSLs.
</p><p>
Andrew Morton has offered some clarification on whether users should prefer
a swap file over a swap partition, and why. In 2.6, he says, the difference
is virtually nil. Both in terms of performance and reliability, swap files
and swap partitions are equally good, with one exception: if the swap file
created is very fragmented, performance will suffer. But because swap file
fragmentation does not increase over time, simply creating a
nonfragmented swap file initially solves that problem completely. In 2.4, the
situation favors swap partitions over swap files, because the partition can
avoid certain memory allocations that swap files require.

As many of you already know, I have left <i  >Linux Journal</i>
to join SpikeSource. My first day at the new company,
I looked up some people in the employee directory,
which is a simple PHP interface on top of the LDAP
server&mdash;no need to change someone's account info on
the server and the person's employee directory entry
separately. It all stays together, and employees
can update their own info, such as cell-phone numbers.
</p><p>
DirectoryPages is not merely a handy way to keep
everyone's info in one place and put an easy Web
interface on it, it's also a good example of how to
use LDAP data in a PHP script. A full article on how
it works is bundled with it. Now all this thing needs
is TeX integration to autogenerate business cards.
</p><p>
(Yes, the following is a link to my new employer,
but I got <i  >Linux Journal</i> executive editor Jill
Franklin to approve it.)

When it comes to Linux adoption, educational institutes and government
agencies around the globe continue to lead the way. We hear a lot about
various countries mandating open-source and free software usage&mdash;China,
Germany and Brazil are only a few. To learn more about some other
international initiatives, check out these articles on LinuxJournal.com:

Marco Fioretti is writing a Web series for us that outlines how various
provinces in Italy are bringing Linux into their high schools. Part 1
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8309" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8309</a>) focuses on The
Istituto Tecnico Commerciale De Sterlich of Chieti Scalo in Central
Italy. Part 2 (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8507" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8507</a>)
looks at The Istituto Tecnico Commerciale (ITC, Commercial-Technical
Institute), &ldquo;F. Besta&rdquo;, in Ragusa. In Part 3 (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8508" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8508</a>), Marco takes us to
Abruzzo to learn about one elementary-school teacher's free software
project for schoolkids.

During a summer trip to the Middle East, Tom Adelstein learned about
many projects in the region that are using OSS. In &ldquo;Linux in Government:
Building Bridges and Managing Water&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8504" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8504</a>), he talks with Ammar
Ibrahim about Bulk Meter Flow and Operations (BMFO), a project started by
the Ministry of Water and Irrigation in Jordan.

One of the hottest home electronics products is the
Sonos Digital Music System: a Linux-based wireless
audio setup that works as a kind of iPod for the home.
</p><p>
Although other whole-home systems integrate with the TV
and contain hard drives, the Sonos works strictly
as a wireless distribution system. Your music and
other audio files live on Linux, Mac or Windows PCs
(or combinations of them&mdash;file sharing is through
Samba) and are displayed in color on Sonos' wireless
handheld controller. Each room has its own ZonePlayer&mdash;a small 50-Watt amplifier. You can choose the
speakers or buy Sonos' own bookshelf units.
</p><p>
Writing in MadPenguin.org, Christian Einfeldt says, &ldquo;It's the current
state of the art for wirelessly controlling music in a large home or
business where you need just the right music in the right room at the
right time. And best of all, it's powered by GNU/Linux!&rdquo; The
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Wall Street
Journal</em></span> calls it &ldquo;...easily the best music-streaming product I have
seen and tested. It's the Lexus of the category.&rdquo;
