Now that work is just a verb, not a place, are all
your security assumptions wrong?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x137a580.0x1472298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
It's time to question some security assumptions.
Regular users' systems are always on an internal
network with a firewall between them and the Internet.
The only hosts reachable from the outside are a few
bastion hosts. Bastion hosts run a strictly limited
set of software, and only sysadmins have accounts
on them. Computer security depends on physical security, because
anyone who breaks into the server room can boot the
server from a rescue disk and have his or her way
with the files.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, in the real world, you have a copy of the
project you're working on and a bunch of confidential
e-mail on your laptop, and you're drinking La Minita
at Dana Street Roasting Company while you peruse your
project's Request Tracker and hold a Jabber meeting
with people in three countries.
</p><p>
Public wireless caf&eacute;s are a lot of great
things, but secure corporate networks they're not.
Because more and more companies would rather pay for
laptops and drop-in office space than cubicles and
desktops for all, you can wave bye-bye to the neat
security chart with a bunch of stuff between the user
and the menacing Internet Cloud.
</p><p>
Linux distributions are starting to offer good support
for some encrypted partitions, which do the attacker
no good without the key. Mike Petullo takes the
process to its logical extreme and encrypts the root
filesystem, which means you can encrypt everything (page 62).
</p><p>
The less we trust the network, the more we need
encrypted e-mail.
At <i  >Linux Journal</i>, we rolled out GNU Privacy Guard
(GPG) for everyone. Encrypted mail isn't the tweaky
mess it used to be, now that the common mailers are
integrating GPG support. Find out how to make secure
mail a part of your work life in Roy Hoobler's article
on page 52.
</p><p>
Now that everyone is outside all the time, the problem
of removing unneeded software and keeping packages
up to date is even more critical. Fortunately,
many of the Linux distributions offer easy tools for
installing new versions. Jeremy Turner shows off
some screenshots on page 46. Meanwhile, we're still
experimenting with SELinux, which could lock down even
insecure versions of software to contain attacks.
James Morris gives us a peek at the SELinux future
on page 56.
</p><p>
The new mobile way of working isn't only a burden
for sysadmins. Users often prefer to escape from
cubicle-land. Why not make your company's Linux
migration a productivity and multimedia treat, not
a retraining chore? Just as Lincoln Durey's &ldquo;Dear
Laptop Vendor&rdquo; was going to press in the fall of 2004,
HP made the bold move of offering Linux preinstalled
on a full-featured notebook computer. We had one at
<i  >Linux Journal</i> to try out, and yes, we're impressed.
Get the details, including the results of a support
call, on page 74.
</p><p>
Have fun keeping your systems secure for the real
world, and if you see me editing the next issue at
a coffeehouse, come over and say hi.
