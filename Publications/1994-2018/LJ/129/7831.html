<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #129, January 2005</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

<span   class="bold"><b>Markus Lidel</b></span> has been named the official
<span   class="bold"><b>Intelligent Input/Output</b></span> (I2O) maintainer. Designed by the
I2O Special Interest Group, I2O is a hardware
specification that allows hardware to offload I/O
processing from the CPU, raising the performance
of I/O on that hardware, while at the same time
reducing its impact on the running system. Markus
is a relative newcomer to Linux kernel development,
first appearing in the kernel changelogs in March
2004 with some minor I2O patches for the 2.6.1
kernel. <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span>, as with so many other projects,
was the de facto maintainer at the time and accepted
many patches from Markus over the following few months.
By July 2004 and the 2.6.8 release, however, Markus in turn
was accepting I2O patches from other developers. In
August 2004, <span   class="bold"><b>Warren Togami</b></span> nominated Markus to be the
official maintainer, and after an acknowledgement
from <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span>, Markus updated the Maintainers
file in September 2004 to list himself as the official
I2O maintainer. Shortly thereafter he initiated a
rewrite/reorganization of the I2O code, which was
accepted into the 2.6.9-rc2 kernel, in accordance
with Andrew's new looser policies on large changes
within a stable kernel series.
</p><p>
Kernel development is often fraught with controversy
and dispute. Recently the <span   class="bold"><b>pwc</b></span> driver, supporting
Philips Web cameras, erupted in a dispute
between the driver maintainer, <span   class="bold"><b>Nemosoft
Unv</b></span>, and <i  >Linux Journal</i> columnist and kernel lieutenant <span   class="bold"><b>Greg
Kroah-Hartman</b></span>.
To support
various hardware, a hook to allow binary modules
to link into the kernel had existed for a long time
in the driver, against kernel policy. Eventually,
Greg insisted on its removal, and
Nemosoft asked Linus to remove the whole driver from
the kernel. Now, under the GPL, the driver author
has no legal right to insist on this, but <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> felt
it was important to honor the author's wishes,
especially if the code in question was about to be
unmaintained. This turned out to be an unpopular
decision with people like Alan Cox, who saw the
licensing issue as much more cut-and-dried. Nemosoft
had released the code and couldn't just take it
back. To illustrate his point, Alan said he might as
well ask Linus to remove all of Alan's contributions
over the years, which would in fact remove quite a
significant percentage of the kernel and completely
devastate the entire project. Alan's point simply
was that it made no sense to honor developers' requests
in such cases. After much arguing, <span   class="bold"><b>Luc
Saillard</b></span>
reverse engineered the binary module in question and
posted a new version of the pwc driver, without the
disputed hook.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>David Engebretsen</b></span> decided to stop being
the <span   class="bold"><b>PowerPC</b></span> maintainer and has been succeeded
by <span   class="bold"><b>Paul Mackerras</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Anton Blanchard</b></span>,
both of whom have contributed many PPC patches over
the years, along with <span   class="bold"><b>Benjamin
Herrenschmidt</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>Tom Rini</b></span> and many others. David maintained
the PPC port as part of his job at IBM and led
the team that did the original Linux port to the
PPC64 architecture.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jeff Garzik</b></span> has created <span   class="bold"><b>blktool</b></span>,
an easier, more generic version of the existing
hdparm utility. Like hdparm, blktool can wreak
havoc on disks if used improperly. Also like hdparm,
blktool still is fairly IDE-centric, though Jeff is
working on SCSI, I2O and RAID support. hdparm's
IDE-centrism may stem from the fact that it was
developed by <span   class="bold"><b>Mark Lord</b></span>, the original IDE subsystem
maintainer back in the early days. Like hdparm,
blktool provides a command-line interface to the
nitty-gritty details of your disk, allowing the
user to make fine adjustments in behavior, that
could result in noticeable speedups. The precise
interface used by blktool's command line is still in
flux; in particular, Alan Cox feels that as
long as a new tool is being developed, it should fix
some of the problems hdparm displayed, particularly
in the command-line interface. Jeff seems amenable
to various alternatives, and it looks as though
the final tool will have a variety of alternative
mechanisms for users to get their points across.
The real point seems to be that Jeff's initial
attempt has found support among kernel developers,
and various folks are hacking it into shape.

Isn't moving windows manually a drag? If you're
running a simple window manager, such as Metacity,
but you want the window matching and customizing
features of a more complex window manager such
as Sawfish, here's an add-on X utility for you.
Write an XML config file to match windows you
want to customize, and let Devil's Pie position
or tweak them for you. For example, you can pin a
certain application to appear on all desktops or
move all terminal windows with a certain title to
their own desktop.

Embedded systems are what software wants to be when it grows up.
Challenges such as using less memory, booting quickly and staying
up for a long time without updates are requirements. Whether you're doing
an in-car Linux system or developing phone switches for work, our
Web site can help.

If you're curious about what is involved in developing for embedded
platforms and targets, check out Dr Richard Sevenich's new Web series, a
hands-on introduction to embedded development. Part 1
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7848" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7848</a>) explains
how to pick a target for your embedded design. Future articles will
discuss hardware setup, getting familiar with uClinux, adding a GUI and
both porting and creating new applications. Follow his progress on-line

We've been following Carbot, an in-car computer company, in its quest to
reduce OS boot times, a major barrier in the widespread adoption of
car-ready computers and applications. The ultimate goal was to get a
five-second BIOS boot time. In the final installment of this series
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7857" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7857</a>), author Damien
Stolarz reveals whether the team achieved its goal&mdash;&ldquo;throw away all the
useless BIOS functionality, show video at the bootloader (that is, GRUB
splash screens) and start playing audio as early as we possibly could in
the boot sequence&rdquo;.

Our resident telecom and carrier-grade Linux specialist, Ibrahim Haddad,
spends much of his time at Ericsson Canada working on ways to improve
Linux for carrier-grade systems. His article &ldquo;Critical Server Needs and
the Linux Kernel&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7855" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7855</a>)
outlines four features the kernel needs for deployment on server
nodes in mission-critical environments: &ldquo;a cluster communication
protocol, support for multiple-FIB, a module to verify digital
signatures of binaries at run time and an efficient low-level
asynchronous event mechanism&rdquo;.

So when you find somebody smarter than you are, just
coast along. Your management responsibilities largely
become ones of saying &ldquo;Sounds like a good idea&mdash;go
wild&rdquo;, or &ldquo;That sounds good, but what about xxx?&rdquo;
The second version in particular is a great way either to
learn something new about &ldquo;xxx&rdquo; or seem
<span   class="emphasis"><em>extra</em></span>
managerial by pointing out something the smarter
person hadn't thought about. In either case, you win.

When you think about it, it makes sense. Linux and open-source products
are cheaper, more robust and more secure. Having Microsoft tell us that
their products have lower TCO is like them telling us that the Earth is
flat. Right-thinking CIOs know that Linux and open-source software
result in lower costs and are not likely to be hoodwinked by verbal
sleight-of-hand or spurious, vendor-manipulated TCO studies.
