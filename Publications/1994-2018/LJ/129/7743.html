When you can't depend on physical security to keep your files safe,
it's time to take the extra step of encrypting the filesystem.
Although this article covers converting a PowerPC-based system, the
principles are applicable to other architectures too.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe6a580.0xf622f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the <i  >Linux Journal</i> article &ldquo;Implementing Encrypted
Home Directories&rdquo; (August 2003), I described how to
encrypt home directories transparently. This article describes
how to implement another technique, an encrypted
root filesystem. I discuss the GNU/Linux boot
process and software requirements, present
some instructions, introduce Open
Firmware and discuss other relevant
considerations. The system I use to teach these
concepts is a New World PowerPC-based Apple iBook running
a pre-release of Fedora Core 3. Despite these
specifics, the concepts and procedures in this
article can be applied to any device, architecture
or operating system. My instructions assume
you have a spare USB Flash disk and your system's
firmware has the ability to boot off of it.
</p><p>
I also assume the reader is comfortable applying source patches
and compiling programs. As of Fedora Core 3 Test 3, the
mkinitrd and initscripts packages require patching to support an encrypted
root filesystem. A basic understanding of how to manage partitions and
create filesystems also is required. Performing a basic install
of a Linux distribution is beyond the scope of this article.
</p><p>
Before presenting the technical steps involved, a higher-level concept
must be discussed, trust. Trust is intertwined with
cryptography and authentication. An implicit assumption of
trustworthiness is given to any device that has an electronic key.
For example, when I share my bank account PIN with an automatic teller
machine, I trust that the ATM will not share my PIN with an inappropriate
third party. In the same way, when I provide an encryption key to my
computer, I assume the key will not be shared with anyone else. I trust
the computer to keep the secret between us.
</p><p>
So, can you trust your computer? Unless you carry it with you everywhere, you really can't. This is true even if the disks have been encrypted.
Consider this scenario: someone steals your computer as you sleep.
The thief makes a copy of the encrypted contents of the computer, even
though they are useless to him without their encryption key. He then
replaces the encrypted laptop contents with something a little more
diabolical and puts the computer back. When you wake up the next day, the
computer prompts for an encryption password as it does every morning.
But this time when you provide the key it electronically transmits the
key to the thief. Because he now has a copy of your data and key, he can
read your files.
</p><p>
This scenario may be a bit far-fetched, but it does illustrate a point.
You can't trust your laptop. It's too big to keep your eyes on all the
time. Therefore, no matter how well implemented your encryption system is,
it is built without the prerequisite foundation of trust.
</p><p>
To ensure that we can trust the computer's boot process, we need to separate it
from the computer. Consider this: you carry the keys to your car
with you instead of carrying your car. Your encryption key is a natural
conceptual leap from your car key. You can protect your
encryption key more easily, so you don't have to carry your computer everywhere.
To take things a little further and to address the above scenario, we
also will place the software required to boot the computer on this key.
The Flash disk will serve as this key. By protecting the software that
boots the system initially, in addition to the encryption key, we can
mitigate the risk of the boot process being hijacked.
</p><p>
An understanding of how your computer boots is required, because unlocking
an encrypted root filesystem is integral to the bootstrap process. The
current, stable kernel series, 2.6, optionally uses initramfs to help
boot, as documented in LWN.net's &ldquo;Initramfs Arrives&rdquo;. Initramfs is a cpio
archive that the kernel now knows how to unpack into a RAM-based disk.
This unpacked filesystem contains a script that traditionally loads kernel
modules needed to mount the root filesystem. In our case, this script
also unlocks the encrypted root filesystem. More information on
this subject can be found in the files buffer-format.txt and initrd.txt
that are distributed with the Linux kernel sources.
</p><p>
Several filesystem encryption interfaces are available for
Linux. Jari Ruusu's Loop-AES is one such project. Several
cryptoloop variations that provide an encrypted loopback device
also exist. This article focuses on the dm-crypt interface
provided by recent 2.6 Linux kernels. This interface currently
is preferred by the Fedora Project, and dm-crypt modules
are provided by Fedora's kernel packages. Also required is a statically
linked cryptsetup.
This utility simplifies the management of dm-crypt devices. Finally,
parted and hfsutils are used to manage the boot filesystem.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, Fedora Core's anaconda installer
does not yet support installing to an encrypted
filesystem out of the box. To
bypass this limitation, you must leave a partition free,
install Fedora, format the free partition as an
encrypted filesystem and copy the originally installed
data onto the new encrypted filesystem. For the
purpose of simplicity, I assume Fedora is to
be installed onto two partitions: /dev/hda4, mounted
at /home, and /dev/hda5, mounted at /. Because /home is
not populated until after Fedora is installed, we can
use /dev/hda4 as our spare partition and /dev/hda3 as
the swap partition.
</p><p>
Install Fedora Core 3, mounting /dev/hda4 at /home and /dev/hda5 at /.
Do not add any nonroot users yet, as /home will be wiped clean later.
At this point, you should have a fully functioning Linux system.
</p><p>
Before an encrypted filesystem is set up, you should randomize
the partition it will occupy. This eliminates a potential leak of
information about the disk's contents. Figure 1 demonstrates an
abstract disk that is half-full and not randomized properly.
Figure 2 demonstrates a disk that was randomized properly before
being formatted to contain an encrypted filesystem. Notice that, given
Figure 1, one can gain some knowledge about its contents (such as that
they span one-half of the disk). Figure 2 affords an adversary no
such luxury. In this case, the disk could as easily be empty as full.
A partition is randomized by overwriting its contents with random data:
<tt  >dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/hda4</tt>. This process can
take a long time, because creating random data is somewhat difficult.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7743f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. When you don't randomize the disk partition before
creating the filesystem, an attacker can see how full
it is.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7743f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Randomizing the partition hides how much is used.
</p></div></div><p>
To create an encrypted ext3 filesystem on /dev/hda4, use the
following steps:
</p><p>
1) Ensure that the aes, dm-mod and dm-crypt modules have been loaded into
the kernel.
</p><p>
2) Unmount the partition that will host the encrypted root filesystem,
/dev/hda4, from /home:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# umount /dev/hda4
</pre>
</p><p>
3) Create a random 256-bit encryption key and store it at /etc/root-key:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# dd if=/dev/urandom of=/etc/root-key bs=1c count=32
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe6a580.0xf62e48"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This key will be copied to the Flash disk later.
</p><p>
4) Create a dm-crypt device, encrypted using the key you just generated:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cryptsetup -d /etc/root-key create root /dev/hda4
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe6a580.0xf63000"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Accessing /dev/mapper/root now provides an encrypted layer on top of
/dev/hda4. By default, cryptsetup creates an AES-encrypted dm-crypt device
and assumes a keyspace of 256 bits.
</p><p>
5) Create an ext3 filesystem on /dev/mapper/root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# mkfs.ext3 /dev/mapper/root
</pre>
</p><p>
6) Mount the new filesystem:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# mkdir /mnt/encroot
# mount /dev/mapper/root /mnt/encroot
</pre>
</p><p>
7) Now that you have an encrypted filesystem, you must populate it with
the contents of /dev/hda5 (the original root filesystem):

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cp -ax / /mnt/encroot
</pre>
</p><p>
8) Finally, create an entry in /mnt/encroot/etc/crypttab so that various
utilities know how the filesystem was configured:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root   /dev/hda4       /etc/root-key   cipher=aes
</pre>
</p><p>
Now that we have our encrypted filesystem ready, it is necessary to
understand a little more about the target architecture's boot process.
Generally, computers have firmware that hands off execution to the
software that will complete the system boot. Protecting firmware is
beyond the scope of this article, so we assume that the system's
firmware can be trusted. Most readers probably are familiar with the
BIOS, the boot firmware used by the PC platform. I focus on Open
Firmware, a boot system used by computer manufacturers such as Apple,
Sun and IBM.
</p><p>
The installation instructions for NetBSD/macppc provide a good
introduction to Open Firmware. We are interested in using Open Firmware's
command-line interface to configure the computer to boot from a removable
Flash disk. Open Firmware allows you to view the devices connected
to a computer and view and set the value of firmware variables.
</p><p>
The Open Firmware prompt can be accessed by holding
down option-command-o-f on a New World (G3 and
later) Apple computer during the initial boot process.
</p><p>
The variable boot-device is used to determine what device the system
should use to boot. The printenv command allows one to inspect its
current value:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; printenv
[...]
boot-device	hd:,\\:txbi	hd:,\\:txbi
</pre>
</p><p>
This essentially means &ldquo;boot by executing the file of HFS type txbi on the
first IDE disk.&rdquo; The second : character (before txbi) causes the
token to be interpreted as an HFS file type. Otherwise, txbi would be
interpreted as the path to a file. In my case, the token hd is actually an
alias to the more complicated
<tt  >/pci@f4000000/ata-6@d/disk@0</tt>. This string
represents the path through various subsystems to the first IDE disk.
You can see what device an alias resolves to using Open Firmware's
devalias command.
</p><p>
To set the boot-device correctly we need to discover by what name Open
Firmware knows our Flash disk. Examining the device tree printed
by the ls command reveals the path to the Flash disk:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; dev / ls
[...]
	/pci@f2000000
		[...]
		/usb@1b,1
			[...]
			/disk@1
[...]
</pre>
</p><p>
Now that we know a little bit about the firmware's view of the computer, we
must spend some time investigating the software the firmware
initially executes: the bootloader. Generally, Linux systems that
run on Apple's PowerPC architecture employ a program called yaboot to
boot the system. yaboot is similar to LILO or GRUB and contains two key
programs, ofboot.b and yaboot. ofboot.b provides the first stage of the
bootstrap process. Essentially, it is ofboot.b's job to determine what
operating system to boot. For example, if a system has both Mac OS X and
Linux installed, ofboot.b executes Mac OS X or Linux's bootloader.
If the user chooses to load Linux, ofboot.b executes yaboot, the
second stage of the bootstrap process. yaboot then loads the Linux
kernel and, in our case, an initrd.
Figure 3 provides a illustration of how Linux boots using an encrypted root
filesystem on the PowerPC architecture.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7743f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The Booting Process on a PowerPC-Based System with Open Firmware
</p></div></div><p>
Our removable boot device requires the ofboot.b and yaboot programs,
a Linux kernel and an initrd that contains the encryption key. Apple's
current PowerPC-based architecture expects its boot media formatted
using HFS.
</p><p>
1) Use the parted program to create the proper bootable partition on the
Flash disk (mine is 64MB and is accessed using the device node /dev/sda):

<pre     class="programlisting">
# parted /dev/sda
(parted) mklabel mac
(parted) print
Disk geometry for /dev/sda: 0.000-62.500 megabytes
Disk label type: mac
Minor    Start       End     Filesystem  Name                  Flags
1          0.000      0.031              Apple
(parted) mkpart primary hfs 0.031 62.500
(parted) print
Disk geometry for /dev/sda: 0.000-62.500 megabytes
Disk label type: mac
Minor    Start       End     Filesystem  Name                  Flags
1          0.000      0.031              Apple
2          0.031     62.500              untitled
(parted) set 2 boot on
(parted) name 2 Apple_Boot
(parted) quit
</pre>
</p><p>
2) Create an HFS on the boot partition:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# hformat /dev/sda2
</pre>
</p><p>
3) Configure yaboot to boot off the appropriate device by modifying
/mnt/encroot/etc/yaboot.conf. The following is a minimum configuration:

<pre     class="programlisting">
boot=/dev/sda2
ofboot=/pci@f2000000/usb@1b,1/disk@1:2
partition=2
install=/usr/lib/yaboot/yaboot
magicboot=/usr/lib/yaboot/ofboot
default=linux
image=/vmlinux
        label=linux
        root=/dev/hda4
        initrd=/initrd.gz
        read-only
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe6a580.0xf63bb0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The value <tt  >/pci@f2000000/usb@1b,1/disk@1:2</tt> comes from
our earlier inspection of the Open Firmware device tree, and
<tt  >/pci@f2000000/usb@1b,1/disk@1</tt> is the first disk on the USB bus on the
PCI bus at f2000000. The device we are interested in is a disk, and
<tt  >:2</tt>
means partition 2.
</p><p>
4) Install the bootstrap programs and kernel to /dev/sda2:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# ybin --config /mnt/encroot/etc/yaboot.conf -v
# mount /dev/sda2 /media/usbstick
# cp /boot/vmlinux /media/usbstick
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe6a580.0x135c0c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
At this point, the crypto-aware initrd must be installed onto the Flash
disk. Fedora provides a tool named mkinitrd that can create
an initrd. However, at the time this article was written,
mkinitrd did not know how to mount an encrypted root. The patch at
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=124789" target="_self">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=124789</a> provides
this functionality. Once the patch is applied, mkinitrd reads
/etc/crypttab and creates an appropriate initrd:


<pre     class="programlisting">

1.  mkinitrd --authtype=paranoid -f /media/usbdisk/initrd.gz &lt;kernel version&gt;
2.  umount /media/usbstick

</pre>
</p><p>
The file /mnt/encroot/etc/fstab should be updated to reflect the
changes made:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/mapper/root /      ext3    defaults         1 1
</pre>
</p><p>
Encrypted swap or the absence of swap space
entirely is a prerequisite for an encrypted
filesystem. Reasons for this can be found in
&ldquo;Implementing Encrypted Home Directories&rdquo;
and in a BugTraq mailing-list thread titled
&ldquo;Mac OS X stores login/Keychain/FileVault
passwords on disk&rdquo;. When the patch at
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=127378" target="_self">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=127378</a>
is applied to the initscripts package, Fedora
allows users to encrypt their swap
partitions using a randomly generated session key.
Because swap
space isn't generally required to be consistent across reboots, the session
key is not saved when the system is powered down.
To enable encrypted swap, complete the following steps:
</p><p>
1) Add the following line to /mnt/encroot/etc/fstab, replacing any
previous swap record:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/mapper/swap swap   swap    defaults         0 0
</pre>
</p><p>
2) Add the following line to /mnt/encroot/etc/crypttab to tell the
system how to perform the encryption:

<pre     class="programlisting">
swap    /dev/hda3       /dev/urandom    swap
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe6a580.0x135c5e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
At this point we should be able to reboot the system and use our encrypted
filesystem. Again, we need to hold down option-command-o-f to enter the
Open Firmware prompt.
</p><p>
As demonstrated above, the path to the Flash drive's second
partition is /pci@f2000000/usb@1b,1/disk@1:2. Knowing this,
we can build the path
<tt  >/pci@f2000000/usb@1b,1/disk@1:2,\ofboot.b</tt>.
The , deliminates between the partition number and the filesystem path;
\ofboot.b is the filesystem path, and \ is like UNIX's / with the
filesystem root at the device's root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; dir /pci@f2000000/usb@1b,1/disk@1:2,\
Untitled            GMT                   File/Dir
   Size/      date       time  TYPE       Name
   bytes   9/ 3/ 4   21:44:41  ???? ????  initrd.gz
 2212815   8/28/ 4   12:24:21  tbxi UNIX  ofboot.b
    3060   9/ 3/ 4    2:21:20  ???? ????  vmlinux
  141868   9/28/ 4   12:24:22  boot UNIX  yaboot
     914   9/28/ 4   12:24:22  conf UNIX  yaboot.conf
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe6a580.0x135c7f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This confirms that Open Firmware can read the files required to
boot the system. Setting the value of the boot-device variable to
<tt  >/pci@f2000000/usb@1b,1/disk@1:2,\ofboot.b</tt> causes the system to boot
from the Flash disk: <tt  >setenv boot-device
/pci@f2000000/usb@1b,1/disk@1:2,\ofboot.b</tt>.
</p><p>
Once the system successfully boots from the encrypted
root, it is necessary to destroy all of the data on
/dev/hda5. This can be done with the same procedure
used to randomize the root filesystem's
partition: <tt  >dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/hda5</tt>.
You may want to perform this overwrite several times.
For one standard on sanitizing disks, see Chapter 8 of
the US Department of Defense's &ldquo;National Industrial
Security Program Operating Manual&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Following a safe sanitization, /dev/hda5 may be used as /home. The /home
filesystem also should be encrypted. Luckily, this is a much simpler
process,
because the system need not boot off of /home. Creating the filesystem
itself is similar to the steps taken to create the root filesystem.
</p><p>
1) Ensure that the aes, dm-mod and dm-crypt modules have been loaded into
the kernel.
</p><p>
2) Unmount the partition that will host the encrypted home filesystem,
/dev/hda5, from /home:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# umount /dev/hda5
</pre>
</p><p>
3) Create a random 256-bit encryption key, and store it at /etc/home-key.
One way to do this is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# dd if=/dev/urandom of=/etc/home-key bs=1c count=32
</pre>
</p><p>
4) Create a dm-crypt device, encrypted using the key you just generated:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cryptsetup -d /etc/home-key create home /dev/hda5
</pre>
</p><p>
5) Create an ext3 filesystem on /dev/mapper/home:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# mkfs.ext3 /dev/mapper/home
</pre>
</p><p>
6) Mount the new filesystem:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# mount /dev/mapper/home /home
</pre>
</p><p>
7) Create an entry in /etc/crypttab, so that various utilities
know how the filesystem was configured:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root    /dev/hda5       /etc/home-key   cipher=aes
</pre>
</p><p>
8) Finally, update /etc/fstab to contain an entry for /home:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/mapper/home /home  ext3    defaults         1 2
</pre>
</p><p>
At this point, it is appropriate to begin adding nonroot local user
accounts to the system. Setting up the encrypted root filesystem is
now complete.
</p><p>
Having all of your data encrypted can be dangerous. If the encryption key is
lost, your data is lost. Because of this, it is important to make
backup copies of the Flash disk containing your key. It also is crucial
to perform plain-text backups of the encrypted data. If you maintain a
bootable rescue disk, it may make sense to rethink the system components that
should be on it. A copy of your root and home filesystem keys, parted,
hfsutils, the cryptography-related kernel modules and cryptsetup are
excellent candidates.
</p><p>
How effective is this technique in protecting your data? In his book,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Secrets and Lies</em></span>, Bruce Schneier presents a technique that is useful in
evaluating this. An attack tree can be used to model threats. Figure 4
presents the beginning of an attack tree for our encrypted filesystem.
It is important to note that this attack tree is not complete and probably
never will be.

Figure 4. How can an attacker read the encrypted filesystem?
</p></div></div><p>
By using the techniques in this article and a little creative thinking, it is
possible to make the data on your hard disk more resistant to certain types of
theft. It is important to keep in mind the types of attacks that circumvent
these defensive techniques. Though other techniques must be used to protect
against network-based and other attacks, those described here are a
powerful tool toward the goal of overall system security.
