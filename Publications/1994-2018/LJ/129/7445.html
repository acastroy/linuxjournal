Finding 500 bugs in 50 different kernel
versions is the fruit of this thorough Linux testing
and code coverage project.

The Linux Test Project (LTP) was developed to improve the Linux kernel
by bringing automated testing to kernel design. Prior to the LTP, no
formal testing environment was available to Linux developers. Although most
developers unit-tested the effects of their own enhancements and patches,
systematic integration testing did not exist. The LTP's primary goal is to
provide a test suite to the Open Source community that helps to validate
the reliability, robustness and stability of the Linux kernel. The suite
tests kernel function and regression, with and without stress. The LTP is
not a performance benchmark, but benchmarks often are used to drive the
kernel during testing.
</p><p>
The LTP began as 100 test programs developed by SGI. Now, through
the joint efforts of SGI, IBM, OSDL, Bull, Wipro
Technologies and individual Linux developers, the LTP contains over
2,500 test programs, also called test cases, and a number of automation
tools. The LTP supports multiple architectures, including x86, IA32/64,
PPC32/64, and 32- and 64-bit s/390.
</p><p>
Although other test suites and projects exist, the LTP includes an
environment for defining new tests, integrating existing benchmarks
and analyzing test results. The Software Testing Automation Framework
(STAF/STAX) is an open-source system that allows you to plan, distribute,
execute and collect test results from a large pool of multiplatform test
hosts. STAF/STAX also provides a powerful GUI-monitoring application
that allows you to interact with and monitor the progress of your
jobs. Test-coverage visualization tools let you see how much of a
test's source code is executed by the kernel.
</p><p>
The IBM Linux Technology Center (LTC) has played a
key role in using the LTP to uncover defects in the
Linux kernel. Using the LTP, the
LTC has tested more than 50 new kernel versions
and found more than 500 defects. As covered in
Linda Scott's whitepaper (see the on-line Resources), a typical
kernel test cycle uses the LTP for focus
testing to isolate and validate Linux component
and application stability. This includes regression
testing on new kernels to ensure they meet
the functionality of previous kernels. Integration
testing then validates component interaction, driven
by macro-benchmark workloads. Finally, reliability
and stress testing validate systemic robustness
with extended duration tests (96 hours to 30 days).
</p><p>
The remainder of this article describes how to download and run the LTP test suite using the automation tools. We
also discuss some LTP tools that can be used to help improve kernel
development and testing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb0b580.0xc03558"></a>
The Test Suite</h2></div></div><p>
The tests cover a wide range of kernel functions, including system calls,
networking and filesystem functionality. The basic building block of
the test suite is a test program that performs a sequence of actions and
verifies the outcome. The test results usually are restricted to PASS
or FAIL. Together, all the test programs and tools make up the LTP package.
</p><p>
The LTP is a GPL package and is available from SourceForge.net. A stable
version of the LTP test suite source, ltp-<span   class="emphasis"><em>yyyymmdd</em></span>.tgz is released
monthly. As of this writing, the latest version is ltp-20040405. After
downloading the package, extract and install as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar zxf ltp-20040405.tgz
cd ltp-20040405
make
make install
</pre>
</p><p>
You need root access to perform that last step and also to run
the test suite. The test suite also is available in binary and source
RPM format. For those of you who like living on the edge, development
snapshots can be downloaded through anonymous CVS (see Resources).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb0b580.0xc037c0"></a>
Executing the Test Suite</h2></div></div><p>
Once installed, a number of options are available for running the LTP
test suite. The most popular method is to use the runalltests.sh
script, which executes about 800 of the original tests. The tests not
included in runall are destructive, require monitoring or for some other
reason cannot be automated. The runall script has a default behavior
to run a single iteration of the test suite and produce verbose screen
output. This output can be omitted with the quiet option (-q). As a
simple introduction, we ignore the screen information for now and use
the -l logfile_name and -p options to generate human-readable log results.
</p><p>
The test cases are executed by the test driver called Pan. Pan, included
in the LTP package, is a lightweight driver used to run and clean up
test programs. The runalltests script calls Pan to execute a set of
test cases or a single test case. You can execute a set of test cases
by providing runalltests with a -f scenario file. A scenario file is
a simple ASCII text file that contains two columns. The first column
has the name of a test case, and the second column has the command to
be run. Comments start with a pound sign. For example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# Testcase to test mmap function of the kernel
testcase1       mmap3 -l 100 -n 50

# Testcase to stress the kernel scheduler
testcase2       sched_stress.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
The test driver uses the exit value of the test case to decide success
or failure of a test. If the test case exits with a non-zero value, Pan
records this as FAIL. If the test case exits with a value zero, the driver
records it as PASS.
</p><p>
The simplest use of the test suite is to run it on your system to ensure
that
there are no failures:

<pre     class="programlisting">
runalltests.sh -l log -p -o output
</pre>
</p><p>
For known
failures, the LTP package includes an explanation and pointers to
places for more information. Below is the partial log file from running
ltp-20040506 on a 2.6.3 kernel:

<pre     class="programlisting">

</p><p>
In this partial log, 797 tests were run and six failed. rwtest03
and rwtest04 are I/O tests that failed due to mmap running out of
resources. This problem has been resolved. The remaining failures,
not shown in the log, are described below:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
setegid01: verify that setegid does not modify the
saved gid or real gid&mdash;failed because of a bug in glibc 2.3.2.
</p></li><li><p>
dio18,dio22: I/O testing&mdash;failed because of data comparison
mismatch.
</p></li><li><p>
nanosleep02: verify that nanosleep will suspend and return remaining
sleep time after receiving signal&mdash;failed due to lack of microsecond
clock precision.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Writing test programs is fairly straightforward. The test cases are
written in ANSI C and BASH and use the LTP Application Program Interfaces
(APIs) provided by the LTP library libltp
to report test status. Templates are provided that show you
how to develop test cases using
libltp. The test cases can use the interface to print
results messages, break out of testing sequence and report a test status
such as PASS or FAIL. Manual pages for using these APIs are
provided in the test suite package and also on the LTP Web site. For more
on the esoteric uses of LTP and a tutorial on developing tests that can
be included in the LTP, see the Iyer and Larson papers in Resources.

Automation Tools</h2></div></div><p>
Although not required to run the test suite, the LTP has a number of
related tools and projects that facilitate test automation. Two of
these projects are the Software Testing Automation Framework (STAF/STAX)
and the Open Source Development Lab (OSDL) Test Platform.
</p><p>
LTC uses STAF/STAX to manage a pool of test machines. Using the
STAF/STAX Web interface you can find and configure test machines,
then run and monitor any set of test programs and return the results.
STAF is an open-source, multiplatform, multilanguage
testing framework. It is based on the concept of reusable services,
such as process control, logging and event handling that automate
testing activities. At its core, STAF is a message
routing d&aelig;mon that maintains a network of local and remote services
and routes requests to those services. A network of STAF-enabled machines
is built by running STAF clients on dedicated networked hosts. STAX is
a GUI-based execution engine built on STAF, XML and Python. It provides
an interface for testers to distribute, execute and process test results.
</p><p>
The OSDL Scalable Test Platform provides a framework for developers to
execute tests against specific kernels and kernel patches through a Web-based interface. LTP is one of the tests that OSDL executes. Using the
Web interface, you also can search for historic test results. The LTP
Web site has detailed information regarding this framework.

Expanding the Test Suite with Coverage Analysis</h2></div></div><p>
The often unspoken assumption with software testing is that the test cases
cover a majority of the software source code written. A test covers a
line of code if running the test executes the line.
Coverage analysis
measures how much of the target code is run during a test and is a useful
mechanism for evaluating the effectiveness of the LTP test
suite. Given two
test cases that run successfully, the test with the higher code coverage
provides somewhat more assurance that the code is bug-free. Of course,
bugs still may exist in the untested code, and even 100% coverage does
not guarantee bug-free code.
</p><p>
Cornett's paper provides a good introduction to the many types of
coverage. We've based the LTP coverage on the
GCC compiler that provides statement and branch coverage. As stated
earlier, statement coverage reports which lines of the source code are
executed. Branch-conditional coverage reports which Boolean conditions in
a control statement, such as &ldquo;if&rdquo; or &ldquo;while&rdquo;, are tested and taken. In the
code below, branch-conditional coverage would tell us when the branch
was taken, statement1 executed, and when it was due to condition1 or
condition2 being true:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if ( condition1 || condition2 )
    statement1;
else
    statement2;
</pre>
</p><p>
GCC coverage works by passing the options -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage
to the compiler and the GCOV program that processes coverage
data. GCOV produces a source file annotated with the number of times
each line of code and branch condition was executed. GCC coverage was
intended originally for user-space programs and needed to be adapted
for the kernel because coverage data is produced only when a program
terminates, which the kernel never does.
</p><p>
Also, because the kernel is
not linked with standard C libraries, many of the GCOV structures are
not present in the kernel. The LTP has published a GCOV-kernel patch
to the Linux kernel that addresses these issues and allows developers
to use the existing GCOV tools to gather coverage data from a running
kernel. Installation instructions as well as a detailed description of
the functionality provided by the patch can be found at the LTP Web site and
in an Ottawa Linux Symposium paper by Paul Larson and others.
</p><p>
The GCOV-kernel patch is published on the LTP Web site as a separate
package, but it is included in the LTP development tree. In addition
to kernel code changes, when installed, the patch configures
the Makefiles to pass the coverage options to GCC when the kernel is
compiled. The coverage options instruct the compiler to generate code and
data structures to capture information that is used to determine which
lines of kernel code were executed. The user-space tool GCOV combines the
source files and the files generated by running a GCOV-enabled
program&mdash;in our case this is the kernel&mdash;to produce a new source code file
with the count for each line of C code, representing the number of times
the line was executed. Because the program output needed for GCOV is not
created until the program ends, and the kernel does not terminate, the
patch also creates a /proc/gcov/... tree that GCOV can use at any time
to get counter data from the kernel.
</p><p>
To facilitate coverage analysis further, the LTP has developed a
utility, LCOV, to create more useful graphic GCOV output. LCOV can
be downloaded from the GCOV-kernel Web site. LCOV
automates the process of extracting the coverage data from the kernel,
running GCOV and producing HTML. Once the GCOV-kernel patch is applied
and compiled, the coverage system can be used as follows.
</p><p>
First, load the gcov-proc kernel module:

<pre     class="programlisting">
insmod gcov-proc.o
</pre>
</p><p>
Clear the GCOV counters:

<pre     class="programlisting">
lcov --reset
</pre>
</p><p>
Run the LTP test suite or your favorite test program next, then
capture GCOV data:

<pre     class="programlisting">
lcov -c -o coverage.info
</pre>
</p><p>
Create the HTML coverage tree:

<pre     class="programlisting">
genhtml coverage.info
</pre>
</p><p>
genhtml is one of the LCOV tools and generates HTML output at both
the directory and file level, as illustrated in Figures 1 and
2. Figure 1 is a partial screenshot of the Linux
kernel source subdirectory. In this example, the total amount of code covered
for the directory is 47.3%. Each line shows a filename. A color-coded
meter is used to represent the amount of coverage for the file: green for
files with 50% coverage or greater, yellow for files with coverage between
10% and 50% and red for files with less than 10% coverage. The last
two columns show the percent coverage for the file and number of lines
executed over the total number of lines instrumented. Both figures are
displayed on a color-coded background. Figure 2 is a partial
view of a printk.c file. This is a graphical view of the original GCOV
output. A similar color coding is used to allow you to identify
under-utilized code quickly. At this time, LCOV output shows only statement
coverage and not branch coverage.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
As Linux plays an increasing role in the enterprise computing space,
robustness and reliability requirements have led to more formal testing
methods. The LTP is a functional regression testing suite used to help
improve Linux reliability. For any kernel development project, running the
LTP test suite gives you a method to help ensure your changes don't break
the kernel. As you test your kernel modifications, a GCOV-enabled kernel
and accompanying LTP tools will help you visualize the effectiveness of
your testing and help focus the test team on areas with low coverage.
</p><p>
In addition to test results that show kernel regressions and code coverage
gaps, the LTP and coverage analysis potentially provide a method for
measuring kernel improvement over time. Consider the simple argument:
combined with higher coverage of the kernel code, fewer kernel failures
suggest that Linux kernel reliability is improving. A study of how well
LTP tracks improvement in Linux is part of our future work.
</p><p>
Finally, we would like to encourage developers
to submit their tests to be included in the LTP
suite. As always, suggestions and comments are welcome,
and should be sent to the mailing lists found on the
LTP Web site.
