Software licenses are like pluggable authentication
modules&mdash;bad to try to re-implement yourself
but important to get right if you want to be secure.
Technology attorney Lawrence Rosen offers a manageable
introduction to the subject in this book. If you ever
have trouble getting the right to use free software
at work because of license concerns, buy a copy of
this book. If your company is planning to release
free software, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Open Source Licensing</em></span> gives you the background to
get the most out of your meetings with a lawyer about
the license.
</p><p>
This book is a useful field guide to the rights and
obligations that the common free software licenses
offer and their strengths and weaknesses. It also
covers the essentials of copyright and patent law
as they apply to software. Rosen also introduces his new
licenses, the Open Software License and Academic Free
License, which he says fix yet-unexploited
legal bugs in older licenses.
</p><p>
For someone who was motivated to write his own
set of software licenses, Rosen is generous to the
industry-standard GNU General Public License (GPL).
He gives the GPL a clean legal bill of health, which
makes this book helpful when deciding to use and
contribute to GPL-covered software. But he does offer
a clear explanation of why a software author would
want the additional teeth that his new licenses offer.
By binding users to a contract, he lets the licensor
set the venue for any lawsuit over the license, insist
on attorney's fees and obtain other advantages in court.
</p><p>
This book does an especially good job of covering
how the common open-source licenses handle software
patent threats and the differences in the patent
defense measures in each license. However, it
would have been helpful to include a discussion of
one approach that patent holders have taken when
contributing patented methods to GPL software&mdash;offering a patent license separate from the GPL but
ostensibly compatible with it. Linux contributions
from IBM, Red Hat and FSMLabs are licensed this way,
under three different patent grants.
</p><p>
Although the book is strong on the legal side, it's
weak on what many consider the overwhelming network
effects of the GPL and the advantages of keeping
new projects compatible with the existing universe of
GPL code. It's surprising that a 2004 book that
covers both the Mozilla Public License and the issue
of relicensing doesn't mention that Mozilla began
relicensing to include the GPL in 2001.
</p><p>
The business decisions about what software license
to adopt are yours, and this book's power to
dispel Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt about
licenses and bring FUD victims into the software
commons is invaluable. Reading <span   class="emphasis"><em>Open Source
Licensing</em></span> is an ideal first step in the license
decision process.
