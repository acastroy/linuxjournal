We covered HP's new Linux laptop at LinuxWorld in
August 2004, and they loaned us one for a full review
that fall. The nx5000 is a mid-size business notebook
PC with a base weight of 5.75 pounds and a base price
of $1,199. Display choices
are XGA (1024&times;768) or SXGA+ (1400&times;1050), for an
additional $75. Our review unit had the 1400&times;1050
screen and a combo DVD/CD-RW drive and weighed in
at 2.85kg, or 6.28lb. The processor was a 1.4GHz
Intel Pentium M. The nx5000 comes with 256MB to 2GB
of memory, and ours had 512MB. A subset of SuSE 9.1 Professional is
preinstalled and two CDs are included.
</p><p>
Physical layout is thoughtful, with a good-size
keyboard. As on many laptops, the Ctrl keys are
undersized and squeezed into the corner of the bottom
row with a bunch of other modifiers. For regular use,
you'll want to swap Caps Lock and Ctrl. The Escape
key is undersized but in a convenient place above the
tilde, and the backslash/pipe key is big and where
it belongs, above Enter.
</p><p>
Overall size is larger than lightness-crazed road-warrior
types will be comfortable with, but if you're
transporting it only for commuting or occasional trips, the
extra size and weight could be a good trade-off for you.
</p><p>
HP claims a full working day of battery life with
both batteries installed, but laptop battery life
is a notorious &ldquo;your mileage may vary&rdquo; measurement.
Under light use with wireless on, including some
text editing, Web surfing, listening to Internet
radio and uploading the photo for this article, the
nx5000 with one battery lasted more than 4.5 hours.
HP installs Thomas Renninger's powersave d&aelig;mon,
which is a nice touch.

Hardware Support</h2></div></div><p>
The Atheros a/b/g card was not configured out of
the box, but a quick point-and-click session to set
it to DHCP brought it up on an 802.11b network.
The installed Atheros driver is proprietary.
There's one other proprietary module installed,
the slamr module for Winmodem support.
</p><p>
Laptop audio is usually tinny and awful, but the
nx5000's speakers, branded with a JBL Pro logo, are
consumer audio quality and plenty good enough for
Internet radio, playing games or watching a DVD.
If you use the nx5000 as your home entertainment
system too, the weight starts to look not so bad.
Speaking of watching DVDs, the included DVD-playing
software is InterVideo's LinDVD, which is DVD
CCA-licensed. Playback was smooth, even with tasks
running in the background. For day-to-day use, it
might be more practical to swap out the DVD drive for
the extra battery, use an independently developed DVD
player that lets you play movies from the hard
drive and simply connect an external drive when needed.
</p><p>
The volume controls for the speakers and headphones
work separately, and the KDE volume control is
configured to control speaker volume only. We had to
go to the YaST volume settings control panel to turn
up the headphones. This is a little confusing to
start with, but the right thing for those times when
you want to listen in private and not annoy everyone
else in the library or caf&eacute; when you forget to plug
in the headphones and an instant message comes in.
A little user-interface help is needed here.

Devices</h2></div></div><p>
Everything onboard works, but how well is the system
configured to work with the external USB devices that
are your eyes and ears on the road?
</p><p>
We plugged in a brand-new Canon PowerShot S410 camera
and fired up the preinstalled Digikam to pull the
photos off with no configuration needed.
</p><p>
Plugging in a Sony DCR-HC20 MiniDV camcorder
meant a little command-line work.
The IEEE 1394 modules were installed, and following
the instructions in Marcel's column in the December 2004 issue, we
modprobed them in. Kino was not installed, but we
brought in a copy from a SuSE 9.1 Professional DVD
and captured some video.
</p><p>
It's understandable that a nonlinear video editing
tool is missing from a default laptop install, but
also strangely missing was OpenSSH, which people at
<i  >Linux Journal</i> use constantly. We pulled that in from
the SuSE DVD as well. If you invest in this laptop,
you also might want to pick up a copy of the full
distribution so that you can get your favorite tools just as
easily.

Support</h2></div></div><p>
Fortunately, for our ability to test HP's Linux
support, we found one thing that didn't work&mdash;the
front-panel volume and mute buttons. We got through to
a Linux support person quickly, but the nx5000 he had
seemed not to have the same load as the review unit,
and the solution that got the review unit working
didn't work for him. The solution was to run
LinEAK, which was installed but not running in our
KDE session.
</p><p>
Finally, right before we sent the laptop back, one
person was able to get the nx5000 to lock up twice
in one day simply by editing a file with Vim in a Konsole
window. Ctrl-Alt-Backspace wouldn't work to kill X,
and we weren't able to duplicate the problem.
</p><p>
With the nx5000, HP gets closer than anyone has yet to
a general-purpose business PC running Linux. If you
want to make your company's Linux desktop migration a
treat of working in caf&eacute; and enjoying media instead
of a chore, get one to evaluate. Dorm-room or small-apartment dwellers can consider this as a good main
computer and entertainment system.
