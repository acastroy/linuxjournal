A discussion of open-source compliance, the challenges faced when
establishing a compliance program, an overview of best practices
and recommendations on how to deal with compliance inquiries.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2336580.0x242e2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Traditionally, platforms and software stacks were built using proprietary
software and consisted of various software building blocks that came from
different companies with negotiated licensing terms. The business
environment was predictable, and potential risks were mitigated through
license and contract negotiations with the software vendors. In time,
companies started to incorporate open-source software in their platforms
for the different advantages it offers (technical merit, time to market,
access to source code, customization and so on). With the introduction of
open-source software to what once were purely proprietary software stacks, the
business environment diverged from familiar territory and corporate comfort
zones (Figure 1). Open-source software licenses are not
negotiated agreements. No contracts are signed with software
providers (that is, open-source developers). Companies now must deal with
dozens of different licenses and hundreds or even thousands of licensors
and contributors. As a result, the risks that used to be managed through
license negotiations now must be managed through compliance and
engineering practices.

Enter Open-Source Compliance</h2></div></div><p>
Open-source software initiatives provide companies with a vehicle to
accelerate innovation through collaboration with a global community of
open-source developers. However, accompanying the benefits of teaming with the
Open Source community are very important responsibilities. Companies must
ensure compliance with applicable open-source license obligations.
Open-source compliance means that open-source software users must observe all
copyright notices and satisfy all license obligations for the open-source
software they use. In addition, companies using open-source software
in commercial products, while complying with the terms of open-source
licenses, want to protect their intellectual property and that of third-party suppliers from unintended disclosure.
</p><p>
Open-source compliance involves establishing a clean baseline for the software
stack or platform code and then maintaining that clean baseline as features
and functionalities are added.
</p><p>
Failure to comply with open-source license obligations can result in the
following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Companies paying possibly large sums of money for breach of open-source
licenses.
</p></li><li><p>
Companies being forced by third parties to block product shipment and do
product recalls.
</p></li><li><p>
Companies being mandated by courts to establish a more rigorous open-source
compliance program and appoint an &ldquo;Open-Source Compliance
Officer&rdquo; to monitor and ensure compliance with open-source licenses.
</p></li><li><p>
Companies losing their product differentiation and intellectual property
rights protection when required to release source code (and perceived
trade secrets) to the Open Source community and effectively license
it to competitors royalty-free.
</p></li><li><p>
Companies suffering negative press and unwanted public scrutiny as well
as damaged relationships with customers, suppliers and the Open Source
community.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2336580.0x242ec48"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
FSF Compliance Lab</b></p><p>
The Compliance Lab at the Free Software Foundation (FSF) helps enforce the
license for all free
software. Information

</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2336580.0x242eeb0"></a>
Lessons Learned</h2></div></div><p>
There are three main lessons to learn from the open-source compliance
infringement cases that have been made public to date:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Ensure that your company has an open-source management infrastructure in
place. Open-source compliance is not just a legal exercise or merely checking a
box. All facets of a company typically are involved in ensuring proper
compliance and contributing to the end-to-end management of open-source
software.
</p></li><li><p>
Make open-source compliance a priority before a product ships. Companies
must establish and maintain consistent open-source compliance policies
and procedures and ensure that open-source license(s) and proprietary
license(s) amicably coexist well before shipment.
</p></li><li><p>
Create and maintain a good relationship with the Open Source community.
The community provides source code, technical
support, testing, documentation and so on. Respecting the licenses of the
open-source components you use is the minimum you can do in return.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2336580.0x242f220"></a>
Compliance Challenges</h2></div></div><p>
Companies face several challenges as they start creating the compliance
infrastructure needed to manage their open-source software consumption. The
most common challenges include:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Achieving the right balance between processes and meeting product
shipment deadlines. Processes are important; however, they have to be light
and efficient, so they're not regarded as an overhead to the
development process and to avoid making engineers spend too much time
on compliance activities.
</p></li><li><p>
Think long term and execute short term: the priority of all companies
is shipping products on time, while also building and
expanding their internal open-source compliance infrastructure. Therefore,
expect to build your compliance infrastructure as you go, doing it the
right way and keeping scalability in mind for future activities and
products.
</p></li><li><p>
Establish a clean software baseline. This is usually an intensive activity over a period of time. The
results of the initial compliance activities include a complete software
inventory that identifies all open-source software
in the baseline,
a resolution of all issues related to mixing proprietary and open-source code, and
a plan for fulfilling the license obligations for all the open-source
software.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2336580.0x242f590"></a>
Building a Compliance Infrastructure</h2></div></div><p>
Here are the essential building blocks of an open-source compliance
infrastructure required to enable open-source compliance
efforts (Figure 2):
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10466f2.large.jpg"><img src="10466f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Open-Source Compliance Building Blocks
</p></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Open-source review board (OSRB):
comprises representatives from
engineering, legal and open-source experts. The OSRB reviews requests for
use, modification and distribution of open-source software and determines
approval. In addition, the OSRB serves as a steering committee to define and
manage your company's open-source strategy.
</p></li><li><p>
Open-source compliance policy:
typically covers usage, auditing and post-compliance
activities, such as meeting license obligations and distribution of
open-source software. Usual items mandated in a compliance policy
are approval of OSRB for each piece of open-source software included in a
product, ensuring that license obligations are fulfilled prior to customer
receipt, mandatory source code audits, mandatory legal review and the
process and mechanics of distribution.
</p></li><li><p>
Open-source compliance process:
the work flow through which a request
to use an open-source component goes before receiving approval, including scanning code, identifying and resolving any flagged
issues, legal review and the final decision. See HP's &ldquo;FOSS
Management Issues&rdquo; article at <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/compliance" target="_self">www.fsf.org/licensing/compliance</a> for an example of a compliance
process. 
</p></li><li><p>
Compliance project management tool:
some
companies use bug-tracking tools that already were in place, and other
companies rely on professional project management tools. Whatever your
preference is, the tool should reflect the work flow of your
compliance process, allowing you to move compliance tickets from one phase
of the process to another, providing task and resource
management, time tracking, e-mail notifications, project statistics and
reporting.
</p></li><li><p>
Open-source inventory management:
it is critical to know what open-source software is included for each
product, including version numbers, licensing information, compliance
information and so on. Basically, you need to have a good inventory of all
your open-source
assets&mdash;a central repository for open-source software that has been
approved for deployment. This inventory is handy for use by
engineering, legal and OSRB.
</p></li><li><p>
Open-source training:
ensures
that employees have a good understanding of your company's open-source
policies and compliance practices, in addition to understanding some of the
most-common open-source licenses. Some companies go one step further by
mandating that engineers working with open-source software take 
open-source training and pass the evaluation.
</p></li><li><p>
Open-source portals:
companies usually maintain two open-source portals:
an internal portal that houses the open-source policies, guidelines,
documents, training and hosts a forum for discussions, announcements,
sharing experiences and more; and an external portal that is a window to the world and the Open Source
community and a place to post all the source code for open-source packages
they use, in fulfillment of their license obligations with respect to
distribution.
</p></li><li><p>
Third-party software due diligence:
you should examine software supplied to you by
third parties carefully. If third-party software includes open-source
software, ensure that license obligations are satisfied, because this is your
responsibility as the distributor of a product that includes open-source
software. You must know what goes into all of your product's
software, including software provided by outside suppliers.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2336580.0x2828128"></a>
Who's Involved in Open-Source Compliance?</h2></div></div><p>
Several departments are involved in ensuring open-source compliance (Figure
3). Here's a generic breakdown of the different
departments and their roles in achieving open-source compliance:
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10466f3.large.jpg"><img src="10466f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Teams Involved in Ensuring Open-Source Compliance
</p></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Legal: advises on licensing conflicts,
participates in OSRB reviews, and reviews and approves content of
the open-source external portal.
</p></li><li><p>
Engineering and product team:
submits OSRB requests to use open-source software,
participates in the OSRB reviews,
responds promptly to questions asked by the compliance team,
maintains a change log for all open-source software that will be made
publicly available,
prepares source code packages for distribution on the company's open-source
public portal,
integrates auditing and compliance as part of the software development
process checkpoints, and takes available open-source training.
</p></li><li><p>
OSRB team: drives and coordinates all open-source activities, including
driving the open-source compliance process;
performs due diligence on suppliers' use of open source;
performs code inspections to ensure inclusion of open-source copyright
notices, change logs and the like in source code comments;
performs design reviews with the engineering team;
compiles a list of obligations for all open-source software used in the
product and passes it to appropriate departments for fulfillment;
verifies fulfillment of obligations;
offers open-source training to engineers;
creates content for the internal and external open-source portals;
and handles compliance inquiries.
</p></li><li><p>
Documentation team:
produces open-source license file and notices that will be placed in the
product.
</p></li><li><p>
Supply chain:
mandates third-party software providers to disclose open-source software
used in what is being delivered.
</p></li><li><p>
IT:
supports and maintains compliance infrastructure, including servers, tools,
mailing lists and portals; and
develops tools that help with compliance activities, such as linkage analysis.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2336580.0x2828860"></a>
Establishing Compliance Best Practices</h2></div></div><p>
The following compliance best practices fall under six
major categories. Each of the categories represents a step in a typical
compliance process (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10466f4.large.jpg"><img src="10466f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. A Generic Open-Source Compliance Process
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>1. Scanning Code</b></span>
</p><p>
The first step in the compliance process is usually scanning the source
code, also sometimes called auditing the source code. Some
common practices in this area include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Scanning everything&mdash;proprietary code, third-party software and even
open-source software, because your team might have introduced modifications
triggering the need for additional due diligence and additional obligations
to fulfill. 
</p></li><li><p>
Scan early and often&mdash;scan as early in the development
process and as often as possible to identify new packages entering your
build. 
</p></li><li><p>
Scan newer versions of previously approved packages&mdash;in the
event that a previously approved packaged was modified, you should rescan it
to ensure that any code added to it does not have a conflicting license and
that there are no additional obligations to meet.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2336580.0x2828e90"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Source Code Scanning Tools</b></p><p>
There are commercial and open-source tools that offer the
capabilities of scanning source code for potential open-source issues.
Commercial tools include
Protex from Black Duck Software, Inc. (<a href="http://www.blackducksoftware.com/protex" target="_self">www.blackducksoftware.com/protex</a>) and
Palamida Compliance Edition from Palamida (<a href="http://www.palamida.com/products/complianceedition" target="_self">www.palamida.com/products/complianceedition</a>).
A popular open-source tool is 
FOSSology (<a href="http://www.fossology.org" target="_self">www.fossology.org</a>).
</p></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
2. Identification and Resolution of Flagged Issues</b></span>
</p><p>
After scanning the source code, the scanning tool generates a report that
includes a &ldquo;Build of Material&rdquo;, an inventory of all the files in the source
code package and their discovered licenses, in addition to flagging any
possible licensing issues found and pinpointing the offending code.
Here's what should happen next:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Inspect and resolve each file or snippet flagged by the scanning tool.
</p></li><li><p>
Identify whether your engineers made any code modifications. Ideally, you
shouldn't rely on engineers to remember if they made code changes. You
should rely on your build tools to be able to identify code changes, who
made them and when.
</p></li><li><p>
When in doubt of the scan results, discuss it with Engineering.
</p></li><li><p>
If a GPL (or other) violation is found, you should report to Engineering
and request a correction. Rescan the
code after resolving the violation to ensure compliance.
</p></li><li><p>
In preparation for legal review, attach to the
compliance ticket all licensing information (COPYING, README, LICENSE
files and so on) related to the open-source software in question.
</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>3. Architecture Review</b></span>
</p><p>
The architecture review is an analysis of the interaction between the
open-source code and your proprietary code. Typically, the architecture review is
performed by examining an architectural diagram that identifies the
following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Open-source components (used as is or modified).
</p></li><li><p>
Proprietary components.
</p></li><li><p>
Components' dependencies.
</p></li><li><p>
Communication protocols.
</p></li><li><p>
Linkages (dynamic and static).
</p></li><li><p>
Components that live in kernel space vs. userspace.
</p></li><li><p>
Shared header files.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The result of the architecture review is an analysis of the licensing
obligations that may extend from the open-source components to the
proprietary components.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
4. Linkage Analysis</b></span>
</p><p>
The purpose of the linkage analysis is to find potentially problematic code
combinations at the dynamic link level, such as dynamically linking a GPL
library to proprietary source code component (Figure 5). The common
practices in this area include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Performing dynamic linkage analysis for each package in the build.
</p></li><li><p>
If a linkage conflict is identified, report to it Engineering to
resolve.
</p></li><li><p>
Redo the linkage analysis on the updated source code to verify that the
code changes introduced by Engineering resolved the linkage issue.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
As for static linkages, usually companies have policies that govern the use
of static linkages, because it combines proprietary work with open-source
libraries into one binary. These linkage cases are discussed and resolved
on a case-by-case basis.
</p><p>
Figure 5 illustrates the difference between static and dynamic linking to
highlight the importance of identifying how open-source license obligations
can extend from the open-source components (libraries, in this example) to
your proprietary code through the linking method.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10466f5.large.jpg"><img src="10466f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Static vs. Dynamic Linking
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
5. Legal Review</b></span>
</p><p>
The best practices of the legal review include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Review the report generated by the scanning tool attached to the
compliance ticket.
</p></li><li><p>
Review the license information provided in the compliance ticket.
</p></li><li><p>
Review comments left in the compliance ticket by engineers and OSRB
members.
</p></li><li><p>
Flag any licensing conflict and reassign compliance ticket to
Engineering to rework code if needed.
</p></li><li><p>
Contact the open-source project when licensing information is not clear,
not available or the code is licensed under more than one license with
unclear terms/conditions.
</p></li><li><p>
Decide on incoming and outgoing license(s)
</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
6. Final Review</b></span>
</p><p>
The final review is usually an OSRB face-to-face meeting during which open-source software packages are approved or denied usage. A good practice is
to record the minutes of the meeting and the summary of the discussions
leading to the decisions of approval or denial. This information can become
very useful when you receive compliance inquiries. For approved open-source
packages, the OSRB would then compile the list of obligations and pass it
to appropriate departments for fulfillment.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2336580.0x273b2c8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Open-Source Compliance Insurance</b></p><p>
In the past few years, some insurance companies started offering insurance
services against the legal
risks that can result from using open-source software. The insurance policy
often is called open-source
compliance insurance. The insurance policy (depending on the issuing
company) offers coverage for
monetary damages, including profit losses related to noncompliance with
open-source software
licenses and the cost of updating the offending code.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2336580.0x273b4d8"></a>
Responding to Compliance Inquiries</h2></div></div><p>
This section presents guidelines to observe when dealing with compliance
inquires. These guidelines aim to maintain a positive and collaborative
attitude with the requester of compliance information while investigating
the allegation and ensuring proper handling in case of license violation.
Figure 6 illustrates the recommended steps to follow when dealing with
open-source compliance inquiries.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10466f6.large.jpg"><img src="10466f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Handling an Open-Source Compliance Inquiry
</p></div></div><p>
Several companies received negative publicity and/or got sued because they
either ignored requests to provide open-source compliance information, did
not know how to handle compliance inquires, lacked or had a poor compliance
program, or simply refused to cooperate, thinking it was not
enforceable. By
now, we know that none of these approaches is fruitful or beneficial to
any of the parties involved. Therefore, as a general rule, companies should
not ignore open-source compliance inquiries. Instead, they should
acknowledge the receipt of the inquiry, inform the inquirer that they will
look into it and provide a date when to expect a follow-up.
</p><p>
You should understand who the reporter is, the motivation and
whether the accusation is accurate or even current. Furthermore, not
every reporter understands licenses fully, and sometimes there may be
mistakes in the submissions. Make sure you
fully understand the inquiry and that you have all the necessary
information to isolate the problem and investigate it internally. If that's
not the case, ask the reporter to be specific and provide you with
the missing details to start your investigation.
</p><p>
Keep an open dialog with the reporter
and show that your company maintains rigid compliance practices.
Highlighting your open-source
compliance program and practices shows a good-faith effort toward
compliance. Send updates of your internal
investigation when they are available.
</p><p>
After concluding the internal investigation (within an acceptable time
limit) through the review of the compliance due diligence completed for
the specific software component (or product) in question, 
inform the reporter of the results.
</p><p>
If indeed there is a license violation as reported, it is your
responsibility to resolve the issue with the reporter, while being
collaborative and showing goodwill. You need to understand the obligations
under the applicable license and show how you will meet the obligations and
how soon.
