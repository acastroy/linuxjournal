Google's Evan Martin and Mads Ager discuss the challenges behind making a
browser work well on Linux, Mac OS and Windows.

This article on the development of the Google Chrome cross-platform
browser started off like any other interview. I interacted with
Google by e-mail and phone and started pulling together the responses to
my questions. It turned out that the &ldquo;official&rdquo; responses were much
shorter than I was used to. &ldquo;Why are these guys so shy?&rdquo;, I thought.
In interviews, I typically have to whittle down my respondents' answers
because they <span   class="emphasis"><em>love</em></span> telling their story&mdash;in glorious detail!

So, I went back to Google to see what was up. &ldquo;Free your developers to
speak!&rdquo;, I exclaimed. &ldquo;We want to know the gritty insiders' take on Google
Chrome development!&rdquo; My contact there told me that interviews are
challenging because a direct quote is like going &ldquo;on record&rdquo; and needs
to be vetted by several layers of management (and maybe attorneys?).
And, when you're the big fish in the pond, you have to be careful what
you say. I am not used to such caution, and I certainly don't like it,
but I indeed understand it.
</p><p>
After this and subsequent discussions, I realized we had a pretty complete
picture of what Google Chrome is all about. The only hitch is that
one part of the material came from direct interviews and another part
came from more informal discussions and e-mail messages. Thus, we agreed that
while I could talk freely about Google Chrome, only authorized material
could be quoted. What follows, then, is a summary of my discussions with
Google, followed by an interview with Google Chrome developers Evan Martin
and Mads Ager. Martin is a Senior Google Software Engineer and Linux
enthusiast working on all platforms of Google Chrome. Before working
on Chrome, Martin worked on Google's search-result ranking. Mads Ager is
Tech Lead for the V8 JavaScript engine project and and its integration in
the Google Chrome browser; he is based in the Aarhus, Denmark, office.

As we go to press, Google just announced its Chrome operating system. Chrome
OS will be based mainly on Web applications and will add an interesting
dimension to the &ldquo;Google World&rdquo;, as it will be possible to run
a completely Google-based desktop environment. Although the Chrome OS will
be a separate OS, it will run Linux under the hood. We're not surprised.

information on the Chrome OS and what it means for Linux users.

Google's Strategy with Chrome</h2></div></div><p>
In some of my earliest conversations with Google, we talked about the
company's motivations for building Chrome. After developing a range
of rich and complex Web apps, the company saw that it was time to
build a browser from scratch that could better handle &ldquo;today's
Web&rdquo;.
From the beginning, they focused on a browser that innovated in four key
areas, namely speed, simplicity, security and stability. Early on, the
Google Chrome team realized that the linchpin for innovating in these
key aspects, as well as to handling the new Web apps, would be a much
more efficient handling of JavaScript. Thus, the V8 JavaScript engine,
explained further below, was conceived and became central to the Google
Chrome Project.
</p><p>
Google hopes that innovations like V8 will change the feel of the
desktop, making the Web apps we're using more and more feel like
native ones. Besides the internal code needed to achieve efficient
JavaScript processing, Google Chrome hopes to maximize this native feel by
keeping the UI minimal, including an "app mode" that lets one create
a desktop icon that links to a URL with merely a tiny UI around the edges.
</p><p>
From a development standpoint, Google noted the difficulty in making
this user experience acceptable on platforms with very different
capabilities and conventions. Rather than just doing a brute-force port,
the Google Chrome team has focused on often taking a step back from
the code and looking at the larger picture of what a certain part of
the code accomplishes for the user and then translated that into more
abstract benefits for the respective Linux, Mac OS or Windows user.
On some platforms, native capability exists in whole or in part for
core functionality, such as sandboxed processes, but not on others.
This fact has required a wide range of refactoring or writing new code
depending on existing functionality found on the respective platform.
</p><p>
One example of making Google Chrome good on the Mac platform
is what the company did with WebKit. The team first had to come to
terms with what it meant to use WebKit for Chrome and determine what
it could provide. Interestingly, Google says that in the examples of
Chrome or Safari, only about half the code is WebKit. In addition,
WebKit was never really designed to be run in a separate process from
the rest of the browser UI. In order to accomplish this, Google had to
write much of its own drawing and event handling &ldquo;plumbing&rdquo; rather
than simply dropping a WebView into a window in Interface Builder.
However, the developers have been able to draw on much of the work that
was done for the Windows version to solve this problem.
</p><p>
Of course, Google Chrome's entire development process is much more
efficient and potent given its open-source nature. More important than
trying to &ldquo;win the browser war&rdquo; in the traditional
sense&mdash;that is, get people
to use Google Chrome as their primary browser&mdash;the company feels 
its open-source efforts with Chrome already have stimulated and seeded a
great deal of innovation and made other browsers better than they would
have been in Google Chrome's absence. In fact, Google takes at least
some credit for speed improvements and security enhancements that have
taken place in other browsers during the past year, which is advantageous
for everyone.
</p><p>
Given that Google Chrome is open source, we were curious to know how
involved outside developers have been to its development. Although my
contacts were unable to give me specific numbers, I was told that
outside participation is very high, especially in terms of bug reports from
users of the early developer builds of the browser. Google also works
very closely with the WebKit team, so changes made by WebKit developers
at Apple or others in the WebKit community are integrated into Google
Chrome as well.
</p><p>
And now, on to the interview with Evan Martin and Mads Ager.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2887580.0x2980010"></a>
The Developers Speak</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> In a nutshell, what inspired Google to create Chrome and
how did it come about?
</p><p>
EM: We built Google Chrome because we believed we could add
real value for users and help drive innovation on the Web. Google Chrome
is built for speed, has a very simple interface and uses innovative
technology to ensure it is always secure and stable, providing a great
experience for users as they browse the Web. But what's more, by making
Google Chrome open source and developing a powerful new JavaScript engine,
V8, we believe we can help spur innovation in the industry and provide
developers with the platform with which to build the next generation
of Web applications. This is good for users, and good for Google, as we
benefit directly when the Web gets better.
</p><p>
LJ: What is the Google Chromium Project?
</p><p>
EM: After we wrote the code for Google Chrome, we open sourced it
under the name Chromium. Much like Firefox is a trademark of Mozilla,
Google Chrome is a trademark of Google; the name Chromium is not,
so distributions are free to use it to refer to the same project. We
hope that developers and browser vendors take a look at the Chromium
source code and that it will be useful for new projects built by the
Open Source community in the future.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> This being our cross-platform development issue, we're curious to
explore the challenges and innovations in that area. What have been
the major issues in making Chrome great on all of its platforms?
</p><p>
EM: Much of the challenges we've encountered on Linux stem from how
heterogeneous the user base is&mdash;which, surely, is also the strength
of Linux. This ranges from how to port simple UI decisions (Chrome's
shade of blue was chosen to look good next to the blue seen on every
Windows computer), to getting boring technical details (a binary built
on Ubuntu won't work on a Fedora machine), to real problems that will
require engineering work to solve.
</p><p>
One good example of the latter is adapting our sandboxing model for
Linux. Getting a process sandboxed in a way that's useful to us is
challenging on Windows, with the relevant source code consisting
of more than 100 files, but it needed to be implemented only once to
work everywhere. On Linux, there are a variety of easier-to-use
but different sandboxing systems available, and different Linux
distributions ship with different (or no) sandboxing APIs. Here's an
article about a kernel patch we've proposed for discussion toward that
end: <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/332974" target="_self">lwn.net/Articles/332974</a>.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> What innovations does Chrome bring to browsing? 
</p><p>
EM: We did a lot of interesting things in building Google
Chrome. First, it's simple and easy to use&mdash;we've designed Google
Chrome to be as unobtrusive as possible, taking up the minimum amount of
space on your screen, and allowing you to search and browse all from the
address bar. Its multiprocessed architecture also ensures Google Chrome
is fast and stable. Additionally, we designed Google Chrome for speed
from the beginning, including building a new JavaScript engine called V8
from scratch to handle rich, complex Web applications.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> Can you tell us more about V8, its history, your rationale
for developing it and who the key people were behind it?
</p><p>
MA: The V8 Project started in late 2006. At that time, existing
JavaScript engines did not perform very well. The goal of the V8 Project
was to push the performance of JavaScript engines by building a new
JavaScript engine on which large object-oriented programs run
fast. The
V8 Project was pioneered by the dynamic duo of serial virtual machine
builders Lars Bak and Kasper Lund in a farmhouse outside Aarhus, Denmark.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> What innovations and new approaches does V8 bring to the browser?
</p><p>
MA: V8 uses the concept of hidden classes and hidden class transitions
combined with native code generation and a technique called inline
caching to make property accesses and function calls fast. V8 uses
precise generational garbage collection to make the engine scale to
large object-oriented programs that use a lot of objects. In addition,
V8 contains a JavaScript regular expression engine that was developed
from scratch, is automata-based and generates native code for regular
expressions.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> What language(s) is Chrome/V8 written in?
</p><p>
MA: V8 is mostly written in C++, but some of the basic JavaScript
libraries are implemented in JavaScript itself.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> What platforms does V8 support?
</p><p>
MA: V8 runs on Windows, Linux and Mac.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> What CPU architectures does it support for native code compilation
of JavaScript?
</p><p>
MA: V8 supports IA32 and ARM.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> Are there plans to extend it to other CPU architectures?
</p><p>
MA: We are working on a 64-bit version. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> Is the code generation better on some architectures than others?
</p><p>
MA: There are different trade-offs for the different architectures, and
we try to make the code generators as good as we can for the different
architectures. The code generator for IA32 does register allocation
and does more inlining than the code generator on ARM. In general,
the IA32 code generator has been tuned more than the ARM one.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> Did you name it after the internal combustion engine or the vegetable
drink?
</p><p>
MA: The internal combustion engine. It was developed in the context
of Google Chrome, and we thought that there should be a powerful V8 engine
under the &ldquo;chrome&rdquo;.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> Why did Google choose to develop a new JavaScript engine and use
WebKit rather than use code from Mozilla?
</p><p>
EM: We have always been and remain great supporters of Firefox&mdash;Mozilla helped lead the way in much of the innovation we've seen
in the browser space during the last couple years, with features like
tabs, search boxes in the browser chrome and extensions. They've also
proved that you can build a mass-market software product using open-source technology and collaborative development in the open. However,
we initially thought of our work in this space as an experiment and
didn't want to impose our ideas on anyone else. Rather, we thought about
developing a new JavaScript engine and open-sourcing it so that other
browser developers could benefit.
</p><p>
We think that numerous open-source projects are good for the entire
space because they allow developers to make advances and share them
quickly. We continue to have a great relationship with Mozilla, and many
of our engineers actively work on features in Firefox through Mozilla's
public participation process.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> What can you tell us about the status, road map and challenges
regarding the Linux version? We're salivating here.
</p><p>
EM: The Developer version is available for a few Linux distributions
already. Although this is an early release and not ready for your average
user, we hope you get an idea of what Google Chrome for Linux will be
like and keep following our development in the open as we make progress
on a beta and stable version.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> How many developers in how many locations are dedicated to Chrome
development, and how many solely to the Linux version?
</p><p>
EM: Although we don't go into details about the number of Google
employees on any particular product, we have a core team of engineers who
are working hard to get the Linux build of Google Chrome up and running.
As a team, to prevent fragmentation, we try to have all developers
work on all platforms&mdash;I refactor code on Windows to make it work on
Linux, and if someone on the Mac team breaks the Linux build, it's his or
her
responsibility to fix it. Pieces like the networking stack can be worked
on from any platform, so developers can just pick their preference.
</p><p>
At one point, I counted Google developers contributing from more than
a dozen different locations (some work from their homes); we have even
more once you count the contributions we receive from other developers.
One of my favorite experiences of this project has been filing a bug
one evening, then waking up the next day to see a patch to fix it from
someone in Europe.
</p><p>
We've also received many patches from outside of Google, and have even
promoted some of our best contributors to committers themselves.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> Was there a specific Google application that prompted Google to
decide it needed a bigger/faster browser?
</p><p>
EM: I think of Google Chrome as being less about making Google
applications faster and more about making the Web as a whole faster.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> What toolkits are used to build
Chrome? And, are there any interesting
issues regarding tools worth mentioning?
</p><p>
EM: Google Chrome on Linux relies on a ton of free
software&mdash;about:credits lists more than 15 subprojects we include
source from&mdash;as well as standard system libraries like FreeType, NSS (the Mozilla
SSL/TLS implementation) and GTK+. There has been a lot of discussion
on-line over toolkit choice; it was surprisingly uncontroversial within
the team to choose the one that Firefox and Flash depend on and that we
had more experience with. I think other options would have been just
as good, and I would, in particular, love to see someone knowledgeable
about Qt contribute patches.
</p><p>
Regarding tools, I'd like to especially call out gold, the fast linker
that is little known but has been a lifesaver for us.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> How has the development of Google Chrome for Linux been going?
Can you share some ups and downs you've experienced so far?
</p><p>
EM: I run only Linux at home. For me personally, the biggest up was
after working on Windows for so long, to be able to install and
use it finally myself.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> Is there a tentative date for when a beta release will be ready
for Linux?
</p><p>
EM: Not yet, but we're working hard on it. You can track our progress
on Linux development by running the in-progress version available at
<a href="http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel" target="_self">dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel</a> or via the mailing
lists and source found on the Chromium developer site at <a href="http://chromium.org" target="_self">chromium.org</a>.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> Will the Linux and Mac OS versions one day catch up with and enjoy
equal functionality with the Windows release?
</p><p>
EM: Yes, it is one of our highest priorities right now.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> Thanks to you both for your fascinating insights on Google Chrome!
