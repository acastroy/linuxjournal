In my never-ending search to do all communications through the same
IRC client, this month I present tircd&mdash;a great way to connect to Twitter
over IRC.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2733580.0x282b3b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In last month's column, I talked about the fact that I thought IRC was the
ideal interface for quick communication with my friends. I keep an IRC
session running at all times within a screen session, so I can continuously
lurk in all of my channels. Because many of my friends use IM instead of
IRC though, I've had to figure out ways to manage all of my communication
without having a ton of different programs open. Last month, I discussed how
I used Bitlbee so I could access all sorts of IM services from my IRC
client, and I promised that in the follow-up column, I would talk about how
to do something similar for Twitter.

A Quick Twitter Rant</h2></div></div><p>
In case you didn't read last month's Point/Counterpoint column, let me
summarize my opinion here. I don't see the point of Twitter. I think
everything people use Twitter for already could be achieved with IRC and
instant messaging without the character limits. Again, IRC is my ideal way
to communicate, but now some of my friends (ahem Bill) talk more on Twitter
than they do on IRC. So after much prodding from Bill, I bit the bullet and
registered a Twitter account so I could see what the fuss was about.
</p><p>
Now, just because I had a Twitter account didn't mean I was going to flood
the Internet with every meal and traffic jam in my life. My main
requirement for setting up the account at all was that I could access
everything via IRC. That way, Twitter was nothing more than another IRC
channel, only with higher latency and lower stability. To be honest, I
mostly use it in &ldquo;read-only&rdquo; mode and just read other people's tweets.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2733580.0x282b720"></a>
tircd to the Rescue</h2></div></div><p>
It turns out I'm not the only one who wanted to access Twitter over
IRC, and in fact, quite a few different programs out there provide a
local IRC gateway to Twitter. Unfortunately, none of the programs have been
packaged for my distribution yet, so after struggling to get a few running, I
finally found one with a reasonably simple install that worked: tircd.
</p><p>
tircd is a simple Perl script that works much
like Bitlbee. When you start
the program, it creates a new IRC server on your local machine that you can
connect to with an IRC client. The only difference is that it interfaces
with your Twitter account, so people you follow show up as users in the
channel, and their tweets show up as normal chat messages. Once you are in
the channel, everything you type becomes a new Twitter message as well, so it
behaves much like any other IRC channel.
</p><p>
To install tircd, first go to the main project page at
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/tircd" target="_self">code.google.com/p/tircd</a>, and download the latest
version. As with
many Perl scripts, tircd makes use of some CPAN modules you might not have
on your system, so dust off your Perl programmer hat, and type the following
command as root to install the CPAN modules:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cpan -i POE POE::Filter::IRCD Net::Twitter
</pre>
</p><p>
If this is the first time you've used CPAN on your system, you first
will have to go through a basic CPAN configuration process, so it knows which
mirrors to use and whether you have any proxies in place. Apart from when
you choose the mirrors, the default settings should be fine, and when you
select the mirrors, simply pick a few that might be close by.
</p><p>
Once the CPAN modules are installed, extract the tircd package in some
directory (your home directory works), and then change to that directory.
You'll see that only a few files are inside:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar xzvf tircd_v0.7.tar.gz
$ cd tircd
$ ls
ARTISTIC  GPL  tircd.cfg  tircd.pl  tircd.pod
</pre>
</p><p>
tircd includes a sample configuration file that is heavily commented, so you
can see what each option does. The default settings should work in most
situations, unless you already run a local IRC server (such as Bitlbee in my
case). If you do run another IRC server, change the port setting in the
file from port 6667 to port 6668 so it won't conflict.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2733580.0x282bb40"></a>
Start and Connect to tircd</h2></div></div><p>
To start tircd, simply execute the tircd.pl script and pass the path to the
tircd.cfg file as an argument. Because I was already in the tircd
directory, I
could type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./tircd.pl ./tircd.cfg
</pre>
</p><p>
You should see a number of log messages scroll by in the terminal, and if
you want to use the terminal for something else, don't forget to add the
&amp;
character at the end to start this in the background. Now you might be
wondering how you enter your account information. All of this is set when
you connect to the local server. Just use your Twitter user name and
password as authentication. For instance, on most command-line IRC clients,
you would type:


<pre     class="programlisting">
/server localhost 6667 twitter_password twitter_username
</pre>
</p><p>
In my case, as I already had Bitlbee running on port 6667, I connected to
port 6668:


<pre     class="programlisting">
/server localhost 6668 twitter_password twitter_username
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you are connected to the tircd server, join the #twitter channel. tircd
automatically imports everyone you are following, so they show up as
users in the channel, and you also will see their recent posts. Any users
that follow you back are voiced (+v).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2733580.0x282bf08"></a>
Using IRC Commands with tircd</h2></div></div><p>
tircd works with a subset of traditional IRC commands, so it is pretty
intuitive if you already are familiar with IRC. Your last Twitter status
shows up as the topic of the #twitter channel, and if you want to update
your status, all you have to do is type a message in the channel. If you
want to send a direct message to other users, simply send them a private
message. Likewise, if they send you a direct message, it shows up as
a private message in IRC.
</p><p>
There are two different ways to follow or remove users. First, you can
follow or remove them from the Twitter site or from any other Twitter
client, and you will see those users join or leave your #twitter channel.
Second, you can use the <tt  >/invite</tt> IRC command followed by the users' Twitter
user names to follow them. To remove them, all you have to do is
<tt  >/kick</tt> them
from the channel. If you want to block users completely, just use
<tt  >/ban</tt>, and
use <tt  >/unban</tt> to unblock them. If you want to get
information about a user, you
can use the standard IRC <tt  >/whois</tt> command.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2733580.0x282c278"></a>
Advanced Twitter Channels</h2></div></div><p>
One of the more interesting aspects of tircd is that you can set
up multiple channels with only certain users in it. This can be useful if
you follow a large number of accounts and want to organize them. Simply
<tt  >/join</tt>
a new channel on the tircd server, and use <tt  >/invite</tt> to add those particular
users to that channel. Now, whenever those users update their status, it 
appears both in #twitter and in this new channel.
</p><p>
You also can use new channels for custom search queries. Again,
<tt  >/join</tt> a new
channel of any name, and then use the <tt  >/topic</tt> command to change the topic to
the Twitter search query you want to use. All of the results of your search
then appear in the channel.
</p><p>
Okay, I admit it, Twitter isn't so bad when you can access it inside IRC. I
still think it's easier and faster to chat with people over IRC, but with
tircd, I can find out what Larry King and Oprah had for lunch in my
localhost #twitter channel and chat with all the great people in the
official #linuxjournal channel all from the same client.
