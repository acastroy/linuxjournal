The Titanium open-source platform lets Web developers leverage
their Web skills for creating desktop applications.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2363580.0x245b2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Titanium is an open-source platform that enables developers to build rich
desktop applications using standard Web technologies. Titanium applications
run natively on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows operating systems. At a
high level, Titanium competes directly with Adobe AIR, although it differs
from AIR in three major ways. First, Titanium is open source; it's
licensed under the Apache Public License (version 2). Second, Titanium is
fully extensible; Titanium extensions can be written using a number of
popular languages, including C++, JavaScript, Ruby and Python. Finally,
Titanium opens up user interface programming to popular languages like Ruby
and Python&mdash;a job typically reserved only for JavaScript. Both Ruby and
Python have full access to the Document Object Model (DOM), which puts
these languages on par with JavaScript for building rich, dynamic user
interfaces.
</p><p>
It is important to note that Titanium is not a system that provides
a point-and-click ability to build a single application that runs
both on the Web and on the desktop;
however, that is not to say code sharing across the Web
interface and desktop interface is impossible.
</p><p>
Some developers may choose to develop with a share-and-segregate
pattern: write a common set of shared libraries, then write
platform-specific code for use in a Web interface and other
code for use in a desktop interface.
In this case, you'll still have a single
codebase, but you'll end up with two different apps.
</p><p>
Other developers may choose to develop using progressive enhancement.
With progressive enhancement, you start by implementing a basic set of features, then as
new resources become available, you build up functionality to make use
of these new resources.
</p><p>
A good example is Google Docs. There's a basic set of features
you can access on-line, but if you install Google Gears, you get
off-line access and other features as well.
The same goes for Titanium apps. Developers can enhance
their Web applications progressively by adding features and functions that will
be available only when the app is run on a Titanium instance.
Using this approach you have just a single app.
</p><p>
Both of these techniques are valid
choices when it comes to developing apps. Both techniques have pros and
cons, and it's up to you as the developer to choose which method to use.
</p><p>
No matter which technique you choose&mdash;two separate codebases,
one codebase and two apps, or one app&mdash;at the very least, Titanium
allows you to leverage your Web development knowledge to build desktop applications.
It lets you use HTML and JavaScript, as well as other languages
most often associated with Web development, to develop
desktop applications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2363580.0x245b6c8"></a>
No More Limits on Web Development</h2></div></div><p>
Titanium is a development platform with one clear goal: leverage Web
technologies to create rich, cross-platform desktop applications. Using
Titanium, you can create desktop applications using HTML and JavaScript,
yet still get features not available on browser applications. For example,
Titanium Web applications built for the desktop can access the filesystem
and interact with the underlying operating system.
</p><p>
The idea behind Titanium isn't new, but Titanium clearly separates itself
by giving you something unique: unlimited possibilities with open-source
choices. You aren't forced to use anything proprietary&mdash;you can use any library or
framework you want. All technological decisions are yours to make.
</p><p>
Although I mainly program with JavaScript for Web applications, it isn't
the only technology that powers the Web. Titanium works well with Python,
PHP, Ruby, Java, Flash and Flex, and Silverlight. So whatever technology
you're using right now to develop your Web applications, you'll likely be
able to use it with Titanium.
</p><p>
Because Titanium is distributed under the open-source Apache Public License
v2, you can download the source code, play with it, fork it and extend it.
It's this extensibility that makes Titanium a platform that developers can
grow with in the future. The platform can morph and evolve into different
forms as new needs emerge.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2363580.0x245b930"></a>
Rapidly Evolving Web Development Platform</h2></div></div><p>
Titanium is evolving rapidly and has experienced several major changes to
its architecture in the past few months.
</p><p>
The initial preview release of Titanium (PR1) incorporated WebKit and a
modified version of Google Gears. Essentially, Titanium PR1 used WebKit as
its main component, and additional features were exposed to the runtime via
a native extensions system, which gave developers access to features from a
modified version of Gears.
</p><p>
Soon after this initial preview release, the Titanium team started to
re-architect the platform. Google Gears was removed, and instead, a new
system for exposing new features was created: Kroll.
</p><p>
Kroll is the microkernel that powers Titanium and extends the framework.
This compact microkernel, written in C++, is a cross-language,
cross-platform &ldquo;binding&rdquo; and invocation framework that enables mixing and
matching code within the kernel. All the features that Titanium exposes are
accomplished via Kroll modules. By using Kroll, Titanium gains the ability
to support a multitude of languages and technologies. And, because Kroll is
fully extensible, anyone can add more features to the platform, using any
technology. You don't need to be a C++ guru to extend
Titanium. You can create new modules using Python and Ruby, or even just
plain-old JavaScript.
</p><p>
Titanium's use of WebKit was retained during the rewrite from PR1, and for
good reasons. Not only is WebKit one of the best, standards-compliant
engines available today, but it also features lots of goodies, such as HTML5
client database storage, CSS transformations and animations, and a fast
JavaScript engine. All of these, of course, are available on Titanium.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2363580.0x245bbf0"></a>
Getting Started with Titanium Applications</h2></div></div><p>
Enough theory&mdash;it's time to get our gloves out and start working with
Titanium. First, download the latest version of Titanium from
<a href="http://titaniumapp.com/download" target="_self">titaniumapp.com/download</a>, and execute the package:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod +x Titanium-PR3-SDK.bin
$ ./Titanium-PR3-SDK.bin
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll be greeted by a window containing the License Agreement; click I
Accept to continue. Wait for the installer to finish, and the next thing
that pops up on your screen is the second tool that you'll use the most
while developing applications for Titanium (aside from your favorite
text editor): the Titanium Developer.
</p><p>
Titanium Developer is the main tool you need for developing Titanium
applications. It features several tabs for different purposes, ranging from
packaging your app, managing projects and discovering cool stuff from other
developers (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10437f1.large.jpg"><img src="10437f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Titanium Developer
</p></div></div><p>
The first tab is Projects, which helps you manage your Titanium
projects. Here you can create new projects, run them for testing and
package them for distribution (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10437f2.large.jpg"><img src="10437f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Projects
</p></div></div><p>
The Sandbox is a very useful tool for testing code without having
to create a new project.
To see it in action, try typing the following
snippet of code into the text area on the Sandbox tab, then press Launch
(Figure 3):

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;div id="output"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
document.getElementById('output').innerHTML
                        = "Hello World from Titanium";
&lt;/script&gt;

</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10437f3.large.jpg"><img src="10437f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Sandbox
</p></div></div><p>
Congratulations! You just launched your first Titanium application via the
Sandbox. Titanium Developer takes the snippet of code and launches a
Titanium app using that code. On the side of the text area for the
snippets, there are buttons for popular JavaScript frameworks. You can
click one of those to add them to your sandbox application for testing
instead of having to include them yourself.
</p><p>
The next tab, Apps, is a tool for discovering other awesome Titanium
applications. Titanium enables you to distribute your applications easily
via a distribution and packaging cloud. Every app that's packaged as public
will be featured in the Apps tab, making it easier for you to share and
distribute applications to your users (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10437f4.large.jpg"><img src="10437f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Apps
</p></div></div><p>
Up to this point, Titanium Developer probably seems like any other development tool. You
use it to create new projects, test them and package them for
distribution&mdash;normal development stuff. But it goes beyond that.
Titanium
Developer isn't merely a development tool, it's a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>social development</em></span> tool.
Social development harnesses the power of social media for engaging,
learning and collaborating with a global community of developers. That's 
why Titanium Developer contains two other tabs: Community and Feeds.
</p><p>
The Community tab contains a full IRC client that connects to the official
Titanium IRC Channel, enabling you to talk to other developers, get help
with tricky code or even share tips and tricks. The Feeds tab features
live Web feeds from Twitter and FriendFeed regarding Titanium, so you'll be
up to date about everything that's going on with the platform. The same
tool that you use to create, package and deploy projects is also a tool
that connects you to the worldwide community of developers working with the
same platform as you (Figure 5).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10437f5.large.jpg"><img src="10437f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Community Feeds
</p></div></div><p>
And, the best thing about Titanium Developer? It's actually built using
Titanium.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2363580.0x245ca60"></a>
Titanium Project 101</h2></div></div><p>
It's easy to create new projects using Titanium Developer. The Projects tab
takes you step by step into creating a new project. The first step asks you
which JavaScript libraries you'd like to add to your project. You can add
libraries by clicking on their logos, and you also can opt out by not
clicking any. For this example, try adding MooTools.
</p><p>
Next, you need to input information about your project. Type anything
you want for the Project Name, Project Description, Publisher Name and
Publisher URL fields. For the Project Location, click on the small folder
icon on the side of the text field, and select the directory on your system
where the project will be placed. Finally, you need an icon for the
project, so click on the small folder icon on the side of the field for
Application Image, and browse for an image file. Click Create Project.
</p><p>
The Project tab now displays your project on the list and some project
information on a window on the right. This window has three tabs: the first
one displays your project's information, the second one displays links to your
application packages, and the third one displays distribution and download
statistics for your application (Figure 6).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10437f6.large.jpg"><img src="10437f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Create Project
</p></div></div><p>
Select the project in the list, and click on the small box icon. This
brings you to the Packager where you can run, package or install your
application. Click on the Package and Launch button to launch your newly
created project.
</p><p>
You now have your first project, but it doesn't really do much at
this point. So, open your file manager and navigate to the directory you
selected for the Project Location when you created your project.
</p><p>
Inside your project directory, you'll see several files and directories
(Figure 7): 
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
dist: the directory where Titanium Developer stores your packaged app
so you can launch it for testing.
</p></li><li><p>
manifest: a file used by Titanium to determine settings for packaging
your apps, like your app's information as well as settings and versions of
the modules you're using on your application.
</p></li><li><p>
tiapp.xml: the descriptor file for the application. This is used by
Titanium to determine settings before running your application, such as
settings for the initial window, version information and copyright
information.
</p></li><li><p>
Resources directory: where all your application files are
stored&mdash;your HTML pages, stylesheets and scripts all should be kept here.
</p></li></ol></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10437f7.large.jpg"><img src="10437f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Project Directory
</p></div></div><p>
Titanium is very lenient when it comes to the structure of the Resources
directory. You can create subdirectories to structure your project in any
way you want, depending on your style.
</p><p>
Now, open the index.html file inside the Resources directory with your
favorite editor. It should look like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;style&gt;body{background-color:#292929;color:white}&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="mootools-1.2.1.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
Welcome to Titanium
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, it's just a simple HTML page, and Titanium Developer
already included a link to the MooTools script (which also is included
inside the Resources directory). Now, edit the file so it looks like
Listing 1.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2363580.0x2855808"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 1. JavaScript, Python and Ruby, All in One HTML File</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
function helloJS() {
    window.document.getElementById('output').innerHTML
                       = "Hello from Titanium using Javascript";
}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type="text/python"&gt;
def helloPython():
    window.document.getElementById('output').innerHTML \
                         = "Hello from Titanium using Python"

window.helloPython = helloPython
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type="text/ruby"&gt;
def helloRuby
    window.document.getElementById('output').innerHTML \
                         = "Hello from Titanium using Ruby"
end

window.helloRuby = helloRuby
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div id="output"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;button onclick="helloJS()"&gt;helloJS&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button onclick="helloPython()"&gt;helloPython&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button onclick="helloRuby()"&gt;helloRuby&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre></div><p>
Save the file, then go to the Titanium Developer's Project tab, and click 
the package icon on your project. Click Package and Launch, and test your
application. Click the buttons to get a hello world from three different
languages&mdash;all in a single page (Figure 8).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10437f8.large.jpg"><img src="10437f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Hello World App
</p></div></div><p>
While you're writing code, you're sure to run into bugs. Luckily,
Titanium includes WebKit's Web Inspector, which you can use for various
developments tasks. To open the Web Inspector, simply right-click on your
app, and select Inspect Element.
</p><p>
Once you're done writing code and perfecting your application, you're now
ready to package your application, which is easy
to do with Titanium Developer. In the Packager window, click the
Package for Distribution button.
</p><p>
You are given several options. The first one is to select for which
platforms to package your app&mdash;you can choose from OS X, Windows and
Linux (or all three). Next, you need to decide whether to bundle the
runtime with your application or install it via the network during launch.
Then, you decide which modules you'll add to your project and
whether to bundle them with your app (Figure 9).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10437f9.large.jpg"><img src="10437f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. Packaging
</p></div></div><p>
Finally, you have the choice of making your project publicly available. By
checking Make app public, your application will be added to the App
directory and be made available to users everywhere. This helps immensely
in distributing your application, because Titanium also hosts your files for
you. When you're done, click Package.
</p><p>
Titanium Developer then uploads your project files to the Packager Cloud
for packaging. When it's done, you are presented with links to your
downloads for each platform you specified. If you made your app public,
Titanium Developer also starts showing statistics for your
application, such as the number of downloads for each platform and the user
ratings for you application (Figure 10).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10437f10.large.jpg"><img src="10437f10.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

A Rich API for Rich Application Development</h2></div></div><p>
As you saw in the code above, all languages supported by Titanium have a
window object. This is the shared global object and is used to bind methods
and objects that need to be available on all languages. The main namespace
for the Titanium API is also bound to this global object and can be
accessed via window.Titanium.
</p><p>
Aside from WebKit goodies, such as client-side database storage and CSS
animations, Titanium's current API also contains many of the necessary
features needed for desktop application development:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Titanium.Desktop: for launching third-party applications and opening URLs
on the default browser.
</p></li><li><p>
Titanium.Filesystem: for working with the filesystem for things like reading and
writing files, creating and managing directories and so on.
</p></li><li><p>
Titanium.Media: for working with media files, such as audio and video.
</p></li><li><p>
Titanium.Network: for working with network-related tasks, such as socket
connections and IRC clients.
</p></li><li><p>
Titanium.Notification: for custom system notifications, as well as hooks
to platform-dependent notification systems like Growl and Snarl.
</p></li><li><p>
Titanium.Platform: for getting information about the user's system.
</p></li><li><p>
Titanium.Process: for working with system processes, as well as launching
and executing system commands.
</p></li><li><p>
Titanium.UI: for working with native windows, menus and system chrome.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Unfortunately, going over all of these APIs would require an article (or
two) in itself. Fortunately, the official Titanium site provides documentation 
with more details.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2363580.0x2856938"></a>
Getting Rich on the Desktop</h2></div></div><p>
Looking back, I wish that Titanium had already existed when my client asked me
to do that project to store voice files. It would have saved me a lot of
trouble fiddling with other solutions that couldn't truly satisfy the
requirements of real, rich desktop development.
</p><p>
The good thing is that Titanium already is here, ready for action.
You can download the SDK now, play with Titanium and join in on the
community discussions to learn more about it.
</p><p>
Yes, Titanium might be a relatively new project. However, with the rapid
rate of development I've seen so far, I'm planning to use Titanium to power
the next generation of better, and certainly more powerful, desktop
applications.
