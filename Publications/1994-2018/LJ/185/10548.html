Ksplice Uptrack Service</h2></div></div><p>
Across the pond at Germany's big LinuxTag event, Ksplice unveiled Ksplice
Uptrack, a new service that installs security and bug fixes on a running
kernel without rebooting. Ksplice, whose technology was developed
at MIT, claims to be the only solution that allows this application
of updates without rebooting. Currently available for Ubuntu 9.04,
Uptrack supports generic, virtual and server kernels. It also works
in VMware, Xen, Virtuozzo or other virtualized environments. Although the
initial release is a consumer-oriented solution, an enterprise solution
is expected in Q3 2009. [See the August 2009 issue for a feature article on
Ksplice.]

Fixstars' CodecSys CE-10 H.264 Encoder</h2></div></div><p>
The company Fixstars (formerly Terra Soft of Yellow Dog Linux fame)
keeps cranking out juicy goodies for the PS3 and other Cell-based
platforms. The latest solution is the CodecSys CE-10 product,
a faster-than-real-time H.264 video encoder that runs off a live
USB stick or CD on the Sony PS3 using a microversion of Yellow Dog
Linux as its live OS. In the solution, the PS3 acts as an external
accelerator, encoding video files sent from the host PC, replacing
expensive encoder cards and workstations. The PS3 is connected via
Gigabit cable. The H.264 format allows for compression to half the size
of MPEG2 for DVD and TV broadcasting while retaining equivalent quality.

Entuity's EYE NPE</h2></div></div><p>
Entuity's new network management solution, Eye of the Storm Network
Professional Edition (or EYE NPE for short) is now available.
The company says that EYE NPE offers &ldquo;enterprise functionality at a
price point previously reserved for workgroup-class tools&rdquo; and adds
&ldquo;revolutionary technology for the mid-market&rdquo; regarding automation,
accuracy and deep functionality. Other product advantages include
automatic surveying of networks in real time, an intelligent view of
object connectivity, root-cause analysis and a broad range of configurable
thresholds. Furthermore, rather than a device-centric approach, EYE NPE
includes user-configurable views that represent any logical collection
of devices or segmentation of the network. The solution runs on RHEL
Server, VMware ESX Server and Microsoft Windows Server.

mimio Studio</h2></div></div><p>
Just in at the education desk is mimio Studio 6, the latest release of
mimio's interactive teaching software. The application is one
element&mdash;together with the mimio Interactive System, a projector and mimio Ink
Capture Kit&mdash;in a system of presenting interactive lessons to students
in schools. One can interact directly with the system, as well as import
a wide variety of external media. New features in version 6 include
support for multimedia files, a gallery for fast lesson creation and a
slimmer toolbar. Interesting for us Linux geeks is that the system now works
with Linux and Mac OS in addition to Windows, enabling a lesson created
on one platform to run on all three.

CodeWeavers' CrossOver Linux, CrossOver Mac</h2></div></div><p>
Building on numerous improvements in the Wine Project, CodeWeavers
has released version 8.0 of its popular CrossOver Linux and CrossOver
Mac products. These products respectively transform Linux and Mac OS
X into Windows-compatible operating systems for selected applications.
Both products, says CodeWeavers, include support for Internet Explorer
7, Quicken 2009 and performance upgrades for Microsoft Office 2007,
particularly Outlook. In addition, users will find that many other
previously supported applications will run much faster and more stably.
The company further offers that all of its products are
significantly less expensive than the cost of a Windows license,
allowing users economically and legally to eliminate the need for
Microsoft Windows. (And there was much rejoicing.)

Opera Unite</h2></div></div><p>
The company Opera (of browser fame) says that its new Opera Unite is a
new technology that will shake up the old client-server computing model
of the Web and &ldquo;decentralize and democratize the cloud&rdquo;. Essentially,
Opera Unite is a Web server on the Web browser. It turns any computer
into both a client and a server, allowing it to interact with and serve
content to other computers directly across the Web, without the need for
third-party servers. For consumers, Opera Unite offers greater control
of private data and makes it easy to share data with any device equipped
with a Web browser. For Web developers, Opera Unite services are based on
open Web standards, and creating a full Web service is as easy as coding
a Web page. Currently, Opera Unite offers six services: file sharing,
Web server, media player, photo sharing, &ldquo;The Lounge&rdquo; chat service and
&ldquo;The Fridge&rdquo; message exchange.

Joe Hutsko's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Green Gadgets for Dummies</em></span> (Wiley)</h2></div></div><p>
Greening your gadgets and lifestyle can be not only fun but money-saving
as well. Such is the motto of Joe Hutsko's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Green Gadgets for
Dummies</em></span> from Wiley, a title billed as a friendly reference for exploring
the environmental and financial benefits of green gadgets. Green gadgets
encompass everything from iPods to energy-efficient home entertainment
devices to solar laptop chargers and crank-powered gizmos. The book
explains how to research green gadgets, calculate energy consumption,
make a smart purchasing decision, use products you already own in a more
environmentally friendly way, and bid farewell to electronics that zap
both energy and money. Finally, the book covers product labels and how
to avoid &ldquo;greenwashing&rdquo;&mdash;that is the overselling of environmental benefits.

CoroWare's Explorer</h2></div></div><p>
CoroWare Technologies announced the Explorer, an all-terrain robot
designed and optimized for conducting R&amp;D into new robotic applications
that operate in unstructured, outdoor environments. Built on a ruggedized
chassis, the Explorer functions well outside the lab, navigating rough
terrain and resisting environmental elements. The Explorer's camera,
wheel encoders and GPS enable the robot to examine the environment
while the fully articulated four-wheel drive ensures the Explorer can
navigate curbs, steps and inclines. By including a 2.0GHz PC-class
processor, 80GB disk storage space and Ubuntu Linux with support for
Player Project pre-installed, Explorer is ready to support any software
the developer desires. Explorer comes standard with four-wheel drive,
802.11n Wi-Fi, GPS and 1600x1200 color camera. Expansion capabilities
exist via extra USB, RS-232, digital I/O and analog inputs. Options
include wheel encoders, a pan/tilt/zoom camera and a 64-bit dual-core
motherboard.
