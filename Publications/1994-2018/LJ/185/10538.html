Three years ago, I devoted a couple columns (in the April and August 2006
issues of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>) to
Novell AppArmor, a partial implementation of Mandatory Access Controls
(MACs) that Novell had integrated into SUSE Linux as part of its acquisition
of Immunix. Novell also had released AppArmor's source code under the GPL.
I expressed hope that other distributions soon would offer AppArmor as an
easier-to-configure alternative to SELinux.
</p><p>
The good news is, during the three years since I wrote those articles, both
Ubuntu and Mandriva have incorporated AppArmor into their respective
distributions. Although until recently Ubuntu hasn't provided very much
documentation on its AppArmor port&mdash;one might even characterize
Ubuntu's
AppArmor adoption as stealthful&mdash;AppArmor actually has been in Ubuntu
since Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon). In fact, I mentioned this inclusion in
these very pages in the April 2008 issue, in my article &ldquo;Security Features in Ubuntu
Server&rdquo;.
</p><p>
At the time, I commented that due to its lack of AppArmor GUI
tools or documentation, AppArmor in Ubuntu 7.10 appeared to be targeted at
expert users. With Ubuntu 9.04, I'm happy to report that although AppArmor in
Ubuntu still is configured strictly via the command line, it's now amply
documented and comes with a useful set of default profiles.
</p><p>
The bad news is, in late 2007, Novell laid off all four of its full-time
AppArmor developers, raising serious questions about the future of AppArmor
(see The Future of AppArmor sidebar).
</p><p>
Being a security goon, I'm not optimistic by nature. However, I do believe
in making hay while the sun shines. If a compelling tool is available to
you in Ubuntu 9.04, you should take advantage of it and not worry about
whether that tool will be available in Ubuntu 11.04&mdash;unless, of course,
that tool requires an enormous investment in your time, attention and
thought.
</p><p>
But AppArmor, unlike most other MAC mechanism, is not such a tool. As I
explain in this month's overview of AppArmor in Ubuntu, for many
applications,
you don't need to do <span   class="emphasis"><em>anything</em></span> to enable or configure AppArmor
protection. For others, AppArmor essentially can train
<span   class="emphasis"><em>itself</em></span> in
protecting them.
</p><p>
So, let's take a look at AppArmor in Ubuntu.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ad580.0x2aa59e0"></a>
AppArmor Review</h2></div></div><p>
In case you missed my earlier articles on this topic, AppArmor is based on
the Linux Security Modules (LSMs), as is SELinux. AppArmor, however,
provides only a subset of the controls SELinux provides. Whereas SELinux
has methods for Type Enforcement (TE), Role-Based Access Controls (RBACs),
and Multi-Level Security (MLS), AppArmor provides only a form of Type
Enforcement.
</p><p>
Type Enforcement involves confining a given application to a specific set
of actions, such as writing to Internet network sockets, reading a specific
file and so forth. RBAC involves restricting user activity based on the
defined role, and MLS involves limiting access to a given resource based on
its data classification (or label).
</p><p>
By focusing on Type Enforcement, AppArmor provides protection against,
arguably, the most common Linux attack scenario&mdash;the possibility of an
attacker exploiting vulnerabilities in a given application that allows the
attacker to perform activities not intended by the application's developer
or administrator. By creating a baseline of expected application behavior
and blocking all activity that falls outside that baseline, AppArmor
(potentially) can mitigate even zero-day (unpatched) software
vulnerabilities.
</p><p>
What AppArmor <span   class="emphasis"><em>cannot</em></span> do, however, is prevent abuse of an
application's <span   class="emphasis"><em>intended</em></span> functionality. For example, the Secure Shell
d&aelig;mon, SSHD, is designed to grant shell access to remote users. If an
attacker figures out how to break SSHD's authentication by, for example,
entering just the right sort of gibberish in the user name field of an SSH
login session, resulting in SSHD giving the attacker a remote shell as some
authorized user, AppArmor may very well allow the attack to proceed, as
the attack's outcome is perfectly consistent with what SSHD would be
expected to do after successful login.
</p><p>
If, on the other hand, an attacker figured out how to make the CUPS
print services d&aelig;mon add a line to /etc/passwd that effectively creates a
new user account, AppArmor <span   class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> prevent that attack from succeeding,
because CUPS has no reason to be able to write to the file /etc/passwd.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ad580.0x2aa5da8"></a>
AppArmor on Ubuntu</h2></div></div><p>
In SUSE's and Ubuntu's AppArmor implementations, AppArmor comes with an
assortment of pretested profiles for popular server and client
applications and with simple tools for creating your own AppArmor
profiles. On Ubuntu systems, most of the pretested profiles are enabled by
default. There's nothing you need to do to install or enable them.
</p><p>
Other Ubuntu AppArmor profiles are installed, but set to run in complain
mode, in which AppArmor only logs unexpected application behavior to
/var/log/messages rather than both blocking and logging it. You either
can leave them that way, if you're satisfied with just using AppArmor as a watchdog
for those applications (in which case, you should keep an eye on
/var/log/messages), or you can switch them to enforce mode yourself,
although, of course, you should test thoroughly first.
</p><p>
Still other profiles are provided by Ubuntu's optional apparmor-profiles
package. Whereas ideally a given AppArmor profile should be incorporated
into its target application's package, for now at least,
apparmor-profiles is sort of a catchall for emerging and
not-quite-stable profiles that, for whatever reason, aren't appropriate to
bundle with their corresponding packages. 
</p><p>
Active AppArmor profiles reside in /etc/apparmor.d. The files at the root
of this directory are parsed and loaded at boot time automatically. The
apparmor-profiles package installs some of its profiles there, but puts
experimental profiles in /usr/share/doc/apparmor-profiles/extras.
</p><p>
The Ubuntu 9.04 packages shown in Table 1 put corresponding profiles into
/etc/apparmor.d.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x29ad580.0x2aa6010"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. Ubuntu Packages Having AppArmor Profiles</b></p><table     summary="Table 1. Ubuntu Packages Having AppArmor Profiles10538t1.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>

If you install the package apparmor-profiles, you'll additionally get

</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x29ad580.0x2a9d768"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 2. Packages Whose AppArmor Profiles Are Provided by

The lists in Tables 1 and 2 are perhaps as notable for what they lack as for what they
include. Although such high-profile server applications as BIND, MySQL, Samba,
NTPD and CUPS are represented, very notably absent are Apache, Postfix,
Sendmail, Squid and SSHD. And, what about important client-side network
tools like Firefox, Skype, Evolution, Acrobat and Opera?
</p><p>
Profiles for those applications and many more are provided by
apparmor-profiles in /usr/share/doc/apparmor-profiles/extras, but because
they reside there rather than /etc/apparmor.d, they're effectively
disabled. These profiles are disabled either because they haven't yet been
updated to work with the latest version of whatever package they protect
or because they don't yet provide enough protection relative to the Ubuntu
AppArmor team's concerns about their stability.
</p><p>
Testing and tweaking such profiles is beyond the scope of this article, but
suffice it to say, it involves the logprof command.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ad580.0x2a9edc0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
The Future of AppArmor</b></p><p>
AppArmor has been adopted as the default Mandatory Access Control solution
for both the Ubuntu and Mandriva distributions. I've sung its praises
before, and as evidenced by writing my now third column about it, clearly
I'm still a fan.
</p><p>
But, you should know that AppArmor's future is uncertain. In late 2007,
Novell laid off its full-time AppArmor developers, including project
founder Crispin Cowan (who subsequently joined Microsoft). 
</p><p>
Thus, Novell's commitment to AppArmor is open to question. It doesn't help
that the AppArmor Development Roadmap on Novell's Web site hasn't been
updated since 2006, or that Novell hasn't released a new version of
AppArmor since 2.3 Beta 1 in July 2008, nearly a year ago at the time of this
writing.
</p><p>
But, AppArmor's source code is GPL'd: with any luck, this apparent slack in
AppArmor leadership soon will be taken up by some other concerned
party&mdash;for example, Ubuntu and Mandriva developers. By incorporating AppArmor into
their respective distributions, the Ubuntu and Mandriva teams have both
committed to at least <span   class="emphasis"><em>patching</em></span> AppArmor against the inevitable bugs
that come to light in any major software package. 
</p><p>
Given this murky future, is it worth the trouble to use AppArmor? My answer
is an emphatic yes, for a very simple reason: AppArmor is so easy to
use&mdash;requiring no effort for packages already having distribution-provided
profiles and minimal effort to create new profiles&mdash;that there's no
reason not to take advantage of it for however long it remains an
officially supported part of your SUSE, Ubuntu or Mandriva system.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ad580.0x2a9f188"></a>
Creating AppArmor Profiles</h2></div></div><p>
At a high level, creating a new AppArmor profile involves creating a deny
all policy and then running that profile in complain (log-only) mode;
running your application in as typical a fashion as possible; using the
resulting log messages to loosen up the profile enough (but
<span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span>
enough) for the application to work properly; and setting the finished,
tuned profile to enforce mode.
</p><p>
AppArmor, through its genprof and logprof commands, walks you through this
entire process interactively. I'm not going to cover the process for
tweaking existing AppArmor profiles with logprof. logprof sessions are very
similar to genprof sessions, so if you're comfortable creating new
profiles, it's easy to tweak existing ones. (See Resources
for more information on the latter.)
</p><p>
So, let's walk through the process of creating a new AppArmor profile. For
this example scenario, let's start with a simple shell script,
spaztacle.sh, that could use some protection. 
Listing 1 shows the script itself.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ad580.0x2a9f3f0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. A Shell Script Needing AppArmor Protection</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
#
# spaztacle.sh : archives /var/spaetzle to specified tar-file

tar -cf $1 /var/spaetzle
</pre></div><p>
As you can see, this script allows users to create a backup archive of the
directory /var/spaetzle, using the archive filename specified in the
command line (for example, <tt  >spaztacle.sh mybackup.tar</tt>). To create an
AppArmor profile for it, run the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ sudo genprof spaztacle.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
What follows is an interactive question-and-answer session in which:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
genprof creates a new AppArmor profile for spaztacle.sh, containing a
simple &ldquo;deny all access&rdquo; policy.
</p></li><li><p>
genprof loads the new policy in complain mode and prompts you to
start the application in a separate window (this is your first opportunity
to demonstrate normal application activity to genprof).
</p></li><li><p>
After you've demonstrated the application sufficiently, genprof analyzes
the messages the new profile generated in /var/log/messages.
</p></li><li><p>
For each log message, genprof asks what sort of rule to add to your
new AppArmor profile to account for the behavior that was logged.
</p></li><li><p>
After all log messages have been analyzed, genprof allows you to repeat
the test/analyze cycle, which may or may not result in additional rules for
the profile.
</p></li><li><p>
When you're done with the testing/log-analyzing cycle, genprof saves the
profile and loads it in enforce mode. You're done!
</p></li></ol></div><p>
A full genprof session is too lengthy to list and dissect here, but we can
discuss some highlights from my <tt  >sudo genprof
spaztacle.sh</tt> session that
illustrate how the process works.
</p><p>
First, I'm asked whether genprof should query the AppArmor profile
repository at opensuse.org. I select d to disable repository access. 
</p><p>
Next, I'm prompted to run my application. So I open another xterm
window, and from my home directory, run the command <tt  >spaztacle.sh
arf.tar</tt>.
That command results in the file arf.tar being written in my home
directory, as expected.
</p><p>
Back in the genprof session, I type <tt  >s</tt> to begin scanning the system log
for AppArmor messages. genprof asks me whether and how to allow /bin/tar
to be executed. This, of course, is the core function of spaztacle.sh, so I
type <tt  >i</tt> to cause tar to be allowed,
&ldquo;inheriting&rdquo; the same profile as
spaztacle.sh itself.
</p><p>
Next, I'm asked whether to allow /bin/dash to run. Because spaztacle.sh is a
Bourne shell script, it needs to be interpreted by /bin/dash (on Ubuntu
9.04 /bin/sh actually is a symbolic link to /bin/dash). I type
<tt  >a</tt> to allow
/bin/dash to run.
</p><p>
Then, I'm asked whether spaztacle.sh may read itself&mdash;that is,
/usr/bin/spaztacle.sh. This is an expected part of the script-parsing
process; I type <tt  >a</tt>.
</p><p>
For now, there are no further log messages to process, so genprof prompts me
to save the tweaked profile and asks whether to scan for more events.
Before answering, I switch to my other xterm window, change my working
directory to /home/mick/Public, and run the command <tt  >spaztacle.sh
anothertar.tar</tt>.
</p><p>
Sure enough, back in the genprof session after I type
<tt  >s</tt> again, there's a
new set of &ldquo;complaints&rdquo; to process. The first concerns whether spaztacle.sh
(actually tar) can read /etc/group. I'm given the option of allowing access
only to /etc/group or of enabling the abstraction called nameservice.
</p><p>
Abstractions are groups of commonly accessed profile objects that
constitute common system functions and services, such as checking file
permissions, looking up hostnames and so forth. In this case, I select the
nameservice abstraction and type <tt  >a</tt> to allow it.
</p><p>
Next, genprof asks me whether to allow only write access to the (new) file
anothertar.tar, or to use some sort of wild card (&ldquo;glob&rdquo; in AppArmor
parlance). Because I want users to be able to create arbitrary tar archives
in their respective home directories, I type <tt  >n</tt> to
specify a new glob,
and specify <tt  >/home/**</tt>.
</p><p>
In AppArmor profiles, ** is a wild card that means &ldquo;any string, including
/&rdquo;. This is in contrast to *, which means &ldquo;any string up to and excluding
a / and anything after it&rdquo;. Therefore,
<tt  >/home/**</tt> means &ldquo;everything within
/home/, including all subdirectories of its subdirectories&rdquo;.
</p><p>
This implies that users might be able to write files to other users' home
directories, but AppArmor controls <span   class="emphasis"><em>augment</em></span> normal Linux filesystem
permissions; they don't <span   class="emphasis"><em>replace</em></span> them. In our example, therefore,
users will be able to write to other other users' directories only if those
directories' permissions are set accordingly.
</p><p>
In fact, our <tt  >/home/**</tt> rule actually
<span   class="emphasis"><em>reduces</em></span> the number of places
spaztacle.sh can create tar archives. Without this rule, spaztacle.sh can
write in <span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> directory in which the user executing it
has write
privileges, not just subdirectories of /home/.
</p><p>
There are just two more log entries to account for. One concerns
read access to /var/spaetzle. I type <tt  >a</tt> to allow this access. You might be
tempted to create a new glob instead,
<tt  >/var/spaetzle/**</tt>, but as it happens,
tar handles the directory itself and its contents separately.
</p><p>
Therefore, only <span   class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> creating the rule allowing access to
/var/spaetzle and being prompted for a decision on allowing access to the
file /var/spaetzle/arf.txt, will I type <tt  >n</tt>, create the new glob
<tt  >/var/spaetzle/**</tt> and allow access to it.
</p><p>
Finally, we've reached the end of the new AppArmor events in
/var/log/messages. When genprof asks me what to do after saving the changed
profile, I finish the genprof session. genprof puts my new profile into
enforce mode, reloads it and I'm done! Listing 2 shows the result,
/etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.spaztacle.sh.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ad580.0x2db40f0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. The Finished Profile</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

# Last Modified: Mon Jun 15 21:29:38 2009

  owner /home/** a,
  /usr/bin/spaztacle.sh r,
  /var/spaetzle/ r,
  /var/spaetzle/** r,

}

</pre></div><p>
Happily, if I run spaztacle.sh again, it still works. But, is AppArmor doing
anything? I can make sure the new profile is loaded with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ sudo aa-status
</pre>
</p><p>
Here's part of its output:

<pre     class="programlisting">
apparmor module is loaded.
26 profiles are loaded.
13 profiles are in enforce mode.
   /usr/sbin/clamd
   /usr/sbin/cupsd
   /usr/bin/spaztacle.sh
[...]
</pre>
</p><p>
Great! The spaztacle.sh profile is loaded in enforce mode. Besides
showing what profiles are loaded and in what mode, aa-status also lists
which processes are being protected actively. Because spaztacle.sh isn't
actually running at the moment, it doesn't turn up in aa-status' output as
an active process, but that's okay&mdash;normally you'd expect server
d&aelig;mons,
not commands per se, to turn up in that part of aa-status' output.
</p><p>
There's just one more test we'll do to see if AppArmor is doing its job.
The more astute among you may have noticed that there's a glaring flaw in
my little shell script (Listing 1). Because I didn't contain $1 in
quotation marks, it's possible for a mischievous user to execute
spaztacle.sh like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ spaztacle.sh "tarfile.tar /etc/apparmor.d/"
</pre>
</p><p>
When the tar command in spaztacle expands the command input, it will
correctly interpret tarfile.tar as the target file, but will include not
only /var/spaetzle but also /etc/apparmor.d/ in the tar archive! On the one
hand, local file permissions still apply. This works only if users in
question have read access to /etc/apparmor.d, which means that although
they're tricking spaztacle.sh, they aren't copying anything they'd
otherwise be unable to get at.
</p><p>
But on the other hand, this is <span   class="emphasis"><em>unexpected</em></span> behavior for my unfortunate
script. I don't want users to be able to include arbitrary directories in
their authorized backups of /var/spaetzle.
</p><p>
So I'm glad to see that if I actually try running spaztacle.sh that way
with my new AppArmor profile in enforce mode, this is the result: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar: /etc/apparmor.d: Cannot open: Permission denied
tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors
</pre>
</p><p>
The following message also has been written to /var/log/messages:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Jun 16 01:17:43 micksbox kernel: [57354.414567] type=1503
audit(1245133063.520:1004): operation="inode_permission"
requested_mask="::r" denied_mask="::r" 
fsuid=1000 name="/etc/apparmor.d/"
pid=28019 profile="/usr/bin/spaztacle.sh"
</pre>
</p><p>
Success! AppArmor has correctly identified bad behavior on spaztacle.sh's
part. And, the intended tar file (tarfile.tar) not only was created, it
also
contains the backup of /var/spaetzle that I <span   class="emphasis"><em>did</em></span> want the user to be
able to create&mdash;only the unexpected part of spaztacle.sh's activity was
blocked. Success indeed!

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Using genprof may seem a little involved, but the man pages for genprof,
logprof and apparmor.d explain most of what you need to know. The
tutorials listed in Resources should be helpful too. I hope I've
covered enough here to get you started using AppArmor on your own Ubuntu
system!
