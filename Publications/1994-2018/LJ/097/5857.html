    Doc contemplates the geology of the West as a metaphor for
    Linux's role in the infrastructure of the civilized world.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2954580.0x2a4c450"></a></h2></div></div><p>I'm writing from the business class cabin
of a United 777 en route from Chicago to Los Angeles. To my left is
an LCD display that pulls out of the armrest. On screen is a map
that tells me what I'm seeing out the window here on the right side
of the plane.</p><p>The map scrolls a series of views, like you get in a flight
simulator program. Right now it says we're heading toward the
Rockies across Fort Collins, north of Denver, Colorado. About 30
miles to the right is Cheyenne, Wyoming, a flat pattern of streets
and buildings surrounding the runways of an airport. The town
spreads around a convergence of highways and railroads, drawn in
faint lines across a landscape worn flat by almost constant winds.
The story of the land's geology is told again by snow, which
appears to be swept poorly by a gigantic broom, brushing northwest
to southeast across endless stretches of ranches and farms.</p><p>We pass over the Front Range, the Medicine Bows, the Sierra
Madres. In the distance I see the Big Horns, the Uintas&mdash;all rough
features embossed on the sky above by forces below. Not many
millions of years ago much of the scene out this window would have
been as flat as Nebraska, but as the mountains came up under the
plains, the soft soils were &ldquo;de-roofed&rdquo;, perhaps more by wind
than by the rivers whose work is far more obvious. Even from up
here you can see why they say a Wyoming weathervane is an anvil on
a chain.</p><p>I take more than a passing interest in all this because I've
been steeping myself for the last several years in the works of
John McPhee, who does for geology what Shakespeare does for
love&mdash;except the virtues of geology are not so self-evident. To
McPhee, no rock has a story too dull to tell, which he proves, page
after page, book after book. McPhee's series of books on American
geology were only slightly condensed in 1998 into one fat work
titled <span   class="emphasis"><em>Annals of the Former World</em></span>. It won the
Pulitzer it deserved. My favorite McPhee book is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Rising
from the Plains</em></span>, which weaves two tales into one: the
story of Wyoming's deep past and of geologist David Love, who has
lived through the last 89 years of it. &ldquo;A geological map is a
textbook on one sheet of paper&rdquo;, McPhee writes. And David Love,
who grew up on a hardscrabble ranch in the very center of the
state, was the primary author of both the 1955 and 1985 editions of
the Geological Survey's Wyoming maps. He researched them mostly on
foot and guesses he has spent a quarter of his life sleeping
outside.</p><p>What draws me to people like McPhee and Love is the sense of
grounded perspective they give us on a topic that should become
increasingly fundamental as both Linux and the computer industry
mature. That topic is infrastructure&mdash;or, to use a label I prefer,
interstructure. I'm talking here about our base-level computing and
communications environments. Linux is down there, sitting on top of
the deeper and more universal environment we call the Internet.
It's infrastructural stuff. Every piece of code we add or change
lithifies into solid material we use to build the civilized
world.</p><p>In geology the term <span   class="emphasis"><em>competent</em></span> refers to
rock that's dependable. You can build a house on it or with it, and
you can trust that it won't break if you climb a steep surface of
it. It also has nothing to hide about itself. The same goes for
code. Infrastructural code is naturally competent. It is also both
open to examination and improvement. The intellectual and creative
processes by which we improve infrastructural code are no less
natural than the geological forces that turn granite into gneiss,
limestone into marble and peridotite into serpentine.</p><p>Competence has another aspect. Here's David Love: &ldquo;Human
environment, good and bad, starts with the rock, coupled with the
other two major necessities, water and air. Ruin one of these three
basic essentials and humanity is in deep trouble.&rdquo; Now substitute
&ldquo;Internet&rdquo; for &ldquo;rock&rdquo; and &ldquo;computing&rdquo; for &ldquo;humanity&rdquo;, and
Love's point starts to come home.</p><p>Infrastructure is what we depend on. And because it is
naturally common and abundant, a large number of us understand how
it works and what it's good for.</p><p>Explaining why the government of China decided to create its
own Linux distribution, Red Flag, Matei Mihalca, head of internet
research, Asia-Pacific for Merrill Lynch, points to Linux's
&ldquo;transparency&rdquo;. This is the inherent infrastructural advantage
Linux enjoys over Windows. Even if Windows becomes 100% reliable,
the reasons why will remain opaque as long as the source code
remains closed. Build all you want with it, but don't ask it to
serve as bedrock.</p><p>This doesn't mean there's no room for commercial developers
in the business of making infrastructural bedrock. Dave Winer, the
commercial developer behind SOAP and XML-RPC (both open-source
protocols) says, &ldquo;Ask not what the Internet can do for you, ask
what you can do for the Internet.&rdquo; Constantly improving Linux is
one answer to that question.</p><p>Now the little map tells me we're starting to head past Las
Vegas, which looks like a waffle pattern etched almost decoratively
on the flat desert floor. In <span   class="emphasis"><em>Basin and Range</em></span>,
John McPhee explains that the mountains of Nevada were mostly
formed by extension: the distance between Salt Lake City and San
Francisco is increasing, opening up. This started recently, in the
Miocene, only about eight million years ago. The crust here has
been spreading and breaking apart, and the heavier edges of each
block have been sinking into the mantle while the lighter edges
have floated up to form mountain ranges. Between them basins have
opened and filled with erosional debris.</p><p>Many of Nevada's basins were recently also at the bottom of
Lake Lahontan, a body of water as blue and subarctic as any in
northern Canada. Many of today's ranges were islands in Lahontan's
midst. Lahontan evaporated as the Sierra Nevada pushed out of
California's deeps, casting a rain shadow to the east and starving
Lahontan and its surrounding lakes of water. The last ice age ended
ten thousand years ago, but the Earth continues to warm, leaving
vast dry puddles where Lahontan and other Nevada lakes used to be.
Las Vegas now reposes, oblivious to the coming deposits of mountain
ranges eroding all around it.</p><p>As we begin our descent into Los Angeles, I find myself
thinking that in the long run&mdash;in the period required for computing
infrastructure to lithify&mdash;the real fight will not be between Linux
and Windows, but between those who respect the nature of
infrastructure and those who don't. Those who respect it see the
Internet is the only platform worthy of the noun. Those who don't
respect it see the Net as yet another plumbing system. Our fight
with them will be over regulation intended to protect business
models that require control over a plumbing system that the
Internet's efficiencies threaten to obsolete. But we'll win,
because nature will be on our side.</p></div></div>
