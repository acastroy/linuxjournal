    This month David considers antitrust legislation and the
    possibly bleak future of Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f6f580.0x2067558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Well, those of you who thought the days
of the robber barons were over haven't been paying attention&mdash;looks
like Microsoft has gone from the software industry into politics.
They steamrolled and bullied, and when that didn't work they bought
out their competition. And they just found out it works like a
charm in political circles too, increasing their $150,000/year in
political contributions to over $6.1 million (and buying a lot of
influence with that money). I hate to say it folks, but hundreds of
millions of our tax dollars have been wasted in antitrust
legislation just to subsidize even stronger Microsoft control of
the software industry.</p><p>But Microsoft leaves no stone unturned. They &ldquo;give away&rdquo;
software to schools. The price tag is if you want Microsoft for
free, you can't run/teach any other operating systems&mdash;looks like
our children will be saying the pledge of allegiance to Microsoft.
And it's not just happening in the US, it's happening everywhere
Microsoft sticks its foot in the door. I am certain these deals
have been struck with Canadian schools, Australian schools, even
South African schools. Microsoft is bound and determined that in
five years or less, the only operating system in the world will be
theirs. After the incredibly expensive and embarrassing fiasco
called an antitrust trial, their stranglehold on the industry will
be stronger in the coming years than anyone's nightmares imagined.
Our children will learn Microsoft programs and operating systems
exclusively. OEMs will revert to offering only Microsoft because
that's all folks will order. Because when you get one order for a
Linux system and over 10,000 orders for Microsoft, it doesn't pay
to preload anything else (and unless a court orders OEMs to offer
systems with no OS, they <span   class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> come
preloaded).</p><p>I also foresee many more useless lawsuits. So I declare the
winners of the US antitrust case against Microsoft to be first, the
lawyers and second, Microsoft. The losers are everyone else (unless
you happen to be a Microsoft stockholder). In another ten years
Linux will be just another memory. Pessimistic? No, realistic. Our
courts and elected officials have failed in their duties. And until
yet another antitrust lawsuit is won against Microsoft (it will be
the third time), things will only get worse. But perhaps the third
time (if it ever happens) will be the charm, and innovation and
freedom of choice can return to the software industry. I'm not
holding my breath. Good guys too often finish last.</p><p>Axel
<a href="http://www.lintux.cx/axel.html" target="_self">www.lintux.cx/axel.html</a></p><p>This utility claims to be a download accelerator. I don't
want to get into the debate about accelerating downloads, but the
program can run single or multithreaded (opening
<span   class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> number of connections to a server). Whether
the downloads are faster or not, and in which mode, is for you to
decide. What I know is that this utility is very small compared to
some others. Requires: libpthread, glibc.</p><p>axelq
<a href="http://electron.its.tudelft.nl/~hemmin98/axelq.html" target="_self">electron.its.tudelft.nl/~hemmin98/axelq.html</a></p><p>The Axel utility mentioned above has no queue to permit you
to store URLs for later download. This adjunct allows you to do
that and run Axel at a later date against a list of URLs. If you
want to run Axel, then you'll also want this utility. Requires:
/bin/sh.</p><p>integrit
<a href="http://integrit.sourceforge.net" target="_self">integrit.sourceforge.net</a></p><p>This particular application compares itself to the likes of
Tripwire and AIDE. As another tool in monitoring your system, it
works well enough. It is simple to use and can be set up to check
your system against changes to key files or directories. Requires:
(integrit is built statically, so requires no runtime libs).</p><p>nmbscan
<a href="http://gbarbier.free.fr/prj/dev/#nmbscan" target="_self">gbarbier.free.fr/prj/dev/#nmbscan</a></p><p>If your network has a mix of Windows and Linux/UNIX, you can
use this to take a quick look at the local network. It is a simple
shell script that makes use of the network tools on your system to
identify Windows hosts, Samba servers and provide as much
information as possible regarding the Windows side of your network.
Requires: /bin/sh, smbclient, nmblookup, arp, host, ping.</p><p>myPhile
<a href="http://www.rni.net/~geoffm" target="_self">www.rni.net/~geoffm</a></p><p>This is an extremely simple, yet versatile front end to just
about any MySQL database to which you care to connect. Newly
installed, it creates a small database address book. It is easily
modified for your own purposes and is usable by a small company
with few changes and almost no training. It's worth a look if you
need a quick and simple address book for the masses. Requires: web
server with PHP, web browser.</p><p>Jmol
<a href="http://www.openscience.org/jmol" target="_self">www.openscience.org/jmol</a></p><p>If you're a college student with chemistry courses that
require you to model molecules, this program is great. I remember
having to do such modeling (not a few years ago) with a tinker-toy
set that looked like jacks with plastic straws. But this program
will let you do everything short of touch the model. It comes with
many samples, or you can look for the compound you need on the Web.
This program supports a lot of different format files for chemical
compounds. Requires: Java.</p><p>GRPN
<a href="http://lashwhip.com/grpn.html" target="_self">lashwhip.com/grpn.html</a></p><p>This month's choice from three years ago was frustrating.
Keystone was sold to WhitePajamas and abandoned, and most other
choices showed little, if any, improvements. While not a favorite
of mine from the past, as some others have been, I choose GRPN.
Probably not a lot of us remember Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)
anymore, but it was used in many calculators, and if I remember
correctly, almost all scientific calculators. If you like RPN, then
this calculator is for you. It handles general math functions,
exponential and logarithmic functions, and trigonometric functions.
Requires: libgtk, libgdk, libmodule, libglib, libdl, libXext,
libX11, libm, glibc. Until next month.</p></div></div>
