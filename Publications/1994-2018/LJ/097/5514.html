    Howard provides an introduction to Cystal Space, and
    open-source alternative to commercial 3-D graphics engines.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x217b580.0x2273818"></a></h2></div></div><p>Want to make a 3-D graphics game or
application? First, you will need a 3-D graphics software engine on
which to build it. Traditionally, your choices have been limited to
programming your own from scratch or paying a high licensing fee to
use another company's, which can restrict what you do with your
final product commercially.</p><p>However, a third alternative exists: Crystal Space, an
open-source 3-D graphics engine created by 31-year-old Belgian
programmer, Jorrit Tyberghein.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5514f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
An Indoor Environment Rendered with Crystal Space
</p></div></div><p>Tyberghein created Crystal Space in 1997 after seeing games
like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span> and
wondering how they were made. With no prior experience in graphics
coding, he researched the Internet on 3-D graphics programming and
put together the first version of Crystal Space in two months.
Tyberghein released the code as open source, and the Crystal Space
development community soon was born. The graphics engine has since
been ported from its original Linux code to UNIX, Windows 32-bit
and NT and other OSes.</p><p>Most of the software currently being made with Crystal Space
are role-playing games. The fact that the engine includes full
control of one or more camera perspectives and has built-in support
for networking makes it easier to develop multiplayer games, like
role players. There are also flight simulators, real-time strategy
games and first-person shooters, similar to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span> or <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span>, under
development using the engine.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5514f2.large.jpg"><img src="5514f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
A Test Application Showing Several Features of the Crystal Space
</p></div></div><p>As for how Crystal Space compares to commercial 3-D graphics
engines, specifically those that power games like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake
III</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Unreal Tournament</em></span>,
presently it is comparable in terms of specific graphics features
but not in regard to code readiness and performance speed. But in
general, Crystal Space is much richer because it is not just a
game-specific engine. It is also a general-purpose graphics API,
and it is being put to use to drive applications like a multimedia
internet browser, a sound-editing program and an image
viewer.</p><p>Andrew Zabolotny, a 28-year-old programmer from St.
Petersburg, Russia, who has been contributing to Crystal Space's
high-level coding says: &ldquo;We have lots of things
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span> or <span   class="emphasis"><em>Unreal</em></span> will
never need because a first-person shooter is a very specific type
of game that needs just a limited set of features.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x217b580.0x2274108"></a>Crystal Space's Features: the Good and the
Bad</h2></div></div><p>Developers who have been working with Crystal Space cite the
engine's stability (it rarely crashes) and the completeness of its
3-D-rendering features as reasons for using it and contributing to
its development.</p><p>Yet how necessary is a 3-D graphics engine these days,
considering the advanced and powerful 3-D graphics chipsets that
have become a standard feature in most PCs? The simple answer is
that even with the best 3-D technology, you still need a software
engine to manage what the hardware is doing.</p><p>&ldquo;There is always a limit to what hardware can do&rdquo;, says
Tyberghein, Crystal Space's creator. &ldquo;Even the best hardware
cannot handle millions or more polygons just by rendering them all.
So an engine still has to do some optimization to limit what is
sent to the hardware.&rdquo;</p><p>For example, a software engine like Crystal Space is needed
to determine quickly which parts of a game's virtual environment
are visible to the user. This helps to maximize the performance of
the 3-D chipset by not wasting its resources in making it render an
object that will not actually appear on the monitor, even if it is
supposed to exist (though off-camera, away from the user's point of
view) within the virtual environment.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5514f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Example Environment Created with Crystal Space's Landscape
</p></div></div><p>Crystal Space is free under LGPL. This 3-D game development
kit written in C++ supports numerous graphics features and fancy
effects: true six degrees of freedom; colored lighting; mipmapping;
portals; mirrors; alpha transparency; reflective surfaces;
frame-based and skeletal-animated 3-D sprites; procedural textures;
radiosity; particle systems; halos; volumetric fog; scripting using
Python or other languages; 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit display
support; Direct3D, OpenGL and software graphics rendering; font
support; and hierarchical transformations, to list only a
few.</p><p>Although it cannot match graphics engines like
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake III</em></span>'s or <span   class="emphasis"><em>Unreal
Tournament</em></span>'s in performance, Crystal Space has its own
advantages over them: for one, it is cross-platform, so you can
write code that will run equally well on Linux, UNIX, Windows
32-bit, Windows NT and seven other OSes to which the engine has
been ported.</p><p>Crystal Space has a flexible plugin system so that a single
executable works with various renderers like OpenGL, Direct3D and
Glide. Since the first release of the engine, the OpenGL renderer
in particular has been rewritten and runs a lot faster than in its
previous incarnation.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5514f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
A Starship Flying toward Earth in a Scene Rendered in Real Time
</p></div></div><p>Also important is that Crystal Space can read many 3-D
graphics file formats automatically. There are several importers
supporting various 3-D formats (such as 3DS, OBJ, MDL, MD2, LWO and
ASE). Inversely, the engine has a set of Python scripts so that
environments and models can be exported to Crystal Space from
within Blender.</p><p>Although the primary purpose of the engine is to produce 3-D
graphics, it even has a 2-D API to go along with its 3-D API. &ldquo;I
wrote a full-blown windowing GUI based entirely on the Crystal
Space low-level API&rdquo;, says Zabolotny.</p><p>Pieces of separate code even can be used outside of Crystal
Space in projects unrelated to game or multimedia development.
These include a csIniFile class (for .ini file management), an SCF
(shared class facility) subsystem, a csArchive class (which deals
with .zip files) and a VFS (virtual filesystem) subsystem.</p><p>The most significant weakness of Crystal Space is its lack of
good collision detection programming. Thomas Hieber, who has been
developing Crystal Shooter, a first-person shooter, with Crystal
Space, has been spending most of his time improving the engine's
capabilities in this area. &ldquo;There is some support in it, but it is
not very useful for games&rdquo;, says the 30-year-old software engineer
from Germany. &ldquo;There is only static testing of
object-against-object that basically will return information about
where the collision occurs, if any. But there is no good support
for fast-moving objects.&rdquo;</p><p>Another complicated issue is how Crystal Space handles
lighting. It supports colored static and dynamic lighting with soft
shadows, but getting these to work fast under all possible game
processing circumstances is a challenge and one which Crystal Space
currently does not totally meet.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5514f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

contribute. Tyberghein is looking for people who are skilled in
programming graphic engine internals and adept in algorithmic
thinking&mdash;essentially those who can help fine-tune the performance
of the core engine itself. &ldquo;I have lots of people helping on the
other parts of Crystal Space (i.e., OpenGL and Direct3D
programming, Windows and Linux porting) but very few people are
capable of helping me with the engine&rdquo;, he says.</p><p>&ldquo;If we had more good programmers, we could do much more&rdquo;,
Zabolotny says. &ldquo;We primarily need people skilled in
cross-platform C/C++ programming.&rdquo;</p><p>As of this writing, the primary goal for the Crystal Space
team is achieving API-stability. &ldquo;Our development version is now
rather stable, but there are still a few things to do&rdquo;, says
Tyberghein. The current release of Crystal Space, 0.90, serves as a
predecessor to the long-awaited 1.0 release. The API between 0.90
and 1.0 should be nearly the same, but the release of 0.90 is meant
to facilitate bug hunting and documentation writing.</p><p>One of the enhancements in 0.90 being tested is a revamped
landscape-rendering engine that is more tightly and better
integrated within Crystal Space's code than it was in previous
versions. There are several new special effects that the graphics
engine can draw, like hazes and lens flares, and there is the
addition of a particle-rendering system. On a technical level,
Crystal Space's tools have been made much more modular and simpler
to access. More plugins and code, which were previously available
in separate libraries, have been incorporated.</p><p>Ultimately, could Crystal Space ever evolve to the point
where it has what it takes for commercial game development and
become as widely used as proprietary 3-D graphics engines? Even
Tyberghein expresses doubts:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>If you license the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake III</em></span>
engine, then you're sure to get a quality product that will work.
So if you want technical support, you should not use a free engine.
However, if you feel like you can cope with the lack of support, or
if funding is a problem, then an open-source engine is for
you.</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5514f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Stars Rendered with Crystal Space's Particle Animation System
</p></div></div><p>Hieber concedes that &ldquo;Crystal Space is miles away from
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake III</em></span>&rdquo;, but he does not believe this will
hinder anyone from making great games with Crystal Space. It is,
after all, well designed, though it doesn't necessarily have
powerful technologies, which affect the quality of games. &ldquo;Look at
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tomb Raider</em></span> or
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Half-Life</em></span>&rdquo;, he points out. &ldquo;Neither has a
really great 3-D engine, but they all have been successful because
of the value of their game play.&rdquo;</p><p>Visit the Crystal Space site at
