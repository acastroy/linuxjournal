to the linux-kernel mailing list: &ldquo;Linus Torvalds has requested a
moratorium on new device number assignments. His hope is that a new
and better method for device space handling will emerge as a
result.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter is the &ldquo;Linux Assigned Names and Numbers Authority&rdquo;,
meaning that all kernel driver authors had to go through him to get
a major and minor number pair for their drivers. The freeze on
assigning new numbers naturally caused a lot of discussion about
what this &ldquo;better method&rdquo; for device space handling would be. One
idea that emerged was making a driver that could implement a
filesystem to control the user-space interaction with the
driver.</p><p>During this time, I was cleaning up the PCI Hot Plug driver
written by Compaq for their servers. A PCI Hot Plug driver allows
you to shut down a PCI card while the machine is running, pull out
the card, replace it with another one and then power that card back
on, if you have the proper hardware on your motherboard. This is
very useful for servers that cannot be shut down but need to have
new network cards added, faulty devices removed and other
service-type operations.</p><p>The PCI Hot Plug driver was originally written to interact
with user space as a character device; ioctl calls were made to the
device node to shut down PCI slots, power up PCI slots, turn PCI
slot indicator lights on and off and run different manufacturing
tests on the device. To get information about the number of
different PCI slots in the system and the state of the slots (power
and indicator status), a /proc directory tree was used. This
directory tree was read-only.</p><p>As I worked to split the PCI Hot Plug core functionality out
of the Compaq driver, so that other PCI Hot Plug drivers would have
a common interface for the user, I realized that a single
filesystem would be a better fit both to show PCI-slot information
and to allow user control. All information and control over the
driver would be handled from one place, instead of having two
different types of interfaces.</p><p>The PCI Hot Plug driver core has been merged into the main
kernel tree as of 2.4.15, and it exports a filesystem called
pcihpfs that is used to control the driver. When you mount the
filesystem, you get a tree with directories called 3, 4, 5 and so
on, which are the physical numbers of the PCI slots. Every file in
a slot directory can be read to find the value for that bit of
information about the slot. The files power and attention can be
written to in order to set the power (0 or 1) or attention (0 or 1)
values. The test file is used to send hardware test commands to the
hardware. The adapter file detects if an adapter is present in that
slot or not, and the latch file describes the position of the
physical latch (if any) for that slot.</p><p>So, you can enable the power in slot 5 to be turned
with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo 1 &gt; 5/power
</pre><p>from the pcihpfs root. If a PCI card is present in that slot,
the whole PCI-initialization sequence will execute for that card,
including a call out to /sbin/hotplug with the PCI information, so
that the module for that device can be loaded automatically by the
system [see Greg's Kernel Korner in the June 2002 issue of
<i  >LJ</i>].</p><p>Because of this filesystem, a user-space program does not
have to make special ioctl() calls to a character device, allowing
users to access a wider range of options for how they want to
control their devices.</p><p>The rest of this article describes how the PCI Hot Plug core
implements a RAM-based filesystem and how you can do the same thing
for your drivers.</p><p>First, you need to declare the filesystem in your driver. To
do this, use the DECLARE_FSTYPE macro, which is defined in the
include/linux/file.h file. The pci_hotplug driver uses the
DECLARE_FSTYPE macro in the following way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
static DECLARE_FSTYPE(pcihpfs_fs_type, "pcihpfs",
          pcihpfs_read_super, FS_SINGLE | FS_LITTER);
</pre><p>This creates a static variable of the type struct
file_system_type called pcihpfs_fs_type and initializes some of the
structure's fields. The name field is set to pcihpfs, which will be
used by users in mounting our filesystem, so choose a name that
makes sense and is not currently in use by any other filesystem in
the kernel. We set the flags field to both FS_SINGLE and
FS_LITTER.</p><p>FS_SINGLE means that, for this filesystem, we will have only
one instance of the superblock. Therefore, wherever the filesystem
is mounted in the system, all mountpoints will point to the same
location in the filesystem (remember that you can mount the same
filesystem at different points in a directory tree). The FS_LITTER
option means that we want this filesystem to keep the tree in the
dcache. This is set because our filesystem will live entirely in
RAM and will not have a backing store of the data on any physical
device, like a disk.</p><p>The read_super field of the pcihpfs_fs_type points to the
function that will be called when the kernel wants to read the
superblock of our filesystem. A superblock is the structure in a
filesystem that is used to describe the entire filesystem. The
kernel will call this function when the filesystem is asked to be
mounted. When this function is called, we need to tell the kernel
exactly what our filesystem looks like.</p><p>But before our filesystem can be mounted, we need to tell the
kernel that our filesystem is present. This is done with a simple
call to register_filesystem() with our file_system_type as the only
parameter. This is done in the pci_hotplug module's initialization
function with the following bit of code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dbg("registering filesystem.\n");
result = register_filesystem(&amp;pcihpfs_fs_type);
if (result) {
  err("register_filesystem failed with %d\n", result);
  goto exit;
}
</pre><p>Likewise, when the pci_hotplug module is being shut down, we
unregister our filesystem type with the following single line of
code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
unregister_filesystem(&amp;pcihpfs_fs_type);
</pre><p>Right after we register our filesystem, we want to create
some virtual files that will allow a user to read and write values
that our driver wants to export and change. If a user mounts the
filesystem before he or she wants to create a file, the kernel
already will have created the filesystem at some virtual location.
Odds are that the filesystem has not been mounted, however, right
after it is created, we need to get the kernel to mount the
filesystem before we can add a file (otherwise our file creation
fails, which prevents anyone from using that file).</p><p>There are two different ways of solving this problem. The
first way is to wait until our filesystem is really mounted (we
know this when our read_super function is called) and then create
all of our files. This method requires us to do a bunch of work at
mount time and to be constantly aware of whether our filesystem is
currently mounted; remember, we need to add or remove files at
different points in time. The usbdevfs filesystem (no relation to
devfs, just an unfortunate name similarity) is an example of a
filesystem that implements this solution to the problem.</p><p>However, we don't want to keep track constantly of when our
filesystem is mounted, and we would like to be able to create or
remove a file whenever we want. To do this second method, we need
to tell the kernel to mount our filesystem internally. This solves
the problem of keeping track of the current mount state. Listing 1
shows how we accomplish this.</p><p><a href="5633l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Telling the Kernel to
Mount the Filesystem Internally</a></p><p>Let's walk through Listing 1 to try to understand what it is
doing and how it is doing it. This is also a good example of how to
do proper locking techniques for when the kernel is running on a
multiple-processor machine.</p><p>First we grab a spin lock, called mount_lock, with the
line</p><pre     class="programlisting">
spin_lock(&amp;mount_lock);
</pre><p>This lock is used to protect our internal count if our
filesystem is an example of what is needed to do this properly.
internally mounted. Okay, previously I stated that we didn't want
to keep track of whether we were mounted. Trust me, this simple
function, combined with a simple function to unmount the filesystem
(described later), is much easier to understand and work with than
is the option of trying to determine if we have been mounted by a
user. For an example of what is needed to do this properly, see the
code in drivers/usb/inode.c in the 2.4.18 and earlier
kernels.</p><p>After we grab our spin lock, check to see if our internal
mount variable has been set:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if (pcihpfs_mount) {
        mntget(pcihpfs_mount);
        ++pcihpfs_mount_count;
        spin_unlock (&amp;mount_lock);
        goto go_ahead;
}
</pre><p>If it has been set, we call mntget() to increment our
internal mount count; mntget() is a simple inline function in the
include/linux/mount.h file. We then increment our internal count
variable, unlock our spin lock and jump to the end of the function,
as we are finished (yes, it's okay to use
<span   class="bold"><b>goto</b></span> in the kernel,
sparingly).</p><p>Otherwise, we have not mounted this filesystem yet. So we
unlock our spin lock:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
spin_unlock (&amp;mount_lock);
</pre><p>and call kern_mount to mount our filesystem
internally:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mnt = kern_mount (&amp;pcihpfs_fs_type);
if (IS_ERR(mnt)) {
    err ("could not mount the fs...erroring out!\n");
    return -ENODEV;
}
</pre><p>We unlock our spin lock, as the kern_mount() function can
take a long time and may even cause the kernel to sleep and
schedule another process. Remember that you cannot hold a spin lock
if schedule() can be called while the lock is held&mdash;very bad things
can happen if you do this.</p><p>Now that we have mounted our filesystem, we grab our spin
lock again:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
spin_lock (&amp;mount_lock);
</pre><p>and check to see if our internal mount variable is still
zero:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if (!pcihpfs_mount) {
        pcihpfs_mount = mnt;
        ++pcihpfs_mount_count;
        spin_unlock (&amp;mount_lock);
        goto go_ahead;
}
</pre><p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;, you are saying. &ldquo;Why are we looking at
pcihpfs_mount? We already know that it is set to zero; we checked
it just a few lines of code ago. Why check again?&rdquo; Well, remember
the call to kern_mount() that we mentioned could sleep? If our call
to kern_mount() sleeps, and another process comes through this same
piece of code (remember we are running on more than one processor,
and multiple user threads could be happening at the same time),
then it could have already successfully mounted our filesystem and
incremented the pcihpfs_mount variable. Because of this, we need to
check it again.</p><p>So if another process has not come through and mounted our
filesystem, we save off the pointer to our now mounted filesystem
for other functions to use later, increment our internal count,
unlock our lock and exit.</p><p>But if another process already has mounted our filesystem, we
then do:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mntget(pcihpfs_mount);
++pcihpfs_mount_count;
spin_unlock (&amp;mount_lock);
mntput(mnt);
</pre><p>This matches what we originally did in this same situation,
back at the beginning of the function.</p><p>The code to unmount our filesystem is much simpler:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
static void remove_mount (void)
{
       struct vfsmount *mnt;
       spin_lock (&amp;mount_lock);
       mnt = pcihpfs_mount;
       --pcihpfs_mount_count;
       if (!pcihpfs_mount_count)
              pcihpfs_mount = NULL;
       spin_unlock (&amp;mount_lock);
       mntput(mnt);
       dbg("pcihpfs_mount_count = %d\n",
           pcihpfs_mount_count);
}
</pre><p>In this function, we simply grab our lock (the same lock we
used when mounting the filesystem), decrease our count of the
number of times the filesystem was mounted (we need to unmount for
every time we mounted it) and unlock our lock. Then we tell the
kernel that we want to unmount the filesystem with a call to
mntput().</p><p>When the kernel wants to mount our filesystem&mdash;virtually
because we called kern_mount() or because a user mounted it
first&mdash;our pcihpfs_read_super() function is called. In it, we need
to set up a few kernel structures that describe what our filesystem
looks like and list where to find the functions that the kernel
will call during the lifetime of the filesystem. This is done with
the following lines of code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sb-&gt;s_blocksize = PAGE_CACHE_SIZE;
sb-&gt;s_blocksize_bits = PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT;
sb-&gt;s_magic = PCIHPFS_MAGIC;
sb-&gt;s_op = &amp;pcihpfs_ops;
</pre><p>With this, we state that our filesystem's block size is equal
to the page cache size; we set up our filesystem's magic number
(must be unique across all filesystems in the system) and point to
our list of super_operations structure functions.</p><p>Then we initialize the superblock's root inode by
doing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
inode = pcihpfs_get_inode(sb, S_IFDIR | 0755, 0);
if (!inode) {
      dbg("%s: could not get inode!\n",__FUNCTION__);
      return NULL;
}
</pre><p>We will describe what pcihpfs_get_inode() does in a bit, but
if that succeeds, we then allocate the root dentry for the inode we
just created and save that dentry in the superblock
structure:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
root = d_alloc_root(inode);
if (!root) {
     dbg("%s: could not get root dentry!\n",
         __FUNCTION__);
     iput(inode);
     return NULL;
}
sb-&gt;s_root = root;
return sb;
</pre><p>That is all we need to do to initialize our superblock, and
now the kernel has mounted our filesystem.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>pcihpfs_get_inode()</b></span> is
another function that we need to create for our filesystem. It is
called whenever we need to create a new inode for our filesystem.
Listing 2 shows what the pci_hotplug driver uses to do this.</p><p><a href="5633l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Creating a New
Inode</a></p><p>First we call the kernel new_inode() function in order to
create and initialize a new inode structure. If this succeeds, we
then proceed to fill up a number of the fields with the necessary
information. The i_uid and i_gid members are set to the current
process' uid and gid values, insuring that whoever has the
permission to create the inode can access it later. The i_atime,
i_mtime and i_ctime members refer to the inode's access time, last
modified time and time of last change. We set all of these
variables to the current time. If this inode is a &ldquo;regular&rdquo; file
type, then we point to our set of default_file_operations as the
set of functions that should be called whenever the inode is acted
upon (open, write, read, etc.). If this inode is a directory inode,
we point to our default set of directory inode functions. And if
the inode is neither a regular inode nor a directory inode, we then
let the kernel initialize it with a call to
init_special_inode().</p><p>So, now that the filesystem is internally mounted, how do we
create a file that a user can read and write to? To do this, we
call our fs_create_file() function, passing in the name of the file
we want to create, the mode of the file, a pointer to the parent
directory of the file (if this is NULL, we default to the root
directory of the filesystem), a pointer to a blob of data that we
want assigned to this file and a pointer to a set of file
operations that will be called when the file is accessed (see
Listing 3).</p><p><a href="5633l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Creating a File that a
User Can Read and Write to</a></p><p>Here we call pcihpfs_create_by_name to get a new dentry with
all of the specified information. After our new dentry is created,
we save off our data pointer and point the dentry file_operations
to the one we really want to have called when this dentry's inode
is accessed.</p><p>The struct file_operations that we assign to an inode differs
depending on the kind of file we created. For the &ldquo;power&rdquo; file,
which reports if the specific PCI slot is on or off and also
controls turning the slot on or off, we use the following
structure:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
static struct file_operations power_file_operations = {
        read:         power_read_file,
        write:        power_write_file,
        open:         default_open,
};
</pre><p>The interesting functions here are power_read_file and
power_write_file. This is what is called whenever the file is read
from or written to. The other functions are called when the
different operations are made on the file. When open() is called,
the kernel calls default_open; when llseek is called, the kernel
calls default_file_lseek() and so on.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>power_read_file()</b></span> is a
fairly simple function. All we want to do is return the current
power status of the specific PCI slot. The code to do this
is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
page = (unsigned char *)__get_free_page(GFP_KERNEL);
if (!page)
        return -ENOMEM;
retval = get_power_status (slot, &amp;value);
if (retval)
        goto exit;
len = sprintf (page, "%d\n", value);
</pre><p>This code allocates a chunk of memory (one page), gets the
power status of a specific PCI slot (through the call to
get_power_status()) and then writes a string representation of this
status to the chunk of memory. The chunk of memory is then copied
into user space. Remember, the original memory is located in kernel
space; if you want the user to be able to see the memory, you need
to call</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if (copy_to_user (buf, page, len)) {
       retval = -EFAULT; goto exit;
}
</pre><p>where buf is a pointer to the user-space buffer that was
originally passed to the read() call. So when a user issues the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat /tmp/pcihpfs/slot2/power
</pre><p>the result is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
1
</pre><p>The power_write_file() function is equally as simple. We want
the user to be able to control the power of a PCI slot with a
simple echo command, something like</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo 1 &gt; /tmp/pcihpfs/slot3/power
</pre><p>to turn on the power to the third PCI slot in the system. To
do this, we need to convert the string representation of the value
that is passed to us into a binary number and determine what
slot-specific function to call (see Listing 4).</p><p><a href="5633l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. Controlling the Power of
a PCI Slot</a></p><p>First we create a buffer that is one byte bigger than the
user string and fill it with zeros. Then we copy the buffer from
user space into our kernel buffer, convert it into a binary number
with the simple_strtoul() function, and then act on the value of
the binary number by either calling disable_slot() or enable_slot()
on the specified PCI slot.</p><p>With those two simple functions mentioned above, we have now
created a driver interface that can be accessed by any user,
without needing to make special ioctl-type calls.</p><p>When the driver shuts down, it needs to remove all of the
files that it had originally created in the filesystem, in order to
be allowed to unmount the filesystem and free up all of the
allocated memory. To do this, it calls the fs_remove_file()
function (see Listing 5).</p><p><a href="5633l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5. Calling the
fs_remove_file() Function</a></p><p>This function needs a pointer to the dentry that the call to
fs_create_file returned. It determines if the dentry has a valid
parent, as you need the parent of the dentry in order to be able to
remove it. Then it calls into the kernel VFS layer to remove the
dentry (different calls are made depending on whether the dentry
refers to a directory or to a file).</p><p>We have described the basic filesystem functions that are
needed to implement a filesystem in a driver. For a better
description of how all of the different pieces work together, look
at the code in the drivers/hotplug/pci_hotplug_core.c file in the
Linux kernel tree.</p><p>This article has been based on what is necessary for the 2.4
kernel. The 2.5 kernel should make things even easier, due to the
exporting of most of the ramfs functions. This will enable more
code sharing among the RAM-based filesystems, decreasing the amount
of work a driver author has to do and preventing the author from
doing things incorrectly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x133a580.0x142aee8"></a>Acknowledgements</h2></div></div><p>I would like to thank Pat Mochel for writing the
