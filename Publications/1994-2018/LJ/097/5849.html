    Reuven shows you how easy it is to turn a simple Zope site
    into one that reads and writes data in a relational
    database.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a5580.0x169d608"></a></h2></div></div><p>Just about anyone who creates a serious
web site will eventually want to connect it to a relational
database. Relational database systems might be 30-year-old
technology, but they're flexible, safe and fast. Using a database
ensures that we can store and retrieve data needed by our web
application without having to create our own persistent storage
layer. This results in fewer bugs, greater speed and far greater
safety.</p><p>Zope, the object-oriented web application server that we have
discussed over the last few months, includes a built-in object
database known as ZODB. ZODB is both powerful and easy to use;
everything in Zope, including DTML documents and folders, is stored
as an object in ZODB. The fact that ZODB supports such database
concepts as transactions means that you can use it to store serious
data, confident that no one else will be modifying information
during the execution of a long, complex query.</p><p>But in many cases, ZODB isn't a good match for the data we
want to store and retrieve. In many cases, this is because the data
already exists, and we simply want to use Zope to access it.
Perhaps we're creating a new persistent storage layer but want
people to be able to access it from outside of Zope. Perhaps our
data is more suited for the relational database model than an
object database. And finally, perhaps our organization's IT
department requires that all information be stored in a relational
database.</p><p>For all of these reasons and situations, the standard Zope
installation defines a ZSQL method object. This month, we'll take a
look at ZSQL methods and at the general integration of Zope with
relational databases. As you'll see, it's very easy to turn a
simple Zope site into one that reads and writes data in a
relational database.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a5580.0x169d818"></a>Database Connections</h2></div></div><p>Before we can work with a database, we must first connect to
it. In Zope, we accomplish this by creating a database connection
object. A Zope site can contain any number of such objects, each of
which is then available for sending SQL queries to a
database.</p><p>Zope comes with a single kind of database connection, which
allows you to work with the simple Gadfly relational database. But
while Gadfly is good for demonstrating Zope's database
connectivity, it cannot match any other relational database in
terms of speed or functionality. I suggest skipping Gadfly
completely, installing a database adapter for the server to which
you intend to connect.</p><p>I have a running PostgreSQL server on my office database
server, so I decided to install the psycopg database adapter, one
of several PostgreSQL adapters currently available on the Internet.
(See Resources for more information on psycopg.) When installing
these (and other) packages, remember that Zope typically comes with
its own copy of Python, which is independent of any other copies
that might be installed on your system. This means that you must
install psycopg into the Python library defined by Zope (using
$ZOPE/bin/python) rather than /usr/local/bin/python or
/usr/bin/python.</p><p>Before we can install psycopg, we must first install the
mxDateTime class written and distributed by eGenix. This package
makes it possible to work with dates and times beyond the current
UNIX limits (starting in 1970 and lasting until 2038) and provides
a number of convenience routines to work with dates and times in
various formats. Even if you don't use this module, you still will
need to install it in order to get psycopg to install correctly.
You can download mxDateTime from
<a href="http://www.egenix.com/files/python/eGenix-mx-Extensions.html" target="_self">www.egenix.com/files/python/eGenix-mx-Extensions.html</a>.</p><p>Note that you will want to download the &ldquo;base&rdquo; extensions
package (which is free), rather than the commercial extensions
package. Even if you are using an RPM-compatible distribution of
Linux, you should not download the RPMs for mxDateTime. This is
because we need to compile and install the libraries into our Zope
Python tree, rather than the system Python tree.</p><p>After downloading and unpacking the mxBase package, you
should be able to install it by switching into the mxBase directory
and typing</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ZOPE/bin/python setup.py install
</pre><p>This will compile and install the mx module into your Python
installation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a5580.0x169dbe0"></a>Installing psycopg</h2></div></div><p>We're almost ready to install psycopg, a combination of
Python and C that requires you to have the PostgreSQL development
libraries installed. If you install PostgreSQL using RPMs, then you
will need the postgresql-devel RPM for the appropriate version of
PostgreSQL that you are running. This should install files in
/usr/local/pgsql and /usr/include/pgsql, although some
installations use postgresql instead of pgsql in both of these
paths.</p><p>Now download the psycopg source code from
<a href="http://initd.org/pub/software/psycopg" target="_self">initd.org/pub/software/psycopg</a>.
I retrieved version 1.0.4, but new versions seem to arrive every
few weeks, so be sure to retrieve a recent version. In order to
unpack and install psycopg, you will need to make the makesetup
shell script (installed into $ZOPE/lib/python2.1/config in Zope
2.5b1, the latest version as of this writing) executable:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chmod 775 $ZOPE/lib/python2.1/config
</pre><p>To configure psycopg, change into its source directory and
enter the following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
./configure
    --with-python=$ZOPE/bin/python
    --with-zope=$ZOPE
    --with-mxdatetime-includes=$ZOPE/lib/python2.1/
      site-packages/mx/DateTime/mxDateTime
    --with-postgres-includes=/usr/include/pgsql
</pre>


You should obviously change the paths to reflect your installation,
paying particular attention to the Python version number (2.1, in
my case) and the PostgreSQL include directory.
</p><p>While I remain convinced that there is a way to avoid doing
so by passing configure another option, it seems that you must now
edit the Makefile by hand to add a new header directory to the
CFLAGS variable. Open the Makefile in your favorite editor and
modify the CFLAGS definition (line 90 in my version) to include
headers from $ZOPE/include/python2.1. Thus, if $ZOPE is
/usr/local/zope, you would add the following to CFLAGS:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
-I/usr/local/zope/include/python2.1
</pre><p>Save the Makefile, and then install psycopg with
<pre     class="programlisting">
make &amp;&amp; make install &amp;&amp; make install-zope
</pre>


This will compile and install psycopg for Python and Zope within
your $ZOPE directory.
</p><p>Finally, move the psycopg shared library (psycopgmodule.so)
from $ZOPE/lib/python2.1/site-packages to
$ZOPE/lib/python2.1/lib-dynload/.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a5580.0x169e058"></a>Configuring psycopg</h2></div></div><p>You can test psycopg by restarting Zope and adding a new
product in the root directory. (Unfortunately, restarting Zope is
the only way to tell the system that a new product has been
installed.) The product you want to install is called Z Psycopg
Database Connection in the &ldquo;add product&rdquo; menu in the upper
right-hand corner of the Zope management screen.</p><p>Each database connection object allows you to connect to a
single database on a single host, with a single user name and
password. This means that if you have divided your information
across two different databases (or two different database servers),
you will need two connection objects.</p><p>When you choose Z Psycopg Database Connection from the &ldquo;add
product&rdquo; menu, you are then asked to provide some basic details
about this database connection. You must enter an ID (which must be
unique within a folder) and a title (which will appear in the
management screen), as well as a database connection string. This
connection string tells Zope how to find and connect to a
PostgreSQL server. In my office, the atf database sits on the
PostgreSQL server on &ldquo;databases&rdquo;, and I can connect to it with
the user &ldquo;reuven&rdquo; and no password. Thus, I enter the following
connection string:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
host=databases dbname=atf user=reuven
</pre><p>You can leave the rest of the items in their default state if
you wish. Click on the Add button, and you will be returned to the
folder in which you added the new connection object.
</p><p>Clicking on the connection object displays several Zope tabs
that you can use to administer the database connection. The four
most interesting ones are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Status: this tab tells you whether the database
connection is open (i.e., whether it is connected to your
PostgreSQL server). It also allows you to close the
connection.</p></li><li><p>Properties: you can modify the properties that you
set when you initially created the database connection object. This
is particularly useful if the database is moved to a different
server or if you change the password necessary to access it.</p></li><li><p>Test: you can test the database connection by
sending any SQL query to it. Of course, the query must be valid; if
you send illegal SQL or try to address a table that does not exist,
then you will get an appropriate error from the PostgreSQL server.
For example, you can enter <b  >SELECT * FROM
pg_database;</b>. You can enter any SQL via this box, which
can be convenient for testing your database when you have no direct
Telnet or SSH connection. If you enter an INSERT or UPDATE query,
Zope will indicate that the query didn't return any results. As
always, it's a good idea to avoid using <b  >SELECT *</b>
except in trivial examples to avoid being surprised by the order or
name of columns in the result set.</p></li><li><p>Browse: you can look through the tables in a
PostgreSQL database with the browse tab, which displays a Zope
tree-style list of tables and fields.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a5580.0x169e6e0"></a>ZSQL Methods</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have a database connection, we can create one or
more ZSQL methods. Each ZSQL method is a single SQL query (with
variable arguments, if you want) that works with a
connection.</p><p>Let's create a ZSQL method that lets us add a new name into
an address book. Of course, this means that we must first have an
appropriate table defined in our database. We can create the table
by sending the content of Listing 1 to PostgreSQL, either in the
test tab for our database connection or by using the traditional
psql command-line interface.</p><p><a href="5849l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Creating a
Table</a></p><p>If you try to add a ZSQL method when no database connection
is available, Zope will display an error message, complaining that
it could not find any suitable database connection.</p><p>Zope's built-in system of &ldquo;acquisition&rdquo; means that a ZSQL
method can use any database connection above it in the Zope
hierarchy. A user thus can choose a different database connection
for each method, making it possible to integrate information from
different databases in a single application&mdash;or to migrate your web
site from one brand of database to another.</p><p>To create a ZSQL method, go to the folder in which you
created your database connection and choose &ldquo;ZSQL method&rdquo; from
the &ldquo;add product&rdquo; menu. You will be asked to enter several items:
an ID (which must uniquely identify your object in this folder), a
title (which will be visible in the management interface),
arguments (which we will discuss in the next section) and finally
the SQL itself. Your SQL query can be as simple or as complex as
you like and can perform an INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE.</p><p>Once you have added your ZSQL method to the system, clicking
on it brings up a number of Zope tabs. One of these tabs is labeled
test, and (as you might expect) it allows you to test the query. If
your query has arguments, then you are asked to enter them in an
HTML form. If not, you are simply asked to click on the Submit
Query button. This returns, as with the test tab from our database
connection object, an HTML table describing the results of our
query&mdash;or a message indicating that our query returned no
results.</p><p>We can create a ZSQL method for each query we wish to
perform. While this might seem a bit odd, it's actually a very
flexible and elegant solution that I've grown to appreciate more
and more. If I expect to perform 20 queries in a web application, I
can put each of them in a separate ZSQL method and then invoke
those methods from within DTML pages.</p><p>Within a DTML page, we can retrieve results from a ZSQL
method by naming it in a &lt;dtml-in&gt; tag. For example, I create
a ZSQL method that implements the following query:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    SELECT first_name, last_name, phone_number,
           fax_number, cell_number
      FROM AddressBook
  ORDER BY last_name, first_name
</pre><p>If I give this ZSQL the name &ldquo;names-and-phone-numbers&rdquo;,
then I can invoke it from within a DTML document with the code in
Listing 2. In just a few lines of DTML, we have successfully
managed to produce a simple (but useful and flexible) ZSQL method.
But how does it work?
</p><p><a href="5849l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Invoking ZSQL from within
a DTML Document</a></p><p>When Zope receives a request for this DTML document, it
parses the DTML and executes each of the tags contained within. The
&lt;dtml-in&gt; loop construct expects a sequence as an argument;
in this particular case, the sequence is the result from invoking
the names-and-phone-numbers method. The &lt;dtml-in&gt; tag also
assigns one variable for each column in the returned result set.
This is how we can use the &lt;dtml-var first_name&gt; tag to print
the user's first name; Zope automatically assigns the value of the
first_name column to a variable called first_name.</p><p>In order to avoid printing unnecessary and blank lines, we
use &lt;dtml-if&gt; to check that we did not receive a NULL or
empty value back from PostgreSQL.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a5580.0x1a96f60"></a>ZSQL Arguments</h2></div></div><p>It's obvious how we can use ZSQL methods and DTML to perform
the same query each time. But if we want to modify our basic query
each time it is run, we will need to define one or more
arguments.</p><p>For example, if we want to retrieve information about someone
based on their last name (or a portion thereof, using SQL regular
expressions), we will want to define the following sort of ZSQL
method:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    SELECT first_name, last_name, phone_number,
           fax_number, cell_number
      FROM AddressBook
     WHERE last_name LIKE
  ORDER BY last_name, first_name
</pre><p>In DTML, we can replace the <span   class="emphasis"><em>XXXXXX</em></span> with
the &lt;dtml-sqlvar&gt; tag, which automatically handles quoting
for us. We must name the SQL variable that we are using, as well as
indicate its type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
    SELECT first_name, last_name, phone_number,
           fax_number, cell_number
      FROM AddressBook
     WHERE last_name LIKE &lt;dtml-sqlvar name_sqlregexp
                           type="string"&gt;
  ORDER BY last_name, first_name
</pre>


In order for the above ZSQL method to work, we must name an
argument (name_sqlregexp) in the appropriate text box when creating
our method. Zope will take the value of that variable, place it
inside of our query and retrieve the results.
</p><p>We can put even more of the burden on Zope if we use a
&lt;dtml-sqltest&gt; tag, which operates similarly to
&lt;dtml-sqlvar&gt;:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    SELECT first_name, last_name, phone_number,
           fax_number, cell_number
      FROM AddressBook
     WHERE &lt;dtml-sqltest name_sqlregexp op="like"
            type="string"&gt;
  ORDER BY last_name, first_name
</pre><p>If we have stored the above query in a ZSQL method named
select_by_last_name, then Zope can automatically produce skeleton
DTML documents that allow users to enter search terms and see
results. To do this, simply choose the &ldquo;Z Search Interface&rdquo;
product from the &ldquo;add product&rdquo; list. You will be able to choose
from all of the searchable objects on the system, including the
ZSQL method that we just created (select_by_last_name). Choose
this, and give the report an ID (I used search_by_last_name). Also
give a name to the &ldquo;input ID&rdquo;, which is a fancy term for the HTML
form that will be used to send input to search_by_last_name. (I
named it search_by_last_name_form.) In modern versions of Zope, you
also must indicate whether you want the system to create DTML
methods or page templates; we want the former.
</p><p>Clicking on Add creates two new DTML methods in the current
folder, corresponding to the names that you entered in the form.
Clicking on the &ldquo;input ID&rdquo; URL will present a simple HTML form
into which you can enter an SQL regular expression. Clicking on the
submit button will send your query to the search_by_last_name DTML
method, which will in turn invoke our ZSQL method
(select_by_last_name), which will then pass along our query to
PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL returns results to select_by_last_name,
which returns a result set to search_by_last_name, which then
displays them in our web browser.</p><p>You can, of course, modify the DTML methods that are created
to match the style of your own site. You also can copy the DTML
that Zope created automatically into your own DTML pages, using
them as examples of how to create your own database queries.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a5580.0x1a973d8"></a>Inserting</h2></div></div><p>The only major task left is the implementation of an INPUT
query, which adds items into the database. Luckily, this is rather
easy: we create a ZSQL method that inserts a row into the database.
Then we create a DTML document that submits its HTML form elements
to another DTML document. This second document invokes
&lt;dtml-call&gt; to our ZSQL method.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Voil&agrave;</em></span>--our record is inserted into the
database.</p><p>Listing 3 shows the ZSQL method that we need, which I named
insert_address_data. Now we'll create a simple DTML document, which
will contain an HTML form (see Listing 4).</p><p><a href="5849l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. The ZSQL Method
insert_address_data</a></p><p><a href="5849l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. DTML Document Containing
HTML Form</a></p><p>Finally, we create the DTML document insert_address that
receives input from insert_address_form and passes its arguments
along to the ZSQL method insert_address_data:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;dtml-var standard_html_header&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;dtml-var title_or_id&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;dtml-try&gt;
    &lt;dtml-call insert_address_data&gt;
&lt;dtml-except&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sorry, but the INSERT didn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dtml-else&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Successfully inserted!
&lt;/dtml-try&gt;
&lt;dtml-var standard_html_footer&gt;
</pre><p>Users can now insert information into our PostgreSQL table
using an HTML form pointed at insert_address_form, and they can
retrieve it using search_by_last_name_form. It's rather impressive
that we can do so much in so few files&mdash;and even more so that we
didn't have to touch a text editor once in order to get this to
work, but that it could all be done using nothing more than our web
browser.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a5580.0x1a977f8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>While they are not perfect, I find ZSQL methods to be an
elegant way to connect a page of HTML with an underlying database.
ZSQL is yet another way in which Zope demonstrates its very
flexible, elegant approach to web development&mdash;albeit one that
makes you scratch your head several times before it all becomes
clear and obvious. Someone who already knows DTML and SQL can
easily integrate a database into their Zope application&mdash;and with
ZSQL methods, it's possible to divide work on a site between those
who know SQL (and work on the ZSQL methods) and those who want to
work on the DTML methods that invoke them.</p><p><a href="5849s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
