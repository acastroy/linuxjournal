Wild Netfilter&rdquo; in the September 2001 issue of
<i  >LJ</i>
[<a href="../089/4815.html" target="_self">/article/4815</a>],
I received a number of e-mails, most asking for more detailed
information on working with Netfilter. To satisfy those requests,
this time I will delve a little deeper. For those of you who
haven't read and tried out a basic setup, I suggest you do so. This
article is slightly more advanced and intended for those who have a
grasp, tenuous as it may be, on the basics as described in the
aforementioned article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f21580.0x20197c0"></a>Preparing Your System for an iptables
Upgrade</h2></div></div><p>In order to get the most out of Netfilter and the user-land
component iptables, you'll need to upgrade both your kernel and
iptables. While there's nothing wrong with the kernel and iptables
that came with your distribution, the Netfilter code is under
constant development. You also certainly might have no idea what
patches your distribution saw fit to include in the iptables area
(probably none). And, not all patches show up as Netfilter modules
or iptables match extensions. I do, however, recommend you don't
try what's in this article for the first time on your currently
running firewall. Make sure you know what to expect by
experimenting on a test system.</p><p>The final recommendation in the paragraph above brings up a
very important point. This article is based on iptables-1.2.4 and
the Linux kernel 2.4.17. Your results will almost certainly vary if
you use different versions. The principles will be the same. Don't
panic; just try to make some intelligent decisions about what you
want. Also understand that just as oil and water don't normally
mix, some of the choices you make regarding the modules you want
will affect other modules in the same way&mdash;that is, some modules
don't mix well with others. Looking at the 2.4.18-prepatches, some
of the iptables patches applied for this article will be
incorporated in 2.4.18. I suggest a look at the 2.4.18 Changelog
when this kernel version is finally released to see what you now
won't need to try to patch (the patch would fail anyway, detected
or not&mdash;see below).</p><p>In this article, we'll be using Rusty Russell's patch-o-matic
that will patch both the iptables and kernel sources. This
patch-o-matic (POM) isn't completely automatic and will not attempt
to patch anything without your approval. It also will test the
patch to be applied first to see if it applies correctly. If it
doesn't, you will be told and given several options. If a patch
doesn't succeed, your best and safest bet is to continue without
applying it. But we'll see that as we go along.</p><p>First, download the latest kernel version you want to use
(available from
<a href="http://www.kernel.org" target="_self">www.kernel.org</a>). It can
be 2.4.16 or higher. I always recommend waiting at least a week
after the latest stable version is out before trying it. That way,
if some small bug has made its way into the latest kernel (2.4.15's
shutdown filesystem corruption bug comes to mind), you'll probably
know about it and avoid a potentially nasty situation.</p><p>Using whatever method appeals to you, open and configure your
new kernel. This article won't cover kernel building, but a number
of articles and sites can bring you up to speed on this (the
definitive guide is found in your kernel source tree under
Documentation/Changes). I suggest you configure as modules all the
Netfilter code. For now, you'll need to choose at least:</p><p>1. Code maturity level options--&gt;Prompt for development
and/or incomplete code/drivers</p><p>and</p><p>2. Networking options--&gt;Network packet filtering (replaces
ipchains)</p><p>and from here also go ahead and enter</p><p>--&gt;TCP/IP Networking--&gt;IP: Netfilter Configuration
(click to go to subpage)</p><p>3. On the IP: Netfilter Configuration subpage configure all
modules.</p><p>If you want, select the IPv6 protocol, and you can then also
configure the IPv6 Netfilter modules. You'll need to proceed at
least as far as the &ldquo;make dep&rdquo; step with this kernel to get
everything prepared.</p><p>By the way, if you read near the bottom of the Help that
comes with the Network packet-filtering choice, you'll find you
should choose Y if your system will act as a router; otherwise
select N, and if unsure, select no. I don't know how sage this
advice is. Even simple hosts often need the extra protection that
can be afforded by Netfilter. You'll have to decide that question
for yourself based on your best risk assessment for your network
and how the host will be used. We'll see how Netfilter is, in fact,
used on machines other than routers, below.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f21580.0x2019d40"></a>Digging into iptables</h2></div></div><p>Once you have your kernel ready, download and open the latest
iptables (available from
<a href="http://netfilter.samba.org" target="_self">netfilter.samba.org</a>).
Change into the iptables directory, and you're almost ready to
start. If your kernel is not located in /usr/src/linux, then you'll
need to tell iptables where to find it. Additionally, if you don't
want to install iptables in /usr/local/, you'll need to specify
where you want to install it. There's a reason for each of these
parameters (listed below) to be included. Since iptables will be
patching the kernel, it must know where to find the kernel, and the
iptables binary must know where to find the extensions. The
location of the extensions is hard-coded into the binary, so you
can't arbitrarily move things around later&mdash;you'll have to rebuild
and re-install.</p><p>The following arguments are available for iptables
builds:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>KERNEL_DIR=/path/to/kernel/source (default:
/usr/src/linux)</p></li><li><p>BINDIR=/path/to/install/binaries (default:
/usr/local/bin)</p></li><li><p>LIBDIR=/path/to/install/lib-extensions (default:
/usr/local/lib)</p></li><li><p>MANDIR=/path/to/install/manpages (default:
/usr/local/man)</p></li></ul></div><p>At this point, I must note that I often work in a chroot
environment, particularly when beating on the kernel sources, etc.,
so I don't inadvertently damage a working system. However, I've
found that the patch-o-matic doesn't work properly chroot-ed.
Normally, patch-o-matic will create a temporary directory just
above the kernel source tree where it patches and tests, then
replaces the kernel sources from there. In a chroot environment (at
least on my systems), this directory is never created, and the
directory above the kernel source tree becomes a mess as it fills
with the kernel source. I've been remiss and not taken the time to
look at the problem sufficiently to identify the root cause. But
it's not important if you just back up your kernel source before
continuing.</p><p>The first command you'll want to use (assuming the kernel
source directory is located in your $HOME directory) is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make pending-patches KERNEL_DIR=$HOME/linux
</pre><p>You should have no problems with this target. It will tell
you what patches it wants to install. You should say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to all
these. If, for some reason, any patch doesn't apply (the program
may tell you the patch failed to apply), don't worry. The patch
already may be incorporated in the kernel source, but the patch
logic was unable to detect it. Just tell the script &ldquo;no&rdquo; the
second time around. Do <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> force the patch on.
Although this is an option, it normally will result in the script
aborting. Once pending-patches completes, it will tell you the
kernel is ready for compilation. But we're not quite ready yet.
</p><p>Patches applied or attempted on my system were ipt_LOG.patch
(successful) and tos-fix.patch (failed). The tos-fix.patch failed
because a fix was applied, but it did not correspond exactly to the
patch in the patch-o-matic.</p><p>Once you have applied all pending patches to the kernel
source, you're ready to take a look at new patches that have not
been incorporated into the kernel.</p><p>Some time back, Rusty Russell, lead Netfilter developer,
introduced the &ldquo;make patch-o-matic target&rdquo; to help folks
incorporate new things in the kernel without having to know how to
use <span   class="bold"><b>patch</b></span>. This target works
fairly well, but don't expect it to work perfectly. Sometimes the
patch logic is sufficiently old, and the kernel source sufficiently
changed, that a particular patch won't work. In recent months, the
patch-o-matic has grown quite a bit and some patches break others.
So Rusty incorporated yet another target, &ldquo;most-of-pom&rdquo;, to allow
new iptables builders to get access to as many of the patches as
possible but reduce the possibility of failure.</p><p>My recommendation to you is to run <b  >make
most-of-pom</b>, first saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to everything but noting
those patches you're interested in. Then run <b  >make
patch-o-matic</b>, noting any new patches not in most-of-pom
that you might be interested in. If no new patches interest you in
patch-o-matic, stick to most-of-pom. If any new patches do interest
you that are only available in patch-o-matic, take careful note of
any other patches those new, interesting patches might break. The
worst offender as of this writing seems to be the drop-table patch.
We'll not look at that patch for this very reason. But if you need
it, just read and heed the warnings with that patch and others that
tell you they will be broken by it.</p><p>In some cases, such as with the H323-conntrack-nat patch, you
will not be able to apply a patch to the kernels we use in this
article. If you can't do without this particular patch, you
probably won't be able to use the experimental make targets for
patching (patch-o-matic or most-of-pom). If this is you (I had this
need for one customer's system), you need to go to
<a href="http://roeder.goe.net/~koepi" target="_self">roeder.goe.net/~koepi</a>.
The patch there includes newnat5, h323, talk, ftp and irc nat
helpers. This is a standard patch applied using the usual patch
utility.</p><p>While running <b  >make KERNEL_DIR=$HOME/linux
patch-o-matic</b>, I selected the following patches:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
NETLINK.patch (successful)
NETMAP.patch (successful)
iplimit.patch (successful)
mport.patch (successful)
pkttype.patch (successful)
psd.patch (successful)
realm.patch (successful)
snmp-nat.patch (failed: already in kernel)
string.patch (successful)
tos-fix.patch (failed: already in kernel)
ulog.patch (failed: incompatible with kernel
            or previously applied patch)
LOG.patch.ipv6 (failed: already in kernel)
REJECT.patch.ipv6 (successful)
</pre><p>While going through pending-patches and the patch-o-matic,
you'll want to note a few things. The screen is divided by a line.
Above the line is a welcome note and a warning. Below the line is
the information you should look at.
</p><p>First, you will have one or more lines that will tell you
which patches already have been applied. You'll note as you go
through patch-o-matic that it lists the patches applied in
pending-patches. In fact, because we're running patch-o-matic, we
don't need to run pending-patches; those patches also would have
been applied here. You only need to run pending-patches if you
don't also run most-of-pom or patch-o-matic, such as if you decided
to use the newnat5/h323 patch mentioned above.</p><p>Below the already-applied lines comes a line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Testing... <span   class="emphasis"><em>Patchname.patch STATUS</em></span> (<span   class="emphasis"><em>comment</em></span>)
</pre><p>The patchname.patch is the patch being tested. The STATUS
will normally be NOT APPLIED. The comment will be one of (x missing
files) or (x reject of y hunks). Missing files means the patch
hasn't been applied (or the particular corresponding files wouldn't
be missing), or the patch doesn't match what's in the kernel
sources. In general, the reject means a patch has been applied, it
just doesn't match the patch in the patch-o-matic for whatever
reason. The most common reason is a small fix was made between the
patch in patch-o-matic and the patch in the kernel. When you see
reject, it is a foregone conclusion that patch won't apply. Not all
patches will work. Note that the ulog.patch failed. This failed
either because it was incompatible with a previous patch or with
the (changed) kernel sources since the patch was originally
created.
</p><p>Third comes information about the patch, author, status of
patch, what the patch is, what it does, often an example to clarify
how to use it and perhaps a comment.</p><p>Finally, the question, do you want to apply this patch? The
choices are No (default), yes, test, force, quit and help as
indicated by [N/y/t/f/q/?].</p><p>Once we've added the patches we want, we're done. Now the
kernel is ready for compilation. Or is it? Well, yes. However,
we've added targets to the kernel. I suggest you return to the
kernel tree, run <b  >make oldconfig</b> and select the
new Netfilter matches and targets we've incorporated (or what was
the sense?). Now you can continue to compile the kernel. After you
install the kernel and reboot into it, you're ready to put your new
matches and targets to work.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f21580.0x201abb0"></a>Compiling and Installing iptables</h2></div></div><p>While the kernel source is compiling, there's plenty of time
to compile and install iptables. Remember to supply the KERNEL_DIR=
(if it's not in /usr/src/linux) and the BINDIR=, LIBDIR= and
MANDIR= arguments if you don't want your new binaries and
extensions installed in /usr/local/.</p><p>One small fix before we start compiling. For whatever reason,
the NETLINK extension does not compile. So if you chose the
NETLINK.patch (as I did) you need to make a minor adjustment. Just
<b  >cd</b> into the extensions directory and open the
Makefile using your favorite text editor. The first line is our
shebang line. The second line is blank. The third line starts off
PF_EXT_SLIB: and contains various extensions to be made and
installed. Add <b  >NETLINK</b> to the end of the line
and save the file back.</p><p>Now <b  >cd</b> back up to the root of the iptables
source tree and run your <b  >make</b> and <b  >make
install</b>, adding the arguments noted above if
required.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f21580.0x2413170"></a>Some Installation Closing Notes</h2></div></div><p>Above, we used a modified patch process to patch the kernel.
If you, like me, grab kernel patches whenever they come out, you'll
find that some will no longer apply cleanly because the kernel
sources have been modified. So when I do want to try out a new
kernel, I save the old .config file, wipe out the old kernel
sources and start fresh. You can do that or remember to save a
tarball of your kernel source tree before modifying it.</p><p>If you built a modular kernel previously using patch-o-matic
(or pending-patches or most-of-pom) and are only adding a few more
modules, after you use <b  >make oldconfig</b> to add the
new modules, you can do a <b  >make modules; make
modules_install</b> and start using those modules.</p><p>If you want to see the information again that you saw while
adding the patch-o-matic patches, it's available in the
iptables-x.x.x/patch-o-matic/ directory. The files *.patch.help
contain the information. In most cases, the examples in these files
are duplicated in the kernel configuration help.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f21580.0x24133d8"></a>The Wall&mdash;One Brick at a Time</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have the modules we want compiled and installed,
we're ready to put them to work. But before we start, we need to
decide exactly what we're going to do. In order to do that we need
to lay some groundwork. This groundwork isn't so important when all
we have is our home system and we want to let everyone inside out
but keep everyone outside out as well. Our state table alone
practically assures us that's what we'll have; add masquerading or
SNAT and we're done. This is what we had using the basic scripts
from the &ldquo;Taming the Wild Netfilter&rdquo; article (September 2001
<i  >LJ</i>).</p><p>But firewalls in use at companies are rarely so simple. They
demand that we first understand (and maybe even restructure) our
network topology. We also need to understand exactly what it is we
want our firewall to accomplish. Sometimes, this is not much more
than for our home system, but often it is radically different. We
can use the company's network security policy to assist us (we do
<span   class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> an NSP, don't we?), plus some knowledge
of what we want from our network access. We won't discuss risk
assessments here [see Mick Bauer's &ldquo;Practical Threat Analysis and
Risk Management&rdquo; in the January 2002 issue of
<i  >LJ</i>], but their findings should be kept in mind
to help guide us in the overall scheme.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f21580.0x2413640"></a>Topology, Shmopology&mdash;Where Do I Plug in My
Laptop?</h2></div></div><p>Many years ago we talked about our internet-connected hosts.
They were all directly connected to the Internet. No big deal, as
all the system administrators knew each other and things were
friendly. Then everyone else discovered the Internet, and we had to
make some changes. As things mushroomed out of control, we forgot
or never knew who our neighbor system administrators were. We found
our systems under attack. So we left our public systems directly
connected but started hiding our users' hosts behind packet filters
to help protect them. The systems between our router and packet
filter were said to be on our DMZ, or demilitarized zone. The rest
were on our trusted network behind the packet filter.</p><p>Today, few companies would configure their systems this way.
In our current situation, usually only honeypots are deliberately
left defenseless. Today, the two most common configurations either
have a firewall with two internal NICs (one for the trusted network
and one for the internal, public access network) or two separate
firewalls (the first allowing public traffic into a controlled, but
not trusted network and a second permitting entry into our inner
sanctum or trusted network).</p><p>While small companies may mix the trusted and controlled
networks on one private internal network, it is best to keep these
separated whenever possible. You also should control who has access
to which area. Firewalls do a lot to keep bad guys out, but do
little to protect against bad guys already inside. In fact, you may
find it's prudent to put a firewall up between accounting and
marketing and engineering and production. None has much business in
any of the other's files.</p><p>Because this article is principally about iptables, I'll not
cover more on network topology. But we needed to understand the
above to see how the configurations below work. They really aren't
too much different from the point of view of the external firewall,
only the internal one(s), if needed, will look a bit more like the
basic firewall I presented in the first article. That is, the
internal firewalls won't accept new traffic except from the trusted
side. What goes out also can be moderated to an extent, and we'll
look at that a little bit also.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f21580.0x2413850"></a>Running iptables on Nonfirewall Systems</h2></div></div><p>There are times we might want to run iptables on a
nonfirewall system. Despite the advice you may have read (as noted
in the last paragraph of the &ldquo;Preparing Your System for an
iptables Upgrade&rdquo; section above), there are times you'll want to
run iptables on simple hosts. The simplest, but most common example
would be a student system on a university network. In this case,
you really should trust no other system. So you'll probably want to
accept only related, established traffic.</p><p>Another example might be if you have decided to use an XDM
server where most users work, but your internet policy only permits
certain employees rights to surf the Web. How to deal with this?
Well, fortunately, we can deal with this fairly simply with rules
like the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -t filter -I OUTPUT -p tcp
--dport 80 -m owner --uid-owner 500 -j REJECT
iptables -t filter -I OUTPUT -p tcp
--dport 80 -j ACCEPT // only required if OUTPUT
                     // policy is DROP/REJECT
</pre><p>or:
<pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -t filter -I OUTPUT -p tcp
--dport 80 -m owner --uid-owner 500 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t filter -I OUTPUT -p tcp
--dport 80 -j REJECT // only required if OUTPUT
                     // policy is ACCEPT
</pre>


Naturally, you'd need a list of either those permitted access or
those denied. Also, you wouldn't want to write individual rules. I
suggest handling the rules like this: for i in <b  >cat
surfweb.txt</b>, do
<pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -t filter -I OUTPUT -p tcp
--dport 80 -m owner --uid-owner $i -j REJECT
done
</pre>


Just create a list of users to REJECT (or to ACCEPT and change the
rule to match) as the file surfweb.txt. Add user IDs to this list
as needed. You might find the above construct valuable for other
repetitive rules as well. Note, however, this only prevents them
from surfing from the XDM server, not from their local system.
</p><p>So how might they be stopped from surfing from their local
system? Well, the firewall simply could drop or reject packets
coming from the disallowed IP. Easy, right? I mean, this is what
packet filters are all about. But wait, we're using DHCP and don't
necessarily know in advance what the IP will be. Looks like we've
outsmarted ourselves&mdash;or have we? While we may not know the IP
address, one thing we can know is the MAC address. So we get a list
of MAC addresses from the systems (or via arp, or from the
dhcpd.leases file). Then we use a rule like the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -t filter -I FORWARD -i eth0 -m mac
--mac-source &lt;MAC&gt; -j ACCEPT
iptables -t filter -A FORWARD -i eth0 -p tcp
--dport 80 -m state --state NEW -j DROP
</pre><p>This is best done in a loop like we did earlier, with the MAC
addresses in one file and then looping through them.
</p><p>Note: to use the MAC address to permit or deny systems,
remember that they must be on your local network&mdash;that is, directly
connected, via a hub, to the firewall. If the systems in question
are behind an internal firewall, and not connected on the same LAN
segment as the external firewall, you must put this rule on the
inner firewall.</p><p>My point here is crucial: you must know what the system with
the rule on it can know about packets it is to control. Only a
system where packets originate can know which user ID belongs to
the process originating the packets. Only a system on the local LAN
segment can know the MAC address of an originating system. After
that, we have only the information available in the IP
header.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f21580.0x2413d20"></a>Summary and a Look Ahead</h2></div></div><p>This month we looked at Rusty's patch-o-matic, installing an
updated kernel and the user-land iptables utility. Probably the
most important part is making sure that if things go wrong you can
recover. Meanwhile, Rusty has worked very hard on ensuring you
don't need to recover. After that we looked at a couple of common
network configurations. You'll need to remember these when you dive
into next month's Kernel Korner, which will be a part two of this
article. Finally, we took a quick look at how and where iptables
might be used in nonfirewall situations to control network
resources.</p><p>Next month we'll look at managing services behind our NAT-ed
firewall, specifically how to make the most use of the IPs your ISP
has assigned, and how, with this configuration, to handle services
like e-mail properly. We'll also look at more matches, targets,
tables and some common errors when building rules.</p></div></div>
