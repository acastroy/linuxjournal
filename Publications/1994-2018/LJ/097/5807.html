    Marcel shows you different ways of looking at the Linux

ami</em></span>, are you still listening to that Vorbis broadcast of
the Linux kernel on Free Radio Linux? While I admire your
determination to get to know the Linux kernel intimately for this
month's issue, the entire transmission will take months. There are
more interesting ways to get close to your kernel, Fran&ccedil;ois,
and you will not look so lost, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>.
Besides, our guests will be here soon and we must be ready.</p><p>Ah, <span   class="emphasis"><em>bonjour</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>! It is so good to see you. Welcome to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, home of fine Linux fare, great
wine, good food and excellent company&mdash;your company, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>. Please, sit and make yourselves comfortable. My
faithful waiter, Fran&ccedil;ois, will run to the cellar and bring
back the wine. We have some 1999 Cornas Champelrose that will be an
excellent wine for today's menu.</p><p>And speaking of the menu, I would like you to think of
tonight's menu as a kind of buffet or smorgasbord of little finger
foods, small but very useful applications with which you can pepper
your desktop. Ah, Fran&ccedil;ois, you are back. Wonderful. Please,
pour for our guests.</p><p>Before you arrived, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, I was
telling Fran&ccedil;ois that getting to the heart of the Linux
kernel is sometimes best done by looking at it from the outside.
After all, your kernel is the heart and soul of your Linux system,
not to mention the engine that drives all other applications. One
way to appreciate what your system is doing is through the use of
system monitors. Now, as you already know, there are literally
hundreds of such programs, so where do we start? In my Linux
kitchen, I run different desktops from time to time, most notably
Window Maker and KDE. I am particularly fond of KDE's power and
beauty, but Window Maker has a special place in my heart as well,
specifically its elegant dock applications. These small programs in
64 &times; 64 pixel squares come in every variety, including a host
of system and resource monitors.</p><p>For instance, check out Vito Caputo's WMSysMon (originally
created by Dave Clark) at
<a href="http://www.gnugeneration.com/software/wmsysmon" target="_self">www.gnugeneration.com/software/wmsysmon</a>.
This little monitor provides visual feedback on memory use, swap
use and percentage of I/O, as well as interrupts and pages being
swapped in and out. It's a lot to pack into this small monitor, but
seeing it in action (Figure 1) will give you an idea of what to
expect.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5807f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. WMSysMon tells all!
</p></div></div><p>Building this little application takes nothing more than
extracting the source, moving into the application directory
(wmsysmon-0.7.6/src) and executing a <b  >make</b>
followed by a <b  >make install</b>.</p><p>To fire up this little monitor, simply run the command
<b  >wmsysmon</b>. You have the option of running the
interrupts display as a meter or with nice LED-style blinking
lights. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mes amis</em></span>, I must tell you that what
originally excited me about computers all those years ago was the
important-looking display of blinking lights. Consequently, I run
WMSysMon with the -l option.</p><p>You must admit, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, that although
WMSysMon looks very professional, when we cook with Linux, we
occasionally lean toward lighter fare, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? If
WMSysMon is too serious a monitor for you, consider
BubbleMon-dockapp available at timecop's web site,
<a href="http://www.ne.jp/asahi/linux/timecop" target="_self">www.ne.jp/asahi/linux/timecop</a>.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Mes amis</em></span>, I am going to pretend that you
will find this program useful and immediately tell you how to build
it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf bubblemon-dockapp-1.4.tar.gz
cd bubblemon-dockapp-1.4
make
make install
</pre><p>To run the program, type <b  >bubblemon</b>.
Several people have worked on various incarnations of a bubbling
resource monitor applet, but the real genius here is the inclusion
of a cute little yellow duck swimming across the top of a bubbling
pond. The more your system is doing, the more bubbles rise to the
surface. As you start to run out of memory, the water level will
rise until your duck disappears from sight.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5807f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. No, the duck tells all.
</p></div></div>


</p><p>Move your mouse over the BubbleMon-dockapp, and your duck and
pond will slowly fade to be replaced by a CPU usage graph complete
with run average stats for the last 5, 10 and 15 minutes. Here's
another tip. If you right click on the monitor while your duck is
fading, you can capture an image in transition. In other words, you
can see a ghostly image of your duck swimming across your CPU
graph. It is possible to disable the swimming duck with the -d
option, but why would you want to do such a thing? Ah,
levity.</p><p>Of course, your kernel is busy doing other things as well,
dealing with users, running processes, dealing with e-mail, web
server requests and other internet connections. WMiNet is a Window
Maker application created by Dave Clark, Antoine Nulle and Martijn
Pieterse. Its purpose is to monitor (among other things) various
network connections, processes and users. WMiNet is available at
<a href="http://www.neotokyo.org/illusion" target="_self">www.neotokyo.org/illusion</a>.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5807f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. WMiNet, keeping an eye on things.
</p></div></div><p>After you have extracted the source using <b  >tar -xzvf
wminet-2.0.3.tar.gz</b>, change to the wminet.app/wminet
directory and do a <b  >make</b> followed by a
<b  >make install</b>. The install will create a
configuration file in /etc/wminetrc, where you can define what
specific system processes the monitor watches. What I find
particularly interesting with this one is that each of the five
display lines can be configured for a single-click command. For
instance, in position 1, I have a listing of active processes. If I
click that line, it automatically launches
<span   class="bold"><b>top</b></span>. Here's a sample from my own
/etc/wminetrc file. I think you will find it is basically
self-explanatory:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
action1=rxvt -bg black -fg white -e top
action2=rxvt -bg black -fg white -e sh -c "w; read"
action3=rxvt -bg black -fg white -e sh
-c "netstat -etpn; read"
action4=rxvt -bg black -fg white -e tail
-f /usr/local/apache/var/logs/access_log
action5=rxvt -bg black -fg white -e sh -c "df -k;read"
</pre><p>When I have looked at these little Window Maker dock
applications in the past, I have mentioned that you can run them on
other desktops as well. When running them on something like KDE,
however, there is the downside of all those processes open in the
taskbar and the frameless nature of the applications themselves.
They work just fine, but they lack the elegance of Window Maker's
dock that swallows the applications, thus making for a clean
collection of windows into your system's soul.
</p><p>Thanks to Henning Burchart and the Kappdock, KDE users need
no longer feel left out. This little tool sits quietly in the
corner, waiting for you to attach and swallow all those Window
Maker applications. Kappdock also places a little icon in KDE's
icon tray. One click banishes all the running applications from
your sight. One more click and they are back. I will show you how
to work with it momentarily, but for now start by visiting
Henning's web site at
<a href="http://www.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de/~bigboss/kappdock" target="_self">www.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de/~bigboss/kappdock</a>.</p><p>Extract and build the source using the familiar extract,
configure and make method:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf kappdock-0.44.tar.gz
cd kappdock-0.44
./configure
make
make install
</pre><p>Start Kappdock in the background by running it from the shell
or launch it by pressing Alt-F2. You should see an innocuous little
square on your screen with a small striped bar across the top and a
black arrow to the right of that bar. (Notice as well the new icon
in your KDE icon tray.) The bar actually is called the drag bar
(because you can use it to drag your applications to any position
on the desktop). I prefer to think of it as the dock itself.
Clicking on the black arrow will cause kappdock to disappear from
your desktop. Clicking on the tray icon will bring it back. So how
do you attach applications? Please allow Fran&ccedil;ois to refill
your glasses and I shall demonstrate.
</p><p>Begin by right clicking on the single square you see attached
to the dock. You can either select to edit the existing square or
add a new one. If you right click the drag bar, you will get the
option of either adding a new app or changing Kappdock's
preferences. Some of these options include the position of the dock
and the orientation of docked applications. To add an application,
click New. You'll see a dialog box similar to the one in Figure
4.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5807f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Adding an Application to Kappdock
</p></div></div><p>If you have an application already running (from the previous
examples), you simply can click on the Select button. Your mouse
pointer will change to a set of crosshairs. Move the crosshairs
over to your running application, click and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>voil&agrave;!</em></span>, your application is docked.
Optionally, you simply can type in the information yourself. Have a
look at Figure 5 for a well-stocked Kappdock.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5807f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>There you have it, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. The clock
(in this case, wmCalClock), she is telling us that closing time
approaches once again. It is time to finish your wine and perhaps
try out one last program. If you just can't seem to get your fill
of dock applications, head on over to Ben Sinclair's Dock App
Warehouse at
<a href="http://www.bensinclair.com/dockapp" target="_self">www.bensinclair.com/dockapp</a>.</p><p>This is a well-thought-out web site with tons of Window Maker
dock applications. The graphical list of applications means that
while you cannot judge an application by its graphic, you certainly
can let your imagination go wild. There should be more than enough
here to satisfy your appetite for quite some time.</p><p>On my own desktop, I run weather applications, clocks,
graphical do-nothings, power monitors, moon, sun and space weather
monitors&mdash;all these in addition to classic system resource
monitors. The design of these little programs means they take up
very little of your precious desktop space. Thank you once again,
