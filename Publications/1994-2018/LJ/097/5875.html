in your March 2002 issue. I am appreciative that Larry is
dispelling the confusion about how the GNU GPL works. He is quite
correct that to have obligations under the terms of the GNU GPL,
one must actually create and/or distribute a derivate work of some
copyrighted software licensed under the GNU GPL.</p><p>However, while dispelling FUD in that area, Larry (perhaps
unintentionally) helped to spread similar FUD himself. In his
article, Larry propagated the idea that the &ldquo;GPL is an
infection&rdquo;. Infections are (according to &ldquo;dict&rdquo; on my Debian
GNU/Linux system) things &ldquo;which taint or corrupt morally&rdquo; or
&ldquo;cause...disease&rdquo;.</p><p>This sort of fear mongering about the GNU GPL became all too
common during summer 2001, when various high-ranking executives of
Microsoft called the GNU GPL an un-American cancerous virus that
ate up software like a Pac-Man. I doubt that Larry or your magazine
want to affiliate themselves with that concerted campaign of
FUD.</p><p>As a strong advocate of software freedom, I often tell
people: &ldquo;The GNU GPL is not a virus; by contrast, it vaccinates
you from harm.&rdquo; The GNU GPL is designed to share freedom with all
who benefit from the software. No one is required to &ldquo;join the
club&rdquo;, but when you do choose to create derivative works of GNU
GPLed software, you have obligations to the community. The GNU GPL
is designed to create a software commons, with provisions that help
avoid the tragedy of the commons.</p><p>I urge your editorial staff and Larry himself to avoid using
biased terms like &ldquo;infection&rdquo; when trying to give &ldquo;Unbiased
License&rdquo; information. The unbiased way to describe the GNU GPL's
nature in this regard is simple: &ldquo;The GNU GPL requires that those
who distribute derivate works license the source of the derivate
work in a GPL-compatible way.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;Bradley M. KuhnVice President, Free Software
Foundation</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry replies:</b></span> Bradley,
thanks for your letter. I usually try to avoid the term
&ldquo;infection&rdquo; when speaking of the GPL. However, I used that word
in that particular article because, as I quoted directly in my
second paragraph, the reader who responded to me used that word. I
certainly did not intend to propagate the notion that the GPL has
virus-like attributes, in the sense of things &ldquo;which taint or
corrupt morally&rdquo; or &ldquo;cause...disease&rdquo;. I perhaps should have
used the word &ldquo;inheritance&rdquo; instead, as I have done in my other
writings about the GPL, because that word has more positive
implications. Indeed, I have recently started to use the term
&ldquo;reciprocity&rdquo; to describe the effect of the GPL and similar
open-source licenses (including the MPL and CPL). Those licenses
require licensees to reciprocate by licensing their derivative
works under the same license as the work they were given. In
contract law terms, I contend, the reciprocity obligation is the
&ldquo;consideration&rdquo; you pay for the grant to you of the free license
to the original code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15f2580.0x16ea7c0"></a>A Perl in the Spam</h2></div></div><p>I have a few comments regarding David Bandel's Focus on
Software column in the March 2002 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. First, great job, David. Keep up the good work!
For me, your article is second only to Freshmeat when it comes to
discovering new software. Second, I was thrilled to see coverage of
Vipul's Razor
(<a href="http://razor.sourceforge.net" target="_self">razor.sourceforge.net</a>).
I've found it to be incredibly effective in weeding out my daily
dose of spam.</p><p>Although I am a long time Procmail user, I've often found its
recipes difficult (at best) and cryptic (at worst). I can't begin
to count the hours I've spent writing and debugging what should be
a fairly simple filter. I think many of even the more hard-core
Procmailers would be pressed to disagree with me on this
point.</p><p>So, it was with no small amount of giddiness that I
discovered Mail::SpamAssassin. This module (accessible via
<a href="http://CPAN.org" target="_self">CPAN.org</a>) is a plugin to the
Mail::Audit module. The true advantage is that, because it's Perl,
you can easily filter your e-mail through a Perl script. I have a
tutorial covering this at PerlMonks
(<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org" target="_self">www.perlmonks.org</a>)
under the Tutorials section entitled (appropriately enough) &ldquo;A
Beginner's Guide to Using Mail::Audit and Mail::SpamAssassin&rdquo;.
Using these modules gives you the power of Perl (renowned for its
ability to parse text) to filter your e-mail. I've been using this
for several months now, and I've found that approximately 99% of my
daily spam is filtered appropriately. And, I'm proud to report that
none of my e-mail has been lost. Again, you're doing a great job.
Keep it up!</p><p>&mdash;Stephen E. Hargrove</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15f2580.0x16eab30"></a>Sex Clarified</h2></div></div><p>Seymour Cray didn't like virtual memory and has been quoted
as saying: &ldquo;Memory is like sex; it's better when it's real.&rdquo;
Whereas Paul Barry (<i  >LJ</i> March 2002, Letters)
apparently wasn't aware of Seymour's quip, Linus certainly was; his
comment comparing software to sex is an obvious allusion. Perhaps
it's not that Linus needs to choose his words more carefully;
perhaps it's that authors should explain the literary significance
of these words for the younger generation.</p><p>&mdash;Collin Park</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15f2580.0x16eace8"></a>Netfilter Rescue</h2></div></div><p>After spending a few nights with <i  >LJ</i> [see
David Bandel's &ldquo;Taming the Wild Netfilter&rdquo; in the September 2001
issue, available at
<a href="../089/4815.html" target="_self">/article/4815</a>]
at hand's reach to configure my firewall, I came across the URL
<a href="http://www.boingworld.com/workshops/linux/iptables-tutorial" target="_self">www.boingworld.com/workshops/linux/iptables-tutorial</a>.
This is to me the best source I have found on Netfilter. I believe
the reference to Rusty Russel's document is a tribute to Rusty's
own work, but the document is not usable for a basic user like me,
a simple, average Linux user! Please to advertise this URL to your
user if they have troubles using the wild, wild Netfilter.</p><p>&mdash;Thomas Smets</p><p>For more on Netfilter, see David Bandel's more advanced

<i  >LJ</i> states: &ldquo;GTO is an acronym (Gran Turisimo
Omologato), which according to AltaVista means 'great accredited
tourism', which I suspect doesn't express the flavor of the
phrase.&rdquo;</p><p>He's right&mdash;Gran Turisimo refers to a racing class (Grand
Touring, or GT) of cars, and Omologato (&ldquo;homologated&rdquo; in English)
refers to the particular group of cars that was built specifically
to fulfill the racing organization's requirements. As it turns out,
Ferrari cheated on this; they never actually built the number of
cars they were supposed to, but the organization never called them
on it.</p><p>Most Pontiac dealers, when asked where the GTO moniker came
from, were at a loss to explain any of this when the acronym was
tacked onto the 389-engined version of the Pontiac Tempest.</p><p>&mdash;David Spellman</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15f2580.0x16eb268"></a>Speedier PHP</h2></div></div><p>I found a small problem when using the caching PHP file [see
Bruno Pedro's &ldquo;Improving the Speed of Web Scripts&rdquo; in the March
2002 issue of <i  >LJ</i>]. The md5 hash is generated
by using the PHP_SELF name of the called PHP script. But what if I
generate content depending on the query string? I changed from
PHP_SELF to REQUEST_URI, so it generates a unique cache file per
unique parameters. This way I saved 90% execution time compared to
running against my MySQL data sources.</p><p>&mdash;Kai Kretschmann</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15f2580.0x16eb420"></a>Erratum</h2></div></div><p>In the March 2002 issue, on page 94, &ldquo;'Using Mix-ins with
