Meals Special</h2></div></div><p>Ypsilanti, Michigan, February 4, 2002&mdash;Linux, the open-source
operating system, is at the heart of a popular new recipe service,
<a href="http://recipesbyemail.com" target="_self">recipesbyemail.com</a>.
Developed by Tap Internet, this service allows anyone with an
e-mail client to search hundreds of recipes quickly and
easily.</p><p>&ldquo;It was something originally done as a proof-of-concept for
a client&mdash;a database searchable through e-mail&rdquo;, said Michael
Kimsal, director of Tap Internet.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>But soon after we'd finished the core technology,
we decided to put up a &ldquo;sample&rdquo; to show other clients.
Recipesbyemail.com has quickly become a staple for many users on
the Internet to find just the recipes they're looking for.</p></blockquote></div><p>A sizable percentage of the loyal users have turned out to be
blind, due primarily to the fact that many web sites are so wrapped
up in JavaScript rollovers and fancy flash animation that users
relying on text-to-speech systems cannot use them at all. &ldquo;It was
quite interesting to get e-mails from some of these users because
it was something I'd never even considered before&rdquo;, said Kimsal.
</p><p>&ldquo;We intentionally keep the e-mails text-only to ensure
maximum compatibility whether you're using Outlook or a Palm Pilot
or a cell phone&rdquo;, said Kimsal. &ldquo;By building on Linux, we were
able to do this on a shoestring and still provide value to the
users, many of whom don't have very fast connections or modern
browsers.&rdquo; The system is built on Slackware Linux, using a
combination of Perl, MySQL, procmail and PHP.</p><p>&ldquo;We will be introducing a new feature soon to allow users to
send in their own recipes, which we hope will help increase
interest in the system even more.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;Recipesbyemail.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15cb580.0x16c39d0"></a><i  >LJ</i> Index&mdash;May 2002</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Pentagon transactions, in trillions of dollars, for

Sputnik Wireless Network</h2></div></div><p>While Boingo (the new national wireless internet system
headed by EarthLink founder Sky Dayton) has been getting a lot of
attention, the three Linuxcare founders&mdash;Dave Sifry, Dave LaDuke
and Art Tyde&mdash;have been quietly building a system of their own&mdash;one
based on the sharing model pioneered by the Free Software, Open
Source and Linux movements. The company is Sputnik, and after a
cautious beginning, the service has finally been launched.</p><p>To put Sputnik in context, it helps to see a wireless network
(802.11b, or WiFi) as one of three things: 1) a closed wireless
Ethernet LAN, 2) a wireless way to get on the Net <span   class="emphasis"><em>for a
fee</em></span> or 3) a wireless way to get on the Net <span   class="emphasis"><em>for
free</em></span>. Any one of the three might show up in your
wireless client software when your laptop is within range of a
&ldquo;hot spot&rdquo;. But only the last two offer ways to get on the Net.
The main difference between Boingo and Sputnik is that Boingo
aggregates businesses offering number two, while Sputnik extends
both numbers two and three&mdash;especially three. Think of it as a
fee-for-use value add-on to all the participating hot spots in the
world.</p><p>Here's the difference in frame of reference: Boingo comes
from the PC world, and Sputnik comes from the Linux/UNIX world.
Boingo offers users client software and service for a fee, while it
offers service providers a uniform way to interact with those
users, along with a straightforward revenue stream. Sputnik offers
users a way not only to take advantage of WiFi bandwidth, but to
serve it up as well. As with Linux, your laptop is both a client
and sever. You become a fully empowered part of the system.</p><p>With Sputnik Gateway Software, you distribute bandwidth while
you use it. Your laptop becomes an access point&mdash;a hot spot. But
instead of performing as an indiscriminate hub, Sputnik's gateway
acts as an intelligent router, sending traffic by priority to other
Sputnik members. The system expands with each new member. Dave
Sifry says, &ldquo;The gateway is a smart edge device, there is no need
to run a special client in order to use it. No software to download
onto your box! Totally standards-driven!&rdquo;</p><p>Here's how Glenn Fleishmann of 802.11b Networking News puts
it:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>This is totally amazing.
</p><p>The Sputnik folks have solved all the problems Boingo didn't
while offering an interesting, viral alternative. They solve the
firewall issue (local networks are protected while the AP is open),
authentication issue (captive portal without any work) and priority
issue (local users and Sputnik affiliates have QoS above random
folk).</p><p>Because being a member opens the rest of the network to you
for free, it plays on both aspects of the Internet in general and
wireless community networks in particular: enlightened
self-interest, as your adoption increases the size of the network
and the likelihood of others to join; and generous selflessness, as
you have nothing in particular to gain by allowing others to use
your access point and network. Only in combination do these two
virtues turn into a viral message.</p><p>Of course, some may cavil at this: it co-opts community
networks by offering a prefab, PC-based package that looks like a
closed box. Money is only taken from outsiders, those not generous
or sophisticated enough to become affiliates.</p></blockquote></div><p>I'm curious if this will provoke a firestorm of criticism.
</p><p>The gateway comes with a firewall. It also serves as an
application platform, does caching, tracks usage, handles
authentication, remote management and other things. Its core
technologies are also open source and available under the
GPL.</p><p>Subscribers pay a monthly fee, but for a limited time (as we
go to press), subscribers can roam for free. Sputnik is at
