Sometimes I can go a day without being struck, and sometimes only
minutes later, after doing <b  >chmod 755 /etc</b>, it's
back to 600. I thought this might be some protection feature in the
kernel to protect against bad memory or mass storage. I have
changed out memory, leaving only one stick fully qualified by my
motherboard maker, but to no avail. I can't play with the disks
right now. I reduced the number of processes to those listed in the
attached file. Is this a normal feature due to marginal hardware, a
misinstalled application or is my system hacked?</p><p>&mdash;Stan Katz,
<a href="mailto:stan@cloud9.net">stan@cloud9.net</a></p><p>Hardware issues will (almost) never cause filesystem changes
in this manner and certainly not in such a consistent manner. It's
time to look for applications (possibly malignant) that may be
causing the problem. You need to examine your other log
files&mdash;something might be a hint there. You only included messages
through the system boot, nothing from its operation. Start by
looking in all crontab files, tracing out processes that are run
from it. Also compare the system d&aelig;mon binaries you are
running, as well as other regularly used tools, against those on
your installation media to verify that they have not been replaced
with a Trojan horse. Finally, check for applications that are
setuid root, since those are a sure tip-off that you have been
compromised. However, it's unusual for a Trojan horse to restrict
the permissions on a directory. Without access to the system, its
log files and the ability to examine the files installed, we cannot
further analyze the problem.</p><p>&mdash;Chad Robinson,
<a href="mailto:crobinson@rfgonline.com">crobinson@rfgonline.com</a></p><p>You almost certainly have a cron job that is resetting the
permissions, or worse, a cracker kernel module that is messing
around with your system. You should try <b  >chmod 755 /etc;
chattr -i /etc</b> to make /etc immutable, which hopefully
will help make whatever program is resetting the permissions fail
(for a cron job, you may even get an error by mail). Typing
<b  >rgrep -r chmod /etc /var/spool/cron</b> may also
give you a clue as to what is changing the permissions.</p><p>&mdash;Marc Merlin,
<a href="mailto:marc_bts@valinux.com">marc_bts@valinux.com</a></p><p>This is not a feature. Sounds like a Trojan or misinstalled
program. This is a difficult problem to find. Try to do an
<b  >lsof /etc</b> to see if any program is currently
holding the directory open. This may give you a clue. Next, shut
down various services/programs until you find the offending
program. It might be easier to re-install your version of Linux
from scratch.</p><p>&mdash;Christopher Wingert,

configuring Red Hat 7.0 to be able to use Japanese. I have a
109-key Japanese keyboard and am using a Japanese 106 keymap that
works okay, despite being unable to use the Japanese-English switch
key. I enabled deadkeys and installed all the Japanese language
packets during installation. These packets, WNN and Kanna packets,
among others, start up on boot but don't activate for some reason.
Any help would be appreciated. I think I could solve it by getting
the right keyboard map. Japanese characters will appear on most
software in KDE and GNOME, but getting output from the keyboard is
the problem.</p><p>&mdash;Graeme Jensen,
<a href="mailto:magic@zae.att.ne.jp">magic@zae.att.ne.jp</a></p><p>I recommend you use a distribution that has been widely
tested with Japanese. You'll have better odds with those things
working out of the box. I have to admit I'm not sure which is the
Japanese distribution of choice today, but you may want to give
Turbolinux a try.</p><p>&mdash;Marc Merlin,
