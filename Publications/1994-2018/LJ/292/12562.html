<h1 class="title">Game Review: <em>Lamplight City</em></h1>

<h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">A well lit look into Grundislav Games' latest release. By Patrick
Whelan</h2>

<p>
The universe of <em>Lamplight City</em> is rich, complex and oddly familiar. The
game draws on that ever-popular theme of a steampunk alternative universe,
adding dashes of Victorian squalor and just a pinch of 1950's detective
tropes. Is it just a mishmash of clichés then? Yes, but it all works well
together to form a likable and somewhat unique universe—like a cheesy
movie, you can't help but fall in love with <em>Lamplight City</em>.

<p>
In <em>Lamplight City</em>, you play Miles Fordham, a disgraced detective turned PI
following the death of his partner in Act I at the hands of a mysterious
killer. Miles is accompanied by the ghostly voice of his partner Bill as
a sort of schizophrenic inner monologue. It's creepy, and it's a perfect example
of taking a classic trope and turning it into one of the game's biggest
strengths. Bill's monologues add witty flavour to the dry protagonist
and a way to explain details and scenarios to the player.

<p>
<em>Lamplight City</em> features multiple cases that are all tied together
with an overarching story. More impressively though is the overarching
story's effect on the individual cases. In my play-through, mistakes I
made in one case affected another and effectively led to another case becoming
unsolvable. This is a system I instinctively hated. It seemed unjustly
punitive to punish players for simply exploring dialogue options. Over
time, however, as the music and art slowly enveloped me into a universe I
truly enjoyed exploring and experiencing, I began to see how subtleties
are at the center of this universe. What at first is dismissed as
unimportant or underwhelming later appears as a subtle smack in the face,
with that familiar feeling of "Oh, I knew I shouldn't have done that!"
</p>

<p>
Patience is most certainly a virtue in <em>Lamplight City</em>, which is not to
say the game lacks flavor. In fact, the opposite is true. Many times
it's down to you to sweep through the data and discern fact from
fiction. It's important to note that <em>Lamplight City</em> isn't a logic
game—not really. There's no inventory, and although there are elements of
small physical puzzles, the game thrives on interpersonal relationships
and dissecting dialogues, not using some half-forgotten wrench on a
valve. It takes patience and discretion. This is not a simple mobile
game where enough spamming clicks will win the game. Speaking of winning,
let's talk about the end of the game—no spoilers, I promise!

<p>
On my first play-through of the final case, I failed, miserably, and I loved
it. Most games are too afraid to let the player fail. They'll respawn
you, give you tips or let you skip to the next part. When I failed in
<em>Lamplight City</em>, you can imagine my disbelief and slow, emerging grin as
the credits began to roll, the biggest case of the game
still unsolved. It's a nice breath of fresh air after the safe world of
invincible super heroes and perfect protagonists found in many popular
movies and games today.
</p>

<p>
All this is not to say, however, that you are doomed to failure. <em>Lamplight
City</em> provides you with the opportunity to establish yourself in
Miles Fordham. The universe of New Bretagne no longer feels distant but
real. You are the master of your own fate, and you, the player, are brought
into the fold and become invested in every lead and discovery. The game
does a great job at portraying a sense of responsibility onto the player
for making poor decisions, like annoying your wife, which in any other
game wouldn't affect a mighty protagonist nor penalize a player for
doing so.

<p>
So that's what <em>Lamplight City</em> does well, but there are plenty of areas
where it's quite not so exceptional. At the end of the day, it feels like a
small progression on a long-standing genre of point-and-click adventure
games—a small evolution, if you will, instead of a revolution in game
design. That's not necessarily a bad thing if you're looking for a
safe game you know you'll probably enjoy, but if you're looking to be
tested or truly excited by an innovative game, <em>Lamplight City</em> isn't for
you. With that said, the story is pleasantly compelling, and even if the
gameplay itself isn't riveting, the story is comparable to a long book,
slowly reeling you into its universe without you noticing until 2am when
you can't put the game down until you've gotten to the bottom of the case.
</p>

<p>
Just like other games of its genre, there are moments when you'll
be stuck and cursing to high heaven that you wish you'd payed more attention
to dialogue or details of previous cases. The game does a good job of
keeping you informed through a case book that contains the most relevant
information and clues, but this won't stop you from gallivanting across the city
multiple times a case talking with every NPC and revisiting every room,
hoping for some slight lead. I'll be honest; I watched my fair share
of play-throughs to find the next clue. This isn't a fault of the game
per se but a problem with the genre in general, often leaving players
dazed and confused with little direction. It's a feature of the genre, and
it can be extremely alluring or repulsive depending on the type of gamer
you are. This game sticks with its hard-core roots of butterfly-effect
dialogues, refusing to implement a hints system as in other similar
games, sometimes making it frustrating.

<p>
Finally, <em>Lamplight City</em> is a relatively short game at around ten hours for a
price tag of $15 USD. This falls far short of large "triple A games"
with thousands of developers creating vast expanses of land and hundreds
of characters with which to interact. However, with multiple endings, more
than 50
voiced characters and a uniquely charming art style, <em>Lamplight City</em> has
a great replay-ability value, and there are still cases I haven't totally
solved. The price, although not entirely competitive with huge games, is
fair enough for an intriguing and engaging story that will undoubtedly
have you playing again!
