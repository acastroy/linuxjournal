<h1 class="title">CloudWatch Is of the Devil, but I Must Use It</h1>

<h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Let's talk about Amazon CloudWatch. By Corey Quinn</h2>

<p>
For those fortunate enough to not be stuck in the weeds of Amazon Web
Services (AWS), CloudWatch is, and I quote from the official 
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch">AWS description</a>, "a monitoring and
management service built for developers, system operators, site reliability
engineers (SRE), and IT managers." This is all well and good, except for the
part where there isn't a single named constituency who enjoys working with
the product. Allow me to dispense some monitoring heresy. 
</p>

<p>
Better, let me describe this in the context of the 14 <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/principles">Amazon
Leadership Principles</a> that reportedly guide every decision Amazon makes.
When you take a hard look at CloudWatch's complete failure across all
14 Leadership Principles, you wonder how this product ever made it out
the door in its current state. 
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
"Frugality"</h3>

<p>
I'll start with billing. Normally left for the tail end of articles like
this, the CloudWatch billing paradigm is so terrible, I'm leading with
it instead. You get billed per metric, per month. You get billed per
thousand metrics you request to view via the API. You get billed per
dashboard per month. You get billed per alarm per month. You get charged for
logs based upon data volume ingested, data volume stored and "vended logs"
that get published natively by AWS services on behalf of the customer. And,
you get billed per custom event. All of this can be summed up best as
"nobody on the planet understands how your CloudWatch metrics and logs get
billed", and it leads to scenarios where monitoring vendors can inadvertently
cost you thousands of dollars by polling CloudWatch too frequently. When the
AWS charges are larger than what you're paying your monitoring vendor, it's
not a wonderful feeling. 
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
"Invent and Simplify"</h3>

<p>
CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch Events, Custom Metrics, Vended Logs and Custom
Dashboards all mean different things internally to CloudWatch from what you'd
expect, compared to metrics solutions that actually make some fathomable
level of sense. There are, thus, multiple services that do very different
things, all operating under the "CloudWatch" moniker. For example, it's not
particularly intuitive to most people that scheduling a Lambda function to
invoke once an hour requires a custom CloudWatch Event. It feels overly
complicated, incredibly confusing, and very quickly, you find yourself in a
situation where you're having to build complex relationships to monitor
things that are themselves far simpler.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
"Think Big"</h3>

<p>
All business people, when asked what they want from a monitoring platform,
will respond with something that resembles "a dashboard" or "a
single pane of glass view". CloudWatch offers minutia up the wazoo, but
it categorically offers no global view, no green/yellow/red status
indicator that gives you even a glimmer of the overall health of your site.
Want a graph of each core in your instance's CPU for the past 30
seconds? Easy! Want to know if your entire company should be putting out the
burning fire that is the current production state of your website? Keep
looking—CloudWatch has nothing to offer you.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
"Insist on the Highest Standards"</h3>

<p>
By its very nature, CloudWatch feels like small thinking. The entire
experience, start to finish, smacks of "what's the absolute least we
could do and get away with it?" They built their MVP, and then just
sorta...stopped, frozen in amber. They created a set of building blocks,
except they didn't solve the problem of "how do I monitor my AWS resources?"
Instead, it feels like the entire team phoned it in and let a large market
of monitoring vendors develop as a result. None of those vendors have the
level of access to the raw data that CloudWatch does; all of them have built
better products. You'd think the CloudWatch team would take a clue from
the innovation that's rapidly happening in this space, but that'd
require someone to <strong>Learn and Be Curious</strong>.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
"Are Right, a Lot"</h3>

<p>
Recent data is "eventually consistent", so you always get graphs like the
one shown in Figure 1.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="CloudWatch Graph" src="12565f1.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 1. Example CloudWatch Graph</p>
</div>

<p>
Here in reality, that would be a terrifying thing to see on an <em>accurate
dashboard</em>—something is obviously very wrong with your site! For better or
worse, the "accurate" description doesn't apply to CloudWatch, and that's
just how your graphs always look. "Your metrics will be eventually
consistent" is very nearly the last thing you want to hear about your
monitoring platform, second only to "what metrics?" This ties directly
to...
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
"Earn Trust"</h3>

<p>
Let me be very clear here—the real issue isn't the ingestion problem.
Absolutely every vendor on the planet has the same issue—you can't
display data you don't have. Where CloudWatch drops the ball is in
exposing this behavior to the end user without explanation as to what's
going on. Thus, until you grow accustomed to it, you have a heart-stopping
moment of "what the hell just happened to the site" whenever you
glance at a dashboard. This conditions you to be entirely too calm when
looking at sensible dashboards when a disaster just happened. If you trust
what the CloudWatch dashboards show you, you're making a terrible
mistake.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
"Dive Deep"</h3>

<p>
If you're using Lambda or Fargate, you have no choice but to use CloudWatch
Logs, wherein searching for everything is absolutely terrible. If you're
using CloudWatch Logs to diagnose anything, congratulations: you're
diving so deep, you may drown before making it back to the surface. 
For example, if I have a Lambda function that throws an error, in order to
diagnose the problem, I must:
</p>

<ul><li>
Find the fact that it encountered an error in the first place by looking at
the invocation error CloudWatch dashboard. I also could set up a filter to
run a continuous query on the logs and alert when something shows up, except
that isn't natively supported—I need a third-party tool for that (such
as
PagerDuty).</li>

<li>
Go diving into a variety of CloudWatch log groups and find the one named
after the specific erroring function.
</li>

<li>
Scroll manually through the many, many, many pages of log groups to find the
specific invocation that threw an error. 
</li>

<li>
Realize that the JSON object that's retained isn't enough to troubleshoot
with, cry in despair, and go write an article just like this one. 
</li>

<li>
Do some quick math and realize I'm paying an uncomfortable percentage of my
AWS bill for a service that's only of somewhat marginal utility at best.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
"Deliver Results"</h3>

<p>
All of your metrics, all of your logs—they're locked away inside
CloudWatch's various components. You're not going to find a
"page me when this threshold is exceeded" option in CloudWatch; your
options are relegated to "design an alert delivery pipeline with baling
wire and SNS" or pay a non-AWS vendor for another monitoring product. 
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
"Customer Obsession"</h3>

<p>
CloudWatch keeps all of your metrics. It keeps your logs. It lets you build
custom dashboards to view your metrics all in one place. The building blocks
of a great service are already here—it's the expression of that utility
that falls short, sometimes drastically. The fact that large monitoring
vendors are premier sponsors of AWS events would be laughable if CloudWatch
ever were to get its act together. You'd not need a third party to make
sense of a pure AWS environment, and many of them would starve to death as
they grow too weak to interrupt your conversation to ask if they can scan
your badge. Choosing to use CloudWatch vs. literally anything else is like
buying a car. "Why yes, I would like to buy the Yugo instead of the Honda.
After all, it checks all the boxes of technically being a car, so it's fine,
right?" 
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
"Disagree and Commit"</h3>

<p>
It may very well be that the root cause of many of CloudWatch's failings
comes from the product engineers who built it misunderstanding this
(admittedly slippery!) Leadership Principle. It's envisioned as
passionately expressing your reservations about a decision, but once
it's reached that, you commit to the decision that was made.
Unfortunately, it appears that the engineering teams responsible for
CloudWatch decided to "Disagree in Commits" and inflict their
arguments upon the world in the form of the product. 
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
"Ownership"</h3>

<p>
If I were to go on the internet and post about how terrible virtually any
other AWS service was, people would rally to that service's defense.
It's the internet; people will do that. But when these and many more
similar comments about CloudWatch appear, and nobody from AWS pipes in to
say "wow, I'm sorry, why do you feel that way?", it's
abundantly clear that if any people on the CloudWatch team really care about
the product, they've been locked in a malfunctioning bathroom stall for
the better part of a decade. <a href="https://twitter.com/shinzui/status/788939026996744192">These</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12235003">comments</a> go back at least that far, but
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/8n3fpz/is_cloudwatch_logs_really_terrible_or_am_i_just/dzsz8qg">Amazon</a>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/4zhgtl/how_do_you_feel_about_aws_cloudwatch_how_do_you">is</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/guisim/status/248394260704014336">totally</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/calebhailey/status/1032800895203864576">on</a>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14604644">it</a>, rocking
the company's <strong>"Bias for Action"</strong> principle. 
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
"Hire and Develop the Best"</h3>

<p>
The people who build CloudWatch aren't terrible at their jobs; I
genuinely believe they don't quite grasp how their product is perceived.
Given that it's poor form to write a rant like this and not offer
suggestions for positive improvement, here are some product enhancements I'd
like to see:
</p>

<ul><li>
Give me the option to rate-limit API calls at arbitrary levels rather than
being surprised at month end by a bill that's approximately Zanzibar's
GDP.</li>

<li>
"Here's an error that your Lambda function threw, here's the log output from
that specific function" should be at most two clicks away—not 30.</li>

<li>
If your dog has a litter of 14 puppies, perhaps you don't need to name
all of them subtle variations of the term "CloudWatch". The proliferation of
services and companies that all start with the word "Cloud" is the subject
of a completely separate rant.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please don't misunderstand me. I use, enjoy and promote AWS services,
and I'm considered to be "an authentic voice" largely because in
addition to praising things that are wonderful, I'll call out things
that aren't, as I've just done. I've built my career and
business on working within that ecosystem. I find AWS employees to be
intelligent and well-intentioned, and most of their services quite good.
CloudWatch could get there with some work, but it's got a number of very
painful usability issues that keep it from being good, let alone great.
