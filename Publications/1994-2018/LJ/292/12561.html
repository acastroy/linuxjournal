<h1 class="title">Review: the Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition Laptop</h1>


<h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">A look at Dell's thin and sleek XPS 13 Developer Edition laptop that
now ships with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS pre-installed. By Petros Koutoupis</h2>

<div class="caption">

<p class="caption"></p>
</div>

<p>
Canonical recently made an official announcement on its
company blog stating that the Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition laptop
(that is, Project Sputnik) now ships with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver)
pre-installed. Upon reading this, I quickly reached out to Dell asking to review
the laptop. I'm a Linux developer, and when a developer edition laptop
is marketed with Linux pre-installed, I <em>need</em> to experience it for
myself. The laptop eventually arrived, and like a child on Christmas morning,
I excitedly pulled the device out of the box and powered it up for the
first time.
</p>

<p>
This is a pretty rock-solid notebook. The device is very light and easy
to carry—meaning, it's mobile (which is very important in my book),
thin and sleek. Not only does the device look good, but it also performs
very well.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
General Specifications</h3>

<p>
In my possession is the 7th generation of the Dell XPS 13 Developer
Edition laptop. This generation ships with an Intel Core i7 8th Gen
microprocessor. It is a four-core, eight-threaded (hyperthreaded) i7-8550U
CPU operating at a 1.8GHz frequency. With this configuration, the system
itself reports eight CPUs. The system is installed with 16GB of RAM.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
First Impressions</h3>

<p>
Upon first boot, you're greeted with a Dell
welcome screen followed by a generic set of Ubuntu-related questions
(such as license agreement, keyboard layouts, timezone and so on). Toward
the end, you are given an option to create a recovery USB image, which
could be very handy one day. If you opt out of creating one, no worries,
you can go back and create one at a later time.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="System Configuration" src="12561f1.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 1. The Dell Recovery Media Menu</p>
</div>

<p>
The first thing I did, after logging in to my user session for the very
first time, was run a software update.
</p>

<p>
Although this does not at all relate to the quality of the device, I did
find it a bit strange that the operating system was pre-installed with
both Chrome and Chromium web browsers. I'm not sure why anyone would need
both, but they both were there. If you're a Firefox user, you'll
need to install it from the Ubuntu Software center.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Input Controls</h3>

<p>
One of the most important aspects of any computing device is its
input controls (keyboard, mice and so on). The keyboard
feels comfortable—that is, with the exception of the positioning
of the PgUp/PgDn keys. Those two keys are very close to the left and
right arrow keys. I'm sure, over time, I'll end up getting used
to it, but during the course of my review, I constantly and
accidentally pressed the PgDn key while navigating my way around in a terminal
and text editor. Again, the keyboard feels nice. It's responsive,
and the throwback from when you press the keys down feels just about
right. Although, <em>why</em> is there still a Windows icon
for the Super key?! I jest.
</p>

<p>
I also do appreciate the backlit keypad. You even can toggle
the backlight on and off manually. This backlight also fades to off when the keys
haven't been pressed in some time. Although, I don't recall what
that idle time or timeout is set to.
</p>

<p>
The touchpad is very responsive as well—maybe a bit too sensitive. I
find myself accidentally closing tabs or selecting things I never
intended to select. By default, Ubuntu enables natural scrolling
among a few other touchpad-specific features.
</p>

<p>
The notebook comes with a touchscreen bonded to the display. I
always find it a bit awkward trying to make use of a touchscreen
while maneuvering between a keyboard and a trackpad, but that's just
me. However, I do see the value in it when it comes to testing and debugging
applications intended for mobile, embedded or web use. 
I did notice a couple things with the touchscreen:
</p>

<ol><li>
Although it's responsive and calibrated accordingly, not all windows are
created equal. I had no issue moving GNOME native windows and applications
around the screen, so long as it was <em>not</em> touching the edges
of the top, bottom and sides (I thought that was weird). But for whatever
reason, regardless of where I tried to hold down to drag the window of
the Chrome web browser, it just would not budge.
</li>

<li>
Because the physical display extends to nearly the edges of
both the top and the sides of the lid, every time I went to adjust the
angle/tilt of the screen (from the left side), my large fingers would
activate whatever was positioned on the Dock right underneath it.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
What I do find a bit frustrating is that I am not able to disable
the touchscreen from the Ubuntu Settings panel, unless it is very well
hidden somewhere. The only way that I believe this can be done is through the Xorg
configuration files.
</p>

<p>
<em>Overall rating: 4/5.</em>
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Display</h3>

<p>
The display is absolutely amazing, and by amazing, I mean
<em>beautiful</em>. Everything is very crisp and clean. As a software
developer, I definitely can appreciate all of the available screen real
estate. I live in the terminal, and more specifically, I use my preferred
developer tools: vi and grep. It is a 16:9 screen scaling to a 3840 x
2160 resolution (4K). So, needless to say, there's plenty of room
for me to open one or more terminal windows on the same screen.
</p>

<p>
The screen resolution is so large, some applications don't
necessarily scale as well as the rest of the desktop environment. You
can go to the Settings→Devices→Displays menu and change the value
of the Scale field from the default 200% to something more, but some of
the other applications may not comply with the changes (a good example
is GIMP). 
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Display Configuration" src="12561f2.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 2. The Display Configuration Menu</p>
</div>

<p>
Right before I dove into this area, I went to the Ubuntu Software Center
and installed the graphic editor. The application was loaded almost as
soon as the installation was complete, and it was immediately apparent
that the icons and options of both trays did not scale like the rest of
the operating system.
</p>

<p>
<em>Display overall rating: 5/5.</em>
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Audio</h3>

<p>
I really enjoy the quality of the onboard speakers. I am streaming
audio through it while typing this review, and it sounds pretty darn
good. Everything is clear and crisp, as one would hope.
</p>

<p>
The microphone worked as expected, and the folks on the other end of
my video chat were able to hear my voice with little to no interference
or background noise.
</p>

<p>
<em>Audio overall rating: 5/5.</em>
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Power Consumption</h3>

<p>
Power consumption and battery life can make or break a device intended
to be used for mobile computing. If you can't get this right, 
what's the point? Overall, I am extremely impressed with the power
consumption of this device.
</p>

<p>
To put this into perspective, I was running from battery for 30 minutes
while navigating in a browser and writing my notes for this review in
Google Docs, and 95% of the battery is still remaining—not bad. Of course,
if I were to increase the workload on this machine, that number would
quickly drop.
</p>

<p>
As one would expect, the backlight of the panel dims to help conserve
energy, and you also have the option to reduce the brightness or turn
off the backlight underneath the keypad. You can do other things
to reduce the power consumption as well. For example, if it isn't being used,
it may be to your advantage to disable Bluetooth.
</p>

<p>
Fast-forward a few days: the notebook has been off of the charger for three
days now. I've been routinely going back to the device (and waking it up
from hibernation) to use it for minor tasks here and there throughout the
course of those same three days. The notebook is still above 60% battery. For
a four-core device, this is <em>really</em> good.
</p>

<p>
As an added bonus, you can check battery state quickly without
opening up the lid and logging in to your session. The left side of the
notebook has a power gauge where by pressing a button, you are given a
general and visual approximation.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<em>Power consumption overall rating: 5/5.</em>
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Performance</h3>

<p>
Boot-up time was mostly reasonable. Although I didn't exactly take
a stopwatch to it, it felt to me as if I was at the login screen for 15
seconds after I pressed the power button. Now, I'm not entirely sure
what's going on under the hood before the operating system begins
to load, but in my personal opinion, I was expecting something a bit
faster when running off of an NVMe SSD. Either way, even 15 seconds is
<em>not</em> unreasonable. And unless I reboot after a system update
that requires it, I'll never power-cycle my machines.
</p>

<p>
Waking up from a sleep or hibernate state is also very quick. Although I do
not power off my notebooks, I instead close the lid to ensure that
my applications and their states are still present when I reopen the lid
and reawaken the device. Within a second or two, I am prompted with the
login screen.
</p>

<p>
To test the system's overall performance, I decided to build three
separate Linux kernels simultaneously, all different versions:
</p>

<ul><li>
4.14.67</li>

<li>
4.18.5</li>

<li>
4.19-rc2</li>
</ul>

<p>
What really impressed me was the speed at which the system was able to
untar the archives. For instance, the 4.19-rc2 gzip file was approximately
154M in size and took less than four seconds to uncompress—3.961
seconds to be exact. Not bad!
</p>

<p>
When it came down to preparing and building these kernels all
simultaneously, I was surprised that the base Ubuntu image for a developer
machine did not include the developer environments for things like the
C library or even the kernel. I needed to install header files from
libc-dev just to build things in C. Eh, those are minor details.
</p>

<p>
Back to building the kernels, I gave the exact same config
(x86_64_defconfig) of the kernel to all three and ran the build
simultaneously. All three completed within 25 seconds. Wow! Now, when I
parallelize the builds with the <code>-j</code> option in the
<code>make</code> command, the time
dropped to less than ten seconds. I mean, holy crap, wow! This <em>is</em>
a four-core hyperthreaded machine using NVMe. So, I would expect it to
perform, and it does just that. The 16GB of memory obviously helps a
whole lot.
</p>

<p>
Wireless network performance also was good and seemed to be very
responsive.
</p>

<p>
<em>Performance overall rating: 5/5.</em>
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
External Device Support and Peripherals</h3>

<p>
Now, aside from a single microSD slot and a headphones jack, everything
else is USB-C. This seems to be the trend nowadays, and it makes
sense now that newer devices to market all support the protocol. Even
the power adaptor connects over USB-C and will occupy a single USB-C port.
</p>

<p>
But, what does this mean for expandability? It means you are required
to buy adaptors and expanders to connect more devices, which includes
external monitors. Dell does provide the customer with a single USB-A to
USB-C adaptor, and in most cases, that may be enough. This
way, you can connect your USB thumbdrive or that external
hard drive—or maybe even that one developer microcontroller board to
communicate with its JTAG interface over serial.
</p>

<p>
Some folks may have issues with this, but honestly, I personally don't
mind. The protocol is much more superior than its predecessors, and it can
sustain more connections for those that require it. Truth be told, you
need to give Dell some credit here. Unlike some of its competitors,
Dell is at least easing your transition from USB-A to USB-C by providing
that adaptor. Those same competitors will sell you a similar adaptor
for $60 or more on their websites.
</p>

<p>
I also am pleasantly surprised that the operating system went out to my
local network and found my print server with zero effort on my part. As
soon as I went to printer settings, it already was listed and ready
to go.
</p>

<p>
The biggest problem I have is with the webcam. The webcam is oddly
positioned <em>beneath</em> the display (instead of at the 
top, as is typical). This means that in order to capture your face, you need
to adjust the tilt of your screen, which leads to an awkward display of
your face. And if you're on a video-conference call, everyone else will have
a nice view of your fingers typing away at the keyboard. I hope
future iterations of the XPS line will address this design issue.

</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">And the Rest</h3>

<p>
The software integration between Dell and Ubuntu seems to stand out
a lot—and I mean this in the most positive way. System updates include
Dell-specific hardware/firmware patches. This is huge.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Reboot Screen" src="12561f5.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 5. The System Doing a Hardward Updated after Rebooting from a Software Update</p>
</div>

<p>
I did experience a couple quirks or issues throughout this
write-up. Let me state the following disclaimer before getting into the
details of those quirks:
</p>

<p>
<em>The problems I'm about to describe have nothing to
do with the Dell hardware. They are focused on the Ubuntu operating
system running on that hardware. I've been observing this
exact same behavior in virtual machines (if applicable) and on other
non-Dell physical devices.</em>
</p>

<p>
Applications would sometimes randomly crash. I've observed this
with both the Update Manager and, again, with Nautilus. I'm not sure if
it's the version of Nautilus supported on Ubuntu 18.04, but regardless of
the environment that I use with this particular distribution and release,
the Nautilus file manager application routinely crashes and generates
a "report to Canonical" message. The problem continues to occur
with the latest Ubuntu package updates.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Nautilus File Manager" src="12561f6.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 6. A Reoccurring Software Crash in the Nautilus File Manager</p>
</div>

<p>
Another quirk relates to the almost-never-resolved Linux
problem: hibernate. To clarify, by default, Ubuntu places your machine in
a sleep state when it idles or if you close the lid of your laptop. After
some time, the machine transitions from sleep to hibernate mode.
</p>

<p>
Sleep saves your current state into memory and places your peripherals
into a low power mode. In hibernate mode, the saved state will be placed
to disk, and the device will be powered down completely. Ubuntu calls
this mode "suspend".
</p>

<p>
After six attempts to wake up the device from hibernation, only five were
successful. In that one case, I was not able to bring the machine back up,
and I
was greeted by a completely black screen with its backlight lit up. After
spending four minutes pressing every key and eventually pressing the
power button hoping it would do something, I gave up and
held down the power button to force a system shutdown and restarted it.
</p>

<p>
In that same one case, I did do something different. I closed the lid
while plugged in. I unplugged the device some time later and attempted to
reawaken it. I wonder if I hit some corner-case software bug handling
this transition.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, you can configure or customize the operating system's suspend
settings. For instance, you can extend the time it suspends from sleep
or just disable it completely for when the device is plugged in and/or
on battery power.
</p>

<p>
<em>Software integration overall rating: 4/5.</em>
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>
Overall, I had a very positive experience with the 7th generation Dell XPS
13. It's a powerful machine and fully capable of handling all sorts
of developer workloads. And if used in a professional environment, it's
very mobile as well. You can carry it from conference room to conference room and resume
your work with little to no disruption. Ubuntu is well integrated
with the machine, and it shows. You can't ask for more in a developer's
laptop. I definitely consider this device to be well worth the investment.
