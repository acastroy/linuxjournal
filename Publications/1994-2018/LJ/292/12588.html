<h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Fun with retro-coding a Roman numeral converter—I head back to my college years and solve me
homework anew! By Dave Taylor</h2>

<p>
I earned a bachelor's degree in computer science back in the dawn of
computing. Well, maybe it wasn't quite that long ago, but we did talk about Ada and
FORTRAN in class. As a UCSD alumnus, however, it's no surprise that UCSD
Pascal was the programming language of choice. Don't worry; no punch
cards and no paper tape were involved in my educational endeavors.
</p>

<p>
As with modern computer science study, we spent a lot of time coding
algorithms and solving problems and puzzles. I'm a board-gamer, so I was
quite happy to try to solve the "dining philosophers problem", the
"four color problem" or the "traveling salesman problem". You
might well have tried to solve the same darn problems.
</p>

<p>
One coding problem that has stuck with me is a Roman numeral conversion
program. As part of my first programming class, I recall it being a pretty
tricky problem, but we didn't have the internet or GitHub to scrounge
around for smart solutions or inspiration. 
</p>

<p>
So, in the spirit of retro-coding, let's build a script that can convert
Roman numerals into regular decimal equivalent values.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Roman Numerals</h3>

<p>
I know, you're saying "um, remind me, what are Roman numerals?",
even though you see them all the time in movies and books. You just ignore
the MCMLXIII that shows up as a copyright notice. What's funny is that
the general industry consensus is that studios use those Roman numerals
instead of the more understandable "Copyright 1963" to obfuscate the
age of the film (by the way, MCMLXIII = 1963).
</p>

<p>
It turns out that Roman numerals are interesting because they are essentially
grouped into logical segments. At its most basic, each letter has a specific
decimal value, so let's start there (see Table 1 for the values).
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Table 1. Roman Numerals and Their Values</h3>
<tgroup cols="8">

</tgroup>
<table>


<thead>
<tr>
<td>Symbol</td>
<td>I</td>
<td>V</td>
<td>X</td>
<td>L</td>
<td>C</td>
<td>D</td>
<td>M</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Value</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>50</td>
<td>100</td>
<td>500</td>
<td>1000</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

</table>

<p>
If you wanted to write the value 60 as Roman numerals, that's easy: LX.
Reverse the two values, however, and it's a completely different value:
XL = 40. Why? Because when a lower value symbol appears before a higher value
symbol, it's considered a reduction of that value. The fancy name for
this is <em>subtractive notation</em>.
</p>

<p>
In other words, LX = 50 + 10, but XL = L – X = 50 – 10.
</p>

<p>
Now you can see how the earlier value breaks into clusters of values based on
whether a subsequent value is higher or lower than the current value.
Here's the logic:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
MCMLXIII = M + CM + L + X + III = 1000 + 900 + 50 + 10 + 3
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The general rule involves a single character look-ahead. That is, the value 4
is represented as IV (literally 5 – 1), so while 8 is VIII, the value 9 is IX.
Fortunately, 8 will never be IIX because that violates the single value
subtraction, and the values always are adjacent so you won't see IM or
VC.
</p>

<p>
Got it? It's pretty easy, really, once you know the letter values and the
subtractive notation.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Writing a Roman Numeral Converter</h3>

<p>
Let's get to some coding.
</p>

<p>
The first challenge is to figure out how to convert individual Roman numeral
values to their decimal equivalent. We humans can just glance at the table
presented earlier and remember that L = 50, but we've got to teach the shell that
trick too.
</p>

<p>
This would be a perfect use for a two-dimensional array where the primary
index would be a character value, and the equivalent secondary value would be
the corresponding decimal value. Alas, one of the weaknesses of Bash is that
it doesn't support multi-dimensional arrays. 
</p>

<p>
I'm going to be lazy and just utilize a function with a case statement.
This also lets me support both uppercase and lowercase values:

</p>
<pre><code>
mapit() {
case $1 in
I|i) equiv=1 ;;
V|v) equiv=5 ;;
X|x) equiv=10 ;;
L|l) equiv=50 ;;
C|c) equiv=100 ;;
D|d) equiv=500 ;;
M|m) equiv=1000 ;;
* ) echo "Error: Value $1 unknown" &gt;&amp;2 ; exit 2 ;;
esac
}
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Recall that in Bash you can't have a function return a value, but you can
send parameters to the function. They are then accessible within the function
as positional parameters $1, $2, $3 and so on. Ergo <code>$1</code> is the
letter being mapped to a decimal value. The return value is the global
variable <code>$equiv</code>. It's a bit clumsy versus a more elegant language,
but...so it goes.
</p>

<p>
Let's put that snippet of code aside for a moment and look at the common
question of how to parse a string one character at a time. There are a ton of
different ways to figure out exactly how that should be done, but I'm
going to tap the nifty Bash function <code>seq</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>seq</code> command generates a sequence of values from the starting to ending
value—most easily at the command line:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ seq 3 7
3
4
5
6
7
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
This is where the Bash string functions are going to be really helpful!
Let's utilize two of them. First, <code>${#string}</code> returns the number
of characters in the string. Then the more complex reference of
<code>${string:start:num}</code> returns the substring starting at
<code>start</code> for <code>num</code>
characters from the variable <code>string</code>.
</p>

<p>
Put these three things together, and you have an elegant way to step through a
string, character by character. If the user-specified value is known as
<code>romanvalue</code> (so as to be maximally mnemonic, of course), this
simple <code>for</code> loop
breaks down the string:

</p>
<pre><code>
for index in $(seq 1 ${#romanvalue}) ; do
echo "Letter $index is ${romanvalue:index-1:1}"
done
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Now you can integrate that with the function <code>mapit</code> presented earlier.
Combined, you get this script:

</p>
<pre><code>
for index in $(seq 1 ${#romanvalue}) ; do
mapit ${romanvalue:index-1:1}
echo "${romanvalue:index-1:1} = $equiv"
done
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
The result? Let's decompose the earlier sequence:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sh roman.sh MCMLXIII
converting MCMLXIII
M = 1000
C = 100
M = 1000
L = 50
X = 10
I = 1
I = 1
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
It's pretty easy to sum it up:

</p>
<pre><code>
sum=$(( $sum + $equiv ))
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Without compensating for the subtractive notation, you'll find
that—incorrectly!—MCMLXII sums up to 2163. It makes sense: the
CM ended up as 1100
instead of 900, so it's exactly 200 off the correct value.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, there's a whole 'nother section of smarts needed in this
program—an algorithm that basically says,
"If the next value is greater than the current, subtract the current value
from the next. If not, add the current to the next value and add that to the
sum total."
</p>

<p>
The problem is that this means there's a fairly substantial change in the
code, because you can't just say "look up value, add it to sum", but
you need to implement a look-ahead concept.
</p>

<p>
And, that's exactly what I plan to cover in my next article, when I finish this
script and look at the reverse—one that lets you get the Roman numeral
equivalent of a decimal value. The latter is particularly interesting,
because
there's no Roman numeral greater than 1000, so given the notational
conventions, the max value is going to be 3*1000+999. 
</p>

<p>
Or is it? You tell me.
