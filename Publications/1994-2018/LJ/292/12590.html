<h1 class="title">Open Sauce: Time for Net Giants to Pay Fairly for the Open Source on
Which They Depend</h1>

<h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Net giants depend on open source: so where's the gratitude?</h2>


<p>
Licensing lies at the heart of open source.
Arguably, free software began
with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-1.0.html">the
publication of the GNU GPL in 1989</a>. And since then, open-source projects
are defined as such by virtue of <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">the licenses they adopt</a> and
whether the latter meet the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">Open Source
Definition</a>. The continuing importance of licensing is shown by the
periodic flame wars that erupt in this area. Recently, there have been two
such flarings of strong feelings, both of which raise important issues.
</p>

<p>
First, we had the incident with <a href="https://lernajs.io">Lerna</a>, "a
tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages". It came about
as a result of the way the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has
been <a href="https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/1033084026893070338">separating
families</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44518942">holding children in
cage-like cells</a>. The Lerna core team was appalled by this behavior and
wished to do something concrete in response. As a result, it <a href="https://github.com/lerna/lerna/pull/1616">added an extra clause to the
MIT license</a>, which forbade a list of companies, including Microsoft,
Palantir, Amazon, Motorola and Dell, from being permitted to use the code:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
For the companies that are known supporters of ICE: Lerna will no
longer be licensed as MIT for you. You will receive no licensing rights and
any use of Lerna will be considered theft. You will not be able to pay for a
license, the only way that it is going to change is by you publicly tearing
up your contracts with ICE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Many sympathized with the feelings about the actions of the ICE and the
intent of the license change. However, many also pointed out that such a
move went against the core principles of both free software and open source.
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">Freedom 0 of the
Free Software Definition</a> is "The freedom to run the program as you wish,
for any purpose." Similarly, the Open Source Definition requires "No
Discrimination Against Persons or Groups" and "No Discrimination Against
Fields of Endeavor". The situation is clear cut, and it didn't take long for
the Lerna team to realize their error, and <a href="https://github.com/lerna/lerna/pull/1633">they soon reverted the
change</a>:

</p>
<blockquote><p>I apologize for making the rash decision to support the addition
of an unenforceable clause to the project's MIT license. I failed to
accurately assess the impact of this change, which led me to (incorrectly)
focus on the intent. Despite the most noble of intentions, it is clear to me
now that the impact of this change was almost 100% negative, with no
appreciable progress toward the ostensible goal aside from rancorous sniping
and harmful drama.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Lerna episode was a useful opportunity for the Open Source world to
remind itself that true freedom includes the freedom to use software in <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/08/an-analysis-of-censorship-in-chinese-open-source-projects">ways
that many might not approve of</a>. Stallman appreciated this early on, and
he wrote the post <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/programs-must-not-limit-freedom-to-run.html">"Why
programs must not limit the freedom to run them"</a> on the topic.
</p>

<p>
The other flare-up over licensing has been similarly instructive. It
involves <a href="https://redis.io">Redis</a>, "an open source (BSD
licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and
message broker". Here's the problem, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/07/commons-clause-stops-open-source-abuse">outlined
by Salil Deshpande</a>, Managing Director at Bain Capital Ventures, which has
invested in <a href="https://redislabs.com">Redis Labs</a>:
</p>

<blockquote><p>Amazon takes Redis (the most loved database in
StackOverflow's developer survey), gives very little back, and runs it as
a service, re-branded as AWS Elasticache. Many other popular open-source
projects including, Elasticsearch, Kafka, Postgres, MySQL, Docker, Hadoop,
Spark and more, have similarly been taken and offered as AWS products.
</p>

<p>
To be clear, this is not illegal. But we think it is wrong, and not conducive
to sustainable open-source communities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The response from Redis Labs was to append for certain add-on modules an
extra paragraph, known as the <a href="https://commonsclause.com">Commons
Clause</a>, to its open-source license. It includes the following: "Without
limiting other conditions in the License, the grant of rights under the
License will not include, and the License does not grant to you, the right to
Sell the Software."
</p>

<p>
Deshpande writes: "if you want to take substantially the same software that
someone else has built, and offer it as a service, for your own profit,
that's not in the spirit of the open-source community." But that's
incorrect. Both the Free Software Definition and the Open Source Definition
explicitly require that option. There's even a page all about <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html">selling free software</a>
on the main gnu.org site. Well known voices within the coding community were
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/open-source-licensing-war-commons-clause">more
or less unanimous</a>: the Commons Clause negates any open-source license it
is used in conjunction with, and really misses the point of free software.
</p>

<p>
That notwithstanding, the Commons Clause does spring from a legitimate
concern. As Deshpande points out, Amazon is making a lot of money offering
open-source programs on its cloud computing platform. In fact, its debt to
the hacker community goes much deeper: free software permeates the company
and its operations. Without open source's low costs and ability to scale,
Amazon might never have grown to become <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-amazon-com-trillion/amazon-touches-1-trillion-on-pace-to-overtake-apple-idUSKCN1LK1ZJ">the
world's second trillion-dollar company</a> by valuation.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, the same can be said of many of today's internet giants. Google
and Facebook are also built on a variety of open-source programs, and they 
probably would have struggled to achieve the rapid growth and today's high
profitability had they been forced to depend on proprietary code. 
</p>

<p>
It's true that all these companies "give back" to free software in various
ways. They have open-sourced some code that they have written; provided bug
reports and fixes to key programs; supported top free software coders by
employing them; and encouraged young people to join the Open Source world,
for example through <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">Google's
annual Summer of Code</a>.
</p>

<p>
Those are all welcome. But they are not enough. The decision to craft the
Commons Clause was driven largely by companies based around open source
seeing internet giants like Amazon deriving great financial benefit from
being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem">free
rider</a> on their efforts. That is neither fair nor sustainable. Indeed,
it is extremely foolish for companies like Google and Facebook to exploit
open source and its culture of frictionless giving. Ultimately, if these
companies that are highly dependent on free software don't start providing
serious financial support, paid directly to open-source projects and to their
associated companies, those resources will dwindle and may disappear.
</p>

<p>
They should pay not because the license forces them, but simply because it is
in their own interests to do so. That's particularly true at a time when the
big internet companies are increasingly being painted as the source of all
digital evil. Frankly, they need to do more on the public relations front if
they are to avoid punitive legislation being passed around the world.
Supporting open source generouslyâ€”with some very large and regular
cash paymentsâ€”would be an excellent way to do that. It would burnish
their public image, safeguard their core infrastructure and give a massive
boost to projects whose unstinting generosity enriches the entire world.
