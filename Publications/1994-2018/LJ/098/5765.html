    &ldquo;Many people waited a long time to have nice IDEs for Linux.
    While everyone else waited I just used Emacs.&rdquo;
    &mdash;Thanyne Harbaugh, President, Provo Linux Users Group
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2061580.0x21593a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Emacs is well known as an editor, but
calling Emacs an editor is like calling the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Queen
Mary</em></span> a boat. The source RPM for Emacs 21.1 is some
20MB&mdash;huge for an editor. You don't have to use all of it, but
sometimes it's nice to know it's there.
</p><p>Emacs is heavily customizable, which makes it very flexible.
For example, I am writing this article with Emacs and will spell
check it with Emacs. &ldquo;Well&rdquo;, I hear you saying, &ldquo;if it's good
for writing articles, it can't be very good for developing
software.&rdquo; That's where Emacs' flexibility and customization come
in; you can use it for either or for something completely
different. Want to see a shrink, play <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tetris</em></span>
or manipulate dates in the Mayan calendar? Emacs.</p><p>Emacs' customization comes in packages, called modes. Major
modes set Emacs up to do a particular sort of thing, such as the C
mode to edit C and C++ source or the psgml mode
(<a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/projects/about_psgml.html" target="_self">www.lysator.liu.se/projects/about_psgml.html</a>)
to edit the documentation after you've written your program. Minor
customizations provide added facilities to major modes. Show-paren
mode shows matching parentheses, and auto-fill mode allows you to
enter filled text without explicitly entering line breaks. Most
modes have variables to control their behavior, and you can modify
them temporarily or permanently.</p><p>Most users store their customizations in ~/.emacs, called the
&ldquo;dot Emacs&rdquo; file. For the curious, mine is on the Web at
<a href="http://w3.trib.com/~ccurley/emacs.init.html" target="_self">w3.trib.com/~ccurley/emacs.init.html</a>.
Others can be found at &ldquo;the very unofficial .emacs home&rdquo;,
<a href="http://www.dotemacs.de" target="_self">www.dotemacs.de</a>.</p><p>This article covers GNU Emacs version 21.1
(<a href="http://www.fsf.org/software/emacs/emacs.html" target="_self">www.fsf.org/software/emacs/emacs.html</a>).
XEmacs (<a href="http://www.xemacs.org" target="_self">www.xemacs.org</a>)
is also available on most Linux distributions and will probably do
everything I describe here.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2061580.0x2159870"></a>A Brief Program</h2></div></div><p>What I will do to show off Emacs as an integrated development
environment (IDE) is walk through the development of a short C
program and show you how to do it. We'll write the infamous Hello
World program known and loved by C programmers everywhere.</p><p>While this article shows C development, Emacs has support for
other languages as well, including C++, assembly, Scheme, Java,
Ada, IDL, Makefiles, Lisp (including Emacs Lisp, the language in
which much of Emacs is written) and FORTRAN. And that's just what
comes with Emacs. Add-on packages abound; there is even one for
Forth.</p><p>In addition, you can use Emacs for many other types of files.
When it comes time to document your program, you can use Emacs'
psgml mode to make editing the documentation source much easier.
There are modes for HTML and TeX as well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2061580.0x2159a28"></a>Directory Manipulation in Emacs</h2></div></div><p>The first thing we do is use Emacs' dired mode to create a
directory to put the program in. In dired mode, we type a
<b  >+</b>, and then enter the name of the directory to
create in the minibuffer at the bottom of the editor (Figure 1).
Press Return and Emacs creates the directory for us.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5765f1.large.jpg"><img src="5765f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Using Emacs' dired mode to create a directory for the
program&mdash;we've shrunk the window down to save space in the
magazine, but the essentials are there.
</p></div></div><p>The next thing we do is enter that directory, then create the
file hello.c with the usual keystrokes for visiting a file, Ctrl-X
Ctrl-F. Type the filename, <b  >hello.c</b>, into the
minibuffer and press Return. We now see Emacs ready with a new
buffer for our program.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2061580.0x2159df0"></a>Entering the Source</h2></div></div><p>The first thing any C programmer should do upon opening a new
file is enter a comment to say what the file does. So we press M-;
(M- for meta, or Alt on most PC keyboards) and get a C++-style
comment delimiter and the cursor ready to take our comment. The
reason I get a C++ comment is because I have customized Emacs to
put me into C++ mode for C. You will probably get a C-style comment
delimiter, <b  >/* */</b>, with the cursor in the middle
ready for you to type in your comment. If you'd rather use C++
comments, do M-X <b  >C++-mode</b>.</p><p>Then we add a timestamp, all defined by Emacs' timestamp
minor mode. Again, this is something I have customized; you may not
get it to work.</p><p>A C program has to have a main function, and so we type it in
GNU style: the return type on one line, followed by the function
declaration on the next. Notice as we type away that syntax
highlighting takes effect (Figure 2).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5765f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Entering the function declaration for main in Emacs. Note
the syntax highlighting and also the parentheses matching.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2061580.0x215a210"></a>Electric C</h2></div></div><p>Now for one of the really fun things about Emacs: Electric C.
Press certain characters, and Emacs takes care of the indentation
and the pretty printing for us. Having completed the function
declaration, in a normal editor one would press Return, type a left
brace ({), then press Return and Tab. Not in Emacs; just type a
left brace and Emacs does the rest. (If it doesn't work the first
time, undo the brace with Ctrl-_, then press Ctrl-C Ctrl-A to
toggle electrification.)</p><p>Now we type in a line of code. Type in
<b  >printf</b>, then a space. Now it's time for a
parenthesis. While we're at it, to keep our parentheses balanced,
it's also time for a closed parentheses. So press M-(, that's Alt-(
on a PC keyboard. Emacs puts in the pair of parentheses and moves
back a character so we can type code inside. And, we type in
<b  >"Hello, wolrd.\n"</b>, typo and all (we'll come back
to that).</p><p>Instead of pressing Return, we enter another electric
character, Ctrl-J. The astute reader has already noticed that we
left out a semicolon. Watch what happens. Ctrl-J
<span   class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> move us down a line and indent to just
below the &ldquo;p&rdquo; in &ldquo;printf&rdquo;. In this case, it doesn't. Emacs
assumes that we are continuing from the line above, so it indents
further. Even to a software engineer who has only had his first cup
of coffee for the day, this should be an alert that something is
wrong. Yes, indeed, we missed our semicolon. We undo the Ctrl-J
with Ctrl-Shift-- (that's Control-Shift-Hyphen) and type in the
semicolon. Hey! Semicolons are electric, too! But notice how Emacs
prevented a bug from happening? That's even cooler!</p><p>Now, of course, it's time to enter a right brace in order to
end the function main. Because our electric semicolon indented for
us, do we have to backspace back to the left column? Nope, just
type the right brace.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2061580.0x215a528"></a>Compiling and Testing</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have our program written, we save it (Ctrl-X
Ctrl-S) and run a test compile. Since this is a single-source file
program, we don't need a make file. (But there is a make file mode,
which I will leave as an exercise for the student.) Instead, we
compile from within Emacs, M-X <b  >compile</b>. This
results in a proposed compile command line, in this case the
default <b  >make -k</b>. Since we don't have a make
file, we use the down arrow key and write our own compile
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -g -o hello hello.c
</pre><p>The -g option compiles in information for GDB, the GNU
Debugger, and the -o option tells the linker that the output file
is to be named &ldquo;hello&rdquo;. And we get, much to our amazement, a
perfect compile (Figure 3).
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5765f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. A Successful Compile in Emacs
</p></div></div>

</p><p>Now to test it. Feeling brave&mdash;or lucky&mdash;we fire up a shell
under Emacs with M-X <b  >shell</b> and execute the
program (Figure 4). However, something isn't quite right. We
misspelled &ldquo;world&rdquo;. Oops.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5765f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Executing the Program from a Shell inside Emacs
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2061580.0x215abb0"></a>Spell Checking</h2></div></div><p>But rather than just correct that error, we can spell check
our comments and strings. To do that, we go back to the source
buffer with Ctrl-X Ctrl-B Return. Now either use the pull-down menu
(Tools&mdash;&gt;Spell-Checking&mdash;&gt;Spell-Check Comments) or do M-X
<b  >ispell-comments-and-strings</b> (now is a good time
to see the Sidebar on Tab completion). We press the spacebar to
bypass IDE and 0 to accept world instead of wolrd (Figure 5). Then
Ctrl-X Ctrl-X to save our changes.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5765f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Spell Checking Source Code in Emacs
</p></div></div><p>Now that we have that done, it's time to compile again. Like
Bash, Emacs remembers our command history, so M-X followed by one
or more up arrow keys gets us back to the compile command. Press
Return. Emacs shows us our last compile command line. It looks
good, so press Return again.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2061580.0x2553170"></a>Debugging with Emacs</h2></div></div><p>Emacs is also a front end for GDB. To enter GDB mode, do M-X
<b  >gdb</b>. Emacs comes up with a proposed command
line, &ldquo;gdb&rdquo;. We add the name of the executable file to debug,
<b  >hello</b>, and press Return. This tosses us into gdb
mode, with the gdb prompt ready for action. We set a breakpoint at
the function &ldquo;main&rdquo; with the gdb command <b  >break
main</b>. (Tab completion works here, too.) Then type
<b  >run</b> to run the program to our first
breakpoint.</p><p>GDB shows us the input values to the program. Emacs, however,
has the other window set up to show the source. As we step through
the program, Emacs will indicate the next line to execute with an
arrow in the source window. We can even switch buffers (Ctrl-X
Ctrl-O) and edit the source as the fancy strikes. Pressing N
executes one statement. In this case, that statement produces
output, which we see in the GDB window. One more N and GDB informs
us that the program exited with a return value of, well,
garbage.</p><p>We recall that the successful completion of a program should
generally return zero. We should add that to the program. So we
quit GDB and switch to the source-code window. The cursor is just
in front of the final brace of the program. To add the return code,
we enter <b  >return (0)</b>.</p><p>We won't get very fancy in our show-and-tell. But for
anything more sophisticated than what we do here, you will find a
lot of repetition before getting to the interesting part of the
program execution. Therefore, you can prepare an init file for GDB,
which is a list of GDB commands that are executed in the order GDB
encounters them in the file. So you can automate anything GDB can
do&mdash;which is quite a lot.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2061580.0x2553538"></a>Compilation Debugging</h2></div></div><p>Being in a hurry, we neglected our semicolon and pressed
Return instead of Ctrl-J. Try a compile. Do M-X and the up arrow
keys until you have &ldquo;compile&rdquo; in the minibuffer, then press
Return. The command line is good, so press Return again.</p><p>Oops! We have an error. To locate the error in the source, we
press Ctrl-X `. This puts the first error message at the top of the
compile output buffer and the cursor at the offending line. The
error is before the brace, so we look at the end of the previous
line. How terrible; we've committed the classic newbie programmer's
error and left out the semicolon. So we press the left arrow key
and add the semicolon. Then we save our work with Ctrl-X
Ctrl-S.</p><p>Emacs' compilation mode is set up to detect error messages
from a great many compilers (Microsoft Visual C++, for example) and
not only C compilers. Emacs also recognizes the output from
weblint, an HTML checker.</p><p>Notice that the electric semicolon did two things: it
indented our line for us, which was nice of it, but it also
inserted a line between the &ldquo;return&rdquo; statement and the closing
brace, positioning the cursor ready to add another line. Well, that
isn't what we wanted. So we undo it with M-Shift--. Now we override
the electric semicolon and insert a semicolon with Ctrl-Q ;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2061580.0x2553748"></a>Pretty Printing</h2></div></div><p>It would be nice to have the program all properly indented,
so we use Emacs' indentation tools. First we select a region to
indent. To select the entire program, Ctrl-X H. Then we indent with
Ctrl-M-\ (that's Control meta-backslash). To look at the results,
we hide the compilation buffer with Ctrl-X 1 and admire our
handiwork (Figure 6). That done, we compile once more (M-X
<b  >compile</b> Return Return). This time we are
successful.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5765f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Pretty Printing with Emacs
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2061580.0x2553a60"></a>Electric Comments and Auto-Fill Mode</h2></div></div><p>Of course, any programmer knows to comment their code
copiously. First, we need a general comment to tell what the
program does. So we enter that in the source file right after the
timestamp (Figure 7). Start with Emacs' command to start a comment,
M-;. Notice as you type that the text simply wraps around (as
indicated by the arrows in the left and right margins). That's
ugly, so we press M-Q to &ldquo;fill&rdquo; the paragraph. Notice that the
C++ comment delimiters are inserted at the beginning of each line
(Figure 8).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5765f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Entering a Comment (or Other Text) into Emacs
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5765f8.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. The Same Comment, Now &ldquo;Filled&rdquo;
</p></div></div><p>We can arrange to fill text automatically with M-X
<b  >auto-fill-mode</b>, but this will fill our C source
as well, which is not what we want. If you like, you can turn
auto-fill mode on for comments and off again for source.</p><p>You can also comment a line of code. Put the cursor anywhere
on the line, press M-; and continue. Emacs will put in the comment
delimiter at the end of the line and move the cursor to the
appropriate place to enter the comment. That will be the end of the
line for C++-style comments, but between the delimiters for C-style
comments, /* ... */.</p><p>And, don't forget to spell check your comments with M-X
<b  >ispell-comments-and-strings</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2061580.0x2554090"></a>Version Control with Emacs</h2></div></div><p>Emacs has a front end for CVS, RCS or SCCS, called VC. The
first two are free-software version control systems and come with
many Linux distributions. VC is smart enough to figure out which
one you are using. Most VC functions are handled with the key
sequence Ctrl-X Ctrl-Q or Ctrl-X V V. Depending on the present
state of the file, VC will check it in or out. If the file has
never been added to the version control system, Emacs will
determine that and check it in for you. When you check in a change,
Emacs will make a temporary buffer for the change comment, so you
have no excuse for ignoring that good programming habit.</p><p>This front end works with any document under version control.
For example, the Linux Documentation Project uses remote CVS to
control their linuxdoc and docbook source files. Even though I
contribute over a 56KBps dial-up line, I can use Emacs to make the
CVS process transparent.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2061580.0x25541f0"></a>Tags</h2></div></div><p>Tags are a database of function, and optionally, typedef
names are created with the program etags and stored in the file
TAGS. They are stored together with their locations, making it easy
to examine the definition of a function. To create a tags file for
C programs, run <b  >etags -t *.[ch]</b> from any shell.
You can use tags for many programming languages; run <b  >etags
--help</b> from a shell for a list.</p><p>Our minimal program has only one file and only one function.
Other developers should be so lucky; many C projects spread out
across multiple files in multiple directories. Tags will cover
complex situations like that as well. In fact, the more complex the
project, the better tags shine.</p><p>To examine the source for a function, use M-. (that's
meta-period). Start typing the name of the function and use tab
completion. If you haven't already specified a tags file to use,
Emacs will ask. Usually the default is exactly what you want
(Figure 9).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5765f9.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. Using the Tags Facility to Locate a Function
</p></div></div><p>Notice that the default function name is the word next to the
cursor in the source window. Tags mode lets you edit one file,
place the cursor over the name of a function to examine and go edit
that function with minimal keystrokes.</p><p>You can also display the source for the function in another
window, with Ctrl-X 4 .. This lets you examine multiple functions
simultaneously, as many functions as you can fit on the screen. If
you want to see every reference to a function, use M-X
<b  >tags-search</b>. To continue the search, use
M-,.</p><p>Also, tags are very useful for searching and replacing
function names within projects. For example, if I have a function
named Frodo and I want to rename it Gollum, I not only need to
change the function declaration, but I have to get every prototype
and every reference. So M-X <b  >tags-query-replace</b>
and away I go. Both of these search functions use regular
expressions, making them very powerful. You can browse C++ classes
with Ebrowse.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2061580.0x25547c8"></a>File Diffing</h2></div></div><p>Diffing is comparing two files, say two versions of a source
file. Most programmers are familiar with diff and patch. Emacs
provides a powerful front end for diff and patch. For one thing,
Emacs' ediff mode shows the two (or three) files in the editor one
above the other. The differences are highlighted on any display
capable of color (Figure 10). The entire line is indicated, and the
exact differences are indicated in different colors.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5765f10.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. Showing the Difference between Two Files
</p></div></div><p>Not only that, but you can use single-character commands to
move differences from one file to the other; <b  >a</b>
or <b  >b</b> moves the line from the A or B buffer,
respectively, to the other. This allows you to walk through two
files, compare them and accept or reject each difference.</p><p>To step through the two files one difference at a time, put
the ediff control panel in focus. Use the spacebar to advance and
the P key to go back (Figure 11). Ediff mode can keep up with
changes you make on the fly. Try adding a line to goodbye.c right
after the printf line, a call to flush();.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5765f11.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 11. The Control Panel for Emacs' Ediff Mode
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2061580.0x2554da0"></a>Help</h2></div></div><p>Emacs has a huge library of built-in help. The gateway to
Emacs' help is Ctrl-H. If you aren't familiar with Emacs at all,
get started with the tutorial, Ctrl-H T. If you are already
familiar with Emacs, you should walk through the tutorial; there's
always something to learn about Emacs.</p><p>If you are familiar with the GNU program Info, you already
know how to use Emacs' help system. Ctrl-H I gets you to the top
menu of the Info system. From there, <b  >Memacs</b> gets
you to the Emacs documentation. And, of course, the documentation
for Info is available from the top-level Info menu.</p><p>If you want documentation for other programs or for Linux
function calls, you can use Emacs as an Info reader. Or, you can
read the man pages from within Emacs. You can use Emacs as a front
end for Man with the command M-X <b  >manual-entry</b>.
Or you can have Emacs interpret the man page and display it for you
with the woman (WithOut MAN) package. Since the Cygwin tools for
Windows (<a href="http://www.cygwin.com" target="_self">www.cygwin.com</a>)
include man pages but not a program to read them, woman is just the
ticket.</p><p>For example, to see the man page for printf, put the cursor
over the word printf in your source code. Enter M-X
<b  >woman</b> and press Return. Emacs will propose
printf as the default manual entry. There are two printf man pages,
one in man 3 and one in man 1. Tell Emacs you want man 3 by
pressing 3 Tab. Emacs will complete the filename, then press
Return. Emacs will show you the man page for printf.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2061580.0x2555110"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Emacs is a fully integrated development environment. While a
front end for external programs, Emacs uses free software for the
back end. In that sense, it is better integrated into Linux than
some proprietary IDEs. There is very little missing from Emacs, but
if something is missing, Emacs is open-source and free software.
