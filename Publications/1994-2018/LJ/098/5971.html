open-source sendmail. While you brought up some great points
regarding its technology and deployment, there were some
inaccuracies that are noted below. The corrections were made by
Sendmail, Inc., the commercial entity that was cofounded by
sendmail author Eric Allman in 1998.
</p><p>Article: 8.11, in fact, was a &ldquo;features&rdquo; release: rather
than being released to patch security holes, it was released
because the sendmail team had added support for TLS encryption and
for the SMTP-AUTH extension to SMTP.</p><p>Correction: SMTP AUTH was released in 8.10, 8.11 adding
support for encryption when using SMTP AUTH.</p><p>Article: The first and probably longest task in setting up an
SMTP gateway is generating /etc/sendmail.cf.</p><p>Correction: The path is /etc/mail/sendmail.cf.</p><p>Article: Below is a mailertable with two different
actions:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
polkatistas.org       smtp:internalmail.polkatistas.org
mail.polkatistas.org  local:postmaster
</pre><p>In addition to delivery rules, sendmail needs to know which
e-mail destinations should be considered synonyms of the local
(SMTP gateway's) hostname. These are specified in
/etc/mail/local-host-names, one per line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mail.polkatistas.org
</pre>


Correction: mail.polkatistas.org should be in the mailertable
<span   class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> local-host-names, not both.
</p><p>Article: Note that this won't work for aliases, which has its
own utility, newaliases. Run newaliases without any flags to
convert your changed /etc/aliases file into a new /etc/aliases.db
file automatically.</p><p>Correction: The path should be /etc/mail/aliases (and
/etc/mail/aliases.db).</p><p>&mdash;Anna Vrechek</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mick replies:</b></span> First, yes,
the official location of aliases, aliases.db and sendmail.cf has
changed from /etc/ to /etc/mail. However, on the Linux
distributions I used for my testing in writing this article (SuSE
7.1 and Red Hat 7.0), the Linux-vendor-provided sendmail packages
installed these files in /etc/, probably for historical reasons
(i.e., many users probably still expect them to be there). My
article intentionally reflected the reality of most of my readers,
even though this differs slightly from the reality of a sendmail
distribution built from the latest source or installed from recent
sendmail installation media from Sendmail, Inc. Second, I did
indeed confuse my feature-add-dates for Sendmail 8.10 vs. 8.11,
proving that reading the same release notes repeatedly late at
night sometimes has the opposite of its intended effect of
clarifying things. Thanks for setting the record straight. Third,
thanks also for clarifying the mailertable vs. local-host-names
redundancy. All I have to say in my defense is that 1) the method I
described does work, even though it's redundant; and 2) sendmail's
documentation (as included in the free version) isn't at all clear
about the relationship between these files, so I do sincerely
appreciate your feedback on this matter.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16f2580.0x17ea768"></a>Hot Article</h2></div></div><p>I'd like to congratulate Greg Kroah-Hartman on his Kernel
Korner article &ldquo;Hot Plug&rdquo; [<i  >LJ</i>, April 2002].
I particularly enjoyed the article since it was written in a way
that mere mortals such as myself (C++/Qt is far more my style than
C, thanks) could understand, whilst still remaining reasonably
technical. It also taught me a lot about hot plug&mdash;I didn't know
anything about it previously. I'd love to see more of this kind of
feature. Thanks for a great magazine!</p><p>&mdash;Chris Howells</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16f2580.0x17ea920"></a>Easier Connection</h2></div></div><p>I just got done reading the April 2002 issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i> and have some comments on Andrew
Trice's article &ldquo;Connect to Microsoft SQL 2000 with the Perl
Sybase Module&rdquo;.</p><p>First, the original version of Microsoft SQL Server was built
on Sybase technology, thus the reason that Sybase connectors can be
utilized.</p><p>Second, there is a much easier way to connect to SQL Server
2000. SQL Server 2000 can connect to IIS via a virtual directory
(and patch, patch, patch!), then a query can be performed by using
an HTTP request such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
http://IISServer/nwind?sql=SELECT+*+
FROM+Customers+FOR+XML+AUTO&amp;root=root
</pre><p>This example connects to the nwind database and does a simple
select; the data is then returned as an XML document with root as
the top-most element. This could then be parsed with Perl in the
standard way.
</p><p>This method doesn't allow access to some of the handy
elements of and ODBC connection, and doesn't allow an easy
mechanism for inserts/updates, although they can be performed with
templates and OpenXML.</p><p>If all you need SQL Server for is running ad hoc queries,
this is a simple solution.</p><p>&mdash;David Scott</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16f2580.0x17eace8"></a>Missing Antiques</h2></div></div><p>The cover of your April 2002 issue has the words &ldquo;Antiquing
Your Desktop&rdquo;. Huh? Wherzat? Admittedly, I only scoured the index
and flipped through each page, not yet having had time to read the
thing cover to cover (okay, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Playboy</em></span> arrived at
the same time). But I have had my interest seriously piqued by what
appears to be a non-existent article. Please, Oh Great Ones, shed
some light!</p><p>&mdash;Andrew Bell</p><p>Andrew, the antiquing your desktop referred to Marcel Gagn&eacute;'s
article &ldquo;Interoperate with Me&rdquo;, where he &ldquo;revisits a few
familiar desktop environments from the past&rdquo;. I apologize if our
sorry little play on words had you looking for something on
furniture restoration. I hope you find Marcel's article equally
interesting.</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16f2580.0x17eaf50"></a>Just an Addict</h2></div></div><p>I'd like to say that I found Robert Adam's article &ldquo;The m4
Macro Package&rdquo; (in the April 2002 issue of
<i  >LJ</i>) to be very interesting and immediately
useful. I read it on the train ride to work and put m4 to good use
that very day! Thanks for keeping me hooked on
<i  >LJ</i> with articles like these.</p><p>&mdash;Fred Daoud</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16f2580.0x17eb160"></a>False Hopes</h2></div></div><p>The article &ldquo;The CodeWeavers CrossOver Plugin&rdquo; in the April
2002 issue was very exciting to read. However, the hope instilled
by the article was false because of one requirement the article
failed to mention: an x86 processor. It was very disappointing to
discover that requirement only after checking the web page.</p><p>I would have thought the writers and editors of
<i  >Linux Journal</i> would have been aware of the
existence of instruction set architectures other than x86. There
are actually quite a number of different hardware architectures on
which Linux runs very well. For my part, I have chosen to use an
architecture superior to x86 out of simple disgust for segment
registers, prefix bytes, the A20M pin, a register model based on
the 8008, etc.</p><p>&mdash;Robert M. Riches Jr.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16f2580.0x17eb370"></a>Erratum</h2></div></div><p>Please note the correction to the web address on page 89 of
