    Readers respond to David's recent topics of interest,
    frustration and spam.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a5b580.0x1b53558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Recently it seems I hit on three very hot
topics (all at once, too), that is if the volume of mail I've
received is any indicator. The first of these topics can be reduced
to library versioning problems on distributions and my need to keep
several kernels of varying levels running to make everything I
wanted to compile and run do so. Guess I'm not the only one.
Perhaps a plea to programmers not to use the latest bleeding-edge
library version would help, and this would be the
<i  >LJ</i> issue for that. So programmers, if you're
listening, how about helping us users out!
</p><p>The second issue that struck home was spam. We've seen the
fall of ORBS followed closely by ORBZ. A number of other blacklists
have sprung up in their place like weeds, but without a track
record, just good intentions. The Razor database is suspect, with
Razor sidelining several mailing-list messages that were obviously
not spam. So lists and databases only work so well. I've looked
over yet another antispam package that seems promising and is
tunable. Let's see how that turns out (see SpamAssassin
below).</p><p>Finally, a lot of folks are eager to dump Windows but can't
seem to replace that Quicken package. Financial packages are dull,
uninteresting and few programmers willingly commit the programming
career equivalent of hara-kiri by writing one of these packages.
But they are needed. One package with some promise has gone from
open- to closed-source. I don't review commercial packages, but
those of you needing a personal financial package might take a look
at MoneyDance on the AppGen site
(<a href="http://www.appgen.com" target="_self">www.appgen.com</a>).</p><p>Mail::SpamAssassin
<a href="http://www.spamassassin.org" target="_self">www.spamassassin.org</a></p><p>I've looked over a very large number of spam filters, and not
one is perfect. It seems some folks have been poisoning the well
where Vipul's Razor database is concerned, so I tried SpamAssassin,
which has a setup similar to Vipul's Razor. One thing about
SpamAssassin, it's easily reconfigured. During my test period, I
had several hundred spam messages identified. I only had one spam
at 4.6 make it through and one friendly message at 5.5 get
sidelined. But SpamAssassin allows you to create white and black
lists. So if you have friends in, say, Costa Rica who use acr.co.cr
in their e-mail addresses, you can whitelist only their specific
address, while the spam kings using acr.co.cr are summarily sent to
/dev/null. Excellent. Requires: Perl, Perl modules Net::DNS,
Mail::Internet, Net::SMTP and procmail.</p><p>xlog
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~pa3aba/xlog.html" target="_self">people.debian.org/~pa3aba/xlog.html</a></p><p>For all you ham operators out there, this is a great logging
tool for your contacts. You can have multiple logs. You can add and
delete bands in Preferences. The date is filled out, and on contact
you just click the Time button and the time is filled in. Fill in
the calling/responding station, add some remarks, select the band
and click Add. You can search the log and more. It has an extremely
user-friendly interface&mdash;heck, even a non-ham could work this log!
And I should know. Requires: libgtk, libgdk, libgmodule, libglib,
libdl, libXext, libX11, libm, glibc.</p><p>Remote Accounts Handler
<a href="http://www.entropika.net/racs" target="_self">www.entropika.net/racs</a></p><p>This particular Bash script goes a little beyond gpasman. Not
only does it store a list of your remote accounts and logins in
GPG-encrypted form, it also allows you to connect to them by
calling Racs with the alias for your remote account as the
argument. It then fires up the application (SSH, Telnet, FTP, SFTP,
HTTP, MySQL) and connects you to the account. Requires: Bash,
expect, dialog (optional), GPG.</p><p>Penetrator
<a href="http://www.triptico.com/software/penetrator.html" target="_self">www.triptico.com/software/penetrator.html</a></p><p>This Perl application will index all your files so you can
perform a word search &agrave; la htDig or another search engine.
But it also works locally on your hard disk and anywhere you have
read privileges. So if, like me, you have years' worth of text-type
documents and would like a word index of them, check out
Penetrator. Its first run may take awhile, but after that, adding
entries are quick and easy. If you take advantage of the optional
SQL capabilities, you can perform SQL searches on the database
without Penetrator's help. Requires: Perl, Perl modules DB_File,
Getopt::Long, DBI::Pg (optional).</p><p>dnotify
<a href="http://www.student.lu.se/~nbi98oli" target="_self">www.student.lu.se/~nbi98oli</a></p><p>This utility sleeps in the background until a directory it is
watching has a file accessed or changed in a predetermined way; it
will then perform the specified command. This utility could be of
particular value as part of an intrusion detection system. Find a
rootkit? Let dnotify send you a message when the directory
containing the file has been accessed. Requires: glibc.</p><p>yesClock
<a href="http://www.germane-software.com/software/yesClock" target="_self">www.germane-software.com/software/yesClock</a></p><p>Here's a different idea in a clock. It will tell you the
time, but also shows you (provided you've set your preferences to
the appropriate lat/long) your relative day/night position. This
one is just for fun. Requires: JVM2.</p><p>Nessus
<a href="http://www.nessus.org" target="_self">www.nessus.org</a></p><p>Three years ago I reviewed Ted, an excellent RTF word
processor, Nessus, a security check program and Nmap, a network
scanner. A tough choice, but I went for Nessus.</p><p>Okay, I cheated a little. Nessus uses Nmap as part of its
routine. Nessus is probably the most complete and powerful security
auditing tool available at any price, and this one's free. If you
use the development release, you'll get a good look at all your
vulnerabilities so you can do something about them. If you are
responsible for network security, this package is a must-have.
Requires: libX11, libXext, libXi, glibc, libdl, libgdk, libglib,
libg mp2, libgtk, libm, libnsl, libresolv.</p><p>Until next month.</p></div></div>
