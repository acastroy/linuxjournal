    Here are a few games that are both addictive and educational
    for those starting to learn programming.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c4e580.0x1d463f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Programmers are like minor deities,
Fran&ccedil;ois. They begin with nothing but an idea and access to
a few random bits and bytes, then
<span   class="emphasis"><em>voil&agrave;</em></span>! Out of the chaos, they create a
new kind of life that takes form on our Linux systems. It is truly
amazing, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>.
</p><p>Yes, of course, Fran&ccedil;ois. You are quite right. It is a
little intimidating as well. Ah, the power. The responsibility. The
sheer pleasure of creating something from nothing. Not just
intimidating, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>, but intoxicating.
Speaking of intoxication, our guests will be here shortly. Tuscany
sounds good tonight. Why don't you run down to the cellar and bring
up the 1997 Vino Nobile di Montepulciano?
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois! They will be here any
moment.</p><p>But they are here already. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bon soir</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>! It is an exceptional pleasure to see
you here again at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, where fine
Linux fare is always on the menu. Please sit. Fran&ccedil;ois is
even now in the cellar bringing up today's wine. Before you
arrived, we were talking about the joys of digital creation,
programming, which you may have noticed is this issue's theme. The
Linux systems you use here in the restaurant and at home are the
product of numerous talented and passionate programmers, all of
whom set out to contribute something to this community. Sometimes
what they create is a kind of cybernetic life, creatures and robots
of various incarnations. If you have ever sat on the sidelines
thinking to yourself that you would also like to join this group of
creators, then tonight's menu is for you. Ah, Fran&ccedil;ois,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>merci</em></span>. Please pour for our guests. Be
generous!</p><p>One way to learn something new is through games, and so it is
with Java. IBM offers something called Robocode, a programming
environment where you can create Java robots that battle it out in
an arena on your screen. Each battle goes through several rounds,
and stats are gathered so that you can see how your favorite robot
is doing. From this information, you can tweak various parameters
and make your robot more efficient. Will stopping and turning every
30 steps instead of every 100 increase your chances of success? The
way to find out is to make the changes, compile, run and watch the
results. This is a great starter for the new Java programmer; it
can also be addictive.</p><p>To get started with Robocode, you will need the Java
developer's kit. You can get a free copy from
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se" target="_self">java.sun.com/j2se</a>;
simply download the package you need. I used the RPM install on my
system, but you also can get a GNU tar shell script for other Linux
distributions. I should probably warn you about that
installation&mdash;the binaries did not get installed in the standard
bin directories. To continue, I had to change my PATH to reflect
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/java/jdk.1.3.1_02/jre/bin
</pre><p>Once you have Java installed, head on over to IBM alphaWorks
for your copy of the Robocode package, located at
<a href="http://robocode.alphaworks.ibm.com/home/home.html" target="_self">robocode.alphaworks.ibm.com/home/home.html</a>.
You'll find the installation process quite painless, as there is
really nothing to compile. Simply run the installation program with
Java using the following command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
java -jar robocode-setup.jar
</pre>


The first thing you'll encounter is a window that asks you to
accept the license agreement. This will be followed by a suggestion
for an installation directory. I accepted the default, a directory
called robocode in my home directory. When the installation
completes, you can start the program with this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd $HOME/robocode
./robocode.sh
</pre>


When you start the program, you'll see the Robocode arena where
robot tanks do battle. Click Battle on the menu and select New. A
card will appear asking you to select robots for the coming battle.
All these are prefixed with &ldquo;sample.&rdquo;, and each has a certain set
of characteristics preprogrammed. For example, start with
sample.MyFirstRobot and sample.Spinbot. Before you go ahead and
click the &ldquo;Start battle&rdquo; button, choose the battlefield tab. For
my 1024 &times; 768 desktop, I chose a nice, unassuming 800 &times;
600 battlefield. Finally, there are some rules to follow, defined
under the rules tab, including the gun cooling rate and inactivity
time. Be aware of these, but for now accept the defaults. Ready?
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Allons</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. Press
Start Battle.
</p><p>You get robots like Sitting Duck, which just sits there and
waits to be blown up. You can also work with Crazy, a robot whose
motion and firing pattern appears mostly random. Each can be loaded
and modified to behave in ways different from the original
programming definitions.</p><p>If, like me, you were not entirely satisfied with the outcome
of this battle, it is time to get coding and modify your robot. The
first time you decide to modify your robot, Robocode will build
Jikes, the compiler (it even tells you to go get a cup of coffee).
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Oui</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, I was
asking the same question myself. How old should a programmer be
before he or she starts on the real java? For a look at the robot
editor and a game in progress, have a look at Figure 1.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5939f1.large.jpg"><img src="5939f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Editing Robots with Robocode
</p></div></div><p>The easiest way to learn is to work with the sample robots,
and then venture out on your own when you feel more comfortable.
When the compiler is ready, you'll be presented with Robocode's
development environment. Click File, Open and then choose
&ldquo;sample&rdquo;. You'll get a new list with all the sample robots (such
as Ramfire). The code for each of these robots is well documented,
so a new programmer can quickly grasp the concepts of what is
happening. For instance, what should your robot do when it hits a
wall:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/**
      * onHitWall:  Handle collision with wall.
      */
     public void onHitWall(HitWallEvent e)
     {
            // Bounce off!
            reverseDirection();
     }
</pre><p>The various methods for the robot class are a snap to catch
on to, ahead(), back(), fire(), fireBullet(), donothing() and so
on. You'll find documentation for the API in your installation
directory under javadoc/index.html.
</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois, if you would be so kind as to refill our
guests' glasses, I have another similar programming environment
that I would like to share with them.</p><p>Andreas Agorander's DroidBattles works on a similar principle
as does Robocode. Instead of using Java as its language, however,
this program works in an assembler-like language. At this low
level, it's as close as you can get to the heart of your software
creation. The program itself is built using the 2.X Qt libraries,
so those of you running KDE 2.X should have no trouble building the
program. But, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, before you build it,
it must first come to you, or rather, you must come to it. The
latest source is available at
<a href="http://www.bluefire.nu/droidbattles/index.html" target="_self">www.bluefire.nu/droidbattles/index.html</a>.</p><p>The strange thing with this installation was that all the
files in the archive were datestamped with a future date, which
gave me a little grief when I got to the
<b  >./configure</b> step. To make things right, I used
the touch command to stamp everything with the current date.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf droidbattles-1.0.4.tar.gz
cd droidbattles-1.0.4
./configure
make
make install
</pre><p>What makes DroidBattles fascinating is that you build the
robot in code as well as in hardware, adding CPUs, memory, engines,
plasma guns and scanners. When you start the program by typing
<b  >droidbattles &amp;</b>, you'll get a control panel
like the one in Figure 2. To do battle, you need to create and
program at least one robot. Pressing the Bot-creator button at the
top of the panel is the first step toward unleashing your
mechanical warrior.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5939f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. DroidBattle's Control Panel
</p></div></div>


</p><p>You'll be presented with a kind of shopping list for your
robot's physical attributes, as well as a window for code. For
those who have never looked at assembler, the code will seem a
little strange but not for long. These instructions are for the CPU
itself&mdash;not the one in your computer but the one onboard your
robot. The instructions aren't complicated, and a complete manual
comes with DroidBattles; just click Documentation on the
panel.</p><p>Incidentally, if you go ahead and add tons of hardware to
your robot, you may be able to assemble it, but the system won't
let you run it. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; you ask. The config editor defines the
parameters we must adhere to when building our robots. For
instance, you define a maximum number of devices or memory, as well
as the cost of these items. Furthermore, a robot has a maximum cost
and each of those devices cost money. (Fear not, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>, this is virtual money.) That cost is determined by
how good a particular device is. Plasma guns cost anywhere from $50
to $3,500. These parameters allow you to mix and match the various
characteristics within a limited framework. Will you stand a better
chance in battle with two plasma guns but only half the processing
power? Make the changes, save your robot and find out.</p><p>Finally, when you are through, click Tests in the Bot-creator
and choose &ldquo;Quick battle&rdquo;. You need to select at least two robots
to have a battle, but they can be the same ones. The battlefield
appears (see Figure 3) and the game is on. Click Play and watch the
fun. As the battle progresses, you can click Pause and then switch
to single-step mode. When running in test mode, note the debug
window that pops up and displays memory locations, registers and
instructions as they are being executed.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5939f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The DroidBattle Battlefield
</p></div></div><p>This is all very geeky and a great deal of fun. You might
also want to watch Andreas' page, as he is in the process of
setting up a DroidBattle server.</p><p>Well, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, I fear that the time has
gone by very quickly today. One of the most difficult aspects to
starting down a road like programming is deciding what it is you
would like to create. Programs like Robocode and DroidBattles set
the stage for you and draw you into a tournament where the code
seems more like play than work.</p><p>Thank you once again, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. Your
visit to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span> is always a pleasure.
Relax. Finish your wine. Enjoy. Until next month. <span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre
sant&eacute;</em></span>! <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bon
