you need to build applications for the Linux desktop when you're
done reading this.</p><p>by Jason Mott</p><p>
There are many toolkits to choose from for building Linux desktop
applications. Some say this is Linux's downfall; others say it is
its greatest feature. I'll stand somewhere in the middle and say
choice is good if you choose what meets your needs. Most graphical
user interfaces (GUIs) on Linux are based on X, a client/server
architecture that allows for networked computers to share GUI
applications. With X, the application is the client that sends its
graphical output to an X server. The X server accepts applications'
output on behalf of its local hardware (or sometimes virtual
hardware, but I won't go there in this article). In most cases, the
X server and the X client are on the same machine, but use the
client/server architecture nonetheless.</p><p>The base-level toolkit for building an X client is called
Xlib. Xlib is much too low-level and difficult to use by itself to
build an application from scratch. As a result, many toolkits have
been built on top of Xlib to make it easier to write GUI
applications for X. Subsequently, when writing GUI applications
using one of the high-level toolkits, you never even know it's a
networked application (that it's sending its graphical output to a
server).</p><p>The two most popular open-source toolkits that layer on top
of Xlib are Qt and GTK+, upon which KDE and GNOME are respectively
built. Motif is another popular toolkit (not open source, but there
is an open-source clone called Lesstif). Figure 1 shows a diagram
of these (and more) and their relationship with one another. The
farther down on the diagram, the lower the level of API it is. I
prefer KDE/Qt for many reasons, but mostly because it's focused on
a good user interface and a clean and well-designed API.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5735f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

(a calculator) to show how quick and easy it can be. To follow
along you'll need some tools&mdash;most importantly, KDevelop. I used
version 2.0.2 running on KDE 2.2.2. When using KDevelop's setup
wizard you'll be told what dependencies you're missing. Visit the
KDevelop web site
(<a href="http://www.kdevelop.org" target="_self">www.kdevelop.org</a>) or
check with your distribution's included software, and get KDevelop
installed. If you have KDE as part of your distribution, then
you'll have KDevelop.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2106580.0x21fea80"></a>KDevelop</h2></div></div><p>Most tutorials on application development try to be
IDE-agnostic. I've decided against this for a few reasons: KDevelop
is free and comes with KDE; KDevelop makes an already easy API even
easier, and KDevelop's wizards help the developer conform to KDE
user-interface standards. For those who don't like to deal with
Makefiles or creating configure files (or even dealing with the
easier automake and autoconf), KDevelop will handle these things
for you. And for geeks who do like to mess around with Makefiles,
KDevelop allows you to tweak them. In fact, your KDevelop
application is ready to be built with the traditional
<b  >./configure</b>, <b  >make</b>,
<b  >make install</b>. In other words, you're free to
break free from KDevelop anytime you want.</p><p>The first time you fire up KDevelop it will run you through a
setup wizard. The most important piece of the wizard is when it
checks for dependencies (Figure 2). Take the time to look through
this output; if there are failures listed, do yourself a favor and
try to find the libraries needed. The easiest way to do this is to
use <a href="http://www.rpmfind.com" target="_self">www.rpmfind.com</a> (if
your distribution is RPM-based). For each library that failed, do a
search for it on the rpmfind web site. From the search results,
select the RPM appropriate for your distribution and install it.
Once you've done that, rerun the KDevelop wizard (type
<b  >kdevelop --setup</b> on the command line or find an
entry in your K menu that says KDevelop Setup). If there are still
missing items, repeat as necessary.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5735f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

arithmetic. The whole thing took about two hours to complete (okay,
three hours, but I wasn't in a hurry). I was going to name it
Kalculator, but there is an obscure application out there that
already uses that name. So I chose Kalculate. I did not use nor
view any code from KDE's stock calculator called KCalc, which has
more mathematical features than mine. I've always felt KDE should
have a basic calculator anyway, so I'd like to see user-friendly
features added to Kalculate rather than more mathematical features.
Therefore, when you're done reading this you can be a part of a
living experiment in open-source development&mdash;come join the team
and add a feature! You'll get special preference if you say this
article sent you
(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/kalculate" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/kalculate</a>).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2106580.0x21ff0b0"></a>The Document-View Model</h2></div></div><p>We are not going start with a new project, but rather with
the power of the Internet; we're going to use Kalculate. To get the
code for Kalculate from the official CVS server, type the following
(assuming you have write permissions, create a directory called
/usr/local/src if you don't already have one):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/src
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.kalculate.sourceforge.net:
/cvsroot/kalculate login
</pre><p>If this command asks for a password, press enter; no password
is needed.
<pre     class="programlisting">
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.kalculate.
sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/kalculate co kalculate
</pre>


Of course, if you want to build this application yourself, you
wouldn't grab the source. But because I'm not going to do a
line-by-line rundown here, it's probably best to get the source and
then use your new knowledge to either add features or build a new
application.
</p><p>The design pattern used here is called the Document-View
model. It starts out with three application-specific classes:
KalculateApp, KalculateDoc and KalculateView. These three classes
would have been created for you if you were freshly starting this
project with KDevelop. For Kalculate, I did not add any additional
classes other than what is provided in the template. I did this on
purpose so that it would be easy to demonstrate the design pattern
and to show just how far along KDevelop starts you. All I had to do
to build a fully functional calculator was to modify three classes,
add a couple of icons and <span   class="emphasis"><em>voil&agrave;</em></span>!</p><p>The basic rundown of Document-View is that the business logic
goes into the document end, and the user-interface stuff goes into
the view end. In theory, there could be several views of the same
document. In the generic sense, a &ldquo;document&rdquo; is one open session
of a &ldquo;thing&rdquo;. Naturally, this is easiest to comprehend with
something like a text editor. In that scenario, the document object
would represent all the behaviors and properties of a text file,
whereas the view object would provide the display and user
interface of the text to the screen. You'll even notice in the
skeleton code that saving, printing, opening and closing routines
are stubbed out for you. Clearly the text editor metaphor is the
basis for this model.</p><p>However, as is the case for Kalculate, this metaphor doesn't
always work. A calculator doesn't really have a file it represents;
it has a certain set of functionality it represents. So although
the KalculateDoc class will provide our business logic, we have no
need for the open, close, save and print functionality. For now, in
the Kalculate code, I commented out the stock code (that KDevelop
provides) that I didn't need instead of deleting it. This way, if
the need arises, we still have the stub.</p><p>What we do need for a calculator, on the business logic side
of things (KalculateDoc), is to be able enter numbers, assign
actions for those numbers and get the resulting number (and of
course, internally it actually needs to perform the actions). On
the user-interface side, we need buttons for entering the numbers
and entering actions, and we need a display of the numbers.
Assuming you put the cvs checkout into /usr/local/src, you'll have
a /usr/local/src/kalculate directory. Type the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/src/kalculate
kdevelop  kalculate.kdevprj &amp;
</pre><p>This will open up the project. KDevelop stores its project
info into a file named after the project with a .kdevprj ending.
Depending on how you have your preferences set up, you should see
something like Figure 3. If you don't see a project tree on the
left side, make sure that View--&gt;Tree Tools Views--&gt;Files is
selected. You will see the project file structure click into the
kalculate directory (yes, this is a kalculate directory under a
kalculate directory, don't clear your eyes). Here are all the
source files. Of particular interest now are the kalculatedoc.cpp
and kalculatedoc.h files. Double click them. These two files are
the core of our calculator&mdash;the KalculateDoc class handles all of
the processing. It's a virtual machine that needs someone to hook
up controls to it. If you view kalculatedoc.h, you'll notice
something very odd about the class declaration&mdash;there's some
seemingly incorrect syntax. This brings us to the world of slots
and signals.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5735f3.large.jpg"><img src="5735f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. KDevelop Project File

subsystem needs to be built that allows components to be notified
when an event occurs. An event could be some type of user
interaction (moving the mouse pointer, pressing the mouse button,
pressing a key, etc.). Events also may be other software components
announcing some condition (e.g., the time, a full filesystem,
etc.). A popular event in GUI applications, and especially
Kalculate, is that a button widget has been pressed. In KDE land,
events are called signals, and the things that handle the events
are called slots. As the developer, you can create signals and
slots, and you can control which slots are connected to which
signals. You can also connect your slots to stock signals (and vice
versa) or connect stock signals to stock slots. By stock I mean
using a KDE or Qt library class that already has slots and/or
signals defined.</p><p>KDE (and thus Qt) gets away with the incorrect syntax because
it uses the standard C++ preprocessor #defines that replace
signals: with protected: and slots and emit with nothing. The extra
syntax is needed by moc (which is run before the preprocessor). The
Meta Object Compiler (moc) is a program that comes with the Qt
library and is run on your QObject header files in order to create
extra methods for your classes that make them usable as a QObject
subclass. All objects that use slots and signals must be a subclass
of QObject, and the class definition must have the Q_OBJECT macro
called (as you can see in the kalculatedoc.h file). The QObject
superclass has a connect method, and that is the method you use to
connect your slots and signals.</p><p>To create signals, declare them under signals: in your class
declaration. For signals, you don't really have to create a
subsequent method. All you have to do is call emit on the signal
name, and any slot that is connected to it will be called; moc
actually creates the signal method for you.</p><p>Slots, on the other hand, do have to be created. You declare
your slots under public slots, or protected slots, and then define
them as normal methods in your .cpp file. You can then connect them
anytime you want. Like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
connect(this, SIGNAL( mySignal() ),
        this, SLOT( mySlot() ) );
</pre><p>Assuming you have defined a signal called mySignal() and a
slot called mySlot() within the same class, the above call to
connect would bind them together so that any time emit mySignal()
is called, mySlot() will get called. If you wanted to connect your
slot to some other signal in some other object, then your first
argument would be the instance of the object, and your second
argument would be the SIGNAL() macro with the name of the signal
inside the parentheses. It's that easy. All the hard stuff
(including running moc on your headers) is done by KDevelop.
</p><p>So (back to our calculator) the KalculateDoc class is a
series of slots. Each slot represents an action one would take on a
calculating machine. The header file declares all the slots as
shown in Listing 1. Again, the only thing that makes these methods
special is that they are under a &ldquo;public slots:&rdquo; label, and thus
moc will create some metadata about them. As slots, you still need
to define the methods as normal (look at kalculatedoc.cpp to see my
definitions of these slots). Signals, on the other hand, you do not
define; moc does that for you.</p><p><a href="5735l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Slots</a></p><p>So now all we need is a GUI that uses this class. Enter
KalculateView (I hope you are actually opening up the source code
and checking it out). The kalculateview.h file defines our class
that provides the GUI. Under &ldquo;protected&rdquo; you'll see that several
layout managers, an LCD display and several buttons are declared. I
did add one file to KDevelop's stock template code; it's called
kalculatesizes.h, and here is what is in it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#ifndef KALCULATE_SIZES_H
#define KALCULATE_SIZES_H
#define BUTTON_WIDTH 35
#define BUTTON_HEIGHT 35
#define LAYOUT_SPACING 4
#define MAX_WIDTH (BUTTON_WIDTH * 5)
        + ((LAYOUT_SPACING *2) * 4)
#define MAX_HEIGHT (BUTTON_HEIGHT * 5)
        + ((LAYOUT_SPACING *2) * 4)
#endif // SIZES_H
</pre><p>Basically, it sets up the size of our calculator. I decided
to go with a calculator that isn't resizable, but I wanted to make
it easy to change the button sizes. So I define the sizes in this
file. All one needs to do is edit this file and recompile to get a
calculator with different-sized buttons (perhaps future versions
could allow for this on the fly, but I'm hesitant for some reason).
</p><p>In KalculateView, constructor (in kalculateview.cpp) is where
this application comes to life. The call to setMaximumSize() is
what makes this not resizable. The size policy helps out too, but
is just a suggestion. I'll take a moment here and explain layout
managers. Basically, every GUI widget has methods to set its
geometry (height, width, relative position, etc.). When an
application is first set up, and when it's subsequently resized, it
wouldn't be very fun if you had to write code that resized or
repositioned it. And on the initial setup, without a layout
manager, all the buttons in this application would have to be
positioned with hard-coded x/y coordinates. That could take hours
of time when you wanted to change the size of the calculator. So,
instead of hard-coding geometry attributes, we register our widgets
with layout managers that follow certain rules, for example, the
QVBoxLayout, which adds widgets in a vertical column. Every time
you put a widget in with the addWidget() method like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
outerLayout-&gt;addWidget(output,1);
</pre><p>it adds the widget just below the previous widget. A
QHBoxLayout would add the widget just to the right of the previous
one. The second argument is what is called the stretch factor.
Basically, the stretch factor decides how much space this widget is
going to take in relation to the other widgets added to this layout
manager. So if they are all 1, then they will all be the same size
(unless factors like setMaximumSize override it). It takes the sum
of all the stretch factors and applies a ratio. So if you had two
widgets, the first with the stretch factor of 1 and the second with
a stretch factor of 2, then the second would be twice as big as the
first.
</p><p>The really cool thing (as exemplified in KalculateView) is
that you can add layout managers to layout managers. This allows
you to create very complex layouts. Go ahead and play around with
the Kalculate code; see what you can create.</p><p>So, to run this application, do the following. Select
Autoconf and Automake from the Build menu. Then select Configure
from the Build menu. When this asks for arguments, type
<b  >--prefix=[<i><tt>your base kde
dir</tt></i>]</b>. This will allow you to install the
application, which is needed if you want the application's icon to
show up. On my machine, which is Mandrake, the base directory for
KDE is /usr. Your distro may differ. Then, select Execute from the
Build menu, and it will compile and run. You should see something
like Figure 4. But the icon in the upper left-hand corner may be
missing until you install it. To install, as root type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/src/kalculate
make install
&lt;center&gt;
</pre><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5735f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
      Figure 4. Kalculate
   </p></div></div><p>I hope I have pointed you in the right direction. I have
barely scratched the surface of all the things you can do with KDE,
but I have shown you how quickly KDevelop allows you to get
started. It handles almost all the back-end work for you and gives
you an application that compiles on the command line without the
presence of KDevelop (this is good for distributing your code).
Feel free to e-mail me if you have any questions, and I encourage
you to join the Kalculate team and add some features.
