    You don't always need the biggest, baddest machine to get
    the job done well&mdash;slim down the numbers.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e2580.0x19da558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Great meals are made in great kitchens,
Fran&ccedil;ois, but what makes a kitchen great is simple. A great
kitchen is a marriage of talent and environment, the chef and his
or her tools. To do wonderful things, one doesn't need the world's
largest kitchen any more than one needs the biggest and fastest
computer when cooking with Linux. Observe, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon
ami</em></span>, this window manager, IceWM. While it is a small
package, it is still quite attractive, flexible and easy to work
with.
</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois, you are not paying attention.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi?</em></span> Ah, welcome, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>, to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, home of fine
Linux cooking. Please, let me show you to your seats while
Fran&ccedil;ois fetches the wine. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite</em></span>,
Fran&ccedil;ois. Slip down into the north wing of the wine cellar
and bring back that 1999 Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon we were,
uhm, submitting to quality control earlier today.</p><p>While we wait for the wine to arrive, let me tantalize you
with some hints from today's menu. It is easy to get carried away
with the idea of a super fast processor (or several), vast amounts
of disk space and virtually endless memory. Unfortunately, that is
not the machine we are all blessed with. In fact, those who might
remember the days of being a poor student certainly will appreciate
that, sometimes, we take what we can get. How, then, does someone
with only modest hardware take advantage of the power of
Linux?</p><p>For starters, we could run a very small system by going to
some Linux distributions on a single floppy and ignoring the
graphical environment entirely, but I would like to avoid doing
that. The idea is to create an attractive desktop with some
friendly graphical tools while living within the constraints of
limited resources.</p><p>Here are some interesting numbers: on my new Red Hat 7.3
workstation, running the KDE 3.0 desktop with a single xterm, the
<span   class="bold"><b>free</b></span> command shows roughly
34,000KB (not counting buffers and cache) of memory in use. This is
after I subtract the base system requirements and without running a
login manager, such as KDM. Granted, a lot of KDE's funky new
features are running, such as fading tool tips, pop-up icons, sound
themes and so on, but that is the default install. GNOME 1.4, again
with a single xterm, comes in closer to 27,000KB. Those KDE and
GNOME numbers present a sharp contrast to what I get when I run
this IceWM&mdash;a mere 7,500KB.</p><p>As you can see, you can make a huge difference right from the
start even when continuing to run a graphical environment. IceWM,
written by Marco Macek and enhanced by Mathias Hasselmann, is a
small, lightweight window manager that is nonetheless feature-rich.
It supports multiple desktops or workspaces, can be used without a
mouse, supports (and comes with several) themes and does a nice job
of mimicking the style of that other OS.</p><p>The latest incarnation of IceWM can be found at
<a href="http://www.icewm.org" target="_self">www.icewm.org</a>. The site
provides precompiled RPMs, but building this little window manager
is easy and follows the classic extract and build five-step
method:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf icewm-1.0.9-2.tar.gz
cd icewm-1.0.9-2
./configure
make
su -c make install
</pre><p>You no doubt will want to customize IceWM to your own
environment and add those little touches that make you feel at
home. The best way to do that is to create a local .icewm directory
(in your home directory), then copy the system-wide configuration
files there. The default installation puts them in
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/icewm.
<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir $HOME/.icewm
cp -r /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/icewm/* $HOME/.icewm
</pre>


<span   class="emphasis"><em>Et voil&agrave;</em></span>! You are ready to run your new
window manager. The easiest way to get started is to create an
.xinitrc file in your home directory. All you really need in that
file is a single line that reads:
<pre     class="programlisting">
exec icewm
</pre>


Now, type <b  >startx</b>, and you are skating on the Ice
window manager (a little joke, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>).
Click the application launcher button in the lower left-hand
corner, start a few programs, and you should have something that
looks like Figure 1.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6169f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. IceWM, a Very Cool Window Manager
</p></div></div>

</p><p>After doing some rather casual mathematics, my running
instance of IceWM (with nothing but an xterm) comes in at around
7,500KB. Not bad, but where else can we do a little trimming? How
about the graphical web browser? It seems lately that web browsers
keep getting bigger and bigger. Granted this is because of their
increasing richness of features, but on less than super fast
hardware, we might be willing to give up a feature or two. Even
Opera, an excellent browser that has gotten a lot of press lately
(in part thanks to its speed and small footprint), still might be a
bit hefty.</p><p>Consider Jorge Arellano Cid's Dillo browser as an alternative
to the larger, flashier, do-it-all browsers of the day. You'll not
only find that its demands on your system are few, but its speedy
rendering of pages is also nice. Have a look at Figure 2 for a
rather snappy shot of Dillo in action.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6169f2.large.jpg"><img src="6169f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Dillo, a Small and Fast Graphical Web
Browser</p></div></div>
</p><p>To get started with Dillo, visit
<a href="http://dillo.cipsga.org.br" target="_self">dillo.cipsga.org.br</a>
and pick up the latest source. Extracting and building it involves
a familiar set of steps:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf dillo-0.6.6.tar.gz
cd dillo-0.6.6
./configure
make
su -c make install
</pre><p>Once the program is built and installed, you start it by
typing <b  >dillo &amp;</b>. After starting Dillo, I
checked my resources yet again and found that the whole running
process took only 848KB of RAM, a rather impressive little number.
</p><p>Arguably, the word processor is the single most important
desktop application in the office. What could we possibly do in
terms of a full-featured, powerful word processor that handles the
ubiquitous MS Word format documents? Keeping something like this
small is a tall order, I agree, but how does the 1,700KB of AbiWord
sound? Compare that with the nearly 12,000KB my system reports upon
firing up OpenOffice Writer. If all you need is a word processor,
and your resources are limited, visit
<a href="http://www.abisource.com" target="_self">www.abisource.com</a>,
where you can get yourself a free copy of this great word
processor.</p><p>A number of prebuilt binaries are available on the site, so
you probably don't have to do much work. For those who prefer
building from source, you'll have a couple of additional steps, but
it is all very simple:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf abiword-1.0.2.tar.gz
cd abiword-1.0.2/abi
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
su -c make install
</pre><p>When you have finished installing AbiWord, you can start it
by typing the command <b  >abiword &amp;</b>. A word of
warning: a common complaint when starting up AbiWord has to do with
fonts. By default, AbiWord's fonts aren't included in your X font
server's list of available fonts. Consequently, AbiWord will
complain on starting up. The program should still run, but you
won't have access to the included fonts. To rectify this complaint,
you can simply add your fonts to your X font server's font path. On
a Red Hat or similar system, the easiest approach is to use the
chkfontpath command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
chkfontpath -a /usr/local/share/AbiSuite/fonts
service xfs restart
</pre>


The path above assumes that you installed AbiWord from source. On
other systems, you may have to edit the /etc/X11/fs/config file and
manually add the font path. Look for the paragraph that begins with
catalogue =:
<pre     class="programlisting">
catalogue = \
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi:unscaled,
</pre>


Notice that each line has a comma at the end of it except for the
last. If you are manually adding the font path to the end of this
list, make sure you add a comma to the now second-to-last line and
remove the comma from the last. Once again, restart the xfs service
and then restart your window manager session.

</p><p>So, we have a tiny but slick window manager, a tiny but slick
web browser and a modest but powerful word processor. What about an
entire office suite? Once again, I can see from the look in your
eyes that you think Chef Marcel has been sampling a little too much
of his own wine.</p><p>Have a look at Siag Office, whose name stands for &ldquo;Scheme in
a grid&rdquo;. Not a very intuitive name for an office suite, I grant
you, but Siag is an office suite you owe to yourself to have a look
at. It is a tightly integrated suite comprised of a word processor
(which the author calls Pathetic Writer), a spreadsheet (Scheme in
a grid), an animation program (Egon) and more. Right up front, I
will tell you that MS Word format is not directly supported. For
some, this may be a showstopper, but for others it is less of a
problem. Because RTF format can be used to exchange documents, this
may be all you need to move documents back and forth.</p><p>You'll need to get and compile the XawM libraries (an
Athena-compatible library), the Mowitz libraries (more widgets) and
finally, Siag Office itself. Trust me, it's easier than it sounds;
all of these packages are available on the main site. Each package
can be compiled with the classic extract-build five-step method.
For instance, with the XawM libraries, you would do this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf XawM-1.5u.tar.gz
cd XawM-1.5u
./configure
make
su -c make install
</pre><p>Once you have made and installed all three packages, you
should be able to start the word processor by typing the command
<b  >pw</b> and the spreadsheet with
<b  >siag</b>.
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6169f4.large.jpg"><img src="6169f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. All This for So Little</p></div></div>
</p><p>We've done this little number comparison a few times now, so
let's have a look at how much Pathetic Writer demands of my system.
Drumroll please. With Pathetic Writer going and a column-length
article loaded, I am using a mere 1,300KB.</p><p>In fact, with IceWM, AbiWord, Pathetic Writer, the Siag
spreadsheet, the Dillo web browser running and an xterm, my memory
usage is still under 32MB! Have a look at Figure 4 for a screenshot
of my lightweight but busy session.</p><p>But, of course, when working with limited resources,
applications are only part of the picture. A default installation
of any major distribution likely will have a number of unneeded
services running. You must ask yourself whether you need to be
running things like sendmail, NFS, the Apache server and so on when
your PC is being used as a workstation. Run a <b  >ps
axfw</b> and decide whether you need all those
services.</p><p>As you can see, you don't need to have the biggest, fastest
and most up-to-date computer to experience the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ultimate</em></span> Linux system. What you need is the
willingness to look beyond the most popular packages of the day and
ask yourself whether you really need all those features. Sometimes
smaller is better. When it comes to wine, however, a nice generous
glass doesn't hurt. That large glass can, however, affect your
performance (consequently taxis will be waiting outside the
restaurant). Drink up. Enjoy. Until next month. <span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre
