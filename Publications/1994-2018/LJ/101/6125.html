    More than saving money, the Software Livre movement offers
    Brazilian states control over their technological destinies.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe24580.0xf1c6b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Rio Grande do Sul (RS), one of 16 states
in the country of Brazil, has been using free software (which they
call <span   class="emphasis"><em>software livre</em></span>) for several years as a
method of meeting their needs for production software in various
areas. By using software livre, RS has been able to cut software
costs. The money they do spend on software stays in the hands of
Brazilian programmers, who buy Brazilian food, live in Brazilian
houses and pay Brazilian taxes. None of the last three points is
lost on the political leaders of RS, and these points are being
learned not only by the other states in Brazil, but a lot of other
countries in South America.
</p><p>One successful project is called SAGU
(<a href="http://sagu.codigoaberto.org.br" target="_self">sagu.codigoaberto.org.br</a>),
a unified open management system used to automate all of the
relationships that exist between the academic, financial and
administrative aspects of a grade school or university. Highly
modular, everything from the entrance exam process to the financial
accounting of overdue library book fees is handled by SAGU. As a
flexible transaction-oriented database system, it allows for many
other functions to be integrated. It can even be integrated with an
external accounting and payroll system. Because a large part of
teaching these days seems to be generating reports for local, state
and federal governments, SAGU has its own reporting tool that
generates PostScript documents on the fly. Originally conceived and
implemented at Univates, a branch of the central university, it is
now spreading throughout the Brazilian school and university
system. And (of course) the whole project is software livre, so
other school systems in other countries can benefit.</p><p>UERGS (Universidade Estadual do Rio Grande do Sul,
<a href="http://www.uergs.rs.gov.br" target="_self">www.uergs.rs.gov.br</a>)
is a project in which software is oriented toward distance
learning. Designed for a distributed university with more than 22
campuses, the UERGS Project helps manage the processes involved
with that type of learning.</p><p>Directo GNU
(<a href="http://www.direto.org.br" target="_self">www.direto.org.br</a>),
a corporate mailing solution based on software livre, is also
underway. By using this e-mailing solution on the state's 60,000
computers, the state of RS will save over $10 million US. Through
the use of local knowledge and expertise in setting it up, they
also will guarantee the technological control of the software by RS
far into the future. This is an important consideration if you are
thinking about buying mission-critical software from outside your
country.</p><p>Speaking of technological control, I was contacted by a
company studying biodiversity in the Brazilian rain forest.
Unfortunately, the software the company (located in Rio de Janeiro)
needed was produced only in the United States, was prohibitively
expensive and was also available only in English. This last point
meant that they had to teach English to everyone who needed to use
the software, at least as much English as was needed to use the
software, read the manuals and so on. By using software livre, they
were able to reduce the cost of the software, have it respond in
Portuguese, tailor it exactly to their needs and keep Brazilian
programmers and scientists paid. Thus, software livre allows a
company that otherwise could not exist in Brazil to thrive and do
good work.</p><p>Likewise, a project called Rede Escolar Livre RS
(<a href="http://www.redeescolarlivre.rs.gov.br" target="_self">www.redeescolarlivre.rs.gov.br</a>)
will be supplying educational software to more than 2,000 of
Brazil's public schools. The savings in individual productivity
tools and network operational systems is estimated to be over $24
million US.</p><p>In the past few years I have noticed how important
geographical information systems (GIS) are to almost everyone in
the world. Most of you are familiar with mapping programs like
MapQuest, MapBlast and others, but the use of GIS software in
planning government and commercial actions is crucial (for more on
this, please see
<a href="http://www.freegis.org" target="_self">www.freegis.org</a>). In
recognition of the need for GIS software to be free, the project
Geoprocessamento Livre (notice the word &ldquo;Livre&rdquo; showing up more
and more in these projects?) is a free GIS project to provide
inexpensive GIS software. This GIS software is being used in many
strategic projects, including those dealing with health and
education.</p><p>The largest bank in RS, if not in all of Brazil, is using
Linux in their new ATM machines. Manufactured by PERTO S.A., the
TPC-2100 has the outline of a distinctive penguin on the CRT screen
before you start your transactions. Go Tux!</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6125f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>Probably the most humanly touching project is headed up by a
person named Pascal and concerns the Landless Rural Workers
Movement of Brazil
(<a href="http://www.mstbrazil.org" target="_self">www.mstbrazil.org</a>).
Brazil was settled by a few very wealthy families who continue to
control the vast majority of land in Brazil today. This land
ownership tends to impoverish many in Brazil by withholding the
right to grow their own food or to otherwise earn a living. A
movement to help these landless workers has formed in Brazil, and
they have sent a couple dozen people trained in proprietary
software to a central location in RS to be retrained as Linux
system administrators. One woman had traveled four days by bus to
get to the training and would now have to travel back the same way.
It was an intensive month-long course that made each student a part
of the fellowship of software livre and the Landless Rural Workers
Movement.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6125f2.large.jpg"><img src="6125f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Rural Workers Movement
</p></div></div><p>As I travel to various countries that I view to be emerging
economies, I see governments realizing that software livre means
more than cheap software. It also means software tailored to their
non-English consumers. It means jobs for their local programmers.
It means industries that can happen inside their own countries, due
to the availability of software that allows these industries to
flourish. It means control over their own destiny. It literally
means software livre.</p></div></div>
