    Among all the techno-toys that make a true geek salivate,
    few are as cool as an atomic clock.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b4580.0x24ac5b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Here is a device that finally provides
what generations of scientists have dreamed about: an ultra-precise
time reference, a timekeeping piece of incredible accuracy. These
are not simple gadgets; some physics experiments, such as the
verification of gravitation theories, require measurement of very
small time intervals.
</p><p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has
a lab in Boulder, Colorado, devoted to running atomic clocks and
providing official US time. In this lab, the NIST-F1 cesium
fountain atomic clock provides a time reference with a precision of
2 &times; 10-15 (two parts per millionth of a billionth) by
counting the vibrations of cesium atoms at about 9GHz. An even
better clock is in the works. It will measure the resonance of a
single mercury ion at about 100,000 times that frequency, and it
will provide a thousand-fold increase in precision.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5657f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Atomic Clock
</p></div></div><p>The sacred duty of true precision-obsessed geeks is now
clear. They simply have to synchronize the real-time clock of their
Linux machine(s) with such an insanely precise clock.</p><p>Of course, you cannot simply go to a computer store and buy
an atomic clock. (Not that I didn't try&mdash;sheesh, the brazen gall of
that sales guy, trying to saddle me with a radium dial alarm
clock.) The next best thing is a radio-synchronized clock, and a
variety of models are available. They can be connected to the
serial port of a PC and provide time signals synchronized on the
NIST clock.</p><p>But why buy hardware when well-designed, free software would
do the trick? The Network Time Protocol (NTP) has been created to
synchronize computers and distribute time references across
networks. An NTP server keeps time as close to the official
reference as possible. Remote NTP clients query these servers and
sync the local real-time clock (RTC) of the machine. This
timekeeping is a complex problem due to the nature of distributed
computing. Propagating packets between machines takes a nonzero,
variable time. Various correction schemes are integrated in NTP to
take variable latency into account.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b4580.0x24ac9d0"></a>Why Chrony?</h2></div></div><p>There are several NTP clients and servers available for
Linux. The simplest way of using NTP would be to fire up a program,
such as xntpd, and point it to an NTP server. However, this program
and most other NTP clients work best when they are connected to the
Internet continuously. Unfortunately, an intermittent connection
through a modem is still the way most homes access the
Internet.</p><p>That's where chrony comes in. Chrony is a program that
explicitly supports intermittent connections. It is comprehensive
but a tad intimidating, so we'll walk through an installation and
configuration for the most common case: a home user with a modem
connection.</p><p>Chrony is composed of chronyc, a text-based client program;
chronyd, an NTP server running as a d&aelig;mon in the background;
and various configuration files. To interact with the chronyd
d&aelig;mon (chronyd), you run the chronyc client and issue
commands.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b4580.0x24acb88"></a>Downloading and Installing</h2></div></div><p>Some Linux distributions include a version of chrony. Chances
are that this version is an older one, e.g., 1.15 or less. In that
case, you can uninstall the chrony package before installing the
new version.</p><p>First, download the chrony tarball from its home page (see
Resources). At the time of this writing, the current version is
1.16.1. It is composed of the 1.16 version completed by a patch to
1.16.1. We extract the source from the tarball and apply the
patch:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -zxvf chrony-1.16.tar.gz # extracts source
cd chrony-1.16  # dir created from tarball
gunzip &lt; ../chrony-1.16-1.16.1-patch.gz | patch -p1
patching file NEWS
patching file configure
patching file rtc_linux.c
patching file version.txt
</pre><p>The program uses a <span   class="bold"><b>configure</b></span>
script, which makes customization a snap. The only option that you
need to specify manually is the installation directory, with the
--prefix option. By default, chrony will install the client chronyc
into /usr/local/bin and the d&aelig;mon chronyd into
/usr/local/sbin. It is the equivalent of:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# In the same chrony-1.16 dir as before
./configure --prefix /usr/local
</pre>


Once you have run <b  >configure</b>, you might want to
clean up the source a tad before running <b  >make</b>.
Why? Because the source comes with a few syntactic gotchas that
make the GCC preprocessor complain. If you run make right away,
you'll end up with plenty of warnings such as:
<pre     class="programlisting">
warning: extra tokens at end of #endif directive
</pre>


Nothing is broken, but it's easy to get it to compile cleanly. Edit
the files regress.h, reports.h and rtc_linux.h. The last line is an
#endif statement followed by a constant name. You need to comment
out that name. For instance, in report.h, change:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#endif GOT_REPORTS_H
</pre>


to:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#endif /* GOT_REPORTS_H */
</pre>


and chrony will compile like a charm.
</p><p>Now, do:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# In the same chrony-1.16 dir as before
make
su root  # You need to be root to install
install
</pre><p>The next step is to make sure that chronyd starts up at boot
time. If your distribution came with an older version of chrony,
then you are all set; just make sure that the newer version was
installed in the same location as the old one. Otherwise, there are
several methods. The simplest is to add a paragraph supplied by the
chrony doc in your /etc/rc.d/rc.local.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b4580.0x24ad108"></a>Stratum Conundrum</h2></div></div><p>Now, it's time to configure chrony. Because you want to sync
your machine's clock on an NTP server, you need to pick one.
Actually, you'll need to pick a few different servers in case one
of them is unreachable. See the URL for the list of NTP servers in
Resources.</p><p>The list separates the NTP servers into several strata. Now,
what's a stratum? We are not talking about a geological layer of
rock here. Think onion rings instead. Stratum 1 is composed of
servers that are directly synced with an atomic clock. Stratum 2 is
a set of NTP servers that are fed timestamps by stratum 1 and so
on. Keep away from stratum 1 unless you run a physics lab or your
private network has hundreds of machines. Stratum 1 machines should
be reserved for distributing time references to secondary servers
or to machines that cannot settle for the few microseconds of
imprecision incurred by using stratum 2. For our purpose, choosing
servers in stratum 2 or even 3 will be perfectly fine.</p><p>Notice that the administrators of some NTP servers require
you to e-mail them if you want to sync with their machine. Please
do so. If a thousand home machines suddenly start requesting
timestamps from a poor university NTP server, the administrators
need to know that it's actually for syncing clocks and not some new
form of flood attack.</p><p>Ideally, you should pick an NTP server that is not too far
away from your machine (IP-wise). This is not always the same as
geographically. A rule of thumb is to check the output of
<span   class="bold"><b>traceroute</b></span>, which lists the
systems traversed by packets between your machine and the
destination. For instance, since I am a New York dweller, I picked
the following machines: ntp.ctr.columbia.edu from Columbia
University, clock.psu.edu from Pennsylvania State University and
ntp0.cornell.edu from Cornell University (send an e-mail to
<a href="mailto:pgp1@cornell.edu">pgp1@cornell.edu</a> if
you use this server).</p><p>Become root and edit your /etc/chrony.conf file to add these
definitions:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
server <span   class="emphasis"><em>ntp.ctr.columbia.edu</em></span> offline
server
server <span   class="emphasis"><em>ntp0.cornell.edu</em></span> offline
</pre><p>Of course, replace these server names with the names of NTP
servers located close to you. Note that the servers are declared
off-line. Most modem-connected machines do not start a connection
at boot. So when chronyd starts up, it should not start querying
servers. Also, note that the chrony doc insists that you should use
the TCP/IP numerical address of the NTP servers to alleviate a
dependency on DNS. Well, the administrators of most NTP servers
want you to use only the DNS-declared names so that they retain the
ability to move the servers around. Besides, your modem connection
hopefully can reach your ISP's DNS, so I recommend that you use the
NTP server names in the chrony.conf file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b4580.0x24ad580"></a>Passwords</h2></div></div><p>The NTP protocol supports packet authentication. After all,
if you run a company, you don't want wrongdoers to set your
machines' clocks to an arbitrary time. Financial records with an
incorrect timestamp can throw your auditors into a loop.</p><p>Chrony supports that authentication with a simple password
scheme. You can define several chrony users identified by a number
and give them different passwords. The relevant statements in the
chrony.conf file are:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
commandkey <span   class="emphasis"><em>9</em></span>
keyfile /etc/chrony.keys
</pre><p>This specifies that this machine uses key number 9 to be read
from the passwords stored in /etc/chrony.keys. The latter contains,
for instance:
<pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="emphasis"><em>9 zack</em></span>
</pre>


Zack is the name of my cat. Before I started using chrony, the
beast was the closest thing to a precise clock I had in the house.
Every morning at 7:30, he meows pathetically until I feed
him&mdash;including weekends. He quickly became very good at ducking
pillows.
</p><p>Also, chrony needs to store the rate at which your machine's
clock deviates, or drifts, from the NTP server time. Specify a
location for the drift file with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
driftfile /etc/chrony.drift
</pre><p>This way, chrony does not have to accumulate measurements and
recalculate the drift every time you start it.
</p><p>You might have several computers in your home. In that case,
it's a good idea to sync their clocks, too. By default, chronyd
acts strictly as an NTP client with respect to the servers you
define in the server statements. But you can set chronyd to act
like a server for your own subnetwork. Just add an allow statement
to your chrony.conf, and specify either some machines or a
subnetwork. For example, my home machines' Ethernet cards have
addresses in the (nonroutable) 192.168 subnet, and the machine
acting as a server has the statement:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
allow 192.168
</pre><p>in its chrony.conf file. This way, other machines in my home
can sync with my server (address 192.198.0.1) by running chronyd
with this simple configuration file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
server <span   class="emphasis"><em>192.198.0.1</em></span>
keyfile /etc/chrony.keys
commandkey <span   class="emphasis"><em>9</em></span>
driftfile /etc/chrony.drift
</pre>


To summarize, the chrony.conf file of your modem-connected machine
is given below. Note: replace the NTP servers in this example with
the ones that you pick in the list of NTP servers (see Resources):
<pre     class="programlisting">
server <span   class="emphasis"><em>ntp.ctr.columbia.edu</em></span> offline
server
server
commandkey <span   class="emphasis"><em>9</em></span>
keyfile /etc/chrony.keys
driftfile /etc/chrony.drift
</pre>

the background (start it if necessary). Remember that the
configuration file specifies (with the offline keyword) that
chronyd should not query the servers without your permission. Start
your modem connection, verify that you are connected to your ISP
and then start the chronyc client. Figure 2 shows a sample
session.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5657f2.large.jpg"><img src="5657f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Sample chronyc Session:</p></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
      Password command&mdash;notice that your password doesn't echo.
    </p></li><li><p>
      The online command tells chronyd to start using the NTP servers.
    </p></li><li><p>
      The source command lists the NTP servers known by chronyd: ^ means a server, * indicates the source to which chronyd is currently synchronized and + indicates other acceptable sources.

    </p></li><li><p>
      Offset measurement from the last sample. First comes the original measurement, then the actual offset between brackets, then the margin of
error.
    </p></li></ol></div><p>The first command you enter in chronyc should be the password
command. Then, order the d&aelig;mon to start talking to the NTP
servers with the online command. List the NTP servers
(<b  >sources -v</b>, which is the verbose form of the
sources command). See the tilde (~) in the second column? It says
that the server cannot be used yet. It's too early; the d&aelig;mon
needs a couple of minutes to accumulate timestamps and make sure
the responses of the NTP servers aren't delirious. By some cosmic
quirk, the difference between my machine's clock and the NTP
timestamps happens to be 42 seconds (all hail Douglas
Adams!).</p><p>Wait a moment and issue another sources command. After a
while, you'll see that one of the servers has been selected by
chronyd (a star appears in the second column) and that the offset
of your machine is decreasing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
^* cudns.cit.cornell.edu
2    6     54  +2999ms[+2999ms] +/- 3653ms
</pre><p>Chrony slowly accelerates or slows your clock to make it
reflect the NTP time. So over the course of a few minutes, by
gradual correction, any offset will disappear.
</p><p>Other useful commands include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>tracking: shows how your system clock is doing,
that is, how fast or slow it is with respect to NTP sources.</p></li><li><p>sourcestats -v: shows what chronyd thinks of the
sources from the measurements it has obtained so far.</p></li><li><p>makestep: immediately sets your system's clock to
the NTP time instead of gradually skewing the clock. This is the
equivalent of setting the time. Some versions of X11 can freeze if
you set the time back brutally.</p></li></ul></div><p>Finally, remember to issue an offline command in chronyc
before you disconnect your modem. Otherwise, chrony will believe
the source it has picked has become unreachable and frantically
will try to pick a new one.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b4580.0x28a6bc0"></a>Automated Sync</h2></div></div><p>As you can guess, chronyc begs for automated operation. You
can easily create two little scripts that will set chrony on-line
and off-line. The on-line script:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#! /bin/sh
# This script is called after connect
/usr/local/bin/chronyc &lt;&lt;EOF
password  <span   class="emphasis"><em>zack</em></span>
online EOF
</pre><p>should be called after the modem connection has been
established, and the off-line script:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#! /bin/sh
# This script is called before disconnect
/usr/local/bin/chronyc &lt;&lt;EOF
password <span   class="emphasis"><em>zack</em></span>
offline
EOF
</pre>


should be called right before you disconnect.
</p><p>If you use a special dialer, check if it has options to allow
post-connect and pre-disconnect commands. I am using the ATT Global
Network dialer, and it allows me to put such scripts in its
/opt/attdial/bin. If you are using the plain vanilla PPP, you can
insert the on-line script in the /etc/ppp/ip-up file and the
off-line script in /etc/ppp/ip-down. Some distributions want you to
leave ip-up and ip-down alone and modify only ip-up.local and
ip-down.local (check to see if these files exist).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b4580.0x28a6ed8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>I found chrony the ideal tool for syncing my machine through
a modem connection that is only up a few hours a week. I'd like to
thank chrony's author, Richard Curnow, who sent me valuable tips
and answered many questions quickly.</p><p><a href="5657s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
