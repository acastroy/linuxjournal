    Make sure software licensors actually own all the copyrights
    they're making you license.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a4580.0x279c5b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>A license serves to allocate risks
between the licensor and the licensee; it is an essential purpose
of license warranty provisions. The BSD license, for example,
contains the following clause:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>This Software is provided by the copyright
holders and contributors &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; and any express or implied
warranties, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties
of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose are
disclaimed. In no event shall the copyright owner or contributors
be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary,
or consequential damages (including, but not limited to,
procurement of substitute goods or services, loss of use, data, or
profits, or business interruption), however caused and on any
theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort
(including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the
use of this software, even if advised of the possibility of such
damage.</p></blockquote></div>

(This clause was originally written in all capital letters to make
sure every licensee reads it. I find all-caps text to be
unreadable, so I rewrote it here in upper/lowercase.)
</p><p>The important thing to notice is all risks under the BSD
license are borne by the licensee. No matter how dreadful the
software, no matter what damage it causes to your computer or your
business, no matter what promises the licensor advertised about the
usability or functionality of the software, the licensee accepts
the software &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; without any warranty.</p><p>All other open-source licenses I've read contain similar
disclaimers. The licensee bears all the risks associated with using
the software and creating derivative works from it.</p><p>I think the above is a fair allocation of risks, except for
one risk that isn't expressly mentioned in the BSD license: the
risk that the licensor isn't authorized to grant the license to the
software in the first place. The BSD license (because of the
&ldquo;including, but not limited to&rdquo; language) excludes this warranty
of non-infringement.</p><p>Without a warranty of non-infringement, if the licensor
doesn't actually own the copyright to the software he or she
licenses or isn't acting under the authority of a license from
someone who does own the copyright, the licensee, not the licensor,
is accepting the risk of a lawsuit for copyright infringement when
he or she accepts the software.</p><p>Here's how I corrected that problem in a new license I'm
writing called the Academic Free License:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to
the Software is owned by the Licensor or is distributed by Licensor
under a valid current license. Except as expressly stated in the
immediately preceding sentence, the Software is provided by the
Licensor, distributors and copyright owners &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo;, without
warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited
to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose and non-infringement. In no event shall the Licensor,
contributors or copyright owners be liable for any claim, damages
or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or
otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the
Software.</p></blockquote></div><p>In the first sentence of that warranty clause, the Academic
Free License allocates the risk of copyright infringement to the
licensor rather than to the licensee. Between the licensor and the
licensee, I'm convinced that the licensor is in a far better
position to know whether he owns the copyright or has the software
under a license that allows him to license it to others. The
licensee, on the other hand, has no information on which to base a
decision whether to accept the risk of copyright infringement. The
Academic Free License, therefore, allocates that risk to the only
party capable of determining the degree of risk.
</p><p>For example, if the licensor knows he wrote the software
himself, he owns the copyright. But if he merely copied the
software from someone else or created the software while working as
an employee of another company, he cannot honestly warrant against
non-infringement.</p><p>Licensees may be unwilling to accept open-source software
without some assurance from the licensor that they are not
infringing. The absence of such assurances may inhibit the
acceptability of open-source software. With a warranty of
non-infringement, like the one I wrote for the Academic Free
License, licensees can rely reasonably on the license language to
protect themselves from accusations that they didn't care about who
actually holds the copyright.</p><p>What would happen if the licensor gave that warranty of
non-infringement but didn't actually own the copyright or didn't
actually have a valid license to distribute the software? Damages
for breach of warranty can be substantial. In appropriate
situations, a licensee can recover for any loss resulting from the
breach, the difference between the value of the software accepted
and the software delivered, and even incidental and consequential
damages.</p><p>I'm interested in your thoughts about whether open-source
licenses should include warranties of non-infringement of
copyright. Please send your comments via e-mail to
