    This article shows you how to create the GUI of a tiny text
    editor without being a C++ guru. In Part II, we'll add
    missing functionality and translate the program into
    languages other than English.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132c580.0x14246b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The days when writing GUI applications
was a matter between you and your favorite text editor struggling
with a compiler and <span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> are long
gone. Even without an integrated development environment (IDE) like
KDevelop, a lot of helper applications promise to make C++ GUI
programming as painless as possible.
</p><p>Whoever expects the KDE-proven Qt toolkit to be a tarball
consisting of one library will be disappointed when fetching more
than 14MB from
<a href="ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/pub/qt/source" target="_self">ftp.trolltech.com/pub/qt/source</a>.
Though Qt was known for its good quality in previous versions, Qt
3.0 had so many bugs that since its first appearance in mid-October
2001, already the fourth maintenance release has come out. It is
expected that more will be following. Therefore, it is strongly
recommended to choose the latest version.</p><p>The qt-x11-free-3.0.x.tar.gz (we used Qt 3.0.4) archive
includes not only the class library and documentation in HTML
format but also several tools that promise to make life easier for
everyone involved in a GUI application project.</p><p>Let's pick the new version of Qt Designer to create the
graphical interface of a simple text editor application. [The
entire code for this editor is available at
<a href="http://www.trish.de/pub/linuxjournal/ljeditor_qt3.0.4" target="_self">www.trish.de/pub/linuxjournal/ljeditor_qt3.0.4</a>.]
With it comes the user-interface compiler, uic, that converts the
Designer's XML output format into C++ code. In Part II of this
article we'll actually write some C++ code with your favorite
editor and fill the GUI framework with life.</p><p>Then, we'll use a new member of the Qt family, Qt Linguist,
to localize the program. Like Qt Designer, this is a GUI
application using an XML format for input and output. To create the
XML list of phrases requiring translation, it ships with a
command-line tool named lupdate. Once they have been translated,
another command-line tool, lrelease, converts the XML into the
binary format required at application runtime.</p><p>Writing Makefiles for Qt applications is not really a trivial
thing. Older versions of Qt did not ship with a helper application,
but Qt vendor Trolltech offered a tool called tmake for separate
download. The Qt 3.0 tarball includes the new qmake utility that
comes in handy to create the Makefile for the project. This again
we leave for Part II of this article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132c580.0x1424a80"></a>Making Plans</h2></div></div><p>With the g++ compiler we have all necessary tools together
and should think about the text editor application itself. What
should it be able to do?</p><p>Obviously we want it to offer the usual tasks: opening a new
editor window, opening a file, saving its contents, saving it with
a different filename, closing the current editor window and
quitting the entire application. Moreover, it should support copy,
cut and paste, undo and redo. We want the program to be able to
switch font characteristics to italic, bold, underlined and any
combination of these. In an About widget, the editor (let's call it
ljedit) should reveal some information about itself.</p><p>Apart from the changing of font characteristics, all tasks
should be available via a File, an Edit or a Help menu. The
italics, bold and underline toggling should be done via a submenu
in the toolbar populated with additional icons for opening and
saving a file, undo, redo, cut, copy and paste.</p><p>Each of these icons should open a balloon help when the user
hesitates over it with the mouse. Apart from the Save As and the
Exit action, all other tasks should be available via keyboard
shortcuts.</p><p>To avoid users losing data unexpectedly, opening and closing
a file as well as exiting the application should be backed by a
user dialog that asks whether the old data should be saved or
discarded, or whether the user wants to stay with the old file.
While most of the above-mentioned tasks can be done with the
Designer, this last bit will have to wait until next issue.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132c580.0x1424ce8"></a>Designing the User Interface</h2></div></div><p>If more than one version of Qt is installed on the system,
the QTDIR variable should first be set to the directory containing
the relevant Qt version. Next, it's time to fire up the Designer
with a <b  >designer &amp;</b> in a shell. In case the
directory $QTDIR/bin has not been included in the search path or
several Qt versions are available, the absolute path must be added
to the command. To start a new project choose New from the File
menu. In the upcoming dialog, click the C++ Project icon and
confirm your choice with the OK button. Now we have the opportunity
to create a new qmake project file by choosing name, location and
adding a project description (Figure 1).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4721f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. First Step: Creating a Project
</p></div></div><p>Next, we choose the New entry from the File menu once again
in order to create the first (and for the purposes of this article
only) GUI widget of our editor. Thus, Main Window is the right
entry to choose from the New File dialog. We're happy with the
default Insert entry that makes it a part of our new
project.</p><p>This opens the Main Window Wizard. With the first
questionnaire (see Figure 2) we feel that yes, Designer should
create menus and the toolbar for us. It should provide us with a
code framework for the functions used and connect these functions
to the relevant actions.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4721f2.large.jpg"><img src="4721f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Creates Menus and Toolbar: the Main Window
Wizard</p></div></div>
</p><p>The Next&gt; button brings us to a setup dialog for the
toolbar. From the File Category, we choose Open and Save and add
them to the Toolbar list using the arrow to the right. Then we
choose the Edit Category and add the Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy and
Paste actions, plus Separators (Figure 3). The last wizard dialog
does not leave any work for us to do; it simply finishes the widget
form. This leaves us with a Designer looking like Figure 4.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4721f3.large.jpg"><img src="4721f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. Filling the Toolbar with
Actions</p></div></div>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4721f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The Designer with a New Main Window
</p></div></div><p>All the new widget is missing in order to look like a proper
editor is a nice name in the window caption (currently reading
Form1) and the text edit canvas. To solve the first task we need to
have a look at the Properties tab in the Property Editor window. It
always fills itself with the characteristics of the current widget
(i.e., the one last clicked on the form); to begin with this is the
form widget.</p><p>By changing the property <span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span> to
&ldquo;ljeditor&rdquo; we define the class name of the widget we're creating.
On the other hand, <span   class="emphasis"><em>caption</em></span> defines the window
caption and should be set to the new application's name,
&ldquo;ljedit&rdquo;.</p><p>Now, let's add the editor canvas. Click on the Richtext
Editor icon (in Figure 4, the fifth icon from the right labeled
&ldquo;abcde&rdquo;), then click on the rastered background of the ljeditor
form, and the new editor canvas can be resized by pulling it in
shape with the blue handler points. Let's baptize it &ldquo;TextEdit&rdquo;
in the Property Editor.</p><p>All we have to do now is adjust functionality. First we
remove the actions we don't want to implement from the Action
Editor (see Figure 5) by clicking on the scissors icon or the
Delete Action entry in the context menu available with a
right-click onto the marked action. In this example, we can do
without helpIndexAction, helpContentsAction, editFindAction and
filePrintAction.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4721f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The Action Editor
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132c580.0x1425aa8"></a>Action!</h2></div></div><p>In return, an editor needs some new actions to change the
font characteristics. In the menu descending from the Action
Editor's Create New Action icon (the little paper sheet on the
left-hand side) we choose New Dropdown Action Group as a container
for them and edit its properties. First, the action group is named
&ldquo;fontCharacter&rdquo; in the name line of the Property Editor. Then we
choose an appropriate icon using the &ldquo;...&rdquo; button next to the
clicked iconSet property. Using the Add... button, it is possible
to add icons stored somewhere in the filesystem.</p><p>Its <span   class="emphasis"><em>text</em></span>, automatically used for the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>menuText</em></span> and the various tips (see Glossary),
should read &ldquo;Font Characteristics&rdquo;. We change the tooltip and the
statustip to &ldquo;Choose font characteristics&rdquo;, and most importantly,
we set the exclusive property to False. This means that the user
will be able to combine italics, bold and underlined font if
needed. An exclusive action group would allow for only one of them
at a time.</p><p><a href="4721s1.html" target="_self">Glossary</a></p><p>With a right-click on the fontCharacter action group in the
Action Editor and subsequent decision for New Action in the context
menu, we add the italics action with Ctrl-I as accelerator key and
Italics as text. Because the user can toggle italics on and off, it
is important that the property toggleAction reads True. To begin
with, italics should be off; therefore, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>on</em></span>
property must have the value False.</p><p>We define the other two child actions of fontCharacter the
same way, bold (Ctrl-B) and underline (Ctrl-U).</p><p>To add the entire fontCharacter action group to the toolbar,
we simply drag it from the Action Editor to the form and drop it
onto the toolbar. A right-click into the toolbar allows us to add a
separator (Insert Separator).</p><p>By now, these actions don't do anything when playing with the
preview available by pressing Ctrl-T. To let them actually do what
they promise, we once again mark the italics action in the Action
Editor, click on the red-blue Edit Connections icon and choose the
toggled(bool) signal from the Signals list. Instead of connecting
it to an ljeditor slot, we choose TextEdit in the Slots drop-down
menu and subsequently setItalic(bool) in the list of slots provided
by the QTextEdit class of which TextEdit is a member. No additional
click is needed; with the appearance of the connection in the
Connections: window, everything is done (see Figure 6), and the OK
button is our friend.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4721f6.large.jpg"><img src="4721f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 6. When the italics action is toggled, ljedit
writes italics or stops doing so.</p></div></div>
</p><p>Then we repeat the same procedure with the bold action's
toggled(bool) signal and TextEdit's setBold(bool) slot. We connect
the underline action to TextEdit's setUnderline(bool) slot. After
this the preview reacts to Ctrl-I, Ctrl-B and Ctrl-U as
wanted.</p><p>This encourages us to edit the connections of the predefined
actions; these can't be toggled. Instead, they launch a user
command like &ldquo;save current data&rdquo; when activated (i.e., clicked or
chosen). That's why we connect the activated() signal to the
appropriate slot.</p><p>For editRedoAction this is TextEdit::redo(). We disconnect
the connection with the default ljeditor::editRedo(); it would be
the right choice if we didn't want to rely on QTextEdit's redo()
function. The same way, editUndoAction's activated() signal is
connected with TextEdit::undo() and disconnected from the
respective ljeditor function skeleton. We repeat this step with
editPasteAction and the TextEdit::paste() slot editCopyAction and
the TextEdit::copy() slot, and editCutAction and the
TextEdit::cut() slot.</p><p>The remaining predefined actions (helpAboutAction,
fileExitAction, fileSaveAction, fileSaveAsAction, fileOpenAction
and fileNewAction) stay connected with the predefined ljeditor slot
skeletons that we later have to fill with code.</p><p>One action is still missing: the one that the user activates
to close the current editor window (as opposed to fileExitAction,
which quits the entire application).</p><p>The work flow is a familiar one: we choose New Action from
the Action Editor's Create new Action menu. The new action is named
&ldquo;fileCloseAction&rdquo; in the Property Editor and is equipped with
Close as text and Ctrl-Z as the keyboard accelerator.</p><p>However, we're missing a slot to connect its activated()
signal. We fix this by opening the Slots... menu item in the
Designer's Edit menu. Figure 7 shows the dialog that is opened
now.</p><p>We add a slot with the function name fileClose(), the Return
Type void and the Access type public. The Edit Slots dialog does no
magic, it simply creates a function skeleton in the class
definition of the ljeditor class.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4721f7.large.jpg"><img src="4721f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 7. A new function skeleton comes into
being.</p></div></div>
</p><p>Now we can connect the fileCloseAction's activated() signal
to ljeditor::fileClose() in the Edit Connections dialog provided by
the Action Editor. As this action should be available via menu
only, we simply drag and drop it into the File menu of the ljeditor
form.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132c580.0x141cee8"></a>Adding Some Code</h2></div></div><p>Closing a widget in Qt is easy: every Qt widget inherits a
close() function from the mother of all Qt widgets, QWidget. This
is not really much code, so it would be nice if we could fill the
fileClose() slot with this one line.</p><p>A right-mouse click on the ljeditor form opens a context
menu. The choice of its Source... entry does the trick. A code
editor window appears and allows us to fill in the one-liner (see
Figure 8):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
void ljeditor::fileClose()
{
     close();
}
</pre><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4721f8.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Simple code lines are easily added to the slot skeleton.
</p></div></div><p>So why not fill the fileExit() slot as well? To quit the
entire application, the application object's closeAllWindows()
function is called:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
void ljeditor::fileExit()
{
     qApp-&gt;closeAllWindows();
}
</pre><p>As the Designer usually does not deal with QApplication
objects itself, qapplication.h (which provides the qApp proxy for
the real application object) is not included by default, and the
code generated from the ui description would not compile.
</p><p>Fortunately, the Object Explorer allows us to include
additional header files. By default it shows the Widgets tab (see
Figure 4, bottom left), but we need the Source tab right now.
Right-clicking the empty Includes (in Implementation) folder allows
us to add a header file (New). Don't forget the &lt;&gt; brackets
around a global include like &lt;qapplication.h&gt; (Figure
9).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4721f9.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. The Object Explorer allows one to include additional
header files.
</p></div></div><p>Another slot we can fill with life without being afraid of
getting too many compilation errors is helpAbout(). It is called
when the user opens the About... entry in ljeditor's Help menu and
simply pops up a message box with the caption About ljedit and some
information about the program. By surrounding all text strings with
tr() we make sure that the program can be localized painlessly, a
task we will fulfill in Part II. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
void ljeditor::helpAbout()
{
    QMessageBox::about( this, tr( "About ljedit" ),
        tr( "A tiny text editor.\n"
        "(C) 2002 Patricia Jung for <i  >Linux Journal</i>\n"
        "Using Qt 3.0.4 and Qt Designer." ) );
}
</pre><p>To be able to use QMessageBox::about(), we have to include
&lt;qmessagebox.h&gt; the same way we did with
&lt;qapplication.h&gt;. We add the remaining functionality in a
subclass next time. Thus, all we have left to do with the Designer
is clean up the new GUI.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132c580.0x141d6d0"></a>Important Cosmetics</h2></div></div><p>Before we leave the Designer for good, we check that none of
the assigned keyboard shortcuts has been used twice. This is done
by choosing Check Accelerators from the Edit menu.</p><p>Additionally, we clean up all the ljeditor slots that we
weren't going to implement anyway or that we used TextEdit slots
for instead. By choosing Slots from the Edit menu (one way to do
it), we open the dialog that allows us to mark editUndo() and
remove it with a mouse click on Delete Slots (Figure 7). The same
fate applies to editRedo(), editCut(), editCopy(), editPaste(),
editFind(), helpIndex(), helpContents() and filePrint().</p><p>Furthermore, we check the GUI preview for separators that
don't fit. As we decided against using the editFindAction, a single
separator can be found at the end of ljeditor's Edit menu: once
upon a time there was a Find entry below. To erase the separator,
right-click on it in the form and choose Delete Item. The same
applies to one of the two separators above the Exit entry in the
file menu.</p><p>All GUI elements are in their place&mdash;time to let Qt adjust
the widget proportions. Once again, we choose the entire form and
select Lay Out Vertically from Layout in the main menu. If a user
adjusts the application window size now, the TextEdit widget will
follow. If we wish to place widget elements differently onto the
form, we need to break the layout first.</p><p>Last but not least, we want this GUI to be stamped as ours.
To do this we fill in the Author name and a description in the
dialog raised by choosing Form Settings from the Edit menu (see
Figure 10). Here it is possible to decide whether we want to store
the icons in a subdirectory of our project directory or whether we
include them directly in the user-interface description.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4721f10.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. Let the world know who designed this GUI.
</p></div></div><p>A final selection of Save all from the File menu and an XML
file with the user-interface description (best named after the
relevant class, e.g., ljeditor.ui) along with ljeditor.ui.h, the
file storing the code we typed into the code editor, becomes part
of the project.</p></div></div>
