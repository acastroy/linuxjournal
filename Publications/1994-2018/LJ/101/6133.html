    IMDSes are especially useful for embedded development, where
    every saved process shrinks the footprint and the bottom
    line.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b08580.0x1c005b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Growth in intelligent connected devices
is soaring. Whether in the home, the pocket or built into
industrial communications and transportation systems, such gear has
evolved to include powerful CPUs and sophisticated embedded systems
software. One type of software increasingly seen within such
devices is the database management system (DBMS). While familiar on
desktops and servers, databases are a recent arrival to embedded
systems. Like any organism dropped into a new environment,
databases must evolve. A new type of DBMS, the in-memory database
system (IMDS), represents the latest step in DBMSes' adaptation to
embedded systems.
</p><p>Why are embedded systems developers turning to databases?
Market competition requires that devices like set-top boxes,
network switches and consumer electronics become &ldquo;smarter&rdquo;. To
support expanding feature sets, applications generally must manage
larger volumes of more complex data. As a result, many device
developers find they are outgrowing self-developed data management
solutions, which can be especially difficult to maintain and extend
as application requirements increase.</p><p>In addition, the trend toward standard, commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) embedded operating systems&mdash;and away from a
fragmented environment of many proprietary systems&mdash;promotes the
availability of databases. The emergence of a widely used OS such
as embedded Linux creates a user community, which in turn spurs
development (both commercially and noncommercially) of databases
and other tools to enhance the platform.</p><p>So device developers are turning to commercial databases, but
existing embedded DBMS software has not provided the ideal fit.
Embedded databases emerged well over a decade ago to support
business systems, with features including complex caching logic and
abnormal termination recovery. But on a device, within a set-top
box or next-generation fax machine, for example, these abilities
are often unnecessary and cause the application to exceed available
memory and CPU resources.</p><p>In addition, traditional databases are built to store data on
disk. Disk I/O, as a mechanical process, is tremendously expensive
in terms of performance. This often makes traditional databases too
slow for embedded systems that require real-time
performance.</p><p>In-memory databases have emerged specifically to meet the
performance needs and resource availability in embedded systems. As
the name implies, IMDSes reside entirely in memory&mdash;they never go
to disk.</p><p>So is an IMDS simply a traditional database that's been
loaded into memory? That's a fair question because disk I/O
elimination is the best-known aspect of this new technology. The
capability to create a RAM disk, a filesystem in memory, is built
into Linux. Wouldn't deploying a well-known database system, such
as MySQL or even Oracle, on such a disk provide the same
benefits?</p><p>In fact, IMDSes are considerably different beasts from their
embedded DBMS cousins. Compared to traditional databases, IMDSes
are less complex. Beyond the elimination of disk I/O, in-memory
database systems have fewer moving parts or interacting processes.
This leads to greater frugality in RAM and CPU use and faster
overall responsiveness than can be achieved by deploying a
traditional DBMS in memory. An understanding of what's been
designed out of, or significantly modified in, IMDSes is important
in deciding whether such a technology suits a given project. Three
key differences are described below.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b08580.0x1c00920"></a>Caching</h2></div></div><p>Due to the performance drain caused by physical disk access,
virtually all traditional DBMS software incorporates caching to
keep the most recently used portions of the database in memory.
Caching logic includes cache synchronization, which makes sure that
an image of a database page in cache is consistent with the
physical database page on disk. Cache lookup also is included,
which determines if data requested by the application is in cache;
if not, the page is retrieved and added to the cache for future
reference.</p><p>These processes play out regardless of whether a disk-based
DBMS is deployed in memory, such as on a RAM disk. By eliminating
caching, IMDS databases remove a significant source of complexity
and performance overhead, and in the process slim down the RAM and
CPU requirements of the IMDS.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b08580.0x1c00a80"></a>Data-Transfer Overhead</h2></div></div><p>Consider the handoffs required for an application to read a
piece of data from a traditional disk-based database, modify it and
write that piece of data back to the database. The process is
illustrated in Figure 1.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The application requests the data item from the
database runtime through the database API.</p></li><li><p>The database runtime instructs the filesystem to
retrieve the data from the physical media.</p></li><li><p>The filesystem makes a copy of the data for its
cache and passes another copy to the database.</p></li><li><p>The database keeps one copy in its cache and passes
another copy to the application.</p></li><li><p>The application modifies its copy and passes it
back to the database through the database API.</p></li><li><p>The database runtime copies the modified data item
back to database cache.</p></li><li><p>The copy in the database cache is eventually
written to the filesystem, where it is updated in the filesystem
cache.</p></li><li><p>Finally, the data is written back to the physical
media.</p></li></ol></div><p>These steps cannot be turned off in a traditional database,
even when processing takes place entirely within memory. And this
simplified scenario doesn't account for the additional copies and
transfers required for transaction logging!
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6133f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Data flow in a traditional DBMS. Red lines represent data
transfer. Gray lines represent message path.
</p></div></div>

</p><p>In contrast, an in-memory database system entails little or
no data transfer. The application may make copies of the data in
local program variables, but it is not required. Instead, the IMDS
gives the application a pointer that refers directly to the data
item in the database, enabling the application to work with the
data directly. The data is still protected because the pointer is
used only through the database API, which insures that it is used
properly. Elimination of multiple data transfers streamlines
processing. Cutting multiple data copies reduces memory
consumption, and the simplicity of this design makes for greater
reliability.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b08580.0x1c013c8"></a>Transaction Processing</h2></div></div><p>In the event of a catastrophic failure, such as loss of
power, a disk-based database recovers by committing complete
transactions or rolling back partial transactions from log files
when the system restarts. Disk-based databases are hard-wired to
keep transaction logs, to flush transaction log files and to cache
to disk after transactions are committed.</p><p>Main memory databases also provide transactional integrity.
To do this, the IMDS maintains a before image of the objects that
are updated or deleted and a list of database pages added during a
transaction. When the application commits the transaction, the
memory for before images and page references returns to the memory
pool (a fast and efficient process). If an in-memory database must
abort a transaction (for example, if the inbound data stream is
interrupted), the before images are restored to the database and
the newly inserted pages are returned to the memory.</p><p>In the event of catastrophic failure, the in-memory database
image is lost. This is a major difference from disk-based
databases. If the system is turned off, the IMDS is reprovisioned
upon restart. Consequently, there is no reason to keep transaction
log files, and another complex, memory-intensive task is eliminated
from the IMDS.</p><p>This functionality may not suit every application, but in the
embedded systems arena, examples abound of applications with data
stores that can be easily replenished in real time. These include a
program guide application in a set-top box that downloads from a
satellite or cable head-end, a wireless access point provisioned by
a server upstream or an IP routing table that is repopulated as
protocols discover network topology. Developers of such systems
gladly limit the scope of transaction processing in exchange for
superior performance and a smaller footprint.</p><p>This does not preclude the use of saved local data. With an
IMDS, the application can open a stream (a socket, pipe or a file
pointer) and instruct the database runtime to read or write a
database image from or to the stream. This feature could be used to
create and maintain boot-stage data, i.e., an initial starting
point for the database. The other end of the stream can be a pipe
to another process or a filesystem pointer (any filesystem, whether
it's magnetic, optical or Flash).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b08580.0x1c01630"></a>Application Scenario: IP Routers</h2></div></div><p>Where and how can IMDS technology make a difference? While
in-memory databases have cropped up in various application
settings, the following scenario, involving embedded software in
the most common internet infrastructure device&mdash;the IP router,
offers an idea of the problems this technology can address.</p><p>Modern IP routers incorporate routing table management (RTM)
software that accomplishes the core task of determining the next
hop for data packets on the Internet and other networks. Routing
protocols continuously monitor available routes and the status of
other routing devices, then update the device's routing table with
current data.</p><p>These routing tables typically exist as proprietary
outgrowths of the RTM software. This solution is one of the
principal challenges in developing next-generation routers. As
device functionality increases, routing table management presents a
significant programming bottleneck. Lacking support for the complex
data types and multiple access methods that are hallmarks of
databases, self-developed routing table management (RTM) structures
provide a limited toolset.</p><p>In addition, like any data management solution that is
hard-wired to the application it supports, routing tables encounter
difficulties in extensibility and reliability. Changes made to the
data management code reverberate through the entire RTM structure,
causing unwanted surprises and adding to QA cycles. Scalability is
also an issue: self-developed data management that works well for a
given task often stumbles when the intensity of use is ratcheted
up. The result is that while the Internet's growth requires rapid
advances in routing technology, this device evolution is slowed by
software architecture that has outlived its usefulness.</p><p>Under such conditions, using a database would seem to be a
no-brainer. But deploying a traditional DBMS within an IP router is
problematic. Real-time internet address lookups won't accommodate
the latency required to go to disk and perform the caching,
transaction logging and other processes that are part and parcel of
disk-based DBMSes.</p><p>In addition, imposing a large database footprint within the
router necessitates more RAM and a more powerful CPU. This adds to
the overall device cost, and the market for routers is
price-competitive. Even a slightly lower per-unit price increases
the manufacturer's market share, and a lower per-unit cost drops
right to the bottom line. Software that saves RAM, or requires a
less expensive processor, can determine product success.</p><p>The emergence of in-memory databases allows the application
of DBMS technology to many embedded systems. For developers of
embedded systems, proven database technology provides benefits
including optimized access methods and data layout, standard and
simplified navigation methods, built-in concurrency and data
integrity mechanisms, and improved flexibility and fault tolerance.
Adoption of this new breed of DBMS simplifies embedded system
development while addressing growing software complexity and
ensuring high availability and reliability.</p></div></div>
