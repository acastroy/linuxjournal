web articles that coincides with the new Embedded section that
debuted in the August 2002 issue. The first article to post in this
new web category is Guylhem Aznar's &ldquo;Applications for the Sharp
Zaurus&rdquo;, which offers an extensive discussion about installing
software on the Zaurus PDA. Guylhem also explains how you can sync
data, flash the ROM and get on the Internet. For the full story, go
to

people believing DVD playback applications for Linux were
nonexistent, in &ldquo;GNU/Linux DVD Player Review&rdquo;, Jonathan Kent
provides an overview of four applications for this purpose: Xine,
VideoLAN Client, MPlayer and Ogle. In addition to DVD playback,
some encrypted and some not, several of these applications are
extendable to much more than DVD formats; a few plugins or
downloaded libraries can get you far. Learn how at
<a href="../000/5644.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/5644</a>.</p><p>On a more old-school note, Jim Hatridge undertook the project
of adding his wife's &ldquo;new&rdquo; Compaq DeskPro 386/25e (to be fair, it
is <span   class="emphasis"><em>new</em></span> compared to the 1987 XT it replaced) to
their home network. The challenges were numerous&mdash;she runs MS-DOS
5.0, but wanted only open-source software used&mdash;but using XFS and
pcnfsd, some batch files and Samba, Jim was able to set up his
machine as a fileserver to her machine. Then it was on to the next
challenge&mdash;getting the 386 on the Internet. To see how that turned
out and how you could set up something similar, go to

to gauge how readers will respond. Therein lies the beauty of the
Comments section, where readers can post their opinions about the
article's topic, debate some detail, point out something that was
overlooked (or wrong) and add their own experiences. We were a bit
surprised to see how Paul Barry's article &ldquo;Perceptions of the
Linux OS among Undergraduate System Administrators&rdquo; took off with
comments. Maybe we all felt a little dismayed that the next
generation of programmers and system administrators were recycling
the same &ldquo;Linux is too hard to install&rdquo; recitations. Take a look
at what readers' responses were at
<a href="../000/5650.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/5650</a>.</p><p>We get a lot of submissions for <i  >Linux Journal</i>, and due to space limitations in print, many
helpful tutorials, reviews and news items appear on the web site
instead. Articles are available on the site dating back to 1994,
and new ones are posted every day.</p></div></div>
