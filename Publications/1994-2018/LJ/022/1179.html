    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2279580.0x2371500"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Caldera Network Desktop is an
operating environment based on the Linux operating system and
bundled with commercial software that is licensed and/or developed
by Caldera, Inc. It provides an interface and value-added features
that could help Linux reach a wider market. In addition to the
important features offered by the Network Desktop, Caldera has
announced they will be offering additional products for Linux,
including a version of WordPerfect 6.0 native to Linux and priced
competitively with Windows applications. For these reasons, the
Network Desktop is an important product for the Linux community,
and it deserves some attention.
</p><p>The Network Desktop offers an installation and software
management system that makes it easier to manage and install for
end users and system administrators. The package management system,
which is Red Hat Software's <span   class="bold"><b>RPM</b></span>,
is superior to any software management system I've ever seen on any
commercial Unix or DOS/Windows environment. It also provides a
network backup utility with a graphical interface, automation
capabilities, a distributed database and compatibility with other
versions of UNIX running the same tool. Caldera also bundles in a
font server that further simplifies managing enterprise networks
and supports font formats normally not available with Linux.</p><p>For greater interoperability, Caldera has licensed Netware
4.x client code directly from Novell. They have developed a netware
automounter and a full access to Netware 4.x directory
services.</p><p>Caldera also includes precompiled and configured internet
tools such as a web browser, web server, configurable FTP server
and an important TCP security tool.</p><p>And, of course, Caldera also provides the desktop shell
featured prominently in their advertisements.</p><p>I installed the Network Desktop Preview II on a 90MHz Pentium
system with 24MB of RAM and two 525MB IDE hard drives. The Preview
II release is based on Red Hat Commercial Linux Release 2.x, which
includes Linux kernel version 1.2.13, XFree86 version 3.1.2, and
gcc version 2.7.0.</p><p>Caldera's (and to be fair, Red Hat's) installation procedure
is definitely one of this product's strong points. Installing the
Network Desktop is arguably easier than installing Windows 95 or
OS/2. This is because of two important features: Caldera's
documentation and Red Hat's installation program and package
management tools.</p><p>One way Linux can reach a wider market is by becoming more
accessible to the &ldquo;average&rdquo; user. While many of us long-time
Linux users consider the discovery process involved with getting a
new CDROM or downloading new software from the Net part of the fun,
many users who would love to learn more about UNIX and computing
don't have the time, skill, or patience that is sometimes necessary
to build and maintain their first Linux system.</p><p>The Network Desktop installation procedure addresses this
issue beautifully. Since I've never had a Red Hat Linux CD (a
circumstance that I do plan on changing), I don't know where Red
Hat's installation ends and Caldera's modifications begin.
Regardless, the final product is a pleasure.</p><p>Caldera's <span   class="bold"><b>Getting Started</b></span>
guide has eight pages on how to install the Network Desktop on a
PC. After covering the hardware requirements, the chapter gets at
the information necessary to continue the installation by asking
the installer a series of questions about his target PC. Installers
are instructed to record their answers; these responses constitute
the information regarding network configuration necessary to
successfully complete the process.</p><p>Following this section is an excellent discussion about
memory requirements, booting multiple operating systems, and
several other topics new users need to be familiar with. After
covering this information, the installer must choose the
appropriate kernel.</p><p>The manual contains a few charts and a table that find the
right image based on the network card, SCSI adaptor and CDROM;
these are especially useful to someone installing Linux for the
first time. The installer is led through the process of creating 4
floppies for building the system. This is a process common to just
about every recent Linux distribution.</p><p>For people upgrading from an earlier release of Linux,
Caldera offers something very convenient. The CDROM contains a set
of PERL scripts that prompt the installer for the information
necessary to select a kernel. The scripts save the XF86Config file
and mouse device link (for X-Windows), the fstab (for file systems)
and the workstation IP address. If there is no Ethernet card, the
script warns the upgrader that PPP/SLIP configuration information
will not be saved. The scripts then create the floppies.</p><p>The process of booting from the floppies and preparing for
the transfer of the software from CD is pretty routine. The
partitioning process is smooth and well-documented, and as I said
earlier, Caldera does a fantastic job of explaining the process of
booting multiple operating systems.</p><p>I did find one possible problem for some users later in the
install. I do not have an Ethernet card in my system, and since I
only use PPP for networking, I doubt I am in the minority.</p><p>The network configuration portion of the installation prompts
the user for the necessary information, saves the information to
the system configuration files, and attempts to configure the first
Ethernet interface. If there is no interface, the procedure
displays an error. To the user, the failure indication looks like
the entire network configuration process has been aborted, when in
fact the only error is that the interface could not be set
up.</p><p>There is no option to skip configuring the Ethernet interface
while still entering the other network information such as the host
and domain name. In addition, the boot scripts attempt to configure
the nonexistent interface during every restart. Since the installer
is given the choice of selecting a kernel image with no Ethernet
drivers, this doesn't make sense. There is also no way to skip
configuring networking completely and still come out of the process
with a hostname.</p><p>Since the Network Desktop ships with so many Internet tools,
and since Caldera also provides the bulk of their support and
documentation over the Net (more on that later), I expect that many
users will want to use it to dial into the Internet via PPP and
SLIP. Automated configuration tools for
<span   class="bold"><b>dip</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> would be a welcome
addition.</p><p>After entering the configuration parameters and selecting the
disk partitions, the user can either choose the express
installation or opt to install each package separately. To select
the packages individually, the installer uses
<span   class="bold"><b>glint</b></span>, the Red Hat package tool,
which I will cover later.</p><p>When the software installation is done, the install program
will configure X-Windows (if the user doing a first-time install
rather than an upgrade) and also configure LILO. I was quite
impressed with the X-Windows automatic configuration.</p><p>In addition to the thorough installation instructions and
explanation of basic concepts. Caldera's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Getting
Started</em></span> guide provides a wealth of information for new
as well as experienced users. The introductory chapters also cover
the GNU General Public License (GPL), which components of the
Desktop are redistributable, what conditions they can be
redistributed under, and which components are copyrighted. The full
text of the GPL and other licenses are included in one of the
appendices.</p><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started</em></span> guide also explains
how to get support for the Desktop. Another of the unique features
of Caldera's Network Desktop is that Caldera plans on taking full
advantage of the Internet as a primary mechanism for supporting
clients. The ntroduction lists all of the necessary e-mail
addresses and information about Caldera's Web site.</p><p>In the appendices, Caldera covers the Linux File System
Standard (FSSTND), explains how their product deviates from it, and
gives a representation of the kernel source tree. They also cover
what users and groups are created, and how Red Hat Linux uses the
System V init scripts to start and shutdown subsystems.</p><p>In addition to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started</em></span>
guide, Caldera supplies a large amount of documentation in HTML.
This information is tied together with a Caldera_Info page that
appears as an icon on the desktop. There are also links to Caldera
Web Server. I really can't stress the value of Caldera's and Red
Hat's documentation enough. The information available to a user of
the Network Desktop is broad and abundant.</p><p>The Desktop Application itself is a File Manager/Finder like
shell for X-Windows. However, it doesn't just act as a &ldquo;launching
pad&rdquo; for existing programs; Caldera provides utilities for adding
and removing users, setting the system time, and managing
file-systems as well. A screen capture of the User Configuration
tool screens is shown in <a href="1179f1a.html" target="_self">Figure
1</a>. The tools make tasks such as adding printers and
filesystems much easier. The most important, however, is the
package maintenance tool,
<span   class="bold"><b>glint</b></span>.</p><p><a href="1179f1a.html" target="_self">Figure 1a: Group Manager Screen</a></p><p><a href="1179f1b.html" target="_self">Figure 1b: Edit User
Screen</a></p><p>Glint facilitates the addition or removal of software from an
existing system. <a href="1179f2.html" target="_self">Figure 2</a> shows
the initial display when glint is activated. Red Hat packages are
organized in hierarchies. For example, X11 is a &ldquo;root&rdquo; hierarchy.
Under it are Applications, XFree86, Libraries, etc. Under XFree86
is Servers and then finally some packages, such as XFree86-fonts,
XFree86-devel and XFree86 itself. Each of these packages also has a
version number that is used to identify upgrades.</p><p><a href="1179f2.html" target="_self">Figure 2. Initial glint
Screen</a></p><p><a href="1179f3.html" target="_self">Figure 3</a> displays what an
installer sees when the font package is selected and the Query
button is clicked: a description of the package is displayed with a
list of all of the files contained in it. From here the package's
contents can be verified if a problem is suspected or if a user
needs to know what files are installed on a workstation.</p><p><a href="1179f3.html" target="_self">Figure 3. Font Query
Screen</a></p><p>In order to add packages, the installer simply specifies the
package location with the Configure button (the packages can come
from CDROM or an NFS mounted volume) and then selects the Available
button.</p><p>The Desktop provides support for associating files with
default actions. For example, when double clicked, the Caldera_Info
icon (see <a href="1179f4.html" target="_self">Figure 4</a>) launches the
Arena Web Browser with the contents of the Calder_Info file.</p><p><a href="1179f4.html" target="_self">Figure 4. Caldera Network
Desktop</a></p><p>The Desktop itself can be configured as a window, as shown in
<a href="1179f4.html" target="_self">Figure 4</a>, or as the root window,
much like MacIntosh's Finder.</p><p>Directories can be opened into windows similar to the
desktop. For example, if the user wishes to add an icon for
<span   class="bold"><b>Seyon</b></span> to the desktop area, the
/usr/X11R6/bin directory could be opened and the icon for Seyon
could be dragged into the Desktop window. This doesn't move the
file: it simply creates an icon.</p><p>There are many more features offered by the
Desktop&mdash;covering all of them would make this article far too
long&mdash;and duplicate the included HTML documentation.</p><p>A demo version of the CRISP editor is also included, which is
configured as the default desktop action for text files, and as the
default text editor. The full version is available to Linux users
for a discounted price. It is a very complete editor for
programmers and system administrators, from what I can see.
(Unfortunately, we can only read about these features, since almost
all of them are disabled in the &ldquo;lite&rdquo; version offered for
preview, which has fewer features than emacs or vi.)</p><p>I was unable to try out the Netware Client features, since
the Novell Servers at my office were already &ldquo;having some
problems&rdquo; (it's a long story). Since Caldera has a working
relationship with Novell, I don't think I would have found any
problems. Caldera made an effort to integrate Netware support in a
way that fits the Linux/Unix file-system paradigm, and from the
looks of the documentation, they succeeded. The client locates
servers for the user and auto-mounts directory and objects. After
being authenticated, the user has automated access to the files for
which the account has permissions.</p><p>The Caldera Font Server supports TrueType, Postscript and
SPEEDO fonts, an easily overlooked feature. Access to these fonts
will make software such as WordPerfect even more valuable. It also
offers a graphical management tool that allows the administrator to
view, install and delete fonts. The BACKUP.UUNET utility is a
backup system licensed from MTI, a RAID system manufacturer. This
utility alone would be worth devoting a separate review to.</p><p>Bundling in a product like this is a key feature of the
Network Desktop. This product provides comprehensive network backup
and restore capabilities, and makes the idea of supporting an
entire office or enterprise system running Caldera Network Desktop
a serious possibility.</p><p>For Internet connectivity the Network Desktop includes a Web
Browser, Web server, compiled versions of
<span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>dip</b></span>, and the
<span   class="bold"><b>tcpd</b></span> wrapper program. The
<span   class="bold"><b>tcpd</b></span> program provides a very
important security feature by allowing the administrator to control
who can access workstation services.</p><p>In conclusion, the Caldera Network Desktop is a worthwhile
product for Linux users of all levels. I read once that the measure
of usability for an operating system is this: Which one would you
recommend to your computer illiterate friends? Previous to the
Network Desktop, recommending a Linux release to these friends
meant agreeing to provide unlimited free technical support. With
the Network Desktop, Linux becomes in many ways a better bet than
Windows 95 or OS/2. For experienced Linux users, the Network
Desktop is an excellent bundling of the important network support
tools, a beautiful mechanism for installing and removing software,
and a handy collection of third party tools.</p><p><a href="1179f5.html" target="_self">Figure 5. Sample Directory on
CND</a></p><p>As I said earlier, Caldera Network Desktop is more than a
single product, and a single article like this cannot provide a
fully comprehensive review. I hope, however, I have provided you
with enough information to decide whether or not to use or
recommend CND.</p></div></div>
