the week of November 13 at the Washington Convention Center,
Washington, DC. The show included the second annual Linux
Conference, sponsored by <i  >Linux Journal</i>, which
featured a day of informative sessions and tutorials and a one-day
class for novices and intermediate Linux users. The first day
covered several topics, including an introduction to Linux,
building a World Wide Web site with Linux, and porting to Linux.
The one-day class, entitled &ldquo;Linux for the New User&rdquo;, was taught
by the Editor of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, Michael K.
Johnson.
</p><p>The trade show ran for two days following the Linux
conference. Most of the Linux-related companies were in the same
area and received a lot of traffic. The overall feel of the show
was that Linux was one of the &ldquo;hottest&rdquo; topics and that we needed
to work together to ensure the success of the &ldquo;better&rdquo;
system.</p><p>Caldera had one of the largest Linux-related booths and was
situated towards the center of the show floor. Open Systems World
also set up a 40'x40' &ldquo;Linux-Lounge&rdquo; next to the Digital booth
consisting of three cocktail tables surrounded by chairs where
people could sit and talk about Linux. Whenever I passed the Linux
Lounge, it was packed with people doing just that.</p><p>Although Open Systems World/FedUNIX occurred in Washington, DC
during a federal government shutdown and the same week as Comdex in
Las Vegas, it looked as though the Linux Conference was a success,
and we are looking forward to next year.</p></div></div>
