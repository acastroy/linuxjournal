    Everyone tells you how important it is to make backups.
    Explicit guidelines, however, are often lacking. Which files
    should you back up, and how often? This article will
    help you answer those questions, and use the answers to
    develop your own backup strategy.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2342580.0x243a3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Broadly speaking, we can identify two
types of backup; the <span   class="emphasis"><em>system</em></span> backup, which is a
backup of the operating system and applications (the things only
the sysadmin can alter), and the <span   class="emphasis"><em>user</em></span> backup,
which is a backup of the users' files (I don't know if anyone else
uses these terms, but they'll do for the purposes of this article).
As we shall see, system backups and user backups should be treated
differently.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2342580.0x243a5b0"></a>System backups</h2></div></div><p>The reason for making system backups is to minimize the
effort required, following a crash, to get the system up and
running as it was before disaster struck. However, you don't want
to spend half your life backing up your disk; no one said it was
fun! The key to backing up effectively is to back up only that
which is absolutely necessary to enable speedy recovery when
disaster strikes.</p><p>Think about it: most of your system is pretty stable&mdash;the
contents of /usr/bin don't change that often, do they? To make
things even easier, you probably have a rough copy of your system
already; most people install Linux from a distribution of some
sort, then make their own customizations. The original distribution
is likely to be the starting point of a recovery for many of
us.</p><p>Linux differs from most other operating systems in that the
operating system and a large number of applications are typically
installed in one go, whereas DOS-based systems and even Unix-based
systems other than Linux tend to be installed in a more piece-wise
fashion; first the operating system, then each application,
one-by-one. For those systems, it makes sense to back up the whole
system; usually a lot of time and care has been invested in setting
the system up in the first place. By contrast, installing or
re-installing a basic Linux system (complete with applications) is
usually a quick and painless affair.</p><p>Having just said that most of your system is pretty stable,
let's consider what is likely to change. One way you will customize
your system is by adding new programs (software that didn't come as
part of your distribution). When installing new software, you
should be strict with yourself, and keep any new programs separate
from those on the distribution. The best place for them is in the
/usr/local hierarchy. As its name suggests, /usr/local is designed
to contain programs that are local to <span   class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span>
system. The advantage in doing this is that you can easily see
which programs you can restore from your distribution, and which
programs you need to restore from elsewhere.</p><p>Another thing you are likely to change is the configuration
files the standard programs use. The behaviour of many standard
Linux utilities is controlled by simple text files, which you can
edit to tailor your system to your requirements. Sometimes
distributions will &ldquo;invisibly&rdquo; edit some of these text files for
you, based on your responses to certain questions, but often you
have to edit them yourself.</p><p>A lot of the important files live in the /etc
directory:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>/etc/printcap&mdash;describes how to communicate with
your printers</p></li><li><p>/etc/fstab&mdash;describes what file-systems you
have</p></li><li><p>/etc/passwd&mdash;contains a list of all users, and
their (encrypted) passwords</p></li><li><p>/etc/inittab&mdash;tells init how to set the system up
for a given run level</p></li><li><p>/etc/XF86Config&mdash;describes the initial setup of
XFree86</p></li></ul></div><p>Depending on your system, there are likely to be many others
as well. As you can see, the /etc directory is very important, and
the files it contains are likely to be the result of hours of work.
I don't know if I'm typical, but I spent a long time just getting
XF86Config exactly how I want it. The thought of going through that
again is enough to make me shudder. Of course, some programs will
use files in other places, but most of the basic Linux system is
configured using files in /etc.</p><p>When you modify the configuration files used by an existing
program, you can't move them somewhere else; the program (usually)
looks for them in a particular place. Therefore, it is important to
keep track of what changes you've made, so that, should disaster
strike, you can get them back easily. Make a note of all the
modifications you make to the system, no matter how trivial they
seem at the time.</p><p>The best tool for the job is a pen and some paper. Write
yourself long descriptions of what you've done, and why. Don't fall
into the trap of thinking that in six months time you'll remember
just how you got application Y to compile, or what the printcap
entry to filter your postscript files through ghostscript was,
because the chances are you won't. Even if you are installing new
software in a separate directory so it's easy to keep track of, it
won't hurt to write down what you installed, when you installed it,
and if there were any things that didn't seem obvious at the
time.</p><p>Now that we've identified <span   class="emphasis"><em>what kind</em></span> of
system files we need to back up, let's consider <span   class="emphasis"><em>how
often</em></span>. Just after you've made a change is probably the
most important time, but don't forget to keep a backup of how the
system was before the latest change, just in case things do go
wrong later because of your change. The point is that things only
change when you change them, which probably isn't very often, and
the frequency of your backups should reflect this.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2342580.0x243aea0"></a>User Backups</h2></div></div><p>ser backups are different from system backups, in that a
user's files are liable to change frequently. It will almost
certainly be impossible for you to have up-to-the-minute backups of
a given user's file space, and you shouldn't even try. In backing
up user files, you are offering your users a virtual safety
net&mdash;reasonably recent copies of their files they can fall back on
if they do something silly (like <b  >rm * bak</b>
instead of <b  >rm *.bak</b>&mdash;it does happen!), or if
the hard disk fails.</p><p>User backups will have to be done much more frequently than
system backups, perhaps even daily (the cron program enables you to
run programs at regular intervals, without having to issue the same
commands each time&mdash;<a href="1208s1.html" target="_self">see the cron
sidebar</a>).</p><p>One useful feature of many backup programs (including tar) is
the ability to backup only files which have changed after a certain
date (the last time you did a backup, for example). This can
drastically reduce the amount of work in a user backup, since a
user is likely to be working on only a small number of files at a
given time. You can combine full backups of your user space every
so often with more frequent incremental backups.</p><p>While it is possible to use floppy disks for your backups,
each disk can only hold a small amount of data. Many programs allow
a backup to span several disks, but this means that you have to be
there to change them while the backup is taking place. If you only
have a small system with few users, then this might be feasible,
but often it isn't. Magnetic or digital tapes are probably a better
choice, simply because of their higher capacity. Linux supports a
wide range of tape drives, either via the ftape module or its SCSI
support (digital drives are almost always SCSI). The price of tape
drives has fallen quite dramatically in the last 18 months or so,
and they are now a realistic option for many of us. Alternatively,
your Linux box might be on the same network as another machine with
a tape drive. Linux can access tapes on remote machines, but that
is beyond the scope of this article.</p><p>Whatever media you choose, you should look after it. Your
backup is there for when things go wrong, so it is important that
you can rely on it. You should always verify your backups; it is
often said that an unverified backup is worse than no backup at
all.</p><p>You should also keep more than one set of backups. A popular
strategy is based on the &ldquo;grandfather-father-son&rdquo; idea. You have
three sets of backups; the last one (the son), the one before that
(the father), and the one before that (the grandfather). When you
do your next backup, you copy over the grandfather, so the son
becomes the father, the father becomes the grandfather, and the
grandfather is replaced with a new son. The advantage of this
strategy is that should one of the sets fail, you at least have
something to fall back on, but you don't have to make more than one
backup at a time.</p><p>The next piece of advice might sound strange at first: always
keep at least one backup well away from your machine, preferably in
a completely different building. Why? Well, what if the building
burns down? You can replace the machine, and get a new Linux
distribution, but you won't be able to replace your backup tapes.
The data on your computer is its most valuable and irreplaceable
component, so treat it with care.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2342580.0x243b2c0"></a>How?</h2></div></div><p>Okay, enough of the chat&mdash;let's see some examples. There are
many different backup programs available, both freeware and
commercial. Each has its merits, but for these examples, I'm going
to use tar (GNU version 1.11.2).</p><p>Suppose you've just installed a lot of new software in
/usr/local, and think it's time you updated your backup of the
whole /usr/local tree. You don't have a tape drive, so you're using
floppies. A command like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar -cWMf /dev/fd0 /usr/local
</pre><p>will do the trick. The <b  >c</b> option means
create an archive, <b  >W</b> means attempt to verify the
archive after writing, <b  >M</b> tells tar to span more
than one floppy if it needs to, and the <b  >f</b> option
tells tar where to write the archive, in this case to
/dev/fd0&mdash;the floppy disk drive. On many systems, you will have to
be root in order to access /dev/fd0 directly.</p><p>Even though I've requested verify, it doesn't hurt to check.
The command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar -tMf /dev/fd0
</pre><p>will show a list of all the files backed up. Depending on the
size of your /usr/local tree, you might need several floppies. You
could reduce the number of disks needed by using tar's compression
option; the <b  >z</b> flag will tell tar to filter the
archive through gzip, thus saving disk space. A good idea? Well,
yes and no. While it is attractive to save disk (or tape) space,
compressing a lot of files together is risky. It means that the
slightest corruption is likely to destroy the whole backup, whereas
if the archive is uncompressed, it might be possible to read past
any errors, and retrieve at least some of your data. Some programs
compress files individually before backing them up, and this is
probably a better idea.</p><p>I mentioned earlier that it is possible to back up files that
have been modified since a certain time. With tar, you can achieve
this using the <b  >N</b> option. For example,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar -cf /dev/ftape -N yesterday /home
</pre><p>will backup all files under /home which have been altered
since yesterday, this time to a floppy tape device /dev/ftape. An
alternative approach would be to use a combination of find and
tar:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find /home -cnewer /etc/last_backup \
  -type f i-print &gt; back_these_up
$ tar -cf /dev/ftape -T back_these_up
$ touch /etc/last_backup
</pre><p>Here, the find command finds all files under /home which have
had their contents altered since the file /etc/last_backup was last
modified, and writes their names to a file called back_these_up.
The <b  >T</b> option tells the tar command to back up
the files listed in back_these_up. Then we
<span   class="bold"><b>touch</b></span> the file /etc/last_backup,
so that the next time we do this sequence of commands, we get the
files that have been modified since this backup. Combining several
commands like this is quite useful; as a side effect, we have a
list of files that have been backed up, as well as the time of the
last backup (the timestamp of the file /etc/last_backup).</p><p>Another thing we could do is to filter the list of files, so
that certain files don't get backed up. For example, you might not
want to back up object files, or DVI files, since they can easily
be recreated from the source code (which is usually a much smaller
file!). A simple <b  >grep -v</b> will do the trick if
there is only one kind of file you want to ignore; egrep can be
used to ignore several kinds of files. Change the first line above
to something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find /home -cnewer /etc/last_backup \
  -type f i-print | egrep -v '&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;.o$|&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;.dvi$' \
  &gt; back_these_up
</pre><p>to ignore object and dvi files. It's also possible to do the
same kind of thing with find for this simple example, although it
doesn't have egrep's powerful regular expressions:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find /home -cnewer /etc/last_backup \
  -type f ! \( -name \*.o -o -name \*.dvi \) \
  -print &gt; back_these_up
</pre><p>It is likely that your exact backup requirements can't be met
easily by a single tar command, so don't be afraid to write your
own little scripts to do the job. They can be as simple as the
three line example above, or as complicated as you like. A few
simple scripts, run regularly using cron, can make backing up a
very easy process.</p><p>Backing up needn't be a protracted form of torture. It needs
to be done, and as a sysadmin you have to do it, but a bit of
planning and clear thinking goes a long way. It is easy to feel
that you must have a complete current snapshot of your entire hard
disk at all times, and equally easy to believe that a six-month old
copy of a few files lying about somewhere will do. The best
strategy lies somewhere in between.</p></div></div>
