    A short report from the Linux users group in Tokyo, Japan&mdash;what
    they are doing now and their plans for the future.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27d2580.0x28ca348"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Tokyo LUG is unique in many ways. The
membership is international, comprised of people from dozens of
European, North American and Asian countries living in Tokyo and
unified by a common love of Linux. The group is active in helping
people around the world understand how well Linux supports Japanese
text through the use of its highly publicized web page,
http://www.twics.com/~tlug/, and active majordomo mailing list,
majordomo@lists.twics.com (subscribe tlug). If you've never tried
Linux with Japanese, look at our home page and see how easy it is.
</p><p>Perhaps due to the group's visible roles in the Japanese and
international Linux communities, the group has been able to get
donations from sponsors. In the past six months, the group has
distributed TLUG prizes to the Linux community in Japan such as
T-shirts from Caldera, a half-dozen functional SPARC machines with
monitors, three 17-inch color SPARC monitors, Caldera OpenLinux
Lite, Open DOS, Red Hat Linux, Star Office, O'Reilly books and
more. (Contact craig@twics.com if you are a vendor wishing to
promote your products to TLUG members. We warmly welcome
samples.)</p><p>The Tokyo Linux Users Group is also unique in that its
members communicate in English although most of the Linux activity
in Japan is in Japanese. This gives TLUG's members a more global
perspective on Linux and also helps many people outside of Japan
get better acquainted with Linux lovers in Japan. Hey, we're just
like you!</p><p>Last October, a month after the third anniversary of the
first official TLUG meeting, an enthusiastic group of Linux users
in Tokyo celebrated with food, beer and Linux installations. From a
small pioneering group meeting in 1994, the group had grown to the
point where its home page had received over 1,000 hits in a single
week, and the meeting room was now equipped with overhead Ethernet
for a network of Linux machines on SPARC and Intel hardware. The
October 12th meeting resulted in election of group officers and
official registration with the G.L.U.E. organization sponsored by
SSC: http://www.linuxresources.com/glue/.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2660f1.jpg"></div><p>Just like the other Linux users around the world, we in Tokyo
seek to contribute to the Linux community. In our fourth year as a
LUG we'll try to give more to the international Linux community in
the form of multilingual software patches, guidelines for
multilingual software development, more information on Japanese
text and X displays and more information on how to input Japanese.
Expanding beyond internationalization, Linux users in the dynamic
high-tech city of Tokyo are also involved in key development
projects that extend the basic capability of Linux. Look for us in
an Internet neighborhood near you.</p></div></div>
