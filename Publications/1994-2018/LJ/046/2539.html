    Web server analysis logs and mailing list management is made
    easy by using the /rdb database system&mdash;here's how to do it.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e88580.0x1f804a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The /rdb database system from
Revolutionary Software is a compact, low-cost relational database
management system that has been available for Linux and other Unix
variants for several years. It distinguishes itself from most (if
not all) other Unix database systems by functioning as an extension
of the Unix shell.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e88580.0x1f805b0"></a>The Unix Approach to Application Design</h2></div></div><p>The typical Unix distribution contains a rich set of shell
commands (often referred to as <span   class="emphasis"><em>filters</em></span>) such
as <span   class="bold"><b>awk</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span> that operate primarily on text
data. In addition, <span   class="emphasis"><em>pipes</em></span> can be used to route
the output from one command into the input of another command.
These commands can either be standard commands like those mentioned
above or be created by the user. This system of pipes and filters
simplifies the development of complex applications by enabling the
reuse of components that have already been tested and
proven.</p><p>Most filters are designed to operate on ASCII text data, so
it is natural to represent logical data records as ASCII text
lines. Data elements within the records are separated by a field
delimiter character (such as a colon or tab) specified by the
application. Alphanumeric data elements such as names, addresses
and descriptions can be as long or as short as needed. Numeric data
elements can have unlimited magnitude and precision, and their
representation is architecture independent. This scheme provides
complete portability of data between platforms.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e88580.0x1f808c8"></a>Other Approaches</h2></div></div><p>Approaches to application design inherited from other
platforms typically use fixed-length fields with predetermined
field lengths. These lengths result in wasted file space due to the
unpredictability of an application's actual storage requirements.
Numeric data is often stored in binary format which makes it highly
platform specific and nonportable. Data elements such as
&ldquo;description&rdquo; or &ldquo;comment&rdquo; fields can vary greatly in size, and
the use of fixed-length fields forces the application designer to
either allocate enough storage to cover all cases (often
impossible) or to dedicate separate data files to their storage
(often making application logic clumsy, complex and difficult to
manage).</p><p>The result of these approaches is the allocation of disk
space that is never used and application programs that are
difficult to maintain. Although recent innovations such as SQL have
simplified the problem of data access from applications, many
programs are tightly bound to storage layouts determined at compile
time. This binding of code to data forces recompilation and
relinking of application code each time a change in record format
is required. Worse yet, many applications use &ldquo;filler fields&rdquo; to
avoid recompilation, wasting even more disk space and I/O
bandwidth.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e88580.0x1f80a28"></a>Application Design Using /rdb</h2></div></div><p>While a great many Unix systems (database systems included)
use the approach outlined in the last section, /rdb augments the
capabilities already provided by standard Unix shell commands. Many
/rdb commands operate as front ends for standard Unix commands such
as awk. This enables users already familiar with Unix to create
/rdb applications without learning a new programming
language.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e88580.0x1f80b30"></a>Table Format</h2></div></div><p>The format of /rdb tables is extremely simple. They are ASCII
text files in which a row is a line of data. The column elements
within each row are delimited by a column separation character (a
tab by default but any other character except the newline can be
used). /rdb commands use a <b  >-f</b> command line
switch to specify a column separator in cases where it is not a
tab. Note the similarity between this approach and typical Unix
system configuration data files such as /etc/passwd. The only
difference is that the first line of /rdb tables is a delimited set
of field names and the second line is a line of dashes. These first
two lines are known as a header.</p><p>Part of the beauty of /rdb tables is that, for some
applications, they need not even be stored in disk files. Instead,
they can be passed between commands using pipes. These commands can
be /rdb commands or standard Unix shell commands. The /rdb commands
are designed to output tables through
<span   class="bold"><b>stdout</b></span>, and most accept input
tables through <span   class="bold"><b>stdin</b></span>. Although
some standard Unix commands will be &ldquo;confused&rdquo; by the header
lines, /rdb provides commands for removing and reattaching these
headers (<span   class="bold"><b>headoff</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>headon</b></span>, respectively).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e88580.0x1f80e48"></a>/rdb Filters</h2></div></div><p>Most /rdb commands operate on tables that are read through
stdin. The resulting table is written to stdout. Here are a few
examples:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
row 'Cost &lt; 50' inventory
</pre><p>selects the rows in the inventory table where the Cost field
is less than 50.
<pre     class="programlisting">
column 'Description' &lt; inventory
</pre>


reads the inventory table and outputs a table containing only the
column Description.
<pre     class="programlisting">
addcol 'Value' &lt; inventory
</pre>


reads inventory and outputs a new table that is identical to
inventory except for the addition of a new column called Value. At
this point, all of the fields in the Value column are initialized
to empty strings.
<pre     class="programlisting">
compute 'Value = Cost * Quantity'
</pre>


reads an input table and, on each row, sets Value to Cost *
Quantity. If Value is a column name, the computed value is stored
in the table; otherwise, it could still be referenced in other
statements within the same compute statement.
</p><p>Putting these commands together, the Bourne shell script in
<a href="2539l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> will output a table
describing inventory items which cost less than $50 US and showing
the value of each.</p><p>These commands are only a few of the filters that /rdb
provides. For a complete listing, see the on-line man pages listed
in Resources.</p><p>The row and compute filters are actually front ends for awk.
Since awk doesn't understand field names as defined by /rdb, these
commands convert field names into column numbers which awk does
understand. As a result, the user who is familiar with awk can
immediately use these commands and many others provided by
/rdb.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e88580.0x1f81268"></a>/rdb Table Editing</h2></div></div><p>Because /rdb tables are ASCII files, they can be created and
maintained by any text editor. This will work in many cases but
will be awkward in others, in particular, with wide tables or those
containing a large number of columns. /rdb provides two table
editors, <span   class="bold"><b>ve</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>jve</b></span> for this purpose. A complete
description of these editors is beyond the scope of this article,
but the following is a partial list of the capabilities
provided:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Forms based data
entry:</b></span> Screen files, ASCII files describing data-entry
screen layout, can be specified using the <b  >-s</b>
option and are used to associate screen field positions with table
column names and to provide initialization and write protection for
certain fields.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Data validation:</b></span>
The <b  >-v</b> option is used to specify a validation
file to provide data edits based on allowed and disallowed ranges
of characters, column length limits, table lookup and command-based
validation. With command-based validation, the values can be passed
to any arbitrary command or shell script. The exit status indicates
to jve whether or not the data is considered valid (zero for
success, non-zero for failure). If a non-zero status is received,
jve will beep and display the first line of standard error at the
bottom of the screen.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Audit file creation and
maintenance:</b></span> An audit file tracks changes to a table and
can be used by the <span   class="bold"><b>rollback</b></span>
command to restore a table to a specific point in time.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e88580.0x1f81898"></a>Web Server Log Analysis</h2></div></div><p>In order to illustrate how /rdb operates in conjunction with
other Unix shell commands, the script in
<a href="2539l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a> shows how a log file can
be analyzed to report a server's top five accessors. This script
assumes that stdin is a log file with space delimited fields with
the host name as the first field (this is typical for Apache and
several other web servers). The following is a step by step
description of the process:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The combination of awk and the
<span   class="bold"><b>header</b></span> command produces a table
with host names in order of their appearance in the log file. The
output from awk is not in /rdb table format, so header is used to
complete the production of the table.</p></li><li><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>addcol</b></span> command
followed by compute is used to add a column named n and initialize
its value to 1.</p></li><li><p>The table is then sorted by host and the n values
are totaled using host as a control break to produce a table of the
host names and the total access counts for each, i.e., the value of
n.</p></li><li><p>Since we are interested in seeing the five hosts
with the highest access counts, the table produced in step 3 is
sorted by n.</p></li><li><p>The top seven lines from the table in step 4 (two
header lines plus five rows) are filtered out by the
<span   class="bold"><b>head</b></span> command and passed to the
<span   class="bold"><b>justify</b></span> command which vertically
aligns the header and columns and produces a format better suited
to printing.</p></li></ol></div><p>The script in Listing 2 produces the following output:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
host n
wilbur.leba.net 106
gateway.amat.com        24
208.219.77.9    20
ras3.fsxnet.com 14
ohnp6.m50.nrc.ca        14
</pre><p>Actually, it wasn't necessary to create and store any /rdb
tables.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e88580.0x237a278"></a>Mailing List Processing</h2></div></div><p>Now we look at a slightly more complex example: the
generation of mailing labels. Assuming that stdin is an /rdb table
with fields named <b  >Salut</b> (Mr., Mrs., etc.),
<b  >Fname</b>, <b  >Lname</b>,
<b  >Address1</b>, <b  >Address2</b> (sometimes
blank), <b  >City</b>, <b  >State</b> and
<b  >Zip</b>, we create the script shown in
<a href="2539l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>.</p><p>For each row in the table, this script creates a mailing
label with either three or four lines (depending on whether or not
the second address line was used). After adding columns to
represent the lines in our final output, the compute command
determines their contents. The resulting table is sorted by zip
code so that the labels are grouped for bulk mailing purposes. The
<span   class="bold"><b>report</b></span> command formats the output
using the report.frm file shown here:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;Line1&gt;
&lt;Line2&gt;
&lt;Line3&gt;
&lt;Line4&gt;
</pre><p>This file is a very simple example of a report form file used
by /rdb to generate reports. A field name within brackets indicates
the substitution of the contents of the named field.
</p><p>Other report file options are available as well, although we
won't describe them here. One of the most significant options is
the placement of output from shell commands. In this example, the
output from report is a series of labels in a single column. This
data is piped into <span   class="bold"><b>pr</b></span> which
arranges it into two columns.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e88580.0x237a8a8"></a>Other /rdb Features</h2></div></div><p>There are five access methods provided by /rdb:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>sequential</em></span> (used by the above examples),
<span   class="emphasis"><em>record</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>binary</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>inverted</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>hashed</em></span>. An
<span   class="bold"><b>index</b></span> command is provided to build
index files, and a <span   class="bold"><b>search</b></span> command
is used to execute keyed retrievals.</p><p>A set of library functions, librdb.a, is provided for use by
those who require access through C programs. Complete C source code
for these functions is also included.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e88580.0x237ac70"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>/rdb is a powerful but low cost package suitable for a large
variety of database management tasks. It offers the following
benefits:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Low cost</b></span>: Only
$149US for Linux, SCO and other Intel Unix implementations, $495US
for RISC platforms.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Short learning
curve</b></span>: Users already familiar with Unix become
proficient quickly.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Low Hardware
Requirements</b></span>: /rdb requires under 5MB of disc space to
install. /rdb commands are compact since they function mostly as
front ends for standard Unix tools. The mailing list application
presented above is a &ldquo;real world&rdquo; program that was previously
done using a dBase file. Since the dBase file used fixed-length
fields, they contained a lot of trailing blanks which were
eliminated when converted to an /rdb table. As a result, the /rdb
table was roughly one third the size of the original dBase
file.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Integrates well with other
Unix commands</b></span>: This point is illustrated in the web
server log analysis example. One could easily create generic
interface programs for other systems (including other databases)
and using /rdb to provide data entry and validation on the input
side and report generation on the output side.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Portability of data and
code</b></span>: This is becoming increasingly important as
networked computing environments become more common.</p></li></ul></div><p>The only disadvantage is that platform-independent systems
generally run slower than those that are machine specific. Also,
variable- length records tend to be more difficult to manage than
fixed-length ones. Even so, /rdb performs well even with large
databases (see Resources for pointers to demos available on the
Web). Even in the extreme cases where a more traditional database
system may be needed, /rdb can still be used as a front end as
shown in Listing 2.</p><p>Finally, the economic considerations involved in the hardware
independence versus performance tradeoff are clear. Hardware
price/performance ratios are dropping rapidly while the cost of
programmer time is constantly rising. This being the case, hardware
independence is the uncontested winner.</p><p><a href="2539s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
