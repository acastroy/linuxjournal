    The story of how Progressive Computer Concepts has turned
    United Railway into a Linux shop.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2302f1.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcc6580.0xdbe7c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>I remember being amazed and somewhat
impressed in September of 1995 when I made my first trip to the
main offices of United Railway Signal Group, Inc. in Jacksonville,
Florida. I was impressed that their computer network worked at all,
much less that they actually got quite a bit of work done using it.
United had the longest single run of 10Base-2 I had ever seen,
connecting approximately 30 computers to two Novell Netware servers
that lived in a halon fire-protected room at one end of the
offices.</p><p>The primary server was Netware 3.12 on an Intel P90 with 64MB
of RAM, three Adaptec 2940 SCSI controllers, two one gigabyte SCSI
hard disks and a 20 cartridge, 26GB Maxoptix magneto-optical
jukebox. One of the 1GB disks was exported from both IPX/SPX and
Netware NFS as &ldquo;ursgpub&rdquo;, a shared network file system containing
shared data and a collection of custom FoxPro applications to track
such information as project flow and time sheets.</p><p>The magneto-optical jukebox was being used at about 80%
capacity. Corel SCSI for Netware controlled the jukebox and used
one of the 1GB disks as its &ldquo;cache volume&rdquo;. A DOS TSR was needed
on the client side for the PCs to see the jukebox as a contiguous
26GB file system. United's Unix CAD stations needed access to data
on the jukebox, as did the PC CAD stations and office PCs. Netware
NFS had no knowledge of the jukebox, as the jukebox was handled
entirely by the Corel SCSI NLMs. In order to allow the Unix CAD
stations some limited access to that data, the jukebox's &ldquo;cache
volume&rdquo; had to be NFS exported. NFS exporting of the cache volume
from underneath Corel SCSI proved to be the source of many problems
and a constant headache.</p><p>The other server, an Intel P75 with 32MB of RAM, ran Netware
4.1. Its sole responsibility was to do backups. ArcServe, the
package United used for backups, could never be made to run on the
Netware 3.12 server. Thus, United's only option was to purchase a
60-user license Netware 4.1 server for ArcServe and to install the
WinAgent client software on each PC. ArcServe never seemed to run
properly on this backup server either, crashing almost nightly with
out of memory errors or hanging when a client PC's WinAgent
software hung.</p><p>In mid-October of 1995 we, Progressive Computer Concepts,
connected United's main office to the Internet via a dedicated ISDN
line using an Ascend Pipeline 50. We installed Linux 1.2.13 on an
Intel P90 with 32MB of RAM, a BusLogic 956C and a 1GB SCSI disk to
handle DNS, e-mail, WWW and FTP service.</p><p>From my time spent at United performing this work, it became
obvious to me that the Netware solution was falling apart. The
Netware server aborted about once per week (and checking the
jukebox's file systems on reboot took hours). Nightly backups via
ArcServe failed in some manner almost daily, and hours were wasted
each day by United's Netware administrator manually reviewing logs
and checking the contents of tapes. I began expressing my opinion
that Linux would be a better solution to United's CEO, Mike
Wilson.</p><p>Over time, the reliability of the one Linux server that
handled the Internet operations became more and more clear. I would
e-mail Mike an uptime report every 30 days or so. The pivotal point
in moving United away from Netware to Linux came when United's
Netware system administrator resigned. The door was now opened for
us to step in.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcc6580.0xdbead8"></a>Where We Went</h2></div></div><p>In June 1996 we began the formidable task of moving United's
entire operation from Netware to Linux. The first to go was the
backup server&mdash;a Linux boot disk and about an hour turned that
little P75 into United's first Linux file server named ursgfs2. We
immediately installed SAMBA and
<span   class="bold"><b>smbfs</b></span> and began writing backup
scripts. After removing WinAgent and setting up an administrative
share on each PC, we did a full floor backup to the 4mm tape drives
in the new Linux server that very night; the backups completed
through every machine without error.</p><p>We purchased three BusLogic 958 SCSI controllers and four 4GB
fast wide SCSI II Quantum Atlas drives in external cases and
attached them to the P75 Linux server, ursgfs2. Now, we needed a
way to move many gigabytes of CAD files and corporate data off the
26GB magneto-optical jukebox connected to the Netware server, at
that time accessible only through a DOS machine using Netware
drivers plus a TSR program. We tried various unsuccessful
methods.</p><p>All of our attempts on DOS clients failed with out of memory
errors while trying to <span   class="bold"><b>pkzip</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>xcopy</b></span> files from the jukebox
cartridges. The Corel TSR would load under NT but would crash and
die at random points during the copy process. We never got NT to
successfully copy a single cartridge. Using
<span   class="bold"><b>ncpmount</b></span> we could mount the
jukebox from the Netware server under Linux, but without the TSR
the Netware server would kick us off within 60 seconds. The
solution was DOSEMU. DOSEMU, when installed on ursgfs2 allowed us
to run the Corel TSR, attach to the jukebox on the Netware server
and then copy directly to the attached 16GB of new disk space using
the xcopy command.</p><p>Due to an inefficiency in the FAT (finessed automatic
transfer) file system, the FAT tables on the jukebox cartridges
were filling long before the cartridges were actually full of data.
We were able to store all of the jukebox data onto 16GB of disk
space. After the transfer of all of the jukebox data was complete,
we blew Netware off the larger server, moved ursgfs2's SCSI cards
and disks to the new hardware, and renamed the server ursgfs1. A
fifth disk was added a short time later.</p><p>The new Linux file server used SAMBA for exporting to PCs and
NFS for Unix workstations. The server had three 4mm tape drives.
Our backup scripts used <span   class="bold"><b>smbmount</b></span>
to mount each PC in the building and archive it on tape using
<span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span>. Soon, an eight-port Lantronix
10/100 switch was installed, and ursgfs1 was moved to a dedicated
100MB port.</p><p>United has a number of CAD stations in each of its offices,
where CAD operators work each day on various engineering projects.
While using the Netware/ArcServe system, each night ArcServe would
copy CAD files from a specific directory hierarchy on each CAD
station, in-turn, to the read-only CAD file hierarchy on the
Netware server. The potential existed for two different projects
inside United to involve the same CAD files. This situation is
particularly dangerous when the two CAD operators involved are
unaware that they are both working on the same set of files. Under
the old Netware/ArcServe system the fact that two CAD operators had
been working on the same CAD files, simultaneously, could only be
detected by a human and was often not discovered for days or weeks.
Much redo CAD work (recadding) would have to be done when those
situations were discovered.</p><p>To solve this problem, our next software project for United
was to write a custom file retrieval and archive commit program
that would be, in effect, a revision control system. Every night,
the working directories of each CAD station are copied by ursgfs1
to scratch space. Files are then put through a number of sanity
checks to detect duplicate works-in-progress, verify file revision
and time stamps, file sizes, etc. Files passing all criteria are
copied into the read-only CAD file hierarchy; currently, existing
files replaced by this process are put into a daily incremental
backup. Sixty days' worth of these incrementals are kept in
mid-line storage, and any version of any file can be rolled back if
needed. Summary reports of committed files and rejected files (if
any) are e-mailed to the administrators and to a hypermail archive
each night. This system is written entirely in Perl 5 and has been
in place, working successfully, since October 25, 1996. The system
has recently been expanded to include United's Omaha office.</p><p>After the back-up work was completed, we began developing
custom Intranet applications for United. We replaced most legacy
FoxPro LAN applications with more fully featured and more tightly
integrated Intranet programs. The Intranet system, the URSG Daily
Operations Control System as it is called, is written entirely in
Perl 5. URSGDOCS originally used MiniSQL as its back-end database,
but has been ported to and using MySQL for many months now. Once
all of the legacy applications like time-sheet entry and project
management had been replaced by the Intranet system, we upgraded
United's main office Internet connection to 1.536MB T1. United's
remote offices in San Francisco, Omaha and Jacksonville (the
manufacturing facility) immediately began using URSGDOCS via
dial-up Internet connections.</p><p><a href="2302f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Internet Screen for URSGDOCS</b></span></a></p><p>Later, we added a &ldquo;Fax This Page&rdquo; button to the bottom of
all the reports that a user might wish to retrieve from United's
Daily Operations Control System. A retired 386DX40 was given 32MB
of RAM and an eight-port Comtrol Rocketport board. It now runs
multiple PPP dial-in sessions, various network sniffers and all of
the URSGDOCS faxing subsystem. The URSGDOCS faxing subsystem is a
custom Perl script wrapped around the
<span   class="bold"><b>efax07a</b></span> package, a virtual X
server, a few Netscape &ldquo;-remote&rdquo; commands and Ghostscript. The
result is the ability to fax any URSG Daily Operations Control
System report directly to any fax machine in the world, just by
clicking on that button.</p><p>United's Omaha office grew to the point that dedicated T1
connectivity was deemed necessary. A Linux server was installed in
that office in December 1996. The custom file retrieval and archive
commit program now runs in Omaha as well. Furthermore,
<span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> (Secure Shell) is used to move
those files automatically to the main server in
Jacksonville.</p><p>We ran across a great deal on some DEC Alpha UDBs (universal
desktop box) and initially picked up four of them for United. Red
Hat Alpha Linux allowed us to spread some of the server tasks
across those boxes. The URSG Daily Operations Control System was
moved to alpha2, for example. Alpha4 was assigned the role of
running the old 26GB magneto-optical jukebox which had been
collecting dust for a few months. By wrapping our own custom backup
scripts around Gerd Knorr's jukebox disk-changer package, we have
almost eliminated the need for United to perform tape-based
backups. Better yet, nightly incrementals of everything imaginable
happen automatically to mid-line storage. Detailed reports of what
was backed up, what incrementals were pruned due to age, and the
disk-usage status of everything are waiting for the system
administrators each morning.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcc6580.0xdbf318"></a>Linux On The Desktop</h2></div></div><p>As United continues to grow and the employee count rises,
additional desktop computers are continuously needed. Having worked
at places like the Supercomputer Computations Research Institute on
the campus of Florida State University, where four system
administrators support hundreds of Unix users (a large percentage
through X Terminals), we knew that an X Terminal model would work
for United. We began installing Linux-based X Terminals everywhere
new desktop computers were needed. We are able to sell United new
Alphas with 32MB of RAM, 15 inch monitors and no hard disks for
$1000US each. This is a much cheaper alternative to deploying new
Windows 95 boxes considering the cost of hardware, software, setup
time and recurring maintenance. The hardware was also cheaper, and
in our opinion better than even the dedicated X Terminal/Network
Computer equipment that we originally investigated for this
task.</p><p>The Linux/Alpha X Terminals boot over the network, NFS mount
their root and usr file systems, and then open an
<span   class="bold"><b>xdm</b></span> (X window manager) session on
an XDMCP server. The window manager chosen for United's X Terminals
was FVWM95. The engineers who have received these X Terminals
rarely use MS Office type applications&mdash;Applixware is used to fill
that occasional need. Netscape Navigator is used to access the
URSGDOCS and Internet e-mail.</p><p><a href="2302f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
ApplixWord on X Terminal</b></span></a></p><p>The X Terminal model is working well. All of URSG's engineers
have migrated to X Terminals. This has allowed United to continue
to extend the useful lifespan of aging 386/486 class equipment by
redeploying it in both X terminal and fat-client capacities in the
wiring facilites and branch offices.</p><p>Our calculations show significant cost savings through
utilizing slightly higher-end Linux-based X Terminals with fast
Ethernet in place of the FAT- client CAD stations that United
currently uses and deploys. PCC was a beta test site for Bentley's
port of Microstation 95 to Linux. The port seemed flawless and was
very promising; an academic release version has been shipping for
several months. However, Bentley has not yet received the level of
demand from Linux users that it deems necessary to support
Microstation commercially on the Linux platform. We plan to
continue to work with Bentley and to encourage the commercial
release and support of Microstation for Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcc6580.0xdbf688"></a>More Recent Projects</h2></div></div><p>An NCD Wincenter Multiuser NT server has been installed at
URSG and more Alpha X Terminals deployed. Even administrative staff
now have Linux-based X terminals on their desk. These staffers use
Linux Netscape for Inter/Intranet access and e-mail, and they run
office productivity applications (accounting, MS Word, MS Excel,
etc.) on the Multiuser NT server.</p><p>URSG's Jacksonville wiring facility has moved to a new
location, tripled in size, and had its connectivity to the
main-office LAN upgraded from the 128K ISDN mentioned earlier to a
1.536MB T1.</p><p>PCC has added enhanced extranet functionality to URSGDOCS
including a system designed specifically for use by CSX
Transportation and all of its railway signal design contractors.
This particular extranet section of URSGDOCS allows fast and well
documented business transactions between CSX Transportation and its
signal design contractors. The system allows contractors to make
requests for circuit plans and CAD files, CSXT staffers fulfill
those requests by uploading CAD files into URSGDOCS, then
contractors can download those files. All transactions inside the
system generate e-mail notifications to appropriate persons and to
an e-mail alias that is used to archive all transactions. The
transactions archive is full-text searchable and browseable. The
system has been in operation since July 10, 1997 and averages
approximately 2000 transactions and 500MB of compressed CAD file
transfers per month.</p><p>As new systems and functionality have been added to URSGDOCS,
it has been migrated to a Dual 200MHz Pentium Pro Linux server with
128MB RAM. The ursgfS1 machine has been upgraded to a uni-processor
200MHz Pentium Pro Linux server with 64MB RAM. The Wincenter server
resides on Dual 150MHz Pentium Pro hardware with 128MB RAM.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcc6580.0xdbf898"></a>The Moral of the Story</h2></div></div><p>Unix, in particular Linux, combined with the GNU tools, can
change a company's technology spending focus allowing it to move
away from a larger, under-skilled IS staff to a smaller,
higher-skilled staff or to outsourcing. A move to either results in
a company receiving more reliable and more customized solutions
that can easily evolve to the company's changing needs over
time.</p><p>Yes, Linux means business. The work that we at Progressive
Computer Concepts have done with United Railway Signal Group is a
wonderful example.</p></div></div>
