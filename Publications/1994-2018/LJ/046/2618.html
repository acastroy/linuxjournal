Computer</em></span>] that I reviewed in November has recently been
discontinued in favor of the Fujitsu 700 series. I have been
assured by Fujitsu Technical Support that they will continue to
honor their warranties and support &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; systems such as
these. Anyone who succeeds in picking up one extra cheap can be
reasonably sure of support for the foreseeable future. Still, it's
a bit alarming that a six-month-old machine can be thought of as a
&ldquo;legacy&rdquo; system.

architecture by Phil Hughes just days before my <span   class="emphasis"><em>Embedded
Systems Programming</em></span> magazine arrived. In it was an
article by Larry Mittag describing I2O in some detail. He did
mention the NDA and license restrictions. He reported that the
reason for these restrictions is not the I2OSIG itself, but the
lawyers and owners of the software patents for this architecture.
Apparently, this architecture has been used before in mainframes
and the techniques were patented. Thus, it cannot be freely
implemented by others unless a license fee is paid.</p><p>For this reason, an e-mail campaign to I2OSIG will not be
successful. After all, they must comply with the law. However, it
sure would have been nice of them to communicate with
<i  >Linux Journal</i> to clarify the situation.</p><p>The League for Programming Freedom (http://www.lpf.org/) is
fighting to overturn the concept of software patents. This would
not prohibit programmers from copyrighting their code; it just
means that an idea&mdash;which is what an algorithm is&mdash;could not be
patented. Their belief and mine is that patents are for physical
devices and processes, not for mathematical algorithms.</p><p>The only way I see to create a unified driver environment is
for developers to refuse to use the I2O specification.</p><p>&mdash;Jeff Root</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e70580.0x1f685b0"></a>Noweb</h2></div></div><p>It was nice to see an article presenting noweb, one of my
favorite tools [<span   class="emphasis"><em>Literate Programming with
Noweb</em></span>, Andrew Johnson and Brad Johnson, October
1997].</p><p>Although the article did a good job of describing the
technical intricacies of creating a noweb-literate program, it did
not properly present the idea behind literate programming (LP), nor
did it convey the idea that LP can be used by serious software
developers. Noweb does not require that the source be in a single
file; my preference is to put each project component in a separate
directory and to use one noweb source file per subcomponent.</p><p>One of the key LP advantages is that the documentation is
next to the code, in the same file. Other LP tools that also
support multiple programming languages are nuweb and FunnelWeb;
check the LP FAQ.</p><p>Another noweb feature is that the tangled (extracted) code is
readable, indentation and line breaks are respected; therefore, the
tangled code can be distributed as if it were the actual
source.</p><p>Users unfamiliar with LaTeX might be pleased to know that
there are several noweb modes for Emacs (I wrote one of them), and
that with color highlighting the source file becomes quite
readable.</p><p>Those interested in LP applied to software engineering can
check the low traffic moderated newsgroup
comp.programming.literate, and the following books: Knuth's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Stanford GraphBase</em></span> (Addison Wesley 1993),
Fraser and Hanson's <span   class="emphasis"><em>A Retargetable C Compiler: Design and
Implementation</em></span> (Benjamin/Cummings 1995) and Hanson's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>C Interfaces and Implementations</em></span> (Addison
Wesley 1997).</p><p>Noweb works perfectly under Linux (or any Unix variant) and
there are also versions for Windows 95. Wouldn't it be nice if the
full Linux kernel sources were available in noweb format and
published as a book? After merging with the Kernel Hacker's Guide
it could be used in Operating System courses and perhaps become the
next standard format for kernel sources.</p><p>&mdash;Alexandre Valente Sousa avs@ismai.pt</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e70580.0x1f68a80"></a>Comments on <i  >LJ</i> issue 43</h2></div></div><p>I was looking forward to receiving my copy of <i  >Linux Journal</i> Issue 43 (November 1997). After checking the
<i  >LJ</i> web site I was drooling about reading of
the GIMP and faxing from Macs. However, when my copy arrived I was
disappointed at seeing no examples of the GIMP in use. How on earth
can you cover a graphics program without any graphics? Sadly, this
article seems to have set a precedent as the later article on
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux as a Telephony Platform</em></span> by David Sugar
was also without any illustrations. I hope that this trend does not
continue.</p><p>Our office FAX machine is antiquated and in need of
replacement with something that we can use from our desktop Macs.
So I was also expecting good things in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Faxing From a Web
Page</em></span> (using HylaFAX on the Mac) by David Weis, but sadly
the short article did not address the issues in any depth. An
example of the web page used would have been preferable to
reproducing just the HylaFAX logo.</p><p>They say that if you're going to criticize something or
someone then you have to make three positive comments. First, the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Means Business</em></span> article
[<span   class="emphasis"><em>Highway POS System</em></span>, Marc L. Allen] was
interesting to read. I've worked on EPOS systems so I know some of
the pitfalls especially when trying to use MS-DOS machines.
Although short, this article did capture the author's obvious
enthusiasm for Linux. This series of articles has always been
inspiring and thought provoking. Second, the update on IP
Masquerading was very helpful. Keeping up to date with all that is
happening with Linux kernel issues is not easy, so this article was
a timely reminder of what is actually happening. (It also had some
illustrations, examples and figures to support the text.) Third,
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Take Command, ssh: Secure Shell</em></span>
[Alessandro Rubini] article also served as a timely reminder to be
careful out there.</p><p>&mdash;Trevor Jenkins Trevor.Jenkins@suneidesis.com</p><p>Three negatives and three positives&mdash;a well-balanced letter.
Michael sent in a very long article on the GIMP that just wouldn't
fit in one issue, so we requested that he split it into four parts.
Our November cover was built with the GIMP and used the graphic
that went with this first purely introductory article. We always
request graphics and images to go along with articles, but it
doesn't always work out&mdash;this was the case with the two other
articles you mention.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e70580.0x1f68fa8"></a>November Issue</h2></div></div><p>I have every issue of the <i  >Linux Journal</i>.
The issues vary from good to great, which is really just another
way of saying that the subject matter of some issues is of more
interest to me than others. However, with the November issue, you
outdid yourself. I am not sure I can complete it before the
December issue arrives. Every article and column was worth a read
and then a re-read. Excellent, keep up the good work.</p><p>&mdash;Richard Parry rparry@qualcomm.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e70580.0x1f69160"></a>Newbie</h2></div></div><p>Please allow me to describe my feelings about all of this:
Linux is over my head.</p><p>I'm no slouch when it comes to computers. I'm freshly
trained, and now on my own as a system administrator with a few
Suns, an SGI, an Intergraph and 1 PC (Win95) on a subnet. While my
knowledge base may be limited, I'm catching up rapidly. I'm also
not a programmer, nor is anyone I work with&mdash;they are all just
operators. So, hacking a kernel, writing code and everything else
that seems to be necessary to use Linux at home is beyond my
capabilities and those of most people I know.</p><p>I like the Unix environment at work and would love to have
the same control at home. As long as I could do on Linux the simple
stuff I enjoy on a Windows machine, I'd be happy. Things like surf
the web, balance my checkbook, pay bills and e-mail my parents. I
know I could if I could only code, but I can't; so, Linux doesn't
seem to be for me. Until it is accessible to people like me, the
vendors who support Linux will never make the money that that
&ldquo;other&rdquo; OS does.</p><p>&mdash;Searoy@aol.com</p><p>More and more applications are being written to make Linux
more accessible to the average user. E-mail can be done through
your ISP using Eudora or other mail programs. Surfing the web has
been available for some time. The majority of web servers are
Apache servers running on Linux boxes, and there are many browsers
that work with Linux&mdash;even Netscape. Applixware and StarOffice take
care of word processing and other office needs. Databases abound as
this issue proves. Check it all out&mdash;it may be easier than you
think.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e70580.0x1f693c8"></a>MagicFilter</h2></div></div><p>I have been getting <i  >Linux Journal</i> since
the first issue, and it has always been a great resource. Although
I have twenty years experience with Unix and systems work, I still
have days like last Tuesday. All I wanted to do was move my printer
to a new machine that had a new version of Slackware. I spent all
day and never got it working. Arggghhhh! Yesterday, my new
<i  >LJ</i> [November 1997] came in, I read Bill
Cunningham's article <span   class="emphasis"><em>Power Printing with
MagicFilter</em></span> last night, came to work this morning and
got the printer up and running in no time. Thanks again for the
right article at the right time.</p><p>&mdash;Dennis Director dennis@is3.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e70580.0x1f69630"></a>November cover</h2></div></div><p>I just wanted to comment on the November 1997 cover of

India feels a terrible urge to let you know that he thinks
<i  >LJ</i> #43 (November 1997) is a great
issue.</p><p>I am a Linux user who has had to get things the hard way.
When I started (with an SLS distribution on diskettes), Linux was
unheard of here in India. As times went by, its popularity grew,
but resources were hard to find&mdash;no Internet in India until 1995
was one of the main problems.</p><p>I subscribed to <i  >LJ</i>, and bless you guys
every day (I am a datacomm consultant for huge multinational
corporations operating in India and Linux is my main battle
axe).</p><p>In the past two years, India's #1 computer magazine
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>PC Quest</em></span>,http://www.pcquest.com/) has
distributed Linux on its cover CDs twice. This has helped the
number of Linux users in India shoot up in a near vertical fashion.
India has always been known as &ldquo;Unix country&rdquo;; since we have the
world's largest pool of technically-qualified, English-speaking
professionals, knowledge of any kind of Unix is a major plus point
when one goes job hunting. Many kids are now playing with Linux,
which gives them a huge edge when their time comes to pass out
resumes.</p><p>Unfortunately, <i  >LJ</i> is not a &ldquo;stand-mag&rdquo;
around here, and no local subscription points is another problem
(subscribing in US$ is a major pain here). It would be great if you
guys could tie up with someone in India, so that more people could
get the point. Here, as in many countries, a field/application/OS
is treated as <span   class="emphasis"><em>serious</em></span> only if it has
publications associated with it.</p><p>Keep up the good work. You have an excellent magazine, and
your work for the Linux cause is not going unnoticed&mdash;even here in
far-away India.</p><p>&mdash;Atul Chitnis achitnis@cbconsulting.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e70580.0x1f605a0"></a>Imagine1 URL</h2></div></div><p>The URL for downloading the free Linux F compiler from

issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>He offered four suggestions that would make Linux a better
solution. Two of them were application programs or packages. I
agree that creating new applications would be useful, but I'm also
concerned with existing Unix freeware that has yet to be ported or
compiled on Linux. There is a huge amount of this freeware
available but getting it to build on a Linux box is something else
again.</p><p>What is needed is a software porting project: a central site
to collect information about porting specific applications to
Linux. Information such as what changes are needed in the makefile,
imakefile or prog.tmpl to get the program to compile. Additionally,
information about the problems encountered in trying to compile the
app would be very useful. This kind of information would help
others who are trying to port applications to Linux. So, the site
would be a learning resource as well, and this is perhaps most
important.</p><p>As the knowledge and ability to port software to Linux
increases, the number of applications ported will increase at a
faster rate. The site wouldn't need to archive binaries or source
code, just the specifics about how to compile and the problems
encountered. In addition, it would be useful to include information
on who's currently working on which application. This would allow
communication between groups or individuals working on the same
problem and prevent duplication of effort. More applications will
make Linux a better solution, and the easiest way to get them is to
port existing Unix freeware. A dedicated site would greatly
facilitate the endeavor by effectively harnessing the knowledge and
ability of the Linux community.</p><p>&mdash;George Timmons gwtim@2xtreme.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e70580.0x1f60a70"></a>vi, most used text editor</h2></div></div><p>First of all, let me tell you how much I appreciate
<i  >LJ</i>, for the accuracy of the information it
gives and the nice tone it uses.</p><p>I write you in reaction to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>1997 Readers' Choice
Award</em></span> that the text editor
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> received in the December issue.
I'm an old addict of this program, and I still find it fast and
useful. But I have always promised myself that I would learn Emacs
one of these days, thinking I couldn't remain an old dinosaur using
such an old tool. The problem is that I always found Emacs far too
complicated. So when I saw the Award, I was genuinely surprised so
many people think like me and I had a good laugh.</p><p>In short, after reading <i  >LJ</i>, I decided
that, despite vi being an old and ugly editor, I'll keep using it
without any remorse for being an Emacs loser.</p><p>&mdash;Pierre-Philippe Coupard coupard@mipnet.fr</p></div></div>
