    Mr. Lerner shows us a way to use file elements to allow web
    site visitors to upload information or program files to the
    site.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1672580.0x176a500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Here's a relatively easy question for
anyone who has been working with the Web for a while: How would you
allow visitors to your site to send you their name and address? The
easiest solution would be to use an HTML form containing one or
more text fields. The contents of the form would be sent to a CGI
program on the site's server, which would retrieve the fields'
contents.
</p><p>What if we were interested in sending more than just a few
words or phrases? What if we were interested in allowing visitors
to our site to enter large volumes of text? We could use a
&lt;textarea&gt; tag, which gives the user much more room in which
to write. But &lt;textarea&gt; elements, like all HTML form
elements, are still a bit clunky. Wouldn't it be nice if there were
a way to simply attach a file to an HTML form, much as we can
attach files to e-mail messages?</p><p>Using the relatively unknown file element, we can do just
that. File elements are in many ways similar to text and hidden
elements, in that they contain strings of text, rather than simple
on-off indicators (as with check boxes) or one of a number of
possible strings (as with radio buttons and selection lists). In
addition to sending the name of the file, file elements send the
contents of the file along with the HTML form.</p><p>Before we get to some practical uses for the file element,
let's look at a simple example of what is possible. Our initial
form shown in <a href="2648l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> contains a
single file element and a submit button. It is similar to forms
that we have seen in previous installments of <span   class="emphasis"><em>At the
Forge</em></span> and is probably quite similar to forms that you
have seen on other web sites. The form begins with a
<b  >&lt;form&gt;</b> tag indicating the method that
should be used when sending the data (<b  >POST</b>) and
the CGI program to which the data is to be sent
(/cgi-bin/upload-file.pl). We then have a single form element, as
well as a &ldquo;submit&rdquo; button for sending the data.</p><p>There are two differences between this form and the forms
that we have seen before. For starters, the form element has a
third attribute (<b  >ENCTYPE</b>) that we can generally
ignore, because the default value
(<b  >application/x-www-form-urlencoded</b>) is
sufficient for most purposes. However, URL-encoding (in which
characters are replaced by a percent sign followed by their ASCII
code in hexadecimal, e.g., the space character becomes %20) is
inefficient when used on large files, particularly when those files
contain a large number of characters that require the coding. In
addition, we want to separate the form elements from the file (or
files) being uploaded, and we want to tag the uploaded file with a
MIME-style content-type header indicating the type of data that is
being sent.</p><p>For all of these reasons, using the form element requires the
use of a new ENCTYPE setting (one defined in RFC 1867 available on
the Web at http://www.internic.net/):
<b  >multipart/form-data</b>. With this encoding type,
the contents of each uploaded file will be sent separately, without
URL-encoding and with a &ldquo;Content-type&rdquo; header describing the type
of data contained within. Aside from having to remember to set the
encoding type explicitly at the top of any forms containing file
elements, we do not have to worry too much about the way in which
files are submitted to our CGI programs.</p><p>The other new element in the above form is the file element
itself. When presented in HTML source code, a file element appears
to be quite similar to a &ldquo;text&rdquo; element. We assign it a name, and
the value will presumably come from the user.</p><p>The file element is different from other elements in two
ways. First of all, it tells the user's browser to send not just
the file name specified in the file element, but also the contents
of the file associated with that name.</p><p>More obvious to the user, however, is the fact that a file
element appears in the user's browser as the combination of a text
field and a button. The user can enter a filename by typing into
the text field, or&mdash;and this is the unusual part&mdash;she can browse
through the file system using a dialog box brought up by the
&ldquo;browse&rdquo; button. When the user selects a file to upload by using
the &ldquo;browse&rdquo; button, the name of the file is entered into the
text field, as if the user had typed it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1672580.0x176ab30"></a>Receiving the File</h2></div></div><p>Now that we know how to set up the form for uploading files,
let's look at a small CGI program that will accept the file that
was uploaded. For starters in <a href="2648l2.html" target="_self">Listing
2</a> we will simply have our program print the uploaded file
on the screen.</p><p>Let's run through this program, in case you aren't completely
familiar with CGI programs written in Perl. First of all, we start
up Perl with the <b  >-w</b> flag to warn us if we are
doing something particularly stupid. We also turn on diagnostics so
that Perl will give us a verbose error message if and when it
detects an error.</p><p>Normally, any program I write includes the line <b  >use
strict</b> to catch potentially dangerous or foolish
constructs that I might have built. However, as you will see, we
will be playing some games with references later on, and we must
turn off the strict package when dealing with references so that
our program does not crash. Immediately after importing the
&ldquo;strict&rdquo; module, we thus turn off strict checking on references
by using the &ldquo;no&rdquo; pragma (a construct for telling Perl how to
handle your program).</p><p>Then, we load CGI.pm, the package that takes care of most of
the dirty work for CGI programs. We create an instance of CGI and
use the &ldquo;header&rdquo; method to send an initial MIME-style header to
the user's browser, indicating that we will be sending HTML-encoded
text in our response.</p><p>Next, we retrieve the value of the file name entered by the
user from the form element named <b  >userfile</b> and
put it into a variable named <b  >$userfile</b>. Until
now, <b  >$userfile</b> could have come from a text or
hidden element as easily as from a form element.</p><p>Now comes the wild part. We use <b  >$username</b>
as a file handle, and iterate over it using the
<b  >&lt;&gt;</b> operator to retrieve the contents of
the file. I must admit that when I first wrote programs that took
advantage of uploading files, I was floored&mdash;could I really use the
variable that I had assigned as a file handle? The answer is that
it does indeed work rather well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1672580.0x176b0b0"></a>Checking the Uploaded File's Type</h2></div></div><p>There is at least one problem with our program. What happens
if the user uploads a GIF or JPEG image? We will end up displaying
a good deal of garbage on the user's screen, since the image will
be sent and then displayed as if it were HTML.</p><p>One solution is to use the <b  >accept</b>
attribute that can be used with the file element. In theory,
<b  >accept</b> should be set to one or more file types
that the user should be allowed to send via the form. Thus, if we
were only interested in receiving HTML files, we could say:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;P&gt;File to upload: &lt;INPUT NAME="userfile"
        TYPE="file" value=""
        accept="*.html"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
</pre><p>This statement would restrict the user to uploading files
with the .html extension, which would presumably be HTML files. In
practice, I have found that while the <b  >accept</b>
setting changes the filter in the window brought up by the browse
button, the <b  >accept</b> setting is not enforced, and
users can enter whatever they might like in the text field.
</p><p>If we are truly interested in ensuring that only HTML files
are uploaded to our program, we need to modify our CGI program such
that it checks the Content-type header of a file before displaying
it. If the file has a Content-type of <b  >text/html</b>,
it is considered acceptable and printed; if not, a short error
message is displayed.</p><p>We can check the headers associated with a file by calling
<span   class="bold"><b>uploadInfo</b></span> on the file name
($userfile), which returns a reference to a hash, which in turn
contains all of the headers associated with a particular file.
<a href="2648l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a> is a slightly modified
version of our previous program which prints the headers before the
file.</p><p>Once we have retrieved the headers as shown in Listing 3, it
becomes relatively easy to receive only certain kinds of files. We
could, for instance, add the following lines to our program to
ensure that uploaded files have a Content-type of
<b  >text/html</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if ($headers{"Content-Type"} ne "text/html")
        {
        print "&lt;P&gt;Sorry, only HTML files.&lt;/P&gt;\n";
        exit;
        }
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1672580.0x176b6e0"></a>Doing Something with the File</h2></div></div><p>Uploading files is fine and dandy, but the point of uploading
files is to use them, not simply display them on the screen for
users to see. Now that we have seen how to upload a program from
the user's browser to a CGI program running on our Web server,
let's try to use this program for something practical.</p><p>Let's take a simple example, one which comes from a program
that I wrote for a site. Our site sat on a server rented from a web
space provider, meaning that while we had control over our
individual HTML files and CGI programs, system administration
(including user names) was controlled by the company from which we
rented the space.</p><p>The problem began when those of us working on the site
decided that we wished to allow members of various affiliated
organizations and subgroups to add HTML files within particular
directories. That is, we created a directory for each group
affiliated with our site, and expected that each group would be
able to add and modify HTML files as necessary.</p><p>However, we only had a single login for our site, and we
certainly didn't wish to jeopardize the site's security by giving
out that user name and password to each of the 40 or 50 affiliated
organizations. At the same time, given that each organization would
change no more than ten HTML files in a given month, it seemed an
extreme and costly measure to order user names for each
group.</p><p>We finally decided to allow users to upload files into their
organization's directory&mdash;and only into that directory&mdash;using an
HTML form similar to the one we saw above. Whereas the above form
only requested that the user enter a file name (either by typing it
in directly or by clicking on the browse button), we now asked for
three additional pieces of information: the directory into which
the file should be deposited, the name that the file should be
given once it reaches that directory and the password for that
directory.</p><p>We ask for a directory name and password to ensure that users
only deposit files into the directory for which they have been
given permission by the system administrators. Passwords are not a
perfect security system, but they work relatively well, are
portable and are easy to understand. In this way, members of group
A can upload into the A directory and members of group B can upload
into the B directory, and both groups can be sure that no one else
is modifying the files in their directory.</p><p>One possible version of the HTML form that could be used to
upload files to a CGI program is in
<a href="2648l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a>. Notice that in that
file, I have used HTML tables to separate elements. That choice was
made for purely aesthetic reasons, so that each of the form
elements would line up with one another.</p><p>When the user enters a file name, directory name, password
and destination name in the form and clicks on the &ldquo;Upload file&rdquo;
button, the four form elements are sent to the CGI program
(/cgi-bin/upload-file.pl) along with the contents of the file named
in the file element, named userfile. We want to write a program
that takes the contents of userfile and saves it in the appropriate
directory (the section element) with the appropriate name (the file
name element). Of course, all of this happens only if the user
enters the correct password for that section.</p><p>Writing a program that does this sounds pretty
straightforward, right? Well, it is; take a look at
<a href="2648l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a> to see what a basic
version might look like.</p><p>The password system in this program is a simple hash whose
keys are the different sections and whose values are the passwords
for those sections. If you have a small number of sections on your
site, you can set the passwords within the program , as shown in
Listing 5.</p><p>Even though it is easy to add new sections and passwords in
this way, it is not a good idea for you to modify the source code
for something this simple. It is a good idea to put password
information in a text file, a DBM-style file (which is basically a
hash saved to disk), or even a small SQL database (as we saw in a
series of <span   class="emphasis"><em>At the Forge</em></span> installments earlier
this year). Then again, if the number of sections is small and
doesn't change very often, you might simply stick with the example
system displayed here.</p><p>In order to ensure that users do not abuse the uploading
system, we remove everything in the uploaded file name up to and
including the first slash. This makes it rather difficult for
someone to try to deposit one of their files in someone else's
directory by taking advantage of the &ldquo;..&rdquo; directory name, an
option that means &ldquo;use this directory's parent&rdquo;.</p><p>After checking to make sure that we have received all of the
required information, we compare the correct password with what the
user entered:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&amp;log_and_die("Incorrect password")
        unless ($PASSWORD{$section} eq $password);
</pre><p>Now that we have established that we have all of the needed
information and that the user is authorized, we save the file to
disk using a simple &ldquo;while&rdquo; loop that reads from $userfile (which
can be treated as a file handle) and printing to FILE, the handle
that we created for saving information to disk in Listing 5:
<pre     class="programlisting">
open (FILE, "&gt;$saved_filename") || &amp;log_and_die(
           "Cannot write to $saved_filename: $! ");
        while (&lt;$userfile&gt;)
        {
        print FILE;
        }
close (FILE);
</pre>


Finally, let's look at <span   class="bold"><b>log_and_die</b></span>
shown at the end of Listing 5, a subroutine I include in many CGI
programs, which allows us to die relatively gracefully with a
reasonable message sent to the user and the error log. This is a
far better way for the program to crash than producing the
unfriendly &ldquo;500 Server error&rdquo; message that is all too common on
web sites these days.
</p><p>When we execute statements such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
open (FILE, "&gt;$saved_filename") || &amp;log_and_die(
        "Cannot write to $saved_filename: $! ");
</pre><p>we are saying, &ldquo;Open the file $saved_filename for writing,
and allow me to write to $saved_filename using the FILE file
handle. But if you cannot open the file, send a message to the user
indicating that you cannot open it, along with $!, Perl's special
variable containing the most recent error message.&rdquo; Not only is
this message better for visitors to your site, it can be more
useful to you when debugging your program.
</p><p>There are a few drawbacks to this program that deserve
mention. The lack of an intelligent backup system (which would be
relatively easy to add), the inability to deal with subdirectories
(useful when you want to separate images from text) and a fairly
primitive user interface are all strikes against this system. But
over time, this has proved to be a good compromise between
insecurity (i.e., giving everyone affiliated with the site access
via the same user name and password) and expense (i.e., buying a
new account for each affiliated group, even though the accounts
will rarely be used).</p><p>The file tag is not something that you will use every day,
but when you need to allow users to upload information to your
server, it can be quite handy.</p></div></div>
