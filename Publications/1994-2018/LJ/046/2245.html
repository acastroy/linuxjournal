for general use is the availability of office applications. Besides
text-processing, spreadsheets and graphic applications, databases
are an important part of this type of application. Until now, the
big players in the database market like Sybase and Oracle haven't
released a Linux version of their products; nevertheless, there are
several database packages available for Linux, mostly commercial
applications. There is one database which deserves special
attention, because it is now developed similarly to Linux. This
database is PostgreSQL, formerly known as Postgres95. Last October,
version 6.2.1 was published, and this is a good time to take a
closer look at this project.
</p><p>PostgreSQL has a long history beginning in the year 1986 when
Michael Stonebraker began its development as a successor to the
Ingres database system. The main goal of his project was to show
that a relational database system could cope with modern demands of
extensibility as well as an object-oriented system. The resulting
product was called an object-relational database because it was a
relational database system with some object-oriented features such
as inheritance and user-defined functions, operators and access
methods. In 1994, with the release of version 4.2, the work on
Postgres stopped because Stonebraker's project ended. However, some
staff members decided to continue with their work and in 1995
released Postgres95 with SQL as the query language rather than
PostQuel. Now the development is carried on under the name
PostgreSQL by a team of volunteers on the Internet, coordinated by
Marc G. Fournier.</p><p>The package is not released under the GPL. It has its own
license that allows the distribution of modified releases even
without source code, as long as the copyright notice remains
untouched.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x268c580.0x27845b0"></a>Features of PostgreSQL</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Client/Server Database for a multi-user

systems familiar to users of MS-DOS and Windows machines. It is not
sufficient to start only one program to work with the database.
There are at least three different applications running
simultaneously. One is the server, which in PostgreSQL is called
the postmaster. It is a daemon which observes a TCP port (usually
port 5432) for a connection from the second: a user client. This
user client could be <span   class="bold"><b>psql</b></span>, a
command-line tool for sending SQL queries that comes with
PostgreSQL, or specialized applications, like a CGI program that
wishes to store data gathered from an HTML form. Once a client
connects, the postmaster starts the third application: the back-end
server. This is the actual database engine, because only the
back-end server has direct access to the stored records of the
database. The postmaster connects the client with the back-end
server and then waits for other connections. In the meantime, the
client sends its queries to the back-end and receives its reply,
usually a lot of data. When the client has no other query, the
connection drops and the back-end server exits.</p><p>The consequence of this procedure is that the client, the
program that the user works with, has no direct access to the
database. It doesn't know how many records the back end sends in
response to a query. It doesn't know if the inserted data were
successfully processed, unless the back end signals success.
Therefore, fancy table editors such as those in dBase or Access are
difficult to implement and don't currently exist.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x268c580.0x2784f50"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>The installation of PostgreSQL is a little tedious at
present, but it becomes easier with every release. Version 6.2.1
comes with configure-support and detailed and comprehensive
installation instructions with specific notes for Linux. I will
mention some possible pitfalls during the installation process.
Make sure you have a recent version of
<span   class="bold"><b>flex</b></span> installed on your system. In
particular v2.5.3 does not work with PostgreSQL whereas v2.5.2 and
v2.5.4 work fine. For the client psql, you need the developer
libraries from GNU Readline, which are not installed by default on
some Linux distributions.</p><p>On Linux, PostgreSQL is compiled with a shared library named
libpq.so, which is used by all client applications. You need to
make sure that the dynamic linker finds this library by adding the
directory $POSTGRESDIR/lib to the file ld.so.config. Especially
with older versions of ld-linux.so (e.g., v1.8.5), it is necessary
to also add this directory to the environment variable
LD_LIBRARY_PATH. I do this in my rc.local file, which starts up the
postmaster, so it looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo "starting PostgreSQL postmaster..."
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/lib/pgsql/lib
su postgres -c "postmaster -D/opt/lib/pgsql/data \
-d 1 &amp;&gt; /opt/lib/pgsql/postmaster.log &amp;"
</pre><p>In the contrib/linux directory of the source distribution, a
more sophisticated startup script named postgres.init can be found,
that integrates the postmaster startup into the RedHat runlevel
system.
</p><p>Before starting the postmaster, edit the file pg_hba.conf in
the data directory. This file holds information, indicating which
hosts and users are allowed to connect to the database back end.
The minimal file necessary for local operation is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# TYPE  DATABASE  IP_ADDRESS  MASK       USERAUTH  MAP
  host   all      127.0.0.1   255.255.255.255   trust
# The above allows any user on the local system to
# connect to any database under any user name.
</pre><p>As mentioned in the documentation, it is essential not to
start the postmaster as root, but rather to start it in a special
postgres user ID.
</p><p>For clients to work, they must know where to find the
databases. Therefore, you have to set the environment variables
PGDATA and PGLIB for every user. I do it in /etc/profile.
Additionally, every user who should have access to PostgreSQL needs
to have appropriate access permissions in the system databases.
This is done with the <span   class="bold"><b>createuser</b></span>
program, run by the postgres account.
<span   class="bold"><b>createuser</b></span> offers you the option
of giving the user the right to create databases and/or the right
to add other users. It is possible to say no to both questions,
thus giving the user access only to the existing databases. If you
are running PostgreSQL as a WWW database back end, you must set
access permissions for the user ID of the web server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x268c580.0x27853c8"></a>Short Introduction to SQL</h2></div></div><p>The best way to get started with PostgreSQL is to read the
user manual. It is written for Postgres95 v1.0 and dates back to
September 1995, but the information provided there is still useful.
Other valuable sources of information are the tutorials, the man
pages and the various files in the /doc directory. I will be using
the examples from the tutorial in this article whenever
possible.</p><p>To begin, create a database, i.e., a named container for
several tables and accompanying data such as indices and views. To
use the database named tutorial, type this command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
createdb tutorial
</pre><p>Now, you are automatically the owner of the database and have
full access to it. Other users have access only if you grant them
the appropriate rights.
</p><p>Next, connect that database to a client program. We will use
psql, which comes with PostgreSQL. If you prefer a graphical
interface, there is also a Motif client available called
<span   class="bold"><b>mpsql</b></span> (with pre-compiled binaries
for Linux). <span   class="bold"><b>mpsql</b></span> has great
editing capabilities but doesn't provide special local commands for
listing existing tables and databases. It also lacks a help system
that is available in psql. To use psql, type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
psql tutorial
</pre><p>This command provides you with a shell-like environment in
which you can issue SQL commands. Due to the Readline support, you
have command history and file name completion with the same key
bindings as the bash shell. You can also enter local commands which
are processed by the client first if you prefix them with a
backslash. Enter <b  >\?</b> to get a list of local
commands. All other commands are sent directly to the back end.
Commands can be typed on separate lines. They will be stored in a
local buffer until you enter a line terminated with a
<b  >;</b> (semicolon), then the buffer is sent to the
back end. Help on SQL commands is available by typing
<b  >\h</b>.
</p><p>SQL commands can be passed on the command line for shell
scripting. The <b  >\i</b> command reads a file from disk
and executes its contents as SQL commands. Be sure to always use
absolute pathnames with psql, because the back end knows nothing
about the current working directory of the client.</p><p>Next, create the following two tables:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
create table cities (
  name  text,
  population    float8,
  altitude      int--this is a comment
);
create table capitals (
  state char2
) inherits (cities);
</pre><p>The text type is a string of characters of variable length.
If you enter <b  >int</b>, you get a four-byte integer
value. PostgreSQL comes with 43 predefined data types including
several types for time and date values, many types for geometrical
objects such as point, circle and polygon and a boolean type.
Arrays are also supported. All types are described in the
pgbuiltin(l) manual page. If you need additional types, you can add
your own. Note that identifier names have not been case sensitive
since v6.1.
</p><p>This example also illustrates a special feature of
PostgreSQL: object inheritance. The second table inherits all the
fields from the cities table and adds one more field. Later I'll
show how to take advantage of that feature.</p><p>One often needed feature is missing from PostgreSQL, that is,
the ability to define primary keys in the create clause. Primary
keys are used to define a default sort order for the tuples and to
ensure that the field with that key can't hold duplicate values. It
is not supported due to the method used to store the records (or
tuples). Every tuple in the database gets a unique object
identifier (oid) value, which is unique not only in the table but
also in the whole database. There is no way to guarantee a specific
order in the table. As of version 6.0 of PostgreSQL it is possible
to create a unique index, so that the same effect can be achieved
with indices. To create a unique index for our example table,
type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
create unique index on cities
using btree (name);
</pre><p>There are three methods available for index creation: btree,
rtree and hash. The method can be specified after the keyword
&ldquo;using&rdquo;. Only the btree method allows multiple key indices with
up to seven keys. Note that not all data types are supported by all
index types. In particular, rtree indices are available only for
geometric types. If no index type is specified, btree is used as
the default. Indices increase the access speed to tables
significantly and should be used whenever possible.
</p><p>The maximum size of a tuple is 8192 bytes. In reality, it is
somewhat smaller, because PostgreSQL needs some place for storing
internal data. The amount of this space varies from platform to
platform. If you need larger fields, use the large objects
interface, which provides unlimited fields of transparent data,
like MEMO or BLOB fields in other databases; however, you need
special functions to access them.</p><p>To enter data in the tables, use the
<span   class="bold"><b>insert</b></span> command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO cities VALUES ('San Francisco',
        7.24E+5, 63);
INSERT INTO cities VALUES ('Las Vegas', 2.583E+5,
        2174);
INSERT INTO cities VALUES ('Mariposa', 1200,
        1953);
INSERT INTO capitals VALUES ('Sacramento',
        3.694E+5, 30, 'CA');
INSERT INTO capitals VALUES ('Madison', 1.913E+5,
        845, 'WI');
</pre><p>To get the data out of the tables, use the
<span   class="bold"><b>select</b></span> command. It's a very
powerful command, so I will demonstrate only some of its
characteristics.
<pre     class="programlisting">
-- this will return all records in the table
select * from cities;
select * from capitals;
-- to get also the records of the
-- inherited tables, use this syntax:
select * from cities*;
-- here are some variants to limit the returned
-- data:
select name, altitude
from cities
where altitude &gt; 500;
</pre>


To change some values in the table, use the
<span   class="bold"><b>update command</b></span>, which has a
similar syntax as the select command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
update cities
-- population grows by 10%
set population = population * 1.1
where name = 'Mariposa';
</pre>


When you update your data regularly, you will notice that the
tables grow continuously, even if you haven't added new tuples.
This is not a bug&mdash;it's another special feature called time travel.
PostgreSQL keeps a history of all data changes in the table. To
access this data, you have to use a special qualifier:
<pre     class="programlisting">
select name, population
from cities['epoch', 'now']
where name = 'Mariposa';
</pre>


This example will list all the values of the two fields, name and
population of Mariposa, from the creation of the database up to the
present. If you don't wish to retain the history data, you can
delete it using the <span   class="bold"><b>vacuum</b></span>
command. In the future version 7.0, the time-travel feature will
vanish, but at this time you need to vacuum your databases
regularly. The vacuum command also has the additional purpose of
updating the internal data in order to make faster querys possible.
Therefore, it is a good idea to define a
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> job that runs vacuum every
night.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x268c580.0x2b7e278"></a>Time and Date Functions</h2></div></div><p>Time and date values are handled in a very flexible manner. I
will demonstrate this on a database that I use for tracking my
telephone costs for connecting to my Internet provider. The
structure of my database and a sample query look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
create table telephone (
 datum    abstime,
 online_secs int4,
 units    int2,
 costs    float8
);
select * from pppcosts
where datum &gt;= 'yesterday'::abstime;
datum                   |online_secs|units|cost
Tue Jul 08 00:16:22 1997 MET DST|  486|  3|0.36
Tue Jul 08 20:18:52 1997 MET DST| 1476| 10| 1.2
Wed Jul 09 01:06:33 1997 MET DST| 3317| 14|1.68
</pre><p>This query returns my on-line events from yesterday at
00:00:00 until now. The term
<b  >'yesterday'::abstime</b> is an explicit type
conversion that makes sure the parser gets the right type for
literal values. In this case it is not necessary, but sometimes the
input type might be guessed wrong and an error returned. Explicit
notation avoids such errors.
</p><p>It is also possible to get aggregates of data. From my
telephone costs table, I can get the costs for the last 30 days by
giving the following query:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
select sum(online_secs) as seconds,
    sum(units) as units,
    sum(costs) as costs
 where datum &gt; ('now'::abstime -
        '30 days'::reltime);
</pre><p>The keyword <b  >as</b> sets the column titles to
the specified values; otherwise, they would all read
<b  >sum</b>.
</p><p>Also supported is the SQL date type which accepts dates in
the form mm/dd/yyyy. There is even a mechanism to change the date
format for foreign languages (currently only European and US
formats are supported). Use the
<span   class="bold"><b>set</b></span> command as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
set datestyle to 'european';
set datestyle to 'us';
</pre><p>The date format is changed to dd/mm/yyyy and then back to
mm/dd/yyyy. In v6.1 a comma had to follow the keywords &ldquo;european&rdquo;
and &ldquo;us&rdquo;. In later releases this bug has been fixed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x268c580.0x2b7e7a0"></a>Sequences</h2></div></div><p>Another nifty feature is the sequence command. A frequent
demand to a database is that some column contains a sequence of
numbers which is automatically increased when new records are
added. To do this, create sequences by giving the following
statements:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
create sequence id start 1000 increment 10;
insert into table values (nextval(id),...);
</pre><p>This example will create a sequence, with the name ID, which
starts at 1000 and increases by 10 every time the function
<span   class="bold"><b>nextval()</b></span> returns a unique number.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x268c580.0x2b7e9b0"></a>User-Defined Functions</h2></div></div><p>The next example shows how to implement a user-defined
function. This technique can be used to overcome a limitation of
PostgreSQL&mdash;the database system is not able to process subqueries.
Querys that contain another query, usually in a where clause, are
called subquerys. PostgreSQL supports them only indirectly, i.e.,
when the subquery is hidden in a function.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
-- I will use the cities table again
create function big_city() returns set of cities
 as 'select * from cities* where population &gt; 700000'
 language 'sql';
select name(big_city()) as highpop;
</pre><p>In the example, the function returns a tuple from the cities
table. It is also possible to return only single values by writing
e.g., <b  >returns int4</b>. The language command in the
example tells the parser that this is a query-language function.
With programming-language functions (e.g., <b  >language
'c'</b>), you can program your own functions in C and load
them as dynamic modules directly into the back end. This mechanism
is also used to create user-defined types. (Examples can be found
in the tutorial directory of the source tree.) A function is
permanently stored in the same way as a table. So, when it is no
longer needed, it must be explicitly deleted by giving the
<b  >drop function</b> command.
</p><p>I have presented only some highlights of the SQL language
here, with an emphasis on special features of PostgreSQL. I also
omitted examples for joining data from different tables, for
creating views and for enclosing your operation in transaction
blocks to ensure that either all actions are performed or none at
all. I also omitted mentioning cursors, which allow you to limit
the amount of tuples returned from a query. These and other
features can be learned best from a book about the SQL query
language. I have used the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>A Visual Introduction to
SQL</em></span> from J.H. Trimble, D. Chappel and others, published
by Wiley in 1989 for my learning. It is aimed at novices and easy
to understand.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x268c580.0x2b7ed20"></a>Programming Interfaces</h2></div></div><p>One advantage of the long history of PostgreSQL is the
availability of many programming interfaces. An Interface for C,
C++, Perl5, Tcl and Java JDBC is shipped with the release. Also
available are packages for Python and Objective-C (the latter from
the GNUStep project). With these libraries you can develop your own
client applications.</p><p>The C-library is the basic interface to PostgreSQL, because
it is used by most of the other libraries. The best example for
using it is the psql client. If you are writing clients in C, this
program will teach you much of the internal working method of the
C-API.</p><p>I will now discuss a small program that writes all tuples
from the cities table to the screen. (Source code can be obtained
from ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue46/2245.tgz.)</p><p>The C-Interface is located in the libpq library. If you have
installed PostgreSQL properly, the linker should find the library.
Link your program with the <b  >-lpq</b> options set. In
the source code, you have to include the header files with the
line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#include &lt;libpq-fe.h&gt;
</pre><p>Make sure the compiler finds the header files; they are
usually located in the $POSTGRESDIR/include directory.
</p><p>The first step in the dialog with the back end is to
establish a connection to the database. This is done with the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
char* dbname;
strcpy(dbname, "tutorial");
conn = PQsetdb(host, port, options, tty, dbname);
</pre><p>All parameters are of type char*. If one is NULL, a default
value is used. Usually it is only necessary to specify the database
name and a hostname if it's not the local host. The function
returns a pointer, which must be used for further access to this
connection.
</p><p>To test the success of a PQsetdb operation the following code
can be used:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if (PQstatus(conn) == CONNECTION_BAD) {
 printf(stderr,
"Connection to database '%s' failed.\n", dbname);
 fprintf(stderr, "%s", PQerrorMessage(conn));
 PQfinish(conn);
 exit(1);
}
</pre><p>PQerrorMessage returns a detailed error message. With
PQfinish the connection is terminated and all internal buffers are
freed.
</p><p>After a successful connection, a query can be sent to the
database in this way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
result = PQexec(conn, "select * from cities");
if ((!result) || (PGRES_TUPLES_OK !=
               PQresultStatus(result))) {
  fprintf(stderr,
"Error sending query.\nDetailed report: %s\n",
PQerrorMessage(conn));
  PQfinish(conn);
  exit(1);
}
</pre><p>Again, the result of the operation has to be checked, now
with the function PQresultStatus which returns different codes
dependent on the database operation that is to be performed. In our
case, we expect to get some tuples back so we test against this
condition. Another possible value is PGRES_COMMAND_OK, which is
returned when a query such as INSERT was sent that returns no data.
The returning pointer points to a structure within the record data.
The structure could be very large. Don't try to access this
structure directly; use the functions of the libpq instead, because
the internal working methods of the library is subject to change.
As a demonstration, here is code that prints out the contents of
the cities database:
<pre     class="programlisting">
printf("name               population      altitude\n\n");
for (i = PQntuples(result)-1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {
 printf("%s        %s              %s\n", PQgetvalue(result,i,0),
 PQgetvalue(result,i,1), PQgetvalue(result,i,2));
}
</pre>


The function PQgetvalue returns the data as null-terminated ASCII
strings, regardless of the field type. To determine the field type,
the function PQftype could be used. This function is a weakness of
the library, because it returns only the internal coding of the
type which is difficult to handle. In order to interpret it
correctly, one has to know that all data types are stored as
separate tuples in the system database of PostgreSQL. The return
value of PQftype is the OID, the unique identifier, of that tuple.
To identify the type, you have to query the system database:
<pre     class="programlisting">
-- get the type with internal number 16 (bool)
select oid, typname from pg_type

that it is supported by PostgreSQL. The programming techniques are
very similar to the C-library; in fact, some object-oriented
interfaces make the programming simpler.</p><p>One such interface is the libpq++ library, written in C++ and
included in the distribution. It has undergone a major revision in
the v6.1 release. The class PgEnv is provided for manipulating the
environment such as setting the port number for connections and the
pathnames for the libraries and databases. The main class is
PgDatabase, used to establish a connection and execute querys. It
provides very convenient methods to make internal checks for
successful operation. There are also classes for accessing large
objects (PgLargeObject), for using transaction blocks
(PgTransaction) and for defining cursors (PgCursor). The libpq++ is
not built by default, you have to compile it with the provided
Makefile.</p><p>The Perl5 interface Pgsql_perl5 also must be compiled with
the Makefile. It provides two different interfaces. One is nearly
identical to libpq so that porting C applications to Perl is easy.
The other interface uses the object-oriented features of Perl5.
<a href="2245l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> demonstrates the use of
that interface. Its purpose is to give a listing of all users who
are owners of databases. To run this script, you need to have the
proper access rights in the system database. As you can see, with
the object-oriented interface, it is not necessary to close the
connection explicitly. The module handles this automatically when
the connection object is destroyed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x268c580.0x2b7f610"></a>PostgreSQL and the WWW</h2></div></div><p>Together with the Apache web server and some separately
available Apache modules, PostgreSQL can be used to serve databases
to the Web. One of these modules is mod_auth_pg95, which allows
user authentication with PostgreSQL databases. To make it work, you
have to install the web server with its own user and group ID
rather than with the default &ldquo;nouser&rdquo; and &ldquo;nogroup&rdquo;. This can
be done with the configuration statements
<span   class="bold"><b>User</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>Group</b></span> in the file httpd.conf. It
is then necessary to tell PostgreSQL of this account, so that it
accepts connections from the web server with
<span   class="bold"><b>createuser</b></span>. In the Apache
configuration file access.conf, you must tell the web server where
to find the authentication data. The following is a sample
configuration:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;Directory /DocumentRoot/MySecrets&gt;
Auth_PGhost localhost
Auth_PGport 5432
Auth_PGdatabase www
Auth_PGpwd_table apache_user
Auth_PGuid_field user
Auth_PGpwd_field password
AuthType Basic
AuthName My Secrets
require valid-user
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre><p>Now, create a database named &ldquo;www&rdquo; with a table
&ldquo;apache_user&rdquo; that contains the fields user and password. I
suggest you do not create the table under the web server account
for security reasons. If you create the table under another account
and grant access with the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
grant select on apache_user to apache;
</pre>


then the server can't be used to insert new users or to delete the
whole table. To populate the table, you can use the Perl script
pg95passwd.pl, which ships with mod_auth_pg95. It also encrypts the
passwords for you.
</p><p>The second Apache module I want to introduce is PHP/FI. It is
also available as a stand-alone CGI-Script, but it is more secure
to compile it as a module. PHP/FI allows you to embed scripts in
your web pages in a similar way to Microsoft's Active Server Pages.
It can be configured to allow script access to PostgreSQL. PHP/FI
uses its own script language which is easy to learn. The PostgreSQL
part is based on libpq. If you know libpq, you should have no
problems using PHP/FI for PostgreSQL access. I can't present all
the features of PHP/FI, but I will provide an example script in
<a href="2245l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>, which reads the
contents of the cities table and puts it into an HTML table
environment.</p><p>PHP/FI provides automatic conversion for some data types.
Unlike the C interface, table values are returned in their proper
format for the types integer, boolean, oid, float and real. Arrays
are always returned as strings.</p><p>When you compile PHP/FI for use with PostgreSQL, defining the
compiler switch MAGIC_QUOTES in php.h makes life easier. This
option causes all single and double quote characters in GET and
POST data from HTML forms to be automatically escaped.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x268c580.0x2b7fa88"></a>The Further Development of PostgreSQL</h2></div></div><p>PostgreSQL is now developed by a couple of volunteers, who
coordinate their efforts via the Internet. A mailing list is used
for discussion of implementation details. At the FTP site
(ftp://ftp.postgresql.org/), a <span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span>
archive file with the latest sources is provided every night. The
programmers use the FreeBSD utility
<span   class="bold"><b>sup</b></span> to synchronize their source
trees. There is also a documentation project where the man pages
and the user guide are</p><p>It is planned to achieve full SQL92 compliance in the future
and to constantly speed up the database operation. Version 6.2.1,
which was released in October 1997 brings PostgreSQL a big step
nearer to this goal. Now default values and constraints can be
specified at table creation, to check newly inserted data for
specific conditions. It is also possible to write trigger
functions, that are executed whenever a row of table data is
selected, inserted or updated. There are also new string functions
like trim() substring() and position() which makes manipulating of
strings very convenient. A new Server Programming Interface gives
the users the aility to write server stored procedures and to
implement integrity checks with triggers.</p><p>Compared to the widely used mSQL, PostgreSQL is much slower
as long as only simple queries are involved. But for queries that
include complex joins of multiple tables, PostgreSQL should be
faster. mSQL is written as a program that gives programmers or
webmasters a small and fast tool for simple database operations. In
contrast to this, PostgreSQL is a full featured database system. It
provides more data types, better extensibility and, with the two
available query tools psql and mpsql, more user
friendliness.</p><p>There are commercial database systems which are available for
free as personal versions, e.g., Solid and Yard-SQL. These systems
are fully SQL92 compliant and, in comparison to them, PostgreSQL's
functionality is limited. The features that make PostgreSQL stand
out among these competitors are that it is freely availabe and
anyone who is interested can participate in its further
development.</p><p><a href="2245s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
