    Mr. Klein introduces us to a database called Beagle SQL that
    he developed as a learning experience.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b66580.0x1c5e450"></a></h2></div></div><p>I'd like to introduce you to a
client-server database package that I've been developing on Linux
since May 1996. I picked Linux because it is one of the most robust
development environments available for the development of advanced
client-server applications. Beagle SQL began life as a learning
project. I've always had a fascination with figuring out how things
work under the hood. After years of working with many major (and
minor) database packages, I decided to build my own. Since then
I've received a lot of comments from people who are looking for
more choices in database packages, particularly ones that support
Linux. I have benefited greatly from the hard work so many people
have contributed to the development of Linux and other freely
available tools. Beagle SQL (BSQL) is my way of giving something
back.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b66580.0x1c5e558"></a>Basic Architecture</h2></div></div><p>Database management systems come in many different forms.
Here I'll discuss the client/server architecture of BSQL. The three
base components of this architecture are the client process, the
Connection Manager and the Database Manager.</p><p>The client process is the user application that sends
requests to the Database Manager. The client is simply a program
written using the available API (Application Programming Interface)
provided by the DBMS to access the data in the database. BSQL comes
with both C and Perl APIs.</p><p>The Connection Manager handles all incoming connections to
the Database Manager. When the client program issues a connect
request, the Connection Manager spawns a copy of the Database
Manager to handle all subsequent requests from the client. Once the
client and the Database Manager are talking, the Connection Manager
is free to handle connection requests from other clients.</p><p>In this scenario, each client process is serviced by its own
server process on the remote machine. One advantage of this type of
architecture is that the server process only needs to worry about
its own client, making the communication between the client and
server processes easy to handle. Unfortunately, this architecture
is memory-intensive as a server process is spawned for each
client.</p><p>Another disadvantage is that the locking algorithms become
more complicated as each server process needs to be aware of the
other server processes updating the database. Database management
systems typically incorporate one of two locking methods, coarse
locking and fine locking.</p><p>Coarse locking, also known as table-level locking, is the
easiest of the two to implement. It requires that each client
process writing to a table requests a lock be placed on the entire
table and its associated indices. Once the database manager grants
this lock, the client process has permission to write to the table.
Any other clients needing to write to the same table must wait
until the first client is done. Typically, the duration of the lock
is handled using a transaction. In its simplest form, a transaction
would be a single UPDATE or DELETE statement. Some database
managers give the client the ability to expand the size of a
transaction using a keyword to block several statements together.
This can be very critical in systems where data is replicated
throughout several tables in a database. The main problem with this
type of locking is the bottleneck that can be created when several
clients are trying to update the same table at the same
time.</p><p>Fine locking, also known as row-level locking, is much more
complicated to implement. When a client writes to a table, it
requests a lock only for the row in the table it is currently
updating. This allows several clients to update the same table at
the same time as long as they are not trying to lock the same row.
The complexity comes in when a client is trying to update a table
that has indices associated with it. BSQL uses an indexing method
known as B-trees. Whenever a client updates, deletes or inserts
rows into a table, the B-tree indices for the table may need to be
re-balanced. Concurrent balancing of B-trees is way beyond the
scope of this article, but there have been many books and papers
dedicated to the topic.</p><p>Currently, BSQL uses the
client<b  >-&gt;</b>connection<b  >-&gt;</b>database
architecture without locking. I plan to implement coarse locking
first, eventually evolving into fine locking as time allows.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b66580.0x1c5e978"></a>Client Process</h2></div></div><p>The client process is usually a user-written program that
accesses the database using the provided API, in this case, BSQL's
C API. For those who prefer Perl, a demo client with full Perl
source is provided with the BSQL distribution downloadable from
http://www.beaglesql.org/. The first thing the client program needs
to do is request a connection to the server process using the API
function BSQLConnect(). The connect function returns the file
handle needed by all subsequent communications with the server.
Next, the database you want to manipulate is set using the
BSQLSetCurrentDB() function call, passing the file handle returned
by BSQLConnect() and the name of the database to which you wish to
connect. The following code example illustrates how a client
process connects to a server process running on the same
machine:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
s = BSQLConnect (host);
if (!BSQLSetCurrentDB (s, "test")) {
   fprintf (stdout,
      "\nCan't send current database");
   exit (s);
}
</pre><p>Once you are connected to the database, you can begin sending
SQL queries using the BSQLQueryDB() function, passing the file
handle assigned to the connection and a string containing your SQL
query. A pointer to a result structure is returned that contains
the status of your request. Status information includes whether or
not the query succeeded and, in the case of an SQL SELECT, how many
records or tuples returned to the client process. The code fragment
in <a href="2443l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> shows the results of
a SELECT statement sent to the Database Manager.</p><p>In the above example, the BSQLnfields() function returns the
number of fields per record returned by the SELECT statement. The
BSQLFieldName() function returns a string containing the field name
of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>th field returned. The function
BSQLntuples() returns the number of records that match the SELECT's
WHERE clause. The omission of the WHERE clause in the above example
tells the server process to return all records from the table phone
book. The call to the BSQLFieldValue() function returns a string
containing the data from the <span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>th field of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span>th record. Because the result structure
returned by the BSQLQueryDB() function is dynamically allocated, it
must be freed after you are finished with it. The BSQLFreeResult()
function does just that. The last BSQL API function called in any
client program should be the BSQLDisconnect() function. When
called, it passes an exit message to the server process so it can
terminate the connection and exit cleanly. Without it, you will
litter your system with stray server processes that eat up system
resources.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b66580.0x1c5ece8"></a>Connection Manager</h2></div></div><p>This is probably the most straightforward piece of the
client-server puzzle. The Connection Manager is simply a loop
waiting for incoming messages from client processes. First a socket
is opened for the &ldquo;beagled&rdquo; service (defined in your
/etc/services file), so that the Connection Manager can listen for
incoming connections. Then an endless loop is entered. Once the
Connection Manager receives a signal from a client processes, a
call to accept() returns the socket number that the client and
server processes will communicate through. At this point, the
Connection Manager fork()s the Database Manager, passing the socket
number returned by accept(). After the Database Manager is
successfully started, the Connection Manager starts listening for
the next incoming connection.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b66580.0x1c5edf0"></a>Database Manager</h2></div></div><p>The Database Manager does all the work. The basic components
of the Database Manager are the expression parser, the query
optimizer (currently, no query optimization is done in BSQL), the
index manager, the locking manager and the low-level I/O manager.
The SELECT statement is the most complex operation performed by the
Database Manager. As BSQL supports explicit joins, a single SELECT
statement can search through several tables to return the requested
information. The expression parser must be intelligent enough to
tell which fields in the SELECT list belong to which tables. If you
are joining two tables with duplicate field names, the SELECT
statement must explicitly state which field belongs to which
tables. Wild cards are allowed. When the expression parser sees
wild cards in the field list, it inserts the appropriate field
names into the list.</p><p>There are three examples in the sidebar to give you an idea
of how the expression parser does its work. The statement in
Example 3 fails because <b  >field1</b> is ambiguous. The
expression parser can't tell if it belongs to table A or table B as
both have a field called <b  >field1</b>.</p><p><a href="2443s1.html" target="_self">Examples</a></p><p>When joining tables, the SELECT statement's WHERE clause can
contain several different parts that need to be treated separately.
When joining two tables these parts can include the conditionals
for the first table, the conditionals for the second table and the
join condition. The Database Manager searches each of the two
tables using the appropriate conditionals from the WHERE clause.
Next, it joins the two tables into a temporary table using the
fields in the SELECT field list as well as the fields used in the
join condition. Last, the records in the temporary table are
matched with the join condition and the appropriate records are
made available for retrieval by the client process.</p><p>This operation can get quite complicated and time consuming
when dealing with large and multiple tables. This is where the
query optimizer comes in. Its purpose is to determine the most
efficient order to search and join the tables. BSQL currently
doesn't do query optimization and joins the tables from left to
right as they appear in the SELECT statement. This leaves it up to
the person writing the SQL statement to put some thought into the
order the tables appear in the join.</p><p>When performing searches, the Database Manager uses a set of
low-level I/O routines to retrieve records from the database. Most
commercial database vendors use proprietary file systems to house
their databases. In the case of BSQL, the Linux file system
sufficed. A future enhancement will be a flexible file format that
can allow for such things as BLOBs, images, text documents and
anything else. (A BLOB is a large binary datatype used to store
images, sound bites, programs, etc. in a database table.)</p><p>The method used to store these variable-length records will
significantly impact the performance of the Database Manager. When
a record is written to the database, it is broken down into
fixed-size segments. The database administrator can set the size of
these segments for each database. If a record containing 850 bytes
is written to a table that uses 256 byte segments, it is broken
down into four segments that are chained together. If at a later
time the record size is changed to 1200 bytes, an additional
segment is added to the chain. If the record is reduced to 700
bytes, the unneeded segments are marked for reuse. One drawback
here is that over time the database can become fragmented. Routine
maintenance using a de-fragmenting utility should be performed on
databases that see a lot of UPDATEs and DELETEs. This utility will
be provided with the first official release of BSQL v1.0.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b66580.0x1c5f210"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Hopefully, I've given you some insight into how client server
