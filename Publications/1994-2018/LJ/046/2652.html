</p><p>Las Vegas, Nevada is host each year to one of the largest
technology trade shows in the U.S.  &mdash;COMDEX/Fall. This year nearly
220,000 industry professionals lined up to find, test and research
the latest technologies from the leading industry vendors.</p><p>Earlier in the year the staff of <i  >Linux Journal</i> volunteered to coordinate the COMDEX/Fall Linux
Pavilion. Coordinating the event turned out to mean hours of
preparation, and, luckily, vendors were quick to lend a hand. Kit
Cosper of Linux Hardware Solutions managed to talk the spirit of
Linux into Softbank, the sponsor of the COMDEX show. As a result,
COMDEX personnel were very cooperative and worked with us to ensure
that the floor space for the pavilion was in the best possible
site; that is, we weren't hidden away in a back corner.</p><p>Attendees seemed pleased to find many of their favorite Linux
vendors in one convenient and easy-to-find area. Vendors present
included Caldera, Linux Hardware Solutions, Enhanced Software
Technologies, S.u.S.E., Red Hat Software, Hard Data, Quant-X,
InfoMagic, LinuxMall, Linux International and, of course,
<i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall barely held his own against the hordes of
Linux enthusiasts visiting the Linux International booth. Several
members of the Linux community kindly volunteered their time to
staff the Linux International booth, answering questions and
spreading the word about Linux. Volunteers included Marc Merlin,
Ira Abramov, Dan Peri and Richard Demanowski.</p><p>Red Hat Software announced the December 1 release of Red Hat
Linux 5.0. To mark the event, Red Hat balloons filled the Linux
Pavilion area of the convention center. The Linux mascot, Tux the
penguin, was carried away in all of the excitement (see
photo).</p><p>S.u.S.E., a popular European Linux vendor, also announced the
latest release of their Linux distribution, S.u.S.E. 5.1. This was
S.u.S.E.'s first appearance at COMDEX, and considering their rapid
growth in the U.S. market, it will most likely not be their last.
Their distribution demonstrations proved to be great crowd
pleasers, compliments of Bodo, Rolf, Michael and James Gray, the
President of S.u.S.E. U.S. (See review of S.u.S.E. in this
issue.)</p><p>Clarica Grove, Britta Kuybus and I staffed the
<i  >Linux Journal</i> booth. We were quite pleased
with the turnout of this year's show. During last year's COMDEX, we
were kept busy explaining what Linux is to all comers. We were
pleased to find that this year's COMDEX attendees had remembered
and done their homework from last year. Not only did most people we
spoke with know about Linux, but many of them are using it and very
excited with their results. It goes to show that the popularity of
Linux is indeed growing. Linux is being looked at more than ever as
a cost-effective, viable operating system. Thanks to years of
dedicated work by all of the Linux vendors, Linux International and
the Linux community, we are now able to begin enjoying the success
of Linux. This year's COMDEX Linux Pavilion was a showcase of this
success.</p><p><i  >Linux Journal</i> would like to thank everyone involved with this
year's show&mdash;we look forward to seeing you there next year.</p></div></div>
