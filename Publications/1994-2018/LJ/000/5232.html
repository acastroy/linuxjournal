    Transmeta delivers ingenious solutions for portable computers, using software to take the place of transistors and to regulate power consumption based on the demands of the application.

and mobile systems, and many of us predicted more success for Linux
in embedded systems than on the desktop. Many of us also suspected
(since Linus's remark about a chip with software, and after looking
at Transmeta's patent filings) that we'd soon have a chip that
translated instructions on the fly into the native language of the
chip. Today, Transmeta confirmed suspicions and delivered more than
most of us had expected.</p><p>At 9 a.m. today, Transmeta finally presented its new Crusoe
family of processors, ending months of speculation about what
exactly Transmeta (that company that hired Linus) has been doing.
Two chips are currently known to exist. Information about the chips
has been scarce, which is ironic during the information age. Here's
a quick run-down of the new Crusoe processor.</p><p>Transmeta currently has two chips, the TM3120 and the TM5400.
Both chips are being produced by IBM, and many have already been
shipped to notebook manufacturers throughout the world.</p><p>The TM3120 model is targeted at mobile Internet devices such
as web-pads and PDAs and, hopefully, cell phones. It runs from
333-400MHz, has 96KB of L1 cache and no L2 cache. It supports SDRAM
memory of 66 to 133MHz. It consumes 1 Watt of power, scaling down
to 20 milliwatts during sleep-mode. It is produced with the .22
micron process. It is targeted at mobile Internet devices. It will
run x86 software and features the new Mobile Linux, developed by
Torvalds (and soon to be released to the community), which is a
version of Linux totally contained in ROM. It apparently has its
own IDE and GUI (this is <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> verified), and is
used for machines without hard-drives. It uses very little memory
and requires little power. Hence it is ideal for mobile
computing.</p><p>The TM5400 model is targeted at ultra-light mobile PCs. It
runs from 500-700MHz, has 128KB of L1 cache and 256K of L2 cache.
It supports DDR-SDRAM of 100 to 166MHz, and memory upgrades of
SDRAM in the 66 to 133MHz range. This chip consumes typically less
than 1 watt of power, with as little as 8 milliwatts when idle (not
asleep, just idle). This chip features LongRun technology, whereby
the chip's software adjusts its clock frequency
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> voltage to correspond exactly to the
demands of the application. The TM5400 supports x86 software, which
means that all versions of Linux and the Windows line will work,
and I would expect this also includes BeOS (what
<span   class="emphasis"><em>did</em></span> this have to do with Be's decision to move
into Internet appliances?) and the free Unices. Transmeta claims
the new chip can play DVD movies with less than 2 watts of
power.</p><p>The fundamental idea behind the Crusoe family of processors
is software. Crusoe is, to my knowledge, the only processor with
its own special software (please contact me if you know of
another). The Crusoe processors have a native language, which is a
128-bit VLIW (very large instruction word) instruction set. This
methodology is a bit like RISC times 4; that is, you construct an
instruction molecule out of atoms, and each atom would be roughly
equivalent to a RISC instruction. The chip then uses no speculative
execution, branch prediction, or data flow analysis techniques
(which severely waste energy and can create pipeline stalls), but
instead carries all information about the instructions and
scheduling with the molecule that goes to the processor. VLIW is a
neat idea, but it's not the truly exciting thing about
Crusoe.</p><p>Crusoe chip software employs Code Morphing. This is what we
expected since last summer, but it's true and it's really here.
Crusoe software morphs x86 code into its own native language on the
fly. Not only that, but it caches the translated instructions (no
need to translate data for a data cache), so that it hasn't got to
retranslate them. What is the advantage of this? Not only can you
write software that would enable a chip to be effectively
<span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> chip, but also there's one monstrous
advantage for portable computing: the reduction of
transistors.</p><p>The popularity of RISC chips in embedded systems is due
largely to the fact that RISC severely economizes on transistors.
This means very low power consumption and very low heat. RISC
eliminates transistors by eliminating tons of useless instruction
present in CISC chips (this is an oversimplification).</p><p>Crusoe replaces transistors with &ldquo;software&rdquo;. There's no
reason to have millions of transistors draining energy if you can
replace these transistors with software. Crusoe replaces hardware
with software at a level that hasn't been utilized before. Crusoe's
software also (as already mentioned) manages the caching of
instructions, so typical power-consuming microarchitecture
techniques that accelerated chips of old have also been replaced by
software!</p><p>Software also replaces the stupid BIOS power-on power-off
cycles that typical laptops use to conserve power. The arbitrary
power-flickers, while they conserve energy, have given headaches to
laptop users, cutting off system resources in the middle of
critical tasks. In addition, the old technique never really
conserved power very effectively. It's a lot like running a car
engine either completely at full power, or off. Why not just run
your engine to get you the speed you need, and not waste
resources?</p><p>Crusoe's software knows &ldquo;exactly&rdquo; how much energy an
application needs, and not only alters the clock frequency of the
chip to correspond, but also alters the voltage requirements to
correspond. It does this in a way that consistently maximizes
performance for an application without wasting any energy (clock
frequency has a linear effect and voltage has a squared effect on
power consumption). For example, do you remember when PCs had a
&ldquo;turbo&rdquo; button? That button regulated voltage to the chip to slow
it down so that older programs such as games would run at a usable
speed. Crusoe's software is like a dial that goes up and down
automatically for optimal voltage... and it changes the chip's
clock frequency, like unplugging your Athlon and inserting a P75 to
save energy, then boosting back up, only again it is a dial. Can
you imagine having two dials to regulate clock frequency and
voltage? Fortunately, Crusoe chips do this for you so you don't
have to. Remember, when you're dealing with clock speeds
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> voltage, you've got two dials, so your
power savings will be multiplied. A mere 10 percent reduction to
power actually becomes a 27% reduction. Probably you get the
picture by now of how this works.</p><p>Here is a summary for those who skipped the preceding
paragraphs:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Transmeta has developed a new family of processors

'microarchitecture' techniques which are included with the

require a fan.</p></li><li><p>Crusoe software supports Northbridge integrated
support circuitry without an additional chip or extra power
consumption.</p></li><li><p>Crusoe consumes 1 to 2 watts under heavy loads, and
often subsists on 8 to 20 milliwatts when idle, altering power
consumption on the fly.</p></li><li><p>Transmeta (Linus Torvalds) has developed a
small-footprint, low power-consumption version of Linux known as
Mobile Linux, available as a ROM chip, and supposedly to be
released to the community soon.</p></li></ul></div><p>I sincerely hope that this brief preliminary information is
of some help in satisfying your curiosity. I had hoped to find
technical information on exactly what Crusoe's VLIW instruction set
looks like, what the typical syntax would be, in order to
appreciate the chips on a more than superficial level. I also have
no information on the exact number of transistors, though because
of the low power consumption we would have to estimate that it is
very small.</p><p>Transmeta's website is a good source of information, and is
not very technical. I recommend it for a clear, English-language
explanation of the chips.
<a href="http://www.transmeta.com" target="_self">www.transmeta.com</a>.</p><p>As the information was recently released, it is possible that
some statements are inaccurate, as we do not exactly have a copy of
the chip to verify everything. I have made a sincere effort to
verify as much as possible, but the possibility exists that
something could be wrong. This is not an excuse or a disclaimer,
just friendly advice to verify details with Transmeta before
embarking on any major business plans.</p><p><i  >Linux Journal</i> Senior Editor Doc Searls
is interviewing Linus and we will have that interview, as well as
Doc's account of the proceedings (which I imagine will emphasize
market and Internet elements of the Crusoe chip and Linus's
involvement), available soon.</p><p>Best wishes for fun with this new technology!</p></div></div>
