    If you need to create dynamic web sites and don't want to learn
    the syntax and arbitrary limitations of yet another templating language,
    you should give Quixote a serious look.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a71580.0x2b69240"></a></h2></div></div><p>Quixote is a web application framework
for Python programmers. It was primarily developed by Andrew
Kuchling, Neil Schemenauer and myself (Greg Ward) at the MEMS
Exchange, in order to make our real job&mdash;the creation of a
web-driven network of semiconductor fabrication sites&mdash;easier. For
the development of our main web site
(<a href="http://www.mems-exchange.org" target="_self">www.mems-exchange.org</a>),
we needed to concentrate on the complex business logic needed for
such a network and draw a clear line between the backend and the
user interface. We also wanted to use Python as much as possible,
because in our opinion it is the most appropriate language for such
a complex and rapidly changing application domain.</p><p>Quixote requires Python 2.0 or greater, a good understanding
of Python and a web server that implements the CGI protocol.
(Although your applications will be much happier using a mechanism,
such as FastCGI or SCGI, that allows long-running web
processes.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a71580.0x2b693f8"></a>Intended Audience</h2></div></div><p>Quixote was written by and for Python programmers who need to
develop dynamic web sites while using as much of their existing
Python knowledge as possible. In particular, Quixote is not very
accommodating of the commonly made distinction between &ldquo;web
designers&rdquo; and &ldquo;web developers&rdquo;. If the web designers at your
organization are keen to try out a real programming language, then
Quixote might provide them with a good introduction to Python; but
anyone who doesn't understand what &ldquo;import a module&rdquo; or &ldquo;call a
function&rdquo; means isn't going to get very far with Quixote.
Similarly, anyone who expects to use a dedicated, WYSIWYG HTML
editor for creating web pages will be left out.</p><p>This, incidentally, is completely opposite to the stance
taken by most other web application frameworks, which is precisely
why we don't like most other web application frameworks. In our
limited experience, they all invent an HTML templating language
that embeds some sort of programming language in HTML, often with
deliberate limitations to prevent naive users from shooting
themselves in the feet. This usually ends up being painful and
frustrating for programmers who want power and flexibility and are
perfectly capable of aiming the gun away from their own
feet.</p><p>Specifically, Quixote's templating language, PTL (Python
Template Language), inverts the usual model by making it easier for
Python code to generate long text strings such as HTML documents,
rather than by embedding Python code in an HTML-like template
language. We'll cover PTL in more detail later.</p><p>Quixote might be the tool for you if:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>you need to develop dynamic web sites with complex
programming needs, either in the backend or for presentation/user
interfaces;</p></li><li><p>you're more concerned with providing good content
and getting the logic behind the site right than you are with fancy
design tricks;</p></li><li><p>you don't want to learn (and fight with) yet
another HTML-templating language; and/or</p></li><li><p>you want to use everything you already know about
Python (modules, packages, functions, classes and so forth) to
develop web sites</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a71580.0x2b69920"></a>Using Quixote</h2></div></div><p>Quixote is built on four core principles:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Publishing function results: Quixote's main job is
using a URL to look up a Python callable (e.g., a function or
method) and put its results on the web.</p></li><li><p>The URL is part of the user interface, and the
organization of source code and URL-space should roughly
correspond.</p></li><li><p>Embedding HTML in Python is cleaner and easier than
embedding Python in HTML.</p></li><li><p>No magic: when Quixote can't figure out what to do,
it refuses to guess the programmer's intent, preferring to raise an
exception instead.</p></li></ul></div><p>The usual way to develop a Quixote application is to write a
set of classes that implement the fundamental logic of your
system&mdash;variously referred to as domain classes, domain objects,
business logic and so forth. Your domain classes ideally should
have nothing to do with the type of user interface you're going to
implement. Then you implement the web interface as a separate set
of PTL modules. The relationship between these two bodies of code
should be entirely one-way: the web interface will import and rely
heavily on the domain classes, but the domain classes will be
completely ignorant of the web interface.</p><p>As a real-world example, consider SPLAT!, a simple
bug-tracking tool I wrote as a sample Quixote application (and also
because we needed a simple bug tracker). SPLAT! (named for the
sound of a bug being squashed) consists of a Python package, splat,
with a sub-package called splat.web. The domain classes, SPLAT!'s
idea of what a bug is, what a user is, how its bugs are stored, are
in modules named things like splat.bug, splat.user, splat.database
and so on.</p><p>The web interface to SPLAT! is implemented in the splat.web
package, with the following modules:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
splat.web.util      (splat/web/util.ptl)
splat.web.index     (splat/web/index.ptl)
splat.web.bug_ui    (splat/web/bug_ui.ptl)
splat.web.prefs     (splat/web/prefs.ptl)
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a71580.0x2b69ea0"></a>From Python to PTL</h2></div></div><p>Let's take a look at the code in the splat.web package. Every
namespace (package or module) that Quixote uses must supply two
special identifiers: _q_index() and _q_exports. We'll get to
_q_exports momentarily. For now, let's concentrate on _q_index();
for the splat.web package, it is supplied through an import in
splat/web/__init__.py:</p><p><b  >from splat.web.index import
_q_index</b></p><p>This fits with the recommended practice of putting as little
code as possible in __init__.py files. Any functions or classes
that need to be supplied by a package itself, as opposed to a
module in that package, should simply be imported in the package's
__init__.py.</p><p>Quixote' _q_index() is equivalent to index.html, but instead
of a file containing the default web page for a directory,
_q_index() is a Python callable (e.g., a function, a method or a
PTL template) that returns the default web page for a namespace. In
fact, there are many useful analogies between a traditional
filesystem-based web server (such as Apache) and Quixote's
Python-centric way of building a web site.:</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x2a71580.0x2b6a108"></a><p class="title"><b></b></p><table     summary="" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th><p>Filesystem (e.g. Apache)</p></th><th><p>Quixote</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>directory</p></td><td><p>Python namespace (module, package, ...)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>file</p></td><td><p>Python callable object (function, method, ...)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>index.html</p></td><td><p>_q_index()</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>file exists, is readable</p></td><td><p>callable object exists, is in _q_exports</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Let's consider a simple _q_index() for SPLAT!, written as a
Python function:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
from quixote.html import html_quote
from splat.web.util import get_bug_database
def _q_index (request):
    result = ["""\
        &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;SPLAT! Bug Index&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;table&gt;
          &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;bug id&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;description&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;/tr&gt;
        """]
    bug_db = get_bug_database()
    for bug in bug_db.get_all_bugs():
        if bug.status != bug.ST_RESOLVED:
            result.append("""\
                &lt;tr&gt;
                  &lt;td&gt;%s&lt;/td&gt;
                  &lt;td&gt;%s&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;/tr&gt;
                """ % (bug, html_quote(bug.description))
    result.append("""\
        &lt;/table&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;
        """)
    return "".join(result)
</pre><p>We build up the web page as a list of strings, which are
concatenated at the end. (This is much more efficient that repeated
string concatenation border. In fact, a loop of <b  >result +=
...</b> probably qualifies as an antipattern in Python
because of its quadratic running time.)</p><p>For this simple example, writing _q_index() as a Python
function isn't too inconvenient, but there is a better way: PTL.
PTL is simply Python with a different way of specifying function
return values. In fact, the above function is quite easy to rewrite
as a PTL template:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
template _q_index (request):
    """\
    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;SPLAT! Bug Index&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;bug id&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;description&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
    """
    bug_db = get_bug_database()
    for bug in bug_db.get_all_bugs():
        if bug.status != bug.ST_RESOLVED:
            """\
              &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;%s&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;%s&lt;/td&gt;
              &lt;/tr&gt;
            """ % (bug, html_quote(bug.description))
    """\
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
    """
</pre><p>At this stage, the differences are unremarkable: instead of
explicitly accumulating and returning the HTML document, the PTL
version does so implicitly. PTL works by accumulating the result of
every statement that runs in a template; each non-None result is
stored in an instance of TemplateIO (a class provided by Quixote).
When the template returns, it actually returns str() of the
TemplateIO object. This converts all of the accumulated statement
results to strings (again, with str()) and returns the
concatenation of those strings.</p><p>PTL starts to get fun when you realize that you can refactor
PTL templates just like you can Python functions. For example, we
might break up our _q_index() template as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
template header (title):
    """\
    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;SPLAT! - %s&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    """ % html_quote(title)
template footer ():
    """\
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
    """
template bug_row (bug):
    """\
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;%s&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;%s&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
    """ % (bug, html_quote(bug.description)
template _q_index (request, bug):
    header("Bug Index")
    """\
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;bug id&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;description&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
    """
    bug_db = get_bug_database()
    for bug in bug_db.get_all_bugs():
        if bug.status != bug.ST_RESOLVED:
            bug_row(bug)
    "&lt;/table&gt;\"
    footer()
</pre><p>Now we have reusable header() and footer() templates, and we
have simplified the main loop of _q_index(). Any programmer
recognizes the value of procedural abstraction; most web-templating
languages, unfortunately, do not.</p><p>Writing a _q_index() function for our root namespace means
Quixote can generate a response when a user requests the base URL
corresponding to this application. For example, you might set
things up so that /bugs/ is the base URL for SPLAT! at your site,
i.e., /bugs/ corresponds to the splat.web package. When your server
receives a request for /bugs/, then Quixote will call
splat.web._q_index()--which, thanks to that import in
splat/web/__init__.py, is really splat.web.index._q_index()--and
return the resulting HTML page. But, as long as you can implement
something in Python (or PTL), you can use Quixote to associate it
with a URL and put it on the web.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a71580.0x2b617b0"></a>Beyond _q_index()</h2></div></div><p>As the table above implies, Quixote can publish the results
of any Python function or PTL template, as long as you list them in
_q_exports. For instance, I might want to borrow a convention from
GUI programming and add an &ldquo;About&rdquo; page to SPLAT!. The obvious
place to put this in URL-space is /bugs/about, so I need to add a
callable object about() to the splat.web package. One way to do
this (although not necessarily a recommended practice) is to define
a Python function in splat/web/__init__.py:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
import splat  # for __version__
from splat.web.util import header, footer
[...]
def about (request):
    text = '''\
        &lt;p&gt;This bug database is brought to you by:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="+3"&gt;SPLAT! %s&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For more information, please visit the
        &lt;a href="http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/splat/"&gt;
        SPLAT! web page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        ''' % splat.__version__
    return header("About") + text + footer()
</pre><p>This demonstrates how cleanly Python and PTL code mesh. I can
import the header() and footer() templates shown above (which
incidentally, actually live in splat.web.util) and call them just
like a Python function.</p><p>The about() function doesn't actually work yet, though. It
would be dangerous for Quixote to trust that any random Python
function that happens to be named by a URL should be published on
the Web. Thus, you must explicitly declare that about() is meant to
be exported to the world by listing it in the _q_exports list for
this namespace, which also lives in splat/web/__init__.py:</p><p><b  >_q_exports = ['about']</b></p><p>You get pretty far with Quixote just writing Python functions
and PTL templates, and having Quixote publish their results via the
Web. However, making the URL part of the user interface means that
the obvious way for SPLAT! to publish individual bugs is via URLs
like /bugs/0001, /bugs/0134, etc. Quixote has a nice hook that lets
you handle arbitrary URLs like this.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a71580.0x2b61ac8"></a>Object Publishing with _q_getname()</h2></div></div><p>Object publishing is just a fancy term (shamelessly stolen
from Zope) to mean that you can use Quixote to wrap a web interface
around arbitrary objects. As always with Quixote, the trick is to
map a URL onto Python code. But now, instead of providing a Python
function that is named to match a URL component, you provide a
Python function, _q_getname(), that Quixote uses as a fallback. For
example, if Quixote is processing a request for the URL /bugs/0124,
it's not going to find a function called 0124 in the splat.web
package. Before giving up and raising an exception (which turns
into an HTTP 404 error), Quixote looks for a function _q_getname()
in that package. If it finds one, Quixote calls your _q_getname(),
passing it the string &ldquo;0124&rdquo;--the URL component currently being
examined.</p><p>Don't think of _q_getname() as being like _q_index() or
about(). Quixote only calls functions like these at the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>end</em></span> of URL traversal: e.g., when processing
the URL /bugs/about, the bugs component corresponds to a Python
namespace, splat.web, so Quixote doesn't have to call anything.
Only when it's looking at the terminal component, about, does it
call a Python function&mdash;the splat.web.about() function defined
above. Likewise, in processing the URL /bugs/, Quixote only calls
_q_index() because the terminal component of the URL (the part
after the last slash) is the empty string.</p><p>However, _q_getname() can be called anywhere along a URL. For
instance, SPLAT! actually implements per-bug URLs as namespaces
(e.g., /bugs/0134/ calls a _q_index() method, /bugs/0134/edit calls
an edit() method, etc.). In this case, the bug ID is not the
terminal component of the URL, but Quixote handles it the same way,
via _q_getname(). For this article, though, the bug ID will be the
terminal URL component, and we're only going to deal with URLs like
/bugs/0134. The easiest way to do this is to write a _q_getname()
function. Again, assume this code lives in splat/web/__init__.py,
which returns the HTML page for the requested bug:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
from quixote.errors import TraversalError
from splat.web.util import get_bug_database
[...]
def _q_getname (request, name):
    try:
        bug_id = int(name)
    except ValueError:
        raise TraversalError("invalid bug ID: %r (not an integer)" % name)
    bug_db = get_bug_database()
    bug = bug_db.get_bug(bug_id)
    if bug is None:
        raise TraversalError("no such bug: %r" % bug_id)
    return header("Bug %s" % bug) + format_bug_page(bug) + footer()
</pre><p>(I'm omitting the implementation of format_bug_page().) Most
of this function is concerned with taking arbitrary user input (in
the form of a URL component) and either fetching a bug object from
the bug database or raising the appropriate exception. (Quixote
exceptions generally correspond to HTTP error codes;
TraversalException becomes a 404 &ldquo;not found&rdquo; error. The only time
applications need to raise TraversalException is inside
_q_getname() functions, because all other URL interpretation is
handled by Quixote internally.)</p><p>Using _q_getname() to publish a namespace for an object
rather than a single page is even more fun, but beyond the scope of
this article. Now that we've got a good feel for programming with
Quixote, let's take a look at the bureaucracy necessary to get from
your web server to Quixote application code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a71580.0x2b61de0"></a>Connecting Your Web Server to Your Quixote
Application</h2></div></div><p>Every Quixote application needs a bit of glue to to connect
the web server to the application; the nature of this glue depends
on the nature of the connection. The simplest way to connect a web
server to a Quixote application is CGI, in which case you need to
supply a CGI driver script for your application. The CGI driver
script for SPLAT! (which, incidentally, also works with FastCGI)
looks something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
1.#!/usr/bin/python
2.
3. from quixote import enable_ptl, Publisher
4. from splat.config import OptionParser, get_config
5.
6. enable_ptl()
7. config = get_config()
8. config.read_file("/www/conf/splat.conf")
9. pub = Publisher("splat.web", config=config)
10. pub.setup_logs()
11. pub.publish_cgi()
</pre><p>The call to enable_ptl() in line 6 installs an import hook
that makes Python's import statement treat PTL modules the same as
Python modules. It only has to be done once in each Python process,
so the driver script is the obvious place to do it.</p><p>Lines 7 and 8 create a standard SPLAT! configuration object
and customize it by reading a local configuration file. (In
reality, it's more complex than this because SPLAT! has several
auxiliary command-line scripts that need to read the same config
file.) Most Quixote applications will want to do something like
this in order to customize Quixote's behaviour. In particular,
Quixote's default settings prefer security and performance over
ease of debugging, so for developing new applications, it's useful
to override them by reading a local config file. The demo provided
with Quixote has a simple example of doing this.</p><p>Line 9 is where we finally establish that the web interface
for SPLAT! is implemented by the splat.web package. Every Quixote
application is centered around an instance of the Publisher class,
which is where all of Quixote's URL interpretation is done. Because
this object needs to know the root namespace of your application,
it is passed to the Publisher constructor as shown.</p><p>Every Quixote application can have up to three log files: the
error log, the debug log and the access log. The names of these log
files are specified via the configuration object passed to
Publisher's constructor (they are a good thing to put in your local
configuration file), but you need to call setup_logs(), as shown in
line 10, to make sure the log files are actually opened and written
to. Every HTTP request processed by Quixote is logged in the access
log; every string written to sys.stdout is written to the debug
log; and every string written to sys.stderr goes to the error log.
This means that instrumenting a Quixote application for debugging
is as simple as adding print statements.</p><p>Finally, in line 11, we pass control over to Quixote. If this
driver script is used as a CGI script, then this whole process will
repeat for every HTTP request; if it is handled as a FastCGI
script, then the process_cgi() method will process requests as long
as the web server keeps the script running.</p><p>At this point, you can install the driver script wherever
your web server is configured to look for CGI scripts, e.g., with
the standard Debian Apache package, you would put it in
/usr/lib/cgi-bin. Now you can access SPLAT! via a URL like
/cgi-bin/splat.cgi/, which will work but is rather ugly and exposes
a lot of implementation details. If you use Apache with the rewrite
engine enabled, it's trivial to add a rule that rewrites /bugs/ to
/cgi-bin/splat.cgi/, so end users never have to see that ugly,
over-informative URL. See doc/web-server.txt in the Quixote source
distribution for more information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a71580.0x2b62150"></a>Availability (and More Sample Code)</h2></div></div><p>Quixote is available from

most of Quixote's important principles along the way.</p><p>You'll also find documentation for some interesting Quixote
features I haven't covered here, notably Quixote's session
management interface and its HTML form/widget library. Session
management lets you maintain server-side information about
individual users of your site via a session cookie, which has all
sorts of useful applications for dynamic web sites. Quixote's
form/widget library makes constructing and processing complex web
forms (still the only portable, reliable way to interact with users
over the web) much easier. Like the rest of Quixote, it wraps an
object-oriented Python interface around a common web programming
task.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a71580.0x2b62410"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Quixote originally was written because we were dissatisfied
with the available options for writing web applications in Python.
The only tool that came close to what we wanted was Zope, which
turned out to be much bigger and more complex than we needed. Zope
has the &ldquo;web designer&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;web developer&rdquo; distinction built in
from the start, and works very hard to make a web site mostly
editable through the web itself. This is an interesting idea, but
it adds tremendous complexity to Zope. As programmers who are quite
happy using text editors and the filesystem, we felt left out in
the cold. Thus, in creating Quixote, we shamelessly stole Zope's
best idea (mapping URLs to Python objects) and geared the whole
thing towards Python programmers. The most obvious example of this
is that where Zope maps URLs to arbitrary objects in an object
database, Quixote maps them to Python packages, modules and
functions&mdash;objects that are easily created and manipulated by
Python programmers using nothing more than a text editor. The
result is a web application framework that makes the creation of
dynamic web pages so easy it almost feels like cheating.</p></div></div>
