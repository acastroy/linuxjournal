    Opening up a world of possibilities for one woman, using OEone
    HomeBase with Linux preinstalled.

gaining in a number of markets, most notably in the server arena.
Recently, the march onto the desktop has begun and the PDA market
has opened up as well. There are also clusters and supercomputers.
However, there is one more market where Linux could make more
inroads: the home user. A few articles are around regarding techies
who have helped their non-techie friends and family members get
running with Linux. But what about the non-techie home user doing
it all by themselves? Could a home user, say a grandmother of
three, use Linux with no help from anyone but the vendor's normal
support system? This is the story of one such grandmother and her
entrance into the wonderful world of Tux.</p><p>First, some background on the grandmother. She is a
64-year-old mother of four, of which I am one, and grandmother of
three. Her previous computer experience consists of being a user as
a secretary and in administration. She's been retired since 1995.
Her current computer needs are quite normal: e-mail, web,
calendar/date book, the occasional need to write a document or two,
a game of solitaire and so on. This is, I feel, an accurate
description of most home users. She had been using a Windows 98
system that my brothers bought for her a while back. A number of
times she had complained the computer was not acting right and
required more effort than it was worth to get anything done.</p><p>Being the good son that I am, I decided that she needed a
change. Earlier in 2002 I had written a mini-review of OEone's
HomeBase Linux for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Weekly News</em></span>. I
thought it would make a perfect system for her. After talking to
the people at OEone, they offered to ship a pre-installed system to
my mother for her to use and allow me to write about her
experience. One reason that I wanted to go with a pre-installed
system is I wanted her to get a computer that was functionally like
the one she was using. She hadn't had to install Windows 98 on the
old box, so why even bother with a Linux install1? A few days after
I spoke with OEone the system arrived. The following is an
interview with her where she tells exactly what it's like to
&ldquo;switch&rdquo; to Linux.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Joe:</b></span> So what was your first
impression of OEone HomeBase?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mom:</b></span> Wow! I just couldn't
get over how easy, quick, simple.... I can't use enough adjectives
to expound on the simplicity of this system. It's great.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>J:</b></span> How much work was done by
a techie in setting up the system?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>M:</b></span> Just setting up the mail
for me. That's about it. [I just configured the IMAP and SMPT
settings - jjk]</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>J:</b></span> What specific things do
you like about HomeBase Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>M:</b></span> I love the page to access
the applications. It's easy to pop right back to it and go from one
application to another. I use this as my main starting page. The
web log-on location bar is in just the right spot&mdash;always
accessible but unobtrusive. I can't wait until I can afford a
printer. I know I will do even more (like write letters to my
sisters and brothers who do not use computers to communicate). They
are quite older than I and still write letters. I prefer e-mail,
but at least a computer generated document is more my style. I hate
to write letters, and I do want to talk to my brothers and sisters
more often than a quick telephone call.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>J:</b></span> What about the main
applications? How did they stack up to what you had previously been
using?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>M:</b></span> If you have used any word
processing system2 before, you can use this one easily as well. If
you have not, the user guide is well written and it should be
simple to follow the directions. The e-mail from document
[capability] is wonderful. It is a really useful feature. My page
is super, too. I like knowing the local weather and what is on my
agenda for the week without having to go to my calendar or to the
weather channel. It's like one stop shopping.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>J:</b></span> Did you know you could do
that in MS Office on the old computer?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>M:</b></span> No, I didn't know that.
Figuring out how to do anything on the old system was very
difficult.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>J:</b></span> Was there anything else
you found different than the old system?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>M:</b></span> Yes. The address book is
really special. I can't wait until I can scan pictures onto my
cards. It's really helpful that the system automatically makes
cards for those to whom you send e-mails. It was quick and simple
to delete those that I did not wish to retain. Oh, I almost forgot
to mention the calendar3. I never really used one before, because I
couldn't figure out how to access it on the old system. Now, with
HomeBase Linux, I don't know how I was able to function without my
calendar. I do volunteer work for the church by driving seniors to
their doctor appointments. If I didn't have this calendar, I don't
think I would be able to keep track of the numerous dates and times
I drive each week. What with my own appointments and the seniors'
appointments, sometimes I have three or four different appointments
per week. My daughter stopped by and saw me putting a new event on
my calendar and was really impressed with it as well.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>J:</b></span> Have you had any need to
do any administration work? Managing the system or adding users,
things like that?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>M:</b></span> Yes, actually. I have
added three users, my grandchildren. It was so simple. The easiest
system I have ever used. And the upgrade feature is wonderful. I
was notified that an upgrade for the system was available. I
clicked the button and <span   class="emphasis"><em>voil&agrave;</em></span>, the
upgrade was quickly completed. I really appreciated the prompt
comments. So polite and seemingly personal. I felt as though they
were written directly to me.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>J:</b></span> Did you ever have need to
contact OEone for support or help?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>M:</b></span> I did. I had gone on a
vacation for two weeks and when I got back the system was dead. I
think one of my sons [It wasn't me - jjk] might have been using it
while I was gone. (Laughs) Anyway, I called the tech support line,
and they talked me through some diagnostic procedures. The people
on the other end of the line were very helpful. The problem turned
out to be a hardware failure so the company sent a completely new
system, already pre-configured with my settings.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>J:</b></span> Was there anything you
didn't like about HomeBase Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>M:</b></span> Nothing major, just some
minor annoyances (and I do mean minor). For the first day I found
it difficult to adjust to not exiting things. But once I got used
to it I loved it. Also, I work a lot in percentages, and I could
not find a percent key on the calculator. Perhaps I just didn't
recognize it. Maybe it's just too sophisticated a calculator for a
non-scientific user. Lastly, I wish I could change the picture on
the back of the deck of cards. See what I mean? All very minor
things.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>J:</b></span> Did all the web sites you
visited look good and work correctly?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>M:</b></span> Yes. There was one time
when it said I needed a plug-in of some kind, but I clicked where
it told me to and things worked after that.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>J:</b></span> Did you exchange
documents with others? Were their any problems doing so?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>M:</b></span> I exchanged some
documents with my son [This time it is me4 - jjk], and it all
seemed to work fine.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>J:</b></span> Is there anything you
miss from your old computer?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>M:</b></span> No, nothing that I can
think of.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>J:</b></span> Do you use the computer
more now?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>M:</b></span> Ever so much more than
before. My family here at the house has commented that I am on this
computer more than they ever noticed before.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>J:</b></span> You have mentioned that
HomeBase Linux is much easier to use. In what way is it
easier?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>M:</b></span> When I think of something
or if I am walking by and something comes to me, I can just plop
right down (or just stand there if it's something short or quick I
want to do) and proceed. No waiting to bring up the program or
remembering to log on or exit.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>J:</b></span> Would you recommend
HomeBase Linux to your friends?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>M:</b></span> Definitely, yes. It's
truly amazing to see what you can really do with a computer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c34580.0x1d2d948"></a>Resource</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://www.oeone.com" target="_self">OEone</a></p><p><a href="http://old.lwn.net/daily/OEone1.0_part2.php3" target="_self"><span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
