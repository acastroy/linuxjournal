    If you're in the market for a new laptop, here's some advice to
    consider before you spend the money.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f4580.0x1aec240"></a></h2></div></div><p>Buying a fully Linux compliant laptop can
be a truly harrowing experience. Many people have learned to deal
with uncompliant laptops. It's interesting to learn about some of
the things people do to get by with an uncompliant or misconfigured
system. When having audio problems, for instance, some users simply
keep the volume to a minimum. Others, when having problems with X,
get into the habit of restarting X every half hour; in especially
bad cases they even reboot the laptop every half hour. I find these
situations unacceptable. It is one thing if you were given the
laptop at no cost, but it's completely different if you dropped
hundreds of dollars of your own cash to get this kind of system.
These problems all can be avoided if you take the time to educate
yourself about what is available, set realistic goals for what you
want to buy and make certain the machine you want is within your
price range. All this said, setting up a Linux-based laptop
actually can be a satisfying experience.</p><p>As with any other major purchase, when buying a laptop the
first thing you need to do is define your needs. Take everything
into consideration, and start with basic usage items. What size
screen would you like to have? Do you prefer a touchpad or a
trackpoint? Do you have a requirement for battery life? Do you want
to be able to watch DVDs? Do you want to burn CDs? Do you require a
good sound system? Are you planning on connecting to a wireless
network, modem-based ISP or conventional wired LAN; or do you not
require any LAN or internet connection at all? For what purposes
are you primarily going to use the laptop: word processing, gaming,
photo manipulation, SA access terminal, web browsing? All of these
questions and uses should be considered, because the answers can
effect drastically both the cost of the laptop and the time
required to make it ready for use.</p><p>Once your needs are defined, start browsing the major laptop
manufacturers' product lines. From my experience, I strongly
recommend buying laptops from the big names: Toshiba, IBM, HP,
Compaq, Dell and so on. Staying with the major names can guarantee
support in the long run. If you need a battery three years from
now, for example, it will be much easier to acquire one for a
Thinkpad then it would be for an Acme brand no longer in
business.</p><p>The largest advantage of having a popular brand is you can
rely on the Linux community as a whole. The more people who have
your laptop the more FAQs, how-tos and general documentation you
can access. It is comforting to post a laptop-oriented problem on a
public news group and receive replies from a dozen people with the
same exact laptop who experienced the same exact problem.</p><p>So you've found a couple of laptops that you think fit your
needs, but you're not sure how compatible they are with Linux. I
suggest making a checklist of your prospective laptops' major
components. Many times you'll find that a particular manufacturer
doesn't have list the complete specifications on their web site.
There are a few ways to remedy this situation. If the laptop can be
store-bought, go to a walk-in retail outlet and use Windows to get
a gander at what makes it tick. Windows provides a comprehensive
list of all the components it detects. Simply open up the device
manager and make a list of what you find, including what is listed
under the Control Panel, System, Hardware and Device Manager. Take
the list home and start your research.</p><p>A much more convenient way of finding out what things of
interest are inside your prospective laptop is to do a Google
search with the laptop's name and Linux as keywords, for example,
Thinkpad R32 Linux&ldquo;. Chances are you'll find a how-to that someone
has created to instruct others about installing Linux on that
particular machine. Such how-tos can be priceless resources in your
Linux laptop quest; not only do you find a component list, but you
also find out up-front how compatible the machine is.</p><p>In the area of compatibility, I find the biggest stickler to
be the video card. Due to the quick pace with which laptops are
being developed, Linux is struggling to keep most video cards
supported with the most features enabled. It's not uncommon to have
a video card capable of hardware-based 3-D rendering that simply
can't do so under Linux due to driver limitations. This situation
will change over time, of course, but who wants to wait if they
don't have to?</p><p>At present the major manufacturers of video cards for laptops
are ATI and NVIDIA. NVIDIA has a closed-source proprietary driver
that is fully capable of 3-D rendering and offers many 2-D
resolutions, all in full 24-bit color. These capabilities are
impressive, but there's a catch. Due to the driver's closed-source
nature, if a particular line of laptops has a problem with the
driver, getting NVIDIA to address the issue could be difficult and
may not happen at all.</p><p>ATI, however, handles Linux in a way that is friendlier to
the Linux community: ATI's drivers are open source. Although ATI's
support for the Linux platform initially was not up to the
standards of NVIDIA, ATI's current supports is growing fast.
Because the drivers are open-source, many people are working to
provide the community with more than capable drivers that quickly
are rivaling NVIDIA. Will ATI surpass NVIDIA in its support for
Linux? It already may have, but NVIDIA is a major player and could
turn the tables in an instant. Either way, Linux users win.</p><p>Other hardware of concern includes the sound chipset, modem,
networking chipset and wireless devices. Depending on your needs,
you might not require all of these items, but I'll bet the farm
that you are going to need at least a few of them. Sound can be the
most difficult and perhaps least vital thing to get running under
Linux. Fortunately, in most cases on-line documentation can be
found that will assist you in getting the sound to run
properly.</p><p>Modems can be another big stickler for Linux compatibility.
Software-based modems are common amongst laptop manufacturers, so
it's not uncommon to discover that a particular modem does not work
under Linux. If a functional modem is important to you, be sure to
do some modem-specific research prior to that final purchase. In a
pinch you can always use a PC card-based modem.</p><p>Although most integrated networking chipsets are supported by
Linux, you never can tell with the off brands. Your networking
chipset is definitely worth looking into. If I had to pick one
component, LAN connectivity is perhaps the most important. Without
it I would not own a laptop.</p><p>This bring us to my last area of concern, wireless LAN
support. The bleeding edge of wireless networking can offer a
plethora of compatibility obstacles. The 802.11 standard itself is
hardly a standard, what with all of its substandards&mdash;802.11a,
802.11b, 802.11g. Different access points play better with
different client cards. Certain cards are faster, certain ones can
work for a longer range, certain ones work better in &rdquo;noisy&ldquo;
situations and certain ones are more compatible with those of other
speeds. My point is special attention must be paid to wireless if
it's support is vital to you.</p><p>All of the above-mentioned components go to show the overall
quality of the laptop. In my opinion, a 3Com-integrated NIC has a
higher value than does a Realtech. Sure, they'll both work, but in
the long run you want to get the most for your money. The same goes
for all the components of the laptop. An ATI IGP300 with 32MB of
shared memory simply isn't as valuable as an NVIDIA Geforce4 32MB
video card. You'll find many of these quality/price issues apparent
when you start pricing individual laptops. The best method is to
take your time, read as much as you can about each critical
component and make an educated decision.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f4580.0x1aec7c0"></a>To Pay for Windows or Not to Pay for
Windows?</h2></div></div><p>This question is a loaded issue in the portable Linux
community. When you build a standard desktop the issue doesn't
arise. You buy each component independently, so there is no
Microsoft-enslaved reseller watching over you. Due to the general
proprietary nature of laptops, however, in many cases you have no
choice but to deal with a reseller (as most major manufacturers are
resellers) and, in turn, purchase a Microsoft-based OS. Stories are
going around that you can call the laptop manufacturer itself and
specifically request to have them ship you a system free of
Microsoft OSes. In turn, you save the cost of the licensing fee. I
personally have tried this tactic and to no avail; both IBM and
Dell turned down the idea. This may be a major issue for the
die-hard users, but I think most people don't get hung up on the
idea of buying something they are never going to use. Keep in mind
that the resellers are selling Windows at their discounted rate. In
some cases the rate is as cheap as $15. So unless you can't stand
the thought of Redmond getting your undeserved cash, I wouldn't put
much thought into the issue. Yes, it sucks, but unfortunately its a
necessary evil.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f4580.0x1aec8c8"></a>So You Found Your Dream Laptop</h2></div></div><p>You found it, and now you're trying to find it for the best
price. This is the final hurdle to your life in portable-Linux
nirvana. You have four main choices, a walk-in retail store, an
on-line retail store, the laptop manufacturer itself or an auction
site. Browse the auction sites to get a ball-park figure of what
people are willing to spend. If the system you want is going for
over retail cost, you can be sure it is a high quality product and
in demand. In my experience, though, I wouldn't recommend making
that final purchase through an auction site. Not only is your
purchase not warrantied in any way, there is a good chance that you
could be paying too much. For example, I recently purchased a
laptop directly from its manufacturer for $1,500. Later that
evening the same exact laptop was sold on eBay for $2,100. People
often get caught up in the frenzy of bidding and don't take the
time to research where the best buy can be found. If it's
available, I suggest purchasing directly from the manufacturer.
Some manufacturers, such as HP/Compaq, do not sell certain lines of
laptops through their site and refer you to an outside retail
store. The biggest advantage of a walk-in store is the immediate
satisfaction. Or, if you have any initial problems with the laptop,
you can return it without having to worry about RMAs and extra
shipping costs.</p><p>The last major item of concern is one that can be easily
overlooked&mdash;return policies. The return policy is your safety net
to protect you from spending your days with an ugly stepson of a
laptop. Let's say you finally get your laptop in hand and
installed. Then, for some reason beyond your control, you find that
whenever you close the lid X crashes. You've checked the newsgroups
and forums, but no one can help you. This may be a good time to cut
your losses, make the return and go back to the drawing board. Many
manufacturers have 30-day, &rdquo;satisfaction guaranteed", money-back
return policies. It's common place that retail outlets, whether
walk-in or on-line, have 14-day return policies. An eBay purchase,
for the most part, has no warranty. Be sure to take this all into
account when dropping that last coin.</p><p>Remember, as with any purchase, knowledge is your friend. A
hasty purchase could lead you to hours of headaches down the road.
A big issue I had when making my recent laptop purchase was the
overall cost. I went into it wanting to spend $500 and in the end
spent $1,500. I paid for those extra nine yards to be sure that my
purchase was money well spent on a machine that I could rely on for
years to come. I was fortunate enough to have a flexible budget,
but if you're stuck with a certain dollar amount, be sure to do
plenty of research. And don't forget to have fun!</p></div></div>
