    Wouldn't it be great to have a way to isolate variables based on
    how the data is assigned in the first place?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e4580.0x19dc240"></a></h2></div></div><p>A few years ago, my wife and I decided to
go on a skiing trip up north. To reserve skiing equipment, you had
to give 24-hour advance notice using the ski lodge's on-line web
site. The catch was my wife had asked me to make the reservations
23 hours before the deadline.</p><p>So I got to thinking and examined the on-line web site, which
would not let you make any reservations within the 24-hour
timeframe. However, once you selected an appropriate date, I
noticed the URL was:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
https://www.somewhere.com/reservations.php?date=01-23-01
</pre><p>It occurred to me that although they had locked down security
on what dates I could choose from, the final value was placed in a
<span   class="bold"><b>GET</b></span> statement at the end of the
web address. I modified the web address to use &ldquo;date=01-22-01&rdquo; and
indeed, our skies were waiting for us first thing the next morning
(we paid for them, of course).</p><p>This innocent yet practical example is only one of the
dangers we must be aware of when using any programming language
that can be used in ways we did not intend, which leads us to our
discussion of PHP Superglobals.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e4580.0x19dc500"></a>Forms</h2></div></div><p>To understand Superglobals, it is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>critical</em></span> that you understand how data is
passed from one web page to another (e.g., forms). Specifically,
you must be aware of two methods known as GET and POST. You also
should be familiar with the HTML &lt;FORM&gt; statement (a good
reference is
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html" target="_self">www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html</a>).</p><p>You've probably seen something like this before:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;form name="form1" method="post" action="process.php"&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Please enter your name:&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="text" name="yourname" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="button" name="Submit" value="Submit" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre><p>This is standard, nothing-fancy HTML form code that asks for
some information and then submits the data to the file process.php.
The critical bit here is the
<span   class="bold"><b>method</b></span> declaration, which tells
the form <span   class="bold"><b>how</b></span> to submit the data;
for this, we need to digress for a moment or two (hold your
breath):</p><p>For those who recall the early days of HTML, forms were
provided by means of the &lt;ISINDEX&gt; HTML tag. By inserting
this tag into the HEAD of your HTML documents, a text field
appeared where you could supply out input. As the new HTML+
standard evolved, a &lt;FORM&gt; tag was designed and could be used
with a METHOD attribute of GET, POST or PUT.  So, this leaves
us with a few different ways to send our data.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e4580.0x19dc8c8"></a>GET</h2></div></div><p>With GET, variables and their values are sent in the header
of the URL request appended as part of the URL itself.  The
limitation is that web addresses (URLs) are limited to 8,192
characters; if the amount of data is too long, it will be
truncated. Also, even with an SSL connection, the data is not
encrypted because it is part of the web address.</p><p>For example, a web page might have a form statement like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;form name="form1" method="get" action="process.php"&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Please enter your name, e-mail address, and a comment:&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="text" name="yourname" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="text" name="email" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="text" name="comment" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="button" name="Submit" value="Submit" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre><p>When you clicked <span   class="emphasis"><em>Submit</em></span>, your web
browser would take the values you filled out in the form and
redirect you to this web address:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
http://www.fluffygerbil.com/process.php?yourname=fred+smith&amp;email=fred@nowhere.com&amp;comment=I+have+no+comment
</pre><p>Notice how the values of the form are part of the web address
itself? That's the essence of GET.</p><p>For the curious, what is actually sent in the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>raw</em></span> HTTP transmission to accomplish this
transaction is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
GET /process.php?yourname=fred+smith&amp;email=fred@nowhere.com&amp;comment=I+have+no+comment HTTP/1.0
Accept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, */*

</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e4580.0x19dcce8"></a>POST</h2></div></div><p>With POST, the variables and their values are sent in the
body of the URL request, not the header.  The advantages of
this type of data transmission is there is no limit to the size of
the data being sent; it is contained in the body of the HTTP
request, not the header.  Also, if you're using an SSL
connection, the data will be encrypted too&mdash;what a deal.  For
example, consider a web page with a form statement like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;form name="form1" method="post" action="process.php"&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Please enter your name, e-mail address, and a comment:&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="text" name="yourname" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="text" name="email" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="text" name="comment" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="button" name="Submit" value="Submit" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

install PHP 4.2.2 or later, you might happen to notice that when
compiling PHP, it states:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                         *** NOTE ***                               |
|            The default for register_globals is now OFF!            |
|                                                                    |
| If your application relies on register_globals being ON, you       |
| should explicitly set it to on in your php.ini file.               |
| Note that you are strongly encouraged to read                      |
| http://www.php.net/manual/en/security.registerglobals.php          |
| about the implications of having register_globals set to on, and   |
| avoid using it if possible.                                        |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
</pre><p>This means PHP will be ultra-paranoid about the data passed
to it and will require you to state from which
<span   class="emphasis"><em>method</em></span> the data should be coming.  Also,
you should be aware that more ways are available to send data to
your PHP pages than GET and POST:
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6559f1.large.jpg"><img src="6559f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Superglobals
</p></div></div>

</p><p>This brings us to Superglobals a relatively new concept to
PHP. For example, the above diagram presents a slight problem: if
you're working with the variable $yourname, how do you know that
during your script it hasn't been redefined by one of these six
other methods of variable assignment by someone attempting to hack
into your script? For example, imagine having someone who has
managed to upload a PHP script to your web server that performs the
following
(<a href="http://packetstormsecurity.nl/web/php.hidden-vars.txt" target="_self">php
exploit</a> by Daniel Phoenix):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?phpsetcookie("test","../../../../../../etc/passwd");echo "cookie inserted";?&gt;
</pre><p>Wouldn't it be great to have a way to isolate variables based
on how the data gets assigned in the first place? Superglobals
allow you to specify which variables received by a specific method
should be used.</p><p>Superglobals are PHP's attempt at helping you determine where
a particular value comes from. If you haven't heard of this new
feature as of PHP 4.1.0, you'll want to start adapting to it. Most
PHP training books don't touch this subject, so you will need to be
aware of how to transition to this new input method. Ultimately,
you should re-visit your /usr/local/lib/php.ini file and make the
following change:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
register_globals = Off
</pre><p>This will prevent the ability for any user-submitted variable
to be injected into your PHP code and can reduce the amount of
variable poisoning a potential attacker may inflict. They will have
to take the additional time to forge submissions, and your internal
variables are effectively isolated from user submitted data. If a
user then tried to fill out a form, the server wouldn't assign any
data to the global variables <b  >$name</b>,
<b  >$email</b> or <b  >$comment</b>. Instead,
it would divide up the data into the following hashed
arrays:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$_POST['name']$_POST['email']$_POST['comment']
</pre><p>The main Superglobal arrays are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>$_GET['<span   class="emphasis"><em>variable</em></span>'] - Variables
provided to the script via HTTP GET. Analogous to the deprecated
HTTP_GET_VARS array</p></li><li><p>$_POST['<span   class="emphasis"><em>variable</em></span>'] - Variables
provided to the script via HTTP POST. Analogous to the deprecated
$HTTP_POST_VARS array</p></li></ol></div><p>The other, less-common Superglobal arrays are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>$_COOKIE['<span   class="emphasis"><em>variable</em></span>'] -
Variables provided to the script via HTTP cookies. Analogous to the
deprecated $HTTP_COOKIE_VARS array</p></li><li><p>$_REQUEST['<span   class="emphasis"><em>variable</em></span>'] -
Variables provided to the script via any user input mechanism (GET,
POST, COOKIE) and which therefore cannot be trusted.</p></li><li><p>$_GLOBALS['<span   class="emphasis"><em>variable</em></span>'] -
Contains a reference to every variable which is currently available
within the global scope of the script. The keys of this array are
the names of the global variables.</p></li><li><p>$_SERVER['<span   class="emphasis"><em>variable</em></span>'] -
Variables set by the web server or otherwise directly related to
the execution environment of the current script. Analogous to the
deprecated $HTTP_SERVER_VARS array</p></li><li><p>$_FILES['<span   class="emphasis"><em>variable</em></span>'] -
Variables provided to the script via HTTP post file uploads.
Analogous to the deprecated $HTTP_POST_FILES array</p></li><li><p>$_ENV['<span   class="emphasis"><em>variable</em></span>'] - Variables
provided to the script via the environment. Analogous to the
deprecated $HTTP_ENV_VARS array</p></li><li><p>$_SESSION['<span   class="emphasis"><em>variable</em></span>'] -
Variables which are currently registered to a script's session.
Analogous to the deprecated $HTTP_SESSION_VARS array</p></li></ol></div><p>For more details, see
<a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.php" target="_self">www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.php</a>.</p><p>So instead of <b  >$name</b> being set to &ldquo;John&rdquo;,
you would either have <b  >$_GET['name'] = "John"</b> or
possibly <b  >$_POST['name'] = "John"</b> depending on
how the form data was submitted. The advantage is that you will
know:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>$name can never be faked; if your script sets its
value, that's the value!</p></li><li><p>The $_GET and $_POST arrays help you to determine
if the user appended the data as part of the URL or as part of the
request body; therefore you don't have to worry about having a form
accepting POST data and having the values change by someone sending
a hacked URL with GET data appended to the URL. This will make
sense shortly, so hang on...</p></li><li><p>These Superglobals allow you to compartmentalize
not only your variable's values, but also how the values were
provided to the server in the first place. Someone attempting to
hack into your server will have a very difficult time bypassing
this.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e4580.0x1dd6958"></a>Final Thoughts</h2></div></div><p>Programming with PHP can be a frustrating experience as of
late. Security measures prevent data from being easily assigned to
variables, ISPs typically implement PHP without consideration for
their audience, and newcomers to PHP tend to be taken aback by such
terms as GET, POST, Superglobals and so forth. However, a little
knowledge can go a long way, and hopefully this article has helped
you in your quest.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e4580.0x1dd6a60"></a>Resources</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><a href="http://softwaredev.earthweb.com/script/article/0,,12063_918141,00.html" target="_self">On
