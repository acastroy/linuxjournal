    A look at the themes, myths and clangers reported by the next
    crop of system administrators.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e31580.0x1f29240"></a></h2></div></div><p>At the start of this academic year
(September 2001), I was asked to teach a new module in my
Institute's B.Sc. degree program in Information Technology. This
final-year undergraduate module, entitled &ldquo;Network and Systems
Management&rdquo;, covers a wide range of system administration
technologies, practices and principles. In effect, students of the
module are the system administrators of the future.</p><p>As is probably the theme at the majority of third-level
educational establishments, student's exposure to OS technology at
the Institute of Technology, Carlow is Microsoft-focused and
desktop-based. This is easy to understand, for the desktop is very
much a Microsoft stronghold, and if an institution can use the same
PCs to teach business undergrads Excel and science undergrads
programming, then they will. However, what many of my students
often fail to recognize is that, as system administrators, they
will find themselves managing servers running OS technology other
than Microsoft's.</p><p>So in an attempt to expose my students to a more realistic
view of the technologies in use in the real world, I try to
deemphasize Microsoft's technologies in favor of the alternatives.
As you can imagine, Linux features quite heavily.</p><p>At the start of this academic year, I informally surveyed the
31 students enrolled in the module about their exposure to Linux.
Most (if not all) had some exposure to the OS. I probed further and
asked how many students had used Linux as the basis of their
third-year project (the previous year). One or two hands were
raised. Then the first shock came: someone blurted out, &ldquo;nearly
everyone who used Linux last year went on to fail their project&rdquo;.
It came out that a number of individuals were missing from the
final year due to failing the project element in year three. When I
probed for the root cause of the project-failing problem, I got my
second shock: &ldquo;Linux is too hard to install&rdquo;. I was shocked not
because these two statements were necessarily false but because
these 31 students had pretty much convinced themselves that success
was tied to Microsoft and failure to Linux.</p><p>While I covered Windows 2000 and Linux as case studies,
pointing out the advantages and disadvantages of each OS, I gave
the class an assignment that would require them to do some simple
research and, as a consequence, allow them to learn a little more
about Linux. The task was simple enough. I stated: &ldquo;Despite
considerable success as a server platform, Linux will never
threaten Microsoft Windows as a desktop operating system.&rdquo; I asked
the students to research the subject area, form an opinion as to
whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement, and then
present their case in no more than three A4 pages of typed text. As
I marked their assignments, a number of themes recurred.
Additionally, numerous myths became evident, and&mdash;perhaps not
unexpectedly&mdash;a number of blatant untruths presented themselves.
These I classified as <span   class="emphasis"><em>clangers</em></span>. In the
remainder of this article, I present the themes, myths and clangers
uncovered, in addition to my own personal commentary.</p><p>Note: for this purpose, I define a <span   class="emphasis"><em>theme</em></span>
as something that is generally agreed to be true. If a comment
occurred repeatedly throughout the students submissions, and it was
true, it became a theme. A <span   class="emphasis"><em>myth</em></span> is defined as
something generally held to be true but is, in fact, not true. Even
if a myth occurred repeatedly throughout the submissions (and many
did), it can't be a theme as it isn't true. A clanger is a
statement that is just blatantly wrong.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e31580.0x1f29608"></a>Themes</h2></div></div><p>The majority of my students felt that &ldquo;more desktop
applications are required for Linux&rdquo;. No argument here, the more
the merrier. And, Microsoft obviously has a distinct advantage in
this regard. This theme appeared in many different forms in the
student submissions. The most depressing (but still true) form was:
&ldquo;The average user does not care what operating system they are
using, just so long as it runs Microsoft Office.&rdquo; And Microsoft
knows this. The real crown jewel in the Microsoft arsenal is the
Office Suite. The fact that Redmond and Cupertino engineers have
already ported (most of) the Office technology to Mac OS X
indicates that a port to the X Window System would not be too
difficult. But let's face it, porting to Mac OS X on the
PowerPC-based Macintosh will never directly threaten the Windows
monopoly. Porting to Linux on x86 is an entirely different matter.
Were this to occur, the implications would be huge. This theme was
further generalized by one student as follows: &ldquo;The desktop
operating system with the most third-party software wins.&rdquo;</p><p>The students felt that &ldquo;The KDE/GNOME choice confuses most
newcomers to Linux.&rdquo; This frustration was also expressed as
follows: &ldquo;A commonly-agreed upon GUI environment is needed.&rdquo; Most
felt Microsoft has a definite edge here, as Windows 9x/ME/NT/2000
and now XP look <span   class="emphasis"><em>essentially</em></span> the same. There's
an argument that the choice of GUI (or desktop environment) is a
good thing in the Linux world. However, I'd have to side with my
students on this one, as I'd really like to see one single,
coherent GUI environment combining the best features of both KDE
and GNOME. There is nothing inherently wrong with all Linux desktop
GUIs looking the same, is there? And I suspect such an environment
would be welcomed by the vast majority of Linux GUI
trainers.</p><p>The students had plenty to say about the (lack of)
reliability in Windows. An eyebrow raising comment said, &ldquo;for the
sake of convenience and familiarity, most users will put up with
Windows crashing on a regular basis. In fact, everyone knows it's
quite normal for PCs to crash.&rdquo; A more general observation, along
the same lines, was, &ldquo;People like predictability, and they don't
like change, so they will put up with Windows' shortcomings.&rdquo; This
is a shame but it is true: it has become okay for a PC (running
Windows) to crash once a day (or more often). One student referred
to this as &ldquo;normal&rdquo; behavior. Like it or not, the average user
expects their PC to crash and are trained to switch it off then
back on again.</p><p>Compared to the infamous reliability of Windows, Linux did
well: &ldquo;Linux is technically superior to Windows: it runs longer and
consumes fewer resources. Linux also has better security, stability
and scalability.&rdquo; No argument on this front from me, either.
Unfortunately, the PC world is littered with dead technologies that
were technically superior to the alternatives available at the time
of their launch. Or perhaps I should have said &ldquo;dead companies&rdquo;. Of
course, it is not a company (like Netscape) that Microsoft is
trying to kill with its attacks on Linux, it's a community (which
is a little harder to kill). So, Microsoft's past tactics may not
(hopefully, <span   class="emphasis"><em>will not</em></span>) work.</p><p>A number of students highlighted the market perception of
Linux as a problem to be overcome: &ldquo;How can Linux really threaten
Windows on the desktop when the vast majority of PC users haven't
even heard of it?&rdquo;. Another slant on this was, &ldquo;The Windows
brandname is too strong to threaten&rdquo;, and &ldquo;The Linux community are
no match for the marketing machine that is Microsoft.&rdquo; This
visibility problem isn't helped by the fact that the mainstream
computing press have all but stopped covering Linux since the
dot-com bubble burst. The Windows brandname is as strong as
Coca-Cola, but the Coca-Cola brandname didn't stop Pepsi from
having a go (and doing quite well, too). Again, I think the
strength of the Linux community has bearing here, despite the fact
that a lot of my students thought that &ldquo;which desktop OS dominates
has more to do with marketing than technical expertise&rdquo;. Nearly
every student agreed that &ldquo;Linux needs to shake its image as the
techie/programmer's OS&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;Linux is seen as a geek's OS.
Programmers love it and that puts everyone else off.&rdquo; Yes, image
(market perception) is everything, and Microsoft knows this. This
helps explains the anti-Linux FUD campaign coming out of Redmond
these days.</p><p>The fact that Linux tends to run well on any old PC came in
for praise, typically as follows: &ldquo;Newer versions of Windows tend
to obsolete todays hardware. Linux, on the other hand, runs quite
well on older PCs.&rdquo; Yes, the new version of your chosen operating
system shouldn't require a major upgrade (or replacement) to the
hardware it runs on. If only more people would realize this, and
act on it.</p><p>More than one student had this warning for Microsoft: &ldquo;The
new XP licensing arrangements may result in many IT shops
reassessing their allegiance to Microsoft. Coming on the heels of
the recent economic downturn, this may hurt Microsoft to the
benefit of Linux.&rdquo; Yes, we should all be screaming this from the
tallest buildings we can find: users (i.e., IT managers) need to
resist Microsoft's attempts to &ldquo;lock 'em in&rdquo; as much as
possible!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e31580.0x1f299d0"></a>Myths</h2></div></div><p>A common misconception was &ldquo;The fact that Linux is
open-source is of no real consequence or benefit to the average
desktop user.&rdquo; Well, yes, the fact that the average desktop user
may never build a kernel from source (or change a line of code) may
mean that it is of no consequence to that individual desktop user
that the source is freely available. However, it is a huge benefit
to the average user to be able to leverage the excellent work that
others put into Linux (on their behalf) in order to improve the
core source code to the OS, and this benefit should
<span   class="emphasis"><em>never</em></span> be underestimated.</p><p>Knowing my GUI history, I tried not to let this next comment
upset me, &ldquo;Microsoft has more experience building Desktop OS and
GUI technology, so they should be better at it than anyone else.
After all, Microsoft invented the GUI.&rdquo; The good folks in Cupertino
will probably jump up and down in their seats if they read this,
not to mention the XFree86 and BeOS people. And we mustn't forget
Xerox PARC, where it all began. The last part of this myth really
should be a clanger.</p><p>A recurring complaint was that &ldquo;there are too many different
versions of Linux&rdquo;. No, not so. There's only one version of the
current Linux <span   class="emphasis"><em>kernel</em></span>. There may be too many
<span   class="emphasis"><em>distributions</em></span> of Linux, and I think it is safe
to say their differences cause confusion to Linux newcomers. (For
example, &ldquo;Why can't Debian load my Red Hat RPMs, after all, they're
both Linux, aren't they?&rdquo;).</p><p>Evidence that some of the Microsoft spin-doctoring is working
presented itself. Look at this comment: &ldquo;Linux isn't free. The
various distributors charge for their distributions, just like
Microsoft charges for its OS.&rdquo; True, if you attempt to acquire Red
Hat Linux at your local computer superstore, you won't get it for
free. But you can download Red Hat for free over the Internet. Try
that with Windows XP (legally, that is).</p><p>After shaking my head at that last comment, I came upon this
(from more than one student): &ldquo;Windows is essentially free. After
all, it's included with a new PC when you buy it.&rdquo; Well, anyone
that buys a PC from a PC manufacturer and asks for a blank
hard-drive, as opposed to one with Windows ME preinstalled, would
be a fool to pay the same amount for a PC with ME installed,
wouldn't they? So, Microsoft certainly gets its share when the
manufacturer sells you a PC with a Microsoft OS preinstalled. It
may be convenient for desktop users, but it is not free.</p><p>Some students think Microsoft has nothing to worry about,
because &ldquo;Linux's success has been at the expense of the proprietary
UNIX systems.&rdquo; If this were a true statement, Microsoft
<span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> would have nothing to worry about.
Thing is, it is not a true statement. Yes, there are some people
replacing aging AIX boxes (and the like) with Linux PCs, but to
think that's the only use for Linux is somewhat blinkered. And then
there's Samba, which&mdash;in my view&mdash;is a piece of software that
Microsoft would dearly love to see go away.</p><p>In addition to the usual &ldquo;Linux is too hard to install&rdquo;
rubbish, this was a common complaint, &ldquo;The Linux command line is
hard to learn and use.&rdquo; No, it simply is not. The Linux
user-interface came in for further unwarranted bashing (no pun
intended), &ldquo;Linux GUIs are slow.&rdquo; Well, this really depends on the
hardware you're running on, doesn't it? To put Linux on an old PC
(which can no longer run the latest Microsoft OS) and then complain
when the Linux GUI runs slowly is just not comparing apples with
apples, no matter what way you look at it.</p><p>Remarkably, many students stated the following as gospel:
&ldquo;Microsoft produce high quality software products.&rdquo; Which helps
explain why the Windows OS never crashes, doesn't it? Let's face
it, if Microsoft produced cars, and their brakes failed once a day
without warning, there would be no Microsoft. Some went as far as
to say that &ldquo;Microsoft are the trendsetters in the desktop OS
arena, so they will always come out on top.&rdquo; The truth is Microsoft
has made a fortune out of copying and popularizing the ideas of
others, but this doesn't make Redmond the trendsetters.</p><p>Then came the following contentious statements (from the
majority of my students): &ldquo;Linux offers no customer support, unlike
Microsoft, which has a great support system&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Microsoft's
technical support is the best in the industry and is superior to
that offered by the Linux community.&rdquo; I asked my 31 students how
many had called Microsoft's customer support. Only one had, and he
went on to say that Microsoft had put him on hold for &ldquo;a few hours&rdquo;
before even talking to him. He didn't seem to see the problem with
this! Again, it was seen as &ldquo;normal&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e31580.0x1f29ef8"></a>Clangers</h2></div></div><p>There's not much to say by way of commentary here, as these
statements speak for themselves.</p><p>Clanger #1: &ldquo;Linux will never threaten Windows on the desktop
because it is command line driven and doesn't even have a GUI&rdquo;.
What can I say?</p><p>Clanger #2: &ldquo;Linux has poor device-driver support and doesn't
even support USB&rdquo;. Not so, officially, as of the 2.4 kernel
(regarding USB). And driver support with Linux gets better every
single day.</p><p>Clanger #3: &ldquo;Linux lacks good software development tools,
unlike Windows which has plenty.&rdquo; It's hard to comment on this
without imagining the good folk at the Free Software Foundation
blowing their collective tops at the very idea that someone could
think (let alone say or print) such a thing. Also, despite the fact
that Visual C++ is the &ldquo;industry leader&rdquo; when it comes to C++
development on PCs, my experience with final year software
engineering undergraduates indicates that Visual C++ is a dog of an
environment to work with.</p><p>And the final clanger was that many of my students thought
Linux was a company!</p><p>Now, I'm the first to admit that my informal survey of these
31 students may be flawed (from a statistical sampling
point-of-view). However, I'd bet that the views and opinions
expressed by my students are typical and representative. My
original goal in setting the assignment was realized: my students
now have a better understanding and appreciation of what Linux
is.</p><p>Of course, I was shocked by some of the views of my students.
However, on reflection, I'm not surprised that some of the views
were voiced. Microsoft can afford to throw a lot of money into its
&ldquo;Linux Myth Campaign&rdquo;. And, as everyone knows, if you throw enough
of something, some of it is bound to stick. Education is a, if not
<span   class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span>, key defense mechanism.</p><p>And, what about my own view? I feel that although Linux may
never threaten Windows as a desktop OS, increasingly it is becoming
a viable alternative.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Paul Barry</b></span> lectures at the
