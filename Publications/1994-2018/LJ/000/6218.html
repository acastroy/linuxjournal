    The CARP and LOC rulings that became law on July 8 impose costs

    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bf580.0x2ab72f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>On May 22, the
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/homepage/greeting.html" target="_self">Librarian of
Congress, James H. Billington</a>, on the recommendation of
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/homepage/greeting.html" target="_self">Marybeth
Peters, Register of Copyrights</a>, issued an Order
<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/carp/webcasting-rates-order.html" target="_self">rejecting</a>
the licensing rates and terms for webcasting that were recommended
by the
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright/carp/webcasting_rates.html" target="_self">Copyright
Arbitration Royalty Panel (CARP)</a> on February 22. The rates
and terms had been regarded by internet radio broadcasters as a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>de facto</em></span> death sentence.</p><p>Webcasters rejoiced. By nearly all accounts at the time,
<a href="../000/6097.html" target="_self">including my own</a>, common sense
had prevailed. The lone dissenter was Jonathan Peterson of Way.Nu,
who
<a href="http://www.way.nu/archives/000236.html#000236" target="_self">wrote</a>,
&ldquo;While good news for webcasters, I wouldn't be breaking out the
champagne just yet. You can damn well bet that
<a href="http://www.riaa.org/index.cfm" target="_self">RIAA</a> and the
labels are already filling up Congresscritter appointment books to
apply some pressure.&rdquo;</p><p>One month later, Peterson proved a prophet.</p><p>On June 20, to the astonishment of just about everybody other
than the RIAA and
<a href="http://www.soundexchange.com/qanda.cfm" target="_self">SoundExchange</a>
(which will collect the new royalties), the Librarian of Congress
came out with a
<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/carp/webcasting_rates_final.html" target="_self">Final
Determination</a> that differed from the CARP original only in
the degree of death its sentence imposed. It dropped the $.0014
charged per stream for &ldquo;Internet only&rdquo; broadcasts down to $.0007
for all webcasters and commercial radio stations also broadcasting
over the Web. Performance fees were dropped from 9% to 8.8%.
Charges for webcasting noncommercial radio stations were held to
$.0002 per stream.</p><p>On July 8, 2002, the
<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/carp/webcast_regs.html" target="_self">Determination
of Reasonable Rates and Terms for the Digital Performance of Sound
Recordings and Ephemeral Recordings; Final Rule</a> was entered
into the Federal Register.</p><p>If you're a webcaster, payment for everything you've played,
for every single one of your listeners since October 28, 1998, is
due on October 20, 2002, whether you're still broadcasting or not.
If you want to stay on the air and pay the price for trespassing in
this new regulated marketplace, the clock starts running on
September 1, 2002. Forty-five days later, you'll owe for that first
month, and you'll pay within 45 days for every month that
follows.</p><p>For a station with 2,000 listeners playing 15 songs per hour,
the math looks like this:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>15 x $.0007 = $.0105 per listener/hour</p></li><li><p>$.0105 x 2000 = $21 for 2000 listeners in an
hour</p></li><li><p>$21 x 24 = $504 per day</p></li><li><p>$504 x 365.25 = $184,086 per year</p></li></ul></div><p>That bottom line exceeds the gross revenues of every internet
radio station today (if anybody knows a station making more, please
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>). It almost
certainly exceeds the additional revenues made by over-the-air
stations that also broadcast on the Net. These costs also will
surely bankrupt many of the individual broadcasters that have been
pioneering this marketplace for the longest time. And even the
lower rates ($.0002/stream) charged to noncommercial broadcasters
are far higher than nearly all of them can afford. (WXYC, the first
station to broadcast over the Net, has an annual budget of $20,000.
<a href="http://www.wxyc.org/CARPresponse.html" target="_self">Here's the
station's response</a> to the CARP ruling.)</p><p>Not surprisingly, there is a growing list of departed
stations, including <a href="http://somafm.com" target="_self">SomaFM</a>,
<a href="http://www.grrl.com/blogjune2002.html" target="_self">GrrlRadio</a>,
<a href="http://www.koit.com/koit/index.cfm" target="_self">KOIT</a>,

<a href="http://waaf.com" target="_self">WAAF</a> and
<a href="http://www.wmmr.com/new_listenlive.shtml" target="_self">WMMR</a>.
But it runs in the dozens.</p><p>Meanwhile,
<a href="http://www.live365.com" target="_self">Live365</a> continues to
host more than 40,000 stations. Every station on the
<a href="../000/5901.html" target="_self">list of favorites I wrote about on March
12</a> is still on the air (I just checked). So are
<a href="../000/5815.html" target="_self">the ones I listed one month
earlier</a>. The number of stations in
<a href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Arts/Music/Sound_Files/MP3/Streaming/Stations" target="_self">Google's
directory</a> also has not diminished.</p><p>Clearly these webcasters have faith in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>something</em></span>. Could it be <span   class="emphasis"><em>the
marketplace?</em></span></p><p>Unlike the commercial radio stations we hear on the
old-fashioned airwaves, Internet radio stations' primary market
relationship isn't with advertisers; it's with listeners. In many
cases (<a href="http://www.radioparadise.com" target="_self">Radio
Paradise</a> is a <a href="../000/5725.html" target="_self">good
example</a>), the listeners are the primary source of revenue.
This business model is similar to that of noncommercial (public)
radio, only the market relationship is much more direct and
efficient. Internet radio stations don't need to stop programming
to hold marathon whine-fests begging listeners to call phone
volunteers and pledge money to qualify for a mug or a t-shirt.
Listeners simply click on a PayPal or an Amazon link, and after a
few more clicks they've made a payment.</p><p>This market relationship is entirely voluntary, of course.
There are still plenty of free-riding listeners. But there are
good-faith buyer/seller relationships involved, and it is easily
conceivable that, over time, these relationships will call forth
the technologies required to support natural valuation, pricing and
payment mechanisms. Given the resourcefulness, entrepreneurial
spirit and technological know-how of many internet broadcasters,
the emergence of a real and functioning &ldquo;willing buyer/willing
seller&rdquo; marketplace is bound to occur.</p><p>But this was not obvious to the CARP, the RIAA, the LOC or
other parties to the proceedings, for the simple reason that the
most resourceful webcasters were busy rolling their own solutions
without much help from commercial software or hosting companies
(with a few notable exceptions, such as
<a href="http://www.shoutcast.com/support/docs/docs.phtml?filenumber=30&amp;language=english&amp;layout=normal&amp;prevlayout=normal" target="_self">Shoutcast</a>
and Live365).</p><p>But missing market clues was built into the DMCA in the first
place. That's why the DMCA provided these instructions (now
<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#114" target="_self">burned
into copyright law</a>):</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The copyright arbitration royalty panel shall
establish rates and terms that most clearly represent the rates and
terms that <span   class="emphasis"><em>would have been negotiated in the marketplace
between a willing buyer and a willing seller</em></span>. In
determining such rates and terms, the copyright arbitration royalty
panel shall base its decision on economic, competitive and
programming information presented by the parties. (The italics are
mine.)</p></blockquote></div><p>One of those parties was
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com" target="_self">Yahoo!</a>, which
<a href="http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3_90621" target="_self">paid
$5.7 billion</a> for Mark Cuban's Broadcast.com in 1999. In
those days Yahoo! had big plans for internet radio. Yahoo! was also
by far the largest entity on the webcasting side of the arbitration
process, and the one spending the most money to develop the
&ldquo;space&rdquo;. So it made some kind of sense for the CARP to base its
&ldquo;willing buyer/willing seller&rdquo; thinking on Yahoo!'s plans.</p><p>But the results are grandiose and absurd. Worse, the results
are now law.
<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/carp/webcast_regs.html#yahoo" target="_self">Here's
the relevant excerpt from the Final Determination</a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>5. The Yahoo! rates&mdash;evidence of a unitary
marketplace value.
</p><p>The starting point for setting the rates for the webcasting
license is the Yahoo! agreement. In that agreement, rates were set
for two different time periods. For the initial time period
covering the first 1.5 billion performances, Yahoo! agreed to pay
one lump sum of $1.25 million. From this information, the Panel
calculated a &ldquo;blended,&rdquo; per performance rate of 0.083&cent;. This
value represents the actual price that Yahoo! paid for each of the
first 1.5 billion transmissions without regard to which type of
service made the transmission. For the second time period, Yahoo!
and RIAA agreed to a differential rate structure. One rate was set
for performances in radio retransmissions (RR) (0.05&cent; per
performance) and another rate was set for transmissions in
Internet-only (IO) programming (0.2&cent; per performance). These
rates were first used in early 2000 and do not apply to the first
1.5 billion performances.</p><p>However, the CARP did not accept these differentiated rates
at face value. The Panel engaged in a far-ranging inquiry to
determine how the parties established the negotiated rates. What it
found was that Yahoo! agreed to a higher rate for the IO
transmissions in exchange for a lower rate for the RR because this
arrangement addressed specific concerns of both parties. In
particular, RIAA wished to establish a marketplace precedent for IO
transmissions in line with rates it had negotiated in earlier
agreements, while Yahoo! sought to negotiate rates which, in the
aggregate, yielded a rate it could accept. Consequently, the Panel
found the rate for the IO transmissions to be artificially high
and, conversely, the rates for the RR to be artificially low. For
this reason, it made a downward adjustment to the IO rates and an
upward adjustment to the RR rates.</p><p>Before making this adjustment, though, the Panel had to
consider whether it was reasonable to establish separate rates for
the two categories of transmissions. In reaching its decision, the
Panel considered two facts, the fact that the Yahoo! agreement
provided for two separate rates, and the fact that all parties
agreed that performances of sound recordings in over-the-air radio
broadcasts promote the sale of records. Report at 74. Based on this
finding, the Panel concluded that a willing buyer and a willing
seller would agree that the value of the performance right for RR
would be considerably lower than for IO transmissions. Moreover, it
attributed the existence of the rate differential in the Yahoo!
agreement to the promotional value enjoyed by the copyright owners
from the performance of the sound recordings by broadcasters in
their over-the-air programs, and not to promotional value
attributable to transmissions made over the Internet. Report at
74-75. Specifically, the Panel found that, &ldquo;to the extent that
Internet simulcasting of over-the-air broadcasts reaches the same
local audience with the same songs and the same DJ support, there
is no record basis to conclude that the promotional effect is any
less.&rdquo; Report at 75.</p></blockquote></div><p>Fine. Except now it's July 2002, and Yahoo! is out of the
broadcasting business. (Go to
<a href="http://broadcast.com" target="_self">Broadcast.com</a> and see
what it says before your browser gets redirected away.) In fact,
Yahoo! was <span   class="emphasis"><em>already</em></span> out of that business when
the LOC reviewed the CARP recommendations for the final time
between May 20 and June 20, 2002. Yet the LOC let those
recommendations stand.</p><p>Think about it. Yahoo!'s original &ldquo;deal&rdquo;--the CARP's starting
point for imagining a real-world market&mdash;is worse than unproved: it
never happened. The CARP might have learned something if Yahoo! had
tried and failed, but its efforts were stillborn. Without Mark
Cuban's entrepreneurial savvy to guide them, and without sky-high
stock valuations to encourage and fund all kinds of expensive
market experiments, Yahoo! simply gave up and wrote the whole thing
off.</p><p>Meanwhile, internet radio is being regulated on the basis of
Yahoo!'s abandoned ambitions.</p><p>The feeble quality of the CARP/LOC due diligence work was
fully revealed by
<a href="http://www.kurthanson.com/archive/news/062402/index.asp" target="_self">Mark
Cuban's e-mail to Kurt Hansen of RAIN</a>, the Radio and
Internet Newsletter, after the LOC's Final Determination. Here's
the full text of that e-mail:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>It's very interesting that they built this on the Yahoo!/RIAA
deal.</p><p>When I was still there (the final deal was signed after I
left Yahoo!), I hated the price points and explained why they were
too high. HOWEVER, I was trying to get concession points from the
RIAA. Among those was that I, as Broadcast.com, didn't want
percent-of-revenue pricing.</p><p>Why? Because it meant every &ldquo;Tom , Dick, and Harry&rdquo; webcaster
could come in and undercut our pricing because we had revenue and
they didn't. Broadcasters could run ads for free and try to make it
up in other areas so they wouldn't have to pay royalties.</p><p>As an extension to that, I also wanted there to be an
advantage to aggregators. If there was a charge per song, it's
obvious lots of webcasters couldn't afford to stay in business on
their own. THEREFORE, they would have to come to Broadcast.com to
use our services because with our aggregate audience, if the price
per song was reasonable, we could afford to pay the royalty AND get
paid by the web radio stations needing to webcast.</p><p>More importantly&mdash;and of course I didn't tell the RIAA
this&mdash;we had a big multicast network (remember multicasting? Yahoo!
didn't seem to after I left). Well, multicasting only sends a
single stream from our server, so that is what we would record in
our reports for the RIAA, and that is what we would pay on.</p><p>So that was the logic going into the Yahoo!/RIAA deal. I
wasn't there when it was signed, but I'm guessing and I've been
told that there weren't dramatic changes.</p><p>Now, no one asked me any of these things prior, during, or
after the first or second pricing. I'm not sure that this matters.
But if it does, here it is: The Yahoo! deal I worked on, if it
resembles the deal the CARP ruling was built on, was designed so
that there would be less competition, and so that small webcasters
who needed to live off of a &ldquo;percentage-of-revenue&rdquo; to survive,
couldn't.</p><p>There you have it, if anyone cares.</p><p>Mark CubanDallas Mavericks</p></blockquote></div><p>So the <span   class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> plan was to squash the
little guys and o play rope-a-dope with regulators by funneling
many streams into only one, so Yahoo! would spread the cost of one
stream across hundreds or even thousands. Nice, huh? How come the
CARP panel didn't pick <span   class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> up in its &ldquo;far
ranging inquiry&rdquo;? Mark Cuban's a talkative guy. Did they even
bother to ask him about it?</p><p>In &ldquo;<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/777023.asp" target="_self">Labels
to Net Radio: Die Now</a>&rdquo;, in the current (July 15, 2002)
issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Newsweek</em></span>, Steven Levy writes,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>So why are the record labels taking such a hard line? My
guess is that it's all about protecting their Internet-challenged
business model. Their profit comes from blockbuster artists. If the
industry moved to a more varied ecology, independent labels and
artists would thrive&mdash;to the detriment of the labels, which would
have trouble rustling up the rubes to root for the next Britney.
The smoking gun comes from testimony of an RIAA-backed economist
who told the government fee panel that a dramatic shakeout in
Webcasting is &ldquo;inevitable and desirable because it will bring about
market consolidation.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Which gives us CARP/LOC's final solution:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>consolidate the market to zero</em></span>.</p><p>This idea became even more clear to me on June 21, when I
talked with
<a href="http://www.howardgreenstein.com/blog" target="_self">Howard
Greenstein</a> on the phone. I first met Howard in the summer
of 1996, when he was an Internet radio pioneer, running a startup
that fielded a whole fleet of stations. Howard later moved on to
other things, but he learned a lot about internet radio business
models in those pioneering days, and he has followed the whole
CARP/LOC process with growing astonishment.</p><p>&ldquo;There's no business model&rdquo;, he told me. The DMCA, the CARP
and the LOC all conceive webcasts as &ldquo;performances&rdquo;, and insist on
pay-per-song royalties, yet there is little or nothing in reality
to suggest that hearing an MP3 stream is worth anything more than
zero to a listener. The royalty rates also are set so high that
stations would have to charge a 20x advertising premium (over a
nominal $10 cost per thousand), which barely cover the costs of
playing a few songs between ads, ruling out advertising as
well.</p><p>So, if you rule out pay-per-listen and advertising, what's
left? The short answer is <span   class="emphasis"><em>nothing</em></span>: just a
fenced-off space with severe fines for trespassers. The long answer
is <span   class="emphasis"><em>let's see</em></span>: give the pioneers and their
customers a chance to work something out.</p><p>But the long answer wasn't the one the lawmakers and
regulators wanted to hear. They were working on behalf of what Joni
Mitchell
<a href="http://www.jonimitchell.com/HitsParis74.html" target="_self">calls</a>
&ldquo;the star-maker machinery behind the popular song&rdquo;: namely, the
record industry and the commercial radio business it
<a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/feature/2001/03/14/payola/index.html" target="_self">pays</a>
to help manufacture and promote blockbuster artists. Since the
money collected from internet radio will be divided up according to
record sales, most of the income will go to blockbuster
artists&mdash;not to the actual artists whose songs are streamed by the
stations (even though the new law requires that stations keep
<a href="http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/webcasting.html" target="_self">unbelievably
detailed records</a> of what's being played, along with a
mountain of other information, and even though the technologies for
capturing and organizing all this information do not yet
exist).</p><p>We customarily think of markets as cold, hard &ldquo;forces&rdquo;. But
in fact, most people, given a choice, go into business to do what
they love. And in some business categories, such as music,
customers love the goods as much as the vendors do.</p><p>Internet radio as we know it today&mdash;what the RIAA and the
Librarian of Congress want to kill off&mdash;is mostly by and for people
who love music. To a significant degree this was also true of
commercial radio, even up to its golden age, which on AM ended in
the 60s and on FM ended in the 80s. What killed music-loving radio
was
<a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/clear_channel" target="_self">bean-counting
at all costs</a>. And now it's about to strangle internet radio
in the cradle.</p><p>Maybe, if enough of us love music and radio as much as these
webcasters do, we can find a way to stop this insanity.</p><p>Where to start? Visit
