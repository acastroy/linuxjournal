    A look at the success of Linux in schools, and how it should
    constitute the model for state and local government.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2379580.0x2471240"></a></h2></div></div><p><a href="http://www.k12linux.org" target="_self">K12
Linux</a> may be the mecca of open-source success. As school
districts represent a part of state and local government, one has
to wonder how their many case studies are practically unknown. As
other sectors of state and local governments struggle with budget
deficits, political pressure and uncertainty, Linux school projects
represent tangible progress and offer empirical evidence of
success.</p><p>If one wanted to find information about the use of Linux in
state government, where would one go? The first thought would be an
Internet search engine. Any combination of search terms for state
government, though, return a chaotic mess.</p><p>If one wants to find information about Linux in schools, a
search engine would take you to cyber foundries such as
<a href="http://schoolforge.net/index.php" target="_self">SchoolForge</a>.
Once there, you would find the information, tools and materials
necessary to forge or make a school and all its parts. If such
sites existed for government, we could see more tangible progress
and empirical evidence of success for the entire Open Source
community.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2379580.0x24714a8"></a>Government Applications, School
Applications</h2></div></div><p>State and local governments need software applications for
numerous tasks, including administration, finance, public works,
law enforcement, courts, regulatory compliance, record management,
facilities and transportation. The catalog of application
requirements might surprise even the most sophisticated
consultants. In most government units, facilities exist for
services and communication between 1) government and citizens, 2)
government and businesses and 3) government and other
governments.</p><p>To gain perspective on the broad scope and complexity of
government processes, you can use the federal
<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/egov/2003egov_strat.pdf" target="_self">Management
Agenda Document</a>. Start at section 5.3 in the document's
appendix and continue toward the end. From these pages, you can get
an idea of the applications required to run at the federal level.
Scale each of those down to the state, county and city levels, and
the functional requirements still remain large. For example,
consider a searchable land deed database at the county level. Add a
marriage database and another one for divorces, one for driving
infractions, one for birth certificates and another for tax
assessments, and you can begin to understand the scope.</p><p>Let's change the picture for a moment; imagine a web site for
government applications. Instead of building one from scratch, we
can put up a LAMP application for each government function that
others can download. Suddenly, you have a resource center. If
someone needs a 911-call center application, they probably could
choose from several.</p><p>In the K12Linux domain, if you need an application, you
probably would stop at SchoolForge and then click the link to the
<a href="http://richtech.ca/seul" target="_self">Seul/Edu Educational
Application Index</a> to discover a repository of applications.
Here you can find 80 administrative applications that one can
download, plus 98 language programs and more. The site contains 612
open-source applications in 23 categories, such as courseware, math
and library applications. And that's only one of several K12Linux
web sites.</p><p>Imagine such a collection of government software somewhere.
If we added a news site and resource center, a mailing list and
<a href="http://faqomatic.sourceforge.net/fom-serve/cache/1.html" target="_self">Faq-O-Matic</a>,
we would create a community of interest. Linux people already know
what community-of-interest web sites accomplish.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2379580.0x2471818"></a>The Kindergarten through 12th Grade (K12) Linux
Projects</h2></div></div><p>If you haven't looked at the K12 web sites, you might have a
difficult time visualizing how much Linux has grown. You should
want to dig deeply into the sites, as they provide rich content. To
begin, the
<a href="http://schoolforge.net/members.php" target="_self">SchoolForge
members' page</a> provides an impressive list of people working
in the Linux school projects.</p><p>Once you've visited this SchoolForge site, you might have a
confusing moment when you visit the other
<a href="http://opensourceschools.org" target="_self">Schoolforge site</a>.
The URLs are different, but the names have only a slight
difference. The second site's full name is Schoolforge News and
Journal; notice the lowercase f in this name. The SchoolForge site
appears to exist in New York state, and the registrant is Teachers
Internet Pages. The Schoolforge site appears to be based in Canada
under the name of members.iteachnet.org. The two sites do share
content.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2379580.0x2471a28"></a>Oregon Schools Proven Linux Saves Money</h2></div></div><p>One has to wonder if Northwest school districts took ostrich
lessons; they must represent the biggest secret in the Linux
community. If their successes occurred in New York, Microsoft would
be fighting for 5% of the PC desktop share.</p><p>In Portland, Oregon Riverdale School began using Linux
servers in 1995. In turn, it influenced a number of other Oregon
schools to migrate to Linux. I learned of Riverdale whiling leading
an article about Linux migration for Centennial Schools, in late
1999.</p><p>We discovered that several large districts in Oregon followed
Riverdale's example. Those districts include Beaverton Schools, the
Multnomah County ESD, Linn-Benton-Lincoln ESD, Lane ESD, Parkrose
Schools, Portland Public Schools, Tigard-Tualatin Schools and
Umatilla-Morrow ESD. In a recent survey conducted by the North West
Regional Educational Laboratory, 79% of the sixty-four educational
agencies responding used Linux as a server operating system.</p><p>During the Centennial migration, we also learned of a case
involving the Multnomah County Education Service District (MESD).
MESD provides Internet connectivity for seven school serving
100,000 students in Multnomah County, Oregon. MESD network
administrators tested free software in 1998. They installed Linux
web proxy servers, realized savings from reduced bandwidth
utilization and had a positive ROI within six months. Even with
costs of bandwidth dropping since 1998, MESD continues to save
$10,000 annually.</p><p>MESD also replaced back office services with Linux. The
replacement applications included file, print, web, mail and domain
name services. The district report savings of $150,000 annually due
to reductions in software licenses, maintenance and reduced
personnel.</p><p>In addition, MESD migrated to an open-source web filtering
solution called SquidGuard and added a Linux firewall, for savings
of over $15,000 per year. Estimated overall savings run about $2
per student, or $200,000.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2379580.0x2471ce8"></a>Can You Explain the Oregon Legislature?</h2></div></div><p>In Texas, Senator Carona would have loved to show the
legislature the kind of success in Texas school districts that was
experienced in the Northwest. When Oregon tried to pass open-source
legislation, it had support from special interest groups for
open-source software, plus the schools' track records.</p><p>Consider, then, that Oregon's information technology group
registered opposition to this open-source bill. Also consider that
the Speaker of the House killed the bill. We must not forget that
open-source software does not provide soft dollars for
politicians.</p><p>In short, Linux lacks a track record for open-source software
in government. The legislature in Oregon resembles most states in
the country. If Linux for government had the organization of the
K12 projects, perhaps Oregon could not have dismissed the open
source bill so easily, if at all.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2379580.0x2471ea0"></a>Welcome to the K12 Linux Terminal Server Project
Version 3.1</h2></div></div><p>The Texas Department of Information Resources (DIR) is
looking to become the first state IT department to fully embrace
open-source software. In its desire to move forward, it can look to
K12Linux for a &ldquo;killer app&rdquo;.</p><p>Of any available knowledge worker technology, the
<a href="http://k12ltsp.org/contents.html" target="_self">K12 Linux Terminal
Server Project</a> possesses the most potential for altering
the IT landscape. According to Paul Nelson, one of the creators of
the project, over 15,000 schools and businesses around the world
have downloaded the software since its release in 2001. Although
15,000 downloads is impressive, it represents only a tiny fraction
of the potential audience.</p><p>K12LTSP bases itself on Red Hat Linux and the
<a href="http://www.ltsp.org" target="_self">LTSP</a> terminal server
packages. The current version, 3.1.0, uses Red Hat 9.0 with updates
as the base distribution. K12LTSP 3.1.0 comes in a three CD-set and
contains software for creating a file server, terminal server or
single workstation. Did I mention it's free?</p><p>An impressive
<a href="http://k12ltsp.org/rhs_casestudy.html" target="_self">case
study</a> exists on the K12LTSP web site, featuring the
aforementioned Riverdale High School. Riverdale runs version 3.0 of
K12LTSP. The school installed eighty diskless workstations and four
application servers, with an average cost of $500. Riverdale
reported a savings of 50% over the cost of traditional hardware
alone, not including software.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2379580.0x24721b8"></a>Terminal Server Excitement</h2></div></div><p>As many readers know, government clients have a healthy
appetite for thin client technology. And, in many businesses, I see
Compaq T30 Evo thin clients struggling for air while connected to
Windows 2000 terminal servers. Therefore, Linux solutions have much
appeal because they can run Windows applications if
necessary.</p><p>The story on thin clients includes lower cost of IT
management, because administrators can focus on a few servers
instead of thousands of PCs across hundreds of miles. They also
provide terminal emulation for connecting directly to legacy
systems and graphical applications. Finally, one runs into trouble
attempting to deny the total costs of ownership benefits.</p><p>The city of Largo, Florida finished its terminal server
project with diskless workstations in April 2002. The city runs
server-based Linux applications on thin-client hardware to save
money, minimize support headaches and ease IT budgeting. Largo's
systems administrator considered PCs too expensive and management
intensive. He did not see them meeting the appropriate level of
fiscal responsibility in government. When the time came to migrate
from older terminals, the city decided to set up a graphical
environment using thin clients.</p><p>Largo's 900 city employees have user accounts on a network of
<a href="http://www.ncd.com/products/hardware/explora/400ds.html" target="_self">400
Explora 451</a> thin clients from Network Computing Devices
Inc. On the server side, two Compaq servers&mdash;a 933MHz
dual-processor ML370 and a 1GHz dual-processor ML350&mdash;run Red Hat
Linux and support about 220 concurrent users. Largo estimates that
using Linux saves the city at least $1 million a year in hardware,
software licensing, maintenance and staff costs.</p><p>In Houston, thin client terminals have become the prevalent
platform for knowledge workers. Last week, I reported that Houston
went with the SimDesk productivity suite running over Web-enabled
protocols. I forgot to mention the thin client terminals.</p><p>Demand for thin clients and terminal servers is good news for
Linux enthusiasts. With the move toward web service applications
and Microsoft's .NET framework, Linux competes nicely. Demand
already exists for Linux commercial vendors, ISVs and
consultants.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2379580.0x24724d0"></a>Time's Up</h2></div></div><p>One can only hope that Linux advocates organize government
web sites similar to the K12 sites we discussed above. While an
associate of mine has written that Texas is ground zero for Linux
adoption in government, I notice the DIR already has established a
<a href="http://216.61.35.115/governmentdomain/Search.asp" target="_self">software
sharing database</a>. It has received the following
<a href="http://216.61.35.115/governmentdomain/Testimonials.asp" target="_self">testimonial</a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The Automobile Theft Prevention Authority at the
Texas Department of Transportation was seeking a system to track
and monitor Grant Applications to replace an existing system that
no longer worked or met their needs. Through GovernmentDomain.com
they were able to re-deploy the Grant Tracking System which had
previously been developed with state funds at the office of the
Governor. This approach saved them time and money and was able to
be implemented quickly. The only resource required by the users at
TxDOT to implement the system was time from one developer. Once the
user requirements for slight alterations to the system were
identified, they were able to deploy the system in a couple of
months.
</p><p>I must say the functionality in the system was flexible and
extensive compared to what we had, and the Automobile Theft
Prevention Authority is very pleased with the benefits of
implementing this system.</p><p>Bob Brown - Information Systems Division
Programmer/Analyst</p></blockquote></div><p>I hope this concept sets a precedent, and we all can look
forward to cooperation among the states. Texas has made a start and
that's a good thing. Now, let's all get to work.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2379580.0x2472840"></a>Resources</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://richtech.ca/seul" target="_self">The SEUL/Edu Educational
