popular Linux book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span>, most of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>'s readers probably either own or
have access to an earlier edition. Nevertheless, there are some
differences of note between the previous editions and the new, 4th
edition of this Linux staple. These differences not only make
replacing your old copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span>
worthwhile, but they indicate some interesting developments in the
Linux community.</p><p>A Matter of Language</p><p>The 4th edition has a subtle but important shift in attitude
that is evident in its language. Whereas in earlier editions, Linux
was referred to as &ldquo;a free Unix clone&rdquo; (3rd Ed., pg. 1), the 4th
edition refers to Linux as &ldquo;a free, open source operating system&rdquo;.
This simple change in word usage&mdash;seen throughout the
book&mdash;suggests that the Linux community views Linux quite
differently from a mere 18 months ago, when the 3rd edition was
published. We have come to see Linux as separate and distinct; we
no longer rely on the various manifestations of UNIX to define it.
&ldquo;People are not viewing Linux as <span   class="emphasis"><em>just another
Unix</em></span> any longer; it's viewed as an operating system in
its own right&rdquo;, says one of the authors, Kalle Dalheimer. In
essence, it has reached adulthood.</p><p>Linux is not in isolation and independent, however.
Certainly, it has ceased to be dependent on the UNIX operating
systems out of which it originally grew. Instead, as the new
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span>'s opening line suggests, it has
become interdependent with the GNU Open Source community. Both
complement each other while not strictly relying on each other. For
instance, the open-source database MySQL thrives in the Linux
world, but it competes quite well as a database for other operating
systems. At the same time, a Linux web server is greatly enhanced
when a MySQL system is deployed with it, but it could just as
easily make use of some other database. However, Linux and MySQL
help each other grow as a result of their interdependent
relationship.</p><p>To this end, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> no longer
dedicates a section to the &ldquo;Differences Between Linux and Other
Operating Systems&rdquo; (3rd Ed., pg. 31), wherein comparisons are made
to Microsoft Windows and commercial UNIX systems. This is clearly a
shift to a non-apologetic attitude regarding Linux. In fact, the
authors have added to their list of reasons why people like Linux
the previously unlikely reason of &ldquo;It's sexy&rdquo;. Linux has come a
long way from its obscure role of the little hobbyist OS that
thought it could.</p><p>Tried and True Style</p><p>As the descendant of Matt Welsh's classic book from the early
1990s, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Installation &amp; Getting
Started</em></span>, the new edition of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running
Linux</em></span> possesses the familiar and casual style of writing
of Welsh's first text. Although Welsh's role has diminished over
the years with the introduction of three additional contributors to
this project, they have retained the simplistic style that made
Welsh's first book so popular and Linux thereby accessible.</p><p>The authors of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> have not
gone the way of many computer books these days, explaining how to
configure Linux with graphical interfaces. These GUI configuration
programs are slick and can be helpful, particularly for those first
starting out with Linux. However, I think system administrators and
would-be administrators need to know how to configure Linux
machines from the command prompt. It gives one better control and a
better understanding of the system. Too many Linux components are
intertwined with one another to strictly rely on GUI configuration
programs to take care of everything. &ldquo;Sooner or later they will
either be not powerful enough or simply break, and then you will be
glad if you know how to do it the manual way&rdquo;, says Dalheimer,
who's located in Germany. Troubleshooting and solving system
problems is far easier if one has taken the time over the years to
learn system settings at their basic levels. Also, there's the
matter of server accessibility. Many times, I've had to resolve
server problems while I was out of town and had to use someone's MS
Windows computer. With only secure shell terminal access on a
machine without X, you'll wish you knew the commands and
configuration files.</p><p>One complaint I do have about <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running
Linux</em></span> is the amount of redundant comments. However, I
don't know what the authors can do about it. When covering
complicated topics, invariably there will be connections to other
aspects of Linux. Rather than elaborate on related topics in each
section, the authors and editors choose to use notations that refer
the reader to the related chapters. This is fine; however, such
references are sometimes made a few times in a brief section of
text. This can be wearing if one reads the text as I did, from
beginning to end. But in fairness to the authors, although the book
builds from one chapter to the next, they do not seem to assume
that most readers will read it sequentially. Dalheimer says, &ldquo;You
should be able to read through it from cover to cover, as well as
keep it on your desk afterwards and look up things.&rdquo; Therefore,
these comments are necessary to keep the text down to a minimum
length and so that the book may be used as a reference
manual.</p><p>Content</p><p>For those unfamiliar with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span>,
the content is excellent for beginners and for those who have been
at Linux for a while. All of the basics are explained quite well,
including the installation process, the filesystem, LILO
configuration, basic commands, software upgrades, rebuilding the
kernel and making backups. The authors also provide information to
help the new reader get started with text editors like Vi and
Emacs, in addition to advice on installing and configuring the X
Window System. As the new reader's Linux usage increases,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> provides hints on beginning to
program in popular open-source languages such as Perl and Java.
Tips on networking, Apache web service and setting up a mail server
also are provided.</p><p>In this new edition, the authors have added or increased
information on devices like laptops, video cards, scanners and
sound cards. They've reduced the information on services fading in
popularity, like bulletin boards, but have added information on new
items, such as ADSL, and have expanded their advice on network
security. I was saddened to see the programming languages of Tcl
and Tk lose ground in the 4th edition; in the 3rd they enjoyed a
section of their own in the programming chapter, consisting of
about a dozen pages. In the 4th edition they have been reduced to
less than a page of comments. But such hard choices have to be
made. &ldquo;The book already has reached a 'critical mass'; if it [were]
thicker, it would be more difficult to produce and hence have a
considerably higher retail price&rdquo;, says Dalheimer. In trade, the
authors did add a section on LAMP (Linux with Apache, MySQL and
PHP), though. Also, text on GNOME has been expanded and moved from
an appendix to the chapter on the X environment. The section on KDE
has been expanded, as well.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>As expected, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> continues to
be the excellent Linux tutorial and reference manual it always has
been. The authors and the editors at O'Reilly have ensured that it
stays current, without foregoing what's important in running a
Linux system. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> really is one of
the ultimate Linux manuals.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Russell J.T. Dyer</b></span> is a Perl
