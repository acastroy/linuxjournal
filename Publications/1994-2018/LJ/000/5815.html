wearing my winter headphones (the warm and beautiful
<a href="http://www.sel.sony.com/SEL/consumer/ss5/home/accessories/cdseriesheadphones/mdr-cd780.shtml" target="_self">Sony
MDR-CD780s</a>) and tuning down a long list of faraway radio
signals. I started with
<a href="http://www.kfjc.org" target="_self">KFJC</a>,
<a href="http://www.kpig.com" target="_self">KPIG</a>,
<a href="http://www.radioparadise.com" target="_self">RadioParadise</a> and
<a href="http://www.smoothjazz.com" target="_self">SmoothJazz</a>, which
are headquartered in California, where I live. Then I went to
<a href="http://www.wunc.org" target="_self">WUNC</a> out of Chapel Hill,
North Carolina and <a href="http://www.wcpe.org" target="_self">WCPE</a>
from nearby Raleigh. Then I moved across the waters to
<a href="http://www.radiofg.com" target="_self">Radio FG</a> from Paris,
<a href="http://www.urgent.rug.ac.be" target="_self">URGent</a> (&ldquo;De Gentse
Studentenradio&rdquo;), <a href="http://beirutnights.com" target="_self">Beiruit
Nights</a> and a bunch of other stuff from who knows where:
<a href="http://home.attbi.com/~radiofreeeric/freeklez.htm" target="_self">Radio
Free Klezmer</a>, <a href="http://radiostorm.com" target="_self">Radiostorm
Hip-Hop/R&amp;B</a>,
<a href="http://www.bassdrive.com" target="_self">BassDrive</a>, Chemlab,
<a href="http://www.cyberspacesonata.com" target="_self">Cyberspace
Sonata</a>, KI EuroDance and other stuff from
<a href="http://www.digitallyimported.com" target="_self">Digitally Imported
Radi</a><a href="http://www.digitallyimported.com" target="_self">o</a>,
<a href="http://www.factory188.com" target="_self">Factory188</a> and
<a href="http://www.flaresound.com" target="_self">FlareSOUND</a>. Plus I
found lots more that I didn't bother copying down but most of which
you can find in
<a href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Arts/Music/Sound_Files/MP3/Streaming/Stations" target="_self">Google's
directory</a>.</p><p>My radio was a laptop tuned into the home Wi-Fi signal, which
was routed to the Net over a 2+Mb cable link (yes, it's not
symmetrical, but no, it doesn't suck). Most of the stations listed
were broadcasting crystalline 128kb or better streams. Admittedly,
my setup is a <span   class="emphasis"><em>little</em></span> exotic but only by
proximity to a leading edge that's sure to pass quickly. DVDs were
once exotic, but last week I bought a player from
<a href="http://www.sonicblue.com/video/govideo/default.asp" target="_self">Go.Video</a>
at Costco for $79.95. In two years DVD <span   class="emphasis"><em>burners</em></span>
will cost the same.</p><p>For an old ham radio operator and broadcast band DXer like
me, the reality of the matter was a mind-bender. These signals
weren't rarities bouncing off the skies and seas, full of static
and hetrodyne whistles, audible only over an expensive radio that
required the hands of a safecracker to tune. They came out of a
pipe-like house current.</p><p>Most of these stations were clearly the products of
resourceful young people, routing around the rusting hulk of
terrestrial broadcasting, which remains almost entirely captive to
the record industry (commercial radio) or the public institutions
that hold their licenses (public radio). It's Napster all over
again, at least in the sense that it's file sharing. But there's a
significant difference in how the files move. This time we're not
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/crossload.html" target="_self">crossloading</a>
from one person's hard drive to another, nor are we downloading,
although some players do permit you to rip streams to files. We're
<span   class="emphasis"><em>broadcasting</em></span>, with the Net serving as both
medium and backchannel. I'll put it a different way:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>we're taking over the business.</em></span></p><p>If you're an ordinary broadcaster, it's frightening. If
you're a smart broadcaster, it's a runaway freight train and it
would be wise to hop aboard.</p><p>Right now that train is hard to see because there isn't a
transmitter supplier pounding on your door, nor a government
regulator with thick books full of stuff you need to care about.
There's just a bunch of freelance hackers and a few companies hip
enough to leverage their good work.</p><p>Then there's the prevailing mindset, which equates MP3 with
WinAmp, the most popular Windows MP3 client. This is why many of
the stations I listed above identify their required client as
&ldquo;<a href="http://www.winamp.com" target="_self">WinAmp</a>&rdquo; and their
format as
&ldquo;<a href="http://www.shoutcast.com" target="_self">Shoutcast</a>&rdquo;.</p><p>Even Shoutcast describes its streams as &ldquo;WinAmp based&rdquo;,
though the company makes Linux-based servers, and there are plenty
of other players that handle MP3 streams.</p><p>There's another anomaly. Even though public radio stations
(NPR and PRI) were among the first to use the Web, very few have
taken advantage of the <a href="http://www.icecast.org" target="_self">low cost
of transmitting</a> MP3 streams and the high variety of
available free clients. The only reliable stream I've found is
<a href="http://152.2.63.108:8000/listen.pls" target="_self">this one</a>
from WUNC. Most other public stations (that bother to stream at
all) use RealAudio. One broadcast engineer told me the main reason
is that Real's codecs are better than MP3 at the slower bit rates
used by most stations. But that's a minor consideration. Most
stations don't yet know there's another way. They're not out here
in the unReal world where the listeners are rolling their
own.</p><p>It's easy to dismiss
<a href="http://www.real.com" target="_self">Real</a> as a dead horse on
this issue, since the company has been highly user-hostile since it
went into business. They spent years burying access to their free
client, obsoleting their clients, promoting and cross-promoting all
kinds of stuff users didn't care about and making lousy clients for
non-Windows platforms.</p><p>But somebody inside the company recently told me the Force is
stronger there than one might think. He writes, &ldquo;we could have had
a really good Linux player years ago. We had an absolutely
brilliant developer working on it, but he quit after exceeding his
pain threshold. Those of us who work here have players that work
better than anything we have released. This place has Linux at its
core despite having a WinTel face.&rdquo; He also says there are signs
internally that the company is turning in a positive
direction.</p><p>So here's a fantasy: Real.com open-sources its codecs,
embraces MP3 and then leapfrogs everybody with a big one&mdash;embracing
<a href="http://www.vorbis.com/index.psp" target="_self">Ogg Vorbis</a>,
which lacks MP3 intellectual property
<a href="http://www.forbes.com/2000/09/18/dvorak_index.html" target="_self">legacy</a>.
And then it helps shepherd its partners in the entertainment
business from where they are now to the New Reality.</p><p>If they don't, the blood on the tracks will be their own. The
train has left the station.</p></div></div>
