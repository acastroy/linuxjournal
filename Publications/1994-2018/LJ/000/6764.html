build the Ultimate Linux Box. This time we're going to do things a
bit differently: I'm going to analyze one element at a time, write
a web article on it, take readers' feedback from that, add the next
component and so on, until we've built the entire box together. A
little open-source project, if you will.</p><p>This year the idea is to build a multimedia workstation. We
want a dual-head video card, professional quality USB sound, the
latest in serial ATA RAID storage, a DVD recorder, some serious
horsepower to drive it all and, of course, a nice case.</p><p>So, let's get down to cases. For this sort of project we want
a case that can hold as many ATA drives as possible, for future
expansion, but that is still something approaching a normal size.
It also should have good cooling, because all that hardware will
tend to get rather warm. I looked at three different mid-tower
cases: the Chenming ATX-601AW, the Thermaltake Xaser III V1000A and
the Lian Li PC-65B.</p><p><a href="http://www.chenming.com/601AEspec.htm" target="_self">The
Chenming</a> is a rakish looking thing, available in several
different colors of anodized aluminum. It has four 80mm fans&mdash;two
in the front and two in the back&mdash;four 5.25" bays and six 3.5"
bays, the lower four positions being internal-only. The external
bays are concealed by a hinged plastic cover. The side panel is
unique in that it is not held into position with thumb screws;
instead, it locks into place with a key. (I'm not sure this is an
advantage for tinkerers who are apt to lose their keys.) The fixed
motherboard tray accommodates the extended-ATX-size motherboards
(12 x 13), although the largish bar across the open end of the case
(an artifact of its being all-aluminum) is going to make getting
the motherboard in and out rather interesting. On the other hand,
getting 5.25" devices in and out is a breeze. No having to pop the
front bezel; simply unplug from the back, then unclip and pull. No
problem. Street price: $85.99.</p><p><a href="http://www.thermaltake.com/products/xaser3/v1000a.htm" target="_self">The
Thermaltake</a> is the giant of the group, nearly 21" tall. It
sports, among its other accents, a blue Thermaltake logo that
lights up when the machine is powered on. Both the front and side
covers lock, which is good for the security-conscious. The front
panel has a built-in Hardcano 7 display, which has a Firewire port,
two USB sockets, a temperature readout and a fan speed control for
the seven fans. As for fans, there are two each in the front, side
and rear, a seventh one in the top. Twelve drive bays lurk under
the cover, with the usual four-and-two accessible from outside.
This cavern of a case takes the E-ATX motherboards with room to
spare. It's almost completely tool-less inside, from the drive bays
to the PC card holders. The drive and card holders are plastic,
however; having shipped a lot of Linux machines in a previous
incarnation, I'm a little dubious as to how well that would stand
up under shipping. It lists for $169.99.</p><p>Then, we come to the
<a href="http://www.lian-li.com/product.php?action=viewPD&amp;prdid=708" target="_self">Lian
Li</a>. A sleek all-black affair with a hard-anodized finish,
this case appeals to the tinkerer in me. Undo a few thumb screws in
the back, and the entire motherboard tray (standard-ATX sized)
slides out. All the innards come loose with metal thumb screws,
even the PC cards. The usual case wiring is on a ribbon cable with
a quick disconnect, making major surgery on the machine a breeze.
There are four fans, two up front, one in the rear and one in the
top. The drive mounts are unique; there are the usual four 5.25"
bays, but all three of the upper 3.5" mounts are accessible from
outside. The lower five are mounted sideways across the bottom of
the case, directly in front of the twin fans. The pop-off front
bezel conceals the fan speed control, and it has a nice metal door
covering the USB ports. (The bezel is the one major part of this
case that does <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> involve thumb screws.)
There aren't any locks on the case, although there is a bracket in
the back into which you could insert a small padlock and keep folks
out. $124.99 takes it home.</p><p>So we have three nice cases&mdash;but which one really deserves to
be the foundation of the Ultimate Linux Box? The Chenming quickly
can be eliminated from contention; it's missing two drive bays and
a top fan in comparison to the other two cases. The decision
between the other two cases, thought, isn't quite as easy. Seven
fans and the front panel display are awfully alluring advantages
for the Thermaltake. However, the slide-out motherboard tray is an
effective counter to a hardware geek, and metal thumb screws trump
plastic latches. Besides, one is likely to spend more time either
inside the case or looking at the screen; a snarky-looking case
gets you points at a LAN party, but it doesn't do anything for you
when you're trying to get work done. The final factor that puts the
Lian Li over the top is it's all-aluminum construction, which
dissipates heat better than the Thermaltake's steel chassis. (The
Lian Li is the only all-aluminum case that I have seen that really
seems as sturdy as a steel case, the Chenming included, and the
price tag reflects it.) The one downside to the Lian Li is it is
limited to a standard ATX motherboard; the big monsters won't fit.
But, not to worry&mdash;there are ways of putting quite a bit of
horsepower into a 17" case. But that's a topic for next
time.</p><p>Next installment: the Chairman of the Board.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Glenn Stone</b></span> is a Red Hat
