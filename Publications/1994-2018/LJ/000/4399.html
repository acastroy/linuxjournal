    Apple Computer, the very antithesis of the Open Source movement, and considered evil by the GNU project due to their closed technology practices, is known the world over for killing as many third-party companies as it created (and killing them for no reason other than they dared to make money from Apple's technology). And then there's Steve Jobs.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2193580.0x228b138"></a></h2></div></div><p>Could we possibly find an individual more
unlike Linus Torvalds? We are told Jobs is ill-tempered, mean,
merciless, unconscionable and abusive to those that work with and
for him. We are told to trust him at our own peril. And, we are
told he possesses an ego that's roughly the size of China. So, why,
in heavens name, would we <span   class="emphasis"><em>ever</em></span> want to cover
new technology from Apple Computer?
</p><p>The reason is simple enough: it's always a good idea to keep
an eye on the competition. And don't be fooled into thinking the
only competition Linux faces lives in Redmond. Of course, Apple
Computer has always been worth watching. As a company, Apple is the
sole survivor of the pre-IBM PC era, it knows more about desktop
computing and ease-of-use than most, and it has (with all due
respect to the good folk at GNOME and KDE) always produced the
best, and most usable, GUI.</p><p>Apple's newest OS offering is called Mac OS X. The very name
hints at its two major components. Mac OS X is the Macintosh
interface built on top of a UNIX base. It has as its base a
technology called &ldquo;Darwin&rdquo;, which is an open-source implementation
based on the Mach micro-kernel. Yes, your eyes aren't playing
tricks with you&mdash;Apple has open sourced a core software technology.
What is especially interesting is that the Darwin open-source
development team is readying a version of the kernel for Intel chip
technology; this alone should start some Linux alarm bells
ringing). The currently available implementation, officially
bundled as &ldquo;Mac OS X Public Beta&rdquo;, targets the PowerPC
microprocessor.</p><p>Before I get into details, it's time for a confession, it's
time to come clean. <span   class="emphasis"><em>I'm a huge fan of the
Macintosh</em></span>, and have been ever since my wife bought me a
Mac Color Classic back in 1993. As with most part-time, at-home Mac
users, work is a different story, and I've always been &ldquo;required&rdquo;
to use the Wintel platform in the office. Only recently have I
managed to arrange things so that the box under my desk sports a
rainbow colored fruit logo (together with the words &ldquo;G3 Server&rdquo;).
It breaks my heart to say it, but the Mac Color Classic now lives
with my brother-in-law, and in its place sits a no-name Wintel PC.
Among other things (and for my sins), I'm writing and maintaining a
Windows-based suite of applications using Borland's Delphi
technology, so Windows 98 has to stay around to support that
activity. To support my other activities (teaching, research, and
writing), I partitioned Wintel's disk drive and installed Linux
Mandrake.</p><p>I spend most of my Linux time working with Perl,
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> and LaTeX. I got into Linux
about 18 months ago, after picking up the April 1999 issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i> at a local newsagents. My
previous experience of UNIX was using it at University in the late
80's. (I avoid Windows NT like the plague.)</p><p>Until quite recently, and in combination with Mac OS 9, I ran
the LinuxPPC distribution in the office. As I use all these
different environments to accomplish different things, I'm
constantly rebooting both my home and office PCs, jumping in and
out of Linux, Mac OS 9 and Windows 98. For a while I ran the
Mac-On-Linux technology on top of LinuxPPC, and this gave me access
to my Mac applications from within Linux. Although Mac-On-Linux is
impressive technology, it is a little too flaky for me to use on a
regular basis, so I stopped using it. However, it is on my list of
technologies to revisit at some later date.</p><p>Now you know where I'm coming from, and I can get back to Mac
OS X. Apple Computer announced the beta release of Mac OS X Public
Beta in the fall of 2000 and offer the technology to the Macintosh
community for $29.95. Members of their developers programmes
received a copy of the OS for free, together with a CD of developer
tools. This is how I acquired my copy, as I doubt I would have been
willing to pay for the privilege of beta testing Apple's latest OS
creation. I don't mind paying for a full release product (like a
Linux distribution), but charging for a beta product...come on,
Apple! So it costs to produce and ship all those CD's; but surely
it doesn't take much to make Mac OS X available for free
download?</p><p>Before I could even get to the install, a small shock was
waiting for me. The README documentation on the CD informed me that
Mac OS X needed 128 MB of RAM to install! I nearly fell off my
seat. I can only hope that this is due to the fact that Mac OS X is
beta software and that a lot of debug code is shipping with this
particular build. My office Mac is not that old, but it had only a
single 64 MB DRAM chip installed. Luckily, a friendly computer
technician on campus allowed me to swap my single 64 MB for 128.
With the swap completed, I was all ready to go.</p><p>As would be expected, the installation on my G3 went
smoothly&mdash;after all, Apple supply both the hardware
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> the software. Very little configuration
information or knowledge is expected from the user. I was required
to graphically select the disk partition upon which to install Mac
OS X (which I had already preconfigured with Apple's SCSI HD Setup
utility). I then provided my Internet details when prompted, as
well as a default login-ID and password. Everything else was taken
care of. It was during the installation that I got the first hint
that this was something new. For starters, one of the components
being installed was described as the &ldquo;BSD Subsystem&rdquo;. This may not
mean much to the regular Macintosh user, but I had a fair idea of
what was going on.</p><p>Once installed, a quick reboot brought up the Mac OS X login
screen. I logged in and, after a few seconds, was greeted by the
Mac OS X desktop. Apple is calling this new interface technology
&ldquo;Aqua&rdquo;, and it is quite stunning to look at (see the
screenshot).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4399f1.large.jpg"><img src="4399f1.jpg"></a></div><p>It is not until you have used Aqua for a while and explored
its many features that you realize just what an exceptional piece
of software engineering it actually is. Of course, Aqua is not the
X Window System, it is proprietary Apple technology, and
proprietary Apple code. From a Mac users perspective, Aqua is very
much like the Mac OS desktop they are used to, but a few
differences make it feel a bit strange. Certainly, logging into a
Mac will be a new experience for most longtime Mac folk. The other
major shock is that the Mac now has a command line! The
<span   class="bold"><b>Terminal</b></span> utility lets you access a
<b  >/bin/tcsh</b> shell to work with&mdash;as stated in the
Mac OS X on-line help system, &ldquo;BSD Utility programs&rdquo;. This was my
first port-of-call, because every time I come across a new system I
check for my essential list of tools, Perl, vi, LaTeX and
<span   class="bold"><b>ispell</b></span>.</p><p>Typing <b  >perl -v</b> at the command line
produced the Perl 5.6.0 copyright notice. Cool. The vi editor is
always there, but I checked anyway, and sure enough, Mac OS X has
vi installed. Typing <b  >latex</b> and
<b  >ispell</b> at the command line produced &ldquo;Command not
found&rdquo; error messages. Bummer.</p><p>A quick visit to
<a href="http://www.tug.org" target="_self">www.tug.org</a> soon
directed me to the teTeX site, and I was able to download a
precompiled binary of TeX and LaTeX for Mac OS X. A visit to
<a href="http://www.gnu.org" target="_self">www.gnu.org</a> netted
me a copy of <b  >ispell</b> which, after two days of
trying all I know, still has yet to build from source. I even went
as far as downloading and installing the GNU text utilities in
order to have a more compatible <b  >sort</b> utility on
hand, but that didn't help me get the install completed. A defeated
man, I eventually gave up, and made a mental note to return to it
at some future date.</p><p>Of course, ease of installation is only part of the
ease-of-use equation (and all the Linux distributions&mdash;except
perhaps Rock Linux&mdash;have been making great strides in this area).
Another area to consider is ease-of-administration. To illustrate,
I'll recount a recent experience.</p><p>At work, one of my courses involves teaching computer
networking to second-year undergraduate students. During the
course, I expose my students (sometimes for the first time) to
Linux, vi, Perl and all the usual Internet development technologies
(HTML, CGI, JavaScript, etc.). In past years, and to support my
practical sessions, my students have logged into one of my
Institute's central Linux servers. Unfortunately, I could never be
sure that the system would be configured exactly as I liked, so
this year I thought I would set up accounts on my LinuxPPC system
and let the students log into my office system. Setting up multiple
users was easy enough; I just used the <b  >adduser</b>
and <b  >passwd</b> commands to create the 15 accounts.
(I know, I could have used the friendlier Users Control Panel from
within GNOME, but I was already at the command line). I then
switched on Telnet via the <b  >/etc/inetd.conf</b> file.
All easy and straightforward so far, and it worked.</p><p>Now that my students had access to my machine, I thought it
would be nice to let them create some personal HTML pages on the
system. Specifically, I wanted to let anyone access these pages
using the <b  >/~username</b> URL syntax, where
&ldquo;username&rdquo; is the name of a user on the system (and which would be
resolved to that users home directory by Apache). Not knowing how
to do this, I reached for my trusty copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running
Linux, 3rd Edition</em></span> and read through the section on
setting up and configuring Apache.</p><p>I found out a bit about Apache, including what I thought was
all I needed to know, information on the <b  >UserDir</b>
directive, as well as some material on the
<b  >srm.conf</b>, <b  >httpd.conf</b> and
<b  >access.conf</b> configuration files. After changing
what I thought had to be change, I restarted Apache with the new
settings enabled. I then surfed to my machine and tried to access a
newly created, personal web page, but I got a permissions error. I
reread the pages on Apache, fiddled with a few more settings and
got the permission error again.</p><p>My usual strategy for dealing with things like this is to go
away and do something else for a while, think about the problem,
then come back and have another go. Unfortunately, this time, my
usual strategy didn't work. I was still getting a permissions
error, so I thought that the problem might be with the user under
which Apache was running (it was set to <b  >nobody</b>
in one of the configuration files). I fiddled with this to try and
see if it would work under a different user, but it didn't. I
fiddled with my systems group settings, and that didn't work
either.</p><p>A former workmate of mine refers to this mode of work
practice as &ldquo;guess and jiggle&rdquo;. At this stage, I was done guessing
and I was done jiggling. The basic problem was, like most newcomers
to Linux, I knew just enough to be dangerous, so I got frightened
and decided that any more guessing and jiggling might compromise my
system. I reset everything as best I could and left it alone. It
bugged me, though, that I couldn't make it work the way I wanted. I
also wasn't sure if it was my fault, the fault of Apache or the
fault of LinuxPPC.</p><p>Then, as if by magic, the Mac OS X mailshot appeared on my
desk. Having installed it in about ten minutes (rather ruthlessly
on top of my old LinuxPPC partition), I recreated the 15 student
accounts using the graphical &ldquo;Multiple Hosts&rdquo; utility. The
<b  >adduser</b> command could not be found on the Mac OS
X command line. I then turned on Apache (which installed with the
OS) by clicking a check-box in the &ldquo;Network Services&rdquo; control
panel. I searched for the Apache configuration files using the
Sherlock graphical search tool and, once found, determined that
Apache was looking in the <b  >public_html</b> directory
for personal web pages. I created the directory under my own
account login, then created a five-line HTML page. Surfing from
another machine, I accessed the web server running on my Mac OS X
computer and asked it to display <b  >/~barryp</b>
and...up came my five-line web page, followed shortly thereafter by
a triumphant &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; on my part! <span   class="emphasis"><em>It worked the way I
wanted it to by default</em></span>. After all, if you have multiple
users on a system, and you are running Apache on that same system,
doesn't it makes sense that your users might want to publish their
own web pages? I know which of the two setups I think is easier to
use...</p><p>Of course, shortly after I made the move to Mac OS X, I came
across an article discussing the configuration of Apache using the
<span   class="bold"><b>Comanche</b></span> utility, which may have
helped my LinuxPPC woes. Then again, it may not have. I also
received issue 78 of <i  >LJ</i>, which included an
excellent article on Apache, about one week too late to help me
with my LinuxPPC problems (by then I'd already moved to Mac OS
X).</p><p>Under the hood, Mac OS X is running a kernel based on Mach
3.0 from Carnegie-Mellon University and FreeBSD 3.2 (which is,
itself, derived from BSD 4.4-Lite). What's not mentioned is that
this is Apple's first OS offering to incorporate technology
inherited directly from the NeXT Computer buyout.</p><p>Mac OS X is a much different beast than Linux. Whereas Linux
is a monolithic kernel with everything but the kitchen sink running
in kernel mode, Mach is microkernel based, in that it restricts
what processes can run in the kernel to a small subset. Most
everything else runs in user mode. Rather that spark off another
Tanenbaum/Torvalds debate on which design is the way to go, let's
just leave it that both are valid design architectures for an OS,
both have their pluses and minuses and both work. The big technical
difference from previous editions of Mac OS is that the base OS is
now truly preemptive as opposed to being cooperative, when it
multitasks. This is directly attributable to the use of the Mach
micro-kernel. Support for POSIX, NFS and BSD TCP/IP networking also
come as standard.</p><p>Standard Aqua applications include Apple's own e-mail
program, a bunch of QuickTime applications, the usual utilities
and&mdash;wait for it&mdash;Microsoft's Internet Explorer 5 (IE5). IE5 for
Mac OS X is buggy and slow, and I hate it. Luckily, support for
&ldquo;legacy&rdquo; Macintosh applications (called &ldquo;Classic&rdquo; applications
within Mac OS X) comes as standard, and it works somewhat like
Mac-On-Linux except that the legacy applications run on the Aqua
desktop, as opposed to within a separate Aqua window. This
technology works well, and I as able to use Netscape Communicator,
ClarisWorks and all of my usual Mac OS 9 applications without any
real problems.</p><p>Of course, not all was plain sailing. I've had two crashes in
as many weeks; nothing but a flick of the power switch would bring
me back on-line. As this is &ldquo;beta&rdquo; software, I am willing to accept
this, for now. In Apple's favor, they do warn about using the beta
Mac OS X in production environments. A major annoyance is the fact
that Mac OS X appears to know nothing about floppy disks. When I
slid a floppy into the slot at the front of my G3, nothing
happened. I was expecting, as will every other Mac user on the
planet, to see a graphical image of my floppy appear on the Mac OS
X desktop. Nothing. I searched Help for the word &ldquo;floppy&rdquo; and found
nothing. Even more annoying was the treatment of my ZIP disks. A
Mac OS formatted ZIP appeared on the desktop when inserted into the
G3's ZIP drive, but when I slid in a PC formatted ZIP disk, Mac OS
X did nothing. This worked really nicely under the old system, and
should be part of Mac OS X. I'm praying Apple fixes it before the
next release.</p><p>As for Steve Jobs, well, he has always been out to change the
world. With Mac OS X, his beloved Apple Computer has another chance
to do just that. Apple changed the world as we knew it when it
released the Apple II in the second half of the 70's, and then they
did it again in 1984 with the introduction of the original
Macintosh. Since then things have been quiet in Cupertino; granted,
technologies such as the PowerBook, iMac and iBook are cool, but
they are really just incremental improvements over the original
1984 Mac. Mac OS X has the potential to be a much bigger deal than
any other OS Apple has produced in the past, but the company must
move quickly. Specifically, Apple should open source the Aqua code
and publicly support the porting of its technologies to the Linux
kernel. Coupled together, Linux and Aqua would make an unbeatable
pairing on the Intel platform. World domination, indeed. Just
imagine the panic in Redmond.</p><p>So, does Mac OS X mean the end of LinuxPPC on my office
computer? For now, my problems with <b  >ispell</b> not
withstanding, the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. Mac OS X gives me all I need in
the office; it's a Mac and it's UNIX/Linux, too. I'm in heaven. At
home, I'm stuck with my Windows/Mandrake combo for now, but at
least I can boot into Mandrake when my frustration meter for
Windows 98 peaks. And, all the tools I use on Mandrake are, as they
were with LinuxPPC, 100% compatible with those I now use on Mac OS
X. Of course, the ability to avoid all those reboots in the office
is a major plus for me.</p><p>I've been running Mac OS X for a few weeks now, and I'll keep
running it in the office until May 2001 when my beta license
expires. Let's hope Apple issue the full 1.0 release before then
and that Apple gives it away for free to all comers, developers and
users alike.</p><p>Paul Barry (paul.barry@itcarlow.ie) lectures in computer
