number of exciting announcements, events, exhibits and keynotes.
Kicking off LinuxWorld yesterday at 9:50 AM, Linus Torvalds
addressed the multitude of suits, hackers, press and other
interested parties. As per his usual opening statement, he began by
saying, &ldquo;I don't like talks. I am a programmer.&rdquo; In an attempt to
not give a &ldquo;talk&rdquo;, Linus addressed some questions he is frequently
asked.</p><p>Dressed in a black dress shirt (sans tie) and black dress
pants (sans sandals), he spoke for thirty minutes before answering
questions from the audience. The non-talk was complete with slides,
perceived problems facing the future growth of Linux (namely,
fragmentation), quick jabs at Microsoft, and the latest
developments from the 2.4 kernel. Linus was his usual relaxed self.
He was often funny, and at times self-effacing, wanting everyone to
know he is just a programmer and not the &ldquo;poster boy&rdquo; for
open-source software, deferring that title to RMS. Linus truly has
become a rather polished speaker, no doubt due to his distaste for
speaking (and the amount he is &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to speak).</p><p>I wouldn't say the keynote was devoid of new information, but
most of what Linus had to say was somewhat canned. And, the more
interesting and more important action was taking place elsewhere.
To me, the most interesting part of LinuxWorld is always the people
in attendance and the enthusiasm of the community as a whole. Linus
is a big draw, but hardly a source of much news. The news comes
from the tradeshow floor.</p><p>My days here are filled with interviewing various vendors
selling various products, and talking with any representative from
any company wanting to make an announcement. Being on the tradeshow
floor offers insight into &ldquo;what people are talking about&rdquo;. And the
word is: Embedded! The biggest announcements from yesterday
involved <a href="http://www.lineo.com" target="_self">Lineo's</a>
acquisition of
<a href="http://www.realtimelinux.com" target="_self">Zentropic</a>, a
company firmly entrenched in the world of real-time applications.
<a href="http://www.redhat.com" target="_self">Red Hat</a> recently
unveiled its embedded plans, and everyone from Lynx to Linus has
been talking about the &ldquo;Linux Fridge&rdquo;. It seems that a group of
engineers and programmers at Fujitsu created a smart fridge using
Linux, complete with a web browser built into the door. At some
point, I imagine, you will be able to link up to Homegrocer.com
(through your fridge browser) and automatically have certain items
&ldquo;magically&rdquo; appear at your doorstep. You may not realize the milk
is gone, but your fridge will! Linus speculated, in his keynote,
that the point might be to keep people from eating more, seeing
that their time is occupied with using the browser. Quite
possible.</p><p>Dr. Inder Singh, Chairman of Lynx Real Time Systems, Inc.,
spoke with me about a BMW that has some 30 processors! Service
technicians can be contacted from your car, by your car, and the
appropriate action can be taken&mdash;and fast. Embedded system
development is certainly one of the more flashy and exciting areas,
but the investors and suits usually make the biggest
announcements.</p><p>Acquisitions, partnerships and mergers spread from booth to
booth and throughout the press. Red Hat struck again, closing a
&ldquo;technical partnership&rdquo; with Alpha Processor, Inc. (API), which
specializes in high-performance clustering. Red Hat plans to house
a world-class Linux clustering lab.</p><p><a href="http://www.valinux.com" target="_self">VA Linux Systems</a>
bought <a href="http://andover.net" target="_self">Andover.net</a>, which
is already the highlight of today, and likely to be the most
talked-about merger of the show. Details are still being released;
in fact, VA Linux President Larry Augustin is soon to begin his
keynote address. The deal is upwards of $900 million, and sets VA
Linux on a path toward Linux news dominance&mdash;<i  >Linux Journal</i> excluded!</p><p>On a lighter note,
<a href="http://www.linuxcare.com" target="_self">Linuxcare</a> threw a
party for attendees last night at the Javits Center. There were
free video games, drinks, music, pool tables, air hockey and a few
basketball hoops. I represented <i  >Linux Journal</i>
long enough to drink my two free beers before leaving to explore
something unrelated to Linux. Spending the entire day at the Javits
was enough, and seeing geeks chucking basketballs off the wall was
more than I could bear.</p><p>I ran into a few of the
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org" target="_self">FreeBSD</a> girls, who
easily took the award for tackiest and most sexist booth presence.
The hired booth help wore <span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> tight red devil
suits, complete with tails and horns. Nothing wrong with having a
little fun, but you wouldn't catch a classy OS like Linux slipping
to such a low level.</p><p>Eric Raymond (and me without my 3D glasses ... if you don't
get this, check out the print version of the January
<i  >Linux Journal</i>) stopped by the
<i  >LJ</i> booth to chat and check out the inflatable
penguin chairs, which we had been giving away regularly. The User
Friendly group has a dust puppy cruising around. The SuSE lizard
(or whatever it is) is in the house, and looks even more strange in
person. There is a FreeBSD devil (male version) and various
penguins roaming the floor. All and all, a good start to a very
exciting show. Today is a new day, and has already started with big
news. More soon...</p></div></div>
