    The basic OpenOffice applications have built-in HTML functions;
    here's how to find and use them.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2039580.0x2131240"></a></h2></div></div><p>OpenOffice.org is an office suite based
on Star Office and released as open source. The suite contains
standard office applications, such as a word processor and programs
for spreadsheets, drawings and presentations. All of these
applications can be used to create web pages, and this article will
introduce their HTML capabilities.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2039580.0x2131348"></a>Writer</h2></div></div><p>Perhaps the most common application used to create web pages
is OpenOffice.org's word processor, Writer. Writer's HTML
capabilities include saving existing documents as HTML, creating
new documents as HTML and creating several different types of web
pages using a wizard.</p><p>The easiest way to create HTML documents is to start with an
existing Writer document. You can view it as it will appear on a
web page by selecting Online Layout from the View menu or by
clicking on its toolbar button.</p><p>Links can be inserted and modified using the hyperlink
editor. Display the editor by clicking on its toolbar button or
clicking Hyperlink on the Insert menu. From the Hyperlink window
(see Figure 1), you can choose the type of link, as well as specify
the link's address, text and how it should be displayed (e.g., in a
new window). To edit an existing link or turn existing text into a
link, simply highlight it before opening the Hyperlink window. You
have to click Apply to insert the link into your document before
closing the window.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6289f1.large.jpg"><img src="6289f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Hyperlink Window</p></div></div>
</p><p>If you are satisfied with how your document looks in the
Online Layout, select Save As from the File menu and specify Web
Page as the file type. I saved several files as HTML, including
ones with tables, and Writer did a pretty good job with them. One
thing that Writer didn't do properly was replace multiple spaces in
the original document with the HTML code for non-breaking
spaces.</p><p>If you have a large document, Writer can save it as a series
of HTML files with a table of contents page. To do this, decide
which headings in the document should be on separate pages and make
sure that they have the same formatting style (e.g., Heading 2).
Then select Send on the File menu and click on Create HTML
Document. A dialog box will appear allowing you to specify the file
name to save the pages under and which style indicates a new page.
Click Save to create your multipage HTML document. According to the
DOCTYPE tag inserted by OpenOffice.org, the resulting HTML files
conform to the HTML 3.2 standard.</p><p>In addition, you are not limited to dealing with files that
reside on your computer. According to OpenOffice.org's help file,
it is possible to specify a fully qualified URL or FTP address in
the Open dialog and retrieve a document over a network. I have
successfully opened a document using a URL, such as
http://www.netperson.net/~rkrause/index.html, but I haven't been
able to get the process to work with an FTP address.</p><p>When I tried suppling an FTP address a window appeared asking
me for my user name followed by an error window. The OpenOffice.org
Bugzilla database lists problems with transferring documents using
FTP (IDs 3726, 3728), but there is no clear indication it has been
fixed. There is also an unanswered letter in the User's forum
addressing a problem transferring files with FTP.</p><p>OpenOffice.org's wizard, called AutoPilot, allows you to
create several types of standard web pages. To use the AutoPilot,
click AutoPilot and then Web Page... in the File menu.</p><p>A window will open (Figure 2) allowing you to select a
template and layout to use. Templates define the structure of the
web page, while layouts determine font styles, colors and page
background. Some templates included with OpenOffice.org are A list
with table of contents, Contact Form, Photo Album and Single column
with subheading. The standard template provides a document with a
page heading in large text, example links, space for body text and
a line indicating when the document was last changed.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6289f2.large.jpg"><img src="6289f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Web Page AutoPilot
</p></div></div><p>Changes in the template and layout selections are reflected
in the document immediately so you can preview them. Occasionally
the document doesn't update properly when a new layout is chosen,
but choosing the Empty template and then selecting your original
template takes care of this.</p><p>You can create a template based on your selections by placing
a check in the Create template box. You then can use this template
in the future by selecting Templates and Documents under New from
the File menu.</p><p>Clicking the Create button closes the window and allows you
to edit the document. If you elected to create a template, the
Templates window will appear where you name your template.</p><p>Although Writer does a decent job of converting documents
into HTML, there are times when you might have to tweak the code by
hand. You edit the document's underlying HTML code by clicking on
HTML Source on the toolbar or the View menu.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2039580.0x2131c38"></a>Calc</h2></div></div><p>The OpenOffice.org spreadsheet, Calc, also can save its files
as HTML documents. If the file contains more than one sheet, the
additional sheets will follow one another in the HTML file. Links
to each sheet will be placed at the top of the document. Calc also
allows you to insert links directly into your spreadsheet via the
Hyperlink dialog.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2039580.0x2131d40"></a>Draw</h2></div></div><p>The drawing program allows you to turn your drawings into a
series of web pages. These web pages are created by using the
Export command from the File menu. Select Web Page as the file
type, supply a name for the resulting HTML file and click Save. The
HTML Export window will open (Figure 3) allowing you to select
whether to use an existing design for your web pages or create a
new one.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6289f5.large.jpg"><img src="6289f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>HTML Export Window</p></div></div>
</p><p>Clicking Next allows you to select the type of web pages to
create. The types available are Standard HTML format, Standard HTML
with frames, Automatic and WebCast. You also tell OpenOffice.org to
create a title page for your presentation if you want one.</p><p>Picking Standard HTML generate a series of pages, each page
containing one slide. Navigation links are available to move from
slide to slide. Selecting Automatic for the publication type
generates a series of pages, each with the Refresh meta tag set
that causes a browser to automatically cycle through each web page.
The final option, WebCast, generates an ASP or Perl application to
display your slides. After selecting the type of publication to
create, select whether to convert the slides to GIF or JPG files
and what resolution should be used.</p><p>If you elected to create a title page in the second step
above, you supply the information for it on the next page. The
title contains an author name, e-mail address and home page, along
with any additional information you wish to display.</p><p>The next page of the HTML Export wizard allows you to choose
between text or graphics for the links used to navigate through the
slides. If you opt to use graphical navigation buttons, you can
select from several styles to use.</p><p>Next you can select the color scheme to use for the web
pages. Available schemes include the document's existing scheme,
one based upon browser colors or a completely user-defined
scheme.</p><p>Clicking the Create button generates the HTML files required
for your type of publication. The HTML and image files are placed
in the same directory, so you might want to create unique
directories for each drawing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2039580.0x2132268"></a>Impress</h2></div></div><p>Exporting presentations from OpenOffice.org's Impress
application is similar to exporting a drawing from Draw. You use
the Export command from the File menu and select Web Page as the
file type. The only difference is that you are offered the option
to display each slide's notes along with the slide.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2039580.0x2132370"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>OpenOffice.org contains many features to create and edit web
pages. Although these applications may not meet the needs of
high-level site designers, they offer other users the ability to
create decent web pages.</p><p>After using the OpenOffice.org applications to edit your web
pages, you will have to use other applications to update and
maintain your site. OpenOffice.org offers the ability to load web
pages by supplying a URL, but I was unable to transfer files over
FTP.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2039580.0x21324d0"></a>Resources</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://www.openoffice.org" target="_self">OpenOffice.org</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Ralph Krause</b></span> is a writer,
