    Now is the time to see how well the feature-frozen kernel
    works on your hardware, with your load.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2730580.0x2828240"></a></h2></div></div><p>A lot of people ask me, &ldquo;When do you
think the 2.6 kernel will be released?&rdquo; My response to that
question usually is, &ldquo;Well, how well is the 2.5 kernel working for
you?&rdquo; Inevitably, during the resulting conversation where I plead
with the person to please at least run the kernel once on their
hardware, they respond with one of the following reasons why they
have not tried 2.5:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Too many drivers are broken.</p></li><li><p>Modules are broken.</p></li><li><p>Alan Cox says it's not ready.</p></li><li><p>It might eat my filesystem.</p></li></ul></div><p>Here are my responses to these reasons:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>&ldquo;Too many drivers are broken.&rdquo;
</p><p>The reason why a reasonably large number of drivers do not
even compile in the kernel tree today is no one has proven the
driver is even needed. Usually drivers are broken due to API
changes during the development cycle, when it is not a trivial
change to fix. Examples of this problem were the large number of
block layer changes and the removal of the cli() function.</p><p>The only way these drivers will ever get fixed is if people
say they need them fixed, as they are still using that kind of
hardware. If you run across such a driver and you have the
hardware, post to the mailing lists that you really want this
driver fixed and that you are willing to test any changes people
make. The kernel-janitors' mailing list is a very good place to ask
this, as a lot of people there are looking for small tasks like
this to accomplish.</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Modules are broken.&rdquo;
</p><p>Modules have been working for quite a while now. Make sure
you get the latest version of the
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty/modules" target="_self">module-init-tools
package</a>. If you are use an RPM-based distribution, get the
.src.rpm file in that directory, rebuild it and install it. This
file preserves backwards compatibility with 2.4. Debian users can
<b  >apt-get module-init-tools</b>, and all others can
use the module-init-tools source tarball in that directory. (Make
sure you read the documentation on how to install it
properly.)</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Alan Cox says it's not ready.&rdquo;
</p><p>In
<a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=104221680826019" target="_self">this
message</a>, Alan Cox stated that a number of things were still
wrong with the 2.5 kernel, things that needed to be fixed before it
could be called 2.6.0-test. His complaints about the IDE and tty
layers have basically been addressed since then. (He has been
pushing the 2.4 IDE changes to Linus, and the tty layer has had a
number of locking problems fixed.) The major objections of people
wanting to use the 2.5 kernel are gone. His other points about
drivers building and things generally working are going to be
addressed only by being tested by a large number of people, running
the kernel on a wide range of machines. So what are you waiting
for?</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;It might eat my filesystem.&rdquo;
</p><p>Sure, any kernel might do this; make sure you have backed up
any data you really cannot live without. But this is true for any
kernel release or operating system. Now, I don't recommend using
the 2.5 kernel in a production environment yet. Others are already,
read the
<a href="http://www.osdl.org/newsletters/newsletter_2003_mar.html" target="_self">latest
newsletter from OSDL</a> about how they are starting to do this
for their datacenter. But, I will state that I run the 2.5 kernel
on all of my machines except for my firewall, and it runs
particularly better on my laptop than did the 2.4 kernel (due to
the better ACPI support and scheduler changes.) I have never had a
data loss due to the 2.5 kernel yet. (Knock on wood.)</p></li></ul></div><p>So, there go all of the arguments. The only way kernel
developers will know that the 2.5 kernel is working well enough to
declare it a stable 2.6 kernel, is for people to actually run it on
their machines. And for that we need you to actually run the
kernel.</p><p>Remember, any bugs you might find can be filed in the
<a href="http://bugzilla.kernel.org" target="_self">new kernel
Bugzilla</a>, where it will be filed to the proper developer.
It's a good alternative if you don't want to wade through the mess
that the Linux-kernel mailing list can become at times.</p><p>Go forth to build and reboot!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span> is
