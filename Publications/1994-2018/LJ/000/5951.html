    In an open letter to Congress, the biggest name in radio ratings
    calls for a five-year moratorium on webcasting royalties.

<a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/feature/2001/04/30/clear_channel" target="_self">Clear
Channel</a>, Viacom or any of the other obvious suspects. It's
<a href="http://www.arbitron.com" target="_self">Arbitron</a>, the company
that produces the ratings &ldquo;book&rdquo; by which commercial radio stations
live and die. No other company knows more about how radio stations
make money than Arbitron because no one, other than the station
owners, gets a bigger hunk of commercial radio's take.</p><p>So naturally Arbitron has an interest in the future of the
internet radio business. That's why the company has come down hard
on the
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright/carp/webcasting_rates.html" target="_self">CARP
report</a> , which proposes fees and other requirements for
internet radio that effectively prohibit the business from ever
establishing itself, an effort made relatively cheap and easy by
<a href="../000/5725.html" target="_self">Linux and other open-source
software</a>.</p><p><a href="http://www.arbitron.com/webcast_ratings/carpletter.htm" target="_self">In
an open letter to Congress</a> (addressed to F. James
Sensenbrenner, Jr., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee),
Arbitron shows how CARP's fees will simply prohibit stations from
broadcasting on the Net:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>If one of the top-rated radio stations in New
York rebroadcast its programming online and had the same audience
on the Internet as it does over the air, that station would pay
approximately $15 million per year in digital rights fees. Thus,
the digital rights fees would be over 25% of what that station
currently derives from selling traditional over-the-air advertising
revenue (approx. $56 million per year). If that online station had
original programming on the Internet (versus a rebroadcast), its
digital rights fees would be approximately $30 million, or over
half of the revenue a top-ranked music station in New York derives
from its over-the-air advertising revenue.
</p><p>Furthermore, the retroactive nature of the fees and the
excessive data and reporting requirements set forth by CARP add
overwhelming start-up and ongoing operational costs.</p></blockquote></div><p>Here's how it concludes:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>...we believe there should not be any digital
rights fees implemented or, at a minimum, there should be a
five-year moratorium on digital rights fees for streaming media. In
addition, the retroactive aspect of the current proposal should be
eliminated. Little would be lost by giving the industry the
breathing room it needs to grow since streaming media has not yet
generated significant revenues and since the streaming of music on
the Internet does not pose a threat to retail music sales.
Furthermore, a moratorium would enable the popular but fledgling
streaming media industry to grow. Most importantly, the public
interest will be better served by assuring the broad distribution
of programming needed to stimulate competition, foster innovation
and promote diversity.</p></blockquote></div><p>The letter is signed by Bill Rose, vice president and general
manager of
<a href="http://www.arbitron.com/webcast_ratings/home.htm" target="_self">Arbitron's
Webcast Services division</a>. It is also featured on the
company's front page, under the headline
<a href="http://www.arbitron.com/newsroom/archive/article3.htm" target="_self">&ldquo;Arbitron
Speaks Out Against Proposed Digital Rights Fees&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>This is a very big deal: there is no other large company with
a deeper claim to objectivity than Arbitron. It will be interesting
to see if Congress listens to reason.</p><p><a href="http://www.politechbot.com/docs/cbdtpa" target="_self">We
