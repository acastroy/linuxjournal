Use and NYLXS (New York Linux Scene), with help from the Free
Software Foundation, took political action at the Department of
Commerce, which was holding its second Digital Rights Management
(DRM) Workshop. New Yorkers for Fair Use spearheaded the effort to
bring public opinion to the meeting in a reasonable and effective
manner. We are happy to announce that all of our goals were met and
even exceeded by this action, without disrupting the normal
activities of the meeting. It was our goal to have a voice and
participate in the democratic process and not to disrupt it
entirely.</p><p>Prior to the meeting in Washington DC, I, as President of
NYLXS and cofounder of NY Fair Use, was attending the Libre
Software Meeting in Bordeaux, France, at the request of the French
Free Software movement. Upon arriving in France, I checked my
e-mail and found a message from Seth Johnson, Secretary of NY Fair
Use. His message outlined the Commerce Department's announcement of
the workshop, including a list of participants, and asked if NY
Fair Use wanted to attend the meeting. The meeting was scheduled to
take place the day after I arrived back in New York, about a week
from then.</p><p>I was reluctant to schedule a trip to Washington DC so soon
after arriving home, but the meeting appeared to be too good of a
target for the NY Fair use agenda to pass up. It would give us an
opportunity to speak face to face with most of our chief opponents,
including the likeable and articulate Jack Valenti of the MPAA, the
RIAA and several industrial leaders, including Microsoft and Intel.
So I told Seth I would go and assigned him the duty of preparing
everyone for the trip.</p><p>Once the decision was made to go ahead with the plan, several
goals were agreed upon by the NY for Fair Use management, including
Seth, cofounder Brett Wynkoop, Jay Sulzberger, our general public
relations manager, and myself. NYLXS also geared into action by
providing network services and funding for the trip. NYLXS members,
as usual, sprang into action in support of the NY Fair Use
activity. In particular, Micheal Richardson, the NYLXS Membership
Chairman and Journal Editor, designed buttons and helped drive
everyone down to Washington. Kevin Mark contributed to the PR
material, Vinnie alerted as much of the press as possible and Joe
Maffia offered technical support. Even with large numbers of NYLXS
on vacation, the organization worked admirably according to its
charter, to support and educate the public about issues that affect
Free Software in business, education and the home.</p><p>The first agenda item was to get us representation on the
panel, specifically by including myself as a panel representative.
Although I was in France and cut off from many of the Washington
connections that have nurtured us over the last few years, NY Fair
Use was petitioning for a place on the panel from the start. We had
Sarah Brown of the EFF in Washington who put Seth Johnson in
contact with Chris Israel inside the Commerce Department. Seth
Johnson also tried to contact Congressman Weiner's office in an
effort to bring some Congressional pressure to the matter. But with
the limited time frame and our chief advocate in Europe, we were
not able to get representation on the board. Ultimately, NY Fair
Use had to fall back on our secondary plan, to participate as
members of the audience.</p><p>Resigned to being limited to audience participation, we now
opened the discussion to a new mailing list created by Seth for the
purposes of organizing this action in Washington. The first order
of business was to produce proper slogans for our goals. One goal
of NYLXS is to change the whole lexicon of the DRM and Copyright
discussion. We feel that certain messages need to be brought to the
public and the press to assure our future success, not only in this
battle over DRM, but also in a wide variety of copyright and fair
use issues that have trickled into the public eye over the last few
years. We decided, after much discussion and after considering many
opinions on the mailing lists, to attempt to drive into the public
lexicon the phrases, &ldquo;DRM is Theft&rdquo; and &ldquo;We are the Stakeholders&rdquo;.
We carefully chose these expressions to counter the rhetoric coming
out of the copyright monopoly content industry, especially the
claim by Senator Hollings that he had assembled all the
&ldquo;stakeholders&rdquo; to write his CBDTPA bill and Jack Valenti's rhetoric
that the simple act of listening to a DVD on a GNU/Linux operating
system is stealing property from the motion picture
industry.</p><p>The next stage of planning fell into the lap of Seth Johnson,
who mobilized NYLXS and NY Fair Use for the practical matters of
making the trip. Fortunately, today NYLXS is a well-oiled machine.
We are quite proud of the volunteer spirit of the organization and
its ability to deliver when called upon. Joe Maffia found us a
minibus for the trip down. Seth Johnson offered use of his credit
cards to get the truck. Michael Richardson volunteered to drive
everyone to DC. Brett Wynkoop oversaw all the system
administrations and coordination duties needed to keep everyone in
touch. Jay Sulzberger wrote up a terrific position paper for the
trip and a media guide. Vinnie contacted nearly every press contact
he could find with information about the trip. Members of every
political background came from every part of the city to make the
trip. NYLXS has become very effective at organizing events. They
are motivated, proactive and competent.</p><p>Meanwhile in France, Richard Stallman and I reviewed the
political strategy for the action over wine. We agreed to a joint
effort of the FSF and NY for Fair Use groups, and we even planned
backup contingencies, including how to hold a protest outside of
the building if we were not allowed into the conference room. One
of the ideas we knocked around was showing up with steaks, as in
meat, to drive home the message that the public are the
stakeholders on copyright monopoly matters. However, time would not
allow us to coordinate the efforts. They are still on the table for
future political actions.</p><p>With Richard and my arrivals home to the States, all the
pieces were in place for a successful run at changing the direction
of the DRM discussion.</p><p>The afternoon I returned to New York, I touched base with
Seth and made certain the arrangements for the van were in place
and that everyone was clear about the time and place we were to
meet. Having picked up the truck, we decided to have one final
planning session. Because we were leaving at 4 in the morning to
get to DC on time for a meeting with the media at 10AM, everyone
assembled rather early in Flatbush. Brett left with his own car
from Park Slope in Brooklyn and we stayed in touch on the road. In
the minibus we had Michael Richardson, Jay Sulzberger, Seth
Johnson, Vinnie, Forrest Mars, Murray, Kevin Marks and myself.
Nearly everyone was dressed in a suit and tie.</p><p>The drive down to Washington went smoothly, and we met with
media guru Eric Hensal at the Corner Bakery in the Press Club
building, a few blocks from the Commerce Department Building. Eric
gave NY Fair Use great media tips on how to be seen by the press,
in addition to a packet with vital press contacts both in the
building and across town.</p><p>Forrest Mars ran our Media Alert through the building, while
Richard Stallman met with us at the bakery with copies of the
flyers. Richard and I had spent most of the night dotting polishing
the press release by phone and e-mail. Vinnie ran off more copies.
Brett and Kevin ran down to the Commerce Department Building to
scout out the conditions. As it turned out, this was critical
because the Department of Commerce was convinced that they could
close the meeting to the public. Brett's charm and rhetoric
convinced the panel that they couldn't close the workshop. By the
time we were ready to actually go to the meeting, the Panel had
rolled out the red carpet for NY Fair Use, giving us an escort up
to the 4th Floor.</p><p>Finally, at about 12:30 PM, Richard, Seth, Kevin and I
marched to the Commerce Department building, with the rest coming
later. I handed out our flyers and met with several friends in the
press and with other organizations aligned with us. We met with
Declan McCullagh from CNet, Robin Gross of the EFF and American
Library Association Representative Miriam Nisbet. We told them all
of our efforts to protect libraries last year with our Save the
Libraries Campaign. People lined up to meet Richard Stallman before
the meeting, and eventually the rest of our group arrived at the
meeting, filling up the room.</p><p>We also had the pleasure of seeing many old friends from the
Press including Seattle reporter Sarah Strickland and Bloomberg
reporter Katherine Reynolds Lewis. As the meeting started, everyone
in our group was wearing the &ldquo;DRM is Theft&rdquo; and &ldquo;We are the
Stakeholders&rdquo; buttons. In fact, we almost ran out.</p><p>It was not the plan of NY Fair Use in any way to disrupt the
workshop panel. Neither was it the goal of the organization to sit
mute in the audience and make our presence felt. Our goal was to
clearly participate as audience members of the panel, within the
bounds of normal political discourse, as is the rule with such
contentious issues. For example, as the meeting started, the Chair
began by saying that he'd like to announce that nobody on the panel
is a villain. This brought audible laughter from the audience. We
were then quiet for the next hour.</p><p>At one point, Brett Wynkoop, who couldn't find a chair and
finally sat near the panel's table, raised his hand when the Chair
asked if anyone else had a comment. The Chair recognized Brett, who
then proceeded to announce his name and position as cofounder of NY
Fair Use. The Chair tried to unrecognize him, but Brett plowed
forward, within the bounds of Rogers Rules of Order, by asking the
panel how they could consider regulations and laws that would turn
every teenager in America with a magic marker or white-out into a
felon. Brett was referring to the recent flap over the attempt by
the music industry to produce DRM for audio CDs, which was quickly
defeated with a single line made by a marker.</p><p>Several minutes of interesting debate followed, which
climaxed when one of the lawyers on the panel gave the legal
opinion that the courts would never convict anyone for using a
magic marker as a circumvention device, because the courts had not
considered that a sufficient circumvention method under the DMCA.
At this point, I asked if we can get that in writing for the next
DMCA trial dealing with digital music. Everyone was jovial at this
point, enjoying the open participatory democratic process unfolding
before their eyes.</p><p>Earlier, a schematic diagram of the current state of DRM
development was presented. This alphabet soup of circles and
letters was discussed for several minutes; the thing looked looked
similar to a network map of the Internet. Nobody could understand a
word of what was being presented, but we sat quietly and listened
anyway. At the end of this part of the representation, the image on
the projector was flipped, to connect the dots in complete chaos.
This fitting image of the state of current DRM schemes would come
back to haunt the panel as the presentation went on.</p><p>NY Fair Use mostly sat quietly through the meeting,
occasionally whispering to each other, until MPAA spokesman Jack
Valenti took the floor. At this point, Jack elegantly said in a
beautiful, self-effacing fashion, that he hopes that everyone on
the panel would give him the courtesy to be heard, and then he
would yield the floor to others. At that moment, Vinnie stood up
and said, &ldquo;How can you expect everyone to present their response to
your comments when you've left off the panel the most important
stakeholders, the public?&rdquo;. Jack then graciously said that if we
let him speak without interruption (not that we seriously
interrupted anyone), he would be glad to listen to Vinnie's reply.
Jay Sulzberger stood up and said we all agreed. The Chair seemed to
be feeling a little uncomfortable at this point, as though he was
losing control of the situation. But everyone sat silently and
heard Jack speak.</p><p>He put on a classic Jack Valenti performance, saying that it
was his position that government intervention in this matter wasn't
a bad thing. He said his experience in the Johnson Administration
passing the 1965 Civil Rights Act showed him how important and good
proper government intervention can be. He then continued by saying
that it was his hope that the leaders of the IT industry and the
computer field would come to a consensus in the next month on a DRM
standard that would protect the property of the movie industry from
theft. This caused me to whisper to Vinnie that when the floor
returned to him, he should defer comment to Richard Stallman, who
was the most qualified and highest ranking IT professional in the
building.</p><p>When Jack finished, the Chair reluctantly deferred to Jack's
wishes and gave the floor to Vinnie. Vinnie then identified himself
as a member of NY Fair Use and asked to defer the answer the
Richard. Richard stood up, but the Chair didn't let him talk, in
violation of the rules of order. Instead he said, &ldquo;We've already
accidently added one of your members to the panel&rdquo;. He saw no
reason why we should be allowed to have another member voice their
opinion. This caused the audience to get visibly upset. In
response, I intervened and said:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Pardon me, Mr. Chair, but Mr. Valenti nicely
pleaded that the leaders of the IT industry come to a consensus on
DRM. However, one of the greatest figures in the computing field is
standing right here, as part of NY Fair Use group. Richard Stallman
has just been given an award in France by the United Nations for
his contributions to World Heritage with the invention and
development of the GNU/Linux system and its variants. He's the most
qualified person in the room to make a public comment in response
to Mr Valenti's request.</p></blockquote></div><p>My intervention quieted the crowd, as nobody wanted things to
break down into a raucous confrontation. Though Richard was still
denied a chance to speak, our discipline confirmed that the meeting
could continue without derailing the workshop.</p><p>However, much of the conversation from that point forward was
affected by the events. The Digital Recording Rights Coalition
presented more forcefully their position that DRM eroded fair use.
Jack, in order to convey how serious the MPAA is about getting DRM
enacted quickly, said that while the MPAA responded to a letter
from Microsoft about progress toward DRM in 24 hours, that when the
MPAA sent such a letter to Microsoft, Microsoft took a long time to
respond. Microsoft at this point all but threatened to buy out all
of the movie producers if they continued to be such a pain in the
neck. Although this was not their exact words, their threat was
neither veiled or lost on Mr Valenti.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jack tried to persuade the panel that the movie
industry had never really been against the VCR. This caused some
agitation among the panelists, and the crowd laughed. The panel
pointed out that despite the movie industry's professed love for
the VCR, they brought an injunction against panel members whose
companies made VCRs&mdash;an injunction that was eventually defeated in
the Supreme Court.</p><p>But Jack was not the only panel member capable of bald-faced
lies. EMI tried to convince everyone that artists really don't hate
their record labels, but only say so in public because its good PR.
Later they claimed the record labels weren't responsible for
preventing music from being available and said it is the artists'
fault. AOL Time Warner delightfully wants to close the analog hole.
And a bunch of other positions were espoused, many of which have
been covered by Slashdot ad nauseum and need not be repeated
here.</p><p>At the end of the session, everyone on the panel had a chance
to express themselves exactly as they wished. When it finished, Jay
announced that NY Fair Use was having a press conference in front
of the Commerce Department Building at 4:30 PM. I gave this press
conference with the help of Richard and Jay, and we talked
extensively with reporters from Bloomberg and other media
organizations. We announced our position, and we announced our
proposal for the NY Fair Use &ldquo;Fair Use Bill&rdquo;.</p><p>NY Fair Use attained almost all of our goals for this action.
The phrases &ldquo;We are the stakeholders&rdquo; and &ldquo;DRM is theft&rdquo; have begun
to make their way into the press. We are being invited to a new
panel on DRM for consumers, the merits of which we are debating
now. We are leery of the formation of another panel and question
whether it is a stalling tactic. And we have reiterated our
position that NY Fair Use wants a seat with the original panel.
Capitol Hill was abuzz the next day with our activities. And
Congressman Weiner's Office has promised to lead the efforts to
bring us onto the panel in the future.</p><p>NY for Fair Use has kicked down the door that everyone else
will now run through.</p><p>You are welcome.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Ruben Safir</b></span> is cofounder of
