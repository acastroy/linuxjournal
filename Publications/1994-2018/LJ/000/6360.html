<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/xstatic/community/suitwatch" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/xstatic/community/suitwatch</a> for your own
subscription.</p><p>When I showed up at the
<a href="http://digitalhollywood.com" target="_self">Digital Hollywood</a>
conference in Beverly Hills last week, I didn't expect much in the
way of connectivity. Free wireless Net access, now almost standard
at computer industry conferences, was out of the question.
Net-connected PCs in the speaker and press rooms were a long shot.
Frankly, I didn't even expect to find dial-up there. So I wasn't
disappointed to find none of it.</p><p>What did surprise me was finding zero
<span   class="emphasis"><em>demand</em></span> for it. The opening session, &ldquo;Feature
Distribution and the Threat of Internet Piracy: Evaluating the
Short &amp; Long Term Implications&rdquo;, was packed, yet I was the only
member the audience with a laptop. I couldn't have felt farther
from the Internet if I had been on a desert island. The only
familiar face at the conference,
<a href="http://jd.manilasites.com" target="_self">J.D. Lasica</a> of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Online Journalism Review</em></span>, smartly anticipated
the problem by not even bothering to bring a laptop.</p><p>Sitting next to J.D., I felt like we were a couple of pirates
hiding in the cove of an island targeted for destruction by
Hollywood's Joint Chiefs. Generals from Universal, the MPAA and
MovieLink (a joint creation of five major studios) were gathered on
that very stage to strategize about what their industry is starting
to call
<a href="http://www.hotjobs.com/cgi-bin/job-show?J__PINDEX=J985729OQ" target="_self">&ldquo;P2P
warfare&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>Karen Randall, Executive VP and General Counsel for Universal
Studios, said &ldquo;we'll win this war&rdquo; by &ldquo;maximizing outcomes&rdquo; from a
&ldquo;full frontal assault on illegal downloading&rdquo;. She was encouraged
by &ldquo;excellent interpretations&rdquo; of the DMCA, and the &ldquo;export&rdquo; of
that law through a &ldquo;global lobbying effort&rdquo;.</p><p>But I feared no evil. No, not only because Linux was with me
but because Linux was with the audience&mdash;whether they knew it or
not. Technologists&mdash;of which there were approximately none in
attendance&mdash;put it there.</p><p>This became clear in a later panel, when the moderator asked
how many people in the audience had a TiVo machine at home. Nearly
every hand went up. Then he asked how many would honestly admit
they used their TiVo to fast-forward through the ads. Just about
every hand stayed up.</p><p>TiVo runs on Linux. It's also
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000813mag-boombox.html" target="_self">a
product of Jim Barton and Mike Ramsay</a>, two Silicon Valley
engineers. Not Hollywood, and not the consumer electronics industry
(though Sony and others quickly put money behind it, as well as
brakes on its wheels).</p><p>It was around the TiVo subject that the Hollywood's
disconnection from digital reality was fully revealed. That moment
came in the Keynote Roundtable session at the end of day
two.</p><p>When the moderator asked John Mass, Senior VP with William
Morris Consulting, what he made of the TiVo phenomenon, Mass
suggested that TiVo had neglected to use its most powerful
marketing message: the oft-heard customer statement that &ldquo;it
completely changed the way I watch television&rdquo;. But then Mass went
on to say he's &ldquo;not so worried about it&rdquo; because &ldquo;it's a very
efficient market... just like traditional television. People watch
what they want to watch, and they don't watch the junk out there.&rdquo;
He went on to talk about how the audience was growing because the
number of programs and channels were proliferating, which meant
more marketing opportunities.</p><p>But then he was interrupted by Jonathan Taplin, President and
CEO of Intertainer, who said, &ldquo;If TiVo scrapes off the top 30% of
the demographic customers, and those people are fast forwarding
through ads, there has to be some readjustment.&rdquo;</p><p>Mass replied, &ldquo;I won't be able to sell advertisers, that's
right, and the consumers will unfortunately be the beneficiaries of
that.&rdquo; Then he caught himself and added &ldquo;what will happen is that
the consumers will not get as good programming&rdquo;.</p><p>Taplin replied,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Let's look at the larger skew. There are today
380 digital television networks. Ten years ago there was one
Discovery Channel. Today there are fourteen Discovery Channels. Now
you cannot tell me there is fourteen times as much advertising
money flowing into Discovery Channels. They have fourteen times as
much programming costs, fourteen times as much satellite
transponder costs.... This is a train wreck. This cannot sustain
itself, especially if you add PVR (personal video recorders such as
TiVo) on top.... At the end of the day...there isn't a way to
sustain this.</p></blockquote></div><p>Tom McGrath, President of Paramount Enterprises and EVP of
Viacom Entertainment Group, said</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;We...are heavily dependent on first-run
licensing from major TV networks to survive. If you follow through
the train of logic that John Taplin started with, it's not a pretty
picture.... The evidence from TiVo is basically people just don't
watch commercials at all. It's not a question of watching the ones
they are interested in or not interested in.... It is a
transformation of the industry. As producers we rely on the fact
that there is a market for good programming. Right now the
penetration of these devices, of VoD (Video On Demand), of this
disintermediation, is not so great that we face collapse in the
near or intermediate future. But it's something that we think about
all the time.</p></blockquote></div><p>Taplin responded,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>It would seem to me that Viacom is probably
better positioned to weather the storm that is coming than almost
any other major media company. AOL Time Warner is $30 billion in
debt. That means the first $3 billion of profits goes to pay the
banks. Vivendi Universal has $20 billion in debt. Disney has $25
billion in debt. These are companies that have been leveraged to
the neck. If you think about the deflationary economy, which is
where we are going, the pricing power&mdash;whether for VoD, or DVD
rental, or for advertising&mdash;is not going to happen. Viacom was
smart enough not to do anything stupid in the Internet space, and
will probably weather this. But I am here to say that it is going
to be a very rough two or three years for the media sector.</p></blockquote></div><p>In the panel &rdquo;Hollywood vs. Silicon Valley: Will the Federal
Government Decide?&ldquo;, Michael Petricone, VP of Technology Policy
with the Consumer Electronics Association, wearily pointed out that
the P2P technology Hollywood hates is nothing other than the
Internet itself. &rdquo;P2P is not an add-on&ldquo;, he said. &rdquo;It's the genius
of the Internet.&ldquo; He presented a raft of statistics that show music
and movie sales doing just fine, to say the least, with DVD sales
up 80%. He also said the 7% decline in record sales in the current
economy should count as a big success. He also chided Hollywood for
its &rdquo;focus on litigation&ldquo; and for lobbying Congress to pass laws
that prohibit Net-based innovations. He said &rdquo;copyright owners
should continue developing ways to protect at the source&ldquo; (and not
in the network or end-user devices), and &rdquo;any restrictions should
be narrowly crafted.&ldquo; He summarized his advice by borrowing from
the Hippocratic oath: &rdquo;First, do no harm.&ldquo;</p><p>Donald Whiteside, Intel's VP, Legal Affairs and director of
the company's Broadband and Content Program Office, took the same
side. When he said &rdquo;Piracy is not a vision we support&ldquo;, he implied
two meanings: 1) he's not in favor of stealing, whatever that
means; and 2) he's opposed to characterizing fair use of computing
devices as piracy. He said technology was at best a &rdquo;deterrent&ldquo; and
&rdquo;we need to realize that we are not here to create technology as a
policing mechanism&ldquo;. His strongest point was also his subtlest.
Speaking for his side of the debate, he said, &rdquo;the technology
industry is focused on creating a digital marketplace&ldquo;.</p><p>With <i  >Linux Journal</i> on my badge, I was
challenged at schmooze time to describe the &rdquo;business propositions&ldquo;
of stuff that's free. The default Hollywood assumption is, &rdquo;There
aren't any.&ldquo; They chant &rdquo;You can't compete against free&ldquo; and &rdquo;You
can't sell free&ldquo; as if they were mantras. Meanwhile the F-word is
the most common sales pitch in the world.</p><p>So here's how I made my case. The basic Linux business
proposition, I said, is simple: <span   class="emphasis"><em>What can you do with a
free operating system that runs on anything and supports any
application you can name?</em></span></p><p>The Internet proposition, I added, was the same:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>What can you do with a network that connects everybody,
carries everything and embodies nobody's agenda?</em></span></p><p>You always get good answers to those kinds of questions from
entrepreneurs. You also get them from intrapreneurs within
established companies and from technologists ready to take
advantage of opportunities they see better than anybody else. But,
you won't get those answers from large companies&mdash;at least not
right away. Michael Miron, CEO of ContentGuard, described the
situation this way: &rdquo;When you add new technologies to old
industries, you get wrong answers.&ldquo;</p><p>In
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/policy/2002/08/15/lessig.html" target="_self">his
famous speech</a> at the O'Reilly Open Source Convention in
July, Lawrence Lessig framed the same point as a four-stanza
refrain for a song:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Creativity and innovation always builds on the
past.</p></li><li><p>The past always tries to control the creativity
that builds upon it.</p></li><li><p>Free societies enable the future by limiting this
power of the past.</p></li><li><p>Ours is less and less a free society.</p></li></ul></div><p>But when old industries survive changes as radical as those
caused by the Internet and Linux, it's often because technologists
working on the inside take advantage of new conditions, usually
without permission from senior management. That's what happened
with the Net, and it's what's happening with Linux. Show me a
company with a Linux &rdquo;strategy&ldquo;, and I'll show you a company
rationalizing choices already made by its own engineers.</p><p>For evidence, look no farther than Hollywood. Three years
ago, film production mostly involved machines and software from
SGI, Apple and Microsoft. The software was all proprietary and
expensive; and in the case of Apple and Microsoft platforms,
trouble-prone. Two years ago, Linux had already become the default
OS for backend rendering. The movie <span   class="emphasis"><em>Shrek</em></span>, for
example, involved Linux-based &rdquo;render walls&ldquo; involving more than a
thousand processors. Today Linux is more than competitive in the
frontend production workstation market, it's is winning there
too&mdash;big-time.</p><p>In his August 2001 <i  >Linux Journal</i>
<a href="../088/4803.html" target="_self">cover story</a>, Robin Rowe reported
on Dreamworks SKG's rapid adoption of Linux workstations and
applications. Then in May of this year, he
<a href="../000/6103.html" target="_self">reported</a> that the Ink and Paint
department of Dreamworks' Glendale studio was using Linux frontend
tools to produce <span   class="emphasis"><em>Spirit, Stallion of the
Cimarron.</em></span> In that piece, he quotes Ed Leonard,
Dreamworks' Head of Animation Technology: &rdquo;Now all the departments
have been converted. For our current production,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Sinbad</em></span>, every workstation and the entire
renderfarm is Linux.&ldquo;</p><p>S, K and G, by the way, are the initials of Spielberg,
Katzenberg and Geffen. Is it pure coincidence that we rarely if
ever hear these gentlemen whining to Congress about piracy and
theft? Or that their partner for VoD over the Net is Taplin's
Intertainer, the most pioneering of the VoD companies? I'm not
saying any of these guys are even close to taking technology's side
in this &rdquo;war&ldquo;; but it's clear they're hip to the future in
departments where engineers put clues to work.</p><p>On the last day of Digital Hollywood, a local conflict broke
out when Intertainer
<a href="http://www.intertainer.com/news/49.html" target="_self">filed an
anti-trust lawsuit</a> against Time Warner, Vivendi
International and Sony Pictures, accusing them of conspiracy to fix
prices in digital entertainment distribution. According to
Intertainer, those three companies control 56% of the movie market
and 63% of the music market.</p><p>And [October 3 was] the
<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/10/02/BU80477.DTL&amp;type=business" target="_self">eve
of the deadline</a> imposed by House Judiciary Committee member
James Sensenbrenner for some kind of compromise among webcasters,
over-the-air broadcasters, the RIAA, intermediators such as
RealNetworks and AOL, and lawmakers on the issue of royalties for
playing copyrighted music on the Net.</p><p>The politics of the matter are too complicated to describe,
but they're easy to sort out if you apply Lessig's Lesson and draw
a line between the future and the past. Linux and the Net are
entirely on the future side of that line. Technology companies like
Intel and Apple are crossing the line only so far as it takes to do
business with the &rdquo;content providers&ldquo; of the other side. They are
joined on the future's side by the Consumer Electronics
Association, though CEA members like Sony and Panasonic still
belong to cartels largely run by the entertainment industry.
Pioneering entertainment companies like Dreamworks and Intertainer
are stretching as far as they can to side with the future.
Microsoft is riding high on the straddle. From the outside they
appear to be siding with Hollywood; but insiders and former
insiders paint a far more
<a href="http://mediagora.blogspot.com/2002_09_01_mediagora_archive.html" target="_self">complicated
picture.</a></p><p>What's clear is that technologists on both sides are siding
with the future. If you care more about opportunities than threats,
put your bets on those guys.</p></div></div>
