    Motorola, a major player in the embedded systems market, announced it will begin using Lineo's Embedix, based on Caldera's OpenLinux, in its products. A very exciting announcement in the area on which the October <i  >Linux Journal</i> will focus.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1538580.0x1630190"></a></h2></div></div><p>Our upcoming October issue will focus on
Linux and embedded systems, and much excitement currently surrounds
this arena. Notably, the rumors concerning a partnership between
Motorola and the newly named Lineo (formerly, Caldera Thin
Clients). On August 5, I participated in a conference call with
Noel Lesniak, the Business Manager of Linux Telecom Platforms for
the Motorola Computer Group; Brian Sparks, the CEO of Lineo; and
Ransom Love, the CEO of Caldera Systems. Here's what they had to
say.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1538580.0x1630298"></a>Noel Lesniak, Motorola</h2></div></div><p>On Monday, August 9, the Motorola Computer Group is
announcing a unified Linux strategy that provides our OEM (original
equipment manufacturer) customers with a broad selection of Linux
based platforms, open source software, service and support,
training and integration services. In support of this broad
initiative, we're collaborating with two leaders in the Linux
community, Lineo and Caldera Systems. As always, MCG is committed
to providing our customers with the solutions they need to help
them succeed in today's global marketplace. We believe that
combined with the right hardware and support, the Linux operating
environment is ready for embedded design-ins and deployments in the
markets we serve: telecommunications, imaging and industrial
automatons. We believe that the reliability, performance and
flexibility of Linux as well as an open availability of source code
will speed time to market and help reduce development costs for our
OEM customers.</p><p>When deciding to enter the Linux game, we looked for
companies who knew Linux and its environment and whose strategies
complemented our own. Lineo, for example, has focused on embedded
software products and the OEM markets for many years. They have
experience with Linux and the Open Source community and they have
an embedded Linux strategy that is complementary to MCG's embedded
focus and our Linux strategy. Lineo's focus on customized embedded
Linux also fits with our traditional focus of partnering with
independent software vendors who develop technology for our
embedded market. In addition to embedded Linux, we see a need for a
full systems distribution of Linux for our system customers.
Caldera Systems has focused on Linux business solutions and has
significant experience with the Open Source community and the Linux
market.</p><p>Caldera Systems has a strong strategy to further develop
Linux along with the Open Source community for the mission-critical
segment of the high-availability server market. MCG and Caldera
Systems are collaborating in bringing high-availability features to
the Linux solutions set on Motorola's compact PCI-based systems. On
Monday, we are also introducing a network appliance product, the
SLX Series, aimed at Internet, intranet and extranet networking
applications and the EMS Series for telecommunications and
industrial networking applications. The network appliance product
is a new family of Linux-based embedded platforms for Internet
networking applications such as web access, web security, web
caching and virtual private networks. It is aimed at a telecom OEM,
which is building network solutions for the growing number of
Internet service providers, government and business organizations,
work groups and telecommuters requiring cost-effective access to
the Internet.</p><p>SLX enables these OEMs to deliver low-cost, easy-to-use,
reliable and secure Internet connectivity quickly. With the
configuration flexibility of the SLX, MCG will provide OEM-specific
configurations of the platform to meet each of our OEMs' unique
product and marketing needs. The SLX Series will be showcased next
week at Linux World Expo. In one demonstration, it will run a live
satellite Internet link using satellite access software from
Helius. Satellites are ideal for applications such as IP Multicast
and remote Internet access. The SLX Series with high performance
and low cost is ideal for these demanding satellite services. The
other SLX demonstration will feature the instant network
out-of-the-box capability of software from Network Concierge. When
used with a standard browser and configuration wizard, such as that
provided by Network Concierge, the SLX Series eliminates the
complexity of integrating a stack of networking and server
equipment from multiple vendors.</p><p>Also to be announced next week is MCG's EMS Series for Linux.
This product is the first in MCG's new line of Intel-based embedded
system platforms integrating the Linux operating system. This
product can be used to power a variety of telecommunications,
Internet and industrial automation applications. This highly
scalable and customizable platform helps enable OEMs to deliver
cost-effective systems designed to meet an end user's
specifications.</p><p>OpenLinux from Caldera and Lineo is obviously a large part of
these product announcements in our Linux strategy. Working with
these companies, we plan to take the lead and expand the reach of
Linux into embedded and high-availability markets that require
rugged, reliable and scalable products.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1538580.0x1630558"></a>Brian Sparks, Lineo</h2></div></div><p>I'd like to give you a bit of context, as Lineo may be a name
you haven't heard before. Lineo was formerly running under the name
Caldera Thin Clients, which on July 20 was renamed Lineo to reflect
an emphasis on embedded Linux. Lineo's core focus is in defining
the embedded systems Linux market segment and maintaining a market
leader position in that market. Lineo is a wholly owned subsidiary
of Caldera Inc., which I helped found five years ago to advance
Linux software acceptance in the market. For the past several
years, Lineo and Caldera Thin Clients has given rebirth to DR DOS
in the embedded market and developed relationships with key OEMs
and other market vendors in the embedded space. Embedding Linux, we
feel, is a natural evolution for our company with a successful
history in the embedded market and with several years' knowledge in
Linux. Lineo creates an embedded Linux product under the name
Embedix; we license OpenLinux from Caldera Systems, which Ransom is
going to describe and I'm sure many of you already know. We target
OpenLinux into the embedded market. We feel the new relationship
with Motorola is significant. The Motorola Computer Group, of which
we are a part, has a large emphasis not only in telecom but in
other embedded devices. They are a large system board vendor, both
Power PC-based and X86-based, both of which we'll be targeting with
our embedded Linux solution.</p><p>How are we going to sell this product? Why is it unique? We
are actually developing two products. We are developing a developer
platform on which the OEM developer will sit at as he targets
embedded Linux solutions. We are adding appropriate capabilities
and functionalities so that the developer can choose the
functionality suite he or she wants on the target board. We are
targeting both Power PC and X86, as I mentioned. Our competitors in
this space are the traditional real-time operating systems. Thus,
we have to be cognizant of the features they offer to their
customer base as we are encroaching in their space. We think we
offer a very competitive product and a well-positioned one. It will
take a significant part of that market share quickly, partly
because of the popularity of Linux, and secondly, the natural
evolution we feel that Linux offers in the embedded market. We will
be adding real-time extensions to the kernel as appropriate for our
customers. We will offer products competitive with other vendors in
the real-time OS space. We feel we are well-positioned, and with
OpenLinux, we have a stable platform on which to encroach this new
market.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1538580.0x16306b8"></a>Ransom Love, Caldera Systems</h2></div></div><p>Caldera Systems has been a leader in providing Linux for
business solutions that enable the development and deployment of
Linux-based Internet devices and appliances that range from
embedded solutions all the way to high-end servers. We market those
products through a worldwide channel of OEMs, VARs and integrators.
We feel it's critical to productize Linux to provide these types of
business solutions, and thus, we have partnered with Lineo because
of their expertise in the embedded side to deliver the exclusive
OpenLinux offering to their embedded customers. So we are excited
about that component, and now many of those VARs and Integrators we
work with are looking for and are already deploying
high-availability, mission-critical applications and thus the
announcement with Motorola is key. They show a great deal of
leadership in integrating OpenLinux and Embedix into their
high-availability hardware solutions, which I think meet a very
real market need. We are very excited about the complete
relationship.</p><p>Caldera also focuses on providing a full range of service and
educational courses, where they are partnering with authorized
training centers. Motorola wants to provide a full set of services
to their OEM customers, and we are looking ahead to working with
Motorola in providing these types of solutions in order to move
forward.</p><p>Caldera Systems, as I mentioned, is Linux for business. We
are focused on delivering all solutions needed by those wanting to
deploy these types of Internet applications and the Internet
appliance solution which need to be effective in deploying them in
an actual business setting. Therefore, we think this announcement
of a combination of expertise and focuses in key markets is a very
significant announcement in the industry. Obviously, Motorola
brings their leadership in providing both embedded and
high-availability solutions, and Lineo and Caldera Systems bring
their Linux expertise. We are looking forward to seeing the
result&mdash;the actual business solutions&mdash;this partnership will bring
to the industry as it moves forward.</p></div></div>
