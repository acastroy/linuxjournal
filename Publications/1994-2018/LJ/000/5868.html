You came home from school one day, and your computer screen looked
different. Your dad told you, &ldquo;There are gonna be a few changes
around here.&rdquo; You had to learn how to open e-mail all over
again.</p><p>Maybe it feels like you've been yanked out of your comfy
WYSIWYG world and thrown into the void of uncertainty&mdash;abandoned
for the sake of powerful computing.</p><p>You might be a Linux Waif.</p><p>How can you know for sure? Do you recognize any of the
following tell-tale signs?</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Has your dad removed what he calls &ldquo;the unnecessary
keys&rdquo; from the keyboard?</p></li><li><p>Is your monitor bigger than your TV?</p></li><li><p>Does your dad's license plate read ILUVLNX or
LNXROX or LNXRULZ, etc.? Does the other car's plate read
IH8MS?</p></li><li><p>When a big virus hits everyone's computer where
your dad works, does he come home really happy?</p></li><li><p>Is there a dartboard in your garage with a
strangely familiar, nerdy-looking guy's face stuck on it?</p></li><li><p>Has your little brother's teacher ever sent a note
home to your parents asking them to please tell him not to refer to
the class computer as &ldquo;sucky&rdquo;?</p></li><li><p>When you come home from school and tell your dad
about your PowerPoint presentation, does he get a blank look on his
face?</p></li><li><p>Have you ever wondered why your dad gets so excited
about open sores?</p></li><li><p>Have you ever overheard your little brother getting
into a fight where the bully says, &ldquo;My dad can beat up your dad&rdquo;,
and your brother replies, &ldquo;Yeah, but my dad can build me a computer
out of spare parts in our basement&rdquo;?</p></li><li><p>You go to a friend's house and his dad shows off
his bowling trophies. When your friends come over, does your dad
show them his original <i  >Linux Journal</i>, still in
the plastic?</p></li><li><p>Have you ever tried to ask your dad something about
one of your homework problems and he interrupts you to exclaim,
&ldquo;This book's written in LaTeX!&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>Have you ever overheard your mom showing your
little brother the new Spiderman underwear she bought him when your
dad wanders by and asks, &ldquo;Hey! Do they have those with
penguins?&rdquo;</p></li></ol></div><p>Anything sound familiar? Don't worry, Waif. You're really not
alone. He's doing it for your own good, and he has another name for
you anyway&mdash;Second Generation Linux User.</p></div></div>
