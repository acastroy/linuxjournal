    Behind the scenes of the open-source bills: smoke-filled rooms,
    naive optimism and on and off the record.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22e9580.0x23e1240"></a></h2></div></div><p>In this article, we look at the process
of getting legislation passed at the state level of government.
Against that backdrop, we explore how our efforts fared in
supporting this year's open-source bills. Finally, we look at what
proponents of Linux need to do to succeed in our objective of
having governments adopt open-source standards.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22e9580.0x23e1348"></a>The Political Algorithm</h2></div></div><p>The state legislative process appears consistent throughout
the United States. A citizen can petition a member of the house
and/or senate to introduce a bill if the issue addressed has merit.
The First Amendment to the US Constitution established one's right
to petition Congress. The Supreme Court expanded the right beyond
the original wording.</p><p>In the electronic age, elected officials view the
transmission of faxes or e-mail as petitioning. If different
constituents send a letter of identical content, the receiving
official views that as a petition. That occurrence may compel the
member to assess/address the issue.</p><p>Other ways of initiating legislation exist. In the
circumstances of open-source legislation, sponsors' constituents
began by presenting a business case. For example, I presented an
argument based on cost savings. My senator (Senator Carona of
Texas) liked the idea and moved forward. According to Carona's
senator's aide, I presented more research than was needed. Most
lobbyists or special interests achieve results with far less
information. Fortunately, Senator Carona knew about Linux and
open-source software as a businessperson.</p><p>If you want to initiate legislation in your own state, keep
in mind that your presentation helps in formulating their ideas.
Present a compelling case. Let legislators take your idea and
develop it further. They have to own the idea before they can
successfully share it with other members.</p><p>Once the legislator develops the idea, he or she drafts the
bill and files it with the secretary of state or equivalent
functionary. Once filed, an official of the house or senate reads
it to the assembled body for the first time. At this point, the
official enters the reading into the official record and refers it
to a committee. In the case of SB 1579, a bill to make the state of
Texas consider OSS, the State Affairs Committee of the Senate
received the bill. It remained dormant on the committee's agenda
until the chairman announced a public hearing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22e9580.0x23e15b0"></a>The Battle Begins</h2></div></div><p>I didn't know it at the time, but the supposedly dormant bill
drew immediate opposition from lobbyists. Other legislation may
encounter opposition from a number of sources, such as other
constituents, associations and special interest groups. SB 1579
became targeted by Microsoft. Members of the committee received
visits from lobbyists and documents aimed at discrediting
open-source software.</p><p>During the same period, Chip Rosenthal of EFF-Austin put SB
1579 on the group's agenda and their foundation endorsed it. For
the next two months, Chip became the equivalent of an unpaid
lobbyist. In most causes, he did the legwork of a typical lobbyist
and a community supporter.</p><p>I also discovered that the senator had to make a number of
requests before the committee would schedule a public hearing for
the bill. Scheduling a hearing can be difficult. Being an
influential and well-liked representative such as Senator Carona
helps this process.</p><p>Many factors may have contributed to the committee's busy
agenda. Many of us believe lobbyists got to at least the chairman
of that committee; he was not present for the hearing. Fortunately,
a hearing took place and no one present killed the bill.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22e9580.0x23e17c0"></a>Our To-Do</h2></div></div><p>At this point, proponents of a bill can begin the process of
support. On its web site, the state publishes the names and contact
information for the members of each committee. Receiving e-mails,
faxes and letters from the public helps committee members recognize
the bill's support in the community. Such support can outweigh the
influence of lobbyists, as constituents are the ones who elect
legislators.</p><p>We do not know how much support Oregon's similar open-source
bill received at this particular stage. We do know that SB 1579's
committee received little, if any community support. EFF-Austin
(the Posse) did ask members of the Texas Open Source community to
help. A copy of one of the appeals exists on the
<a href="http://www.dfwuug.org/archives/public/discuss/2003-March/000016.html" target="_self">NTLUG
archives</a>. Considering the effort put forth by the Posse,
one has to wonder what else we need to do to mobilize the Open
Source community in these matters. Here's an excerpt:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>SB 1579 is proposed Texas state legislation that
will require state agencies to consider &ldquo;open source software&rdquo; when
purchasing computer software. The bill has been introduced in the
Senate, referred to committee, and is awaiting a schedule date for
a hearing.
</p><p>Action Needed:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Fax or write members of the Senate Committee on
State Affairs to express your support of the bill. For contact
info, see
<a href="http://wiki.effaustin.org/index.php/SenateCommitteeOnStateAffairs" target="_self">.</a></p></li><li><p>Join our SB 1579 mailing list (see below).</p></li></ul></div><p>EFF-Austin has announced its endorsement of SB 1579.
EFF-Austin supports the use of open source technology, and believes
this bill will help further its use by Texas state agencies. By
expanding its use of open source, the state will be able to take
advantage of the most advanced, new technologies while
significantly reducing its information technology costs.</p></blockquote></div><p>Texas's bill received a public hearing and remained in
committee. One has to give credit to the senator sponsoring the
bill and the skill of EFF-Austin in staging support at the
hearing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22e9580.0x23e1d40"></a>On the Record: the Committee Hearing</h2></div></div><p>The purposes of the committee hearing are to flush out the
topic and provisions of a bill, obtain constituent input and listen
to vested interests. Considering the associations registered as
opposition, the people of the state had scant
representation.</p><p>At this point, let's consider the rights of the people as
defined by the First Amendment. The First Amendments reads,
&ldquo;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging
the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people
peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress
of grievances.&rdquo;</p><p>The right of petition expanded as the result of a Supreme
Court ruling in favor of an industry coalition in EASTERN R. CONF.
v. NOERR MOTORS, 365 U.S. 127 (1961) 365 U.S. 127. The right of
petition no longer lives in the confines of demanding &ldquo;a redress of
grievances&rdquo;. It allows an exercise by the government of its powers
in furthering the interest and prosperity of the petitioners and
their views on politically litigious matters. Essentially, this
allows people to petition Congress to initiate legislation to
advance commercial interests.</p><p>This decision went against the lower court rulings, where the
plaintiffs had demonstrated that railroad's business practices
resulted in restraint of trade. This important decision opened the
door for you and I to request legislation for open-source software.
It also allowed a company like Microsoft to fund groups to support
its interest, despite the fact that those interests do not
necessarily benefit the interests of the citizens of Texas or any
other state.</p><p>At the hearing, the opposition can testify against the bill.
It sets the stage by lobbying against it in the first place. In
Oregon, I can only guess what went on between the filing of bill
and the hearing. Looking at the results, though, I think the
lobbyists out-influenced the constituents.</p><p>One may wonder how the industry lobby of a monopolist
represents interests of the people. I too can only question the
logic of this supposition. In this particular legislative session,
Texas cut funding for health and human services, while licensing
fees continue to make their way to Redmond, Washington.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22e9580.0x23e2000"></a>Off the Record: Before the Committee
Vote</h2></div></div><p>Neither Texas nor Oregon saw their bills make it to the next
stage; call that a failure to influence our representatives. The
failure began prior to the committee hearing and after the hearing.
People familiar with legislative procedures call this stage the
informal process. It begins after the public hearing and is where
the smoke-filled room metaphor originated.</p><p>In Texas, a letter writing campaign could have forced SB 1579
out of the informal process and into a vote. Unfortunately, the
bill did not have the attention of the members. As the session came
to an end, the committee reduced the bill's priority.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22e9580.0x23e2160"></a>If the Bill Leaves Committee</h2></div></div><p>In the normal course of legislation, a bill reaches the stage
where it is voted on and moved out of committee. The committee
looks at the testimony during the original hearing and considers
the information gathered during the informal process. After
discussion, they vote either to kill the bill or to recommend it to
the general membership. Once it hits the floor of the membership,
it receives a second reading where the members discuss the bill in
open forum.</p><p>If we do our job, we get the community to go on a letter
writing campaign aimed at the larger membership of the voting body.
In the case of Texas, the senate membership would receive faxes,
e-mails and letters. In Oregon, the community would inform the
House membership.</p><p>As those faxes, e-mails and letters pile up in the office
trays of the members, they pay attention. In the past, people have
told me otherwise, but now I know each member's staff does watch
those indicators carefully.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22e9580.0x23e2318"></a>The Third Reading and The Vote</h2></div></div><p>If it passes on the floor of the originating body, the bill
then is sent to the other legislative body and goes through the
same process. If amended, it goes to a conference committee. This
is where the lobbying gets hot and heavy.</p><p>If the bill passes the second legislative body, it then goes
to the governor for signing. If signed, it becomes law; a
regulating body must promulgate it into practice. To this end, the
regulatory body writes its interpretation of the law and begins
enforcing it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22e9580.0x23e2478"></a>Smoke-Filled Rooms</h2></div></div><p>Conspiracy theorists of the world like the notion of
smoke-filled rooms where politicians and wealthy barons of industry
plan the destiny of working class Americans. Fortunately, the
anti-tobacco movement succeeded, and smoke no longer fills those
rooms. Some other grass root reforms also succeeded, as we did not
see any politicians in smoke-filled rooms either.</p><p>Given the apathy I observed from the community, people truly
must believe in the myth of smoke-filled rooms&mdash;the myth where no
one makes a difference. The myth allows us to abdicate our
responsibilities because, after all, our fate lies in someone
else's hands.</p><p>If you believe that, I have a bridge in Brooklyn I'd like to
sell you. Otherwise, I hope to see you next session.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom Adelstein</b></span> works as a
