    Better scalability, reliability, security and performance are part of the upgrades of the new Apache server.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26b1580.0x27a9190"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Apache Project is a collaborative
software development effort aimed at creating a robust,
commercial-grade and freely available source code implementation of
an HTTP web server. The project is jointly managed by a group of
volunteers located around the world, using the Internet and the Web
to communicate, plan and develop the server and its related
documentation. These volunteers are known as the Apache Group. In
addition, hundreds of users have contributed ideas, code and
documentation to the project.</p><p>According to the Netcraft web servers survey, Apache has been
the most popular web server on the Internet since April 1996. This
comes as no surprise due to its many characteristics, such as the
ability to run on various platforms, its reliability, robustness,
configurability and the fact that it is free and well-documented.
Apache has many advantages over other web servers, such as
providing full source code and an unrestrictive license. It is also
full of features. For example, it is compliant with HTTP/1.1 and
extensible with third-party modules, and it provides its own APIs
to allow module writing. Other interesting features that have made
it a popular web server include the capability to tailor specific
responses to different errors, its support for virtual hosts, URL
rewriting and aliasing, content negotiation and its support for
configurable, reliable piped logs that allows users to generate
logs in a format they want.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26b1580.0x27a92f0"></a>The Jump from 1.3 to 2.0</h2></div></div><p>Apache 1.3 has been a well-performing web server, but it
suffers a few drawbacks, such as its scalability on some platforms.
For instance, according to Martin Pool, AIX processes are
heavyweight, and a small AIX machine serving a few hundred
concurrent connections can become heavily loaded. In such
situations, using processes is not the most effective solution and
a threaded web server is needed.</p><p>Furthermore, with the evolution of the requirements imposed
on web servers, new functionalities like higher reliability, higher
security and further performance are required. In response, web
servers must evolve to satisfy these demands. Apache is no
exception, and it continues its drive to become a more robust and a
faster web server with its new 2.0 version (see sidebar).</p><p><a href="4559s1.html" target="_self">Sidebar</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26b1580.0x27a9500"></a>Portability</h2></div></div><p>Apache is renowned for its portability because it works on
several platforms. However, having the same base code of Apache
portable on so many platforms comes with a high price, which is the
ease of maintenance. The Apache server has reached a point where
porting it to additional platforms is becoming more complex.
Therefore, in order to give Apache the flexibility it needs to
survive in the future on more platforms, this problem had to be
addressed and resolved. As a result, Apache will be able to use
specialized APIs, where they are available, to provide improved
performance, making it easy to port to new platforms.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26b1580.0x27a9608"></a>Apache Portable Runtime</h2></div></div><p>Apache was intended initially to work on standard UNIX
systems. However, its support for other platforms grew and the
number of platforms supported affected the simplicity of the source
code. One effect is that the code makes extensive use of
conditional compilation to cope with platform peculiarities.
Writing to a standard POSIX API is also undesirable on some
platforms that provide substandard implementations or faster
paths.</p><p>To solve these problems, Ryan Bloom is leading efforts to
develop a solution, a layer called the Apache Portable Runtime
(APR). The APR presents a standard programming interface for server
applications and covers tasks such as file I/O, logging, mutual
exclusion, shared memory and managing child processes and
asynchronous I/O. APR shields the application from
incompatibilities in the implementation of the standard, and thus
it will use the most efficient way to achieve each function on each
supported particular platform.</p><p>Another component that helps to resolve portability problems
is Ralph Engelschall's MM library, which hides the details of
setting up shared memory areas between processes and provides an
interface similar to malloc to manipulate them.</p><p>The MM library is a two-layer abstraction library that
simplifies the usage of shared memory between forked processes
under UNIX platforms. On the first (lower) layer, it hides all
platform-dependent implementation details (allocation and locking).
When dealing with shared memory segments and on the second (higher)
layer, it provides a high-level malloc(3)-style API for a
convenient and well-known way to work with data-structures inside
those shared memory segments.</p><p>The traditional Apache structure is based on a single parent
process and a group of reusable children (see Figure 1). The parent
reads the configuration and manages the pool of children. Each
child at any time is either serving a single request or sleeping.
Apache 1.x automatically regulates the size of the pool of children
so that there are enough to cope with spikes in load without using
too many resources to maintain idle processes. Busy children serve
one request at a time on a single socket.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4559f1.large.jpg"><img src="4559f1.jpg"></a></div><p> <span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. Traditional Apache
Structure</b></span>
</p><p>Some web sites are heavily loaded and receive thousands of
requests per minute or even per second. Traditionally TCP/IP
servers fork a new child to handle incoming requests from clients.
However, in the situation of a busy web site, the overhead of
forking a huge number of children will simply suffocate the server.
As a consequence, Apache uses a different technique. It forks a
fixed number of children right from the beginning. The children
service incoming requests independently, using different address
spaces. Apache can dynamically control the number of children it
forks based on current load.</p><p>This design has worked well and proved to be both reliable
and efficient; one of its best features is that the server can
survive the death of children and is also reliable. It is also more
efficient than the canonical UNIX model of forking a new child for
every request.</p><p>This traditional Apache design works well up to quite high
loads on modern UNIX systems. On Linux in particular, context
switches and forking new processes are cheap, and accordingly this
simple design is nearly optimal. One drawback, however, of the
isolation between processes is that they cannot easily share data,
and consequently sharing session data across the server takes a
little work.</p><p>Another approach is to serve each request in a separate
thread: this is the model used by most NT-based web servers.
Although this approach eliminates most of the protection between
tasks, it allows the module programmer more flexibility and it can
be faster on systems where threads are cheaper than processes, such
as Windows NT and AIX.</p><p>Apache 2.0 introduces MPMs (multiple-processing modules) that
hide the process model from most of the code. At runtime, Apache
can be configured to use threads, processes, a hybrid of both or
some other model. Modules can register new process models to suit
their operating systems or the applications. One proposed example
is to fork processes that run as different users to give increased
security on machines that offer virtual hosts to multiple
customers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26b1580.0x27a9be0"></a>Performance</h2></div></div><p>Apache's developers have always emphasized the security,
correctness and flexibility of the server. However, as of Apache
1.3, many efforts were directed towards bringing performance up to
par with other high-end web servers were minimal. With the
continuous explosive growth of web traffic, Apache 2.0 tries to
improve its throughput without compromising its other
qualities.</p><p>Web servers have several key performance determinants. Some
of these factors include the amount of memory available to hold the
document tree, disk bandwidth, network bandwidth and CPU cycles. In
most cases, people add to or upgrade the hardware to improve the
performance of their web servers. Nevertheless, with the explosive
growth of the Internet and its increasingly important role in our
lives, the traffic on the Internet is growing at over 100% every
six months. Thus, the workload on the servers is increasing rapidly
and these servers are very easily overloaded. Several options exist
to overcome this problem, besides hardware upgrades or
additions.</p><p>For very busy web servers, the kernel overhead of switching
tasks and doing I/O becomes a problem. Apache provides a solution
for the high traffic problem through the mod_mmap_static module.
This module ties files into the virtual memory space and avoids the
overhead of &ldquo;open&rdquo; and &ldquo;read&rdquo; system calls to pull them in from the
filesystem. This process can result in a good increase in speed
when the server has enough memory to cache the whole document
tree.</p><p>Furthermore, to improve the performance and to serve more
requests per second, administrators can run a specialized web
server that handles simple requests and passes everything else on
to Apache. Another approach that cuts the operating system overhead
is to have a small HTTP server built into the kernel itself. These
two approaches are discussed later (see HTTPD Accelerators).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26b1580.0x27a9df0"></a>I/O Layering</h2></div></div><p>Apache modules through version 1.3 wrote directly to the TCP
connection back to the client. This arrangement was simple and
efficient, but it lacked flexibility.</p><p>An example of this inflexibility would be secured
transactions over SSL. To perform encrypted communications, the SSL
module must intercept all traffic between the client and the
handler module. With no abstraction layer in place, this was a
difficult task made even more difficult by the cryptography laws of
the 1990s that prohibited adding convenient hooks. Administrators
wanting to run secure sites had the choice of applying inelegant
patch sets to the Apache source or using a proprietary and perhaps
incompatible binary distribution.</p><p>In Apache 2.0 (with APR), all I/O is done through abstract
I/O layer objects. This arrangement allows modules to hook into
each other's streams. It will then be possible for SSL to be
implemented through the normal module interface rather than
requiring special hooks. I/O layers also help internationalized
sites by providing a standard place to do character set
translation.</p><p>In addition, with later Apache releases, I/O layers may
support a &ldquo;most requested module&rdquo; feature that will have one module
filter the output of another. However, this may not happen with
Apache 2.1.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26b1580.0x27aa000"></a>Multiple-Processing Modules (MPM)</h2></div></div><p>The original reason for creating Apache 2.0 was to solve
scalability problems. The first proposed solution was to have a
hybrid web server, one that has both processes and threads. This
solution provides the reliability that comes with not having
everything in one process, combined with the scalability that
threads provide. However, this approach has no perfect way to map
requests to either a thread or a process.</p><p>On Linux, for instance, it is best to have multiple
processes, each with multiple threads serving the requests. If a
single thread dies, the rest of the server will continue to serve
more requests and the server will not be affected. On platforms
that do not handle multiple processes well, such as Windows, one
process with multiple threads is required. On the other hand,
platforms with no thread support had to be taken into account, and
therefore it was necessary to continue with the Apache 1.3 method
of preforking processes to handle requests.</p><p>The mapping issue can be handled in multiple ways, but the
most desirable way is to enhance the module features of Apache.
This was the reasoning behind introduction of multiple-processing
modules (MPMs). MPMs determine how requests are mapped to threads
or processes. The majority of users will never write an MPM or even
know they exist. Each server uses a single MPM, and the correct MPM
for a given platform is determined at compile time.</p><p>Currently, five options are available for MPMs. All of them,
except possibly the OS/2 MPM, retain the parent/child relationships
from Apache 1.3, which means that the parent process will monitor
the children and make sure that an adequate number is
running.</p><p>MPMs offer two important benefits:</p><p>1. Apache can support a wide variety of operating systems
more cleanly and efficiently. In particular, the Windows version of
Apache is now much more efficient, since mpm_winnt can use native
networking features in place of the POSIX layer used in Apache 1.3.
This benefit also extends to other operating systems that implement
specialized MPMs.</p><p>2. The server can be customized better for the needs of the
particular site. For example, sites that need a great deal of
scalability can choose to use a threaded MPM, while sites requiring
stability or compatibility with older software can use a
&ldquo;preforking&rdquo; MPM. Additionally, special features like serving
different hosts under different user IDs (perchild) can be
provided.</p><p>The prefork MPM implements a non-threaded, preforking web
server that handles request in a manner similar to the default
behavior of Apache 1.3 on UNIX. A single control process is
responsible for launching child processes that listen for
connections and serve them as they arrive.</p><p>Apache always tries to maintain several spare or idle server
processes, which are ready to serve incoming requests. In this way,
clients do not need to wait for a new child process to be forked
before their requests can be served.</p><p>The StartServers, MinSpareServers, MaxSpareServers and
MaxServers (set in /etc/httpd.conf) regulate how the parent process
creates children to serve requests. In general, Apache is
self-regulating, so most sites do not need to adjust these
directives from their default values. Sites that need to serve more
than 256 simultaneous requests may need to increase MaxClients,
while sites with limited memory may need to decrease MaxClients to
keep the server from thrashing.</p><p>While the parent process is usually started as root under
UNIX in order to bind to port 80, the child processes are launched
by Apache as less-privileged users. The User and Group directives
are used to set the privileges of the Apache child processes. The
child processes must be able to read all the content that will be
served but should have as few privileges as possible beyond
that.</p><p>MaxRequestsPerChild controls how frequently the server
recycles processes by killing old ones and launching new
ones.</p><p>The PTHREAD MPM is the default for most UNIX-like operating
systems. It implements a hybrid multi-process multi-threaded
server. Each process has a fixed number of threads. The server
adjusts to handle load by increasing or decreasing the number of
processes.</p><p>A single control process is responsible for launching child
processes. Each child process creates a fixed number of threads as
specified in the ThreadsPerChild directive. The individual threads
then listen for connections and serve them when they arrive. The
PTHREAD MPM should be used on platforms that support threads and
that possibly have memory leaks in their implementation. This may
also be the proper MPM for platforms with user-land threads,
although testing at this point is insufficient to prove this
hypothesis.</p><p>When compiled with the DEXTER MPM, the server starts by
forking a static number of processes that will not change during
the life of the server. Each process will create a specific number
of threads. When a request comes in, a thread will accept it and
answer it. When a child process sees that too many of its threads
are serving requests, it will create more threads and make them
available to serve more requests (see Figure 2).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4559f2.jpg"></div><p> <span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2. Dexter MPM Model</b></span>
</p><p>The DEXTER MPM should be used on most modern platforms
capable of supporting threads. It will create a light load on the
CPU while serving the most requests possible.</p><p>The WINNT MPM is the default for the Windows NT operating
systems. It uses a single control process, which launches a single
child process that in turn creates threads to handle
requests.</p><p>The PERHILD MPM implements a hybrid multiprocess,
multithreaded web server. A fixed number of processes create
threads to handle requests. Fluctuations in load are handled by
increasing or decreasing the number of threads in each
process.</p><p>A single control process launches the number of child
processes indicated by the NumServers directive at server startup.
Each child process creates threads as specified in the StartThreads
directive. The individual threads then listen for connections and
serve them when they arrive.</p><p>An MPM must be chosen during the configuration phase and
compiled into the server. Compilers are capable of optimizing many
functions if threads are used, but only if they know that threads
are being used. Because some MPMs use threads on UNIX and others
don't, Apache will always perform better if the MPM is chosen at
configuration time and built into Apache.</p><p>To choose the desired MPM, you need to use the argument
<b  >--with-mpm= <i><tt>NAME</tt></i></b> with
the ./configure script, where <span   class="emphasis"><em>NAME</em></span> is the name
of the desired MPM (dexter, mpmt_beos, mpmt_pthread, prefork,
pmt_os2, perchild).</p><p>Once the server has been compiled, one can determine which
MPM was chosen by using <b  >% httpd -l</b>. This command
will list every module that is compiled into the server, including
the MPM.</p><p>The following list identifies the default MPM for every
platform:</p><p>&lt;il&gt;BeOS: mpmt_beos&lt;il&gt;OS/2:
spmt_os2&lt;il&gt;UNIX: threaded&lt;il&gt;Windows: winnt
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26b1580.0x27aac08"></a>HTTPD Accelerators</h2></div></div><p>As mentioned previously, web server performance can be
improved in many ways. Besides upgrading the hardware running the
server, HTTPD accelerators can be deployed. Users can either run a
specialized web server to handle simple static requests and pass
all other requests to Apache (or any other web server) or have a
small HTTP server built into the kernel itself. Proofs of concept
for both approaches are phhttpd (pointy-headed httpd) and khttpd
(kernel HTTP d&aelig;mon).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>phhttpd</b></span> serves all requests
from a single process and uses the &ldquo;sendfile&rdquo; system call to put
most of the work back into the kernel, besides interpreting the
HTTP protocol. <span   class="bold"><b>phhttpd</b></span> cannot run
on its own, as it requires a backing full server that knows how to
talk with phhttpd, such as Apache. The two servers establish a line
of communication while running.
<span   class="bold"><b>phhttpd</b></span> listens to all the
incoming connections, and if it can't parse the request for
whatever reason, it hands the connection over its line to Apache to
process. <span   class="bold"><b>phhttpd</b></span> keeps an
aggressive cache of content that doesn't change at each request. It
uses this content to reduce the amount of processing that must be
done per request. It also features a nonblocking event model that
allows a single thread to serve many connections. The number of
threads may be scaled to match the size of the hosting
machine.</p><p>To cut out the operating system overhead, a small HTTP server
can be placed into the kernel itself to respond to requests for
static files. It runs from within the Linux kernel as a module,
handles only static web pages and passes all requests for nonstatic
information to a regular user space web server such as Apache.
Static web pages are not complex to serve, but they are important
because virtually all images are static, as are a large portion of
the HTML pages. A regular web server has little added value for
static pages; it is simply a &ldquo;copy file to network&rdquo; operation, and
the Linux kernel is good at this.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26b1580.0x27a17b0"></a>Ericsson Research Canada and the Apache
Server</h2></div></div><p>ARIES (Advanced Research on Internet E-Servers) is a project
that started at the Open Architecture Research Lab at Ericsson
Research Canada in January 2000. It aimed to find and prototype the
necessary technology to prove the feasibility of a clustered
internet server that demonstrates telecom-grade characteristics
using Linux and open-source software as the base technology. These
characteristics feature guaranteed continuous availability,
guaranteed response time, high scalability and high
performance.</p><p>Building a high-performance and scalable system requires a
web server that can keep up with hundreds of requests per second.
The Apache web server is one of three web servers that we have
tested. Our test system is a telecom grade 16-processor cluster
targeted for carrier-class server applications. It was featured in
the April issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, where we
discussed our experiments with the Linux Virtual Server.</p><p>In an upcoming article, we will discuss Apache's performance
in more detail and evaluate the performance of several other web
servers, such as Jigsaw and Tomcat to see how they compare to each
other. However, to give you a sample of how Apache 2.0 performs, we
installed Apache 2.08 on a PIII server node with 512 MB RAM and
started to generate HTTP requests to it using WebBench, a web
server's benchmarking tool (see Figure 3).</p><p><a href="4559f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.
Apache 2.08 Performance</b></span></a></p><p>Apache 2.08 was able to respond to an average of 817 requests
per second, servicing up to 104 concurrent clients. One important
factor is that this server node is diskless and Apache was serving
the documents from an NFS partition (which presented some
limitations). In other tests, we noticed much better performance
(more requests/second) when Apache was servicing documents sitting
on the server disk itself.</p><p>Based on our tests, we believe that Apache is considerably
faster, more stable and more full-featured than other web servers.
We look forward to testing and experimenting with the 2.0 release
version, which promises clean code, well-structured I/O layering
and enhanced scalability.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26b1580.0x27a1b78"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The Apache project will continue to be an open-source project
that keeps up with advances in the HTTP protocol and web
developments in general. The people behind the project are open to
suggestions for fixes and improvements, and they respond to needs
of large volume providers as well as occasional users. Part of
Apache's original success was due to the numerous tests conducted
by both developers and users. The Apache Group maintains rigorous
standards before releasing any new version of the server, and when
bugs are reported, the developers release patches and new versions
as soon as they are available. If you are an IT manager or a system
administrator currently using Apache 1.3.x, I highly recommend
upgrading to Apache 2.0 once the release version is
available.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26b1580.0x27a1c80"></a>Acknowledgment</h2></div></div><p>Thank you to Martin Pool for his permission to reuse material
