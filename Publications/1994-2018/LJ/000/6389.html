    Is India serious about Linux in education, or just setting
    the stage to ask Microsoft founder Bill Gates for a handout when
    he visits in November?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24f0580.0x25e8240"></a></h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Economic Times</em></span>,
India's most influential business newspaper, has dropped hints of
government plans to push a &ldquo;countrywide drive&rdquo; to promote GNU/Linux
as the &ldquo;platform of choice&rdquo;. But Indian enthusiasts of Free/Libre
Software and open source are treating the promises with skepticism,
if not downright suspicion.</p><p><a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/cms.dll/articleshow?artid=24598339" target="_self">On
October 9, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Economic Times</em></span> published an
article</a>, &ldquo;Open IT&mdash;Government to Rewrite Source Code in
Linux&rdquo;, which caused a flurry of interest and then doubt. The
article, which appeared on October 9, said:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>the Indian government seems to be taking a leaf
out of China's operating system, and is planning a countrywide
drive to promote the open source operating system, Linux, as the
'platform of choice' instead of 'proprietary' solutions.</p></blockquote></div><p>The feature article ran on the front page of many editions of
the paper across India, but some were quick to call it a lie.
GNU/Linux groups were buzzing with comments on the report, largely
critical. Their opinion is the claim is little more than a
bargaining chip to extract a better deal from the dominant
proprietary software player, Microsoft.</p><p>Without giving too many specifics or naming any official as
sources, the article said India's Department of Information
Technology &ldquo;has already devised a strategy to introduce Linux and
open-source software as a de-facto standard in academic
institutions, especially in engineering colleges through course
work that encourages use of such systems.&rdquo;</p><p>It further claimed that Indian research establishments &ldquo;would
be advised&rdquo; to use and develop &ldquo;re-distributable tool-boxes just as
Central government departments and state governments would be asked
to use Linux-based offerings&rdquo;.</p><p>At the root of much of the criticism is the question of
whether laudable statements purportedly coming from the top could
make a difference across this vast and diverse country.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24f0580.0x25e86b8"></a>Other Examples</h2></div></div><p>Some time back, the small western coastal state of Goa
(population 1.35 million, area 3,700 square kilometers) officially
announced a policy in favour of GNU/Linux. But within a few months,
the politician behind the policy&mdash;former Goa information technology
minister, Ramakant Khalap&mdash;walked out of the government in a huff.
This policy appears to have come to naught, due the departure of a
single individual.</p><p>Some of the other points the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Economic
Times</em></span>'s article made included a quote from an unnamed
&ldquo;senior government department&rdquo;:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>As a first step we are persuading all government
institutions to offer courses on Linux and programming for Linux
environment. We would also set up Linux Resource Centres in
academic institutes (with co-funding from government and
industry).</p></blockquote></div><p>The article also noted that software superpower India itself
finds software costly within the country. This costs could really
hit once IPR (intellectual property rights) are implemented in
earnest, as currently a lot of proprietary software is illegally
copied.</p><p>Repeatedly citing the Chinese policy example, the article
pointed out that Microsoft committed to invest $750 million in that
country over three years to back a software college, while
investing only one-tenth that sum in India. The
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ET</em></span> argued Microsoft did this &ldquo;in what many
observers and reports say is an attempt to soften the Chinese
government's stand&rdquo;.</p><p>As in most other markets, Microsoft has overall dominance in
India. But emerging reports here suggest the company is worried
about the growing interest Indian software techies, who are
considered a potent force worldwide, have been showing in
GNU/Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24f0580.0x25e8a80"></a>Dropping Hints</h2></div></div><p>In recent times some other countries, such as neighbouring
Pakistan, have dropped hints that they also might use GNU/Linux as
a bargaining chip. Some see the pro-GNU/Linux statements as a way
to get proprietary software companies, particularly Microsoft, to
reduce what is seen in these low-income countries as unrealistic
prices that, in turn, fuel what proprietary software companies call
&ldquo;piracy&rdquo;.</p><p>Soon, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>ET</em></span> article was moving across
dozens of mailing lists on the Internet. Apart from a number of LUG
lists, it also made its appearance on networks like
<a href="http://mail.sarai.net/pipermail/solaris" target="_self">Solaris</a>,
the independent forum for IT and development issues.</p><p>Some posters welcomed the move. GNU/Linux enthusiast Dinesh
Shah, of Shah Micro Systems in the city of Bombay, commented:
&ldquo;(The) TCO (total cost of ownership) of Linux is less then half of
the Microsoft. It makes sense for a 'poor', 'third world',
'developing' country like India!&rdquo;</p><p>But the tone was soon to change. Others, such as Sridhar N,
wondered how many times GNU/Linux had made it to the headlines on
the front-page of the country's main business newspaper.</p><p>In Bangalore, considered the Silicon Valley of Indian
software, techies and GNU/Linux enthusiasts were more critical.
Early GNU/Linux evangelist Atul Chitnis wrote, &ldquo;However much I
would like to rejoice over this, I must sadly conclude that this is
probably a response to the announcement from yesterday that Bill
Gates is visiting India in November.&rdquo;</p><p>Chitnis argued that he was not saying &ldquo;that the Indian
government effort isn't true or good news&rdquo;. He conceded that, in
fact, there are &ldquo;tremendous efforts&rdquo; going on to use open standards
and open technologies. But &ldquo;it is just that the timing of the 'news
item' is a wee bit suspect&rdquo;. He added:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The DIT&mdash;or the Ministry of Information
Technology, now known as the Ministry of Communications and
Information Technology&mdash;may be &ldquo;talking&rdquo; to the IBMs and HCLs of
the world, but is that &ldquo;news&rdquo;? Sounds more like a commercial
'booster shot', since there is really no 'news' in the item.
</p><p>If the government was really going for an all-out push, it
should be talking to its citizens who are already using open-source
technologies at a frantic pace.</p><p>Frankly speaking this appears to be timed to put additional
pressure on Gates to be more 'generous' than he was on his last two
visits to India, nothing more.</p></blockquote></div><p>Bombay-based Jayathirth agreed with Chitnis. He wrote:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The (Indian) government sector is quite
disorganised in IT in first place, at least in the (western Indian
state of) Maharashtra. The only place where I see Linux or Open
source is TIFR (the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research) and
BARC (Bhabha Atomic Research Centre). BARC [being an atomic
research centre] is so heavily regulated that one can't declare it
openly. TIFR is still good.</p></blockquote></div><p>From the eastern metropolis of Calcutta (now Kolkata), P K
Sharma wrote:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>(We need to) interpret news, and separate the
kernel from the chaff. We all make such passive receivers of news,
as if 'news' is manna from heaven.
</p><p>(If this is a way to put more pressure on Bill Gates), what
an abominable way to beg for largesse from people whose blatant
objective is world dominance thru OS, software, .NET....&ldquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Pallav Nawani, of the Bangalore-based Sasken Communication
Technologies Ltd., cited other statements to back up his view. He
pointed to a recent interview where the Indian prime minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee was largely non-committal to questions about
Free/Libre and open-source software. &rdquo;All he said was that we are
definitely considering this, or some thing of the sort, and he did
make it clear that there was no push to promote open-source (at the
cost of closed-source) software,&ldquo; said Nawani.</p><p>Tanveer brought up the idea of corruption and bribes.
Specifically, he pointed out the province of Karnatakai. The
Department of I.T. in the province publicly supports open source,
even as &rdquo;all [the] police stations are being equipped with Windows
XP Professional&ldquo;.</p><p>Tanveer charges, &rdquo;Closed-source companies can pay them under
the table. Open source is free so there is no opportunity [of
bribes] there for the officials.... What matters is that due to
this announcement, now they will get more kickbacks.... Their
intelligence is laudable!&ldquo;</p><p>Many people allege that this kind of corruption is a routine
part of government business in the Third World. Therefore, such
factors could be playing a role in blocking the speedier acceptance
of Free/Libre and open-source software in the Third World.</p><p>However, moves to push for GNU/Linux are underway in many
different spheres in India, even if a much-hyped and often-promised
push from the top is seen as more lip-service.

the Indian Ministry of Communication and Information Technology,
the Electronic Research and Development Centre of India
(ER&amp;DCI) and the Bangalore-based Indian Institute of
Science.</p><p>Free Software Foundation founder Richard M. Stallman also has
shown increased interest in visiting the second-largest country on
the globe. India's thousand-million-plus population and software
talent could shape the world of computing in the years to
come.</p><p>As connectivity spreads across India, a growing number of
young Indians are contributing to the global pool of GNU/Linux
programming. Free Software Foundation-India recently registered as
a not-for-profit company, under Section 25 of the Indian Companies
Act. Stepped-up attempts also are on to find Indian-language
solutions for GNU/Linux-based computing.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Fred Noronha</b></span> is a freelance
