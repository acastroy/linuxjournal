    Politics as unusual: starting the good fight
    against doomed political opposition to cyberspace.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xaf7580.0xbef2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Many years ago the late Sixties
revolutionary Jerry Rubin was a guest on Dick Cavett's show. Rubin
went on about how <span   class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span>--education, sex,
driving, sleeping, coughing, you name it&mdash;was about politics. After
listening patiently to Rubin's rantings for awhile, Cavett said,
&ldquo;Politics bores my ass off.&rdquo; It brought the house down.</p><p>I remember thinking, &ldquo;my sentiments exactly.&rdquo;</p><p>I'm a Sixties guy too. I went to college in Greensboro, North
Carolina from '65 to '69 and marched there against the Vietnam war,
racial segregation, union busting and other mainstream sentiments
of that time and place. Afterwards in New Jersey, I worked for a
series of government social programs. When funding for those ran
out, I launched my career as a journalist by raking muck for local
newspapers, often by giving government a hard time.</p><p>To the degree that stuff was political, I was involved in
politics. But, truth be told, politics bored my ass no less than
Dick Cavett's. In junior high I avoided Civics class like it was
Home Ec. And though I've always tried to exercise my right to vote,
I've tended to favor none-of-the-above candidates. I have rarely
voted for somebody who won.</p><p>So I've always been amazed at people who get off on politics
or who even consider it important. Like a lot of folks around the
Linux/Free Software/Open Source communities, I have a mile-wide
libertarian streak. I agree with Jefferson that &ldquo;government that
governs best governs least&rdquo;.</p><p>But there are people in government who want to govern
something I value, and I believe most of our readers value as
well&mdash;something that is inherently ungovernable and that derives
its value from the consent of its ungoverned billions of
constituents: the Internet.</p><p>In the
<a href="http://www.ssc.com/pipermail/suitwatch/2002q1/000016.html" target="_self">March
7 issue</a> of
<a href="http://www.ssc.com/mailman/listinfo/suitwatch" target="_self">SuitWatch</a>,
my biweekly newsletter for <i  >Linux Journal</i>, I
ranted about the DMCA, which is terrible legislation, and about
CARP, which proposes terrible regulations based on the DMCA. I
closed the piece with a plug for
<a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig" target="_self">Larry
Lessig</a>'s
<a href="http://www.creativecommons.org" target="_self">efforts</a> to
define the Net as a commons, rather than as a piping system for
highly controlled &ldquo;content&rdquo;:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I suggest we join Larry there. And I suggest he
join us in a Million-Customer March on Washington.I'm serious.
Isn't it time we gave Congress a friendly lesson in the democratic
nature of real markets?</p></blockquote></div><p>What followed supports the Law of Intended Consequences. Jeff
Gerhardt of <a href="http://www.thelinuxshow.com" target="_self">The Linux
Show</a> not only got turned on by the idea, but he picked up
the ball and ran it for a touchdown and extra points.</p><p>The current manifestation of Jeff's effort, with help from
<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pjones" target="_self">Paul Jones</a> (of
<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org" target="_self">Ibiblio</a>),
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr" target="_self">Eric S. Raymond</a> and
myself, is a
<a href="http://www.thelinuxshow.com/otc.htm" target="_self">public
proposal</a> for the creation of two entities&mdash;a consortium
and a political action committee&mdash;built for the purpose of
advocating the Net to lawmakers and regulators. The document
explains itself, and will keep explaining itself every time we
redraft it. So I won't expand here on what it says or
proposes.</p><p>I will expand, however, on some of what I think about the
inherent ungovernability of the Net.</p><p>As Monty of Ogg Vorbis put it to me a few weeks ago, &ldquo;there's
a reason it's called cyber<span   class="emphasis"><em>space</em></span>, not
cyber<span   class="emphasis"><em>pipes</em></span>&rdquo;. Like outer space, it's infinite.
Like inner space, it's personal. Unlike both, though, it exists
between individuals, between things, between documents, nodes,
services and other entities. Its hyperlinked nature is all
between-ness. In fact it creates a new kind of space:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>inter</em></span> space. And we're only beginning to
explore it.</p><p>As David Weinberger (one of my <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cluetrain</em></span>
co-authors) puts it in his brilliant new book,
<a href="http://www.smallpieces.com" target="_self"><span   class="emphasis"><em>Small Pieces
Loosely Joined</em></span></a>, this new kind of space defies
description in terms of more familiar spacial concepts:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Traditional space as a container, as the grand
&ldquo;outside&rdquo; of everything that exists, is passive. But the Web in
effect actively holds itself together. If I write a page, it
becomes part of the Web, and thus extends the Web place, only if
someone links to it. Otherwise it's simply a page no one will ever
find. Through these billions of acts of will the Web is constructed
and expanded.</p></blockquote></div><p>Later he adds,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>there's an important difference in the politics
of space as well. In the real world, I can't just put a door from
my apartment to my neighbor's so that anyone can go through. But
that's exactly how the Web was built. Tim Beaners-Lee originally
created the Web so that scientists could link to the work of other
scientists without having to ask their permission. If I put a page
into the public Web, you can link to it without asking me if it's
all right with me, and without even letting me know you've done
it.</p></blockquote></div><p>Note his reference to &ldquo;the politics of space&rdquo;. This is not
far from the same space John Perry Barlow advocated in
<a href="http://www.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html" target="_self">A
Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</a>, back in
1996:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Governments of the Industrial World, you weary
giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of
Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us
alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where
we gather.
</p><p>We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one,
so I address you with no greater authority than that with which
liberty itself always speaks. I declare the global social space we
are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek
to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you
possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to
fear.</p><p>Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the
governed. You have neither solicited nor received ours. We did not
invite you. You do not know us, nor do you know our world.
Cyberspace does not lie within your borders. Do not think that you
can build it, as though it were a public construction project. You
cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our
collective actions.</p></blockquote></div><p>So why, if this space we've made is inherently ungovernable,
do we make the effort to save it from government? Two short
answers: 1) to save history some time and 2) to relieve ourselves
of a pain in the ass.</p><p>The longer answer is far more important: <span   class="emphasis"><em>To learn
what it is we're making that's worth fighting for</em></span>. I
think we've only begun to understand it.</p></div></div>
