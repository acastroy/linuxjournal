    A preview and summary of the January 11th episode of Phil Hughes' weekly radio show featured on Biz Soup.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13d8580.0x14d0138"></a></h2></div></div><p>Many of you may not remember, but there
was a fight over the Linux trademark a few years back. It turns out
that a person who had nothing to do with Linux registered the
trademark, then asked all the businesses in the Linux community for
10% of their gross sales for the use of &ldquo;his&rdquo; trademark.
</p><p>What happened next was one of the best examples of what Linux
is all about. A group of us, coordinated by Linux International,
put together a cooperative effort to rescue the trademark. In spite
of being competitors and having different ideas as to what the
right disposition of the trademark was, we all cooperated&mdash;both in
our appearance of unity, and financially&mdash;to rescue the trademark
and get it into the hands of the good guys. As I'm sure you are
aware, the rescue effort was a success.</p><p>What's important here is why we cooperated. It would be nice
to say that everyone involved was just a nice person (or a nice
company). While I have a lot of respect for most of the people
involved, there is more to it. We all saw the potential of Linux,
and realized that if deployment of Linux could go forward, we all
could grow our businesses. Time has proved this to be
correct.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13d8580.0x14d02f0"></a>The New Face of Linux</h2></div></div><p>While Linux has been commercial to the extent of businesses
selling products to the Linux community since 1993, a significant
change happened in 1999. With existing public companies such as
Informix, IBM, HP and Compaq getting on the Linux bandwagon and
IPOs from previously private companies in the Linux space, the
rules of the game have changed. We now have significant players in
the Linux arena whose primary responsibility is to their
shareholders, and it is not likely that shareholders in companies
such as IBM have more interest in the future of Linux than in their
own personal gain.</p><p>The good news is that members of the Linux community can
recognize this and treat them appropriately. Sure, we want these
new players, but we also realize that what is best for our
community and what is best for a big corporation with a Linux
sideline are not necessarily the same thing.</p><p>To me, the bigger concern is what could happen with our own
players. While the scenario I outline below could happen with any
Linux distribution manufacturer, I use Red Hat as an example
because they are in the news again with their purchase of Hell's
Kitchen Systems.</p><p>Red Hat has done a good job of establishing their brand so
that many see Red Hat and Linux as synonymous. This is very similar
to the earlier practice of referring to computers as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>IBM&nbsp;machines</em></span>. It makes business sense on
Red Hat's part, but also helps them grow at the expense of at least
the other Linux distribution vendors. I feel it is also at the
expense of the Linux community as a whole because, taken to the
extreme, we end up with a fragmented Linux market competing against
Microsoft.</p><p>How can this happen? I don't know Red Hat's plans, but if
they decide to turn Cygnus and HKS into &ldquo;Red&nbsp;Hat-only&rdquo;
companies, producing software that runs on only the Red Hat flavor
of Linux, then we start to produce this problem. The direct effect
is that other Linux distribution vendors lose market share. That is
the short-term problem, but not the significant one.</p><p>The next thing that happens is other software vendors see
Linux as a less-viable platform for a port of their software,
because there is no longer one Linux to port to. While this may
sound good, the consumer then sees less of a choice in selecting a
Linux distribution. This is hard to sell to a consumer who has been
advised to flee Microsoft because they don't offer a choice.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13d8580.0x14d0608"></a>Is There an Alternative?</h2></div></div><p>I feel there is. The first step was establishing the Linux
Standards Base project. This is an effort to create a core
functionality made available by Linux. Once in place, vendors will
be able to port to this standard and test their software against a
standard distribution. If their software runs against the standard,
then it should run on any Linux distribution subscribing the the
LSB standards effort. Unfortunately, LSB could be too late.</p><p>In the meantime, I think a good alternative is possible. It
is time to cooperate again. I believe it's time to start what I
will call &ldquo;The Linux Company&rdquo;. It would be a for-profit company,
owned by other Linux distribution manufacturers. It would then
invest in (or possibly purchase) companies that would benefit the
whole Linux community. For example, if SoftLogik, a company that
produces a layout program, were to commit to a port of their
software to Linux, The Linux Company could chose to invest. One
condition would be, of course, that the Linux port would run on all
Linux distributions represented by The Linux Company.</p><p>I don't see this idea as a replacement for the LSB effort. I
see it as something that would help the effort along. LSB is
primarily technical. This would be a tool that would help move the
importance of those technical issues into the realm of corporate
leaders.</p></div></div>
