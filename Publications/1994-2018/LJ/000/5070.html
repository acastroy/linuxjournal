    Microsoft's tactics are too risky. What's a would-be monopolist to do? Why not use copyrights and patents instead? After all, they're state-guaranteed, legal monopolies. Now if we can just get over this silly idea that they should be limited ...
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28e5580.0x29dd138"></a></h2></div></div><p>Microsoft's guilty, says Judge Jackson.
Is this good news for Linux? Here's the short answer: Yes and no.
Here's the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; part: Microsoft's adversaries now have a potent
weapon&mdash;Jackson's decision&mdash;and they'll use it the minute the
Redmondians step out of line. Whatever happens in the appeal
process, Microsoft will need to be nice for a while. That means
Linux can do what superior technologies <span   class="emphasis"><em>ought</em></span>
to do: gain market share. Actually, there's nothing new here.
According to industry observers, Microsoft <span   class="emphasis"><em>has</em></span>
been playing more nicely for some time now. With the spotlight
trained on the firm's every action, they'd darned well better. As
long as Microsoft's muzzled, it seems, Linux can look to a
Halloween-free future. (The so-called &ldquo;Halloween&rdquo; documents
disclose internal Microsoft musings about various nasty things the
company could do to ward off the Linux threat.)</p><p>But there's a &ldquo;no&rdquo; part, too. Basically, Judge Jackson's
decision sends a very powerful signal to the industry's attack
dogs: Microsoft's game plan is too darned risky. It involves
strong-arming suppliers and customers to obtain a commanding market
share, a <span   class="emphasis"><em>de facto</em></span> monopoly, which you maintain
using tactics that may cross the line separating legal and illegal
behavior. The whole thing could blow up in your face. It happened
to IBM. It happened to Microsoft, which emulated and perfected
IBM's tactics. (Apparently, Microsoft isn't much more innovative in
business strategy than it is in technology.) What worries me is
that the attack dogs will switch wholeheartedly to a game they've
only toyed with until now: using copyrights and patents for the
same, anticompetitive purposes. The result could well be a world in
which companies that have created absolutely nothing are able to
obtain exclusive control of their markets&mdash;and it will all be
perfectly legal.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28e5580.0x29dd3a0"></a>A Perfectly Legal Monopoly&mdash;and It's Backed by
the State</h2></div></div><p>Why risk creating monopolies illegally when the government
will hand you a legal one? It's important to understand that
copyrights and patents <span   class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> monopolies&mdash;that's
the very essence of the whole idea of intellectual property. If you
get a copyright or patent, you get the right to market it
exclusively. What's more, all this is perfectly legal. And if
that's not enough, copyrights and patents are guaranteed by the
full force and power of the State; if someone infringes, the State
intervenes on your behalf. They'll throw the bastards in jail, if
necessary, should they dare to intrude on your right to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>exclusive</em></span> control of the market.</p><p>Now <span   class="emphasis"><em>that's</em></span> a monopoly! Sure, copyrights
and patents are only <span   class="emphasis"><em>temporary</em></span> monopolies,
granted for a &ldquo;limited time&rdquo; so that creative people and inventors
can profit from their innovations. However, in the past 50 years,
the U.S. courts, state legislatures, and U.S. Congress have
exaggerated the privileges of copyright and patent holders to the
level of ultimate absurdity&mdash;that is, to the point that these
privileges overwhelm fundamental rights guaranteed by the
Constitution, such as freedom of speech. Intellectual property is
well on its way to becoming real property, and the implications for
the marketplace are troubling indeed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28e5580.0x29dd660"></a>The Chamber of Legislative Horrors, Part I:
UCITA</h2></div></div><p>Skeptical?Just take a look at UCITA, the model
sale-of-software goods legislation that is now under consideration
in all 50 U.S. states. Of all the odious provisions of this bill,
one of the most frightening is the way it transforms the
traditional concept of copyright. In traditional copyright law,
one's responsibilities to the copyright holder are discharged once
you've bought the new book and paid your royalties to the author.
This is the doctrine of <span   class="emphasis"><em>first sale.</em></span> UCITA
throws first sale out the window. Once you've agreed to the &ldquo;click
here&rdquo; license, you've also thrown away your rights to turn around
and transfer the product to a third party. To do so, you'll need to
get permission from the software publisher first. Can you imagine
what's going to happen next time you sell a computer? You'd better
have permission to transfer all the software on your system,
including all the clip art, applications, utilities&mdash;the works.
This won't affect consumers, probably, but it's going to be a
nightmare for businesses.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28e5580.0x29dd7c0"></a>Reverse-Engineering the Law: More Fun with
UCITA</h2></div></div><p>Let's just consider another of UCITA's dandy little
provisions, those that effectively prohibit reverse engineering.
The courts have steadfastly defended reverse engineering as a
fundamental right of free speech. After all, an organization
concerned about security needs to know how a program works&mdash;and if
the vendor won't divulge the needed information, the organization
can rightfully reverse-engineer the program to discover whether any
undocumented security holes exist. That is, they could until UCITA.
If UCITA becomes law, software publishers can stick you with a
license that forbids reverse engineering, and they may very well
succeed in making this prohibition hold up in court.</p><p>What's really at stake here isn't just security. A
cornerstone of the constitutional concept of intellectual property
is just this: ideas are <span   class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span> in the public
domain. According to traditional copyright, a programmer cannot
protect the ideas in a new program, only the code. Of course,
software publishers have turned to patents in an effort to protect
software ideas, and the uncomprehending courts have given them just
about everything they've asked for. Right now, there's a truly
frightening process going on in which the U.S. Patent Office is
handing out patents willy-nilly for even the most trivial or
inconsequential computer algorithms, including many that are known
to have existed for years. As I've argued in an earlier column,
software algorithms are analytically indistinguishable from the
scientific truths of nature, which are not subject to patents. This
is a monstrous error, and the solution requires nothing less than
an affirmation that software algorithms are beyond the scope of
patent protection. But don't hold your breath.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28e5580.0x29dd978"></a>Concerned About the Public Good? Well, Shut Up!
(The DMCA)</h2></div></div><p>You can see the same pattern in all the new legislative acts
that purport to shape the new digital millennium. According to the
U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (1998), copyright owners
don't need a court-approved injunction to go after material they
judge to be infringing, as long as the material appears on the Web;
it's up to the accused infringer, rather than the copyright holder,
to go before a court and prove that the material does not, in fact,
infringe. This perversion of traditional and reasonable conceptions
of due process is already generating a &ldquo;chilling effect&rdquo; on free
speech. Just look what happened when hackers decrypted
CyberPatrol's banned site database. And what did they find? Errors
aplenty, and gaping holes in the database's coverage. The
deficiencies were sufficiently grave to cause genuine concern among
parents about the software's effectiveness. In a more enlightened
age, the publication of such material might have been successfully
defended in a court of law by pointing to the benefits derived by
consumers from the publication of such material. But not anymore,
thanks to the DMCA. Copyright is now the absolute right, not free
speech.</p><p>Sure, say the apathetic, this is bad legislation, but not to
worry&mdash;be happy&mdash;the courts will throw it out. But this is
na&iuml;ve, pure and simple. Law is accretive, building momentum by
the sheer weight of precedent and a whole series of laws that add
up to consistent intent. And that's just what's accumulating. Aided
by campaign contributions, massive lobbying efforts, and
legislative processes that seem to leave little room for
considerations of the public good, the information technology
industry is enlarging the scope of copyrights and patents on
multiple fronts&mdash;and they're winning.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28e5580.0x29ddad8"></a>Get the Government Out of Science and
Technology</h2></div></div><p>For the most part, the Linux community is gratified by Judge
Jackson's decision, but not without a certain ambivalence. Sure,
there's an argument that the government ought to step in to level
the playing field, and there's an extra attraction in that the
victim, this time, is none other than the Evil Empire itself. But
the Libertarians among us are quick to point out the risks of such
interventions. Even the most well-meaning laws can be crude,
politically motivated and outright counterproductive.</p><p>We'll argue about the merits of the Justice Department's
intervention in the Microsoft case for years to come. Personally, I
believe that antitrust laws are needed, and Microsoft's actions
show why they're needed. Still, I'm starting to think that my
Libertarian friends might have the edge, in the long run. It's
increasingly clear that the government is playing an dysfunctional
role in exaggerating the scope of copyrights and patents&mdash;a role
that could well become catastrophic. It's only a matter of time
before an aggressive company uses copyrights and patents to create
and sustain a total market monopoly&mdash;and one that stands up in
court&mdash;even though the company has originated absolutely nothing
and uses its state-guaranteed powers to push creative new players
out of their market. It's already happening, actually, albeit on
the small scale.</p><p>If we're serious about keeping the playing field level,
there's only one possible solution: the U.S. government (and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> governments) should place software
algorithms beyond the scope of patent protection, roll back
legislation that equates copyrights to real property, and roll back
the duration of copyrights to a period no greater than the life of
the author. To do anything less is to threaten the very foundations
of economic, scientific and technological progress that have
created the twentieth century's economic boom.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bryan Pfaffenberger</b></span> is a
