Suits&rdquo;</a> was our first Linux-in-business
event<a  href="#footnote">*</a>, and it featured an
<a href="http://linuxforsuits.com/lfs_day.html" target="_self">impressive
series of panels</a>, starting with my one-on-one conversation
with Linus Torvalds himself, following Linus' own opening
remarks.</p><p>You can read the entire conversation below. It is transcribed
verbatim. Aside from demonstrating that few people speak in final
draft (and that Linus is closer to qualifying than I am), the whole
thing demonstrates the extreme difference between an actual event
and the news that issues from it.</p><p>On the one hand, Linus had some very intesting things to say
about the nature and shape of Linux and open-source development and
how that pertains to business&mdash;and also about a few other topics,
such as his interest in embedded uses for Linux. On the other hand,
what made the news was mostly his remarks about Sun and Microsoft
(plus, to a lesser extent, his remarks about embedded
Linux).</p><p>So here we have a fun chance to compare a verbatim interview
with the coverage that derived from it. Here are just a few
examples:</p><p>

Linux for Suits, the first Linux and Open Source executive forum
here at Internet World. We have put together quite a day here to go
over something that is a huge phenomenon just now breaking upon the
business world. I'd like to ask how many people here consider
themselves suits? I'm not seeing that many of us &ldquo;decked out&rdquo; this
morning. Who admits to that? I'm just curious, how many people here
had not heard of Linux two or three years ago? Quite a few. How
many people had not been using the Web, say, four or five years
ago? How many of us use the Web every day?</em></span></p><p>There is a pattern here, even though it isn't that obvious to
see. The Web was not something we could easily predict - the
Internet was not something we could easily predict - it's not
something that somebody owned, which is a critical thing. Nobody
promoted it, and still it is something that exploded on the world
and now we are all part of it even though nobody owns it. Something
very similar is happening with Linux right now, and I don't think
we understand it any better. I want to get some understanding on
how Linux works and what is behind this phenomenon and how in many
ways it resembles the wave of adoption we've seen with the Internet
over the last five years.</p><p>What we have with Linux is a radically different model for
developing software than most of us are used to. We go to the store
and order something that comes in a block of bits. Linux is
something radically different. Linux is something where the people
who build the stuff actually sign their work, so that if other
people want to see who did it - they can. It isn't just a matter of
wanting to get the credit or the esteem of their peers - even
though that is a powerful motivator. It is also so people can find
out who did this work and who to call when a problem shows up. An
interesting thing yesterday: I was talking to one of our guests
later on today, Jeff Davis with Amoratta Hess, who said, &ldquo;You know,
when I need help, sometimes I just look at who worked on this or
that part of the kernel or this or that part of Red Hat or some
other part of the software, and I call or write them and find out
what I can do with this piece of software.&rdquo; This is not something
you can do with Microsoft; this is not something you can do with
most software.</p><p>The person who sits at ground zero of this phenomenon is
Linus Torvalds, who has joined us this morning at great expense. He
just came in from Helsinki to San Francisco and flew a redeye in
here to join us - I think he looks in remarkable shape considering!
Linus is going to share a few words with us, then he and I are
going to sit down in front and have a brief interview followed by a
question and answer session. Here is Linus!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus:</b></span> I actually had a
stopover in San Francisco, and I had been home for a week before I
came on the redeye to New York. I'd like to actually explain the
kind of strange format here. If you read the opening remarks, you
think I'm going to give a speech, and I am not. There are several
reasons: one is simply, that yes, I did get the redeye, and I
probably couldn't keep track of a speech for more than five minutes
and then I'd just go out in strange directions because my mind
wanders. The other reason is simply that I hate writing speeches. I
don't have anybody that does it for me and it is just a waste of
time in my opinion, so the end result is sometimes strange. But the
real reason and the fundamental reason is that I thought there
would be a lot more &ldquo;suits&rdquo; here. And there is one rule that
everybody should always remember, and that is, you should never,
ever let a technical guy talk to a suit. Because if you do that,
the technical guy will say something embarrassing about the product
or something, and it just never works out. And you have to have a
chaperone, a PR person or a marketing person there, to filter the
information. That's why we set up this question and answer session,
and Doc is the chaperone. As it turns out, you seem to be a lot
more technical group than I would have assumed from just the title
of the talk. That is fine, because it probably means that if I
tried to make a talk for &ldquo;suits&rdquo; it wouldn't have gone over very
well, and this way, we can maybe modify the interview session a
bit. People can probably get their own input on what they want to
hear about. So I will turn it back over to the chaperone, and we'll
see where this goes.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: This is being
videotaped, so there may be some &ldquo;suits&rdquo; in the overflow room, but
we can keep them out of sight. The first question is a bit of a
&ldquo;suit&rdquo; question: did you have any idea when you wrote Linux - when
you just finished it for the first time - that anything like this
would happen?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Well, obviously not.
The whole situation has been completely unplanned and fairly
chaotic. I use chaotic they way physicists or mathematicians tend
to use the word &ldquo;chaos&rdquo;. There is an order; it's just that the
system is so complex you can't see the order from any kind of small
single action. It is an order that exists in the system, and that
has probably been the saving side of the project. There hasn't
really been much of a long-range plan; there wasn't an initial goal
that is even close to where we are now. I mean, there have always
been goals, but they've always been modified very extensively by
new people getting in, and just when you reach a milestone, you
notice you actually wanted to go in the other direction a bit. It's
been a very dynamic system and the fact that it actually has worked
- hasn't exploded, that it really hasn't become chaotic in the
traditional sense - shows in the non-mathematical sense that there
is actually more of an innate order to how large systems
work.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: I
think what is happening is that innate order is penetrating more
and more companies out there. The Linux development community is
not just something that is academic or scientific, although it may
also be that in a strict sense. One piece of interesting data is
some people from IBM (I shouldn't characterize this as all of IBM
because IBM is huge) at Linux World in August told me about how out
of 600 people they surveyed for Linux awareness in one technical
division, not only did all 600 know how to spell Linux, but 120 of
them were hacking kernel code. What IBM is aware of and a lot of
other large companies are aware of is, &ldquo;This thing has infected our
organization!&rdquo; But it's not really an infection any more than the
Internet is an infection. There was a lot of resistance to the
Internet at first, too. I see <span   class="emphasis"><em>less</em></span> resistance
to Linux in part because I think there is manifest in Linux some
truths about the way development ought to be.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Well, you may be
seeing less resistance to Linux now, but the situation has
certainly changed. One of the things I really enjoy about having
commercial companies come in - people always ask me if I mind
somebody taking Linux and trying to make a buck. And the answer is,
&ldquo;Hell no!&rdquo; I want these commercial people to come in and open doors
to places Linux wouldn't have gone otherwise, because it to do the
stuff I'm interested in which is the technical side and allows me
to do it in places where I couldn't have done it otherwise.</p><p>Two or three years ago, there was very much a barrier, and
the only way Linux tended to get into small or even large companies
was through engineers, through the back door. What's obviously
happened is that the kind of PR we've gotten - the Department of
Justice lawsuit certainly hasn't been detrimental to Linux either -
has meant suddenly you have the suits knowing about Linux, which
means it's even easier for engineers to explain that they are
bringing in Linux. But it is sometimes starting to happen that the
suits themselves tell their engineers, &ldquo;How about this Linux
solution?&rdquo;, even in areas where it might not make any sense at all.
So it's changing.</p><p>I agree that a lot of people are starting to realize that the
Linux way of doing things isn't that strange - even for a business.
I've been talking about &ldquo;openness&rdquo; to business when I'm going to
these private business talks, and almost uniformly, the businesses
say, &ldquo;That is what we are trying to do internally&rdquo;, that is, trying
to get rid of some of the fairly strict, hierarchal nature of the
company. There is this open-doors policy that just about any modern
company has in trying to make communications flow more reasonably
across different pieces of the organization instead of always going
through the channels. What Linux has done basically is exactly
that, except it has taken it to the ultimate extreme, which is
there is no outside to Linux - there is no external shell at all,
because everything is done basically with no real channels.
Everything is done by just letting information flow as freely as
you can. And it works - and it has worked very well so far.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: How many people are
involved right now in Linux development?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Well, how many people
in this room have written kernel code? About three or four. How
many people in this room have written code for anything that has
shown up on a Linux CD ever? So the point is that these sets were
completely separate, which is strange because the kernel coders
should have raised their hands for the second question. But the
point is, depending on the question, the answer is different. When
it comes to the kernel, a few hundred people have contributed
noticeable amounts. Of those, 10-50 have contributed major chunks
of code. But when you look at Linux as a system - and you really
should and it's not even just Linux at that point - obviously,
there are huge numbers of people. Part of being open is that it's
so hard to say where the boundaries are, because a lot of the tools
used under Linux are used on other operating systems too. Does that
hurt Linux - no. Does that hurt the others - no. It's quite the
reverse. Being open and not having a boundary between Linux and BSD
in many of the tool areas makes everybody stronger. That also makes
it very hard to count, whether it is 17,000 or 25,000 or something
else, who knows?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: I'd like to look at
this word &ldquo;open&rdquo; for a second because some of us have been around
UNIX for a long time, especially the promotional side of UNIX. I
mean, Sun for years talked about being open. Somebody from HP once
told me, there is nothing more closed than something that calls
itself an open system. In many ways because some of these things
just didn't get along; you'd compile them and they didn't agree.
Now, an interesting thing - I don't know how many of us are wearing
these badges with a promotion for a company called Real Names on
the top of them - these guys announced yesterday that they are
going open source, so we have a little promo going on right here.
Open source has become something that is very advantageous,
marketing-wise, to say about what you are doing. Sun just went open
source with Solaris, although I might characterize that as a kind
of share-cropping strategy, where you get to work on our crops as
long as we get to sell them. So, I'm not sure that is as attractive
as Linux. Then in many ways, the free software movement has sort of
morphed into the open movement. I would take it that &ldquo;open&rdquo;
literally means you can look at the code and then we go on from
there, is that true?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Well, first let me
talk about the political side. &ldquo;Open&rdquo; used to be a dirty word, then
a year and a half ago people started trying to find a new term for
what was called free software and open source was coined. A lot of
people thought that was a really bad name, because of the history
of misusing &ldquo;open&rdquo; as just a marketing term. To me open means
more than just being able to look at stuff. If you were just able
to look at it, it would not be open. A window is not open - sorry
about the confusion, I'm not talking about Microsoft - a window is
not open just because you can see through it. The definition of
open is that you can enter it and start playing with it and make
your own decisions. You don't have to ask for permission in order
to do stuff. I think that is the important part, the fact that
nobody controls what you do. Basically, all open licenses control
to some degree how you can close it again. There is a lot of
argument in that area where people disagree about how you can takes
parts of something open and try to close it off. But the important
part inall true open licenses is you can basically, at least for
your own use, do whatever you want and you can also talk to other
people about it and share your changes.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Would it be fair to
compare it to, say, a spoken language in that respect? New words
can show up, you can use them, you can contribute them?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: It certainly is a
language, but I don't think that analogy is very good. In fact I
don't know any good analogies. The usual one that people tend to
use is the hood of a car - you've all probably heard that one.
Where you say that open source is like having a hood that you can
open on your car so that you can tinker with your car. But most
people don't want to tinker with their cars, because, quite
frankly, they have more electronics than most large cities had 20
years ago. The point is that it's not that you want to tinker with
your car, it's that you can take it to the shop down the street and
let them tinker with your car - you don't have to take it back to
Ford or Toyota or whatever. That is still a bad analogy, but it is
the best one I've heard so far.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Let me try one that has
been kicking around a bit, and I will admit to pushing it a bit. As
a writer, I look at language and how people use it. It is
interesting to me that when we talk about software, we use these
construction metaphors: we build something called a site, we
develop, we design, we architect, there are all these building
metaphors. Inprise, formerly known as Borland, has just announced a
whole raft of Linux tools they are going to develop called
&ldquo;something Builder&rdquo;. This is interesting to me in the sense that I
think what we are seeing to some degree is the software business
turning from one we understand entirely in terms of its suppliers -
those suppliers like Microsoft and Lotus and others that make a
block of bits in a box. If you read the papers and magazines, you
read about this war between this supplier and that supplier, but
the truth is when it comes down to it, people build something, they
need - &ldquo;scratching an itch&rdquo; is an expression often used about why a
programmer does a kind of work. I'm wondering if that works for
you?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: I think that building
is correct. There is the analogy where you can choose to get a
standard house completely built for you: a house in which you don't
have any choice. But hey, you don't have to make any decisions, and
a lot of people want to avoid making decisions in life. Or you can
decide to customize your house, and when you customize your house,
maybe you buy one set of walls from one person and the roof from
another person. That's kind of where the Linux approach comes in -
that you have these building blocks to use to your own
satisfaction, and you can make a house that looks different. In the
end, it's cheaper; even if you buy blocks, you put them together in
a very similar way. There are no surprises - you know where the
closets are, and they are not in the attic. So when you go into a
friend's house, you may initially be confused as to where the
bathroom is, because you have made the choice of making something
that fits you better. That's very powerful, especially in
businesses, where you have practices that have been honed for tens
or hundreds of years and suddenly you bring in computers, and you
want to build the computers so that they fit your business
practices or your personal tastes or whatever, instead of having to
take this prefabricated thing you get from one vendor.</p><p>I think this is the future of software, simply because
software is so cheap to copy. Being cheap to copy means in the long
run there is not going to be much of a industry in doing standard
blocks. You are going to take the standard blocks for granted
whether they be an operating system, whether they be the windowing
system, or whatever. What will really drive the software industry
will be customized special software for special needs, and I think
that is where the software industry is going. Right now, we have
been in this strange situation in that the industry has been
changing so quickly, even the standard blocks, that right now when
we look at most software companies, where they actually make their
money is the standard blocks. I think that will go away, and what
people will make their money off of is the personalization. You see
the same thing on the Web. That's already happened to a large
degree. All the money used to be in the infrastructure in getting
it working at all. Now, people are interested in the
personalization - the portals - the ways for users to get their own
web interface. And that is where everybody is going. I think that
the Web has moved a lot faster than the software, partly because
software is complex; it's a complex area, I'm certainly not saying
people will change it in the next two years, but it will change in
the next ten.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: It is rather
interesting that the majority of the Web pages we see today are
served up by open-source software - by Apache often running on
Linux, Free BSD or one of the others. This is software that was
developed on this model - it wasn't developed on the block of bits
model.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Well, it's partly
because of the flexibility. Obviously, when you are doing web
stuff, especially three, four or five years ago, the whole market
was changing very rapidly and you needed the flexibility. You could
not go in many cases with a completely finished solution. In many
cases, a lot of the ISPs basically had to build up their own
solutions. That's where the prefabricated building blocks really
help. You can basically do whatever you want. Then what happens, is
that after a time, you reach a kind of stable platform, and the
building blocks are bigger. The building blocks that used to be
individual bricks are now these huge walls that you just put down
next to each other when you build a house. The same thing happens
in software. The building blocks five years ago used to be the OS
kernel and the compiler and whatever, and these days the building
blocks to a large degree are more of a combination of all these so
that now you have a building block that is a base system, windowing
or web serving, and you build your own house that way. So change is
happening in many ways, but the same fundamental building-block
analogy does hold true.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: I'd like to invite
people to come up now and form a line at the microphone.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Simon
Applebaum</b></span>: I'm Simon Applebaum, one of the senior
editors with Cablevision Magazine. Linus, the company you are a
part of, Transmeta, is run by Paul Allen, and Paul Allen runs
Charter Communications, a major cable operator. Has Paul Allen
approached you, or have you approached Paul, about using Linux as
an operating system for the cable industry through Charter's
digital set-top boxes? And if not, what role do you see Linux
playing in cable as a set-top box operating system?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Okay, first off, I
can't really talk about Transmeta. But I guess I can say this much
- no, it is not run by Paul Allen; it's run by Dave Ditsell. Paul
Allen happens to be one of the people or one of the venture
capitalists who put in some money. That's all of the connection
there is, really. As a result, no, I have not talked to Paul Allen
and he hasn't talked to me. I've talked to other people interested
in embedded systems. For some reason, within the last year or so,
the embedded market has sprung up as something really interesting.
It's not something I would be working on personally, but it's
something I've been getting in contact with through a lot of
different sources, and then set-top boxes have been the obvious
kind of high-end embedded system people are looking at. I don't
know how many of you know Tivo, the digital recorder, that's a kind
of set-top box running Linux, even though they don't actually
mention it in their ad.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Simon Applebaum</b></span>: By the way,
in a story we did a few weeks ago, we mention Tivo is running Linux
and Tivo is also going to be a cable player as well.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: The fact is, most of
these embedded people do not even really talk to me - and I
consider that a feature! When I'm talking openness, I really mean
it. It doesn't mean I want to control things. I want to be out of
the loop, especially on issues that aren't my specialty. And cable
TV is not my specialty! So, I get a lot of technical questions and
usually they are from people I can't talk about openly. And there
is a lot of interest in this area. But what will actually happen is
like with the Tivo: I will actually be told two months after the
announcement that, oh by the way, it's using Linux! So, I don't
know any more than you do.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Amy Wohl</b></span>: Hi, my name is
Amy, I am an industry analyst. I'd like to ask you a question about
the very interesting point of view you expressed about going to a
world in which software is built out of building blocks and is
therefore more custom rather than the kind of shrink wrap packages
we see today. That's almost a contrarian expression. Yesterday,
Larry Ellison in talking about Oracle said he wasn't going to allow
anyone to change even a single line of code in Oracle applications:
certainly, a strict point of view. Do you think when this
building-block approach begins to get implemented, it will be
through people actually doing coding or do you have in mind more of
a model in which people are able to put the blocks together the way
they do personalization on the Web today by making choices through
some sort of dialog interface?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: I think the coding
part is obviously very important - that's the part I've been
involved with. I think, in the long run, most of the customization
work is not going to be so much coding, as it is going to be
designing a system. For all I know, Larry Ellison might well be
right in that nobody is ever going to change Oracle. Because Oracle
will be just a small building block; I mean, it's considered large,
but if you actually think of it as a part of the whole
infrastructure at a company, it's a small part - it's important,
but it's still just a building block. You will see a lot of these
kinds of customization packages. You already see them. This is why
Visual Basic was so hugely successful - not because it was a good
medium for programming, because it's not. Don't get me wrong, I
like Visual Basic, really, and I think it is one of the best
successes Microsoft has had. That was because it was a really good
medium for customization, it was a great medium to the front ends
for the real work. I think that is the future.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Audience member</b></span>: I have a
bit of a different question. Mr. Torvalds, your home country is
Finland, which has been receiving a lot of press lately - Nokia's
success in giving wireless to the world, a major investment by a
Finnish telecom operator in Boystree recently, the highest Internet
penetration in the world, the highest cellular penetration in the
world. What is it about Finland?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Finland is an
absolutely great country, except for the weather! The weather
sucks. Everything else works really well. I think that one of the
issues with Finland, to just kind of bring it back on track with
Linux, is that it's a fairly small country and is very homogeneous.
It's kind of a building block. If you look at cell phones, it's
extremely hard to introduce cell phones in the U.S. because the
U.S. is a very, very complex economy, very diverse. There is a lot
of existing old infrastructure and it is way too expensive to
upgrade in one go. And this is kind of similar to Linux, where a
small and agile person, or a small and agile country can actually
do really well. In Finland, for some strange reason after World War
II, the technology side was emphasized very heavily, and because it
was small and easily accessible, it was very easy to
upgrade.</p><p>I moved from Helsinki to the Silicon Valley, and boy, Silicon
Valley is supposed to be the center of the universe when it comes
to technology, but it's a third-world country in many ways! A lot
of the infrastructure works so badly. Stuff like electronic banking
is electronic in name only; the banks actually send checks on paper
between themselves after you use your web browser to fill in the
information. That doesn't happen in Finland. When you push the send
button, it is on the other person's account - instantaneously. The
other reason, apart from these benefits of being a small, agile
country, is that the weather does suck - the winters are long and
dark, and there is nothing else to do.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Do we have any
technical questions?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Audience member</b></span>: Do you see
the knowing interface, the user interface, completely diverging
from the operating system, the underlying system?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: To some degree, yes.
The reason again is that in this situation you don't want to make
your systems too complex. The way to avoid complexity is by having
regularity and flexibility, so that people can pretty much mix and
match. One of the issues, for example, is that Linux or any
operating system is supposed to be usable on a lot of machines
where a windowing interface doesn't even make sense. This is
something that Microsoft has several times found out the hard way.
First with Windows 98, I noticed that it doesn't work that well on
servers. Then with Windows NT, I noticed it doesn't work that well
on most embedded applications. Putting the windowing interface into
Windows NT, a system where it doesn't make sense to have it, was
stupid. You don't want to have that type of coupling. I'm sorry for
picking on Microsoft, because others do the same stupid mistake
over and over again. It's just that some mistakes are more obvious.
So what you really want to do is decouple as much as possible,
because it gives the user the flexibility to use just one or the
other part but also, from a purely developmental standpoint, it
means you have a chance of actually understanding how the system
works technically. For example, if we tried to integrate the X
server into the kernel, or even worse, if we tried to then
integrate the windowing system, the end results would not be
pretty. There are UNIX vendors who have tried this and they've
always failed, so they've put in resources. The reason is simple:
you want to go for regularity and you want to go for
interchangeable parts.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Same audience member</b></span>: Then
as a followup, how would you feel about having a Microsoft Windows
lookalike skin or interface that would actually help you gain a
much bigger desktop space, which would have a much more reliable
underlying system?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: I would probably not
use it myself, but I certainly would not mind.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Same audience member</b></span>: Do you
know of any such projects going on?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Different audience member</b></span>:
Well, there are skins for Enlightenment that will allow you to do
that, as well as for Window Maker and I think FVWM95. They are all
very familiar to Windows users.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: There are interfaces
that make Linux applications look more like Windows applications.
If you want to go on a deeper level where you actually want Windows
programs to not know they are running on top of Linux, there are
solutions for that too. But you get into a much hairier
country.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>1st Audience member on this
topic</b></span>: It's just that the issue is the migration, a lot
of corporations - a lot of big companies - would love to switch
over to Linux, but the serious issue is retraining all those users
who do nothing but use a basic word processor.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Yes, for retraining
purposes, it's usually the windowing interests that seem to be
converging on something that looks similar to the Mac or Windows or
something like that, just because people are used to that, and what
people are used to, they like. For migration purposes, one of the
big issues is often that there are like one or two applications
that you want to run and that iswhere solutions like Soft PC have
come in.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Audience Member</b></span>: I think
that Microsoft's IE5 is technically a lot better than Netscape if
you just think about XML or however - how do you think Netscape or
an open-source group can catch up to Internet Explorer?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Well, I'm not going
to go into Netscape, but it does bring up a separate issue that
tends to come up over and over and over again which is that people
think open source automatically means that the end result is
better. That is not true. Open source means you have the potential
to take advantage of a much more scalable way of doing development.
The fact that you have the potential to do that does not mean that
you will, or even if you will that you will actually lead in the
right directions so that it succeeds. It is fairly obvious that
Netscape, as an example, did not get the interaction going between
the outside world and the Mozilla project itself. Which meant that,
yes, it became open source but to some degree, it never took off as
they hoped. The good news is that because people are now thinking
Mozilla didn't work, suddenly outside groups are feeling more
empowered. They think that okay, Mozilla failed, let's take the
Mozilla source now and make our own modifications. There seem to be
a lot more groups that are more interested in pushing the browser
issue. And Mozilla seems to be less arrogant as an organization.
So, I actually think that this situation may change. But right now,
this is an example of no, open source is not the panacea; the
answer to world hunger or whatever!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>same guy</b></span>: Yeah, but actually
the Internet is expanding. Everyone will be using the Internet in
some years. However, there are already some sites that are not
usable with Netscape that I have experienced. What are you doing so
that people can use the Internet with Linux too?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Me personally?
Nothing! I'm making sure that the PCP stack works fine! But that is
a slightly different level than Mozilla! What I feel is that people
are worried about playing catch up with changes. That's only true
as long as web content is actually dynamically changing all that
much. It's not anymore. Yes, right now, for example, IE5 shows some
pictures better, some sites show up the way the author intended for
them to be shown up. But the changes aren't that large. How many of
you use Netscape? How many of you have a problem? How many of you
blame the site? There are not that many real problems. And the
other thing is that yes, it actually is the site who loses the
customers. Which is not a problem because a lot of these IE5 only
sites are Microsoft-only sites. So, you look for your customers and
you go for your customer base. But if you look at anything that
even wants to be big and important, they make sure that their site
works with Netscape too.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>New question</b></span>: Microsoft has
been talking a lot about opening up their own code. Whether or not
they actually do that is a big question; but if they should do
that, what does it mean for Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: I'd like to start off
by saying talk is cheap, and I think this is a fairly theoretical
question. However, as a theoretical question, I'd be more than
happy to see more and more people open up their source. I'm not
convinced, for example, that the Sun community license is a very
good license. But it still makes me very happy to see that Sun is
opening up and making their knowledge available to others. And if
Microsoft were to open up, I'd be more than thrilled. I don't think
it is very likely, or if it does happen, it will more likely be in
niche markets. People think there is more of a Microsoft bigotry in
the Linux community than there really is. I'm more than happy to
use Microsoft products. It is just that I am selective about the
products I want to use. For example, I've always liked PowerPoint,
and I've always thought that Visual Basic was a good product. It's
just been hard to use them because I've always thought the
platforms they run on aren't good enough. I used to do my slides
with PowerPoint for the longest time with a Windows Installation
package. This is true, I find of all the developers I'm in contact
with, that maybe we take up Microsoft as a bad example in specific
areas, but we're not as anti-Microsoft as the press makes us
seem.</p><p><a name="footnote"></a>* &ldquo;Linux For Suits&rdquo; will also be the
