    Linux-based desktops or thin clients could spell
    lower total cost of ownership to a budget-cutting town CIO, and
    he's about to find out how much lower.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x233a580.0x2432240"></a></h2></div></div><p>There have been some major changes in the
City of Austin's IT department since last I visited with then CIO
Brownlee Bowmer. For one thing, Bowmer has transferred to a new
position with the City's Waste and Wastewater department. Next, one
of the first things his replacement did was to reorganize the
department. For another, the city is now very serious about finding
ways to cut costs.</p><p>As a result of all the above, the city's attitude towards the
use of Linux and open source software has taken a 180 degree turn.
When I first started tracking the City of Austin/Microsoft/Linux
saga two years ago, a deputy director in the IT department told me
that if he found Linux being used on a desktop he would have it
removed.</p><p>Not long after that conversation, the city signed an
Enterprise Agreement licensing deal with Microsoft. It seemed to
many, myself included, that even though they were chanting &ldquo;TCO,
TCO&rdquo; as they signed the deal, being cost effective was the last
thing on their mind. That's not the case today.</p><p>I recently had the opportunity to spend some quality phone
time with Pete Collins, the City's acting CIO. I'm impressed. Keep
in mind that I have dealt with IT management in state and municipal
governments for many years, both as a consultant and manager with
EDS and as a journalist. I've met some good folk and I've met some
that make Dilbert's PHB look sharp. I've never been more impressed
more quickly than I was with Collins.</p><p>I asked Collins how he ended up in Austin as the CIO. He took
me back a few years with his reply. He finished college after he
got out of the Air Force, where he had been a jet engine mechanic.
He said he learned self-discipline in the service. He studied
accounting at Dominican College in California and planned to become
a CPA. But in his last year of school, his dean approached him
about a new class being sponsored by Fireman's Fund. The class was
on COBOL. Only three people from the school would be allowed to
attend. He took a programming aptitude test and was selected as one
of three. That was his first experience with computers. In his own
words, &ldquo;It was better than a drug.&rdquo; It was at this point that I
began to suspect there might be a geek side to Collins.</p><p>Although he completed his degree in accounting, it was also
the end of his accounting career. He dove head-first into
computers. He worked with Unix back in the day, writing shell
scripts to automate data collection, learning C, even writing an
application called &ldquo;The Friendly Administrator&rdquo; to help AT&amp;T
3B2 customers manage their systems.</p><p>Any lingering doubts I had about Collins' geek side vanished
when he explained how he managed to compress a 750 meg database.
The database contained 21 pages of financial history for more than
5,000 firms. He needed it to fit on an 80 meg drive. He began by
trying the Huffman compression algorithm. It didn't squeeze tight
enough. It would take the air out of the text portion of the
database just fine, but numbers were more difficult and didn't
compress as well. One day when he was driving home, it came to him.
He converted the numbers to base-256 and voila, it worked and the
entire database now fit easily on the 80-meg drive.</p><p>There have been a lot of turns in the road for Collins'
career since then. Computer burnout led him to switch jobs and take
a position as a sheriff's deputy in California. In fact, when he
relocated to Texas it was to join the Austin police department.
While there he got involved again with computers and networking and
design. One thing led to another, and with his track record at the
city he was the logical choice to fill the role of acting CIO when
the need arose. The acting part of his title may very well
disappear in the next few months.</p><p>Of course, having a geek side doesn't equate to being a good
manager. As many have pointed out, and Collins freely admits, many
great geeks make horrible managers. Collins seems to have that rare
ability to balance the soul of a geek with managerial savvy.
Whereas a true geek might spend countless hours experimenting and
toying with the latest technology just for the sake of technology,
Collins wants to see results.</p><p>The first item on his agenda after assuming the post a couple
of months ago was to conduct one-on-one interviews with everyone in
the department. That's over 200 people. He told me &ldquo;I wanted to get
a pulse for the department. I wanted to see supervisors and
managers. I wanted to personalize it, to get to know them.&rdquo; He also
wanted to personally deliver a message to each and every one. The
message he gave them was &ldquo;I am customer oriented, and if our
customers don't want to do business with us, then we go out of
business. And I have no intention of going out of business.&rdquo;</p><p>It was during the one-on-one interviews that he heard a
number of people suggest that he take a look at Linux. They
described its benefits and how it could save the city dollars. He
listened, but when they asked that he look at it with an open mind,
he told them &ldquo;Save your breath. I'm already there.&rdquo;</p><p>Collins had already been thinking of a pilot for Linux, but
only for the department of public safety. Now, as CIO for the city,
he has the opportunity to do a pilot on a larger scale. And that is
exactly what he is doing. A project manager for the pilot will be
named in the next day or so. The length of the pilot and the
specifics of exactly what will be tested, and by whom, are not yet
set in stone. Collins hopes that what he calls a &ldquo;non-emotional
Linux pilot&rdquo; will allow the city to test and quantify what savings
can be achieved in a number of areas.</p><p>Collins said the pilot will include the use of Linux not only
as a server but for desktop usage as well. In fact, he is going to
be running Linux on his own desktop so that he has a good feel for
what his pilot customers are experiencing.</p><p>He is especially interested in seeing what sort of
performance and savings he can get out of running office
applications on a server with terminals as the desktop, ala the
Largo, Florida, solution reported by Robin Miller.</p><p>I asked Collins about the possibility of embedded Linux being
used in mobile computers like those in APD squad cars. He told me
that those devices are currently Windows-based, but that he has
asked Motorola, who makes them, about the possibility of using
Linux instead.</p><p>In closing, I asked a two questions about things with the
potential to cast dark shadows over the pilot: Microsoft and SCO.
Is he concerned about Microsoft trying to have him removed from
office for doing a Linux pilot? No. He has already met with
Microsoft. They know he wants to lower licensing costs, and they
know he will be doing a Linux pilot. Is he concerned about
<a href="http://sco.iwethey.org" target="_self">SCO</a>'s sword-rattling?
No, but like any competent IT manager he will be keeping an eye on
the situation.</p><p>Collins is not a Linux or an open source advocate. He does
not envision the day will come when the city runs exclusively on
Linux and open source. His vision of the future of IT at the City
of Austin is of a hybrid environment: using the right tool for the
right job without blind allegience to any platform. My bet is that
he is exactly the right guy to make that vision a reality.</p></div></div>
