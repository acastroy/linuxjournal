    Using Snort and a homemade read-only cable to follow network traffic
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf06580.0xffe298"></a></h2></div></div><p>When our home LAN graduated to a 24x7
Internet connection, my Linux box became the firewall and the
router. I liked the ability to customize the firewall, and by using
Snort I could keep an eye on the barbarians at the gates. However,
I could not experiment much without disrupting the entire
household's Internet access. Adding a DSL/cable broadband router
(see Resources) with a built-in firewall took my computer off the
critical path and allowed me to experiment with various
configurations and operating systems without domestic discord. But,
I missed seeing what was going on. I do not want the first sign of
someone attacking me to occur when they appear inside the
firewall.</p><p>Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are standard practice in
the corporate world, but they easily can cost more than an entire
home network, including computers. With some free software (Snort),
a cheap Ethernet hub and a custom cable, you can have an IDS that
is almost as good as a commercial system. The major lack is the
pretty reports and graphs necessary to justify a big salary.</p><p>A typical home LAN with a broadband router is shown
here:</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6985f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. LAN w/Broadband Router
</p></div></div><p>Most broadband routers include a multiport switch. A switch
sends packets to only the destination port. In contrast, a hub is a
simple repeater and sends each packet to all other ports. With a
switch, each computer sees only its own traffic, so computer A
cannot monitor attacks on the other computers. Figure 2 shows how
to use a hub to peer around the router and see all packets.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6985f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. LAN w/Broadband Router and Snort Cable
</p></div></div><p>Residential cable and DSL modems run at 1-2Mbps, so a single
speed 10Mbps Ethernet hub is fine. These can be found used,
reconditioned or dumped as obsolete for as little as $10 at
discount outlets.</p><p>A packet sniffer, such as Snort, running in promiscuous mode
on the second network interface card (NIC) of computer A can see
all traffic, including those packets blocked by the firewall. To
keep the second NIC from responding to any IP packets, it needs to
be brought up with no IP address, that is, <b  >ifconfig eth1
up</b>. If the second NIC already is assigned an IP address,
taking it down and bringing it back does not always delete the IP
address. Instead, take the interface down, remove the driver module
(<b  >rmmod ne2k-pci</b>) and bring it back up. If the
driver is compiled into the kernel, you probably have to reboot
here. Some system configuration tools, such as SuSE's yast, do not
let you configure an Ethernet interface without an IP address. In
this case, you have to edit the necessary files by hand.</p><p>No IP address usually is adequate stealthiness, but the
second NIC still can respond to low-level, layer 2 requests, such
as ARP requests. To make it totally invisible, use a read-only
cable. The wiring diagram is in Figure 3. These cables can be made
easily with a length of Cat5 cable, two RJ45 connectors and a
crimping tool. First, strip off a half inch of the outer
insulation, and insert each wire into a slot on the RJ45 connector
and crimp. There does not seem to be a consistent standard for
which pin gets which color wire, so eyeball a commercial cable and
follow its example. Label this the hub end.</p><p>Next, cut two inches off the other end of the cable to get a
bit of wire to make the jumper between pins 1 and 2 of the Snort
end. You can do this by bending it in half and shoving it in the
RJ45 connector. Again, strip a half inch off the outer insulation.
Strip a quarter inch of the inner insulation off the wires from
pins 1, 2, 3 and 6. With care and solid conductor Cat5 cable, you
can push the wires from pins 1 and 3 into the slot for pin 3 and
the wires for pins 2 and 6 into slot 6. Be sure all wires are
inserted fully into the slots, then crimp the end. See Resources
for links to pictures of the result. (A word of warning: trying
this with stranded wire is a task for masochists.)</p><p>If your cable is stranded or if you can't find a crimper and
are handy with a soldering iron, simply cut the patch cord in the
middle and connect the appropriate wires together. Use heat shrink
tubing to insulate and protect your handiwork.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6985f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Snort Read-Only Cable Wiring Diagram
</p></div></div><p>When you plug the cable into the NIC and hub, the status LEDs
should light in their usual pattern. If not, check and correct your
work. Next, put Snort in packet dumping mode with <b  >snort -d
-p -v -i eth1</b>. You now should see traffic coming from
both directions.
</p><p>Finally, edit snort.conf and start Snort in d&aelig;mon
mode:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

snort -D -i eth1 -p -c /etc/snort.conf
</pre><p>Most home broadband connections have dynamic IP addresses,
but they don't change often. Therefore, configuring HOME_NET in
snort.conf can be done by hand each time the address changes. An
alternative is to run the <span   class="bold"><b>whois</b></span>
program on your external IP address. It may tell you the IP address
range(s) owned by your ISP. Using this address/netmask for HOME_NET
makes for less work, but then Snort may ignore attacks from your
electronic neighbors because they are considered to be part of your
LAN.</p><p>With this setup, I again could see the script kiddies
rattling the door knobs and the various worms, including Slammer,
trying to propagate.</p><p>When I upgraded to Snort 1.9.1 and its more extensive attack
signatures, I started seeing a P2P GNUTella alert. I don't use P2P,
so this was suspicious. The router does network address translation
(NAT) between the internal private addresses and the single
external IP address, hiding the culprit. By moving the hub inside
the firewall, as shown in Figure 4, you can see the untranslated
internal addresses. You have to change HOME_NET in /etc/snort.conf
from the external IP address to the internal range, probably
something like 192.168.0.0/16, to do this.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6985f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Snorting Inside the LAN
</p></div></div><p>Before you move cables around, check whether your broadband
router supports configuring a spanning port to get all traffic,
that is, it is not switched. If so, you can leave the hub where it
is and plug Snort into the spanning port.</p><p>The culprits turned out to be AmphetaDesk (an RSS headline
aggregator) and PGP/GPG key fetches. The P2P GNUTella signature is
overly broad; it flags any HTTP GET request to a non-standard port
(not port 80). Below are some rules you can add to local.rules to
eliminate the false positives:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
pass tcp $HOME_NET any -&gt; $EXTERNAL_NET !80 (flow:to_server,established; \
  content:"User-Agent\: AmphetaDesk"; offset:10;)
pass tcp $HOME_NET any -&gt; $EXTERNAL_NET 11371 (flow:to_server,established; \
  content:"GET /pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search="; offset:0;)
</pre><p>In conclusion, Snort makes it easy to tell what's going on.
To stay on top of what's going on, update your Snort rules
frequently.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf06580.0xfff210"></a>Resources</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://www.unixreview.com/documents/s=7460/uni1032893910897/ur0209o.htm" target="_self">&ldquo;A
