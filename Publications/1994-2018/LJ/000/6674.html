Institute of Technology, Carlow, Ireland, is required to perform an
externally validated Programmatic Review every five years. In a
nutshell, the review is designed to examine the workings of the
department and their effectiveness, plus provide answers to
questions such as:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Are our courses industry relevant?</p></li><li><p>Are our courses up-to-date?</p></li><li><p>What do we do well?</p></li><li><p>What could we do better?</p></li></ul></div><p>The Department of Computing, Physics and Mathematics, of
which I'm a member, currently is working on such a review. The
biggest problem to date has been organizing meetings that involve
over 30 staff members. Due to timetabling constraints, not everyone
can attend every meeting without canceling classes. Short meetings
often turn into long debating sessions. And, of course, there's the
problem of having everyone sit in on a meeting that may cover
topics of no particular interest to them. What starts out as a
meeting to discuss assessment methods turns into a debate about
preferred programming languages or operating systems. Holding
large, department-wide gatherings has tended to be
counterproductive, and reaching consensus on important issues is
difficult, if not impossible. Of course, smaller &ldquo;everyone
interested in this topic&rdquo; meetings are common, and e-mail is used
to solicit opinion and ideas. However, no common mechanism exists
to collect and collate the various opinions being expressed or
decisions being made. On top of everything, we are struggling to
work under a strict deadline.</p><p>The crux of the problem was the synchronous nature of the
traditional department meeting was working against us. What our
particular environment needed was an asynchronous medium that would
allow staff to interact with one other when it suited them, to have
their opinions heard and&mdash;critically&mdash;recorded, and to provide a
focus for moving the Programmatic Review forward. This realization
lead me to Slash.</p><p>Most of you probably are already familiar with Slash. It is
the GPLed system that runs Slashdot, the global geek news site. I
rarely visit Slashdot, preferring to check Use Perl every day for
gossip about Perl. Both sites, as well as many others, use the
Slash system. My idea was to take Slash, install it locally and
then use it in support of the department's Programmatic Review
activities.</p><p>For the remainder of this article, I describe the process I
went through to get Slash working. As you'll see, it was not all
plain-sailing, and I made some mistakes along the way. In
documenting what I did, it is my hope that, should you find
yourself needing to install Slash, you can learn from my
experience.</p><p>There are seven steps to installing Slash.</p><p>Step 1: Install a Database Backend</p><p>Slash requires a database backend. At the present time, MySQL
is the best supported database technology (with support for
PostgreSQL under development). My target platform was an aging
Apple Macintosh G3 Server, running release 2.3 of YellowDogLinux, a
PowerPC distribution based on Red Hat. Prior to this, I'd never run
a database on this server, so my first order of business was to get
MySQL installed and configured. Luckily, the various MySQL RPMs
were already in place, so all I had to do was switch on the MySQL
d&aelig;mon with a few chkconfig commands (issued as root). These
commands installed and configured the appropriate MySQL startup
scripts into my boot sequence:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    chkconfig --add mysqld
    chkconfig mysqld on
</pre><p>The Slash documentation suggests adding two lines to the
script that executes MySQL, which is /usr/bin/safe_mysql on my
system. As root, I used vi to add these two lines to the start of
the file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    TZ=GMT
    export TZ
</pre><p>A quick reboot confirmed that MySQL was installed and
executing on the server. As this was the first time I'd executed
the MySQL server, I issued the following command at the Linux
prompt, setting the MySQL root password to one of my
choosing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    mysqladmin -u root password <span   class="emphasis"><em>'passwordhere'</em></span>
</pre><p>It is now possible to securely access the MySQL Monitor
command-line utility with the following command, providing the
correct password when prompted:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    mysql -u root -p
</pre><p>With MySQL ready, I used the Linux adduser command to create
a user, called slash, that would own the MySQL database used by
Slash. This may not have been necessary, but I did it in case I was
asked to identify an &ldquo;owner&rdquo; during the installation of the Slash
system.</p><p>From MySQL Monitor, I created a database for my Slash system,
as well as a MySQL user called slash, granting all privileges on
the newly created database to this user:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    mysql -u root -p
    mysql&gt;  create database PROGREVIEW;
    mysql&gt;  use mysql;
    mysql&gt;  grant all on PROGREVIEW.* to slash identified by '<span   class="emphasis"><em>passwordhere</em></span>';
    mysql&gt;  quit
</pre><p>Note that user slash is created within MySQL as a side-effect
of granting these privileges. By the way, the Slash documentation
recommends granting all privileges on the database. This may not
suit you (or your database administrator), so be sure to check the
Slash README/INSTALL documentation for the minimum set of database
privileges.</p><p>In working with and testing MySQL, I received some strange
authentication errors. I used MySQL Monitor to investigate and
noticed that the user table in the database had a number of rows
with empty user-ids. I deleted these rows from the table, and the
authentication errors went away. Here are the commands I
used:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    mysql -u root -p
    mysql&gt;  use mysql;
    mysql&gt;  select * from user;
    mysql&gt;  delete from user where User = '';
    mysql&gt;  quit
</pre><p>MySQL now was ready to go.</p><p>Step 2: Install Apache/mod_perl</p><p>Next up was the installation of Apache with support for
mod_perl. Again, my YellowDogLinux was not running either of these
services and, unlike MySQL, neither of them were in place. Rather
than download their source tarballs, I opted to download and
install the prebuilt and preconfigured binaries from the
YellowDogLinux FTP server. This process is automated by the apt-get
system, which should be familiar to Debian and SuSE users. Red Hat
users have a similar tool, called up2date.</p><p>The following commands (issued as root) downloaded, installed
and configured these services:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    apt-get install apache
    apt-get install mod_perl
    chkconfig --add httpd
    chkconfig httpd on
</pre><p>I then edited the Apache configuration file located at
/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf and uncommented the following lines to
enable mod_perl:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    &lt;IfModule mod_perl.c&gt;
        Alias /perl /var/www/perl
        &lt;Directory /var/www/perl&gt;
            SetHandler perl-script
            PerlHandler Apache::Registry
            Options +ExecCGI
        &lt;/Directory&gt;
    &lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre><p>Another quick reboot confirmed that Apache was running on the
system. I used a small Perl program from Chapter 4 of my book (see
Resources) to display the headers Apache returned:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    ./wwwb HEAD localhost /index.html
</pre><p>This step produced the following output:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Thu, 30 Jan 2003 10:29:53 GMT
    Server: Apache/1.3.27 (Unix)  (Yellow-Dog/Linux) mod_perl/1.24_01
    Last-Modified: Tue, 24 Dec 2002 07:46:41 GMT
    ETag: "11b5-933-3e0810e1"
    Accept-Ranges: bytes
    Content-Length: 2355
    Connection: close
    Content-Type: text/html
</pre><p>The Server: line of this output confirms that Apache is
running with version 1.24 of mod_perl enabled. I was not looking
forward to building Apache/mod_perl from source, and now it looked
it wouldn't be necessary. The Slash documentation did advise that
certain Apache/mod_perl setups don't work well with Slash, but I
decided to try, resigning myself to the fact that building
Apache/mod_perl from source would be necessary if I ran into
trouble.</p><p>Step 3: Install Perl</p><p>Slash, which is written entirely in Perl, recommends version
5.6.1 of the language. YellowDogLinux comes configured with the
5.6.0 release. To upgrade, I decided to let the CPAN module update
Perl for me, something it can do automatically. As root, I fired-up
the CPAN shell and asked the system to install the CPAN bundle.
This not only installed the latest CPAN module, but also
downloaded, compiled and installed release 5.8.0. of Perl:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    perl -MCPAN -e "shell"
    cpan&gt;  install Bundle::CPAN
    cpan&gt;  quit
</pre><p>If this is the first time you've used the CPAN shell, you
will be asked to provide some initialization settings. Provide
answers to the questions as posed. If something goes wrong or if
you make a mistake, press Ctrl-C to abort the initialization, then
issue this command to restart it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    cpan&gt;  o conf init
</pre><p>With the latest Perl in place, I reset the machine again
(just to be safe).</p><p>Step 4: Install Bundle::Slash</p><p>Slash requires the installation of 32 third-party Perl
modules. The Slash documentation warns that zlib and expat need to
be installed prior to the installation of some of the required
modules. I queried the RPM database to confirm this was indeed the
case:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    rpm -q zlib
    rpm -q expat
</pre><p>Refer to Resources at the end of this article for the zlib
and expat web sites, should these technologies not be installed on
your system.</p><p>Now, if you're a masochist with not much else to do, you can
install each of the required Perl modules by hand, downloading them
from your nearest CPAN. Alternatively, use the CPAN shell to
install the Bundle::Slash distribution, which does it all in one
go. This is what I did:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    perl -MCPAN -e "shell"
    cpan&gt;  install Bundle::Slash
    cpan&gt;  quit
</pre><p>I ended up babysitting this entire process, as the bundle
required me to respond to a number of prompts from various modules.
So you know, the download and installation process for all of these
modules takes quite a while. The most important piece of
information to remember while installing this bundle is the value
assigned to the virtual user name, because the DBIx::Password
module prompts for it. This value is required while installing the
Slash source code. Any alphanumeric string will do, and I choose
&ldquo;Programmatic&rdquo;. The DBIx::Password module installation also
prompted for details of my database and MySQL user name, and I
provided answers to the prompts based on the values I'd chosen
during Step 1. I was careful to check any messages displayed at the
end of the bundle installation. A small number of modules had
problems installing, so I had to install them by hand to resolve
the difficulties.</p><p>With the installation of this bundle complete, I was ready to
start installing the Slash source code.</p><p>Step 5: Install Slash</p><p>From
<a href="http://www.slashcode.com" target="_self">www.slashcode.com</a> I
downloaded the latest source code by accessing the Current Slash
quick link, which redirects to SourceForge. From this location, I
downloaded slash-2.2.6.tar.gz, then started the install with the
familiar set of commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    tar zxvf slash-2.2.6.tar.gz
    cd slash-2.2.6
    make
</pre><p>This produced an error: the Apache/ExtUtils.pm module could
not be found, and the <span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span>
aborted. This was not one of the 32 required Perl modules, so I
fired-up CPAN to fetch and install it, as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    perl -MCPAN -e "shell"
    cpan&gt;install Apache::ExtUtils
    cpan&gt;quit
</pre><p>To my complete surprise, this resulted in version 1.27 of
mod_perl being installed (in support of Apache::ExtUtils). I was
even more surprised when the installation asked me for the location
of my Apache source. The problem was I didn't have one, as I'd
installed Apache from its binary RPM file. In order to try and
continue, I opened up another console terminal, used lynx to surf
to the Apache web site and downloaded the 1.3.27 release. I
unpacked the tarball in a temporary directory, and then fed this
directory location to the mod_perl install. I crossed my
fingers.</p><p>I then was asked if I wanted to use this source to build
mod_perl. The default response was y, so I choose yes. I then was
asked if I wanted to build httpd from the same sources. The default
response was again y. I went ahead and choose yes, although, to be
honest, I was a little worried at this stage about what actually
was going happening.</p><p>After a relatively quick compile, the installation of the
module (and, I'm assuming, mod_perl and Apache) was complete. I
quit the CPAN shell and retried the
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> from the Slash source code
directory.</p><p>This time things went somewhat smoother, until the installer
tried to copy some files into a protected location, realized it was
not running as root and bombed out again. Of course, the Slash
README and INSTALL documents had told me to do everything as root.
So it was my own fault that this occurred, because I was logged in
under my regular user-id. I tried make again as root.</p><p>I got even further into the make but bombed out again, this
time because certain header files were missing. To my horror, upon
inspecting the generated error messages, it appeared that the
system was referencing Perl 5.6.0 and not the upgraded 5.8.0
release. Indeed, perl -v confirmed that release 5.6.0 was running.
I issued the whereis perl command and was told that Perl existed in
both /usr/bin/perl and /usr/local/bin/perl. The former was the
5.6.0 executable, and the latter was the executable for the 5.8.0
release. I could fix this by turning /usr/bin/perl into a link to
/usr/local/bin/perl. Having just installed a large collection of
Perl modules, though, I was unsure whether they had been installed
into release 5.6.0 or 5.8.0 of Perl, so I was concerned. I executed
the appropriate ln command, then ran make again.</p><p>To my relief, this time make appeared to work fine. I held my
breath and typed:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    make install
</pre><p>After a long series of messages, the &ldquo;Thanks for installing
Slash&rdquo; line appeared on screen. One final task was to add an
Include of the generated slash.conf file to the bottom of Apache's
httpd.conf file. I was almost done.</p><p>Step 6: Installing the Slash Site</p><p>The initialization of the Slash site is straightforward. I
entered these commands (note the use of the &ldquo;Programmatic&rdquo; virtual
user name from Step 4):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    cd /usr/local/slash
    bin/install-slashsite -u Programmatic
</pre><p>Unfortunately, this command failed, complaining that
DBIx::Password was not installed in the Perl 5.8.0 module paths. It
appeared the modules from Step 4 had been installed for Perl 5.6.0
and not 5.8.0, so I reran the commands from Step 4. As the CPAN
module had already downloaded all of the required modules for Perl
5.6.0 and stored them in its cache, they were all locally available
to 5.8.0 as a result. This sped things up considerably.</p><p>Unfortunately, after installing the modules into Perl 5.8.0,
my troubles still were not over. When I restarted Apache, the httpd
startup failed, displaying errors relating to missing Perl modules
in the 5.6.0 paths.</p><p>Then it struck me: the RPM binary for mod_perl was compiled
for use on YellowDogLinux, and YellowDogLinux assumes Perl 5.6.0 is
installed, as does the mod_perl RPM. Although I'd upgraded to Perl
5.8.0, mod_perl was still Perl 5.6.0. The true extent of the folly
of relying on RPM binaries was becoming clear to me.</p><p>I removed the Slash Include line from the httpd.conf file,
started Apache and checked which version of mod_perl was running.
It was still 1.24, even though as part of Step 5 it appeared that
version 1.27 of mod_perl has been built and installed. It had been,
of course, but not in the same directory structure as the older
Apache/mod_perl installation supported by YellowDogLinux.</p><p>I removed all trace of YellowDogLinux's Perl 5.6.0 from the
system with this command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    rpm -e --nodeps perl
</pre><p>then removed mod_perl as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    rpm -e mod_perl
</pre><p>This also removed the Apache executable from the system.
There was nothing for it: I'd have to backtrack to Step 2 and
install Apache/mod_perl from source. I went to the Apache web site
and downloaded the source for release 1.3.27, then popped over to
the mod_perl web site and downloaded the 1.27 release. I put these
files into my &ldquo;things to install&rdquo; directory, then issued the
following commands to install Apache/mod_perl:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

cd /home/barryp/toinstall
    tar zxvf apache_1.3.27.tar.gz
    tar zxvf mod_perl_1.27.tar.gz
    cd mod_perl_1.27
    perl Makefile.PL APACHE_SRC=../apache_1.3.27/             \
        DO_HTTPD=1 USE_APACI=1 PERL_MARK_WHERE=1              \
            EVERYTHING=1 APACHE_PREFIX=/usr/local/apache/
    make
    make test
    su
    make install
    Ctrl-D
</pre><p>To be safe, I re-ran the commands from Step 5, and everything
appeared to go well.</p><p>I was prompted for a number of values during the now
successful execution of the install-slashsite program. I identified
the hostname of the Slash server as well as the user and group
under which Slash would run (I opted to stick with the suggested
&ldquo;nobody&rdquo;). A list of plugins was displayed, and I was given the
chance to add/remove them from the list. I choose to keep the
default set of plugins. When asked if I wanted to install these
files as symlinks, I again went with the default response and
choose yes. For the site administrator username I entered
<b  >slash</b> and then provided an appropriate password
and valid e-mail address. The final message from the
install-slashsite program again suggested changes to be made to the
Apache httpd.conf file.</p><p>It was now time for the moment of truth.</p><p>Step 7: Give It a Whirl!</p><p>I stopped and started the httpd d&aelig;mon (restarting is
not enough) and then started the /etc/init.d/slash d&aelig;mon.
From another machine, I typed in the URL of my just-installed Slash
system. After a short pause, up popped my Slash site. From the
opening page I logged in as the slash user, clicking on the
backSlash hyperlink to access the administrator options. I was up
and running.</p><p>Although it is possible to start working with Slash right
away, I'd recommend reading the included Slashguide, which is found
in the Docs directory or by clicking Help from the main Slash menu.
There's enough in this document to get you started on the road to
changing the way your Slash site looks and operates. After that,
it's a case of advertising your site's existence and letting your
users at it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cb5580.0x1da5bd0"></a>Red Hat 8 Footnote</h2></div></div><p>I tested these instructions on Red Hat 8 and initially had
problems with the pre-installed Apache 2. When I downgraded to the
1.3.27 version of Apache/mod_perl, things worked perfectly. The
only downside was the resulting system was as slow as molasses.
This slowness had more to do with the fact that Red Hat 8 was
running on my two-year-old laptop, configured with 64MB of RAM
(well below the recommended minimum for Slash) than anything else.
On top of this, I tested the system from localhost using the
Mozilla browser, which did not help matters.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cb5580.0x1da5cd8"></a>Resources</h2></div></div><p>I could not have made it through the install and
