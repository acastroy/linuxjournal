    In part 3 of his series on Linux and the laptop, Jay explains
    how to get GNOME configured, sound modules working and its appearance
    changed.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10fe580.0x11f6240"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you followed my tutorial,
<a href="../000/6742.html" target="_self">&ldquo;Setting Up a Base Linux Install on a
Laptop&rdquo;</a>, you should have a base Linux install up and
running Window Maker, Debian's default window manager. Although
Window Maker is useful, I find the feature-rich environments of
GNOME and KDE to be more useful in a desktop/laptop configuration.
In this article I'm going to discuss how to further configure your
Debian laptop with GNOME 2.2 and enable sound using the basic
modules that come stock with the 2.4 kernel.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10fe580.0x11f63a0"></a>Installing GNOME 2.2</h2></div></div><p>Let us start by installing GNOME 2.2. There are multiple ways
to install it, but really only one way is viable for a Debian user.
All that you have to do is run <b  >apt-get install
gnome-core</b>. Debian's apt-get system goes out to the Sid
repositories listed in /etc/apt/source.list and downloads Debian's
latest build of GNOME and all of its many required packages. This
automation saves you tons of time. Although I have found a couple
of missing packages here and there, the convenience of an apt-get
install by far outweighs the downside of compiling it from source.
Using apt-get, the entire process takes a matter of minutes; if you
were to do a source compile from scratch it could take you hours.
For those of you who need to have the absolutely newest build of
GNOME, you're stuck with a source install. Fortunately, a utility
called Gargnome can assist you with a source compile. Although
Gargnome is no apt-get, it is a heck of a lot better then messing
with each individual package.</p><p>Once apt-get has finished installing GNOME, you need to
change the default window manager from Window Maker to Metacity. If
Metacity is not made the default default window manager, GNOME does
not work correctly; windows and menus pop up in funny spots and its
overall appearance is a mess. To change the default window manager
run <b  >update-alternatives --config
x-window-manager</b>. This lists all of the available window
managers available on your system and allows you to pick which one
should be the default. After you have made the selection, run
<b  >startx</b> and prepare for the amazement of what is
known as GNOME 2.2.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10fe580.0x11f6608"></a>Initial Sound Setup</h2></div></div><p>The first time GNOME 2.2 runs, you will receive errors about
xscreensaver being missing and /dev/sound/mixer not existing.
<b  >apt-get install xscreensaver</b> fixes the
screensaver error. The mixer popup occurs when you have yet to
configure sound support. Due to the wide variety of available
embedded chipsets, there is no way I can go through every variation
in this article. What I can do is go through configuring one of the
more popular sound chipsets, the i810. In my next article I'm going
to explain how to set up the Alsa modules, which offer a more
standardized configuration. If you don't want to wait, here's some
direction to get your sound cranking using the stock kernel
modules:</p><p>1. Compile the kernel with support for the i810 chipset.
Here's the settings to be made for the 2.4 kernel:</p><p>Sound card support</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Intel ICH (i8xx)</p></li><li><p>OSS sound modules
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>Verbose initialization</p></li><li><p>Persistent DMA buffers</p></li><li><p>Crystal CS4232 based (PnP) cards</p></li></ul></div>

</p></li></ul></div><p>2. After you recompile the kernel to incorporate the changes
made in the previous step, the sound-oriented modules are created.
We need to load two of them, i810_audio and ac97_codec. If you want
to load the modules by hand you could run <b  >insmod
$module_name</b>. Or, to have the system load them at boot
time, add them both to /etc/modules. In addition, for i810_audio to
load properly, ac97_codec must be loaded first.</p><p>3. Add the following lines to /etc/modules/aliases. This step
is dependent on your sound card; for the i810 you should add these
to the bottom of the file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        alias sound-slot-0                                 i810_audio
        alias sound-service-0-0                i810_audio
        alias sound-slot-2                           off
        alias sound-service-0-2                off
        alias sound-slot-3                           i810_audio
        alias sound-service-0-3                i810_audio
        alias sound-slot-4                           i810_audio
        alias sound-service-0-4                i810_audio
</pre><p>4. Run <b  >update-modules</b></p><p>5. Create a group called audio, and add to it all users that
are to implement sound. Make sure that /dev/dsp belongs to the
audio group as well.</p><p>If all went correctly, after a reboot you should have sound
in GNOME. A good way to test this is to try to play a music CD.
This will avoid any possible problems you may be having with ESD,
GNOME's sound d&aelig;mon. Which brings us to one of the problems I
found to be an outcome of apt-getting GNOME 2.2, in regards to
missing packages. Four multimedia related packages are missing:
esound, esound-clients, gnome-audio and gstreamer-plugins. If you
want to use your machine for any type of multimedia, you should
apt-get these packages yourself. This may not necessarily be a
problem with the install itself, because not all GNOME 2.2 users
are interested in sound. But, if you don't specifically know to
install them, it can be difficult to troubleshoot the cause of the
resulting problems.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10fe580.0x11f6ef8"></a>Scroll Mouse Fun</h2></div></div><p>Although trackpoints and touchpads are useful, there can be
times when the accuracy and swift abilities of a traditional mouse
can't be matched. If you plan on doing any graphics editing or game
playing on your laptop, you will be much better off if you have an
external mouse in your laptop bag. Typically your
trackpoint/touchpad is detected as a PS2 device, leaving USB ports
as the most convenient interface for an external mouse. The hardest
part of getting a USB mouse to work involves the kernel compile. In
my experience, USB modules can be finicky to make function
properly. I should add that before you start configuring a mouse,
you should get an idea if all of its features are supported by
Linux. For example, I know some of HP's and Compaq's rebranded
Logitech mice are not fully supported. With that said, here are the
USB options I had to set on my IBM Thinkpad R32:</p><p>Input core support</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Keyboard support</p></li><li><p>Mouse support</p></li><li><p>(1024) Horizontal screen resolution</p></li><li><p>(768) Vertical screen resolution</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Support for USB</b></span>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Preliminary USB device filesystem</p></li><li><p>UHCI Alternate Driver (JE) support</p></li><li><p>USB HIDBP Mouse (basic) support</p></li></ul></div>

</p><p>On a Dell Inspiron 8200, I set these options:</p><p>Input core support</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Keyboard support</p></li><li><p>Mouse support</p></li><li><p>(1600) Horizontal screen resolution</p></li><li><p>(1200) Vertical screen resolution</p></li></ul></div><p>Support for USB</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Preliminary USB device filesystem</p></li><li><p>UHCI Alternate Driver (JE) support</p></li><li><p>USB Human Interface Device (full HID)
support</p></li></ul></div><p>If everything is in check with your kernel support, you then
plug in the device. You should see a message similar to the
following in the console or through dmesg:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
hub.c: new USB device 00:1d.1-1, assigned address 3
input0:  USB Mouse on usb2:3.0
</pre><p>Upon unplugging the device you should see:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
usb.c: USB disconnect on device 00:1d.1-1 address 3
</pre><p>These messages can be misleading, though. For example, on my
Thinkpad I originally compiled the kernel using full HID support.
When I plugged in a device, all the appropriate messages were
displayed, but for some reason no input ever made it to my apps.
When I switched my HID support driver to USB HIDBP, everything
worked properly. So keep that in mind when reviewing the console
messages. They are your first line of attack when troubleshooting a
problem, but they are not the be all and end all of accurate USB
reporting.</p><p>If all went well, then your mouse should be detected properly
by the kernel. Which leads us to configuring X to see your external
mouse. If you have been following this tutorial from part 1, you
should be using X version 4.2.x, so my config snippets are from the
file /etc/X11/XF86Config-4. In this example I was able to get my
Razor Boomslang functioning perfectly. In your XF86Config-4 file,
you should see an entry for your existing PS2 interface. The entry
looks something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "Configured Mouse"
        Driver            "mouse"
        Option          "Device"                "/dev/psaux"
        Option          "Protocol"              "PS/2"
        Option          "Emulate3Buttons"       "true"
        Option          "ZAxisMapping"          "4 5"
EndSection
</pre><p>For my Boomslang I added the following entry below that for
my Configured Mouse:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "Boomslang"
        Driver            "mouse"
        Option          "Device"                "/dev/input/mice"
        Option          "Protocol"              "IMPS/2"
        Option          "ZAxisMapping"          "4 5"
EndSection
</pre><p>Some entries in the SeverLayout section also need to
manipulated; you need to edit one line and add another line. The
line to edit is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
InputDevice     "Configured Mouse"
</pre><p>You need to add CorePointer to the end of the line, so it
looks like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
InputDevice     "Configured Mouse"      "CorePointer"
</pre><p>This line sets your primary device to that of your Configured
Mouse, which should be the trackpoint/touchpad. So, no matter what
other interfaces are plugged in or not plugged in, the system
accepts input from that device.</p><p>Secondly, you need to add this line to the bottom of the
&ldquo;ServerLayout&rdquo; section:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
InputDevice     "Boomslang"             "SendCoreEvents"
</pre><p>This tells X to expect input from the Boomslang but not to
use it as the primary device. With this configuration you can use
your USB mouse and not have to worry about rebooting or changing
config files when switching back to the trackpoint/touchpad. The
transition between the two interfaces will be seamless.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10fe580.0x11eeb78"></a>Advanced Power Management</h2></div></div><p>Advanced power management (APM) is the primary link a user
has between his laptop and its power consumption. Due to APM's
integration in the Linux kernel, there is little difficulty to get
it running. All you need to do is compile your kernel with the APM
support enabled, and you will have basic APM functionality. You
must set the following options in the 2.4 kernel compile for
APM:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Power Management support</p></li><li><p>Advanced Power Management BIOS support</p></li></ul></div><p>At boot time APM reports as to what type of BIOS is detects.
After the machine is booted you can verify APM is functioning
correctly by running <b  >more /proc/apm</b>. If this
file does not exist, you have a problem.</p><p>Once APM is enabled, GNOME provides an extremely useful
battery monitoring applet that you can add to the control panel.
Right click on the panel, then go to Add to panel, then Utility and
then click on Battery Charge Monitor. This utility if perfect for
monitoring your battery; it tells you your power source and your
charge level. If you want to use sleep and suspend, you can use
this applet to kick it off. Due to the proprietary nature of
enabling those features, I am not going to delve into explaining
how to enable sleep and suspend. If you are looking to enable them,
however, you will find your needs met by consulting a howto manual
for setting up your exact laptop model. Such tutorials can be found
<a href="http://www.linux-laptop.net" target="_self">here</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10fe580.0x11eef98"></a>Fun with GDM</h2></div></div><p>By default the current build of Sid comes with XDM installed
for your X login needs. Although XDM was great in its day, it is
bare bones when compared to the newer versions of GDM. XDM is more
appropriate if you are running a server, whereas GDM offers more
desktop, or in our case laptop, oriented features. The ability to
shut off or restart the system is only one of GDM's many abilities.
In a server environment, shutting off a system without logging in
is a security nightmare. But, for a laptop this type of worry is
trivial. A few of GDM's other advantages are: it can be configured
on the fly without starting a window session; it has a lavish GUI
where you can configure many aspects of it's appearance; and it
enables you to manage multiple sessions. With GDM you even can
manage remote sessions.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Sid repository does not currently have the
latest version of GDM, 2.4; it offers the older, 2.2 version. In
regards to laptop use, the big difference between these two version
is the graphic greeter option. The graphical greeter provides a
much more customizable (XML) theme-oriented environment. If you
want to use GDM 2.4, you have to acquire it from an alternate
source. A tool like <a href="http://www.apt-get.org" target="_self">this
one</a> can be used to find alternative download sources for
GDM. After a source is found, you have a choice of apt-getting it
or downloading it directly from a site for a manual dpkg install. I
think you'll find the latter method to be faster than editing your
apt-sources and updating. I was able to download the
gdm_2.4.1.3-2_i386.deb package directly from
<a href="http://harshy.homelinux.org/files/debian" target="_self">this
site</a>, which I found through
<a href="http://www.apt-get.org" target="_self">www.apt-get.org</a>.</p><p>From the standpoint of the end user, the appearance of the
graphical greeter is big plus, and it's pretty simple to enable and
configure. When GDM is first installed, it defaults to using the
standard greeter. To change this click on the System drop-down menu
and select Configure. You will be asked to enter the system's root
password and then presented with GDM's configuration window. To
switch to graphical greeter mode, under the General tab, use the
drop-down menu next to Local: to select graphical greeter. To
configure it further, select the graphical greeter tab at the top
of the window. From here you can add new themes or switch between
existing ones.</p><p>To add a new theme, you must first download the .tar.gz file
of your preferred theme. Such themes can be acquired at many web
sites. A great place to start is
<a href="http://art.gnome.org" target="_self">art.gnome.org</a>. Once you
have downloaded the theme, you must go back into the configuration
menu for GDM and click on the Install new theme button under the
graphical greeter tab. This allows you to browse your system for a
downloaded theme; it also uncompresses the tar.gz theme and
installs it into the appropriate /usr/share/gdm/themes folder on
your system. If you are familiar with XML, you can go into that
folder manually and manipulate any theme. Each theme's primary
configuration file resides in the directory by the theme's name and
is named <span   class="emphasis"><em>$themename</em></span>.xml.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10fe580.0x11ef360"></a>GNOME's Appearance</h2></div></div><p>GNOME itself has many different aspects to alter in regard to
visual appeal. Although some users may find this a
far-from-critical area and not spend much time on it, it should not
be overlooked. With proper customization, a machine running GNOME
2.2 easily can rival any Windows box in terms of eye candy and
graphical convenience. There is an infinite number of different
ways to customize your GNOME workspace. The three basic things any
GNOME user can change without much hassle are the GTK+ 2.0 theme,
Metacity theme and the Nautilus theme. According to the GNOME theme
control panel, these three translate to controls, window border and
icons, respectively.</p><p>Installing new controls and window boarder themes is a simple
process. You can download new themes from many locations on the
Web. My old standby for GNOME-oriented themes is
<a href="http://art.gnome.org" target="_self">art.gnome.org</a>. Most
themes can be downloaded as a tar.gz file. You can install them
using the GNOME theme manager located in your Applications menu
through Desktop Preferences, Themes. Once in the theme manager, use
the Install Theme button to choose the theme element in question.
This installer uncompresses it and installs the new theme element
into the .themes directory underneath your home directory. Now, if
you restart your GNOME session, you should see an option for the
new theme element in the Themes panel.</p><p>A bug in GNOME 2.2.1 affects adding Nautilus themes with the
Theme control panel. New icon themes are supposed to be copied into
the .icons directory, but they actually are being copied to the
.themes directory. As a result, after you restart the session your
new icon theme is not available on the control panel. The fix for
this is pretty simple: link the .icons directory to .themes.</p><p><b  >ln -s ~/.themes ~/.icons</b></p><p>Another area of confusion is which themes should be
downloaded to change the icons. At the art.gnome.org site you need
to download the themes under the section Icon and not the themes
under the section Nautilus. The easiest way to tell if a theme will
work is, after you have installed it, look in its directory
(~/.icons/$themename) for a file called index.theme. If the
directory is missing index.theme, it's not going to work.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10fe580.0x11ef678"></a>A Bright Future</h2></div></div><p>The world of X GUIs has come a long way and is moving rapidly
to whatever it is destined to become. GUI versions a mere year old
seem outdated and uncomfortable when compared to what we have
today. I attribute much of this progression to the healthy
competition between Linux development and user communities. I don't
think GNOME would be where it is today without KDE, and vice versa.
Giving users a choice in their windowing environment is one of the
many freedoms the Linux user base has come to embrace. So pick your
GUI and enjoy!</p></div></div>
