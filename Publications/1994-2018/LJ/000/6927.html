    A new series about the state of open source in government&mdash;where
    it's happening, what it's used for, who's for it and who's against it.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2532580.0x262a240"></a></h2></div></div><p>People believe that governments have
embraced Linux and open-source software. You might see headlines
saying that Linux advocates have made serious inroads in
government. Logic dictates that Linux works well and the price is
right, so why not?</p><p>This year, Oregon and Texas legislators introduced house and
senate bills respectively supporting open-source software. Both
legislative bills made their way to committee hearings, but the
results differed significantly. Oregon's HB 2892 died. In Texas, SB
1579 found favor in the Committee and remains pending due to a
walkout by approximately 50 members of the House.</p><p>California and Oklahoma also made attempts do some
legislative mandating to use open-source software that died
quietly. Rhode Island didn't see legislative action, but it did
build a Linux portal for the state's rules and regulations
database, which received good reviews.</p><p>Other states, such as Alabama, attempted grass roots efforts
from their Information Service Departments to implement open-source
initiatives. Grass roots efforts exist in Iowa, Utah, Hawaii and
Louisiana.</p><p>We discovered open-source initiatives in city and county
government units across the country. Similar to commercial users of
Linux, the various local efforts have started at the bottom. One
city in a far northwestern state secretly deployed Linux to avoid
an entanglement with a local software company. In Texas, Houston
looks like a pioneer and has already seen reduced costs and saved
taxpayer money.</p><p>Depending on your worldview, we could say the Open Source
community made important strides or failed miserably in the past
year. Regardless, we gained extensive knowledge of our situation in
state and local government. This discussion covers specifics of our
overall findings.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2532580.0x262a500"></a>The Issues</h2></div></div><p>The main thing a government unit considering open-source
software wants to know is how it can save money. The people who
answer to their constituents need to show cost cutting and a
balanced budget.</p><p>A level below the legislators and government officials lays a
large, permanent bureaucracy. The managers spend time working on
technical issues such as reliability, continuity, security and
interoperability. At lower levels, people maintain the existing
systems with little funding for development. They need solutions
they can deploy with little effort that fit seamlessly into their
infrastructures.</p><p>Interested parties make up the final group with issues. These
include advocates and the opposition. Here, I depict the opposition
as well funded and organized. The advocates have little
organization, financial resources and/or participants.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2532580.0x262a6b8"></a>Saving Money</h2></div></div><p>During the Texas hearing, Senate sponsor John Carona summed
up the money situation nicely during the hearing before the
Administrative Committee. He addressed the lobbyists making up the
opposition and said:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Again, I don't understand why you all are so
threatened by this, but from a careful look at the lobbyists in
this room that are representing Microsoft, and all of you here
representing proprietary software companies which&mdash;let's face it,
that's where the big money is; it's not in open source, it's in
proprietary&mdash;it's rather transparent as to why you all feel so
threatened by this language. And I'll tell you, this [bill] is
innocuous, but next session I'll be on a crusade.</p></blockquote></div><p>Elected officials and state bureaucracies have little agility
in the area of information technology budgets. Meanwhile, lobbyists
and the popular press continue to say that open-source software
provides little, if any cost savings. Analysts, such as Andrew
Binstock of Pacific Data Works LLC, say governments are
conservative when it comes to new technology.</p><p>Rhode Island became the first state government to implement
open-source technology in view of the public. Jim Willis, the
special project consultant for the Secretary of State, chose
open-source software to implement an on-line rules and regulations
database. The implementation used LAMP, which stands for the Linux
operating system, Apache Web server, MySQL database and any of
three development languages&mdash;PHP, Perl or Python.</p><p>The state developed the database-driven portal for $40,000.
Hardware costs amounted to $6,000. Deployment cost $3,000, and the
remaining funds went for overhead and one consultant working only
two days a week for four months. The portal runs under Red Hat
Linux 7.2 and sits on a Dell PowerEdge server that came with a
MySQL database pre-installed. Ninety-five agencies use the portal
to submit PDF files with information on rules and regulations to
the Secretary of State's office. The database currently holds
approximately 1,700 regulations.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2532580.0x262a978"></a>The Political Opposition</h2></div></div><p>Oregon became the first state government to see a bill
progress to a legislative committee. Rep. Phil Barnhart submitted
HB 2892 on March 5, 2003, which required the state government to
consider using open-source software when acquiring new
software.</p><p>The Oregon hearing gave open-source proponents in other
states an opportunity to grasp the opposition's strategy. Their
strategy began with attempts to convince a state committee that an
open-source bill provides preferential legislation. They assert
that such legislation tilts the playing field.</p><p>This theme persisted in both Oregon and Texas. Each opponent
asserted the playing field was level and open-source legislation
would introduce unfairness into the procurement process. They
asserted &ldquo;no law exists to prevent the state from acquiring
open-source software now&rdquo; and no law is needed to enable them to do
so.</p><p>In the Oregon hearing the proponents testified first,
followed by the opposition. In Texas, the proponents and opposition
rotated. The Oregon sponsors, led by Ken Barber, did not have the
opportunity to rebut the opposition. The Oregon sponsors felt they
were at a disadvantage not knowing how the opposition would
testify.</p><p>In Oregon, three industry groups and the state's Department
of Information Services testified against the bill. The industry
groups included the Business Software Alliance, Initiative for
Software Choice and American Electronics Association (AeA), a
powerful high-tech lobbyist group that testified for only one of
its members. In Texas, the same people came to play, as did the
Association for Competitive Technology and Intel.</p><p>One might ask, &ldquo;Who are these lobbyists?&rdquo;, so let's take a
closer look. The first four suggest they represent software
companies. The last opposition party manufactures chips and
software for Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2532580.0x262ac38"></a>Business Software Alliance</h2></div></div><p>Better known as the BSA, this firm is the most formidable
opponent of open-source software of which I know. BSA employs many
former members of Preston, Gates &amp; Ellis (PG&amp;E), a practice
specializing in intellectual property law. Many registered
lobbyists in Washington DC work for PG&amp;E and represent
Microsoft and the BSA.</p><p>In reviewing registered lobbyists in Washington DC, we found
employees of PG&amp;E and BSA practicing in the area. They refer to
themselves as the foremost organization dedicated to promoting a
safe and legal on-line world. BSA also claims to be the voice of
the world's commercial software industry before governments and the
global market. The BSA employs highly dedicated and capable people.
They believe in their cause and have a track record for getting the
job done. Consider BSA to be of the highest professional caliber
and experts in copyright law.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2532580.0x262ad98"></a>Initiative for Software Choice &amp;
CompTIA</h2></div></div><p>In August 2002, Microsoft became a member of the Initiative
for Software Choice. The ISC has close associations with the
Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) based in
Washington DC. The ISC supports four principles: software should be
procured on its merits, the promotion of government funded
research, the promotion of interoperability through
platform-neutral standards and the maintenance of strong
intellectual property protections.</p><p>In August 2002, the organization reported it opposed
legislation in four countries&mdash;Israel, Portugal, Colombia and the
Ukraine&mdash;that require the use of open-source software in state
institutions. I guess they read that Texas was once a country and
decided to show up at the hearing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2532580.0x262aef8"></a>American Electronics Association</h2></div></div><p>Sixty-year-old AeA primarily involves itself in Government
affairs. This group has a large membership and maintains
significant clout in Congress and in state and local governments.
It contends that it influences federal legislation and regulations.
AeA tracks state legislation and regulations with a direct bottom
line impact in 14 states. Ken Barber wrote that AeA ultimately
killed the Oregon bill and maintains a significant influence on the
Oregon Speaker of the House. We also read that in Oregon, AeA
represented only one of its members.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2532580.0x262b000"></a>Association for Competitive Technology</h2></div></div><p>Founded in 1998, ACT represents industry members in computer
software, hardware, consulting and the Internet. ACT says it
prefers market-driven solutions over regulated ones, so it targets
any attempt at government involvement. ACT holds an opposition to
any law that would favor any software, regardless of the
reasons.</p><p>ACT officially states that market forces drive the success of
the IT industry. It also officially states that government
intervention is uninformed. I believe it means to say that
government officials who intervene in market forces are uninformed.
ACT believes governments threaten to stifle innovation and
competition. Perhaps it forgot to include economics 101 in its
curriculum in college or missed the part about monopolies and free
trade.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2532580.0x262b160"></a>Intel</h2></div></div><p>Someone needs to tell the executives at Intel that an
employee representing the company showed up at the Texas committee
hearing for the opposition.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2532580.0x262b268"></a>Year-to-Date Outcomes</h2></div></div><p>In Oregon, Speaker of the House Karen Minnis ordered HB 2892
killed. Reps. Barnhart and Wirth have attempted to resuscitate
Oregon's open-source software bill with little success. Perhaps the
irony of the Oregon situation lies in the fact that Linux is in
widespread use in Oregon public school systems and in local
government units.</p><p>Come to think of it, maybe the people at ACT found an acorn
after all.</p><p>In Texas, time did not allow committee members to send SB
1579 to the House. Unlike Oregon, the Senate enjoys the support of
the Texas Department of Information Resources (DIR). In fact, DIR
presented an open-source software recommendation to all agencies in
Standards Review and Recommendation Publication, SRRPUB09-OSS. The
recommendation states:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>many of the applications used in government could
be obtained and improved using the open source&mdash;this should support
purchasing best value solutions and removing the reliance on an
individual information technology vendor.</p></blockquote></div><p>In subsequent parts of this series, we will look at
individual cases where open-source software such as Linux
works.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom Adelstein</b></span> works as a
