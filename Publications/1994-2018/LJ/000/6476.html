from the usual rough edges of every .0 version, Red Hat 8.0
generated a lot of heat. Much of it came from the Bluecurve desktop
and from the changes RH made to standard KDE (for those who care, a
good, though partial, summary of what Red Hat actually did
<a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=kde-cafe&amp;m=103029445131343&amp;w=2" target="_self">is
available here</a>).</p><p>Red Hat had
<a href="http://people.redhat.com/otaylor/rh-desktop.html" target="_self">good
reasons</a> to create such an interface, apart from the
unavoidable implementation errors. Even before the release,
however, KDE developer Bernhard &ldquo;Bero&rdquo; Rosenkraenzer left Red Hat,
claiming that KDE, as shipped in that distribution, is crippled.
Since it's release, many GNOME and KDE fans are screaming because
of this unrecognizable, offending, hybrid GUI. An excerpt from
<a href="https://listman.redhat.com/pipermail/psyche-list/2002-October/001291.html" target="_self">this
posting</a> sums up their feelings pretty well:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>What you see is neither Gnome nor KDE in RH 8!
Kind of comical actually.... I think...Redhat did [us] all a huge
disservice with RH 8.</p></blockquote></div><p>Personally, I am happy Red Hat melted the two environments
together. If nothing else, this could be an excellent opportunity
to realize that decently functional, good-looking desktop
interfaces can be built on the assumption that KDE and GNOME
themselves aren't really necessary and important in the first
place.</p><p>In the rest of this article, I'll refer to them simply as
K/G.</p><p>Back in 1996 and 1997, as a free desktop user I missed a few
basic things&mdash;I'm still missing them today.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Making the cut-and-paste option always work between
windows.</p></li><li><p>System-wide Unicode, instead of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> different solutions for the Euro
symbol.</p></li><li><p>One standard, centralized, font management system,
for both display and printing.</p></li><li><p>A method for easy definition of the same hot keys
across different applications.</p></li><li><p>Documentation written for end users, not people
debugging a program.</p></li></ul></div><p>Of course, K/G have slowly added come of these options. But I
can't help but ask myself if these changes happened by mistake,
while they were doing something sillier and (at least initially)
throwing performances out the window (pun intended).</p><p>I would have liked to see, and here comes the real issue,
programmers working to provide a path along which all
<span   class="emphasis"><em>existing</em></span> applications could
<span   class="emphasis"><em>independently</em></span> evolve in such a way that
programmers could work less and end users could choose
<span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> combination of programs that maintain
performance, integration and the userspace features listed
above.</p><p>Instead, what K/G have said and done [during their
development] sounds an awful lot like &ldquo;let's throw existing
applications away, even when they are perfectly good, and make
everybody start using <span   class="emphasis"><em>our</em></span> programs&rdquo;. One
world, one Net, one (set of) windows&mdash;it's d&eacute;j&agrave;
vu.</p><p>I agree that without K/G Linux screenshots look like a mix of
many different things&mdash;things that don't really want to stay close
to each other. This point is made in
<a href="https://listman.redhat.com/pipermail/valhalla-list/2002-September/018193.html" target="_self">this
message</a> and expanded in the related thread.</p><p>Beginners may indeed have an easier time if, for instance,
the File Open dialog and other components were always the same in
any application. In spite of this, however, I keep thinking that
the whole &ldquo;one look and feel&rdquo; mantra is seriously overrated. I
further believe that advancing toward desktop integration starting
from the windows is the wrong way to go.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2800580.0x28f8df0"></a>Best of Breed Applications</h2></div></div><p>First of all, free software is successful because it started
doing the &ldquo;best of breed&rdquo; thing decades before consultants created
the slogan so they could overprice enterprise-level,
process-oriented, Dilbert-R-Us, business &ldquo;solutions&rdquo;. Now some
KDE-centric distributions are proposing that Mozilla be the
standard default browser. Good, keep going: I might not personally
agree, but I like open, pragmatic minds.</p><p>KOffice is trying to become a free FrameMaker with fully
integrated spreadsheet and presentation capabilities. Being the
ultimate solution to my idea of desktop/WYSIWIG publishing is why
I'd use it, side by side with mutt and The GIMP&mdash;not because it
browses local folders looking just like Konqueror.</p><p>What about developing effort? Mike Harris
<a href="https://listman.redhat.com/pipermail/psyche-list/2002-November/005552.html" target="_self">recently
pointed out</a> the huge amount of energy Red Hat is still
forced to spend to make OpenOffice, K/G, Mozilla, X and fonts
coexist, and I can't see why other distributions should be
different in these respects. Speaking of fonts in general, Mike
helps us understand why complaining about Bluecurve themes, in and
by itself, is pointless:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The GNOME and KDE releases in Red Hat Linux 8.0,
both are using Keith Packard's Xft2 and fontconfig, both of which
are a core part of XFree86 now, and will be _the_ way fonts are
done from now on period, in _all_ Linux distributions that are
using X at all.
</p><p>Keith has done a fantastic job at creating this technology,
and we are very glad to be using it in Red Hat Linux 8.0, and to
take X11 out of the 1980's finally.</p></blockquote></div><p>For years I have made it a point not to lose sleep over any
K/G, and now Bluecurve, crusade, on the assumption that the only
meaningful road to really useful and flexible desktop integration
is what I call a &ldquo;path&rdquo; above. A few weeks ago, I found the same
concept in
<a href="https://listman.redhat.com/pipermail/valhalla-list/2002-September/018231.html" target="_self">a
message by Havoc Pennington</a>. As he clearly expressed the
idea in software engineering terms, and because it makes me really
happy to see real gurus agree with the actual needs of the poor
users, I'll quote Havoc directly:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Interactions between applications and the runtime
environment really need to take place via documented,
toolkit-independent protocols and file formats.... Documented,
long-term-supportable protocols are the way to go from an
engineering standpoint, vs. more ad hoc and
implementation-dependent solutions.</p></blockquote></div><p>The last and more important reason to stop bothering with
K/G, Bluecurve and what-not is what I call the &ldquo;migration mistake&rdquo;.
Please let's end this desktop environment tantrum and realize how
futile it is to think Windows users will be freed from slavery by
somebody saying, &ldquo;Here, take this, it looks and feels just like
Windows.&rdquo; This last point has been thrown around too much, in too
many places.</p><p>The question &ldquo;How do I replace Microsoft Access&rdquo; appears on
the mail OpenOffice.org list every other week. Every time it
reappears a bunch of solutions, usually MySQL-based, are kindly
suggested. Almost always, though, nobody&mdash;starting from the
original poster&mdash;understands what is really being asked. They're
not looking for a &ldquo;a stable, powerful and license-free DBMS which
also has more or less the same buttons as Access&rdquo; as much as they
are looking for &ldquo;whatever, even text-based, as long as it reads
perfectly ten years worth of customer orders&rdquo;.</p><p>Windows users (especially corporate ones) don't stick with
Windows because they can't stand different interfaces, but because
they have a really hard time converting terabytes of documents in
proprietary formats. This is the real problem.</p><p>With respect to those Microsoft users not chained by data
compatibility but only by mouse and start panel addiction, give
them (and yourselves) a break. They couldn't care less about K/G.
They want to see windows, any windows, so they can point-and-click
all the way through. Everything that helps them to leave closed
platforms and formats is fine. After the first thirty minutes, they
won't even notice if their fingers are single- or double-clicking.
