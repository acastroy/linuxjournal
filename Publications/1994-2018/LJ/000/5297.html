    Do you wanna dance? Considering what we are going to talk about today, this seems like a good title, but the music in the background isn't exactly dance music (although Gordon Lightfoot does rock, kids). Oops!

Nevertheless, this kind of rambling at the beginning of a technical column can only mean that you have found the SysAdmin's Corner at <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s web site with your faithful host, me (Marcel Gagn&eacute;). Welcome back, everyone. Nice to see your smiling faces here at the corner where we discuss all things (techie &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Linux).
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcea580.0xde2190"></a></h2></div></div><p>So, if you've been following the last
four articles in this series, you've now got your NFS running, an
NIS server and some clients going, and all those shares are
mounting and unmounting automatically because of your new old
friend, the Linux <span   class="bold"><b>automounter</b></span>.
Life couldn't be better. Until . . . that guy in marketing decides
he wants you to back up his department's PCs and, since they are
all running out of space (those Flash games take up a lot of
space), he would like you to set up an NT server on the network to
do both of these things. You are at a loss for words, and your
blood pressure is on the rise. Install NT? Never!</p><p>Luckily, you run Linux and providing file space to Windows
clients is nothing a little dance won't fix. No, not on his head.
I'm talking a little <span   class="bold"><b>Samba</b></span>, the
Linux/UNIX file and print services program for that other OS. Heck,
why don't you let those marketing types share the printers as well?
They won't appreciate it, but you'll get a great deal of
satisfaction from it &lt;insert appropriate smiley here&gt;. For
those of you who are sitting at home with a Windows 95 workstation
or two sitting alongside your Linux server, this is also for
you.</p><p>Samba was originally developed by Andrew Trigdell in the land
down under. Using the SMB (server message block) protocol, Samba
makes it possible to share resources between a surprisingly wide
variety of operating systems. SMB, like many networking protocols,
does continue to evolve as developers do what developers do.
Consequently, the current version (or incarnation, if you prefer)
of the SMB protocol is actually called CIFS, for common Internet
file system. Hey, I don't make this stuff up. In case you are
wondering where NetBIOS fits into this picture, that's what SMB
evolved from, although NetBIOS isn't a protocol so much as an API
(application programming interface) designed to provide the
building blocks for creating LAN software. To keep as much brevity
as I am capable of, I won't go back any further than that.</p><p>Now, despite my jokes about Windows and the marketing guy,
Samba can provide file sharing services between Windows 95/98/NT,
OS/2, VMS, AIX, HPUX, Linux (of course) and many others. While most
people tend to think of Samba as the means by which we replace NT
servers with Linux machines, Samba is much more flexible than that.
For instance, the lone Windows PC in the office here has the Client
for Microsoft Networks loaded so that it can share files in the
&ldquo;Network Neighborhood&rdquo;. If you remember my example from the
<a href="../000/5298.html" target="_self">last article</a>, I had the PC's C
drive not only shared, but automounted. Here's a refresher.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    # Windows PCs
     natika_c           -fstype=smb,username=natika,password=secret         ://speedy/natika_c
</pre><p>I can also mount that drive like this.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
     mount -t smbfs -o username=natika,password=secret //speedy/natika_c /mnt/natika
</pre><p>Oh! Susan Aglukark is singing now and that's danceable.
</p><p>If I had a Samba share defined on my Linux server, I could
mount it from another Linux server as though I were mounting a
Windows share. I've got a small notebook (called wiltravl) running
Linux. On a somewhat larger server (called testsys), I've got Samba
running. It has a share defined called winstuff. With NFS, I would
specify NFS as the file system type with the <b  >-t</b>
flag, pass the appropriate options and tell it about the directory
we were mounting to.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
      # mount -t smbfs -o username=marcel,password=itsasecret //testsys/winstuff /mnt/winstuff
</pre><p>That command, by the way, is all on one line. Now, if I do a
<span   class="bold"><b>df</b></span>, I will see the file system
mounted as one of my local drives.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
     [root@wiltravl /root]# df
     Filesystem           1k-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
     /dev/hda1              1517920   1405640     35172  98% /
     /dev/hda5              2514172   1737840    648620  73% /data1
     //testsys/winstuff      6109952   4611072   1498880  75% /mnt/winstuff
</pre><p>Pretty cool stuff. With Samba, I can also make printers
available to the Windows machines on the network. Nothing stops me
from being able to use Samba exported printers from Linux either.
If you wanted to, you could even use Samba as your file sharing
system across your network, replacing NFS if the mood takes you
(we'll talk about that later). It's a kind of magic (noticing a
musical theme in the column yet?).</p><p>Anyhow, in order to make this magic happen, we need to get
Samba up and running. Just about every Linux distribution CD-ROM
comes with a version of Samba which tends to make installation
fairly simple by using RPM or <span   class="bold"><b>dpkg</b></span>
depending on your distribution. You Debian users can of course, use
<span   class="bold"><b>apt-get</b></span> to pull in the latest
distribution from the Debian site. But if you really want the
latest and greatest, then you need to get yourself to the
<a href="http://www.samba.org" target="_self">Samba web site</a>.</p><p>Go to the download section. The latest source is always
called samba-latest.tar.gz. If you prefer, you can also find recent
binaries for a variety of platforms, but they won't necessarily be
as up to date as the source files. To build and install Samba from
source, unpack the tarball into a temporary directory and follow
these steps.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
     tar -xzvf samba-latest.tar.gz
</pre><p>This will create a directory suffixed with the current
release number of the Samba source.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
     cd samba-2.0.7
     more README
     cd source
     ./configure
     make
     make install
</pre><p>By default, Samba will install in the /usr/local/samba
directory. If you would prefer to have it install in another
directory structure, then you can use the
<b  >--prefix=/path/to_dir</b> flag when you do the
<b  >./configure</b> step. After the installation has
completed (assuming that you accepted the defaults), we need to
create a Samba configuration file which will live in
<b  >/usr/local/samba/lib</b>. The easiest way to do this
is to copy the sample file provided along with the source into the
appropriate directory.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
     cd /tmp_install_dir/samba-2.0.7/examples
     cp smb.conf.default /usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf
</pre><p>There's a new song starting on the CD I'm listening to. It's
Diana Krall...that slow jazzy sound isn't quite a Samba, but it
doesn't matter.</p><p>Using your favorite editor (yes, mine is
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span>), open the smb.conf file and
change these two parameters : one is called &ldquo;workgroup = &rdquo; and the
other is &ldquo;server string = &rdquo;. For the workgroup parameter, I called
mine &ldquo;ROCKGROUP&rdquo; with a server name of &ldquo;Marcel's Musical Samba
Server&rdquo;. Now, let's start the Samba d&aelig;mons.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
     # /usr/local/samba/bin/smbd -D
     # /usr/local/samba/bin/nmbd -D
</pre><p>You'll want to add this to your startup scripts in rc.local.
(If you are looking for some details on how to do this, I've
covered this in <a href="../000/5309.html" target="_self">a past article</a>.)
Say that your server is called &ldquo;myserver&rdquo;. To test Samba and see
whether you have done everything right, type the following
command.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
     /usr/local/samba/bin/smbclient -L myserver
</pre><p>If everything worked smoothly, you should see something like
this appear on your screen.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p>I always wanted my own rock group. Speaking of magic, did you
notice? Without doing anything other than starting Samba with a
valid configuration file, my printers are available as resources on
the network. It is not necessary to define each printer
individually, Samba takes for granted they are shared resources
(you are running a server after all).</p><p>And so, once again, I must wrap it up for another week. This
is another one of those <span   class="bold"><b>BIG</b></span> topics
and I sure won't be able to cover it all in one column. Before I
go...I don't do this every week, I realize, but I want to thank
everyone who writes me, comments and otherwise contributes
suggestions or ideas to this series. You know who you are and I
appreciate your input. And now, your humble geek and narrator must
sign off (to the sound of the Barenaked Ladies). Until next we meet
on this, the

corner in the whole of the world wide
web<span   class="bold"><b>&lt;/exaggeration&gt;</b></span>, remember
