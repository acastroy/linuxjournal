    Linux may become the official operating system of the People's Republic of China.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1df2580.0x1eea240"></a></h2></div></div><p>When <i  >Linux Journal</i>
publisher Phil Hughes said in an interview with <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Seattle Times</em></span> that the Linux operating system in
specific, and the Open Source community in general, were the first
working implementation of communism in modern times, more than a
few Linux enthusiasts howled with outrage.</p><p>But with the People's Republic of China itself expressing
enthusiasm over the &ldquo;community ethos&rdquo; of the Open Source movement,
perhaps the link between Linux and socialism is not as far-fetched
as some would prefer.</p><p><a href="http://www.graphon.com" target="_self">GraphOn
Corporation</a> (NASDAQ: GOJO), developers of thin,
server-based software that facilitates the use of a variety of
applications over a network, has signed a &ldquo;memorandum of
understanding&rdquo; with the China-based Minmetals Townlord Information
Technology, Inc. that will put GraphOn Bridges software into
universities and military institutions around China. GraphOn
Bridges software is highly scalable and can deliver server-based
Linux, UNIX and Windows applications over local area networks, the
Internet, or through dial-up connections directly to the
server&mdash;all without altering the application's code itself. GraphOn
Bridges includes both UNIXBridge and LinuxBridge. A similar product
for Windows applications, called WinBridge, is also being
added.</p><p>Said Walt Keller, CEO and President of GraphOn, &ldquo;The
flexibility and scalability of our software gives the Chinese ...
the greatest latitude in selecting the software and hardware
options that best suit their diverse needs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Community ethos&rdquo; notwithstanding, the &ldquo;diverse needs&rdquo; in
China tend to revolve around dealing with the country's huge stock
of aging PCs and the persistent problem of getting the newest
Windows software to work on increasingly obsolete hardware in
China.</p><p>GraphOn's partner, Minmetals Townlord Information Technology,
Inc., formed last year, is a Chinese IT startup that specializes in
delivering multimedia information technology to those in the
educational field. Their strategy&mdash;involving another Chinese
corporation, Sundiro, which provides information-security
software&mdash;represents the first full-scale implementation of
server-based computing in China. The first deployment of GraphOn
Bridges will take place this month at Beijing Concord College, a
private school serving grades 10 through college level.</p><p>Said Francis Pang, Chairman of Beijing Concord College,
&ldquo;GraphOn Bridges technology offers a means to rapidly deliver
Linux, UNIX and Windows applications to more than five million
students in the next three years. We see thin client, server-based
computing as the path to network our many older PCs while playing a
key role in a post-PC connectivity strategy.&rdquo;</p><p>One plus for the Chinese in the open-source, server-based
approach is the ability of China to play more of a role in its own
computing destiny, as opposed to having that destiny dictated to
them by a proprietary (and capitalist) Western corporation. Said
Zhicheng Yang, General Manager of Sundiro, &ldquo;We anticipate GraphOn's
operating system-neutral architecture will afford Chinese PC users
the flexibility to use both old and new technology. This freedom
enables us to be productive today while spawning a native Chinese
IT community that will be able to develop future applications that
reflect China's own culture.&rdquo;</p><p>As you might imagine, however, some are suggesting that
China's interest in server-based computing may not be as honorable
as it seems. According to a report on
<a href="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/991110/22/ax8w.html" target="_self">Yahoo!
UK</a>, what the Chinese are especially interested in is the
ability to keep tabs on just what kind of computing Chinese
citizens are up to.</p><p>All the same, there are serious obstacles to wiring a country
of a billion people living in a half-closed, half-open economy. For
all of the ominous and well-deserved fears of Big Server in China,
the idea of installing thousands of individual operating systems
and applications for thousands of individual Chinese computer users
(&ldquo;Let a Thousand Desktops Bloom?&rdquo;) is a daunting notion for a
Chinese leadership determined to stay connected to an increasingly
wired world.</p><p>Said Robin Ford, executive vice president for GraphOn, in the
aforementioned report from Yahoo! UK, &ldquo;It's all about control but
it's not an ugly or bad control. It's not a big brother thing. It's
about cost control ... they've looked at the problems that other
markets have had with desktop-based applications and want to avoid
them.&rdquo;</p><p>And with the increased emphasis on network computing and
application service providers here in the West, China's latest
technology play may be just the strategy it needs to incorporate
the best of Torvalds, Ellison, and Gates.</p></div></div>
