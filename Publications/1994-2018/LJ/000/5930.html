I'll be at
<a href="http://www.edventure.com/pcforum/home.cfm" target="_self">PC
Forum</a> in Arizona starting Sunday, March 24. Among the
speakers I'll see (and perhaps meet) are RIAA President Hilary
Rosen, FCC Chairman Michael Powell, Intel President &amp; CEO Craig
Barrett, Intel EVP Les Valdasz and Senator Maria Cantwell. If you
have any tough questions or constructive suggestions you want me to
bring to them (and others), write me at
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>. I'll be there
and on the Net wirelessly (if all goes well). Rosen, Cantwell and
Powell are there on Sunday, Barrett's there on Monday. Also look
for reports from the conference on the <i  >Linux Journal</i> site.
&mdash;DS</p><p>This morning, I went to the kitchen to graze among the
leftovers and refuel on coffee. For company I turned on the radio
and punched up my favorite station, SCAN. Since the radio happened
to be on the AM band, its first stop was one of the half-dozen or
so signals that carry
<a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/today.guest.html" target="_self">Rush
Limbaugh</a>. Surprise: the big guy's panties were knotted
around campaign finance reform. As usual, he was punching away at
liberals, this time mocking their worries about the influence of
&ldquo;special interests&rdquo;, which he called a liberal label for &ldquo;anything
that's critical of government.&rdquo;</p><p>I nearly blew coffee out my nose. As interests go, none are
quite so special as the entertainment industry. And, as it
happened, I had been busy at my desk trying to find how many pieces
of silver it took to turn
<a href="http://www.senate.gov/~hollings" target="_self">Senator Ernest &ldquo;Fritz&rdquo;
Hollings</a> into the entertainment industry's sock
puppet.</p><p>According to
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/21828.html" target="_self"><span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Register</em></span></a>, AOL Time Warner, News Corp, CBS
(Viacom), NBC and Disney have each spent upwards of five figures
over the last few years on Sen. Hollings. All told, individuals
from various entertainment companies have contributed $287,534
since 1995. Not a huge sum, as soft money goes, but apparently
enough to buy The Industry what it wanted. Which was&mdash;all together
now&mdash;more government!</p><p>Last September, Senators Hollings and Ted Stevens together
authored the
<a href="http://www.eff.org/alerts/20010921_eff_sssca_alert.html" target="_self">Security
Systems Standards and Certification Act</a> (SSSCA), which the
EFF says (in that last link there) was mostly written by Walt
Disney Corp. and would mandate digital rights management (DRM) in
all new PCs and other consumer electric instruments for the
conveyance of &ldquo;content&rdquo;.</p><p>Linux, which mostly runs on wide-open generic hardware, would
be screwed, along with the Net and the whole computer industry, not
to mention the economies that depend on them. This naturally fails
to concern the protected inhabitants of &ldquo;the regulatory
environment&rdquo;. In fact, these cattle think it's high time to
regulate and bureaucratize technology's wild frontier&mdash;to their
advantage, of course. That's why they bought Mr. Hollings.</p><p>For a better look at the invisible gland that works Hollings'
mouth&mdash;and how it inveighs against the
<a href="http://plus.maths.org/issue14/features/smith" target="_self">invisible
hand</a> of the real marketplace&mdash;here are some excerpts from
the Senator's opening statement at the
<a href="http://commerce.senate.gov/press/107-159.html" target="_self">Hearing
on Protecting Content in a Digital Age-Promoting Broadband and the
Digital Television Transition</a> (yes, it was called that) on
February 28. Fittingly, Hollings spoke in all-caps, which makes him
easy to quote:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>WITH THE EXCEPTION OF RURAL AMERICA AND SOME
UNDESERVED AREAS, THERE IS NO BROADBAND AVAILABILITY PROBLEM; WE
HAVE A DEMAND PROBLEM. 80% CAN GET IT, ONLY 10-12% TAKE IT. MOST
AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO PAY $50 A MONTH FOR FASTER ACCESS TO EMAIL.
IF MORE CONTENT WERE AVAILABLE ONLINE, CONSUMERS WOULD COME.</p></blockquote></div><p>Translation: if it were television they'd be all over
it.</p><p>The reason most people don't want to spend $50 a month for
broadband (a low estimate, no?) is that, like Sen. Hollings, they
don't understand it. Two reasons: 1) The
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_self">biggest OS vendor on
Earth</a> makes broadband as
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/HWDEV/archive/newPC/WinMe_broadband.asp" target="_self">complicated
as possible</a>, and 2) The
<a href="http://www.aol.com" target="_self">biggest ISP on Earth</a>
doesn't want its dial-up customers to understand it.</p><p>A few days ago I spent over an hour trying to get my
sister-in-law's Windows machine to run the crapware that plays way
too much of the stuff on the Web that requires broadband. The poor
box kept insisting that it needed new versions of Flash, Windows
Media Player and RealPlayer, all of which took forever to install
and reinstall, involving multiple crashes along the way, with no
useful assistance from anything on any of the vendors'
sites.</p><p>Although it's true that AOL offers some kind of broadband,
finding out about it is a whole 'nuther matter. Just for chuckles,
go to the AOL site and look for the broadband link. Hint: Scroll
down. It's in the lower right corner of the page.</p><p>Here's what it says:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>AOL PlusAOL Offers High Speed DSLInstant On!
Download up to 50 times faster.  Free
activation&mdash;<a href="http://free.aol.com/tryaolfree/wr31_aolhsb/nq_sell.adp?db_status=true&amp;session_id=157192000&amp;wr_promo=94&amp;error=-1" target="_self">click

</p></blockquote></div><p>Click on the link and what do you get? &ldquo;Welcome to America

details below)&rdquo;. Not one word about &ldquo;AOL Plus&rdquo;, DSL, faster
downloads or anything else. Is AOL ready to give up narrowband that
pulls more money per household than basic cable?</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>THERE IS ALMOST NO LEGAL, HIGH QUALITY CONTENT
AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET.</p></blockquote></div><p>Translation: Nothing in the galaxy of goods on the Net even
begins to count. Not the on-line journals, not the music, not the
good information put up by governments, individuals and businesses
all over the world&mdash;including the
<a href="http://commerce.senate.gov/hearings/hearings.htm" target="_self">very
testimony we're quoting here</a>. (It's there in .pdf)</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>WHY? BECAUSE THERE IS NO SINGLE, OPEN STANDARD
PROVIDING TECHNOLOGICAL PROTECTION TO COPYRIGHTED PRODUCTS TO GIVE
CONTENT OWNERS THE CONFIDENCE TO PLACE THEIR PREMIUM CONTENT
ONLINE.</p></blockquote></div><p>Translation: the only content worthy of the name, or the
adjective &ldquo;premium&rdquo;, comes from big-name copyright holders.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>THE SAME IS TRUE FOR DIGITAL TELEVISION, WHERE
PIRACY DETERS PROGRAMMERS FROM PUTTING DIGITAL CONTENT OVER THE
AIRWAVES.</p></blockquote></div><p>True for the supply side. But what about demand? Where are
the millions of viewers, waving their remote controls in the air
demanding to see
<a href="http://www2.warnerbros.com/web/friendstv/index.jsp" target="_self"><span   class="emphasis"><em>Friends</em></span></a>
on their Gateways?</p><p>Earth to Fritz: Television isn't in the business of selling
&ldquo;content&rdquo; to viewers. What they call &ldquo;content&rdquo; is just fertilizer
for potatoes whose eyes are sold to advertisers. Want to know why
the potatoes don't miss fertilizer on their computers? Listen to
the Mute button, dude. On computers they're not &ldquo;consumers&rdquo; any
more. They're customers, and they're not buying stuff that
worthless even when it's free.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>...ABSENT STRONG TECHNOLOGICAL PROTECTIONS
LAYERED ON TOP OF THE COPYRIGHT LAWS, IT IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO
ENFORCE THE LAW AS IT EXISTS. YOU CAN SEE TODAY. THOSE AMERICANS
WHO DO ACCESS TOP NOTCH CONTENT ONLINE ARE OFTEN STEALING IT. EVERY
WEEK A MAJOR MAGAZINE OR NEWSPAPER REPORTS ON THE THOUSANDS OF
ILLEGAL PIRATED WORKS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR COPYING AND
REDISTRIBUTION ONLINE. ACADEMY AWARD WINNING MOTION PICTURES,
PLATINUM RECORDS, AND EMMY AWARD WINNING TELEVISION SHOWS - ALL FOR
FREE, ALL ILLEGAL.</p></blockquote></div><p>Here's a good example: Steven Levy, writing in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Newsweek</em></span>, published on the Web by MSNBC,
<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/718454.asp#BODY" target="_self">&ldquo;The
Customer is Always Wrong</a>: Music and film moguls, and a few
senators, think fans are thieves and want to cripple technology to
stop you from making copies&rdquo;.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>WHEN CONGRESS SITS IDLY BY IN THE FACE OF THESE
ACTIVITIES, WE ESSENTIALLY SANCTION THE INTERNET AS A HAVEN FOR
THIEVERY. THIS PROBLEM CANNOT BE MINIMIZED. PIRACY IS GROWING
EXPONENTIALLY ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND AMONG TECH SAVVY CONSUMERS.
OVER TEN MILLION PEOPLE USE FILE SHARING SITES ON THE INTERNET TO
DOWNLOAD MOVIES, SONGS, AND TV SHOWS, WITH NO PENALTY. SUCH AN
ATMOSPHERE CONTRIBUTES TO THE STUDIOS AND RECORD LABELS' RELUCTANCE
TO PLACE THEIR DIGITAL CONTENT ON THE INTERNET OR OVER THE
AIRWAVES.</p></blockquote></div><p>Translation: Rather than a real marketplace where businesses
have enormous opportunities to innovate and interact directly with
customers, the Net is just as a den of thieves. Nice &ldquo;thinking&rdquo;,
Fritz.</p><p>The Net's only defender at the Hollings hearings was Intel
EVP Les Vadasz, also president of Intel Capital, the VC arm of the
chip giant. Here's some of what he had to say:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The IT industry is all about innovation; we
embrace and champion technological progress. The content community,
by contrast, has historically feared technology&mdash;from the advent
of sound recording, to the development of the VCR, the DVD, the PC
and other digital devices. Yet every advancement in technology has
proven to be a major growth catalyst for the studios. Videocassette
rental and sales totaled about 11 billion dollars last year,
exceeding box office receipts by some 2+ billion dollars. This is
the device once referred to by Jack Valenti as the &ldquo;Boston
Strangler&rdquo; of the film industry. Other &ldquo;attackers&rdquo; of the film
industry include the DVD, which added another 5.9 billion to studio
receipts in the last year.
</p><p>...Any attempt to inject a regulatory process into the design
of our products will irreparably damage the high-tech industry: it
will substantially retard innovation, investment in new
technologies, and will reduce the usefulness of our products to
consumers.</p></blockquote></div><p>He goes on to describe the comparative sizes of the IT and
entertainment industries ($600 billion vs. $35 billion) and the
role freedom from government interference has played in IT
industrial growth. Then he adds:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>This dynamic of innovation would be choked by any
attempt to regulate the design of products solely for the benefit
of one industry. Designing products through a regulatory process,
as some studios have advocated, would inject political influences
into technology development in very destructive ways. Investment
and innovation will both suffer, as a fear of entanglement with
government processes will have a chilling effect on investors and
subject new ideas to &ldquo;reg review&rdquo;.</p></blockquote></div><p>He concludes:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I would like to leave this Committee with the
following thoughts:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>First, listen to the consumer&mdash;he is paying the
bill for all of our products. Consumers want flexibility and power
in digital products and robust applications.</p></li><li><p>Second, do not tinker with the IT industry by
trying to regulate the development of our&mdash;technologies.
Irreparable damage will result&mdash;the pace of innovation,
productivity growth, and our industry's contribution to economic
growth will all decline.</p></li><li><p>Third, do not buy into a view of content protection
that will deprive consumers of the ability to get the full benefit
of the capabilities of the PC by neutering it&mdash;when it comes to
content management&mdash;to be nothing more than a more expensive
version of a &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; DVD player.</p></li></ul></div>

</p></blockquote></div><p>Think about how many of the Web's servers are running on
Linux, and you start to get the penguin perspective on the
matter&mdash;and on Intel's relationship to the popularity of Linux.
Then consider the compute power behind some of the private web
services we take for granted, such as
<a href="http://www.google.com" target="_self">Google's</a>, which runs on
more than 10,000 boxes with both Linux and Intel inside, all
searching through more than two billion pages of that worthless
content Sen. Hollings talked about.</p><p>Then go back and ask what's so special about Disney's
interest in Sen. Hollings.</p><p>Simply put, Disney is interested in maintaining the
powerlessness of The Consumer. Michael Eisner and his congressional
puppets want to dismantle the Net for one single reason: it's a
platform for markets where demand has just as much power as
supply.</p><p>What's really scary for Mr. Eisner isn't The Consumer paying
the bill for Intel's products. It's the fact that the Net makes The
Consumer into a real, in-your-face customer.</p><p>A year ago in Florida I spoke at a meeting of
<a href="http://www.gegxs.com/index.jsp" target="_self">GE Global eXchange
Services</a>, a B2B e-commerce network that processes over a
trillion dollars in transactions for more than 100,000 trading
partners all over the world. Harvey Seegers, the President and CEO
of GEX, told me he agreed with me that &ldquo;the Net creates a balance
of power between supply and demand&rdquo;. As a commanding supplier, GE
used to be in charge of its customer relationships. &ldquo;Not anymore&rdquo;,
he said. &ldquo;It's a whole new world.&rdquo; It was clear at the meeting that
GEX was busy doing everything it could to cope with operating in a
new kind of marketplace. And they were excited about it.</p><p>But not Disney. Not News Corp. These guys are having trouble
making the transition from potato farming to whatever comes next.
They have no idea how to do business with resourceful human beings
rather than passive vegetables. So they run to government for
protection.</p><p>True, a lot of customers are still in the dark about OS
choices other than Microsoft and about ISP choices other than AOL.
But when it comes to the supply side of the entertainment
production and distribution business, customers have seen the dark
at the end of the tunnel. Thanks to the Net, they've turned toward
the light that comes from each other.</p><p>Let's look at what they've done:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Napster and its successors are the listeners'
workaround of the failed radio industry, which replaced trusted
music connoisseurs with
<a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/feature/2001/03/14/payola" target="_self">payola-driven
robots</a> that serve only as freebie machines for the record
industry's pop music factories.</p></li><li><p><a href="http://www.kurthanson.com" target="_self">Internet
radio</a> is one way music connoisseurs are working around the
same problem from the supply side.</p></li><li><p><a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/DeCSS" target="_self">DeCSS</a>
is the people's workaround of the consumer electronics cartel,
which doesn't know how to cope with an operating system that isn't
owned by a vendor.</p></li></ul></div><p>Other workarounds are bound to follow, over and over, until
the entertainment industry starts serving fully empowered customers
or gets replaced by something that will. Protective legislation
will only make the process happen faster. But that's no reason to
just let nature take its course. The Net is a geek-built world. We
can't passively tolerate insults to its ecosystem.</p><p>In the last
<a href="http://www.ssc.com/pipermail/suitwatch/2002q1/000016.html" target="_self">SuitWatch
newsletter</a>, I raised a warning about another regulatory
time bomb; the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel (CARP) report,
which seeks to regulate internet radio (webcasting) as an
entertainment performance venue in the form of a file downloading
service (in which each file streamed can be charged at up to .14
cents a piece, retroactively to 1995).</p><p>As it turns out, the
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright/fedreg/2002/67fr10652.html" target="_self">deadline
for filing comments on CARP</a> has been extended to April
5.</p><p>So now is the time to call and/or write your elected
representatives. Let them know that you listen to and value
Internet radio. Tell them you don't want it taxed at the source,
that you don't want it regulated out of business before it even has
a chance to become one.</p><p>For more on the subject, visit any or all of these
