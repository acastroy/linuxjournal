    There's no need to get all fancy with a new computer and lots of
    extra programs. Here's one more way you can turn that old box into a
    useful machine again.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1778580.0x1870240"></a></h2></div></div><p>My wife has a profound mistrust of the
blessings of modern life. Computer-wise she recently upgraded to a
recycled Compaq DeskPro 386/25e after wearing out the XT she bought
in 1987. All she needs from a computer is a text editor for writing
and a spreadsheet program for organizing. She uses WP 4.2, Norton
commander (to move files) and VP Planner (a Lotus 123 clone); all
three she got around 1987. But now she wanted me to add her system
to our home network, but without changing anything on her system.
First she wanted to be able to transfer files from her system to
mine. This I solved quite easily. Then she wanted Internet access
from her old DOS machine&mdash;not so easy.</p><p>My home network is made of eight systems that I run as a
Beowulf. Each system is different, and I made all of them from
recycled parts. So I decided to hook my wife's little computer to
the head node. The following is a description of how I did this and
the hardware I used.</p><p>My system, tenn, (short for Tennessee Tuxedo, a cartoon
penguin in the US) is a dual-boot Linux/MS 3.1 PI/166MHz with a
6.4GB hard drive and a PCI NIC. My wife's system, hilde, is a
Compaq 386/25e with a 120MB hard drive and a NE2000 clone NIC that
I added. Patch cables go from both systems to a D-Link 8-port hub.
Looking at the software, she has MS-DOS version 5.0 on her
computer. I have a standard install of SuSE 7.2 pro on my
system.</p><p>The idea was to set this up so that my system was a
fileserver to her system. I solved the fileserver problem two
times. The first time she wanted to be able to connect to my system
as if it was her DOS d:\ partition. To do this, I set up
Microsoft's DOS Network client on her computer and then started
Samba on my Linux system.</p><p>New problem: when I told my wife that I had used MS software
to get her system connected, she was not amused at all and demanded
that I use open-source software only. It did not sway her when I
explained that she was already running MS-DOS. Her reasoning was
that MS-DOS was written before MS became the evil empire, so it was
okay.</p><p>Back to the drawing board. I found in my SuSE CDs a DOS
utility called XFS, an open-source NFS client for DOS. This
software was what I needed. On her system I set up XFS and on my
system I added pcnfsd so XFS could login.</p><p>Here, then, is how I set up file sharing both ways. You
decide which is better for you.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1778580.0x1870558"></a>Setting up MS-DOS Network Client</h2></div></div><p>First you need to download Microsoft's DOS Network client
software from their FTP site. There are two files from MS
dsk3-1.exe and dsk3-2.exe. If you have the DOS drivers for your
NIC, you only need the first file. But it was easier to use the MS
disks, so I did.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5837f1.large.jpg"><img src="5837f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Starting the MS Network Client
Install</p></div></div>
</p><p>Here is where you start the MS install. Going from the top of
the list, you need to give, i.e., change, your machine a name. I
gave hilde as the name on the first two lines, but the other two
can be left at the default &ldquo;workgroup&rdquo;.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5837f2.large.jpg"><img src="5837f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Setup for MS Network
Client</p></div></div>
</p><p>Go back to the main menu and make the next selection, Setup.
You can leave all of this set to the defaults.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5837f3.large.jpg"><img src="5837f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. Adding the Adapter</p></div></div>
</p><p>Now we get to the meat of the setup, Change Network
Configuration. At this menu the first thing we should do is &ldquo;add
adapter&rdquo;. Clicking on this will give you a list of all the drivers
MS has. Select the one for your machine. Now we should change
settings. If you have a NIC selected, it should show up on this
menu. You'll need to add the IO and the IRQ numbers here, as well
as the &ldquo;adapter slot number&rdquo;, the slot you've put your NIC in.
Start with the left slot as number 1 counting to the right, up to
number 8. This information is probably needed only for an EISA
motherboard.</p><p>&ldquo;Add protocol&rdquo; is the next step, and the spot where most
people mess up. MS will default to IPX, but you need to change it
to TCP/IP. At the same time you should delete the IPX line, so that
MS will not be confused. To delete the IPX protocol you need to tab
to the upper menu and highlight the IPX line. Then tab back to the
lower menu and click delete.</p><p>At this point highlight the line that says &ldquo;options are
correct&rdquo; and press Return. MS will take over and install all the
software. Now you need to reboot your DOS machine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1778580.0x1870e48"></a>DOS Batch Files</h2></div></div><p>To keep it as simple as possible on the DOS system, I wrote
two batch files for hilde. The startd.bat file loads all the
networking files that DOS needs to connect. Because my wife does
not need to be connected all the time, I put all the network
programs into this file. Doing so frees up more of her system's
memory. On that note, I wrote stopd.bat. This way she could free
the memory up for other things when she was done transferring
files. Her system has 4MB of main memory, which is quite a bit for
a DOS-only system, so it's seldom that she receives an
out-of-memory error.</p><p>############### startd.bat
#############################################</p><pre     class="programlisting">
@echo off
C:\NET\net initialize
C:\NET\netbind.com
C:\NET\umb.com
C:\NET  cptsr.exe
C:\NET  inyrfc.exe
C:\NET\nmtsr.exe
C:\NET\emsbfr.exe
C:\NET\net start
net use * \     enn\cdisk
</pre><p>This batch file is a lot simpler than it looks. When I set up
the MS client on hilde, the setup program put all the c:\NET\XXX
programs in the autoexe.bat file. Since I did not want to have the
Net start up every time the system turned on, I took these lines
out and put them in the startd file. At the last line the system
really makes the connection. This Net command means use the first
open dir letter, i.e., *. You could give a letter, for example D:\,
and connect to system \ enn's cdisk. Please note that this is not
tenn's dir cdisk but the Samba share cdisk. Lastly you can add a
password for Samba at the end. It is unnecessary here, but if you
leave it off the program will ask you for one each time it
starts.</p><p>When my wife is done with moving files around, she can turn
the connection off by commanding <b  >stopd.bat</b>,
which contains the line <b  >net use *
/delete</b>.</p><p>The MS client uses about 100k of memory when it's running,
which is no real problem because hilde has 4MB of memory. But some
of the older DOS programs recognize only the first 640k. So even
when the computer has plenty of space they bomb out. I later found
out that stopd does not stop all the MS Net software; two or three
programs are still running in the background. It seems that the
only way to stop them is to reboot the system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1778580.0x18711b8"></a>Setting up Samba on Your Linux System</h2></div></div><p>The easiest way to start Samba is to edit your rc.config file
in /etc. Change the <b  >START_SMB="no"</b> line to
<b  >START_SMB="yes"</b>. Then run
<b  >SuSEconfig</b>. Of course, you have to do this part
as root. If you cannot find this line in rc.config, Samba is not
yet on your system and you need to install it. You can do that in
YaST, the SuSE program to configure and administer your operating
system. If you use another Linux distribution, use its
configuration tools to install Samba.</p><p>To get Samba to work, you have to edit the file named
&ldquo;smb.conf&rdquo;. Since my system is a home network and is not connected
to the Internet, I've left out all security. If you are connected
to the Net, don't use this or, if you do, be sure to add all the
security measures.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

        read only = no
        browseable = yes
        public = yes
        guest ok = yes
</pre><p>To keep it simple, I did not add printer support. This is
easily added, but WP 4.2 does not print correctly on my Epson, so I
left it off. When my wife needs something printed, I transfer it to
AbiWord and print it under Linux. Because her computer hilde has a
MS-DOS filesystem, it would have problems reading my Linux files.
Therefore, I restricted hilde to have access to only my /cdisk,
which I had set up as a MS-DOS system for MS Windows. After you've
got this done you should, as root, restart Samba with <b  >smbd
restart</b> so that Samba will read the changes. At this
time, I also added hilde to my hosts files with this line:</p><p><b  >192.168.17.99 hilde</b></p><p>This might not be needed, but it makes it easier than always
typing <b  >192.168.17.99</b> when I am referring to
hilde.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1778580.0x1871688"></a>Setting up XFS/pcnfsd</h2></div></div><p>The MS software comes with its own packet driver for the
NE2000. Oddly enough, when I switched to other software the MS
driver would not work. Therefore I had to look for a different
driver for my card. Files full of drivers for almost all the older
cards can be found on the Internet. The best packet driver I found
was written by Crynwr; it's was simple and problem free. The driver
has only three options and two are not always needed.</p><p>As much as possible, I use the most common type of cards in
all my computers. It just makes things simpler. In this case I had
in my wife's computer a NE2000 clone card, the most common of all
NICs. To get it up and running I only had to use the command
<b  >ne2000 0x60 10 0x300</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1778580.0x1871840"></a>Setting up XFS on DOS</h2></div></div><p>On the first SuSE CD is a directory called DOSutils. It has
two subdirectories for XFS, one for plain DOS and the other for
Windows. I used the plain DOS directory, called xfs186. This should
work on any non-Windows DOS systems. It is easy to put all the XFS
files on one 1.44 diskette and move it to the DOS system. I put all
the files in the directory named XFS, then added the directory to
the path list in the autoexec.bat file.</p><p>There are three files you need to configure in the XFS
directory on your DOS system: hosts, xfs.bat and init.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

change the names and numbers to the ones of your home network

</pre><p>The above is the xfs.bat file, which starts the XFS system
running. The first line loads your packet driver into high memory.
If you have a NIC other than a NE2000 clone, you need to change
this first line to match your NIC's software. The next line is
needed only if you plan on using Windows 3.1; otherwise you can
delete it. Next is the XFS program itself. Once the program is up
and running, we have to initialize the connection between the two
systems. This is done with the xfstool program. This one line runs
the entire command script below. In the sample the line only says
<b  >xfstool @init</b>. But there is one problem: the
program cannot find the script file, even though the XFS dir is
part of the path in autoexec.bat. Solution: I had to add the path
to it, then it worked fine.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# XFS Version 1.8

mount    d: tenn:/home/hilde/temp
mount    e: tenn:/cdisk
# mount lpt2: speedy:laser timeo=30
umask 000
#
</pre><p>In the command script you start with, initialize the
connection between hilde and tenn. Then you must tell tenn that you
need the NFS filesystem with the command <b  >pcnfsd
tenn</b>.</p><p>Now you can login to the NFS system and mount the directories
you need. For the XFS system I set up two DOS letter directories, d
and e. The d: dir is in the Linux filesystem, and the e: dir is in
the MS-DOS system. The umask command tells XFS to set the
read/write permissions to allow access to all (<b  >chmod 666
*</b>on the Linux system).</p><p>One odd thing about using the XFS system here is that I can
read and write on the Linux filesystem without any problems. But I
get permission-denied errors when I try to write to the MS-DOS
partition. For example, a file is opened on tenn and saved as zero
bits. I can read the partition fine, so it looks like a bug in the
XFS software. Since hilde does not need to access the printer, I
commented out the mount printer line.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1778580.0x1c69fb8"></a>Setting up pcnfsd on Linux</h2></div></div><p>When you run a normal Linux NFS system, you will find a
d&aelig;mon called nfsd. This d&aelig;mon only works with other
Linux/UNIX systems. To get XFS (on hilde) to run with your Linux
computer, you need a different d&aelig;mon; you need to add the
pcnfsd software to your system. In SuSE it's simple to add this
d&aelig;mon. Simply run YaST and install it, then turn it on in the
rc.config file. Each time you add a d&aelig;mon to your system, any
configurations you need to do will be added to the end of this
file.</p><p>Next you need to add this line to the exports file in
/etc.</p><p><b  >/ hilde(rw)</b></p><p>This allows hilde access to all files on your computer. You
might want to limit it to some part like this:</p><p><b  >/cdisk hilde(rw)</b></p><p>Now hilde can only mount your /cdisk. At this point you need
to command (as root) <b  >pcnfsd restart</b> to get this
d&aelig;mon up and running. Once you have hilde connected, you
should find in your systems messages file these two lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

to be able to send and receive e-mail and browse the Web. So I had
to come up with a way to do that. I looked at all the DOS programs
for e-mail and browsing and came to the conclusion that they were
all a bit of a pain. Adding in the fact that I would have to set up
IP masquerading, etc., on Linux, it became a major pain. So I
decided to set her up as a user on my system. Now she can Telnet
into my computer and run Pine and Lynx under Linux, and I avoid all
the setup problems with DOS.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1778580.0x1c6a4e0"></a>Telnet</h2></div></div><p>I did a search on the Net for DOS Telnet clients. Going over
all of them, I ended up using sshdos. This is a secured client that
is somewhat overkill for a home network, but if you are Telneting
by the Net, it is quite nice to have.</p><p>A major problem with DOS is there is no central hosts file,
so each piece of software demands its configuring files in another
place. There are three files to configure to get sshdos running.

any type of windowing software. Such a little screen, overloaded
with windows, is hard to read and a horror for somebody who
believes, like my wife does, in simplicity. Therefore, I taught her
how to use Lynx and Pine. A standard SuSE install normally includes
these, so I will not go into installing them. Beyond teaching my
wife how to use each program, I had to do very little. I wanted
Lynx to be in color, and I wanted her bookmarks appear on the
screen when she started. Therefore I added an alias in the .bashrc
file for Lynx. Here is the line to add to the .bashrc file:</p><p><b  >alias lynx='lynx-color
lynx_bookmarks.html'</b></p><p>The neat thing about this is when you add a bookmark to your
file, it will show up next time you use Lynx.</p><p>On Pine I only showed her how to write an e-mail and send it.
I also helped her set up a .sig file. Of course, you will need to
reconfigure sendmail and fetchmail for two (or more) users. But
that's another article.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>James Hatridge</b></span> has a BS in
