Find out how to reconnect to Slack over IRC using a Bitlbee libpurple
plugin. By Kyle Rankin</h2>

<p>
I'm an IRC kind of guy. I appreciate the simplicity of pure text chat,
emoticons instead of emojis, and the vast array of IRC clients and servers to
choose from, including the option to host your own. All of my interactive
communication happens over IRC either through native IRC channels (like
#linuxjournal on Freenode) or using a local instance of Bitlbee to act as an
IRC gateway to other chat protocols. Because my IRC client supports
connecting to multiple networks at the same time, I've been able to manage
all of my personal chat, group chat and work chat from a single window that
I can connect to from any of my computers.
</p>

<p>
Before I upgraded to IRC, my very first chat experience was in the late 1990s
on a web-based Java chat applet, and although I hold some nostalgia for web-based
chat because I met my wife on that network, chatting via a web browser just
seems like a slow and painful way to send text across the internet. Also,
shortly after we met, the maintainers of that network decided to shut down the
whole thing, and since it was a proprietary network with proprietary
servers and clients, when they shut it down, all those chat rooms and groups
were lost.
</p>

<p>
What's old is new again. Instead of Java, we have JavaScript, and kids these
days like to treat their web browsers like Emacs, and so every application has
to run as a web app. This leads to the latest trend in chat: Slack. I say the
<em>latest</em> trend, because it wasn't very long ago that Hipchat was hip, and before
that, even Yammer had a brief day in the sun. In the past, a software project
might set up a channel on one of the many public or private IRC servers, but
nowadays, everyone seems to want to consolidate their projects under Slack's
infrastructure. This means if you joined a company or a software
project that started during the past few years, more likely than not, you'll
need to use Slack.
</p>

<p>
I'm part of a few Slack networks, and up until recently, I honestly didn't
think all that much about Slack, because unlike some other proprietary chat
networks, Slack had the sense to offer IRC and XMPP gateways. This meant that
you weren't required to use its heavy web app, but instead, you could use
whatever client you preferred yet still connect to Slack networks. Sure, my
text-based IRC client didn't show animated Giphy images or the 20
party-parrot gifs in a row, but to me, that was a feature. Unfortunately, Slack could
no longer justify the engineering effort to backport web chat features to IRC
and XMPP, so the company announced it was shutting down its IRC and XMPP
gateways.
</p>

<p>
When Slack first announced it was shutting down the IRC gateway, I wasn't
sure what I would do. I knew that I wouldn't use the web app, so I figured if
an alternative didn't come around, I'd just forget about the Slack networks I
was a part of, just like when that old Java chat shut down. Fortunately, the
FLOSS community saved the day, and someone wrote a plugin that uses the
libpurple library (a kind of Rosetta stone plugin framework for chat used by
programs like Pidgin and Bitlbee to allow access to ICQ, MSN, Yahoo and
other dead proprietary chat networks). Although using the direct IRC gateway was
easier, setting this up on Bitlbee wasn't so bad. So, in this article, I
describe how to do exactly that.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_31">
Why Not Weechat?</h3>

<p>
I know that many console-based chat fans have switched to Weechat as their
IRC client, and it has a native Slack plugin. That's great, but I've been
using Irssi for something like 15 years, so I'm not about to switch
clients just for Slack's sake. Anyway, with the Bitlbee program, you can
connect to Slack using your preferred IRC client whether that's Irssi, Xchat
or even MIRC (no judgment).
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_32">
Install the Slack libpurple Plugin for Bitlbee</h3>

<p>
Since the Slack Bitlbee plugin uses libpurple, the first step is to make sure
you install a Bitlbee package that has libpurple built in. On
Debian-based distributions, this means replacing the basic bitlbee package
with bitlbee-libpurple if you don't already have it installed. This package
should set up a local network service listening on the IRC
port automatically. I cover how to use Bitlbee in detail in my past article
<a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/magazine/hack-and-what-really-ircs-me-instant-messaging">"What
Really IRCs Me: Instant Messaging"</a>, so I recommend you refer to that
article for more
details.
</p>

<p>
Once you are connected to Bitlbee, you should be able to issue a <code>help
purple</code> command and get a list of existing libpurple plugins that it has
installed:

</p>
<pre><code>
19:23 @greenfly| help purple
19:23 @    root| BitlBee libpurple module supports the 
 ↪following IM protocols:
19:23 @    root|  
19:23 @    root| * aim (AIM)
19:23 @    root| * bonjour (Bonjour)
19:23 @    root| * gg (Gadu-Gadu)
19:23 @    root| * novell (GroupWise)
19:23 @    root| * icq (ICQ)
19:23 @    root| * irc (IRC)
19:23 @    root| * msn (MSN)
19:23 @    root| * loubserp-mxit (MXit)
19:23 @    root| * myspace (MySpaceIM)
19:23 @    root| * simple (SIMPLE)
19:23 @    root| * meanwhile (Sametime)
19:23 @    root| * jabber (XMPP)
19:23 @    root| * yahoo (Yahoo)
19:23 @    root| * yahoojp (Yahoo JAPAN)
19:23 @    root| * zephyr (Zephyr)
19:23 @    root|  
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Note that Slack isn't yet on this list. The next step is to build and install
the Slack libpurple plugin on your machine. To do this, make sure you have
general build tools installed on your system (for Debian-based systems, the
build-essential package takes care of this). Then install the libpurple-devel
or libpurple-dev package, depending on your distro. Finally, pull down the
latest version of the plugin from GitHub and build it:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ git clone https://github.com/dylex/slack-libpurple.git
$ cd slack-libpurple
$ sudo make install
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
(Note: if you don't have system-level access, you can run <code>make
install-user</code>
instead of <code>sudo make install</code> to install the plugin locally.)
</p>

<p>
Once the install completes, you should have a new library file in
/usr/lib/purple-2/libslack.so. Restart Bitlbee, and you should see a new
plugin in the list:

</p>
<pre><code>
19:23 @greenfly| help purple
19:23 @    root| BitlBee libpurple module supports the 
 ↪following IM protocols:
19:23 @    root|  
19:23 @    root| * aim (AIM)
19:23 @    root| * bonjour (Bonjour)
19:23 @    root| * gg (Gadu-Gadu)
19:23 @    root| * novell (GroupWise)
19:23 @    root| * icq (ICQ)
19:23 @    root| * irc (IRC)
19:23 @    root| * msn (MSN)
19:23 @    root| * loubserp-mxit (MXit)
19:23 @    root| * myspace (MySpaceIM)
19:23 @    root| * simple (SIMPLE)
19:23 @    root| * meanwhile (Sametime)
19:23 @    root| * slack (Slack)
19:23 @    root| * jabber (XMPP)
19:23 @    root| * yahoo (Yahoo)
19:23 @    root| * yahoojp (Yahoo JAPAN)
19:23 @    root| * zephyr (Zephyr)
19:23 @    root|  
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_33">
Configure Slack in Bitlbee</h3>

<p>
Once you have the Slack module set up, the next step is to configure it like
any other Bitlbee network. First, create a new Bitlbee account that
corresponds to your Slack account from the Bitlbee console:

</p>
<pre><code>
account add slack username@networkname.slack.com
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Next, you'll need to add what Slack calls a Legacy API token, which tells me
at some point Slack will deprecate this and leave us out in the cold again. To
do this, make sure you are logged in to Slack in your web browser, and then
visit <a href="https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens">https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens</a>.
On that page,
you will have the ability to generate API tokens for any Slack
networks where you are a member. 
Once you have the API token, go back to your Bitlbee console
and set it:

</p>
<pre><code>
account slack set api_token xoxp-jkdfaljieowajfeiajfiawlefje
account slack on
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
If this is the only Slack account you have created, it will label it as
"slack", and you can refer to it that way. Otherwise, you'll need to type
<code>account list</code> in the Bitlbee console and see how Bitlbee numbered your slack
account, and then replace <code>slack</code> in the above commands with the number
associated with that account.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, unlike with the IRC gateway, this plugin doesn't 
connect you to any channels in which you are active automatically. Instead, once your Bitlbee
client connects, you need to tell Bitlbee about any particular channels
you want to join. You can do this with the standard Bitlbee <code>chat add</code> command. So for
instance, to add and join the #general channel most Slack networks have, you
would type:

</p>
<pre><code>
chat add slack general
/join #general
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Note that like with the other previous commands, you may need to replace
<code>slack</code>
with the number associated with your account if you have multiple Slack
networks defined. 
</p>

<p>
If you want Bitlbee to rejoin a particular
room automatically whenever you connect, you can type:

</p>
<pre><code>
channel general set auto_join true
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Repeat this for any other channels you want to auto-join.
</p>

Conclusion</h3>

<p>
Okay, so maybe this article was a little bitter compared to others I've
written. I can't help it. It really bothers me when companies use their
control over proprietary software, networks or services to remove features
upon which people depend. I've also seen so many proprietary chat networks come and
go while IRC stays around, that I just wish people would stick with IRC, even
if they don't get the animated smiley emoji that turns around in a circle.
I'm very thankful for a solid community of developers who are willing to pore
through API docs to build new third-party plugins when necessary.
