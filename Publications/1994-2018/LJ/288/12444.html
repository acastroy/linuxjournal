<h1 class="title">The Open-Source Classroom: A Look at Google's Project Fi</h1>

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_41">Google's Project Fi is a great cell-phone service, but the data-only SIMs
make it incredible for network projects! By Shawn Powers</h2>

<p>
I have a lot of cell phones. I have iPhones (old and new), Android phones
(old, new, very old and funny-shaped), and I have a few legacy phones that
aren't either Android or iPhone. Remember Maemo? Yeah, and I still have one of those old
Nokia phones somewhere too. Admittedly, part of the reason I have such
a collection is that I tend to hoard nostalgic technology, but part of
it is practical too.
</p>

<p>
I've used phones as IP cameras for BirdTopia (my recorded and streamed
bird-feeder collection). I've created WiFi-only audiobook devices that
I use when I'm out and about. I've used old phones as SONOS remotes,
Plex players, Chromecast initiators and countless other tasks that tiny
little computers are perfect for doing. One of the frustrating things about
using old cell phones for projects like that though is they only have WiFi
access, because adding multiple devices to a cell plan becomes expensive
quickly. That's not the case anymore, however, thanks to Google's Project Fi.
</p>

<p>
Most people love Project Fi because of the tower-hopping features
or because of the fair pricing. I like those features too, but the real bonus
for me is the "data only" SIM option. Like most people, I rarely make
phone calls anymore, and there are so many chat apps, texting isn't very
important either. With most cell-phone plans, there's an "access" fee per
line. With Project Fi, additional devices don't cost anything more! (But,
more about that later.) The Project Fi experience is worth investigating.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_42">
What's the Deal?</h3>

<p>
Project Fi is a play on the term "WiFi" and is pronounced "Project Fye",
as opposed to "Project Fee", which is what I called it at first. 
Several features set Project Fi apart from other cell-phone plans.
</p>

<p>
First, Project Fi uses towers from three carriers: T-Mobile, US Cellular
and Sprint. When using supported hardware, Project Fi constantly
monitors signal strength and seamlessly transitions between the various
towers. Depending on where you live, this can mean constant access to the
fastest network or a better chance of having any coverage at all. (I'm
in the latter group, as I live in a rural area.)
</p>

<p>
The second standout feature of Project Fi is the pricing model. Every
phone pays a $20/month fee for unlimited calls and texts. On top of that,
all phones and devices share a data pool that costs $10/GB. The data
cost isn't remarkably low, but Google handles it very well. I recently
discovered that it's not billed in full $10 increments (Figure 1).
If you use 10.01GB of data, you pay $10.01, not $20.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Data Usage" src="12444f1.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 1. This amount of data would be expensive on a traditional plan, but with Project Fi, it's affordable.</p>
</div>
<p>
The least talked about, but perhaps most interesting, feature of Project
Fi is that you can order data-only SIM cards that share data with the
larger plan. Those SIMs come with no additional monthly fee, plus they don't
cost anything for activation.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_43">
Devices</h3>

<p>
One downside of using Project Fi is that only a handful of phones are
supported. There are workarounds for non-supported phones, but the
"magic" of Project Fi is the tower-hopping feature, and for that, only
certain phones qualify. At the time of this writing, the following phones
are compatible:
</p>

<ul><li>
Pixel 2
</li>

<li>
Pixel 2 XL
</li>

<li>
Pixel
</li>

<li>
Pixel XL
</li>

<li>
Moto X4
</li>

<li>
Nexus 5X
</li>

<li>
Nexus 6P
</li>

<li>
Nexus 6
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Most of the phones on the list aren't currently being manufactured,
but you can find refurbished ones. I personally opted for the Pixel 2, and
it's easily the nicest Android device I've ever owned. I could write
a separate review on the Pixel 2, but plenty of reviews already
exist. The only not-well-known downside to the Pixel 2 is that the
camera app, although <em>awesome</em>, doesn't support external
microphones, which
makes shooting YouTube videos more difficult.
</p>

<p>
I mentioned that although only a certain number of devices are officially
supported, other phones do technically work. Really, most
GSM-capable phones with SIM cards will function; they just lose the
automatic tower-hopping and will be stuck on T-Mobile. Unfortunately,
a SIM can't be activated on a non-compatible device, so you'll need
to activate it on someone's Pixel/Nexus, and then swap the SIM to your
phone. To add insult to injury, then the Pixel/Nexus that activated the SIM for you
can't be used on Project Fi because it's tied to the SIM. That said,
if you want more SIMs...read on.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_44">
The Magical SIM Cards</h3>

<p>
Google will let you purchase data-only SIM cards that share the data on
your plan. Actually, you can purchase up to nine data-only SIM cards and use
them on as many devices as you want. There's no additional monthly cost
for a data-only SIM, and in the mostly data world we live in, it could
mean an extremely affordable way to get cell phones for kids. If I look
on my current cell-phone plan, my kids almost never use actual minutes,
and although they do text, there are alternative ways to text that don't
require a phone number.
</p>

<p>
One unfortunate part of the data-only SIM is that it doesn't
tower-hopâ€”not even manually. Although the data-only SIM cards share a
data plan, they utilize only T-Mobile towers for access. In my
area, that's not an issue, because T-Mobile has the best coverage with
the fastest speed. It potentially could be a problem for someone in a
T-Mobile dead zone.
</p>

<p>
I can tell you that being able to add cellular data to any device without
incurring an additional monthly charge has been incredible. I find
myself doing projects with old phones and tablets that I never would have
considered. Here are a few examples:
</p>

<ul><li>
Permanent dash-mounted cell phone for Android Auto.
</li>

<li>
Trail-cam with remote access.
</li>

<li>
BirdCam on remote bird feeders.
</li>

<li>
Loner phones for international guests (or SIMs for their own devices).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It doesn't get much press, but the data-only SIM with Project Fi is
the reason I tried it in the first place. Project Fi doesn't have truly
unlimited data (well, not useful unlimited), but the data-only SIM is
great for most projects. It's been fun for me, because I've actually
installed mobile data into devices that I never intended to do so. A
Chromebook, for instance, that has a SIM slot was able to get mobile data,
which I'd never even considered trying before.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_45">
The Pricing Magic and the Catch</h3>

<p>
I mentioned that Project Fi charges only for the data you use. That's true,
but it gets even better. After 6GB, the "Bill Protection" kicks in,
and no additional charges are incurred for the current month. That means
the maximum a person with one phone and up to nine SIM cards will pay is
$80/month. You do need at least one phone on the plan, but it means an entire
family could have cell service (using data SIMs) for $80/month or less.
</p>

<p>
The big "gotcha" that I didn't realize at first was that although there is
no additional charge for data over 6GB, each device is soft-capped at
15GB of data. The data doesn't technically stop, but it is throttled
down to something like 256k. That's enough for sending email, but not
much else. 15GB per device is actually quite generous, but it does
mean Project Fi isn't a good solution for replacing a home internet
connection. Perhaps that's the reason there's a cap, because otherwise,
an entire neighborhood could share data SIMs and use Project Fi as its
ISP! Also, a data SIM shares data, so it's considered the same "device"
as the phone. That means (as far as I can tell) that once one of your
SIMs or phone reaches 15GB, all of them get throttled to 256k. If you
have another phone on the plan, supposedly it still will function at
full speed until it reaches 15GB, but I haven't tested that.
</p>

<p>
If you don't use much data, Project Fi is an incredible deal. If you
have lots of projects in which you'd like to use data SIMs, Project Fi is,
again, an
incredible deal. However, if you're the type of user who regularly uses
more than 15GB in a month (that is, not often on WiFi), Project Fi might not be
ideal. In fact, if you use 4â€“5GB per month regularly, there are plans from
places like Red Pocket that cost $30/month and include unlimited calls and
texts with 5GB of data. With a single phone, that usage would cost $70 on
Project Fi. The moral of the story is, it's important to understand your
usage, because what might be an incredible deal for one person will end
up being highway robbery for another. This month, I've used 0.12GB of
data on my phone and SIMs combined. That means for all those devices,
I'll pay only a little more than $21! That's really small usage, however,
and I know it. (My work-provided phone has many GB of usage this month.)
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_46">
Making It Work</h3>

<p>
If you have a compatible device, getting Project Fi working is a
no-brainer. If you have a different device, as I already mentioned, you'll
need to activate the service on a compatible device and then swap the SIM
into your Android (or even iPhone). You should be able to get calling,
texting and data to work, but it only can use the T-Mobile towers like
the data-only SIMs do. And at the time of this writing, the compatible device
used to activate the SIM can't be used on Project Fi because its IMEI
number is tied to the account.
</p>

<p>
If you do have a compatible device, it's possible to force a specific
tower using dialer codes. Apps like FiSwitch will
enter the dial codes automatically for changing towers and will give you an
icon in the notification area to show you which tower you're currently
using. I've found automatic switching to be pretty reliable, but manually
switching is fun to watch.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Screenshot" src="12444f2.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 2. I thought I'd use the manual switching more often than I do, but the information in the notification area regarding which tower you're currently using is nice.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_47">
Project Fi, for Me and Mine?</h3>

<p>
Project Fi is a revolutionary cell service that makes really good
sense for some cases. Kyle Rankin first turned me on to Project Fi,
and it has saved his family a lot of money. They don't use a lot of
data, so the price is lower than other options, <em>plus</em> they get the
cool tower-hopping feature. For my purposes, the data-only SIMs really
sold the package. Oddly, the plan wouldn't be good for me and my family,
because we use far too much data on a monthly basis. But for fun projects
and old cell phones, Project Fi has been awesome.
</p>

<p>
I encourage you to examine your recent cell-phone bills and figure out if
Project Fi would make financial sense. If your usage is like the Rankin
family's, it could save you a ton of money. Or if you want to put data in
a bunch of devices without paying per device, the data-only SIMs might
be worth the cost. The bill is paid monthly, so there's no worry about
long-term commitments. Payment is handled via Google Pay, just like
apps purchased from the Google Play store. It's so simpleâ€”if you have
a compatible device, you might want to try it just for fun.
</p>

<p>
If you do get Project Fi and use the data SIMs for projects, please write
in, I'd love to hear about them!
