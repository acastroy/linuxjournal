<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_86">Free software deserves free tools, not Microsoft-owned GitHub. By Matt
Lee</h2>

<p>
So, Microsoft bought GitHub, and many people are confused or
worried. It's not a new phenomenon when any large company buys any
smaller company, and people are right to be worried, although I argue
that their timing is wrong. Like Microsoft, GitHub has made some
useful contributions to free and open-source software, but let's not
forget that GitHub's main product is proprietary software. And, it's not
just some innocuous web service either; GitHub makes and sells a
proprietary software package you can download and run on your own
server called GitHub Enterprise (GHE).

<p>
Let's remember how we got here. BitMover made a tool called BitKeeper,
a proprietary version control system that allowed free-of-charge
licenses to free software projects. In 2002, the Linux kernel switched
to using BitKeeper for its version control, although some notable
developers made the noble choice to refuse to use the proprietary
program. Many others did not, and for a number of years, kernel development 
was hampered by BitKeeper's restrictive noncommercial licenses.
</p>

<p>
In 2005, Andrew Tridgell, working at OSDL, developed a client
that bypassed this restriction, and as a result, BitMover removed
licenses to BitKeeper from all OSDL employees—including Linus
Torvalds. Eventually, all non-commercial licenses were stopped, and new
licenses included clauses preventing the development of alternative
version control systems. As a result of this, two new projects were
born: Mercurial and Git. Created in a few short weeks in 2005, Git
quickly became the version control system for Linux development. [See Zack
Brown's article in this issue for more details on Git's origins.]
</p>

<p>
Proprietary version control tools aren't common in free software
development, but proprietary collaboration websites have been around
for some time. One of the earliest collaboration websites still around
today is Sourceforge. Sourceforge was created in the late 1990s by VA
Software, and the code behind the project was released in
2000. 
</p>

<p>
Quickly this situation changed, and <a href="http://fsfe.org/news/2001/article2001-10-20-01.en.html">the project was shuttered
and then became Sourceforge Enterprise
Edition</a>, a
proprietary software package. The code that ran Sourceforge was forked
into GNU Savannah (later Savane) and GForge, and it's still use today by
both the GNU Project and CERN. When <a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/savannah">I last wrote about this
problem</a>, almost exactly
ten years ago, Canonical's ambitious Launchpad service still
was proprietary, something later remedied in 2009. Gitorious was created
in 2010 and was for a number of years the Git hosting platform for the
discerning free software developer, as the code for Gitorious was
fully public and licensed under favorable terms for the new wave of
AGPL-licensed projects that followed the FSF's Franklin Street
Statement. Gitorious, also, is sadly no longer with us.
</p>

<p>
However, all is not lost, and for the last few years, an alternative
has been under very active development: GitLab. GitLab is the name
of a company—GitLab, Inc.—and the name of two projects: GitLab
CE and GitLab EE. GitLab EE is an open core project, comprised of the
free software CE and various additional components that are
proprietary. GitLab, Inc., is very upfront about this fact. GitLab
CE, however, is not your traditional "community edition" product where
the vast majority of features are locked away in an enterprise
version. A number of high-profile free software projects, such as
Debian, GNOME and GNU, all have GitLab CE servers of their own, and in
many cases, GitLab CE is being used to empower the projects that
previously used Savannah and GForge, giving them a new lease on life
and a new visibility that older software forges lacked.
</p>

<p>
Choosing proprietary tools and services for your free software project
ultimately sends a message to downstream developers and users of your
project that freedom of all users—developers included—is not a
priority. The free software movement started in 1983 by creating the
initial tools—an editor, a compiler, a debugger and a linker—for
free software developers to create a free operating
system. Ultimately, all free software projects are inherently
political by their very nature. As creators of software licensed in
ways that directly promote user freedom and a community of free
sharing, our efforts would be better served by tools that support
those same ideals.
</p>

<p>
So if you have the means, and the need, please run your own copy of
GitLab CE for your project. If you can, open it up to the wider Free
Software community and allow all free software projects to use
infrastructure that respects the freedom of all users. GNU, Debian and
GNOME have done it. Who's next? 
</p>

<p>
Oh, and let's get GitLab CE bug #4013
figured out soon, please.
