I bought a book a few years back titled, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Installing Linux on a
Dead Badger</em></span> by Lucy Snyder. When I see that book on my bookshelf, it still
makes me chuckle. And although a dead badger is certainly not a common
operating system platform, it seems like Linux continues to end up on more
and more hardware every year. Often those devices are tiny, but sometimes
those devices are giant clusters of computers that crunch trillions of
numbers a second. And of course, some of the tiniest installations end up
having the biggest effects (smartphones, for instance). This month's issue is a
reminder of just how well our favorite operating system has infiltrated our
lives.
</p><p>
We start with Reuven M. Lerner continuing his theme of computer-based
learning. Many of you probably remember the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sesame
Street</em></span> game Grover played with viewers
called &ldquo;One of These Things Is Not Like the Others&rdquo;. In a
similar vein, Reuven shows how
you can teach a bit of software how to play that game as it pertains to sets
of data. Rather than just chopping off the highs and lows in a set of data,
computer learning can determine what data is actually out of place.
</p><p>
Dave Taylor follows with some really awesome scripting. If you've ever
spent time mindlessly browsing YouTube, you've probably liked a video so
much at one point that you wanted a local copy. Or, perhaps you've wished you could
strip the audio off a YouTube video and play it on your sound system. Dave
describes a really cool tool for extracting audio and video from YouTube
URLs. Google might not be thrilled at the idea of downloading copies of
videos, but once again, Linux saves the day.
</p><p>
Speaking of saving the day, Kyle Rankin continues his series on systems
administration. This month, he helps define the various levels and titles
of administrative abilities. Ever wonder if you qualify as a junior systems
administrator or a senior systems administrator? Kyle helps explain what
the various titles mean, which is invaluable if you're applying for a
job or planning to hire more help. Even if your interests don't lie in
administration, the information is critical for anyone in IT to understand.
</p><p>
I did a little bit of investigating this month. Specifically, I investigated
my network trying to track down some rogue traffic on my router. I learned
a lot along the way, and in the end, I had a face-palm moment. Nevertheless, I
figured all the network monitoring and investigative knowledge made it
worthwhile. If you're uncertain what is happening on your local network, I
encourage you to read my column. 
</p><p>
Jacques De Hooge describes another way
Linux and open source can help you determine what is going on, specifically
what's going on in your chest. Using various open-source tools, along with a few
proprietary ones, Jacques tells how Linux helps create 3D models of the
heart for diagnoses. It's a perfect example of Linux quietly making the
world go round, and it's also really cool to learn about!
</p><p>
We finish off the issue with the first part of a series on building a
computer cluster using Linux. Nathan R. Vance, Michael L. Poublon and
William F. Polik join forces to teach how to create an appropriate
cluster from beginning to end. Whether you want to build your own cluster,
or just want to learn about the technology, it's an awesome series that we're
starting this month. 
</p><p>
We also have the normal collection of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>
goodies, including tech tips, new product announcements and UpFront
oddities from around the internet. Whether you love Linux because of all
the tiny places in can be installed or think it's awesome that Linux
powers the internet, this issue should tickle your fancy all the same.
