EOF January 2017</h4><p>
I have been an avid and loyal <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> subscriber for 20 years.
But after reading Doc Searls' January 2017 EOF, I am thoroughly disgusted. I will
not be renewing. Politics has no place in a magazine such as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>.
If I wanted someone's political opinion, I'd turn on MSNBC or CNN.
The arrogance displayed by publishing that article is astounding.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Doug
 McComber  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc Searls replies:</b></span> Thanks for writing.
And for debugging mine.
</p><p>
Under similar criticisms in the web version of the column, I wrote this
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/debugging-democracy#comment-3099071559" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/debugging-democracy#comment-3099071559</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
fulp01 isn't a troll. He's a subscriber, and we value those.
</p><p>
He's also right to call me to task. Judging from the almost entirely negative response
this column has received so far, I was the one doing the trolling, though that wasn't
my intent.
</p><p>
Calling Trump a troll also distracted readers from my main point, which is that
journalism is suffering in a world where a business based on surveillance is
programmatically dividing people into mutually hostile echo chambers, which makes
democracy suffer as well. And that, because this whole echo-system is programmatic, and
to a high degree runs on Linux-based infrastructure, we (or at least some of us) are in
a position to help fix it.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
I also wrote a similar response for the magazine, and something like it in
my March 2017
column. Hope those help, and that you stay with us.

Open-Source Classroom&mdash;Passwords, Security Questions</h4><p>
Regarding Shawn Powers' &ldquo;All Your Accounts Are Belong to Us&rdquo;
article in the February 2017 issue: good information regarding passwords
and 2nd-factor authentication,
etc. One thing I've done for the last ten years or so is create fictitious
alternative personal data that is used for online accounts&mdash;things like
birthday, mother's maiden name, high school teacher, first car and so on. I only
use my real personal data when it must be done, like for banking or
government stuff. I store my alternative personal information in my password
manager so I don't have to remember it. This way, if any of my social media
or other online accounts ever do have a breach, the data that is leaked
can't be used as identification verification by a bad actor or as a pivot
point to get into other accounts. The key is being consistent. Regarding
password managers, since I don't trust any third party, my password manager
is a strongly encrypted text file that is synced via Dropbox with a very
strong high entropy password that I've committed to memory. One more thing,
regarding using fingerprints and other biometrics to log on, keep in mind that
you can be compelled to place your finger (or have retina scan) to
unlock your device, but courts (so far) have upheld the divulging of
passwords as &ldquo;something you know&rdquo; and hence is under 5th Amendment
protection.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Mark
 Dean  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Shawn Powers replies:</b></span> That's all really good
information, and I've considered the alternate persona thing as well.
Having security questions for password recovery just seems like a bad idea, since
most of the questions are fairly easy to figure out, especially if you know
the person. My bank, for example, asks, &ldquo;Where were you
born?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Who's your favorite
singer?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Who's your favorite author&rdquo;, which are all things widely known to
anyone who knows me even online.
</p><p>
You're also correct about the biometrics. They're not a great way to secure
a phone, but they do offer a convenience factor that in some cases I deem worth
the downside. Thankfully, some apps require multiple authentication
factors. Copay, my Bitcoin wallet, for instance, can be forced to require a
password and biometrics. Anyway, I think the best thing we can do as an IT
community is make sure we're educating folks who might not understand the
significance of securing their accounts and data. Often just understanding
is enough to get people to make better choices.

Politics Don't Belong in Technical Publications</h4><p>
I respect that this is your publication, but as a customer, I wanted to let
you know my opinion and intent should the political rants continue. I don't
read this publication to learn about opinions of Trump, the electoral
college or the Clintons. I subscribe and pay for Linux-related news and
information. Simply put, if the political overtones continue, I'll save
myself the subscription cost, browse to Fox news or CNN, and not read this
publication in the future.
</p><p>
Thank you for your consideration, and I hope to see less word count about
politics and more interesting content about Linux.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
G.
 Powers  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc Searls replies:</b></span> Grant,
I assume you
are writing in response to my &ldquo;Debugging Democracy&rdquo; column in the January
2017 issue&mdash;the one and only time in two decades of writing for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>
that I've ever brought up politics (or at least that I remember).
</p><p>
So you know, I've already responded to similar pushback from other
readers. Here is what I wrote in response to a reader named Mark:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Mark is right. I do owe readers an apology. By calling Donald Trump a
troll (take a look at the Wikipedia definition of Internet troll
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll</a>), and draw
your own
conclusions), I was being a troll as well. Even though trolling wasn't my
intent, that has been the effect so far: every response to my January
column, both here and on our website, has been as negative as Mark's,
and for the same reasons.
</p><p>
Opening with that remark also failed to support the main purpose of that
column, which was to call for help in rescuing journalism&mdash;and real
journals such as this one&mdash;from drowning in a sea of
&ldquo;content&rdquo;,
way too much of which is crap routed by algorithms aimed by
surveillance-gathered data into echo chambers of the like-minded. This has
the effect of increasing enmity and blame toward those in echo chambers
with opposing sympathies, which is worse than dangerous in democratic
societies, because it tears apart the center spaces of basic agreement
those societies require. You can see how this looks in <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Wall Street
Journal</em></span>'s Blue Feed, Red Feed site
(<a href="http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed" target="_self">graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed</a>), subtitled
&ldquo;See Liberal
Facebook and Conservative Facebook, Side by Side&rdquo;.
</p><p>
I am sure most of the systems driving us into hostile camps are built on
Linux. (Isn't everything now?) So I don't think I'm off base
calling for help here.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
I believe that was published (with Mark's letter) in the March 2017 issue.
</p><p>
I hope this addresses your concerns. If not, let us know.

Doc Searls' Columns</h4><p>
I hope this note finds you well and enjoying the riches of all things
Linux!
</p><p>
This is just a short note of appreciation for Doc Searls and his monthly
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> columns. I suspect some readers are occasionally puzzled
about the nature of those columns&mdash;they're not exactly technical
&ldquo;how-to&rdquo;
sorts of things.
</p><p>
I think it's important to keep in mind the global picture, and I'm glad that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> sees fit to give voice to such important issues. It would be simple to
take the low road and just keep to the geek stuff. Thanks for continuing to
take the high road!

Linux Desktop Use Case (from De Bortoli Wines, Australia)</h4><p>
Reaching out to Doc Searls as a recent article of his lamented the state of
the Linux
Desktop. I thought you might be interested in connecting with a company
with Linux as the default desktop&mdash;since 2004!
</p><p>
&lt;&lt;** Warning&mdash;shameless propaganda ahead! **&gt;&gt;

Doc Searls and Content</h4><p>
Regarding Doc Searls' &ldquo;The Problem with 'Content'&rdquo; in the
March 2017 issue: nice editorial, but I think you are missing another facet of what
happened to the &ldquo;media&rdquo; out there&mdash;namely that of partial news.
</p><p>
I used to read a lot of newspapers when I was younger. Over time, it
became impossible to ignore a certain bias in most media outlets'
reporting. And as time went on, it became more and more difficult to
keep <span   class="emphasis"><em>paying</em></span> for such reporting.
</p><p>
One needs to look no further than the hyperventilating meltdown that
the &ldquo;media&rdquo; has suffered under President Trump to understand that
reporters have intentionally left about half of the population behind.
Certainly other factors are at play, but I'm certain things wouldn't
be quite as bad as they are if the &ldquo;media&rdquo; had not alienated half of
its potential readership.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Aki
 Korhonen  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc Searls replies:</b></span> Thanks, Aki. Good points.
</p><p>
I think all news is partial, in at least two meanings of the word: it's
both incomplete and biased in some way. I also think the internet has
utterly changed all the old media outlets by supporting countless new ones,
while social media on the net has driven coverage and conversation into
echo-systems that not only don't talk with each other, but distrust and
dislike each other more and more, as they get fed one-sided
&ldquo;content&rdquo;, because that's what algorithms send to them. As I
mentioned previously, to see
this at work, check out <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></span>'s
&ldquo;Blue Feed/Red Feed&rdquo;:
<a href="http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed" target="_self">graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed</a>. Kinda scary. In the old media
world, there was common ground. In the new one, it's pretty much gone.
</p><p>
I agree that big-name big-city papers and broadcasters ignored much of the
country, roughly since Bush the Elder, which is why many people in those
places feel left behind. But other media came in and served those people,
who not only just elected a president they prefer, but also gave the GOP a
majority in both houses of Congress. Hit SCAN on your radio, even in major
markets, and most of the non-sports talk you'll hear is hard right.
When I'm in red states, it seems like every establishment that has TVs
for patrons (even hospital waiting rooms) is playing Fox News.
</p><p>
At this point, however, both of the old media sides are in trouble, because
the internet isn't just changing every media game; it's inviting
many new ones, most of which we haven't seen yet.

Shotcut</h4><p>
I'd love for you to review Shotcut video editor. I recently used it
to edit ~30 hours of old VHS tapes that were digitally captured into
about ten hours to play in a loop on an RPi2 running Kodi as
background/icebreaker for a 25th reunion party. It got people talking
and reminiscing, and was a great success.
</p><p>
I found parts of the UI clunky, and some of the default timeline
behaviors when cutting were less than helpful, but it never crashed.
It did lock up once while rendering for some mysterious reason, but I
just killed it and restarted it with the saved *.xml project file.
</p><p>
I was impressed. The best thing is it's totally self-contained&mdash;just
unzip the archive, run the supplied startup script, and off you go.
No dependency headaches! All Linux software should aspire to this!

 B. Kulecz  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Shawn Powers replies:</b></span> Thanks for the heads
up. I've never tried Shotcut, but I'll give it a
whirl. I'll try to write up a review as well, depending on how my
experience goes.
