We chose open-source tools for their superior quality, not because
they're free. It turned out we needed some closed source tools as well.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x108a580.0x11821f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Heart diseases are common all over the world. They lower life expectancy
and quality, and weigh heavily upon healthcare budgets. At the HAGA
teaching hospital in The Hague, we're developing a software package named
Sculptor, which allows detailed localization of heart problems while
avoiding
exploratory surgery. Development took us along a path that involved both
Linux and Windows. I share our experiences in this article.
</p><p>
Apart from being a pump, the heart is a current generator. To find out
what's wrong with it, a cardiologist needs a 3D image of its electrical
behavior. To obtain this image from skin electrodes, we had to turn
around the path traveled by the electrical signals from heart to body
surface. This &ldquo;inverse problem&rdquo;, as mathematicians call it,
requires
solving a set of equations that have been known since the time of Faraday.
</p><p>
On their way to the body surface, the electrical signals undergo the
influence of the organs they meet. Until
recently, it was hard to
visualize this influence, but with the availability of more and more
computing power on the desktop, it is possible to generate a 3D map
that exactly shows how the lungs, the spine and the chest bone bend the
electrical currents. To trace the signal path, we overlay a 3D
grid on the
heart, using the splendid GMSH open-source package that has been under
development for many years.
</p><p>
We then apply a mathematical trick we took
from construction engineering to solve the equations. Fenics-Dolphin,
another great open-source package developed in an international
cooperation of four universities, helps achieve this feat. Both
packages are part of some Linux distributions, and they can be installed
on others easily.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12136f1.large.jpg"><img src="12136f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
To fine-tune our equations, we also needed a method to guide the flow of
electrical currents inside the heart itself. For this, we use a combination
of two algorithms, both of which are open source. To keep the electric
currents inside the conductive parts of the heart, we use a gem from
the computer game industry: the Moeller-Trumbore triangle intersection
algorithm. To make sure the electrical signals travel straight to their
targets, we use another popular recipe, although few know its name: the
Floyd-Warshall shortest path algorithm. This algorithm and its cousin,
the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm, are routinely used in car navigation
systems. So, no rocket science.
</p><p>
Algorithms, algorithms, algorithms&mdash;fast, well documented, resulting
from years of dedicated research work, with implementations available for
free on Linux&mdash;we felt like kids in a candy shop. Why write anything
ourselves? It looked like open source had all we needed. The
main thing we had to do was tie it together, which, we thought, would be
simple. But, it wasn't. We had underestimated this hidden booby trap of
software engineering: accumulated complexity. We had pieces of knitted
Matlab code, featuring fuzzy module boundaries and cryptic one-letter
variable names. We had lumps of archaic Kernighan and Ritchie C code,
littered with macros. We even had some well conserved Fortran IV code,
shouting at us in all capitals. Call sequences, memory models and tool
versions to compile the whole bunch were all incompatible.
</p><p>
In short, we had a set of beautiful Christmas balls, but how to hang them
on one single tree&mdash;that was the question. Early attempts had used a
lot
of messy glue code, and our first task was to scrape the glue off the
balls and give them all the same hooks: a clean interface. Matlab, Fortran
and C balls were all converted to C++, sticking to the solid concepts
of object orientation: encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism,
but avoiding the jungle of template- and overload resolution.
</p><p>
Oh yes, and there was this one ball we didn't yet have: we needed a simple,
static 3D model of the heart tissue to allow for computing our currents. None
of the many research articles we read had paid any attention to this
step, so we assumed it was trivial and that something like Blender could be
used. Not so.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x108a580.0x1182880"></a>
Will It Still Be Here Next Year?</h2></div></div><p>
As it turned out, drawing up a 3D static model of the heart wasn't simple
at all. We tried Blender and at least a dozen things, but they all failed
at the task. The reason is that they were not made for computation but
for visualization, typically involving steps like smoothing to make
things look nice.
</p><p>
As I am writing this, I am sitting behind a steel desk, my bare wrists
resting upon the surface. On my desk, there's a lamp with a power cord,
running over the edge to a wall outlet. Now suppose I want to draw up a
3D model of that desk, including the lamp and the power cord. The model
is built out of tiny triangles and is smoothed to look
good, with tiny gaps puttied automatically. For visualization, this model
is great. But unfortunately, the smoothing closed one gap too many: the
tiny gap between the copper core of the power cord and the edge of my
desk, originally separated by a tenth of an inch of plastic insulator
material. From an aesthetic point of view, my model is great. But from
an electrical point of view, it's completely worthless. The distinction
between typing quietly and being subjected to the full power-grid voltage
on my wrists is what scientists would call &ldquo;a significant
difference&rdquo;.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12136f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
What this meant for us is that, although tools like Blender give
nice-looking results, they only rarely produce something accurate enough
for simulation of electrical behavior. There are many (open-source,
you guessed it) tools to repair small defects in 3D models, and we spent
at least two months trying them in every possible combination. In the
end, we had to admit total failure, and we concluded that we had to
make this Christmas ball ourselves. We decided
upon Python, NumPy and
OpenGL to do it. To be able to read images generated by an MRI scanner,
we needed another open-source package called PyDicom.
</p><p>
By now our software depended upon a large number of open-source
components, some of them mainstream, some of them less so. Having
installed several versions of Ubuntu on a diversity of hardware in the
course of the project, something else became clear: although kernel
versions
followed a single upward-bound track, Linux distributions as a whole were
more like a grab bag filled by a drunken Santa Claus. Sometimes basic
tools were completely lacking; sometimes several incompatible versions
were on the same distribution.
</p><p>
We spent quite some time composing our
own &ldquo;standard distribution&rdquo; on one of our machines, and we
were nearly
there when we decided to replace Python 2.7 with the Conda Python 3.5
distribution, which includes OpenGL, Numpy and even PyDicom. As Python
2.7 kept popping up at unexpected moments, we uninstalled it...which
left us with a Linux that could just barely bring up a command-line
console. Since installing everything properly had taken so much time,
we attempted to repair our installation, spending hours reading about
the adventures of other developers as laid down on Stack Overflow. In
the end, we had to give up. Simply uninstalling a development tool turned
out to have wrecked our OS beyond repair by mere mortals.
</p><p>
That wasn't all bad. We decided to grab the opportunity to make the
move from Ubuntu 12 to Ubuntu 14, which had newer versions of nearly
everything we needed&mdash;yet another mistake. Fenics-Dolphin turned out
to
depend on Python 2.7, which it couldn't find, since it wasn't the default
anymore. The GCC C++ compiler had become more picky and refused several
constructs for reasons that we have yet to understand. CLang was said
to be the solution, and indeed, it was better at some points, but worse
at others.
</p><p>
To cut a long story short, we had poured months into development
of software that we planned to use for five to ten years at least,
but installing a new Linux version after only a year left us with a
dysfunctional system that was near to impossible to repair. What to expect
in three years? Or six? With regard to every component we used, we had to
pose one serious question: will it still be here next year? After reading
through many blogs about life-cycle policies, we finally came up with a
clear conclusion: 1) We don't know. 2) Nobody knows. It's hard to base
a multi-year investment decision on that. Choosing to stay with a fixed
set of legacy tools eventually would cut us off from new developments,
which in the case of research, isn't an option. Using state-of-the-art
tools
would cripple our system over and over again.
</p><p>
The only viable path out of this dilemma was to
start with a very bare-bones Linux and follow a rigid script to install
exactly everything we
wanted in exactly the right order, manually accounting for uncharted
dependencies. In the end, it worked out. We now can install the
newest
version of everything we need on any system capable of running it. But
the illusion that Linux is a kind of prepackaged development paradise
fell to pieces. We all love Linux, and we know we aren't full-time
system administrators. But surely the Linux world could benefit from
some unification and clear policies in this area.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x108a580.0x1182f08"></a>
The Right Tool for the Job</h2></div></div><p>
Computations are best done on one or more Linux boxes, but physicians
are used to Windows. That's one problem we still had to solve. The other
problem was about the one missing Christmas ball: obtaining an accurate
static 3D model of the heart without short circuits. We embarked on
writing this missing ball, and since Windows was available on every laptop
in the hospital, we started development in the closed-source world. No
problem&mdash;Python, C++ and OpenGL were all platform-independent, so once
everything was ready, we would just recompile for Linux. We thought.
</p><p>
It took us three months to develop a fast, reliable application
to draw up the required accurate 3D models from fuzzy, misaligned
MRI scans. Obtaining a good model for each patient requires human
intervention, and since radiologists were to spend many hours using this
application, we paid attention to things like minimizing the number of
mouse clicks and allowing intuitive manipulation of the anatomical parts
that make up the heart. We could remove valves, leave out the atria or
the ventricles, look from the inside out and so on&mdash;all of this fast
and in high resolution. Doctoral researchers loved the result and spent
many hours drawing up topologically correct models of hearts of men,
women and children&mdash;a whole stock of them.

</p></div></div><p>
The disappointment indeed came when we wanted to move this ball to our
Linux Christmas tree. Suddenly our graphics were slow, memory corruption
occurred frequently, and weird striping patterns haunted our displays. We
didn't panic. This must be just a matter of getting the right drivers. We
thought. This is one area where long-standing cooperation between hardware
and software manufacturers has paid off in the Windows world. Being
able to entertain such a stable cooperation between separate industries
is one of the benefits of the contract-driven closed-source world, and
it is not to be underestimated. If you buy a Windows box, you can be
quite certain all capabilities of the graphics card are used to their
utmost. For Linux, it's different.
</p><p>
Since we already had learned enough
to doubt our capacities as system administrators, we sought specialist
help on this one. The result didn't please us. Making the most of a
state-of-the-art graphics card in Linux is often just impossible. The
drivers aren't there, or they're buggy, or they refuse to cooperate with
the Linux distro at hand&mdash;many reasons that in the end all boil down
to the same response: forget it. Oh yes, results sometimes were quite nice.
But
currently I am staring at the screen of a stereovision laptop, wirelessly
controlling a pair of NVIDIA shutter glasses. The results on Windows for
our heart models are stunning; seeing depth really makes interpretation
of disease patterns much easier. Only, after three years, we couldn't
make it run on Linux. Shame on us.
</p><p>
Since physicians prefer Windows anyhow, and in the end, our computations
will run remotely on a cluster, we decided to have the GUI part
running on Windows and the computational back end on Linux, not an
unusual combination. For synchronization, we considered dinosaurs
like CORBA and mouses like JSON, but finally settled for simple file
versioning and locking, which worked flawlessly, even over a network. For
demonstration purposes, we still wanted it all to run on one (very fast)
laptop. A dual-boot system was no help; we needed Linux and Windows
to cooperate, running simultaneously. VMware Player made it possible,
and finally, we had the system of our dreams: razor-sharp visualization
with stereovision capabilities under Windows, open-source computational
tools running efficiently on a quad core under Linux on the same machine
and standardization on two mainstream, highly complementary languages:
C++ for fast execution and Python for fast development. I dare say we
were pleased with the result. The next step was scaling up our research.

Deployment for Non-Travelers</h2></div></div><p>
As the first publications were accepted by science journals, we were
open to future international cooperation. There were several candidates
inside and outside Europe. Even though we'd documented it well, our
complicated setup could become a problem. The Netherlands are small,
and if someone has an installation problem that can't be solved using
a remote desktop, it's at most a short drive to provide personal
assistance. Reliably deploying and supporting a setup over the borders
is an entirely different matter. This made us think about thin clients
and a browser GUI. For a start, we reserved a few URLs and began to
look into security regulations for patient data.
</p><p>
Since we already had separated computation and visualization, having the
latter run in a browser seemed doable. Not without reason, we'd chosen
something ubiquitously supported like OpenGL. While getting OpenGL to
run in a browser proved simple, our interactive 3D modelling Python code
certainly wasn't. We did some experiments in JavaScript, but things like
class-based object orientation and multiple inheritance were embedded
so deeply in our thinking, that using JavaScript for this sent us back
to square number one. So we looked into some alternatives, most notably
Pythons that could run in the browser. We found several, some requiring
special browser plugins, others producing slow, bulky code, yet others
lean and mean but lacking some of the basic Python features we needed.
</p><p>
So we had to roll our own. Having such positive experiences with
open source, it seemed only logical to choose this path ourselves. We
embarked on developing an open-source Python-to-JavaScript compiler
called Transcrypt, which was able to run our graphics routines. We wanted
it to
be fast, compact and able to use any JavaScript graphics library. The
first versions uploaded to GitHub were accompanied by the warning that
the code was unfit for any serious use and might go away any moment. But,
that changed earlier than we had expected. Writing a compiler is a well
documented undertaking, and Python itself comes with an excellent parser,
so in a few months' time, we had all the functionality we ourselves
needed. Execution speed and code size matched JavaScript, and we were
quite satisfied. Since we didn't plan to go any further, we referred to
our tool as a &ldquo;Small Sane Subset&rdquo; compiler. That was when the
dynamics
of open source took over.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12136f4.large.jpg"><img src="12136f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Class-Based Object Orientation in the Browser
</p></div></div><p>
People started to notice our little compiler; they even used
it professionally, and our first GitHub stars were acquired. Feature
requests came in. Could you build in this? Could you build in that? It all
wasn't too hard, and some of the new stuff we could use ourselves. Although
Transcrypt was open source from the start, and its development decoupled
from Sculptor, it now gained momentum of its own. Some very experienced
and competent developers from all over the world made large contributions,
and people started to use it for a diversity of projects, every bit
as serious as our research. It was pure fun, and
on top of that, it took
away our last reservations about Linux in particular and open source in
general. We clearly had been drawn into something bigger than
ourselves.
</p><p>
Up to this point, we'd always wondered about reliability. Just how reliable
can anything as complex and vulnerable as an operating system be, if
it's developed in a loose cooperation of hundreds of developers that
may withdraw their support at any time? How about code quality? How about
continuity? From experience, we now can tell the answer. Let me make this
personal. For some 35 years I've been a lead developer in many
teams with many companies large and small, but I've never encountered
such craftsmanship, such dedication, such enthusiasm, such energy and
such a sense of responsibility as in the open-source world. Here's a
message to any company still shy of trying: there's a world of competent,
top-notch developers out there. Do you think you can survive without them,
creating your own proprietary world with ten, 20, 100 developers
being managed hierarchically? You don't stand a chance. It's as simple
as that.
