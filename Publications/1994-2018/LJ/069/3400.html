    A look at an easy way to figure out what those pesky IP
    addresses actually mean.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e6580.0x21de558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Some years back when I was teaching
Novell courses, I noted that many students in my TCP/IP course were
having problems understanding IP addressing. Other instructors were
seeing the same results. Although I carefully walked the students
through the material, many of them still had difficulty grasping
the concepts. Furthermore, their problem was exacerbated by having
to take the CNE tests, which were closed-book and timed. Hence,
they needed a quick and effective way of working with IP addresses.
</p><p>I fine-tuned an approach to minimize the chances for test
errors and to help them memorize and apply the principles at almost
any time, even years later. I used to give this one- to two-hour IP
presentation toward the end of the course, and it worked great.
Very few of my students failed the test.</p><p>In the last couple of years, I have been teaching at DeVry
and found the need to &ldquo;dust off&rdquo; my IP presentation. It has
worked equally well at DeVry. This article summarizes that
presentation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e6580.0x21de710"></a>Basics</h2></div></div><p>The first question concerns what constitutes a Class A, or a
Class B, etc. network. Novices have trouble remembering where each
class begins and ends. Table 3 shows a schema to help with this.
First, let's discuss some basics of binary numbers.</p><p>A byte is a grouping of eight binary bits. Since a binary bit
is either a 0 or a 1, a byte consists of eight 0s and/or 1s. No
mystery here. So 10010101 is one byte and 11100000 is another. How
do we convert these to decimal numbers? It turns out that the
right-most bit has a weight of 1 (2&lt;+&gt;0&lt;+&gt;). The next
bit to its left has a weight of 2 (2&lt;+&gt;1&lt;+&gt;), the next
has a weight of 4 (2&lt;+&gt;2&lt;+&gt;), i.e., two raised to the
second power and so on:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
2
</pre><p>or equivalently:
<pre     class="programlisting">
128  64  32  16  8  4  2  1     : decimal weights
</pre>


Thus, the binary number 10101001 has a decimal equivalent of
<pre     class="programlisting">
1x1 + 1x8 + 1x32 + 1x128 = 169
</pre>


If you assign contiguous 1s starting from the right, the above
diagram can be used as a kind of calculator. Let's say you have
00001111 binary bits. To get the decimal equivalent, you could do
the calculations the hard way, that is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
1x1 + 1x2 + 1x4 + 1x8 = 15
</pre>


or you could note the following (taking our number):
<pre     class="programlisting">
128  64  32  16  8  4  2  1     :decimal weights
  0  0  0  0  1  1  1  1 :binary number
</pre>


If you have all ones starting at the right side, you can simply
take the weight of the first 0 bit (16 in this case), subtract 1,
and you have 15&mdash;the decimal equivalent&mdash;without having to use a
calculator. Thus, if all the bits on the right are 1s, you can
determine the decimal value by using the above diagram as a kind of
calculator.
</p><p>Note that the bits go up in powers of 2, so the ninth bit has
a decimal weight of 256. So if you have a byte with all ones, i.e.,
11111111, then it has a decimal value of 255 (256 -1). 255 appears
many times in IP addressing.</p><p><a href="3400t1.html" target="_self">Table 1</a></p><p>Now we need to construct another calculator for handy
reference (see Table 1). There is a thing called netmasking, which
I will discuss later on. Standard procedure says to start the
masking from the left and work down. So, if you make the eighth, or
high-order bit, 1 and the rest equal to 0, the decimal equivalent
is 128; if you made the first three bits 1 and the rest 0, the
decimal equivalent is 224, etc.</p><p><a href="3400t2.html" target="_self">Table 2</a></p><p>This table works fine, but is a bit unwieldy. Table 2 shows a
short version. It says that if your byte is 11100000, then the
decimal equivalent value is 224. If this bothers you, just use
Table 1.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e6580.0x21dece8"></a>IP Addresses</h2></div></div><p>We have set the groundwork for IP addressing, and I will now
discuss the standard IPv4 addresses. The IP addresses are sometimes
called &ldquo;dotted quad&rdquo; numbers. There are five classes of IP
addresses, i.e., A, B, C, D and E. Classes D and E are reserved so
you can work with classes A, B and C. However, I will show all five
here. The class is determined from the first byte. Thus, an IP
address of 205.140.187.31 is a class C address, since the first
byte is 205. How do I know that? Well, let's look at Table
3.</p><p><a href="3400t3.html" target="_self">Table 3</a></p><p>How did I get Table 3? I had to remember only a couple of
pieces of information, then I constructed the rest. I know there
are five classes of IP addresses, and the first byte of the IP
address tells you to which class it belongs. I also know the schema
for the binary starting value of the first byte, i.e., 0, 10, 110,
etc. Because of the way it follows a schema, the second column is
easy to construct. Now, using Table 2, it was easy to construct the
third column.</p><p>Next, note that the fourth column (ending point) follows
naturally by simply subtracting one from the beginning of the next
class. A class C begins at 192, while a class D begins at 224.
Hence, a class C must end at 223. Now you have no excuses about
forgetting the beginning and ending points of each class; merely
remember the binary schema, and take a minute to construct the
table. On a side note, you don't have to worry about Classes D and
E, except that the beginning of Class D tells you where Class C
ends by subtracting 1.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e6580.0x21def50"></a>Bitwise AND</h2></div></div><p>We need to discuss netmasking, but first, let's digress for a
moment. A Boolean AND is just like an &ldquo;and&rdquo; in English. You tell
Johnny you will buy him an ice cream cone if he puts out the trash
&ldquo;and&rdquo; makes his bed. If he does neither or only one of them, he
doesn't get an ice cream cone. If he does both, he gets the
cone.</p><p><a href="3400t4.html" target="_self">Table 4</a></p><p>Bitwise ANDs work bit by bit. So, if you AND a 1 with a 1,
you get a 1. If you AND two 0s, a 1 and a 0, or a 0 and a 1,
however, you get a 0. Table 4 illustrates this operation.</p><p>Now let's take a whole byte and do a Logical AND with another
byte. Suppose the first byte is 10110010 and the second byte is
01100111. Working from the right, note that the first byte has a
decimal value of</p><pre     class="programlisting">
0*1 + 1*2 + 0*4 + 0*8 + 1*16 + 1*32 + 0*64 + 1*128 = 178
</pre><p>while the second byte has a decimal value of
<pre     class="programlisting">
1*1 + 1*2 + 1*4 + 0*8 + 0*16 + 1*32 + 1*64 + 0*128 = 103.
</pre>


Now, AND the two bytes:
<pre     class="programlisting">
1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0         178 decimal, ANDed with
0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1         103 decimal
---------------             gives
0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0         34 decimal
</pre>


As a second example, let's AND 178 with 255.
<pre     class="programlisting">
1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0         178 decimal, ANDed with
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1         255 decimal
---------------             gives
1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0         178 decimal
</pre>


We know, then, that when you bit-wise AND any byte (number) with
255, you get the number dropping through, i.e., the result is
merely the number again.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e6580.0x21df370"></a>Netmasking</h2></div></div><p>The default netmasks for the various classes are shown in
Table 5 with some sample host IP addresses. Simply put, a host is
anything that has an IP address. This includes servers,
workstations, routers, etc.</p><p><a href="3400t5.html" target="_self">Table 5</a></p><p>So, what does this mean and what do we do with it? Let's work
through Table 5. If we take the sample Class A address, 10.0.1.23
and bit-wise AND it with its default netmask, we obtain 10.0.0.0.
What is 10.0.0.0? It's the network address&mdash;look at the last
column.</p><p>Notice that the first byte gives the network address when
ANDing a Class A network with its default netmask, while the first
two bytes give the network address when ANDing a Class B IP address
with the default Class B netmask. Hence, we say that the first byte
of a Class A IP address gives the network address, and the three
remaining bytes give the host addresses, i.e., a Class A address
has the form N.H.H.H where N stands for Network and H stands for
Host. Likewise, the first two bytes of a Class B IP address pertain
to the network, and the last two bytes pertain to the host address,
i.e., N.N.H.H. Finally, the first three bytes of a Class C IP
address pertain to the network, while the last byte pertains to the
host, i.e., N.N.N.H.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e6580.0x21df5d8"></a>Subnetting</h2></div></div><p>Let's illustrate this with a Class B IP address such as
142.168.25.100. From Table 5, we know that the default netmask for
a Class B network is 255.255.0.0. Hence, ANDing the default mask
with the IP address yields the address of the network that
particular host is on, i.e., 142.168.0.0. So, a host with an IP
address of 142.168.25.100 finds itself on a network with an IP
address of 142.168.0.0 if a default Class B net-mask is
used.</p><p>If you are granted a full Class B suite of addresses with a
network address of 142.168.0.0, what do you do with them? Remember,
a Class B network has the form of N.N.H.H, i.e., the last two bytes
can be used for assigning host IP addresses. This yields a network
with 2&lt;+&gt;16&lt;+&gt; - 2 host addresses. The -2 comes from
the fact that 142.168.0.0 is the network address, so it can't be
assigned to a host; the last address on the network,
142.168.255.255, is used for broadcasts, so it also can't be
assigned to a host.</p><p>This would be a very big network (65,534 host addresses), far
too big to be practical. A very simple approach is to &ldquo;borrow&rdquo;
one byte's worth of host addresses and assign them as network
addresses. That would yield 2&lt;+&gt;8&lt;+&gt; = 256 networks
with 254 hosts on each. Even here, these are large networks. This
process of borrowing host addresses and using them for networks is
called subnetting. We accomplish this by using a sub-netmask (SNM).
In this case, we would use a sub-netmask of 255.255.255.0, which is
the default Class C netmask. Hence, we have taken one Class B
network and turned it into 256 Class C networks.</p><p>If we AND 142.168.25.100 with 255.255.255.0, we get a network
address of 142.168.25.0 with the first available host address of
142.168.25.1 and the last of 142.168.25.254, since 142.168.25.255
is reserved for broadcasts. Another way of doing this is to start
with the network address (142.168.25.0 in this case), turn all host
bits into 1s, and obtain the broadcast address. Here, the last byte
is used for host addresses, so turning them to ones gives
142.168.25.255. This type of broadcast is called a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>directed broadcast</em></span>, meaning that it jumps
routers while a local broadcast (which doesn't jump routers) has
the form 255.255.255.255 no matter which class of network is
involved.</p><p>If you're not too stunned at this point, you may wonder if
you can subnet only on byte boundaries or if you can subnet a Class
C network. The answers are &ldquo;no&rdquo; and &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, respectively; i.e.,
you can work in the middle of a byte.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e6580.0x21df898"></a>Subnetting on Non-Byte Boundaries</h2></div></div><p>Let's say you are granted a full Class C suite of addresses,
e.g., 210.168.94.0 as your network address. You are allowed to
assign the host addresses (the last byte) as you please. If you use
the default Class C netmask of 255.255.255.0 (see Table 5), you can
assign host addresses of 210.168.94.1 through 210.168.94.254 on a
single network. That's feasible of course, but you may want to
break this up into multiple networks of perhaps 25 hosts
each.</p><p>Let's do some mathematics. If we have 4 bits for hosts, will
it be enough? 2&lt;+&gt;4&lt;+&gt;-2 = 14 and is not enough. So,
let's use 5 bits for hosts: 2&lt;+&gt;5&lt;+&gt;-2 = 30 which will
work. However, we have 8 bits in the last byte for hosts, so let's
borrow three bits for subnetworks; then we still have the requisite
5 bits for hosts. Great, but how many subnets do we have? How about
2&lt;+&gt;3&lt;+&gt; = 8? We have, then, eight subnetworks with 30
host addresses on each. If you are doing the math, you are probably
saying, &ldquo;but 8x30 is only 240 addresses; what happened to the
others?&rdquo; Valid question! Oops, don't get sore, but it's time to
construct another table. Note that each address will have the form
of 210.168.94.<span   class="emphasis"><em>last byte</em></span>, and the SNM
(sub-netmask) will have the form 255.255.255.<span   class="emphasis"><em>last
byte</em></span>. Let's just work with the last byte.</p><p><a href="3400t6.html" target="_self">Table 6</a></p><p>From Table 2 (or Table 1), we see the SNM will be
255.255.255.224. The 224 comes from the last byte being 11100000.
So what are the subnets? Table 6 shows them (last byte
only).</p><p>Let's detail a few. First, take the smallest. The full
subnetwork address of the smallest is 210.168.94.0. The next one up
is 210.168.94.32, and so on. Remember that with three bits to work
with, we get 2&lt;+&gt;3&lt;+&gt; = 8 subnets, and looking at Table
6, you see them.</p><p><a href="3400t7.html" target="_self">Table 7</a></p><p>Back to the question of why we get only 240 host addresses.
&ldquo;(Gasp)&mdash;another table!&rdquo; Looking at the last byte, we get Table
7.</p><p>Now let's answer the question of what happened to the other
addresses. To do this, tally all the &ldquo;invalid addresses&rdquo;, i.e.,
those that can't be used for host addresses.</p><p>First, we have eight subnets, each with a subnetwork address
and a broadcast address. So we lose 8*2 = 16 addresses here. Now if
we subtract these 16 from 256, we get 240 available host
addresses.</p><p>Doing it the other way is much easier. We have eight
subnetworks, each with 30 valid IP addresses; this gives us
8*30=240 valid IP addresses total, the magic number.</p><p>For fun, let's do one more thing: analyze the sixth
subnetwork in a little more detail. The last byte is 10100000
binary or 160 decimal. The full subnet address is 210.168.94.160
decimal, and we use an SNM of 255.255.255.224. Remember, I said to
take the subnet address, set all the host bits to 1s and add them
to get the broadcast address. If we do this correctly, it should
give the same result as Table 7.</p><p>We use five bits for host addresses, so the decimal value of
the sixth bit is 32. Subtracting 1 gives 31. Thus, setting the five
host bits to 1s, i.e., 00011111, gives a value of 31 decimal.
Adding this to the last byte of the subnet address (160) gives 191
for the broadcast address, agreeing with Table 7. Here is the
&ldquo;whole Megillah&rdquo;:</p><p>210.168.94.160 The Sub-Network address210.168.94.161-190
Valid host addresses210.168.94.191 Directed Broadcast
address</p><p>One final point. Some authors use the term &ldquo;sub-netmask&rdquo;
even when referring to the default netmasks&mdash;they are being just a
tad loose with their terms. Happy IP addressing, and remember,
Linux is inevitable.</p></div></div>
