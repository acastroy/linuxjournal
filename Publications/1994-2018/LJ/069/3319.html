    This article will introduce you to RPM by showing you the
    most common features, namely how to query, install, upgrade
    and remove packages.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188f580.0x19874a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of the mundane yet necessary duties a
system administrator faces is software management. Applications and
patches come and go. After months or years of adding, upgrading and
removing software applications, it's often hard to tell just what
is on a system: the version of a software package and its dependent
applications. Often, old files wind up lying around, because no
one's quite sure anymore who owns them. Worse, you may install a
new software package, only to find it has overwritten a crucial
file from a currently installed package.
</p><p>The Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) was designed to eliminate
these problems. With RPM, software is managed in discrete
&ldquo;packages&rdquo;--a collection of the files that make up the software,
and instructions for adding, removing and upgrading those files.
RPM also makes sure you never lose configuration files by backing
up existing files before overwriting. RPM also tracks which version
of an application is currently installed on your system. While
named after Red Hat, the RPM system is also a part of Caldera
OpenLinux, SuSE and all distributions based on Red Hat, such as
Mandrake.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188f580.0x1987608"></a>What Is a Package?</h2></div></div><p>In the generic sense, a package is a container. It includes
the files needed to accomplish a certain task, such as the
binaries, configuration and documentation files in a software
application. It also includes instructions on how and where these
files should be installed and how the installation should be
accomplished. A package also includes instructions on how to
uninstall itself.</p><p>RPM packages are often identified by file name, which usually
consists of the package name, version, release and the architecture
for which it was built. For example, the package
penguin-3.26.i386.rpm indicates this is the (fictional) Penguin
Utilities package, version 3, release 26. i386 indicates it has
been compiled for the Intel architecture. Note that although this
is the conventional method of naming RPM packages, the actual
package name, version and architecture information are read from
the contents of the file by RPM, not the file name. You could
rename the file blag.rpm, but it would still install as
penguin-3.26.i386.rpm.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188f580.0x1987768"></a>What Is RPM?</h2></div></div><p>At the heart of RPM is the RPM database. This tracks where
each file in a package is located, its version and much more. The
RPM also maintains an MD5 checksum of each file. Checksums are used
to determine whether a file has been modified, which comes in handy
if you need to verify the integrity of one or more packages. The
RPM database makes adding, removing and upgrading packages easy,
because RPM knows which files to handle and where to put them. RPM
also takes care of conflicts between packages. For example, if
package X, which has already been installed, has a configuration
file called /etc/someconfig and you attempt to install a new
package Y, which wants to install the same file, RPM will manage
this conflict by backing up your previous configuration file before
the new file is written.</p><p>The workhorse of the RPM system is the program
<span   class="bold"><b>rpm</b></span>. rpm is the &ldquo;driver&rdquo;
responsible for maintaining the RPM databases. Of rpm's 10 modes of
operation, I will cover the four most common: query, install,
upgrade and remove.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188f580.0x1987920"></a>Query Mode</h2></div></div><p>One of the strengths of RPM is that, ideally, it accounts for
every system or application file on your system. Using RPM's query
mode, you can determine which packages are installed on your system
or which files belong to a particular package. This can be a big
help if you want to locate a file that belongs to a certain
package. Query mode can also be used to identify which files are in
an RPM file before you install it. This lets you see the files that
are going to be installed on your system before they are actually
written.</p><p>The <b  >-q</b> switch is used to query packages.
By itself, <b  >-q</b> will give you the version of a
specified package. If you want to see which version of the
<span   class="bold"><b>tin</b></span> newsreader you have on your
system, you would issue the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# rpm -q tin
tin-1.22-12
</pre><p>If you want to see which installed package owns a file, use
the <b  >-f</b> modifier. Here, we want to see which
package owns /etc/passwd.
<pre     class="programlisting">
# rpm -q -f /etc/passwd
setup-1.9.2-1
</pre>


Likewise, if you want to generate a list of files belonging to a
certain package, use the <b  >-l</b> modifier:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# rpm -q -l tin
/usr/bin/rtin
/usr/bin/tin
/usr/doc/tin-1.22
/usr/doc/tin-1.22/CHANGES
/usr/doc/tin-1.22/FTP
/usr/doc/tin-1.22/HACKERS
/usr/doc/tin-1.22/INSTALL
/usr/doc/tin-1.22/INSTALL.NNTP
/usr/doc/tin-1.22/MANIFEST
/usr/doc/tin-1.22/README
/usr/doc/tin-1.22/TODO
/usr/man/man1/tin.1
</pre>


One of the most common modifiers to <b  >-q</b> is
<b  >-a</b>, query all packages on your system. This
system has 350 packages installed, but here's a truncated output:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# rpm -q -a
setup-1.9.2-1
filesystem-1.3.2-3
basesystem-4.9-3
ldconfig-1.9.5-8
...
code_crusader-1.1.0-1
lyx-0.11.53-1
xforms-0.86-1
wine-981211-1
</pre>


<a href="3319l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>
</p><p>For even more information about a package, use the
<b  >-i</b> (information) modifier:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# rpm -q -i passwd
</pre><p>Output is shown in Listing 1. Here's what some of the most
important entries mean:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >Name</b>: the name of the
package</p></li><li><p><b  >Version</b>: the version of the
package</p></li><li><p><b  >Release</b>: the number of times
this package has been released using the same version of the
software</p></li><li><p><b  >Install date</b>: when this package
was installed on your system</p></li><li><p><b  >Group</b>: your RPM database is
divided into groups, which describe the functionality of the
software. Each time you install a package, it will be grouped
accordingly.</p></li><li><p><b  >Size</b>: the total size in bytes of
all the files in the package</p></li><li><p><b  >License</b>: the license of the
original software</p></li></ul></div>

Typically, the file name will indicate what's inside the package,
but not always. You may receive a package simply named glibc.rpm,
which isn't very helpful. You can use the <b  >-p</b>
modifier to find out which version and release this RPM contains,
then perhaps rename it appropriately.
<pre     class="programlisting">
# rpm -q -p glibc.rpm
glibc-2.0.7-29
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188f580.0x1988898"></a>Install Mode</h2></div></div><p>The install mode, as its name suggests, is used to install
RPM packages onto your system. Installing a package is accomplished
with the <b  >-i</b> option:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# rpm -i penguin-3.26.i386.rpm
</pre><p>Before installing the package, RPM performs several checks.
First, it makes sure the package you are trying to install isn't
already installed. RPM won't let you install a package on top of
itself. It also checks that you are not installing an older version
of the package. Next, RPM does a dependency check. Some packages
depend on other packages being installed first. In this example,
you have just downloaded the latest RPM version of Penguin
utilities and now want to install it.
<pre     class="programlisting">
# rpm -i penguin-3.26.i386.rpm
failed dependencies:
iceberg &gt;= 7.1 is needed by penguin-3.26.i386.rpm
</pre>


This error indicates the penguin package failed to install because
it requires the iceberg package with a version equal to or greater
than 7.1. You'll have to find and install the iceberg package, and
any packages iceberg requires.
</p><p>Finally, RPM checks to see if any configuration files would
be overwritten by the installation of this package. RPM tries to
make intelligent decisions about what to do with conflicts. If RPM
replaces an existing configuration file with one from the new
package, a warning will be printed to the screen.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# rpm -I penguin-3.26.i386.rpm
warning: /etc/someconfig saved as /etc/someconfig.rpmsave
</pre><p>It's up to you to look at both files and determine what
modifications, if any, need to be made.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188f580.0x1988c08"></a>Upgrade Mode</h2></div></div><p>The <b  >-u</b> switch is used to upgrade existing
packages. For example, if Penguin Utilities version 3.25 is already
installed, issuing the command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# rpm -u penguin-3.26.i386.rpm
</pre><p>will replace the old version of the package with the new one.
In fact, one of the quirks of RPM's upgrade mode is that the older
package doesn't have to exist in the first place:
<b  >-u</b> works identically to <b  >-i</b> in
this case.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188f580.0x1d81118"></a>Remove Mode</h2></div></div><p>The <b  >rpm -e</b> command removes a package from
your system. Like Install mode, RPM does some housekeeping before
it will let you remove a package. First, it does a dependency check
to make sure no other packages depend on the package you are
removing. If you have modified any of the configuration files, RPM
makes a copy of the file, appends .rpmsave onto the end of it, then
erases the original. Finally, after removing all files from your
system and the RPM database, it removes the package name from the
database.</p><p>Be very careful about which packages you remove from your
system. Like most Linux utilities, RPM assumes omniscience and will
silently let you shoot yourself in the foot. Removing the passwd or
kernel package would be devastating.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188f580.0x1d812d0"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>This has been a basic introduction to the idea of packages
and basic package management. You should now have a fairly good
idea of how to query, install, upgrade and remove packages from
your Linux system.</p></div></div>
