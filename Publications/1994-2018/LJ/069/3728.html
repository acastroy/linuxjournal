    Wondering about the latest version of BIND? Wonder no more.
    Mr. Harari is back this month to tell us all about it.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb51580.0xc495b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Many new features have been compiled into
the new version of BIND (Berkeley Internet name daemon), including
security bug fixes and several major changes that give the network
administrator the needed tools and configuration options to achieve
essential tasks unavailable in earlier versions of BIND.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb51580.0xc496b8"></a>Configuration Syntax</h2></div></div><p>The first thing we need to know is that a few of the terms
were changed. There are no more primary servers or secondary
servers; these two terms have been replaced with master server and
slave server.</p><p>The first major difference you will notice in BIND 8 is the
configuration file syntax is completely different. This is
confusing at the beginning. Until you learn the correct syntax and
features, you may use a Perl script that converts from the old
style /etc/named.boot file to the new style /etc/named.conf file.
Please note that these file names are the default configuration
file names for BIND 4 and BIND 8.</p><p><a href="3728l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>The BIND 8 configuration file syntax has a modular style.
Each and every section is surrounded by &ldquo;{ }&rdquo; and each line is
terminated with a &ldquo;;&rdquo;. Each zone has its own section in the
configuration file. Listing 1 is an example of a very simple
configuration file.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb51580.0xc49920"></a>Files and Utilities Location</h2></div></div><p>With BIND 8, it is possible to change the location of some
named files, such as named.pid, named.stats, named-xfer and a few
others, with the following statement in the options section of the
configuration file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
options {
   named-xfer "/
   };
</pre><p>This example changes the location of the command executed
when the name server wants to make a zone transfer.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb51580.0xc49ad8"></a>Name Checking</h2></div></div><p>BIND 8 also checks the host names in its databases. It checks
for conformance to RFC 952. If there is a host name in the zone
database which does not conform to the RFC, BIND 8 will consider
this zone to have a syntax error and will not load it. This can
cause problems for people who are upgrading from earlier versions
of BIND and have host names which do not conform, such as names
with underscores. If you are upgrading from an earlier version of
BIND, and don't want BIND to check the names of your hosts in the
database, you can use the following option:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
options {
             check-names master warn;
             check-names slave ignore;
             };
</pre><p>This will tell the server to send warning messages instead of
errors when &ldquo;bad names&rdquo; occur in a zone for which the server is a
master, and ignore &ldquo;bad names&rdquo; in zones for which the server is a
slave. You can also ignore bad names in the server, but this is not
a good thing to do since BIND 8 also checks names in response to
queries. If you are a master for a zone which has bad host names in
it, some Internet servers will not accept your server's replies. If
you want your server to accept replies even if the host names do
not conform with the RFC, use the following line in the options
section:
<pre     class="programlisting">
check-names response ignore;
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb51580.0xc49ce8"></a>Logs Configuration</h2></div></div><p>BIND 8, unlike older versions of BIND, gives the network
administrator full control of the logging messages it produces.
This logging does not have to go through the syslog daemon. Error,
debug and other messages can be configured to go to the syslog, to
a file or to standard error (STDERR). This is done with the help of
two things: channels and categories. A channel is configured in the
configuration file and tells the name daemon where the logged data
should go. A category tells the name daemon what kind of data
should go there. The message severity can be one or more of the
following: dynamic, debug, info, notice, warning, error and
critical.</p><p>Here is an example of a logging statement in the name daemon
configuration file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
logging {
       channel my_new_logging_channel {
       file "named.messages";
       severity dynamic;
       };
};
</pre><p>This statement tells the name server to log all current
debug-level messages in a file called &ldquo;named.messages&rdquo;. Some nice
features are available for logging, including log-file versions,
default operations, log-message format and more. You should refer
to the README file and to the documentation that comes with BIND 8
in order to fully understand how the logging statement works.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb51580.0xc49ef8"></a>Security and Privacy</h2></div></div><p>System and network administrators can now decide which
servers and hosts will query their server for each and every zone
they serve. This is done via access lists. With access lists, we
can tell the name daemon which hosts or networks can send queries
to a particular zone. Access lists are defined by a name in the
name daemon configuration file. An access list is basically a set
of IP hosts or network addresses assigned to a zone in the zone
section. An access list can be constructed from the names of other
access lists defined in the configuration file. Here is an example
of an access list:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
acl "MySlaveServers" {
            {192.168.1.1/32;};
            {192.168.2.0/24;};
            };
</pre><p>This means whenever we use the access list &ldquo;MySlaveServers&rdquo;
in the configuration file, we want to specify the host 192.168.1.1
and the network 192.168.2.0. The /32 and /24 are the number of bits
in the bit mask of the IP address. The predefined access lists in
BIND 8 are None, Any, Localhost and Localnets.
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Localhost: any of the IP addresses of this
host.</p></li><li><p>Localnets: any of the IP networks to which this
host has an attached interface.</p></li></ul></div>

After we have defined the access list, we can use this access
inside a zone section or in the options section:
<pre     class="programlisting">
zone "myzone.mydomain.name"  {
   type master;
   file "mydomain.db";
   allow-query { any; }; // This is default,
                         // But good as an example
   allow-transfer { "MySlaveServers";};
   // Others cant zone transfer ...
   };
</pre>


This configuration example gives anyone the ability to query
&ldquo;myzone.mydomain.name&rdquo;, but zone transfers can be done only from
192.168.1.1 or 192.168.2.0. We can put the access lists in the
global options section, and it will be applied to all zones
specified in the configuration file. With the
<b  >allow-query</b> statement, we can handle inside
domains even on our external DNS server; to do that, we simply need
to set up our internal zone so that only our internal networks can
query host names of that zone.
</p><p>Daemons often run with root permissions. This was also the
case with earlier versions of BIND. With BIND 8,
<span   class="bold"><b>named</b></span> can run as a different user.
It is a good idea not to run named with root permissions, for
security reasons. If someone exploits the name daemon and tells it
to run arbitrary code, then this arbitrary code should not be run
with root permissions. The best thing to do is create an account
and a group for the name daemon. The command that tells the name
daemon to run with a different UID (user ID) is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/sbin/named -u named -g namedgrp
</pre><p>This command will tell the name daemon to run with the UID of
the user &ldquo;named&rdquo; and the GID (group ID) of the group
&ldquo;namedgrp&rdquo;. We must first create this user and group. When
running named with a UID that is not root, we must ensure that the
name daemon database's permissions and ownership are set correctly.
We can change the permissions with the
<span   class="bold"><b>chmod</b></span> command, the group with
<span   class="bold"><b>chgrp</b></span> and the ownership with
<span   class="bold"><b>chown</b></span>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb51580.0xc4a580"></a>Notification Messages</h2></div></div><p>Older BIND versions used the following method to synchronize
the database between the master server and the slave server. From
time to time, the slave tries to invoke named-xfer with the correct
zone parameters and the zone database serial number. If the server
has a higher database serial number, it will give the slave its new
database and update the slave. The database polling interval is set
up by the master server inside the zone's database SOA (start of
authority) record, and it is known as the refresh-time parameter.
This can cause a big delay between updating our master server and
the time the data is available all over the Net.</p><p>BIND 8 has one more method for synchronizing zone databases
between the master and the slave servers. This method is known as
the DNS NOTIFY message. The NOTIFY message is basically a message
the master server sends to its known slaves whenever a zone's
serial number is changed. A NOTIFY message is simply a DNS QUERY
message with the opcode NOTIFY inside the message. The slave, after
getting the NOTIFY message from the server, replies to the server
with a NOTIFY response, telling the master server to stop sending
the NOTIFY to this particular slave. Then this slave can continue
to send named-xfer requests to the server in order to update the
zone information. The configuration parameter, which tells the
server whether it should or shouldn't send NOTIFY messages when the
zone database changes, is <b  >notify</b>, as seen in
this example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
zone  "my.domain.sela.co.il" {
      type master;
      file "db.mydomain";
      notify yes;
      };
</pre><p>Sometimes there are DNS slave servers in our zone which are
not registered as NS (name server) records inside our zone's
database. NOTIFY messages are sent only to those slaves that are
registered inside the zone database as NS records. If we know about
an unregistered slave server and want our master server to send a
NOTIFY message to this slave whenever the zone database changes, we
can do that with the <b  >also-notify</b> keyword in the
zone section of the name daemon configuration file.
<pre     class="programlisting">
zone  "my.domain.sela.co.il" {
                    type master;
                    file "db.mydomain";
                    notify yes;
                    also-notify 10.1.1.1;
                    };
</pre>


This configuration section tells the name daemon to notify the
registered slave servers whenever my.domain.sela.co.il is changed,
and also notify the 10.1.1.1 machine even though it is not
registered as an NS record in the my.domain.sela.co.il zone
database.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb51580.0xc4a898"></a>Dynamic Updates</h2></div></div><p>BIND 8 allows authorized hosts to send the zone master server
an UPDATE message. An UPDATE message can add, delete or change
record information in the zone's database. The machine that sends
the update message tries to find the master server for the zone
from the zone's NS records. If the message is received by a slave
server instead of the master server, the slave server should
forward the message to the master server.</p><p>Dynamic updates are a good thing for hosts which get their IP
addresses dynamically from a RARP (reverse ARP) or DHCP (dynamic
host configuration protocol) server. These hosts can send an update
message to the DNS server after they get their IP address from the
DHCP/RARP server. The new resolver library routine,
<span   class="bold"><b>ns_update</b></span>, is used by programs to
send DNS update messages to the server. BIND 8 is shipped with a
command-line utility, <span   class="bold"><b>nsupdate</b></span>,
that gives the ability to send update messages to the zone's master
server. By default, no one is allowed to dynamically update a zone;
the configuration file keyword <b  >allow-update</b>
gives the system administrator the ability to configure the hosts
which can send update messages for each zone. This update can help
DNS and WINS to live together on the same network, since WINS also
uses a dynamic-update method.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
zone  "my.domain.sela.co.il" {
                    type master;
                    file "db.my.domain";
                    allow-update { 10.1.1.1;  };
                   };
</pre><p>This example lets the host 10.1.1.1 send update messages
containing information on the my.domain.sela.co.il zone.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb51580.0xc4abb0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>BIND 8 has many nice features, some of them needed by many
network administrators. Since major security holes were discovered
in earlier versions of BIND, upgrading to BIND 8 is almost a must.
There are still stable older versions, such as 4.9 and later, but
these do not support all the functions mentioned here.</p></div></div>
