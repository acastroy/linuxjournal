    Attend business meetings and impromptu gatherings with friends without

    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a59580.0x2b51348"></a></h2></div></div><p>You walk down the hallway and go into the
design room. It's as hectic here as always; stuff is lying all over
the floor. Alex, the lead architect, is here with two other
designers, Brad and Lynn. They have been discussing the
architecture for the new project.
</p><p>&ldquo;I think we've almost got it,&rdquo; says Alex, &ldquo;take a look at
our design.&rdquo; He hands you a document, which you duly
examine.</p><p>&ldquo;Not too bad,&rdquo; you reply, &ldquo;but you might want to look at
something.&rdquo; You walk over to the whiteboard and draw out a rough
sketch. Brad sees where you're heading, grabs a marker, and adds
some components to your drawing.</p><p>Lynn notices a problem and says &ldquo;We may have some problems
implementing the security interface with that. Let me give Rachel
in security a call.&rdquo; She grabs the phone, and after a quick
conversation, tells everyone the impact the security team sees from
this implementation.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;sounds like you guys are on the right
track. I'll carry this preliminary design over to the programmers
and get a rough estimate on the time they'll need to implement
it.&rdquo; As you walk out, you notice your beeper has a message from
your secretary reminding you of a meeting at 3:00 with the division
head.</p><p>Activities like these occur in work environments every day;
however, in this scenario the individuals involved never physically
moved. In fact, one person sits down the hall from you, another
works at a remote site, and the third was at home. Yet everyone was
able to interact as though individuals, objects and documents were
physically colocated.</p><p>As computers move to take a dominant position in the
workplace and at home, the interactions between people change
significantly. Instead of gathering around a water cooler or at a
small cafe, meetings have moved to the Internet. However, with this
change of venue come certain restrictions. No longer can you read a
person's body language or infer meanings from the tone of someone's
voice. With many Internet collaboration tools, such as Internet
Relay Chat (IRC) or instant messengers, you can only interpret the
words others type.</p><p>The project on which I currently work, the Collaborative
Virtual Workspace (CVW), looks to add more meaning to
computer-based social interactions. Instead of relying solely on
spoken words, CVW adds actions, audio and video, and a more
descriptive virtual environment to social settings. Additionally,
users within the CVW environment can create and pass around various
artifacts, such as documents and pictures. This is because CVW
implements a persistent storage mechanism in conjunction with the
environment. Anything created within CVW can be saved for others to
see whenever they like.</p><p>Best of all, CVW is freely available. To further encourage
innovation in collaborative systems, The MITRE Corporation has made
CVW an open source software product. By disseminating CVW in this
manner, different communities can begin to experiment with and
understand synchronous computer-based collaboration. We believe
collaboration systems such as CVW will continue to evolve, and the
Internet community will have much to offer.</p><p>Let's look at where CVW comes from and what makes up our
virtual environment.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a59580.0x2b51768"></a>Servers</h2></div></div><p>From it's inception in 1994, CVW was built on a client-server
architecture. At the heart of the server is a MUD, Object-Oriented
(MOO) from Xerox PARC
(<a href="ftp://ftp.lambda.moo.mud.org/pub/MOO" target="_self">ftp://ftp.lambda.moo.mud.org/pub/MOO/</a>).
Once only within the domain of dungeons and dragons players, MUDs
and MOOs have progressed to incorporate numerous social settings.
Although providing a very descriptive environment, MOOs present one
challenge to the average computer user today&mdash;they are
predominantly text driven. With no fancy graphic interfaces or
elaborate designs, a user simply connects to a server using a MOO
client program or <span   class="bold"><b>telnet</b></span>, logs in
and begins interacting within the environment.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3465f1.large.jpg"><img src="3465f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Room Screenshot</p></div></div>
</p><p>One of the true strengths of a MOO server is its
extensibility. The server contains an object-oriented programming
language called &ldquo;MOO&rdquo;. Using the MOO language, programmers can
create new rooms, implement new actions, and provide various means
of interacting with others within the virtual environment. Add the
ability to allow a large number of people to connect
simultaneously, and it's easy to see why MOOs have become a popular
collaboration environment.</p><p>If you download the LambdaMOO source code and run it on your
Linux box, you'll notice not much exists in that environment by
default. Each MOO administrator must either build a new virtual
environment, or obtain the code someone else has written.</p><p>CVW's MOO server already contains the code for our virtual
environment. We have extended our MOO server in order to create a
large building, the floor plan of which displays graphically in the
client. Although this tightly couples the client to a CVW server
exclusively, it does provide a more intuitive interface for new
users. The building consists of several floors, each with seven
rooms and various other meeting places (hallway, lobby). These can
be modified to suit any group's needs.</p><p>Using a room-based metaphor provides two other distinct
advantages. First, session management can be logically partitioned.
Each room will administer the particular session requirements for
the users in that area. By having this controlled at the server
side, any clients connecting to the server do not have to configure
their audio, video or document settings to communicate with the
other users. Secondly, security can likewise be easily controlled.
As each room may implement an individual access control policy,
private meeting places can be created. Again, this provides a very
intuitive means of implementing security&mdash;if the server denies a
user access to a room, they usually understand they don't have
permission to enter that area.</p><p>In addition to the MOO server, we incorporated document
persistence into our collaboration system. This allows CVW to
encompass the role of a collaboration framework. If individuals
meet to discuss a topic, they may create documents or graphics
using whatever tools that may be available to them (document
editors, drawing programs). Using CVW, users can import these
external documents and allow others to view or edit them. Although
MOOs do allow users to create objects, these are normally simple
text documents that can't be easily exported to other external
applications. This persistence capability allows for asynchronous
collaboration&mdash;users may enter or leave the room whenever they
desire, but they would still have access to the work being
performed.</p><p>Since the addition of persistence incorporated a significant
change to a MOO environment, we implemented this functionality as a
unique server process, the Document server. This server does not
have to run on the same machine as the MOO server, but it should
have enough disk space available to store all the documents created
by the users. Storage of documents is quite simple&mdash;basically, a
flat database directory. To date this has proven sufficient, but a
large implementation of CVW may want to look to re-engineer this
process.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a59580.0x2b51d40"></a>Living in Your Own Virtual World</h2></div></div><p>The first step in creating a CVW environment is to obtain and
install the CVW MOO server and document server software. If you
browse the web site
(<a href="http://cvw.mitre.org" target="_self">http://cvw.mitre.org/</a>)
you'll find both a binary and a source build available for
downloading. I'll step through the binary release installations,
although the source releases require only a few more steps. Both
downloads include detailed documentation, so I'll only highlight
the important steps and try to point out any possible stumbling
blocks for getting the server running.</p><p>As for system requirements, the size of your CVW system
depends on the size of the virtual community you wish to build. My
Linux system contains a Pentium 300 with 64MB RAM running Red Hat
5.1 and a 2.2 kernel. Although we haven't tested this configuration
under a load, it should suffice for 40 to 50 simultaneous users at
a minimum. We have seen over 250 users simultaneously on a Sun
Ultra 2 dual-processor machine, so an appropriately configured
Linux workstation should perform likewise. Additionally, the server
running the document server process requires installation of the
Java 1.1 JRE.</p><p>During the CVW software download process, after accepting the
license agreement you'll be asked for some personal information.
MITRE is a not-for-profit organization, and as such, does not use
advertisements or sell user lists to other organizations. Our only
reason for maintaining a user list is to inform you of any changes
in the software and any other activities that might occur with the
CVW software.</p><p>To begin installation of the CVW server, download the two
binary packages, cvw-moo-server-3.2.0-x86-Linux2-libc6.tar.gz and
cvw-doc-server-3.2.0-any.tar.gz, and place them in a temporary
directory. Extracting these packages using the command
<b  >tar&nbsp;xvzf &nbsp;<i><tt>package_name</tt></i></b>
will create separate directories with the required binary files.</p><p>I decided to make /opt/CVWserver my installation directory.
Before creating this directory, create a user named &ldquo;cvw&rdquo; on your
system. This user will be the owner of the installation, so the
binary won't execute as root. Although we haven't discovered any
real problems running the software as root, this tends to be a good
rule-of-thumb. After creating the user, make your installation
directory using <span   class="bold"><b>mkdir</b></span> and assign
your cvw user as its owner.</p><p>Move the following files into your installation directory
from the moo-server binary directory&mdash;the moo executable, the
restart script and the CVW.db file. If you like, you may rename
CVW.db to something that better describes your environment. The
name you choose doesn't matter, but you need to remember it, as you
will be using it later on.</p><p>The Document server also requires a document repository. This
repository directory must be large enough to store all your
documents within CVW. Depending on your potential use, you may
create a directory under the server directory you just created or
mount a separate partition on your system. I created an
/opt/CVWserver/docstore directory since I expected to have a small
number of documents. You could also create a /docstore directory
and mount another disk to it. The route you take depends a great
deal on your projected use.</p><p>Next, the document server requires files to be installed from
the document server binary directory. Move docserver.jar,
docserver.cfg and the start-dserver script into your installation
directory. You will need to modify
<span   class="bold"><b>docserver.cfg</b></span> to point to your
document repository. Finally, change all file ownerships within the
installation directory to be owned by the cvw user.</p><p>To start the processes automatically when I boot my system,
two init scripts have been provided. These include
<span   class="bold"><b>cvw.boot</b></span> for the MOO server and
<span   class="bold"><b>cvwds.boot</b></span> for the docserver. Move
these scripts to /etc/rc.d/init.d and edit them for your personal
configuration. By default, we use 8888 as our MOO server
communication port and 8889 for the docserver; if any other
programs on your system use these ports, change the numbers in the
scripts to an unused port. Links can then be created from
/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S99cvw and /etc/rc.d/rc0.d/K99cvw to cvw.boot, and
also /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S99cvwds and /etc/rc.d/rc0.d/K99cvwds to
cvwds.boot to allow the startup and shutdown to occur
automatically. To start the processes manually, simply type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S99cvw start
/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S99cvwds start
</pre><p>To test whether the server processes are operational, a
TELNET session can be used. See Listing 1 for information on
running these tests.
</p><p><a href="3465l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>To present your users with a complete CVW experience, you'll
want to build a repository of user images. These images will be
presented on the client software as the users move from room to
room to allow a virtual &ldquo;face-to-face&rdquo; feeling. The user images
should optimally be 50x60 dpi gif images (although other sizes
should scale within the client) that may be stored in one of two
locations. First, if you have a distributed file system (e.g. NFS),
the images may be stored there to allow for global access. The
second option is to make the images available from an HTTP server.
In either case, as long as the image repository is globally
accessible, the client software can be configured to find the
images.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a59580.0x2b52528"></a>Let me In!</h2></div></div><p>Now we need to get a client. Since many computer platforms
normally exist within any given area, we've built client programs
that run under Unix platforms as well as Microsoft Windows. Even
though users may prefer to work on different systems, they can
still collaborate using CVW.</p><p>Two versions currently exist that can run on a Linux system:
the original Tcl/Tk client and a newer Java client. Both are
available in source distributions, but only the Tcl/Tk can be
downloaded as a binary. Additionally, only the Tcl/Tk client can
support administration functions, although we hope someone will
want to fix this soon. For this reason, I'll discuss the
installation of the Tcl/Tk binary distribution. However, I will
touch on the Java source distribution later.</p><p>Download the Linux client distribution and save it into a
temporary directory. For the Tcl/Tk client, retrieve the package
named cvw-tk-client-3.2.0-x86-Linux2-libc6.tar.gz. Move to the
directory where you want the client software installed, then run
<b  >tar&nbsp;xvzf&nbsp;<i><tt>package_name</tt></i></b>.
In addition to the client software available from our web site,
several tools can be obtained from other sites. These include
<span   class="bold"><b>vat</b></span> for multicast
audio-conferencing and <span   class="bold"><b>vic</b></span> for
multicast video-conferencing originally developed by the Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory
(<a href="http://www.lbl.gov" target="_self">www.lbl.gov</a>).
Currently, we don't include these tools because we don't have
permission to redistribute them. Once this hurdle has been cleared,
we hope to include everything within the client package.</p><p>Another important configuration step for the client is to
modify the mime types. CVW uses a simple mime lookup to associate
file types with their parent application. This file can be found in
the installation directory under lib/mime-db. To add new mime
associations, simply provide an application to open a given
document type for both reading and writing.</p><p>The README file fully details the remaining configuration
required to connect to your CVW server. Once completed, executing
bin/xcvw from your installation directory will start the
application.</p><p>A default login of &ldquo;User: admin, Password: admin&rdquo; will
allow you to log into your CVW server and CVW. After snooping
around for a minute, you need to accomplish a couple more
configuration steps.</p><p>The &ldquo;Admin&rdquo; menu on the main menu bar provides access to
the system administrator functions. Open the &ldquo;System Settings&rdquo;
menu selection and provide the requested information. Note you
should provide a multicast prefix that will not interfere with
other multicast users on the network. Multicast prefixes can range
from 224.0 to 239.255.</p><p>Before proceeding with commands you can use in CVW, I'll
describe more about your virtual user. Individuals will usually be
assigned a normal user within CVW. This user has the ability to do
a variety of things: move around the environment, create and read
objects, place objects in a room or carry them along in a carrying
folder, and communicate with others within the MOO. The users may
also modify their description to personalize their appearance to
others. Additionally, a user may be made the owner of a room,
allowing him or her to modify the access list and the description
of the room.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3465f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Carrying Folder
</p></div></div><p>A user can be given additional privileges to become a
programmer within the CVW environment. Although CVW doesn't
recognize a programmer as having additional capabilities, a
programmer can modify code and create objects within the MOO
environment.</p><p>The CVW admin is the analogue of a MOO wizard. In other
words, this user has the most capabilities within CVW. The admin
has the ability to: create rooms and users, modify objects, assign
privileges, and configure the CVW environment. Although admin
capabilities can be assigned to anyone, it's advisable to limit the
number of people having this permission.</p><p>After logging into CVW, you enter a building with several
floors. On each floor, you'll find eight rooms and connecting
hallways. Unless permissions intercede, you may move freely around
the building. You may also pick up and examine objects that exist
within CVW.</p><p>Now let's try it out. For the following examples, enter the
MOO commands in the input window just below the scrolled text area.
To find both extra information and examples, use the
<span   class="bold"><b>help</b></span> command, either alone or in
conjunction with the command you want to use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
help say
</pre><p>First, to speak to everyone currently in the room, use the
<span   class="bold"><b>say</b></span> command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
say Hello, World
</pre>


You may also direct speech to a particular person. Although others
may see this conversation, the receiving party will notice you are
directing the conversation to them.
<pre     class="programlisting">
to admin Hello
</pre>


Finally, to communicate privately so no one else sees the
communication, use the <span   class="bold"><b>whisper</b></span>
command, or if the user is in another room, the
<span   class="bold"><b>page</b></span> command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
whisper Hello to admin
page admin Hello
page admin !Hello
</pre>


The last example displays a pop-up to the admin user. This command
makes your comments more noticeable to the receiving party.
</p><p>As in everyday human communications, actions sometimes speak
louder than words. MOOs by default allow for these kinds of
communications. Called an <span   class="bold"><b>emote</b></span>, a
user may let their actions speak for them:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
emote types furiously at the keyboard
</pre><p>Shortcuts for many of these commands can be found on the user
images. By right-clicking on a user image, you will find a pop-up
menu with several communication methods, along with an information
selection. This menu will generate directed communications with the
selected individual that can be seen by everyone.
</p><p>Two other popular communication methods supported within CVW
are audio and video. CVW implements these capabilities by tying in
two common <span   class="bold"><b>mbone</b></span> tools from the
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory: vic and vat. To launch these
tools, press either the Video or Audio button on the top toolbar.
You will notice no configuration will be needed to initiate
conferences with anyone else in the room. CVW automatically handles
session management tasks. Naturally, your Linux kernel will need to
support the audio and video drivers necessary for your particular
hardware to use this functionality.</p><p>You may not always be able to converse with others over CVW,
either because you're away from your desk or busy on something
else. CVW provides commands that allows you to let other users know
you're unavailable:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
idle gone fishing
busy working on project proposal
</pre><p>CVW provides two methods for moving between rooms. First, you
can use the navigation commands (north, south, east, west, up,
down) to simply direct where you would like to go. The
<span   class="bold"><b>go to</b></span> command can also move you
automatically to your destination:
<pre     class="programlisting">
go to CVW Help Desk
</pre>


However, you may have noticed the CVW map button. Clicking on this
button will open a separate window with a blueprint of your
building. This map will also allow you to navigate around the
building. You can choose the floor you wish to see by using the
slide bar at the bottom of the window, and double-clicking on a
room allows you to move quickly between rooms.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3465f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Building Map
</p></div></div>

</p><p>Once in a room, objects currently residing in the room will
be listed in the Contents window. Some of the objects you'll find
include folders, documents, whiteboards and URL links. Menus for
these objects can once again be found by right-clicking their
icons. Options normally found on these menus will allow the user to
view, copy, make a shortcut (link) or delete a document depending
on the user's privileges for the item. You may also take objects
from the room, which will move them to your carrying folder, and
also drop items from the carrying folder back into the room.</p><p>The CVW client will allow you to perform many more actions
with documents and people. These include importing and exporting
documents, getting a listing of people connected to the server,
finding particular people or items, and even creating groups of
people to make communication easier. Rather than stepping through
the myriad of options available (which can take four hours to
teach), I'll instead point to our user-guide, <span   class="emphasis"><em>CVW 3.0
Unix Client Quick Reference Guide</em></span>, which can be found at
our web site.</p><p>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a59580.0x2f4bb68"></a>The Future of CVW</h2></div></div><p>As I mentioned earlier, a Java source client also exists for
CVW. This client uses the Java 2 port recently released by the
Blackdown organization
(<a href="http://www.blackdown.org" target="_self">http://www.blackdown.org/</a>).
Although this client does provide some newer and more advanced
features and also works on Linux, it can be considered a
beta-release and requires some bug fixes. We do believe, however,
this client will eventually become the standard CVW client. We hope
that many users will find it interesting and build it up to match
the capabilities of the Tcl/Tk client.</p><p>Some investigation into replacing the document server has
begun. Although the current server performs sufficiently, it has
several drawbacks: the interactions between the client and server
can't be made secure, the repository consists of one large
directory, and no real authentication mechanisms exist. We hope to
address these issues with a new document server that provides
greater capabilities and performance.</p><p>Since CVW has been made into an open-source project, MITRE
will be concentrating more on developing a next-generation
collaboration system. We hope many people will find CVW as useful
to them as it has been to us and continue to improve on it. Since
it is a relative newborn as an Internet project, many development
possibilities exist. We hope CVW will continue to expose many
people to the possibilities of computer collaboration.</p></div></div>
