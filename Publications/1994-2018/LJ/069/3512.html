(<a href="http://www.openphone.org" target="_self">http://www.openphone.org/</a>)
has a simple goal&mdash;to phone-enable every computer on the planet. If
a computer can browse the Web and play audio from Internet radio
stations, it should be able to place and receive phone calls, too.
The basic technology is available today. The OpenPhone Project aims
at fostering the development of the software that can make this a
reality.

Book Review</a></p><p>Internet telephony, or voice-over IP (VoIP) technology, has
come a long way in the last few years, and the path is cluttered
with a confusing array of ever-changing standards. I will aim to
provide an introduction to the technology and standards on Internet
telephony with the hope that more people will participate in the
OpenPhone Project. Internet Telephony is one of the most exciting
and fastest-growing areas in today's telecommunications world&mdash;and
it's perfect for Linux!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x183d580.0x19357c0"></a>The OpenPhone Project</h2></div></div><p>Phone-enable every computer&mdash;what does that mean? It means
every computer should to be able to act as a phone&mdash;hopefully, a
very smart and programmable phone. There are several practical ways
to accomplish this feat. The simple way is to mimic some of the
capabilities of a phone with a computer's normal resources. For
example, use the sound card and a microphone/speaker to
communicate, and use either a screen-pop dialog or play a sound
file to indicate <span   class="emphasis"><em>ringing</em></span>. Another much more
sophisticated technique is to use a telephony interface board that
allows you to plug a normal phone into your computer. Given today's
inexpensive and powerful phones (especially cordless phones) and
the availability of low-cost telephony interface cards, this is the
approach favored by the OpenPhone Project.</p><p>Telephony interfaces come in a wide and confusing array of
types and capabilities. They seem to fall into two basic
categories: high-density multiline digital interface cards (T-1 or
better) and low-density analog cards. Since most folks don't have a
T-1 circuit in their home, the OpenPhone Project focuses on the
low-density analog cards. These cards are no more expensive than a
decent video card, and provide a whole host of critical features
that make Internet telephony work. The simplest thing they do is
let you plug a normal, inexpensive analog phone into your computer
and provide full control over the ringing and audio. However, they
also provide the hardware-based audio compression so critical to
voice quality. This hardware technology will be discussed in more
detail below.</p><p>The OpenPhone Project is not Linux-specific, although it
certainly has a strong Linux leaning. Like fax machines, the
usefulness of Internet phones depends upon how many other devices
are out there that they can interoperate with. If a Linux-based
OpenPhone can only call other Linux computers, it's of limited
value. However, if an OpenPhone can call any other computer
regardless of operating system, or any other phone anywhere in the
world&mdash;that's powerful! This is the goal of the OpenPhone
Project.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x183d580.0x19359d0"></a>The Hardware</h2></div></div><p>At the time of this writing, the OpenPhone Project is using
the telephony interface boards made by Quicknet Technologies, Inc.
The Internet PhoneJACK is available in PCI (peripheral connection
interface) and ISA (industry standard architecture) bus versions
and provides an RJ-11 interface into which any normal analog phone
can be plugged. It also has headset/microphone and handset jacks.
The Internet LineJACK has the RJ-11 POTS (plain old telephone
system) port and an additional PSTN (public switch telephone
network) port for use as a gateway to the normal phone system. The
Internet LineJACK is presently available with only an ISA
interface. These low-cost interface boards have Linux and Win32
drivers and provide the ability to use a single standard telephone
with your computer. More information is available at Quicknet's web
site
(<a href="http://www.quicknet.net" target="_self">http://www.quicknet.net/</a>)
or in my article in last September's issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> (&ldquo;Voice-Over IP for Linux&rdquo;).</p><p>Talks are underway with several other hardware vendors to
participate in the OpenPhone project. We encourage such vendors to
make drivers available for as many operating systems as possible,
and join us in making OpenPhone work across all platforms.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x183d580.0x1935be0"></a>Voice-Over IP Technology</h2></div></div><p>Telephony can be thought of as having two major parts: the
audio channel used to communicate and the signaling channel(s) used
to control the audio channel. In the traditional public switched
telephone network (PSTN), the signaling happens on a separate
private network owned and operated by the telephone companies. This
separate signaling network uses a protocol called Signaling System
7 (SS7); it is used to control the setup and ending (teardown) of
calls, using the switched circuits in the system.</p><p>The audio-channel portion of the PSTN is mostly composed of
two parts: the local loop, and the central office (CO) equipment
that links all the local loops together. The local loop is the pair
of copper wires that comes into your house or business&mdash;the analog
line. The CO equipment is made up of high-speed digital links; it
is beyond the scope of this article. The local loop uses analog
signals to carry your voice to the CO, where it is digitized and
sent to the CO on the other end of the call. The other CO takes the
digital signal, converts it back into an analog signal and sends it
down the analog line to the called party.</p><p>Internet telephony works the same way, except that the
digitization process happens at your computer, and the high-speed
digital link between end stations is the Internet. Your telephony
interface (or sound card) converts the analog signal to digital and
sends it in IP packets to the destination. The destination computer
converts it back to analog sound signals and plays it out your
phone. Simple, right? Ah, but like most things that involve
computers, the details are the tricky part.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x183d580.0x1935d98"></a>Internet Telephony Audio</h2></div></div><p>An Internet phone must carry the audio signal between the
parties talking&mdash;this is the fundamental requirement. We all know
that the Internet can carry high-fidelity audio, since many of us
have listened to streaming audio music or radio programs using our
Internet connection and PC. Internet telephony is a bit more
complicated, though, since it has to do full duplex (two-way) audio
in real time, and the human ear is quite sensitive to latency. Too
much delay, and the call sounds like it's traveling across a
satellite instead of across the Internet!</p><p>Bandwidth is also an issue, especially over dial-up lines to
the Internet. In the normal PSTN world, the audio on the local loop
is digitized into a 64Kbps digital data stream and presented to the
phone company CO equipment, which then compresses the data for
transport across the phone system backbone. Simple Internet
telephony packages use a similar digitization, yielding a bandwidth
requirement of 64Kbps in each direction for full-quality voice.
That requires 128Kbps of bandwidth, plus extra for signaling and
overhead, so this does not work well across a normal dial-up
Internet connection that is perhaps 56Kbps.</p><p>Luckily, voice compression technology has come a long way and
works quite well. It is commonplace to obtain 8:1 (or better)
compression ratios using today's voice coders (codecs). Modern
Internet telephony interface boards provide these codecs as
standard features.</p><p>The normal phone system sets up virtual (or sometimes real)
dedicated circuits for the voice packets to flow across. The
Internet is much more chaotic. On the Internet, packets can take
different routes from second to second, and may arrive at their
destination out of order, late, not at all or staggered in time.
Late packets might as well be lost, since if the packet is not
there on time and ready to play, there will be a gap in the audio.
Out-of-order packets are probably not useful, either&mdash;if it's out
of order, it's probably late. Packets that arrive at the
destination are unlikely to do so in a neat and orderly way.
Sometimes they take a bit longer or shorter than average&mdash;the
stream is not uniform. This staggering is called jitter. Several
techniques are used to deal with these problems: the Real Time
Protocol (RTP) and jitter buffers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x183d580.0x1935fa8"></a>The Real Time Protocol</h2></div></div><p>Audio packets need to arrive on time and in the correct
order. RTP is a user-level protocol that provides a way to
encapsulate data into packets time-stamped with enough information
to allow the proper playback of audio. The protocol has a companion
control protocol (RTCP) that provides a means for the end points to
stay informed about the quality of services they are receiving. The
complete protocol is described in RFC1889, which can be found at
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1889.txt" target="_self">www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1889.txt</a>.
Several implementations of RTP are available under various
open-source licenses. See Resources for more information and
pointers to those libraries.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x183d580.0x1936108"></a>Jitter Buffers</h2></div></div><p>The Internet is not predictable, and packets sent at nice
predictable rates do not always arrive at the same rate they were
sent. They can arrive slightly sooner or later than the average
latency. If a packet arrives slightly late, the audio device which
is ready to play the next frame of audio has nothing to play. This
causes a discontinuity that degrades the audio quality. In simple
applications, this is a short silent period that makes the voice
sound choppy. In more advanced applications, comfort noise or some
form of audio blending is used to mask the gap. This can make the
voice sound warbled or as if it's under water. These effects are
observed while using cell phones or Internet phones, by the
way&mdash;packet loss and latency is a general problem of all digital
audio applications. RTP provides a means for the application
software to know if packets are out of order, missing or running
early or late. The application can then make the appropriate
corrections for missing or misordered packets.</p><p>The best solution for dealing with jitter (short of a perfect
transport path, which would eliminate it entirely) is to make sure
the audio device never &ldquo;runs dry&rdquo;. This requires jitter buffers.
These buffers store a small amount of audio at the beginning and
then stay a bit ahead of the flow so that there is always an audio
frame to play. Several one-way real-time audio/video programs will
buffer up many seconds of data before playing any sound, thus
ensuring they will always have plenty of data on hand to play.
However, every frame buffered adds latency, which is especially
relevant to voice calls. If you buffer 90 milliseconds (ms) of
data, you add 90ms to the delay between the time the words are
spoken and when they are heard. When added to the latency of the
Internet itself, this can rapidly become unacceptable. Some people
believe 200ms of latency is a good upper limit for what the human
ear can tolerate. Given that many Internet locations are 100ms or
more (one way) apart, adding 90ms of jitter buffer latency accounts
for a significant fraction of the acceptable delay. A delicate
balance lies between the need to jitter buffer and the need to
reduce latency.</p><p>Jitter buffer techniques are one of the areas where I think
the Open Source community can contribute significantly. There is
much thought and experimentation going on now to find algorithms
and techniques to use adaptive jitter buffers in two-way real-time
audio streams. I suspect the cumulative efforts of the Open Source
community will find some excellent solutions to this in the next
year. I hope the OpenPhone Project can be a catalyst for making it
happen sooner.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x183d580.0x19362c0"></a>Audio Codecs</h2></div></div><p>The standard PSTN digitization technique is described by the
ITU G.711 specification. This document describes an 8KHz sampling
rate using 8 bits per sample, for an effective 64Kbps data rate.
There are two subsets of this technique: A-Law and Mu-Law. These
are scaling factors that take into account the sensitivity of the
human ear and allow for a more efficient utilization of the 8-bit
encoding space for recording the human voice. Both are in wide use
and are considered standard codecs.</p><p>However, 64Kbps is excessive for Internet telephony. Two-way
audio encoded in this manner yields 128Kbps of audio alone (not
counting signaling or overhead), making it impractical for use
across a dial-up link, and wasteful of bandwidth even on a LAN or
WAN link. Voice compression is the answer, and there are several
options from which to choose.</p><p>Audio codecs can either be implemented in software or
provided by the telephony interface card using an on-board DSP. On
a lightly loaded PC, the extra processing load incurred by the
encoding is not particularly burdensome, although it can be on more
heavily utilized machines. Software-only solutions can add some
latency, since the encoding usually happens in a user-space program
and is thus at the whim of system load and the scheduler. Internet
telephony cards use on-board DSPs to perform the encoding,
virtually eliminating the load on the host CPU and the associated
latencies.</p><p>Perhaps the most widely used codec in Internet telephony is
G.723.1. This codec provides either a 6.3 or 5.3Kbps data stream of
packets that hold 30ms of audio each. The encoding requires 7.5
milliseconds of lookahead, which, when combined with the
30-millisecond frame, totals 37.5ms of coding delay. This is the
minimum theoretical latency using this codec. Of course, real-world
latencies will include the time on the Internet and
application-level processing at both ends (and the jitter
buffer&mdash;mustn't forget that).</p><p>G.723.1 is patented technology. The patent holders charge
royalties for its use, making it impossible to use in open-source
software. However, most telephony boards (including the hardware
used by the OpenPhone Project) include this codec as part of the
board price. Aside from other technical advantages of telephony
interface boards over sound cards, the inclusion of licensed
compression codecs on the card is perhaps the single best reason we
need these cards. With the codec in hardware, we can write
open-source software and not violate any licenses. I'd like to
point out that the G.723.1 codec is very different from the G.723
codec (a much higher bandwidth codec in which the source code is
widely available, but not often used due to high bandwidth
requirements).</p><p>Rapidly gaining in popularity are the G.729 and G.729A
codecs. These codecs use an 8KHz sampling rate, a 10ms audio frame
and a 5ms lookahead buffer, for a total of 15ms processing latency.
Because the frames are only 10ms long, this codec suffers less from
packet loss&mdash;the software has less to recover, given the loss of
any one packet. G.729A is a version of the codec that uses fewer
DSP resources, making it easier to implement on lower-performance
(cheaper) DSP chips. The audio quality these codecs can deliver is
astounding. I recently experienced a LAN-based call using the
G.729A codec and stood next to the person calling me. I could
detect no perceptible delay between the direct path (his mouth to
my ear) and the link across the network. If I had not known
otherwise, I would have sworn it was a normal PSTN call. This codec
is the future of Internet Telephony.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x183d580.0x1936580"></a>In-Band Signaling</h2></div></div><p>In-band signaling includes all the tones you normally hear in
the course of a call, including ringing, busy-signal, fast-busy and
the all-important dual-tone modulation frequency digits (DTMF).
These tones are a normal expected part of using a telephone, but
unfortunately, many do not compress well with the algorithms
discussed above. One alternative, the one chosen by the OpenPhone
project, is to pass these signals as a separate data type within
the real-time audio stream. This has the advantage of ensuring that
the signals are reproduced accurately at the other end of the
connection regardless of the audio codec needed, and it reduces the
bandwidth needed to convey the data.</p><p>This technique is described in an Internet Draft (see
Resources). It basically specifies a new RTP data payload type; the
application layer simply sends the data in the stream along with
the normal audio. One very tricky aspect needing more work is the
code required to remove the actual audio signals from the audio
data stream prior to compression. Should these tones and signals
get compressed, the codecs will distort these signals at the far
end, reducing the chances of properly detecting the signal or tone.
It's far better to filter these signals out prior to compression
and to pass the signal across the network directly, allowing the
other end to reproduce the signal with perfect accuracy.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x183d580.0x19366e0"></a>Internet Telephony Signaling</h2></div></div><p>In the traditional PSTN world, the phone companies have a
private dedicated network to do all the signaling. Every phone
system in the world that wants to interoperate with the rest of the
world must use the SS7 network and play by its rules. On the
Internet, though, there is no separate dedicated network&mdash;control
and data signals use the same network. How does signaling work,
then? It's not very simple. There are several different ways to get
the job done, and several different &ldquo;standards&rdquo; in place to
provide guidance. This is a simplification of the issues and
standards. I refer you to the Resources section for places to
obtain more detailed information.</p><p>Several standards for Internet telephony are currently in
use: H.323, SIP and MGCP are the predominant ones in use now. I
cannot hope to provide more than a quick introduction to these
protocols, but can certainly provide an overview and pointers to
where to learn more.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x183d580.0x1936840"></a>H.323</h2></div></div><p>H.323 is a family of protocols established by the
International Telecommunications Union (ITU). It is highly complex,
but covers most of what one would want to do with audio-visual
conferencing or calling over networks. H.323 arose out of the
telecommunications world, not from the Internet world. It is a
binary protocol that uses ASN.1 notation/encoding for message
passing. This protocol is in wide use and presently has the highest
level of use. Many commercial packages use H.323. H.323 is so
widely deployed that many feel new VoIP applications must support
the protocol. However, H.323 is so complicated that
interoperability between different implementations is not good. For
better or worse, Microsoft's NetMeeting product seems to be a
common benchmark for measuring interoperability. Since Microsoft
makes NetMeeting available for free, it's easily available, and if
a product can interoperate with it, you are assured a wide user
base. There are several excellent open-source projects working to
provide this protocol to the community&mdash;most notably the OpenH323
Project. These folks have a working protocol stack now capable of
making a call to a NetMeeting client on a Win32 machine. This is
tremendous success, and I hope to see even more improvements as
this code is used in more and more projects. The OpenPhone Project
will use the OpenH323 libraries and the slimmer &ldquo;Simple Endpoint
Terminal&rdquo; code that Vovida Networks derived from it. See Resources
for more information and places where you can obtain that
code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x183d580.0x1936948"></a>SIP</h2></div></div><p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is described in
RFC-2543. This IETF protocol arose from the Internet community; it
has a feel not too different from HTTP and similar protocols. It is
a text-based protocol that uses fairly simple commands to get the
job done. It is much more oriented towards telephony services,
whereas H.323 provides details on full multimedia audio-visual
services. SIP is growing in popularity because of its relative
simplicity and ease of implementation. A few links to more
information on SIP are in the Resources section. At the time of
this writing, I am unaware of an open-source implementation of SIP,
although there has been much talk about starting such a project.
The OpenPhone Project would very much like to see this project, and
perhaps we can facilitate getting it started. We will certainly
provide a home for it if anyone is interested.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x183d580.0x1936a50"></a>MGCP</h2></div></div><p>The Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) is a protocol and
API for controlling voice gateways from a centralized server or
&ldquo;Call Agent&rdquo;. The protocol is text-based and relatively
straightforward. The complete protocol is described in an IETF
draft (see Resources for link information).</p><p>This protocol is finding wider acceptance and is thought by
many to be superior to H.323. However, it is interoperable with
H.323, since the Call Agent can act as an H.323 Gatekeeper. This is
probably where the future of VoIP call control is going, and the
OpenPhone Project intends to use this protocol as the default
wherever possible. An open-source implementation of MGCP is
available from Vovida Networks (see Resources), and several
commercial versions are available. However, since the specification
is not ratified and is changing slightly (but frequently), there is
no assurance at this time that two different MGCP implementations
will work together. This is an area where open source can make a
huge contribution to Internet telephony. Vovida's MGCP
implementation is released under the LGPL license, which allows for
commercial use without releasing the associated source code for the
non-open portions of the application. With polish, such an
open-source MGCP could be used in a wide variety of applications
and systems, assuring interoperability by virtue of using the same
base code for the protocol. The OpenPhone Project will be using the
Vovida code for its MGCP control with the hope of extending and
enhancing the protocol to stay current with the ratified MGCP
protocol.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x183d580.0x1936bb0"></a>OpenPhone&mdash;A Basic Description</h2></div></div><p>We envision a basic application that provides a framework for
Internet telephony using plug-in modules to accomplish the various
tasks to be performed. For example, one plug-in module would
provide the signaling tasks, and another would provide the audio
tasks (including use of RTP and jitter buffers). We envision an
H.323 module, a SIP module and an MGCP module&mdash;the user could
select which one to use based on the interoperability requirements.
New modules could be plugged in as needed to evaluate different
RTP/jitter buffer techniques. As improvements are made in signaling
or audio-transport modules, all the user has to do is drop in the
new module.</p><p>All that is needed to make this approach viable is a common
API for applications to use to perform basic high-level functions.
The modules would all provide those API functions; the appropriate
module would be used to provide the actual functionality. Since
many people refer to the signaling and audio code as a &ldquo;stack&rdquo;,
we call this the Stack Adaption Layer (SAL). The SAL is a commonly
defined and adopted API that will allow the application developer
to focus on the functionality of the program, and the stack
developers to focus on the detailed lower-level
implementation.</p><p>To extend the concept down a layer and provide platform and
hardware independence, we envision a Hardware Adaption Layer (HAL)
that provides a set of common functions for controlling and using
the hardware. This allows the signaling/audio stacks and the SAL to
work seamlessly on top of the HAL code, regardless of which
Internet telephony card is in use at the hardware level. This
approach will allow us to realize the goal of true cross-platform
multi-vendor interoperability.</p><p>Design specifications for the SAL and HAL layers are in
active development as of this writing, and by the time of
publication there should be several white papers and some reference
code available on our web site. We encourage active participation
and have started a mailing list devoted to the project. You can
join this majordomo-hosted list by sending a &ldquo;subscribe&rdquo; message
to developers@openphone.org.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x183d580.0x192d650"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Internet telephony has many intricate pieces that work
together to make it function well. There are programs available now
that work&mdash;but not at a level that is truly useful. Most of these
implementations fall short because they don't use modern
compressed-codecs, or because they don't use something like RTP and
good jitter-buffer techniques to control the audio stream. Most
also lack a standardized signaling protocol that provides
interoperability with other programs. The OpenPhone Project aims to
provide a new, highly flexible framework that uses plug-in modules
to provide the components discussed above. It will be based on
inexpensive, easily available hardware that can be used in normal,
commonly available computers. OpenPhone will use modern techniques
to provide near-toll-quality calls between any two phone-enabled
computers, and hopefully will foster growth and acceptance of
Internet Telephony to the point that all computers are
phone-capable.</p><p><a href="3512s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
