    Having trouble connecting to the Internet? Weep no more&mdash;the
    answer is here.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12c4580.0x13bc500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Ah! Bonjour! Nice to see your friendly
faces back in my restaurant, &ldquo;Chez Marcel&rdquo;. Please, sit down.
Your table is ready and Fran&ccedil;ois will bring you your wine
imm&eacute;diatement.
</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois! Wine! Vite! Vite!</p><p>As you already know, the topic for this issue is networks and
communications. Take it from Marcel; a little networking can get
you an awful lot of communication. A memo here and a memo there and
all of a sudden you are drowning in e-mail.</p><p>Quoi? No e-mail? You have not yet set up your Internet
connection? But this is terrible. How can you be overwhelmed with
messages promising you easy ways to make money or offering you
questionable services, such as finding love in all the wrong
places, if you are not yet connected to the Internet?</p><p>Let me show you the basics of a PPP connection, and then I
will show you ways to make the whole process even simpler. Sounds
good, non? The very first thing you need to do is make sure you
have PPP installed. PPP stands for Point-to-Point Protocol, and it
is the means by which the vast majority of Internet service
providers (ISPs) make it possible for their clients to
connect.</p><p>PPP can be installed as a package. In Red Hat, Caldera, or
any of the fine Linuxes that use the Red Hat Package Manager (RPM),
you can use this command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -ivh ppp-
</pre><p>If you are running Debian, the command is similar:
<pre     class="programlisting">
dpkg -i ppp-
</pre>


For brevity, I will not try to go into whether your kernel has PPP
support compiled in and what to do if it does not. If you have a
recent Linux distribution, I can guarantee it is there.
</p><p>The next step is to get some information from your ISP. This
is your user name (which will most likely be your e-mail address as
well) and password, along with the DNS (domain name server)
address. You should also have the mail server information for your
e-mail package. The sort of information you need to get are POP
(post-office protocol) and SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol)
server addresses.</p><p>When your ISP gives you the DNS address, edit the file
/etc/resolv.conf with your favorite editor (vi, anyone?) and add
that information as below. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>XXX</em></span>s are, of
course, replaced by the numbers your ISP provides.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
nameserver
</pre><p>A PPP setup in its simplest form involves a chat script and a
properly configured options file. These files are most likely in
the /etc/ppp directory.
</p><p>The first thing to do is edit the options file. Mine looks
like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/modem
     57600
     modem
     crtscts
     lock
     defaultroute
     noipdefault
     connect "/usr/sbin/chat -vf /etc/ppp/chat-script"
</pre><p>My modem lives on /dev/ttyS0, but I also have a symbolic link
to /dev/modem for convenience
(<b  >ln&nbsp;-s&nbsp;/dev/ttyS0&nbsp;/dev/modem</b> is
the command to create that link, if it does not exist). What do the
other items mean? <b  >57600</b> is my baud rate, while
<b  >crtscts</b> means that my modem should use hardware
flow control. The <b  >lock</b> statement means that
<span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> (the PPP daemon) should
create a lock file to ensure that some scoundrel does not try to
use my modem while I am trying to connect to my ISP. The next
parameter, <b  >defaultroute</b>, means that a default
route to my PPP interface should be established after the
connection is up. That means all nonlocal traffic knows to go out
through my point-to-point interface. The last parameter (before
<b  >connect</b>) is <b  >noipdefault</b>,
which means I did not specify a local address for the connection.
The PPP daemon will try to figure this out on its own by getting
the local address from the system.
</p><p>The <b  >connect</b> statement describes how we go
about establishing this PPP connection and is our chat script.
<span   class="bold"><b>chat</b></span> is a command whose purpose in
life is to establish a connection with your ISP. This little
program talks to your modem, watching for things like the
<b  >CONNECT</b> string or a login prompt. A sample chat
script follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ABORT 'NO CARRIER'
     ABORT 'NO DIALTONE'
     ABORT 'ERROR'
     ABORT 'NO ANSWER'
     ABORT 'BUSY'
     "" ATZ
     OK ATDT5550000
     CONNECT ""
     ogin: myISPlogin
     ssword: myISPpassword
</pre><p>This is the classic &ldquo;expect/send&rdquo; script. Expect nothing,
then send <b  >ATZ</b> to reset the modem. When the modem
responds with &ldquo;OK&rdquo; (you expected that, did you not?), send
ATDT<span   class="emphasis"><em>yourISPphonenumber</em></span>, and so on.
</p><p>My example above is frighteningly simple. I kill this
connection by finding pppd's process ID (use
<span   class="bold"><b>ps</b></span>) and terminating it with a
<span   class="bold"><b>kill</b></span> command. For the down and
dirty of PPP, check out the latest PPP HOWTO on the Linux
Documentation Project web site (see Resources).</p><p>Would you like an even <span   class="emphasis"><em>easier</em></span> way to do
this?</p><p>The truth is that PPP setup is fairly simple; however, little
ripples like PAP authentication or CHAP or even the vagueries of
your ISP's setup can make the whole process somewhat less friendly.
Instead, you can try some of these wonderful precooked programs for
easy Internet access. As is the nature of Linux cooks, after
working hard on making things work, they will often create recipes
designed to simplify the process for others. The following PPP
dialer entr&eacute;es should have your mouth watering in no time.
The only catch is that being on-line already makes it easier to get
your hands on these, but if you are still fighting with your
connection to your ISP, ask a friend to get these packages for
you.</p><p>First on the menu is Hwaci's
<span   class="bold"><b>eznet</b></span> software. This great little
piece of software needs only your login name, password, and ISP's
phone number, and you are ready to roll. While you are visiting the
web site (see Resources), pick up Mark Hall's Tk front end to
eznet, <span   class="bold"><b>xeznet</b></span>. This client makes
it almost too friendly. A note of caution: the &ldquo;eznet&rdquo; binary
must live in the /usr/bin directory.</p><p>Starting the xeznet interface is easy&mdash;simply type
<b  >xeznet</b>. For a screenshot of xeznet in action,
have a look at Figure 1.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3713f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. xeznet Screenshot
</p></div></div><p>The next item on tonight's menu comes from Worldvisions
Computer Technology Inc. Like our previous chef, they have created
a wonderfully intelligent tool for connecting to your ISP. In
running <span   class="bold"><b>WvDial</b></span>, I recommend you
also pick up Patrick Patterson's KDE front end, a little something
he calls <span   class="bold"><b>KWvDial</b></span>. After getting
and building the package, I simply clicked on
<b  >Configure</b>. Kwvdial/Wvdial sought out and found
my modem without a problem, setting baud rate on the fly. Armed
with only my login name and password, Wvdial/Kwvdial had me
connected to my ISP in seconds.</p><p>The command to start the interface is simply
<b  >kwvdial</b>.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3713f2.large.jpg"><img src="3713f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. kwvdial Screenshot
</p></div></div><p>Both of these products are available in source distribution
as well as various binary distributions. Check the web sites to
decide what is easiest for you.</p><p>Well, mes amis, it is once again closing time. I do hope
you'll see your way clear to paying us another visit at
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>.</p><p>Bon App&eacute;tit!</p><p><a href="3713s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
