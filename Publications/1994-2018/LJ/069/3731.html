    You voted, we counted&mdash;here are the results.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13d5580.0x14cd298"></a></h2></div></div><p>Welcome to the 1999 <i  >Linux Journal</i> Readers' Choice Awards, brought to you by the
same people who brought you the Editors' Choice Awards last month
(remarkable). The Linux scene has exploded since this time last
year, with more software than we could keep up with. Hence,
omissions were so frequent, the poll was almost a comedy of errors,
but fortunately no spreadsheets showed up listed in the games
section. Over 8,000 people voted, more than twice last year's
turnout. It was fun, and the results were even different from last
year! Worth noting is that Emacs received numerous write-ins in
nearly all of the categories. Apparently, it does more than we
thought. Included are some voter write-ins and comments (in
italics) for your delectation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13d5580.0x14cd3f8"></a>Favorite Distribution: Debian GNU/Linux</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3731f1.jpg"></div>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Better than all the rest.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Debian GNU/Linux with 27.3% scores a 21-vote upset over last
year's winner SuSE which got 27.0%, while Red Hat falls to number
three by about 200 votes, with 23.6%. This victory for Debian
GNU/Linux is sure to warm the hearts of free-source enthusiasts
everywhere. In other news, Slackware is still alive at 5.7%,
Mandrake and Caldera received 7.1% and 6.1% respectively, and the
others have their followers, though not many (no other distribution
scored 1%).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13d5580.0x14cd710"></a>Favorite Window Manager: KDE</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3731f2.jpg"></div>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;I prefer console mode.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;GNOME with Enlightenment in the future, KDE
now.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>The K Desktop Environment (technically speaking, the K Window
Manager) wins again with 36.6% of the vote, far ahead of its
nearest competitors WindowMaker and Enlightenment, which gathered
17.8% and 16.1%, respectively. Other niche managers have devoted
followings, but it appears as if the days of FVWM have wound down
and a new era has begun&mdash;that of the desktop environment. Many
window managers added and improved theme support, making it easier
to change managers and aesthetics. The windowing diversity on Linux
makes it easy to forget that other operating systems don't offer
the freedom to choose in this area.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13d5580.0x14cdad8"></a>Favorite Audio Application: mpg123</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;mpg123 lets me play Pink Floyd; cthugha lets me
see it...&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>mpg123</b></span> garners 35% of the
vote to prove the overwhelming popularity of the mpeg format which
is so efficient, many lobbyists tried to have it outlawed.
Fortunately it's still legal, and we're having a lot of fun with
it. RealAudio is number two with 20%, while paranoia (to rip CDs
into mpegs) with 10% takes third place. XMMS/X11Amp received
several write-in votes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13d5580.0x14cdce8"></a>Favorite Programming Language: C/C++</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Something wants to make me vote for Logo... but
I'll spare you. :)&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>The old UNIX standard&mdash;the closest thing we have to a
cross-platform assembler&mdash;wins nearly half the vote at 49.4%. We'll
have to split C and C++ next year; we received countless &ldquo;I hate
C++&rdquo; comments, a sentiment shared by nearly everyone who voted.
Perl had an excellent showing, with 20.6% of the vote, compared to
the up-and-coming Python which scored 4%. At 9.5%, Java appears to
have become rather popular, and a concerted effort from PHP
enthusiasts managed to score it 4.6%. Emacs (meaning ELisp,
probably) received a large number of write-ins. Doesn't anyone use
assembly code anymore?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13d5580.0x14cdea0"></a>Favorite Text Editor or Word Processor: vi &amp;

vim vim.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Emacs is the true path to Nirvana!&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Yet again, vi scores a large victory with 31.1% of the votes,
over StarOffice and Emacs which had 15.2% and 14.9%. XEmacs, last
year's runner-up, appears to be less popular this year, taking
10.4%. Popular with old UNIX hacks, vi is gaining a large following
in the GNU generation. &ldquo;Ack! Are you still using vi?&rdquo; I once
asked. &ldquo;No, man. I <span   class="emphasis"><em>learned</em></span> vi.&rdquo; Vintage
software&mdash;the next cool thing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13d5580.0x14ce160"></a>Favorite Linux Web Page: Slashdot.org</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3731f3.jpg"></div>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Long live Cmdr Taco!&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>&ldquo;Next to</em></span> <i  >Linux Journal</i><span   class="emphasis"><em>? Slashdot.&rdquo;</em></span></p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Man are the ballots going to be stuffed on this
one :-)&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Was there ever any doubt? It's not an exclusively Linux page,
but Slashdot takes 41.3% of the vote. Freshmeat.net is second with
16.6%, while none of the others did very well at all. Discouraging
news for Linux gamers: Happy Penguin (The Linux Game Tome) made
only 0.8%.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13d5580.0x14ce6e0"></a>Favorite Shell: Bash</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;conch&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;You know, bash could also stand for best of all
shells. :^)&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>The Bourne Again Shell gathered a monstrous 77.8% of the
vote, by far on of the bigger victories in this year's poll. tcsh
managed 10.5%, and ksh got 5.2%. There would probably be a
different distribution between shells one likes to use and shells
one likes to write scripts for, but it's clear that bash is where
it's at. Shells have cool names like ash, bash, zsh (to keep in
mind when naming your children).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13d5580.0x14ce948"></a>Most Indispensable Linux Book: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
in a Nutshell</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3731f4.jpg"></div>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>&ldquo;What a stupid name,</em></span> Linux

available on the Internet have?&rdquo;</em></span></p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;/usr/doc is your friend. ;)&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Scoring a seven-vote victory, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux in a
Nutshell</em></span> by Ellen Siever, et al. won over Matt Welsh's
classic <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span>, 19.0% to 18.8%. Last
year's winner, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Network Administration Guide</em></span>,
was third with 11.8% of the vote. There are many books for
beginners, but these were selected as the best. Truly there is no
shortage of Linux books, though I wonder how the Linux
Documentation Project is coming along. It received many write-ins
but not quite enough to make a showing, and technically speaking
it's not a book. Still, the enthusiastic support for LDP shows
where Linux users' loyalties lie.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13d5580.0x14c57b0"></a>Favorite Web Browser: Netscape/Mozilla</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3731f5.jpg"></div>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>&ldquo;Netscape, but it's a</em></span> cope
<span   class="emphasis"><em>sort of thing.&rdquo;</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>Five people &ldquo;accidentally&rdquo; wrote in Internet Explorer&mdash;they
officially lose. Netscape, deemed the &ldquo;lesser of the evils&rdquo; by
voters, wins with 86.7%. Netscape may sometimes leak memory like an
NT box, but let us never forget what it did for the Open Source
movement (that guy Raymond, Linus Pauling, et al.). Lynx came in
second with 8.3%, and the K File Manager was third with 4.4% (good
job, guys; this one is fast for a graphics browser). Mnemonic
appears to be completely dead, and Arena is not so successful right
now either. Hopefully, Mozilla will stand on its own by next year.
Ah, who uses the Web anyway?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13d5580.0x14c5b78"></a>Favorite <i  >LJ</i> Column: Kernel Korner</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Kernel info is fun for the whole

Slashdot won't tell, I can read from upFRONT. It has things to
check out and news to talk about.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>&ldquo;Kernel Korner&rdquo; is the perennial favorite this year with
26.9% of the vote, followed by &ldquo;Best of Technical Support&rdquo; which
had 21.2%. This probably says something about
<i  >LJ</i> readers. David Bandel's &ldquo;Focus on
Software&rdquo;, each month a wild assortment of rarities from the
software world, scored number three with 16.3%. Reuven Lerner's
consistently popular &ldquo;At the Forge&rdquo; was a close fourth at 13.1%,
and received many glowing comments. &ldquo;Linux Means Business&rdquo; had
11.1%, and the new &ldquo;upFRONT&rdquo; managed 4.1%.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13d5580.0x14c5f40"></a>Favorite Backup Utility: BRU</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3731f6.jpg"></div>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Backup? Who needs backup? Maybe it sounds
crazy, that's okay, it is.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>BRU, with 35.5% of the vote, comes in ahead of its closest
rivals Amanda which had 15.3% and Lonetar which had 10.8%. Worth
noting were the number of write-ins advocating
<span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span>, a simple solution you can
insert easily into <span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span>. While BRU
and Lonetar are proprietary, Amanda is freely available, in case
you actually want to back something up&mdash;but Linux is so stable!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13d5580.0x14c6308"></a>Favorite Communications Board: Cyclades</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3731f7.jpg"></div>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Slashdot!&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Cyclades, with 37.7%, seems to be more popular than its
competitors Digi International with 15.8% and Boca with 10.0%.
Cyclades has a cool name, but do you pronounce it like the island
chain?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13d5580.0x14c6620"></a>Favorite Database: MySQL</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3731f8.jpg"></div>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Who needs databases?&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>MySQL, the free database from Finland and Sweden, scores big
points with 42.4%, compared to PostgreSQL with 19.5% and Oracle
with 15.2%. The Berkeley Database, which is embedded in practically
everything, scored only 1.4%, which is odd. Still, it stands to
reason that MySQL would be a favorite choice of the Linux
community, considering its origins and relatively free license.
Someone wrote in M$ SQL, as a joke... I think.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13d5580.0x14c6938"></a>Favorite Graphics Tool: GIMP</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3731f9.jpg"></div>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;I hope to earn my black-belt in script-fu some
day.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>In an amazing upset victory... oh, wait. The GIMP wins again
this year, with 76.8% of the vote.
<span   class="bold"><b>xv</b></span> and CorelDraw each got 8.1% of
the votes (though xv was ahead by 4 votes). The GIMP blew away
everything years ago; now it is polished and beautiful. You can do
anything with it, even if you're not a graphics expert. Then, you
can use SatanPaint (which scored 0.1%) to convert your drawings
into C include files. It is interesting that Linux has such a
fantastic graphics package, while audio seems to have been largely
neglected. Are Linux types visually inclined? Apparently so, and
projects like the GIMP, GNOME, Enlightenment, KDE and the themes
trend are all evidence, as well as the new wave of screen savers
and demos.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13d5580.0x14c6ca8"></a>Favorite Linux Demo: State of Mind by Skal of
Bomb</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Linux has a demo scene? I have to check this
out!&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Even though we can't take over every processor cycle and sync
our routines to raster positions, Linux finally has demos, lots of
them. It is no surprise that State of Mind would win for this year,
but what <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a surprise is the third-place
finisher, BB by AA (Big Brother, the aalib ASCII demo), which was
not included but had many write-ins. Second place went to XDemo8 by
Lame Over. Technically speaking, most write-in votes went for
&ldquo;What is a demo?&rdquo; or some variant thereof. Someone wrote in
linus.au; hmmm. Truly we have a cool scene, small though it may be.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13d5580.0x14c6eb8"></a>Favorite Mailer: Pine</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Pine is evil.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Pine has displaced last year's winner Elm with a 41.4% vote,
compared to the second-place finisher Netscape Communicator with
32.2% and the up-and-coming Mutt which had 14.7%. What happened to
Elm? It fell to number four, with 6.8% of the vote. Several
variants of Emacs mailers received numerous write-ins. A growing
Pine/Pico recovery and support community will probably lead Mutt to
greater popularity next year; in any event, it has colors and
that's cool.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13d5580.0x14c7070"></a>Favorite Development Tool: gcc</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Emacs+gcc+gdb.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>What would development be without a compiler? The GNU C
Compiler wins with 65.8% of the vote, while the Experimental GNU
Compiler System took 20.9%. Now that the two are reconciled and
together again, that would be an 86.7% collective. The recently
delivered Metrowerks CodeWarrior scored 5.9%, a number which might
be higher if it only ran on more distributions. The free Code
Crusader was fourth with 2.7%, GNUPro Toolkit was fifth with 2.5%.
The Linux standard, Emacs/gcc/make or some variant thereof, was the
most common comment. Where would we be without GNU, or would we be
at all without GNU?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13d5580.0x14c7228"></a>Favorite Linux Game: Quake2</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3731f10.jpg"></div>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Old hackers never die, young ones do.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Quake2, the sequel to Quake (did you know?), is the favorite
Linux game with 23.1% of the vote. Civilization: Call to Power, the
excellent port from Loki (a savior of sorts for Linux gamers) is
second with 13.9%, while XBill is dangerously popular at 8.4%
(beating out the original Quake by 0.1%). Gruesome violence is
inexplicably popular, but in other news, the hacker classic NetHack
managed 5.6%, ahead of FreeCiv which had 4.3%, a good showing for
our free games considering the number of entrants in this category.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13d5580.0x14c7540"></a>Favorite Platform: Intel x86</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>&ldquo;Abaci even have a n33t plural form!
The abacus is the</em></span> only <span   class="emphasis"><em>Y2K compliant computer
known to humanity!&rdquo;</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>Compliant though it may be, the abacus lost to the Intel x86
which scored 82.4%, ahead of Alpha with 6.8% and PPC with 4.8%.
There were hundreds of write-ins for AMD, and almost no one is
under any delusions that Intel makes a better chip. However, the
x86 is, technically speaking, for the most part Intel's fault; AMD
is a clone, better than the original (as so many people wrote) but
still a clone. The new IA-64 looks like it may actually be
<span   class="emphasis"><em>well-designed</em></span>, and who knows what Transmeta
(known more for hiring Linus than anything else) will come up with?
Nowhere is the QWERTY syndrome stronger than in computers, but
maybe we can at least get a better chip set sometime soon;
otherwise, I'll see you at Abacus World Expo.
