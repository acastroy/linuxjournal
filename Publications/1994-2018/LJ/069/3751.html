Bill Gates has played the Goliath role for quite a while, of

David was played by Netscape's Marc Andreessen. Now Linus Torvalds
has been cast in the David role.</p><p>Thus, the headlines read like a play-by-play fight between
Linus and Bill, or Linus and other big/bad tribal chieftains. Here
at <i  >Linux Journal</i>, we found ourselves supplying
material for this sports story when we hosted &ldquo;Linux for Suits:
The Linux and Open Source Executive Forum&rdquo; at Internet World on
October 6 last year.</p><p>Headline:</p><p>Torvalds swings at Linux wannabes: Linux inventor dismisses
moves toward open source by Sun, Microsoft... &mdash;ZD Net story,
October 6, 1999</p><p>Actual Words:</p><p>Question: Microsoft has been talking a lot about opening up
their own code. Whether or not they actually do that is a big
question; but if they should do that, what does it mean for
Linux?</p><p>Linus' Answer: I'd like to start off by saying talk is cheap,
and I think this is a fairly theoretical question. However, as a
theoretical question, I'd be more than happy to see more and more
people open up their source. I'm not convinced, for example, that
the Sun community license is a very good license. But it still
makes me very happy to see that Sun is opening up and making their
knowledge available to others. And if Microsoft were to open up,
I'd be more than thrilled. I don't think it is very likely, or if
it does happen, it will most likely be in niche markets. People
think there is more of a Microsoft bigotry in the Linux community
than there really is. I'm more than happy to use Microsoft
products. It is just that I am selective about the products I want
to use. For example, I've always liked PowerPoint, and I've always
thought that Visual Basic was a good product. It's just been hard
to use them because I've always thought the platforms they run on
aren't good enough. I used to do my slides with PowerPoint for the
longest time with a Windows Installation package. This is true, I
find of all the developers I'm in contact with&mdash;that maybe we take
up Microsoft as a bad example in specific areas, but we're not as
anti-Microsoft as the press makes us seem.</p><p>Find the full transcript <a href="../000/5027.html" target="_self">here</a> &mdash;or

variants. The fact that lex, yacc, vi, troff and other commands ran
uniformly across all of them didn't cut the ice. The plate of
spaghetti here represents most of the variants and the
cross-fertilization. Minix shouldn't be free-standing: it arises
out of V7 from Bell Labs. I miss Dell UNIX, the best n86 version of
SVR4.</p><p>The really important thing is the fact that every one of
these streams is used for web hosting, and that the UNIX+Linux
systems total a remarkable 64% of all sites. In other words, just
about two-thirds of the Web is powered by UNIX or Linux.</p><p>Not bad for an upstart.</p><p>&mdash;Peter Salus</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1755580.0x1b5bf50"></a>WORK STILL CUT OUT</h2></div></div><p>After I took part on a panel at the FreeBSD conference in
October, an attendee invited me to test the honesty of both
<i  >Linux Journal</i> and its community by looking at
exactly which operating systems hosted the most popular Web sites.
So I did. The server and host columns below contain exactly the
data yielded by Netcraft at its &ldquo;What's That Site Running?&rdquo; page
(<a href="http://www.netcraft.com/whats" target="_self">http://www.netcraft.com/whats/</a>)
on October 26, 1999.</p><p>The source list of top 25 sites (in the U.S.) comes from
Media Metrix, which is the primary source of web-site popularity
figures.</p><p>Indeed, the results look good for BSD (5). They look better
for Solaris (10). They perhaps look best for Bill Joy (18), whose
genius is behind the Berkeley, Digital (3) and Sun breeds of UNIX.
Although only Real Networks and Angelfire were found to be running
on Linux (2), Netcraft informs us that other Linux sites include
Deja.com, eToys, Go2Net and The British Royal Family (we knew those
folks had taste).</p><p>Since we're being utterly fair here, Microsoft's NT (5)
doesn't do too badly, either.</p><p>Next, the necessary disclaimer. &ldquo;There's no sure way to tell
what OS a host is running,&rdquo; says our top tech wizard, Dan Wilder.
&ldquo;Indeed, there are lots of ways to fool people about what host is
running. OS names are easily spoofed. We used to spoof them here at
SSC, to foil hackers.&rdquo; To find a fun hack on the supply side of
this information, look at the server finding for Real.com,
below.</p><p>Consolation: as we see elsewhere in this section, Linux is
gaining rapidly overall and now hosts about one-third of all web
domains (according to The Internet Operating System

Orr and I considered founding an organization dedicated to the
proposition that each user should have his or her very own
distribution of Linux. That would make for several million new
versions of Linux, a number we're steadily approaching. Here is one
of the newer, more interesting distributions; quite exciting,
n'est-ce pas?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>kha0S</b></span>&mdash;better living through
extreme paranoia&mdash;aims to be the most secure Linux system ever.
It's so paranoid, in fact, that right now it has stateside
distribution &ldquo;issues&rdquo; on account of cryptography protecting
privacy which is disagreeable to a certain government. kha0S is in
version 0.99 right now, very close to the magical 1.0. Although it
has no pretension of displacing market leaders (kha0S is expressly
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a commercial project), it is vastly more
secure and may raise standards across the board while filling its
particular niche. This is a project not necessarily for people who
need security, but for people who are intellectually fascinated by
it. The kha0S team has surprisingly strong credentials for a fringe
project like this, so they're probably going to turn out something
rather impressive. It's nice to see brain power for Linux existing
in areas which aren't Linux-specific, such as cryptography.</p><p>Kha0S employs a low-level-up approach: each component is
tested to make sure it is completely free of security holes, then
the kernel itself is hardened. Security packages to be integrated
by default include the Cryptographic File System, Kerberos, IPsec,
IPv6, VPN, ssh/lsh and others. The Cryptographic File System is one
of the polishing stones of the kha0S project and should provide
transparent encryption of files on the system (hopefully encrypting
swap as well).</p><p>I suppose there's a limit to how secure a system can be, but
the fun is in the project anyway, isn't it? It's a lot like hacking
in reverse (or cracking in reverse, if you prefer), although I
wonder what these folks were up to in their teenage years while
becoming such security experts.</p><p>For more information on this exceedingly cool distribution,
check out
<a href="http://www.kha0S.org" target="_self">http://www.kha0S.org/</a>,
especially if you're very good at breaking encryption schemes (they
may want you). I wonder how quantum computers will affect the kha0S

PENGUINS!</h2></div></div><p>The first time I saw Windows, I thought it was a joke; I
actually laughed. I didn't look at it again until I bought a PC to
install Linux. That's when I noticed something horrid on my
keyboard: little keys with Windows on them. Well, now Linux has its
own keyboards&mdash;magical custom hardware&mdash;without those Windows
logos.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linux CoolKeyboards</b></span>'
flagship product, featuring the uber-ubiquitous Tux, is a keyboard
appropriate for mainframes. It is serious, heavy, and it clicks, a
genuine &ldquo;Old Skool&rdquo; design from the days when machines were
machines and coders ate pizza (wow, it seems like only yesterday).
It is slightly oatmeal in color, with a 70s brown hard plastic
dustcover (which I recommend removing or decorating) and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>lots</em></span> of keys. The keys are quite perky, among
the least gummy in history. The feel is a question of taste: do you
prefer, for example, Mac keyboards, soft-touch keyboards, laptop
keyboards, etc.? If you believe the only real keyboards are ones
with key-punch, microswitch action, this is just your thing. Ah
yes, the Linux point of this keyboard is the penguins&mdash;two penguins
and a Linux logo&mdash;replacing the Windows keys. As an added bonus,
all twelve function keys are labelled twice (once on the keys and
once on the keyboard, so you can bring it to parties as a
conversation piece) just like in the &ldquo;old days&rdquo;, but then again
there's a Euro mark on the 5, a sign of changing times (along with
our dear penguins). I'd like to see non-oatmeal colors and a more
specialized Linux setup (change caps-lock to control, etc.), as
well as rubber on the feet which are lethally sharp.</p><p>Consideration for the DVORAK layout would also be nice. All
in all, though, CoolKeyboards is on to a good thing (and trying to
patent it for whatever reason). Now, on to smaller things.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Happy Hacking Keyboard
Lite</b></span>&mdash;you've seen those very happy people; this is why
they're so happy&mdash;it's a <span   class="emphasis"><em>tiny</em></span> keyboard, with
only 60 keys, optimized for Linux users. This means that control
replaces caps-lock, escape is next to 1 where ~ usually is,
delete/backspace is large, the number pad has been removed, and the
weird keys (function, cursor, page keys, etc) are accessed with a
special Fn key (as found on laptops). Specialized configuration of
keys can be achieved by way of dip switches and a paper clip. Few
people will realize how tiny this keyboard is until they see it;
the keys are full size, but the board itself is even smaller than
those found on laptops. Strangely, everything fits! This has got to
be the cleverest keyboard design going, especially for vi and Emacs
users. It's much more elegant than a traditional keyboard, but it
also relies heavily on the right hand. The key action has been
described as &ldquo;silky&rdquo;, and is actually very soft, and again not
gummy. The keys are quiet enough, though not quite as perky as on a
laptop or the aforementioned board. As for layout, PFUCA says
DVORAK will be a critical issue for the power user, but there are
no plans for one as yet. PFUCA is delivering a black HHKL soon
(what about translucent purple?), which would be nice paired with a
flat-screen monitor and a tiny computer like a Netwinder (ah,
StrongARM). Good for apartments where space is at a premium and for
people who like small things. No Windows keys, and no penguins.
(Try your local aquarium or zoo for penguin stickers, and go on a
rainy day so there aren't so many people scaring the
animals.)</p><p>If you've worn out your space bar from too much ZBlast, not
to mention what you've done to your cursor,
(<b  >ALT</b>), and <b  >CTRL</b> keys on
account of Quake, maybe it's time for a new keyboard (and/or a
joystick).</p><p>&mdash;Jason Kroll</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1755580.0x1b5d4f8"></a>GAMES FOCUS</h2></div></div><p>In keeping with the theme of world domination, it's time to

begins with three drunken Vikings. Craft features up to four
players, human (with network support) or computer, wandering about
in a world which is a bit Warcraft, a bit Civilization, but rather
less cluttered and faster-paced, with a minimal learning curve.
You've got access to knights, archers, scouts, workers, merchants,
scientists and pawns, as well as town halls, farms, camps, mills,
smiths, universities, forts, markets, docks, ships and catapults.
All in all, you can really go nuts killing things if you like (and
if you want to win). This game is a Linux gem, fast-paced
(real-time as opposed to turn-based) and it doesn't degenerate as
quickly as so many strategic conquest games. Look for it at

This time, they've
managed to create a free and improved Civilization I/II for Linux
that's more fun than the originals. The graphics are really nice, a
bit on the dark side, and the game feels more serious. FreeCiv
supports AI and network play with 32 nations; the newest release
should support an infinite number. Maps can range in size from very
small to very large, and one could, if so inclined, devote a
weekend or longer to a massive clash of civilizations over the Net.
There are 47 different units available, as well as several
different tile sets, so that you can choose your graphics (even in
different sizes). It's a typical client-server model, easy to set
up and play. Here it is, only one download away&mdash;you don't even
have to buy it:

made when he felt Linux didn't have enough games. If steep learning
curves are discouraging, check out this one. There's very little to
worry about except for troops and killing, so you can concentrate
on war. It has rendered graphics (characters and terrain), two
civilizations with ten armies, multiple scenarios (and a map
editor), multiple player support, sound effects and music. The
happypenguin.org site says, &ldquo;just take your troops and
slaughter.&rdquo; Quite right. Find it at

want to get in contact with the Boson development team. Released
under the GPL, Boson is a real-time strategic war game with
absolutely fantastic graphics, only it's not quite playable yet.
Right now the developers are looking for more people to help with
graphics, documentation and the like. It looks really neat,
especially the machinery:
<a href="http://aquila.rezel.enst.fr/boson" target="_self">http://aquila.rezel.enst.fr/boson/</a>.</p><p>TUD (The Urgent Decision) is another very promising game
which may need some developers. It's another take-over-the world
game, but it's network-playable and has a very military approach.
For example, if you want to lead Viking settlements or win a
victory of civilization by controlling all elements of society,
Craft and FreeCiv are for you, but if your brilliance is limited to
the military sphere (or you just like it better&mdash;fast planes, heavy
machinery), TUD might excite, as it's quite mechanical and very
close to that magical 1.0 version. Check out the web page, maybe
it's just the project you're looking for:

use&mdash;our IQs must be over 2000), so now we're ready to go out and
conquer the world (a tad gruesomely at that). There are dozens of
strategy games for Linux; these are only a few highlights. All
these games and more can be found, as usual, on

Solutions for a reported $674 million (US) in a stock-for-stock
merger. I don't think anyone was surprised to hear that Red Hat was
acquiring a company. Ever since the IPO, people have wondered who
it would be and when it would happen. After all, what else were
they going to do with all that money? Plans consisting of building
a bigger and better portal and nothing else is certainly not the
way to inspire confidence in your investors. However, I for one was
certainly surprised that Cygnus turned out to be the company Red
Hat bought. Of course, I had recently heard the rumor and hoped it
would prove to be false.</p><p>Cygnus Solutions has been in business for ten years now. They
are successful. They market good products based on open-source
software, mainly the GNU tools such as gcc and gdb. Recently, they
have marketed an integrated developer tool, called Code Fusion,
which won our Editors' Choice Award for Best New Application for
the Developer. They have always been vendor independent, ensured
all their products ran on all Linux distributions and given back to
the community. Their improvements to GNU tools have always been
open source, giving everyone the chance to benefit from the
advances rather than just those who could afford to pay for them.
For these reasons, they have held a high standing in the regard of
all those in the Open Source community. They have held this same
high regard in the business community, because they have shown that
you can indeed make money from open-source software.</p><p>Now that Cygnus is owned by Red Hat, what will happen? Will
Cygnus products become vendor specific? Will upgrades always be
available to Red Hat first? Will they continue to give back to the
community? At least for this last question, I don't think we have
cause to worry. Red Hat has been good about giving to the community
too&mdash;I don't think that is going to change. But I do worry about
the first two. Now that Red Hat has stockholders to report to,
changes are inevitable&mdash;a definite market edge must be demonstrated
and profits must be made. Red Hat's commitment to the Open Source
movement is going to be put to the test.</p><p>They have bought a good, strong company, one that will help
them show profits and continue to grow. It was a good business
decision on their part. Still, I wish they hadn't made it so soon.
I have no doubt that Cygnus is only the first company to be bought
by Red Hat&mdash;there will be others. I feel it would have been best if
they had first acquired a company that was not as strong; that is,
one that would have benefited more from the merger. Let's not kid
ourselves; Cygnus doesn't need Red Hat to be successful.</p><p>This merger looks like a bid for money and market domination,
not a step taken to further the future of free software. Still,
only time will tell if the Linux community has actually been slimed
or if it just feels that way.</p><p>&mdash;Marjorie Richardson</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1755580.0x1dd8fa0"></a>VENDOR NEWS</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Corel</b></span> announced an alliance
