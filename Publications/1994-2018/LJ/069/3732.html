    And the winners are....
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1de6580.0x1ede558"></a></h2></div></div><p>This fall, <i  >Linux Journal</i> and the Linux Business Expo teamed up to present
the first annual &ldquo;Penguin Playoffs&rdquo;. These awards are designed to
showcase outstanding enterprise products from those exhibited at
the Linux Business Expo. The Expo was held in Las Vegas as part of
COMDEX/Fall 1999 by ZD Events. The awards were given out at a
ceremony on November 16, 1999, in conjunction with the presentation
of <i  >LJ</i>'s Editors' Choice awards announced in
last month's issue. Linus Torvalds was there personally to hand out
the awards to the winners.
</p><p>This year's judges were Jason Kroll, <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s Technical Editor; Marjorie Richardson, Editor
in Chief of <i  >LJ</i>; and Peter Salus, Editorial
Director of SSC. There was a large number of submissions in the
overall, office and web categories, but none in manufacturing. We
agreed to change this category to &ldquo;hardware&rdquo;, so that we could
reward a truly outstanding product.</p><p>Linux has been loved from the beginning by the hacker
community, and for the last year has been making steady inroads
into the business community. One reason for this is more companies
have come up with software applications designed to solve the
problems of the enterprise. To reach Linus' goal of &ldquo;world
domination&rdquo;, Linux must be accepted in the corporate world, and
our winners are helping to make that happen.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1de6580.0x1ede870"></a>Best Web Solution: TurboCluster Server from
TurboLinux</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3732f1.jpg"></div>
</p><p>The TurboCluster Server
(<a href="http://www.turbolinux.com" target="_self">http://www.turbolinux.com/</a>)
aims at providing a low-cost, high-availability server for
electronic business. It possesses automatic &ldquo;failover&rdquo;--should a
machine in the cluster fail, the others pick up that load&mdash;dynamic
load-balancing and redirection, support for Linux, Solaris and NT,
notification support and recovery and maintenance support. In fact,
if an application were to fail on a single machine, TurboCluster
cleverly routes around it. Clusters of Linux machines provide a lot
of power to the business community, and this excellent software is
designed to support the company that chooses to exploit that
power.</p><p>Targeted at corporate web administrators and ISPs, the
TurboCluster Server was clearly this year's Best Web Application
solution.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1de6580.0x1edeb88"></a>Best Hardware Solution: The Happy Hacking
Keyboard</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3732f2.jpg"></div>
</p><p>The Happy Hacking Keyboard from PFU America
(<a href="http://www.pfuca.com" target="_self">http://www.pfuca.com/</a>)
was the clear winner in this category. Based on the Sun Type-3
keyboard with only 60 keys, it is smaller than a laptop keyboard.
The <b  >ESC</b> key is positioned next to
<b  >1</b> for devout vi users, and the
<b  >CTRL</b> key is next to the <b  >A</b>,
perfect for Emacs enthusiasts. The keys are full size, but function
keys and the number pad of extended keyboards have been eliminated
in order to maintain the small size. You never have to move your
hands from the keys or stretch your fingers into uncomfortable
positions; this means faster typing and no muscle strain. This is
an ideal keyboard for UNIX and Linux users in the office. And it
lists for only $69 US&mdash;a useful, pleasant bargain!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1de6580.0x1edefa8"></a>Best Office Solution: Appgen Business and
Accounting Applications</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3732f3.jpg"></div>
</p><p>We like Appgen's PowerWindows Business and Accounting
Applications
(<a href="http://www.appgen.com" target="_self">http://www.appgen.com/</a>)
very much.</p><p>All businesses need accounting software&mdash;it's one of those
facts of life. Appgen includes all the necessary modules to keep
the books balanced and the office records in tip-top shape. This
package ships with eleven applications, all with source
code:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>accounts receivable</p></li><li><p>accounts payable</p></li><li><p>general ledger</p></li><li><p>inventory control</p></li><li><p>sales order processing</p></li><li><p>purchase order processing</p></li><li><p>payroll processing</p></li><li><p>job cost tracking</p></li><li><p>bill of materials</p></li><li><p>billing</p></li><li><p>bank reconciliation</p></li></ul></div><p>Appgen provides a user-friendly system which features
customization of all financial statements, the general ledger,
inventory accounts and more. Customization features make this
product work well for any size business, from small to large.
Information from each module flows to the others effortlessly. A
reminder system and security features are included.
</p><p>This product is on the same level as accounting packages such
as Platinum, Lawson and Eagle Systems. Don't let anyone tell you
there aren't solid business software packages running natively on
Linux. Appgen's solution is first-rate&mdash;one that will be welcome in
any office.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1de6580.0x1edfb58"></a>Best Overall Solution: Global Media
Corporation</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3732f4.jpg"></div>
</p><p>We think that as time goes on, more and more transactions
will be conducted electronically. For this basic reason, we have
awarded Global Media Corp.
(<a href="http://www.globalmediacorp.com" target="_self">http://www.globalmediacorp.com/</a>)
our award for Best Overall Solution.</p><p>Global Media focuses on e-commerce tools for entertainment
companies. They have built a network for the transmission of live
audio and video over the Internet; their ready-made infrastructure
is based on Linux.</p><p>The quality of Web content depends upon the quality of the
stream for both audio and video, and we feel Global Media's private
frame-relay network will result in a far better experience than
what we have received in the past. The broadcast-encoding boxes all
run a customized distribution of Linux. Global Media has teamed
with RealNetworks where content is concerned.</p><p>As the producers of a product with the potential of impinging
on all our lives, Global Media has earned the Best Overall
award.</p></div></div>
