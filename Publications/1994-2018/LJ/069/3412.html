    For those thinking of setting up an alphanumeric paging
    service or gateway, this article explains the protocols and
    methods involved.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c02580.0x1cfa348"></a></h2></div></div><p>Alphanumeric pages&mdash;at least the type we
will consider here&mdash;are delivered via modem. To deliver a page, we
connect to our service provider, communicate with it through its
specified protocol, receive a confirmation that the page has been
delivered, then disconnect.
</p><p>To send a message to someone, we need to know two things
about them: their pager service dial-up number and their PIN
(personal identification number). Alphanumeric pager owners should
be able to contact their pager service provider and get this
information with little trouble.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c02580.0x1cfa4a8"></a>Protocol</h2></div></div><p>Several protocols are used for delivering pages. The most
popular (and among the simplest) is IXO, named after the company
which invented it. It's also been called TAP (Telocator Alpha-entry
Protocol) and PET (Personal Entry Terminal); these names were
assigned to it by other companies over its history.</p><p>In this article, I will talk solely about the IXO protocol.
It is a bit involved so I won't go into great detail, but it is
relatively straightforward. In brief summary, here is a description
of the overall transaction between the remote dial-up site (us,
when delivering a page) and the pager service provider.</p><p>First, we establish a connection and get the service's
attention. After the service acknowledges our intent to transmit a
message, we declare our wish to enter automatic mode&mdash;this is the
simplest method through which to transmit a message, although in
rare cases we may want to use manual mode.</p><p>We wait for the service to acknowledge our request. When we
get the go-ahead signal to send the content of our message, we send
a series of fields. Usually we would send two fields, consisting of
the PIN of the pager to which we wish to send a message, and the
message. We follow the message with a checksum, so the provider can
verify (to some degree) that our message has been faithfully
received. Finally, once we receive an acknowledgement that our
message has been received, we politely request to be disconnected
and drop carrier.</p><p>The IXO protocol (see Resources) supports sending multiple
pages to the same service, but not necessarily the same pager,
during a single transaction. Thus, this method provides the
possibility for optimization in a large-scale service, if we find
many pages are being sent concurrently to people using the same
service, i.e., the same dial-up number.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c02580.0x1cfa710"></a>Profiles and Devices</h2></div></div><p>To start with, we'll need a mechanism for identifying each
pager to which we want to send messages; we'll call them
<span   class="emphasis"><em>profiles</em></span>. As mentioned earlier, there are two
things we need in order to be able to send messages to a particular
pager: the phone number of its pager service and the PIN of that
particular pager. These may be kept in configuration files, which
an administration program can edit and delete.</p><p>If we want to support multiple modems&mdash;that is, the ability
to deliver multiple pages simultaneously&mdash;we also need to know
about and keep track of the physical modems. We'll call them
<span   class="emphasis"><em>devices</em></span>. As with profiles, we'll keep a list
of the devices allocated to our server in a configuration
file.</p><p>Concurrent page delivery should take advantage of
multiprocessing; use <span   class="bold"><b>fork</b></span> to send
multiple pages simultaneously with different devices. This makes
things much simpler in terms of the overall flow control and
doesn't pose any significant problems, since we can simply check
the exit status (succeed or fail) of the subprocess through
<span   class="bold"><b>waitpid</b></span> and take action
accordingly.</p><p>We'll keep the list of devices handy, and when we are
delivering a page using one, flag it as busy. Unless we're going to
be running on a system where the modems are dedicated solely to our
server, we will almost certainly want to use standard lockfiles, in
addition to flagging the devices as used. (Even if the modems truly
are dedicated, it can't hurt to be extra careful.) This will
prevent other processes from interfering with our server while it
is actually in the process of delivering a page.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c02580.0x1cfaa80"></a>Filters</h2></div></div><p>Alphanumeric pagers tend to be limited in terms of how many
characters a message can display; the typical maximum-length
support with the IXO protocol is 256 characters, including the PIN
expressed as a string, so in practice it's usually closer to
250.</p><p>People who get a lot of pages frequently run into this limit,
particularly when longer messages (such as e-mail or notes) are
being sent. A useful solution is to implement a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>filter</em></span>, which processes messages to be sent
and does simple searches and replaces in order to substitute
shorter equivalents for commonly appearing words and phrases. For
instance, the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; might be represented with an ampersand
(&amp;), &ldquo;talk to you later&rdquo; might be abbreviated TTYL, and so
on.</p><p>Filters could also be used to provide a form of security
through obscurity. With most pagers, messages delivered over the
airwaves are not secure; anyone with the right equipment can
intercept them. This means, obviously, that the average person
would probably not want their name, address and other private
information being transmitted over the air. A simple choice of
filters could replace this sensitive information with abbreviations
recognizable to the party receiving the page, but meaningless to
anyone else.</p><p>It would also be straightforward to implement a filter based
on regular expressions, using the POSIX regex library. Since both
the simple and regular expression searches are relatively
straightforward, I will leave them as an exercise to the
reader.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c02580.0x1cface8"></a>Server</h2></div></div><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>server</em></span> is the workhorse of our
operation. Servers process pager delivery requests (we'll call them
<span   class="emphasis"><em>jobs</em></span>) and then deliver them via the IXO
protocol over an available device.</p><p>Jobs consist of two very simple things: the profile to use
and the message to send. How the server receives each job depends
on how we want to structure it. I'll discuss two basic approaches
here: TELNET-based and file-based servers. Each has advantages and
disadvantages, and your choice of which to implement will depend
largely on what sort of clients you want to support.</p><p>TELNET-based servers listen to a specific port on the host
machine and use a simple protocol to send the profile and the
message. A protocol such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
profile
</pre><p>should suffice (provided, of course, that the strings
identifying protocols don't contain newlines).
</p><p>For security reasons, such servers should require some sort
of authentication before accepting a job for delivery. The type of
authentication we should use will depend strongly on our particular
security needs, and is beyond the scope of this article.</p><p>A file-based server, on the other hand, watches a specific
directory on the host machine (pausing for a brief length of time,
then scanning its contents) and reads each new file, creates a job
for it, then processes it; the file can be deleted when the server
no longer needs it. The format of this file need be no different
from the protocol of the TELNET-based server:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
profile
</pre><p>As with TELNET-based servers, file-based servers need to
consider security issues. The server would run as a specific group,
and only programs which are part of that group may submit a job.
When job files are created, they must be owned by the group and
given group-writeable permissions (in a group-writeable directory),
so that the server may delete files when it is done with them. An
authentication scheme would also probably be useful here; at the
very least, some simple encryption may well be in order.
</p><p>Both TELNET- and file-based servers have their respective
strengths. The most obvious for a TELNET-based server is it is
quick and simple, and a client can be run on any machine that can
be reached by the server using the
<span   class="bold"><b>telnet</b></span> command. (Without adequate
security considerations, this can also be a liability.)</p><p>The clients to file-based servers must run on the same
machine (disregarding NFS-mounted directories for the sake of
simplicity) and must be run by a user who is a member of the
appropriate group. The most obvious advantage to a file-based
server is that in the case of a server shutdown or a machine
reboot, the pending jobs will still be waiting, whereas
TELNET-based jobs must offload their pending jobs to disk (or to
another server) if they are shut down.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c02580.0x1cfb268"></a>Clients</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Clients</em></span> are the programs we use to send
jobs to the server. At this point, writing the clients should be
easy, since by choosing the type of server we are going to
implement, we have implicitly chosen the type of client we must use
to communicate with it.</p><p>Clients need to know how to contact the server, as well as
verify that a profile is valid (the client should know when it has
been asked to send a message to a nonexistent pager). To start
with, we need a basic client, one we can run using the command line
(or perhaps STDIN) to specify the profile and message and deliver a
job&mdash;no frills, no fancy interfaces.</p><p>For file-based servers, this is a program (executable only by
members of the appropriate group) which creates a job file in the
appropriate directory with the appropriate permissions. With
TELNET-based servers, the program can be run on any machine which
has TELNET access to the machine on which the server runs and
delivers the message via TELNET.</p><p>Once we have the basic client, we can move on to other types
of clients. Here are two we might want to support:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>An e-mail-based client: something like procmail
could help us do the difficult work here&mdash;procmail can selectively
process incoming e-mail and route it to a program of our choice.
That program could then pick out the relevant headers we want
transmitted (e.g., From, To and Subject) and the body of the
e-mail, then pass it on to the basic client.</p></li><li><p>A web-based client: a CGI script can do the job
here, picking out appropriate form entities and passing them on to
the client. In the file-based server, we must make sure that the
user the web server runs as, often &ldquo;nobody&rdquo;, is also a member of
the pager group. (Be sure to send an HUP signal to the server after
adding it.)</p></li></ul></div><p>In both cases, there are security issues to contend with. We
certainly wouldn't want just anyone who has discovered the e-mail
or web gateway to be able to send any page they wanted to anyone.
The specifics regarding what sort of security precautions are
advisable will depend strongly on the type of service we are
running, so I will not go into detail about them here.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c02580.0x1cfb6e0"></a>Putting it All Together</h2></div></div><p>Now we can fit the pieces of the puzzle together to come up
with our server.</p><p>The main server will read in configuration and data files
(where to find things, the list of protocols it knows about, the
available devices, etc.). It then goes into its main loop.</p><p>If we support multiple devices, use waitpid and its
<b  >WNOHANG</b> option (so that the server will merely
see if any subprocesses have finished, as opposed to waiting
indefinitely&mdash;and blocking all other server activities until a
subprocess <span   class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> finish) to determine whether
any jobs have finished being delivered; remove them from the queue
if they have.</p><p>Then, check to see whether a device is available and a new
job is ready to be delivered; if both are true, then take the
following steps. First, determine the profile and the message from
the job. Then, get the next available device and lock it, so our
delivery will not receive any interference. After that, filter the
message (if appropriate), and finally, start up a subprocess to
deliver it.</p><p><a href="3412s1.html" target="_self">Summary</a></p><p><a href="3412s2.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
