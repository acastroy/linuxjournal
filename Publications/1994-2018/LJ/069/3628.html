things but not great at anything, I often take a somewhat timid
approach to anything calling itself &ldquo;definitive&rdquo;. What nerve it
must take to think of yourself as such an expert! Yet there are
times when the right person, at the right time, with the right
talent, produces a work which rightfully deserves the title of
&ldquo;definitive guide&rdquo;. This is one of those times.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>PNG&mdash;The Definitive Guide</em></span> is Greg
Roelofs' description of the design and use of PNG. PNG is a
specification for a raster image file format. Greg's text,
published by O'Reilly, is a clear and thorough exploration of the
topic. Ranging from the early history of the design to detailed
programming information on chunks and gamma correction to
application support for this new format, the text is a complete
descriptive volume on the subject.</p><p>Pronounced &ldquo;ping&rdquo; according to Greg (although I have a hard
time not vocalizing the three letters separately), PNG has evolved
over the past four years in response to limitations in design and
licensing of the older GIF format. Greg is uniquely qualified to
describe the format and tell its tale of evolution. He was there
when Thomas Boutell first announced the project, and has written
numerous articles on the subject&mdash;including being one of the few
contributing authors I've ever had to my &ldquo;Graphics Muse&rdquo; column
in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span>
(<a href="http://www.linuxgazette.com" target="_self">http://www.linuxgazette.com/</a>).</p><p>The text is divided into three parts: Using PNG, The Design
of PNG and Programming with PNG. The specification for PNG is
platform-independent, and Greg keeps true to this philosophy with
this text. It covers everything from Linux to Windows to BeOS to
OS/2; however, the first section does finish with a focus on
Macromedia's Fireworks 1.0, a decidedly non-Linux
application.</p><p>Greg starts with a decent introduction to raster graphics in
the first chapter. This leads into a long description of the things
for which PNG is most useful. I found this section quite good.
Although I knew there were advantages to using PNG, I never knew
what the specific reasons were. One of the most important, in the
near term if not immediately, will be its support of standardized
color management.</p><p>Greg points out in part one that PNG does not compress as
well as JPEG does, but that JPEG's compression algorithm can lead
to some blockiness around sharp edges in an image. He explains that
PNG perhaps makes a better format for intermediate editing than for
web browsing. This makes sense. PNG has lossless compression, so
repeated saves and reloads in your editing package will produce the
same image each time. TIFF is an alternative, but TIFF's
compression scheme doesn't offer the same speed vs. quality options
that PNG does. PNG can also achieve extremely high levels of
compression without data loss. Conversion to JPEG might be
preferred when the image is prepared for the Web, but that could be
done as a last step before publication. As Chapter 2 mentions, both
MSIE and Netscape support PNG in their latest browsers, although to
different levels, and neither fully supports transparency in their
released versions.</p><p>Chapter 2 also has an interesting discussion on using content
negotiation. This is where you specify a text file with a .var
suffix containing text describing one of multiple choices for the
image to be displayed. Apache supports this with the
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_negotiation</b></span> module and
determines which of the image files specified in the .var file to
send to the browser. A fairly interesting topic if you are into
supporting any browser on the planet.</p><p>Chapter 3 is a simple application reference guide for image
viewers on multiple platforms which support the PNG format. Greg
does a good job of researching many different platforms
here.</p><p>Chapter 4 goes into several image-editing applications with
support for PNG. Greg shows how an image can be created in each of
four major applications&mdash;Photoshop 4 and 5, Paint Shop Pro and the
GIMP&mdash;and then how that image can be saved with PNG.</p><p>Chapter 5 describes a number of command-line image processing
tools that support conversion to or from the PNG format or provide
information on PNG files. All of these tools run on Linux, and Greg
provides download information at the end of each
application-specific section of this chapter, as he does for every
other application he discusses in the text. The chapter ends with a
reference-style list of other conversion tools. Each entry includes
OS and download information.</p><p>The first section of the book closes with a chapter on 3-D
applications with support for PNG. Greg covers VRML browsers in the
first part of this chapter and has short discussions on 3-D
modelers and other 3-D applications in the latter half.
Unfortunately, there isn't much support for VRML under Linux, and
out of the few browsers and VRML applications available for Linux,
even fewer still apparently support PNG. This seems strange,
considering PNG has been adopted as one of two formats for VRML
certification.</p><p>In producing this book, O'Reilly followed the same basic
industry practice of stuffing a couple of color plates in the
middle of the book. In this case, with only two pages of plates,
they might as well have left them out. As with most graphics texts,
the comparative images printed in black-and-white outside the color
plates aren't very useful. The first one is a set of three images
showing a child standing in what looks like one of those boxes your
luggage must fit in to carry it onto an airplane. The three images
are supposed to show the effects of quantization and dithering, but
that's nearly impossible to see in this black-and-white image.
There are full-color versions of these same images, which are also
enlarged, in the two-page color plates in the middle of the book.
These color images do show the differences in the images quite
well. When will publishers realize that texts about graphics need
to be in color? Yes, it increases the cost, but it also increases
the informational value. I'm thankful SSC used four-color printing
throughout when publishing my GIMP book.</p><p>One minor side note: O'Reilly placed one of those generally
annoying advertisement cards at page 188. The card was physically
connected to the binding. I tried to pull it out, and ripped the
page. Fortunately, I didn't rip through any of the text on that
page. They might want to think about adding perforations at the
connecting point for the card.</p><p>Chapter 7 starts the second part of the book, covering the
design of PNG. This chapter is an interesting history into the
evolution of an Internet-supported standard like PNG. An
interesting bit of trivia which I was not aware of comes at the end
of the chapter, where Greg tells us that PNG has been adopted in
response to the MHEG-5 UK Profile, by digital television makers
like Sony, Phillips and Nokia for both televisions and set-top
boxes. I hadn't thought much about bitmap formats for television&mdash;I
guess there's a whole new area of graphics for me to
explore.</p><p>Chapter 8 introduces the basic PNG specifications. Here
you'll find a description of the chunk, the main building block of
the PNG format. Chapter 9 moves into compression information.
Although the second part of the book is technical in nature, end
users will find useful hints sprinkled throughout. In Chapter 9,
for example, there are tips that cover which image types to use
(PNG vs. JPEG, for example) and what settings to look for, given
the format chosen. Greg follows up with tips for programmers on
using compression and filtering.</p><p>One of the reasons I jumped ship from programmer to writer
was that I saw the world was full of people who could write code,
but short on those who could explain that code. I still see many
technical folks taking a shot at writing for the masses and falling
short, often slipping back into the acronymal world of the
techno-geek. Greg is one of a rare breed. His writing style is both
clear and complete, detailed and comprehensible. They should give
medals for this sort of writing or at least little gold sticky
stars.</p><p>Chapter 10 moves into one of the more complex issues in
computer graphics: gamma correction and precision color. Display
devices differ from their hard copy brethren in many ways, and even
in subtle ways from each other. Gamma correction helps to ensure an
image displayed on one device looks the same on another. Some of
the gamma-related features of PNG and how to use them are discussed
here.</p><p>PNG is an extensible format, providing both a defined set of
public chunks and a method for implementors to add their own
private chunks. In Chapter 11, Greg covers many of the extensions
described in the original specification or that have been
officially registered. These include such topics as histogram
information, suggested palettes for low-color displays,
fractal-image support and pixel calibration. Each section of this
chapter is short, providing a quick explanation for the purpose of
the extension, and in some cases, detailed programming issues. Part
two closes with a chapter on MNG, the multi-image format cousin of
PNG. PNG doesn't handle animation formats; it wasn't designed to do
so. Chapter 12 discusses MNG in some depth, but this format is both
still evolving and fairly complex. The chapter does give a nice
overview of the format, however.</p><p>Part three is a detailed discussion of the two reference
libraries for the PNG specification, namely libpng and zlib. The
latter is the standard compression library used with PNG images.
Both libraries are freely available and not license-restricted.
Chapters 13 through 15 present a thorough programming guide to both
the libpng and zlib APIs, including numerous code examples. Chapter
16 closes the book with short notes on other libraries and
specifications of interest to the PNG programmer.</p><p>Two additional sections follow Chapter 16. The first is a
well-done, chapter by chapter bibliography (although not all
chapters have references listed). The second is a glossary of
terms. The definitions given here are quite good, most providing
more than the typical one- or two-line descriptions found in other
texts.</p><p>If it's not obvious by this point, I'll state it clearly: I
really liked this text. Personally, I don't have a major need for
information on the PNG format. Until it's more widely adopted by
the people I work with (such as publishers when asking for
screenshots or other artwork), I'll probably stick to using TIFF,
but that's not related to why I like this text. I'm a writer, and
writers perform a public function&mdash;they provide information (and/or
entertainment). Not all writers do this well, especially technical
writers. However, Greg has done a very good job with this text on
PNG. He's covered the topic well, and he's done so with an
understanding of his audience's needs. He's earned the right to
call this book <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Definitive Guide</em></span>.</p></div></div>
