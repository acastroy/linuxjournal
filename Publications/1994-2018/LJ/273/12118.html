Mars Lander Program</h4><p>
Regarding Dave Taylor's series on the Mars Lander game in the September, October and
November 2016 issues: I appreciate the way he builds the program over three months in the magazine. Is
there somewhere I can download the finished program, so I can peruse and play with
it?

Simple Server Hardening</h4><p>
I found Kyle Rankin's &ldquo;Simple Server Hardening&rdquo; article in the October 2016 issue
to be very useful, and I also look forward to
more such tips, such as hardening of services that need to be on&mdash;for example, a mail
server.
</p><p>
I have one comment: if we disable passwords altogether and allow access using SSH
keys only, is there still a need to disable root login over SSH? The problem with
reaching root via a non-root login (using sudo or SSH) is then your root is only
as secure as such a non-root login. I personally don't even have a password for root,
although I permit keys-only SSH logins to root. I would be glad if you could highlight
risks with this arrangement, as against sudo and so on.

<br><br>&mdash;<br>

</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle Rankin replies:</b></span> This is a great question. Yes, even if you disable
password login
altogether, you still should disable root login both over SSH and locally,
and use sudo instead. The core idea with requiring sudo for root access
instead of using su is that it makes it easy to revoke any individual
admin's access to root without having to change some central, shared
password. Even if you require SSH keys for login, requiring sudo still
provides extra protection in the case of a compromised key.
</p><p>
Attackers who have compromised an admin's SSH keys still have one extra
barrier to the root account: they may be able to <tt  >ssh</tt> in to a server as the
admin using the admin's key (if the admin didn't take the extra step of
password-protecting the keys), but the attackers still have to figure out
the admin's personal password to be able to <tt  >sudo</tt> to root. In
your scenario,
if your personal key were compromised, attackers would have direct access
to root on all of your machines. Scenarios like this are why it's so
important never to share personal keys between admin, password-protect
your keys, pick good passwords for sudo, and never allow users to
<tt  >sudo</tt>
up to root without their password.

Hodge Podge Comment</h4><p>
Shawn Powers' &ldquo;Hodge Podge&rdquo; article in the October 2016 issue was an
interesting article, as usual.
</p><p>
In the article, he mentioned several economical cloud options. I wonder
whether he has evaluated SDF.org (<a href="https://sdf.org" target="_self">https://sdf.org</a>). There are various tiers available to suit
various needs, the most basic costing only a one-time fee for life on a shared
cluster. There are VPS options as well at the higher end. How do these options
figure in comparison with others that he mentioned?

<span   class="bold"><b>Shawn Powers responds:</b></span>
I'd never heard of SDF.org, but when I visited the site, I couldn't find VPS options.
I did see free shell access, which is cool, but that's all I could find.

Hodge Podge Suggestion</h4><p>
In Shawn Powers' &ldquo;Hodge Podge&rdquo; article in the October
2016 issue, he mentioned his love for Synology and GPS trackers. I think I share the same
passion. In his quest for fun gadgets and programs, I would like to
introduce Traccar. I use the free program called Traccar
(<a href="http://www.traccar.org" target="_self">www.traccar.org</a>) to monitor the movements of my car. I installed the
Traccar server on my Synology and the Traccar client on an old unused
Android smartphone (with GPS). I installed the smartphone in my car and
connected the smartphone to my car battery. On the smartphone, I installed
a firewall app to minimize data traffic to and from Google (I'm not
interested in updates or other stuff). 
</p><p>
When the car is parked in the
vicinity of my house, the smartphone uses the Wi-Fi of my AP. In this way, I
minimize data traffic on my pre-paid data bundle. Only when I'm driving
around GPS coordinates are sent to the Traccar server using the pre-paid
data bundle. The client is set to an interval of one minute. Depending on
the cost of your pre-paid data bundle and the amount of travel, you
will use up $10 in several months.
</p><p>
The Traccar server stores all coordinates (of multiple devices if needed)
in a MySQL database. Via a web interface, you can locate your GPS device or
see where the GPS device, in my case my car, travels or has traveled to.
</p><p>
Next, I wrote a C-program that does a MySQL query on the Traccar database.
Whenever my car starts moving and moves beyond a pre-defined offset, the
C-program sends an email, notifying me that the car is moving. The C-program
also emails me when the car is stationary with its present position (street
name and city). The C-program is running on a Raspberry Pi next to another
beautiful program: Domoticz (<a href="https://domoticz.com" target="_self">https://domoticz.com</a>).
</p><p>
There you go&mdash;a second life for your smartphone and lots of fun.

Very cool! I wonder if the program would record and upload only while within range of
home Wi-Fi. It would be a great use for old phones and wouldn't require any cell
service at all. Either way, I'll check it out. Thanks!

Feedback on &ldquo;Low Power Wireless: 6LoWPAN, IEEE802.15.4 and the Raspberry
Pi&rdquo;</h4><p>
I'm one of the linux-wpan maintainers in the Linux kernel as well as the
wpan-tools maintainer.
</p><p>
That this project was picked up for an article series in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> was a
really nice surprise [see Jan Newmarch's articles in the November and December 2016
issues, as well as the final article in this issue].
</p><p>
Reading the first article, I have a few items I wanted to bring up:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
In the article Jan writes that the at86rf230 module needs to be
loaded manually. That should not be needed and has not been in my
testing so far. The device tree overlay he enabled should make sure that
the driver is auto-loaded as well. Maybe that's something worth checking in his
system.
</p></li><li><p>
In the Python example, he uses TCP. I really would recommend using UDP
for examples here. In his test setup, it will not make much of a
difference, but in these networks, it can be really lossy and the TCP
handshake makes things more complicated. In the end, you normally do not
need a stream protocol for these types of networks.
</p></li><li><p>
Using UDP for this example has the additional benefit that the kernel can
apply next header compression (NHC, RFC6282) for UDP. If you use the
right port range, that can save 2 bytes from the UDP header in each
packet. (The port range is reduced to only 16 ports, starting from port
61617.)
</p></li></ul></div><p>
A good article overall. Thanks for doing it and looking forward to the
next episodes.

Schmidt  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jan Newmarch responds:</b></span> Thanks Stefan!
Yes, you are right on both counts. I manually loaded the drivers in
order to test if it was working. Once confirmed, reboots and the device
tree load the drivers as needed. I should have mentioned that I 
loaded them manually only as a test and after that it no longer
would be needed.
</p><p>
I was undecided as to whether to use TCP or UDP. UDP is the protocol of
choice for low-power systems, but I thought that readers might be more
familiar with TCP programs. The RPi can handle either; it has enough
capabilities. I my third article (in this issue), I'm using the
CoAP library aiocoap, and that is UDP-based.

Holy Triage, Batman!</h4><p>

Erratum</h4><p>
I just finished reading Reuven M. Lerner's At The Forge (&ldquo;Preparing Data for
Machine Learning&rdquo;) in the November 2016 issue, which was great and had me
craving a burrito! But I noticed a typo: in
the Resources section, the Data Science Weekly newsletter URL should be
a .org and not a .com. The correct URL is <a href="http://datascienceweekly.org" target="_self">datascienceweekly.org</a>.
