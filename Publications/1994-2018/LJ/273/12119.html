<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #273, January 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Anshuman Khandual</b></span> felt that there were a lot of devices with their own
<span   class="bold"><b>RAM</b></span> in the world, and Linux should be able to allocate that memory to
users as part of the general pool, rather than letting those devices
hog it all for themselves.
</p><p>
It turns out to be hard to do this. Devices have to be initialized
before they can be used, so the general pool of RAM would have to be
grown by the kernel in a coherent way as new devices came online.
Also, unlike regular system RAM, devices can removed from the system
without warning, which poses its own set of problems.
</p><p>
There always are solutions to these sorts of problems, but they may
involve unpleasant compromises, such as increased code complexity,
speed reduction or using some areas of RAM in certain ways but not
others.
</p><p>
Sometimes there also are unexpected opportunities for collaboration
that emerge from these sorts of proposals. In this case, Anshuman
found that <span   class="bold"><b>Jerome Glisse</b></span>'s work on
<span   class="bold"><b>HMM</b></span> (heterogeneous memory
management) might be relevant, because it had the similar issue of RAM
not always being available to the general pool. Jerome suggested they
work together on finding a proper solution.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Hansen</b></span> also pointed out that the
existing projects <span   class="bold"><b>autonuma</b></span>
(automatic non-uniform memory architecture) and <span   class="bold"><b>hugetlbfs</b></span> 
were relevant to Anshuman's work, because they dealt with gathering up
available RAM and adding it to the general memory pool as well.
</p><p>
But, not all projects can be merged in this way. Sometimes developers
will make certain assumptions, or cut certain corners, because they
don't see any other way to implement the thing they need. And, sometimes a
developer on a similar project will need exactly the thing that the
first developer had been trying to avoid. That's what happened
here. <span   class="bold"><b>David Nellans</b></span>, who'd been working with Anshuman on his code,
explained that, among other things, they wanted to avoid hugetlbfs
support and concentrate on getting what they needed from <span   class="bold"><b>THP</b></span>
(transparent huge tables) instead. But, Dave objected that this would
force additional complexity into hugetlbfs&mdash;to special-case the RAM
that Dave and Anshuman were working on.
</p><p>
There was quite a technical discussion, with no explicit resolution.
This is the type of project that typically undergoes a wide-ranging
discussion that gathers participants from all parts of the kernel.
Eventually, various big-time kernel hackers may step in to adjust
folks' direction and point out uncompromisable issues or extremely
simple alternatives to complex debates.
</p><p>
A <span   class="bold"><b>ret2dir attack</b></span> is when a hostile user writes malicious code into
kernel memory, hoping to trick the kernel into executing that code at
a future date, like when a function call returns to that location.
It's similar to the <span   class="bold"><b>ret2usr attack</b></span>, in which the same general thing
occurs in user memory instead of kernel memory.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Juerg Haefliger</b></span> recently wanted to
implement <span   class="bold"><b>eXclusive Page Frame
Ownership</b></span> (XPFO), which would prevent a user from modifying RAM that
hadn't been allocated explicitly to that user. He posted some code to
do this and had a bit of a technical discussion about it with <span   class="bold"><b>Laura
Abbott</b></span>. There were no serious objections&mdash;just suggestions regarding
portability and locking efficiency. It looks like Juerg's code will go
into the kernel at some point.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Pavel Machek</b></span> felt that certain Linux
systems&mdash;particularly
smartphones&mdash;didn't do a great job when battery power became low. The
<span   class="bold"><b>Nokia N900</b></span>, he said, would run down the battery until it didn't have
enough power left to do a clean shutdown. It would just crash. Pavel
proposed adding code to detect when the battery was too low and doing
a proper shutdown in that case.
</p><p>
He posted some code to do this, but initially walked it back when <span   class="bold"><b>Tony
Lindgren</b></span> pointed out that a more configurable patch would really be
better. Specifically, he said the exact voltage that would
trigger a shutdown should depend on what would be best for any given
system. To do this, Pavel replied that a good approach would be to
create a battery object in the device tree and create configurable
properties for those objects.
</p><p>
On second thought, however, Pavel said that maybe configurability
wasn't really the thing in this case. The hardware had its own
mechanism for alerting the operating system that the battery was low
or dead, and Pavel felt that Linux simply should respect those
messages. There was no need to second guess the hardware in this case.
</p><p>
The discussion ended inconclusively, but presumably, some kind of clean
shutdown will replace the current crash behavior.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: the Verbification of Video Chat</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #273, January 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
People who study the history of languages probably will look back at our
current time and scratch their heads. We keep inventing verbs! First,
Google became the verb we use for searching. Then, &ldquo;Facebooking&rdquo; someone
became a viable way to contact them. Heck, I forgot about &ldquo;texting&rdquo;
someone. It seems we just keep taking perfectly good nouns and making
them verbs. We keep verbing all our nouns! But I digress.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, I've noticed a trend where people who want to do video
chat are starting to say, &ldquo;Facetime me.&rdquo; The problem isn't with the
terminology, it's with the proprietary technology. If you're an Android
user, you can't &ldquo;Facetime&rdquo; someone. Google Hangouts sort of solves that
problem, but it's not as user-friendly as Facetime on iOS is.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12119androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="12119androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Google hopes to change that with its new Duo app. It's designed very
much like Facetime, but it has native iOS and Android apps. In my trials,
the video quality is fine, so it's really only adoption that needs to
happen in order to become the standard across platforms. It's worth a try,
but you'll have to convince your Apple friends to install a new app for
video chatting. Also, &ldquo;duo&rdquo; doesn't really lend itself to verbification,
so I'm a little worried Google has a non-starter on that note alone!
</p></div>

<h2 class="title">Listen To Me Cheaply</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #273, January 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I listen to a lot of books. A lot. And honestly, although I've written about
the &ldquo;Listen&rdquo; app for audiobooks, I tend to use Audible more than anything
else anymore. Part of the reason is the Android app finally has more
fine-grained speed settings. (I prefer around 1.4x speed.) iPhone people
don't have that seemingly simple feature. Just saying.
</p><p>
The main reason I've been using Audible, however, is the pricing. Yes,
I'm a Platinum subscriber, so I get two credits a month. But, it's the &ldquo;add
narration&rdquo; feature on the Kindle store that really does it though. It's
often cheaper to buy the Kindle version of a book and add Audible
narration for less than the cost of the audiobook alone! That's not
always the case, but it's always worth checking. Look at my example in the
screenshots.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12119audiblef1.large.jpg"><img src="12119audiblef1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12119audiblef2.large.jpg"><img src="12119audiblef2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Yes, this book is free. But, you can add Audible Narration for
$2.99. Notice how much it would cost to buy the book outright: $21.99! Not
all books come with such a good deal, but many do. And if you add Audible
narration, the book is added to your Audible account like any other
book. You never have to read the Kindle version, but it's still nice to
have both&mdash;especially when it's cheaper than just buying the audiobook!

<h2 class="title">Low Tech High Tech</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #273, January 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Google Cardboard should be terrible. Really, it should. It's literally
made of cardboard. I remember as a kid some cereal boxes came with spy
glasses you had to cut out of the box itself&mdash;and they were terrible. But
Google Cardboard is amazing. Granted, you need to add your $750 Android
phone to it, but that's already in your pocket anyway.
</p><p>
The reason Google Cardboard can be so simple is that its only job is
to let you focus on a phone that is two inches from your face. A couple
plastic lenses held in place by a chunk of cardboard isn't terribly high
tech. But once you have that technology in place, Google Cardboard lets
you literally transport to another world. Using apps from the Google
Play Store, the VR experience is shockingly good using nothing more than
a modern Android cell phone.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12119cardf1.large.jpg"><img src="12119cardf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
The truth is, it takes a lot of graphical power to render two separate
dynamic videos on a screen at one time. (That's how it makes the
experience 3D.) So whatever VR app you download will likely have a slightly
blocky-looking world. The crazy part is, that doesn't detract from the
experience. In fact, some blocky trees almost make the experience that
much more surreal because it's <span   class="emphasis"><em>obvious</em></span> you're in a simulation. Yet,
when you turn your head, it changes like you're actually there!
</p><p>
If you want to experience some pretty cool virtual reality, but don't
want to invest in one of the expensive, Windows-centric systems like the
HTC Vive, give Google Cardboard a try. You can get the actual cardboard
goggles on Amazon, or you could spend a few more dollars to get a
plastic set that is a little more sturdy. Either way, the experience is
amazing! It's so amazing, in fact, that Google Cardboard
gets the Editors' Choice award this month. Virtual reality using the same
technology that transports pizza? Yes please!

You've probably heard about the WiFi Pineapple from Hak5. It's a
fascinating device that allows you to do some creepy pen testing. It's
the sort of tool that could be used for evil, but it's also incredibly
useful for securing networks.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12119pineapplef1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
The hardware is fairly basic and resembles an off-the-shelf router. The
multiple network interfaces really shine, however, when paired with the
operating system. The WiFi Pineapple software creates a rogue, hidden
access point that purposefully tricks clients into connecting to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>it</em></span>
instead of the AP they're usually connected to.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12119pineapplef2.large.jpg"><img src="12119pineapplef2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
It doesn't stop there, either. The software sniffs the wireless network
for clients looking for APs they know, and then creates fake SSIDs that
match what clients are looking for. Once the client associates with the
SSID it thinks it already knows, the Pineapple provides internet service,
but it also sniffs every packet along the way. Scary stuff.
</p><p>
There are many uses for the WiFi Pineapple, and many of them are white-hat sorts of things. Be warned though, because you might be connected
to someone else's WiFi Pineapple right now! To get your own piece of
dangerous awesomeness, head over to <a href="http://wifipineapple.com" target="_self">wifipineapple.com</a> now. There
is a 2.4GHz-only verison as well as a dual-frequency model.

<h2 class="title">Analyzing Videos for Fun and Profit</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #273, January 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
People's phones and all of the various sensors that may be built in to them
is a 
source of scientific data logging that almost everyone carries around.
Although the selection of sensors varies from phone to phone,
they almost all have a camera. In this article, I take a
look at a piece of software called Tracker that can be used to analyze
videos you take of experiments. 
</p><p>
You can download Tracker directly
from the project page: <a href="http://physlets.org/tracker" target="_self">physlets.org/tracker</a>. 
A lot of good documentation is available at the main website, including
examples of how you might be able to use it from the community of other
users. Tracker is written in Java, however, so you also need to
have a JVM installed on your system before you can use it. For example,
on a Debian-based system, you can install a very good JVM with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre
</pre>
</p><p>
You then can download the relevant installer for your system and run
it from a terminal window. You probably will need to make the installer
executable with a command like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod +x Tracker-4.95-linux-64bit-installer.run
</pre>
</p><p>
Don't forget to use the sudo command so that you have the correct
permissions to do the installation.
</p><p>
Once it's installed, you should have a new entry in your applications
menu system. Starting Tracker will give you a new empty project for
beginning
your video analysis. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12119trackerf1.large.jpg"><img src="12119trackerf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. When you start Tracker, you get a new empty project.
</p></div></div><p>
Although you could start analyzing your own videos immediately, you may want
to use simpler videos while learning how Tracker
works. When you ran the initial installer for Tracker, it should have
asked you whether you also wanted to install example files. Assuming you
said yes, you now can load one of those within Tracker. When you click
on the menu item File&rarr;Open File, you'll see a new window where
you can select either a movie file or a Tracker file. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12119trackerf2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The open file dialog box allows you to open movie files or
Tracker files.
</p></div></div><p>
To begin with, let's look at one of the Tracker files from the
experiments folder. In Figure 3, I have loaded the experiment
file named BallToss.trk. The main window displays the
movie that is being analyzed as part of the experiment. The pane in the
bottom right-hand side shows a table of x and y coordinates for a series
of time units. A similar table is generated for each tracked object within
the movie. In this example experiment, the only tracked object is the
ball. The top right-hand pane contains the associated plot for the data
stored in the table. This way, you can have a visual representation of
the tracked motion. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12119trackerf3.large.jpg"><img src="12119trackerf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Loading a Tracker file opens all of the parts of a previous
analysis.
</p></div></div><p>
So, what can Tracker actually track? At the bottom of the movie display is
a set of controls. If you click on the green arrow, the movie will start to
play. As it does, Tracker actually registers the movement of the tracked
object and also updates the data panes on the right-hand side.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12119trackerf4.large.jpg"><img src="12119trackerf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. As the movie progresses, Tracker updates the data panes on
the right-hand side for the tracked object.
</p></div></div><p>
Although these panes do give you lots of raw data, there really isn't any
analysis being done yet. Clicking the View&rarr;Data Tool menu item pops
open a new window where you can use this raw data to figure out what is
happening in the video.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12119trackerf5.large.jpg"><img src="12119trackerf5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The Data Tool window provides a set of analysis tools to
look at the raw data pulled from the video.
</p></div></div><p>
The Measure and Analyze buttons at the top of the plot window provide
a set of different sections that you can display. This gives you several
different analysis options for your data. Clicking the Measure
button gives you the options Coordinates, Slope and Area. When you
select one or more of those options, values are displayed
at the bottom of the plot representing each of the selected options.
</p><p>
When you click the Analyze button, you get a drop-down with the
Statistics, Curve Fits and Fourier Spectrum options. Each of
those options actually opens a new pane in the Data Tool window. The
exception is the Fourier Spectrum option. This option actually opens
a new window where a Fourier analysis is done on the raw data from the
tracked object. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12119trackerf6.large.jpg"><img src="12119trackerf6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Tracker also can do a Fourier analysis of the observed
motion.
</p></div></div><p>
The Statistics option gives the data displayed in the top right
pane. This is the set of descriptive statistics&mdash;that is, the maximum,
minimum, mean and standard deviation, among other values.
</p><p>
Selecting the Curve Fits option gives you the pane at the bottom of
the plot window. Here you can select what type of curve is being fitted
to your raw data. You can use a number of default functions 
to try to fit your data. In this case, the linear function is the
obvious choice for a fitting function. You can see the function being
used, x=A*t+B in this case, along with the calculated values for the
parameters A and B. If you are tracking an object that has a really odd
motion, you can click the Fit Builder button to pop up a new window
where you define a new fitting function. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12119trackerf7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. You define your own fitting functions as part of the data
analysis.
</p></div></div><p>
What do you do as part of a new project? Let's say you want to analyze
the pendulum video from the sample video folder. You can set some
calibration items within the video by either selecting the relevant
buttons at the top of the window or selecting the items under the menu
entry Track&rarr;New&rarr;Calibration Tools. You can set up items like a calibration
stick or a reference set of axes.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12119trackerf8.large.jpg"><img src="12119trackerf8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. You can set up calibration tools within your video to be
analyzed.
</p></div></div><p>
One way to do the analysis is to step through the video, frame by frame,
selecting the object to be tracked within each frame. This may be the only
way to collect the raw data, but humans are lazy. If the object being
tracked is relatively consistent across the duration of the video clip
in question, you can try using the autotracker. Clicking the autotracker
button will pop up a new window where you can control what is being
tracked. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12119trackerf9.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. The autotracker tries to follow an object
from frame to frame automatically.
</p></div></div><p>
Tracker helpfully displays reminder information on how to 
use the software. In this case, it reminds you that you need to
press Ctrl, Shift and left-click the mouse button on the object of
interest. If you then click the search button within the autotracker
window, it will move through each frame, looking for the object in
question. Once it is done, you should have a full set of data from the
tracked object. From the plot in Figure 10, you can see right away that
the pendulum follows the expected motion. You also can track multiple
objects by creating a new track for each object.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12119trackerf10.large.jpg"><img src="12119trackerf10.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. The autotracker can generate all of your raw data
automatically.
</p></div></div><p>
Now that you've taken a quick look at Tracker and the kind of analysis
you can do with it, you should be comfortable enough to start 
experimenting with it. Don't forget to share any interesting ideas you come
up with on the community page and add to a great resource for citizen
science.
