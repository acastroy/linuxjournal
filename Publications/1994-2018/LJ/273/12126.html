<span   class="emphasis"><em>You had to be a crank to insist on being right. Being right was largely a
matter of explanations. Intellectual man had become an explaining creature.
Fathers to children, wives to husbands, lecturers to listeners, experts to
laymen, colleagues to colleagues, doctors to patients, man to his own soul,
explained. The roots of this, the causes of the other, the source of
events, the history, the structure, the reasons why. For the most part, in
one ear out the other. The soul wanted what it wanted. It had its own
natural knowledge. It sat unhappily on superstructures of explanation, poor
bird, not knowing which way to fly.</em></span>&mdash;Saul Bellow,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mr. Sammler's Planet</em></span>, 1969.
</p><p>
I began writing this column on November 9, 2016, on the balcony of a hotel
in Istanbul, while a call to prayer echoed through the streets below. I
took that as good advice, because a few hours earlier my country elected an
Internet troll, Donald Trump, as its president
(<a href="http://scripting.com/2016/07/28/dontFeedDjTrump.html" target="_self">scripting.com/2016/07/28/dontFeedDjTrump.html</a>). Perhaps by now we're
calling this day 11/9, in the mold of 9/11. I'm an optimistic guy, but
color me pessimistic about where my country is now heading, led by a world-class narcissist.
</p><p>
And forgive me for obsessing not only about where this is going, but how we
got here. Our country has been hacked, and that matters.
</p><p>
Disclosure: I'm a political independent, and not a fan of Hillary Clinton,
though I thought she was the only sensible choice, given Trump's
shortcomings, many of which should have disqualified him, flat out. But he
won. Why?
</p><p>
I don't know, though I did see it coming. Mostly I felt it. Polls said one
thing, my senses another. &ldquo;We know more than we can tell&rdquo;, says Michael
Polanyi. Evidence: most of the time we don't know how we'll end the
sentences we start, or how we started the sentences we end. Yet we know
what we're talking about. And if we succeed, another human being gathers
our meaning, even though they can't repeat it verbatim.
</p><p>
To say something is to express some care about it. We also tend to hear
what we like to hear more than what we don't, even if we welcome what might
disagree with us. Those of us who work with logic (such as <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>
readers) have a high regard for the rational. But while logic and reason
sit on the mental board of directors, emotions cast the deciding
votes. As
Bellow says, the soul wants what it wants.
</p><p>
To see how emotions might cast deciding votes, Heartbeat AI studied
emotional leanings in five &ldquo;swing&rdquo; states: ones a candidate needs to win in
a close election (<a href="https://heartbeatai.com/#welcome-1" target="_self">https://heartbeatai.com/#welcome-1</a>). Before Election Day, ordinary polls showed Clinton
winning most or all those states. But the Heartbeat AI study showed
something very different. Here it is:
<a href="https://go.heartbeatai.com/report/client/529-241866ea30958b0b2007ffde94ddbed9" target="_self">https://go.heartbeatai.com/report/client/529-241866ea30958b0b2007ffde94ddbed9</a>. Play with it a bit. The little heart
on the right is a tab that pulls out a drawer of variables you can turn on
and off.
</p><p>
I just did that, and Figure 1 shows both candidates' sentiment maps,
together.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12126f1.large.jpg"><img src="12126f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trumps' Sentiment Maps for Five
&ldquo;Swing&rdquo; States, via Heartbeat
AI
</p></div></div><p>
Trump won all those states. Hell, somebody had to. But the main point here
is that voters disliked both candidates&mdash;a lot. They simply disliked
Trump less than they disliked Clinton&mdash;not that they actually liked Trump.
</p><p>
This kind of study doesn't show a mandate, but it does suggest caution
before suggesting that a victory by either party constituted a mandate of
any kind&mdash;or <span   class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span>, anyway.
</p><p>
It also makes one wonder how voters came to feel the way they did about the
candidates. To what degree are those feelings attached to actual facts?
Hard to tell, but wondering should be productive.
</p><p>
On September 18, 2016, I blogged this
(<a href="http://doc.blog/2016/09/18/trumpTheMule.html" target="_self">doc.blog/2016/09/18/trumpTheMule.html</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
As soon as it became clear that Trump was a breed apart, remarkable more
for his powers of persuasion and enlistment than for anything else (his
policies are all feints: magical misdirections away from his absolute
vanity), I saw him as the Mule
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule_%28Foundation%29" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule_%28Foundation%29</a>), star
of Isaac Azimov's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Foundation</em></span> series.
Here's how Wikipedia describes the Mule:
</p><p>
&ldquo;One of the greatest conquerors the galaxy has ever seen, he is a mentalic
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentalic" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentalic</a>) who has the ability to reach into
the minds of others and 'adjust' their
emotions, individually or <span   class="emphasis"><em>en masse</em></span>, using this capability to conscript
individuals to his cause. Not direct mind-control <span   class="emphasis"><em>per
se</em></span>, it is a subtle
influence of the subconscious; individuals under the Mule's influence
behave otherwise normally&mdash;logic, memories, and personality
intact.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Scott Adams more blandly calls Trump a &ldquo;master persuader&rdquo;
(<a href="http://blog.dilbert.com" target="_self">blog.dilbert.com</a>). The effect is
the same, especially if Trump wins. Which I fear. And, hate to say, expect.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Scott was right, and that surely makes Trump a much more interesting case
study than Clinton, whose only quotable line during the whole campaign was
&ldquo;basket of deplorables&rdquo;. Her relatively blah public persona also made her a
dressmaker's dummy for every adjectival characterization Trump chose to
clothe her in, just as he had done with the most threatening of the
17 Republican opponents he knocked off in the primaries (examples:
&ldquo;low-energy Jeb&rdquo;, &ldquo;little Marco&rdquo;, &ldquo;lyin'
Ted&rdquo;). Looking at the Heartbeat AI
research, it seems the one that stuck in the final round was &ldquo;Crooked
Hillary&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The high degree to which Trump was disliked, even by people who voted for
him, is nowhere in any of the prevailing narratives in election coverage,
whether by (what's left of) mainstream media or by the millions yakking
about it on Facebook and Twitter. Instead, we're mostly hearing about how
those deplorables won respect by defeating &ldquo;the elites&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Speaking of which, nearly all major newspapers sensibly opposed Trump, and
most endorsed Clinton. Even some papers that normally favor Republican
candidates either endorsed Clinton or suggested voting for anyone but
Trump. In its 126-year history, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Arizona Republic</em></span> never endorsed a
single Democrat, but inveighed in favor of Hillary Clinton for this
election
(<a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/editorial/2016/09/27/hillary-clinton-endorsement/91198668" target="_self">www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/editorial/2016/09/27/hillary-clinton-endorsement/91198668</a>), 
calling Donald Trump a &ldquo;two-bit billionaire&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/editorial/2016/01/29/donald-trump-republican-imposteropinioneditorial/79417514" target="_self">www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/editorial/2016/01/29/donald-trump-republican-imposteropinioneditorial/79417514</a>) and much worse.
</p><p>
Wikipedia's list of Republicans opposed to Trump
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Republicans_who_opposed_Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign,_2016" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Republicans_who_opposed_Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign,_2016</a>) and influencers in favor
of Clinton
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hillary_Clinton_presidential_campaign_endorsements,_2016" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hillary_Clinton_presidential_campaign_endorsements,_2016</a>) were both very long and thick with highly notable people and
institutions. None of them mattered. Trump won anyway.
</p><p>
So much for the influence of influencers&mdash;or at least influencers of the
usual kind. And it is interesting that this is all happening in a time when
the term &ldquo;influencer&rdquo; is in marketing vogue
(<a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=influencer" target="_self">https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=influencer</a>). See
Figure 2.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12126f2.large.jpg"><img src="12126f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Google Trends Results for &ldquo;Influencer&rdquo;
</p></div></div><p>
You'll see almost exactly the same result for &ldquo;influencer
marketing&rdquo;
(<a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=influencer%20marketing" target="_self">https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=influencer%20marketing</a>),
meaning that the main interest in &ldquo;influencers&rdquo; is among marketers. Not
surprisingly, if you look up &ldquo;influencer marketing&rdquo;, you'll get a load of
results (nearly a half-million in my case, at that link), nearly all of it
pitching shortcuts to earning influence. Says Wikipedia
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influencer_marketing" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influencer_marketing</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Influencer marketing</b></span> (also <span   class="bold"><b>influence marketing</b></span>) is a form of marketing
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing</a>) in
which focus is placed on specific key individuals (or types of individual,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual</a>)
rather than the target market as a whole. It identifies the individuals
that have influence over potential buyers
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buyer" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buyer</a>), and orients marketing activities
around these influencers.
</p><p>
Influencer content may be framed as testimonial advertising where they play
the role of a potential buyer themselves, or they may be third parties.
These third parties exist either in the supply chain (retailers,
manufacturers, etc.) or may be so-called value-added influencers (such as
journalists, academics, industry analysts, professional advisers, and so
on).
</p></blockquote></div><p>
As a journalist, I'm often targeted for manipulation by influence marketers.
While I ignore or reject those appeals, I am also struck by the ironic
sense that my own influence has been going down over recent years, roughly
on a path that seems to mirror the upward curve in the graph shown in
Figure 2. I am
also sure the same is true for most journalists, if not all of them.
Celebrities too. Endorsement failings in this election are just one example
of that decline at work.
</p><p>
But I think there's more going on here. Before the internet came along,
sources of authority were clear and understood. We had scientists,
researchers, think tanks and other confirming or denying sources for
claims, findings and stories told by politicians, business folk and other
suspects given to lying and exaggeration. Good journals and journalists
could be trusted to find and expose essential facts, regardless of who got
offended. Many fewer journalists are employed now, and many surviving
journals have either gone out of business or morphed into the &ldquo;content
production&rdquo; business. Most commercial publications (ours included) now show
ads that are annoying, based on unwelcome tracking, or both, which reduces
readership while eroding trust. Meanwhile, the old &ldquo;mainstream
media&rdquo; are
now just waves atop an ocean of &ldquo;content&rdquo; generated by anything and
anybody.
</p><p>
Many journalists took great heart in the promise of the net and the web,
back in the early years of both&mdash;especially how it gave everybody their
own platform for publication and participation. In <span   class="emphasis"><em>We the
Media</em></span>
(<a href="https://www.amazon.com/We-Media-Grassroots-Journalism-People/dp/0596102275" target="_self">https://www.amazon.com/We-Media-Grassroots-Journalism-People/dp/0596102275</a>), first
published in 2004, Dan Gillmor (<a href="https://dangillmor.com" target="_self">https://dangillmor.com</a>)
details the progress of &ldquo;journalism as
lecture to journalism as conversation or seminar&rdquo;. For example, take a post
I put up on October 23, 2003, titled &ldquo;Listen and Learn&rdquo;
(<a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2003/10/22#listenAndLearn" target="_self">doc.weblogs.com/2003/10/22#listenAndLearn</a>). There I visited some
of my own learning experiences with journalism's evolution in real time.
Here's an
excerpt:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I find myself thinking there are three approaches to journalism represented
here. One is the &ldquo;cool&rdquo; approach of traditional journalism, including
network broadcasting (in which NPR is no exception). One is the
&ldquo;hot&rdquo;
approach of talk radio, which has since expanded to TV sports networks and
now Fox TV. The third is the <span   class="emphasis"><em>engaged</em></span> approach of weblogging. What we're
doing here may be partisan in many cases, but it is also inconclusive.
Blogging is about making and changing minds. It's less about scoring points
against perceived enemies&mdash;with certain exception
(<a href="http://www.rageboy.com/blogger.html" target="_self">www.rageboy.com/blogger.html</a>), of course&mdash;than about
scaffolding new and better understandings of one subject or another.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Jay Rosen (<a href="https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu" target="_self">https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu</a>), a journalism professor at NYU, turned a one-liner from that
passage into the title for a follow-up post: &ldquo;Blogging is About Making and
Changing Minds&rdquo;
(<a href="http://archive.pressthink.org/2003/10/23/doc_inconclusive.html" target="_self">archive.pressthink.org/2003/10/23/doc_inconclusive.html</a>). He concludes that post with this:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The cool, neutral, professional style in journalism says: get both sides
and decide for yourself. The hotter, more partisan press says: decide for
yourself&mdash;which side?&mdash;then go get information. The weblog doesn't
want to be either of these, but it checks and it balances both.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Those days are so gone.
</p><p>
So let's return to the noise&mdash;by which I mean Facebook.
</p><p>
At issue as I write this is &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; on Facebook, which seems to have
influenced a lot of people in the election&mdash;or so says Craig Silverman in
BuzzFeed
(<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/viral-fake-election-news-outperformed-real-news-on-facebook?utm_term=.mijmqmeLNG#.qylPQP34d1" target="_self">https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/viral-fake-election-news-outperformed-real-news-on-facebook?utm_term=.mijmqmeLNG#.qylPQP34d1</a>),
king of what we might call the &ldquo;newstream&rdquo; media. Craig did a
bunch of research, most dramatically represented by the graphic shown in
Figure 3.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12126f3.large.jpg"><img src="12126f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Influence of &ldquo;Fake News&rdquo; on Facebook (from Craig
Silverman)
</p></div></div><p>
I could go on, but I'd rather not, since by now I've spent more time on
this piece than on anything I've written here in many years. (And I've been
doing that since 1996.)
</p><p>
Here's the Linux connection: <span   class="bold"><b>we need to hack news back in a logical
direction, and away from the fact-free, misleading and emotion-stirring
ways that news is made today</b></span>. The mainstream media is beyond fixing. So is
the newstream media, so long as it remains dependent on surveillance-based
advertising, clickbait and fake news of its own.
</p><p>
I don't know how we do that, but we've hacked the world before: with free
software, Linux and open source, just to name the Big Three.
</p><p>
Time to do it again.
