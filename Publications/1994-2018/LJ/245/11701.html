Learn how to use libest to deploy X.509 certificates across
your enterprise.

Have you ever found yourself in the need of an X.509 certificate when 
configuring a Linux service? Perhaps you're enabling HTTPS using 
Apache or NGINX. Maybe you're configuring IPsec between two Linux 
hosts. It's not uncommon to use on-line forums or developer blogs
to find setup instructions to meet these goals quickly. Often these
sources of information direct the reader to use a self-signed 
certificate. Such shortcuts overlook good security practices that 
should be followed as part of a sound Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) 
deployment strategy. This article proposes a solution to the problem 
of widespread deployment of X.509 certificates using Enrollment
over Secure Transport (EST). First, I provide a brief primer on PKI.
Then I give an overview of using EST to provision a certificate, 
demonstrated using both Curl and libest. Finally, I show a brief example of 
an OpenVPN deployment using certificates provisioned using EST.

PKI Primer</h2></div></div><p>
Public Key Infrastructure consists of several building blocks, including 
X.509 certificates, Certificate Authorities, Registration Authorities, 
public/private key pairs and certificate revocation lists. 
X.509 certificates are provisioned by end-entities from either an RA or 
a CA. An end-entity will use the X.509 certificate to identity itself 
to a peer when establishing a secure communication channel. 
The X.509 certificate contains a public key that another entity 
can use to verify the identity of the entity presenting the X.509 
certificate. The owner of an X.509 certificate retains the private 
key associated with the public key in its X.509 certificate. 
The private key is used only by the end-entity that owns the X.509 and
must remain confidential. Leakage of the private key compromises the
security model. 
</p><p>
X.509 certificates are the most commonly used approach for verifying 
peer identity on the Internet today. X.509 certificates are used with 
TLS, IPsec, SSH and other protocols. For example, a Web browser will 
use the X.509 certificate from a Web server to verify the identity of 
the server. This is achieved by using the public key in the 
CA certificate and the signature in the Web server certificate.
</p><p>
PKI allows for multiple layers of trust, with the root CA at the top
of the trust chain. The root CA also is called a trust anchor. 
The root CA can delegate authority to a sub-CA or an RA. The sub-CA 
or RA can provision X.509 certificates on behalf of an end-entity,
such as a Web browser or a Web server. For simplicity, this article 
is limited to showing a single layer of trust where the root CA 
generates certificates directly for the end-entities.
</p><p>
The multiple layers of trust in the PKI hierarchy are implemented 
using asymmetric cryptographic algorithms. RSA is the most common 
asymmetric algorithm used today. RSA is named after its inventors: 
Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman. RSA uses 
a public/private key pair. The X.509 certificate generated by a CA 
contains a digital signature. This signature is the encrypted output 
from the RSA algorithm. The CA will calculate the hash (for example, SHA1) of 
the certificate contents. The hash value is then encrypted using the 
CA's private RSA key. The CA also will include information about itself 
in the new certificate in the Issuer field, which allows another entity 
to know which CA generated the certificate (Figure 1). 
This becomes important when another entity needs to verify the 
authenticity of another entity's certificate.

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x220a580.0x2302778"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm</b></p><p>
Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is an asymmetric
cryptographic algorithm that can be used similar to RSA. ECDSA uses
a public/private key pair similar to RSA. However, ECDSA provides
an equivalent security level to RSA using much smaller key sizes.
As of 2014, the NIST minimum recommended RSA key size is 2048 bits.
Using an ECDSA 256-bit key provides better security than RSA 2048,
which significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be
transmitted between peers during the key exchange process of protocols
such as TLS, DTLS and IKE. This bandwidth savings is desirable for
IoT devices or other end-entities that need to minimize bandwidth
consumption over radio interfaces.
</p></div><p>
When another entity needs to verify the identity and authenticity of 
an X.509 certificate, the public key from the CA certificate is used to 
verify the X.509 certificate to be verified. The verifying identity 
calculates the hash (for example, SHA1) of the certificate, similar to how the 
CA did this when generating the certificate. Instead of using the CA 
private key, the verifying entity will use the CA public key to encrypt 
the hash result. If the public key encrypted value of the hash matches
the signature that is in the X.509 certificate, the verifying 
identity is assured that the certificate is valid and was issued by the CA.
</p><p>
Astute readers will observe that the verifying entity needs to have 
the CA public key to perform this verification process. This problem 
is commonly solved by deploying the public keys of well-known 
certificate authorities with the software that will be performing the 
verification process. This is known as out-of-band trust anchor 
deployment. Commonly used Web browsers (such as Firefox, Chrome and IE) 
follow this model. When you install the Web browser on your computer, 
the well-known CA certificates are installed with the software. When you
browse to a secure Web site, the Web browser uses this trust anchor 
of pre-installed CA certificates (containing public keys) to verify 
the X.509 certificate presented by the Web server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x220a580.0x2302a90"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>FQDN</b></p><p>
X.509 certificates should contain the Fully Qualified DNS Domain Name
(FQDN) of the entity that owns the certificate. RFC 6125 provides
guidance on how FQDN should be implemented in a PKI deployment. The
FQDN should be in either the Subject Common Name or the Subject
Alternative Name of the X.509 certificate. When an entity, such as
a Web browser, verifies the authenticity of the peer certificate,
the FQDN should be checked to ensure that it matches the hostname used
to initiate the IP connection. For example, when you browse to
https://www.foobar.org, the X.509 certificate presented by the Web
server should contain www.foobar.org in either the Subject Common
Name or Subject Alternative Name. Checking the FQDN helps mitigate
an MITM (Man In The Middle) attack.

Enrollment over Secure Transport</h2></div></div><p>
Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) is defined in RFC 7030. This 
protocol solves the challenge of PKI deployment across a large 
infrastructure. For example, RFC 7030 defines methods for both 
provisioning end-entity certificates and deploying CA public keys, 
which are required for end-entities to verify each other. This article
focuses on the client-side of solving these two challenges. Let's use 
the interop test server hosted at <a href="http://testrfc7030.cisco.com" target="_self">testrfc7030.cisco.com</a> as the 
EST server for the examples. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Note: the certificates generated by 
this test server are for demonstration purposes only and should not 
be used for production deployments.</em></span>
</p><p>
RFC 7030 defines a REST interface for various PKI operations. The first
operation is the /cacerts method, which is used by an end-entity to 
retrieve the current CA certificates. This set of CA 
certificates is called the <span   class="emphasis"><em>explicit</em></span> trust anchor. The /cacerts method is the 
first step invoked by the end-entity to ensure that the latest trust anchor
is used for subsequent EST operations. The following steps show
how to use Curl as an EST client to issue the /cacerts operation:
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Step 1:</b></span>
</p><p>
Retrieve the public CA certificate used by testrfc7030.cisco.com. 
Note: this step emulates the out-of-band deployment of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>implicit</em></span>
trust anchor:

<pre     class="programlisting">
wget http://testrfc7030.cisco.com/DST_Root_CA_X3.pem
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Step 2:</b></span>
</p><p>
Use Curl to retrieve the latest <span   class="emphasis"><em>explicit</em></span> trust anchor from the test 
server:


<pre     class="programlisting">
curl https://testrfc7030.cisco.com:8443/.well-known/est/cacerts \
    -o cacerts.p7 --cacert ./DST_Root_CA_X3.pem
</pre>
</p><p>
Note: you can use a Web browser instead of wget/Curl for steps 
1 and 2. Enter the URL shown in step 2 into your browser. Then save
the result from the Web server to your local filesystem using
the filename cacerts.p7.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Step 3:</b></span>
</p><p>
Use the OpenSSL command line to convert the trust anchor to PEM format. 
This is necessary, because the EST specification requires the /cacerts
response to be base64-encoded PKCS7. However, the PEM format is more 
commonly used:

<pre     class="programlisting">
openssl base64 -d -in cacerts.p7 | \
   openssl pkcs7 -inform DER -outform PEM \
   -print_certs -out cacerts.pem
</pre>
</p><p>
The certificate in cacerts.pem is the explicit trust anchor. You will
use this certificate later to establish a secure communication
channel between two entities. However, first you need to provision
a certificate for each entity. You'll use OpenSSL to create a 
certificate request. The certificate request is called a CSR, 
defined by the PKCS #10 specification. You'll also create your 
public/private RSA key pair when creating the CSR. You'll use 
OpenSSL to create both the CSR and the key pair.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Step 4:</b></span>
</p><p>
Generate an RSA public/private key pair for the end-entity and create 
the CSR. The CSR will become the X.509 certificate after it has been 
signed by the CA. You will be prompted to supply the values for
the Subject Name field to be placed in the X.509 certificate. These
values include the country name, state/province, locality,
organization name, common name and your e-mail address. The
common name should contain the FQDN of the entity that will
use the certificate. The challenge password and company name
are not required and can be left blank:


<pre     class="programlisting">
openssl req -new -sha256 -newkey rsa:2048 \
    -keyout privatekey.pem -keyform PEM -out csr.p10

You are about to be asked to enter information that

What you are about to enter is what is called a

Email Address []:jdoe@acme.org

Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []:
An optional company name []:
</pre>
</p><p>
Now that you have the CSR and key pair, you need to send the CSR to the
CA to have it signed and returned to you as an X.509 certificate. The
EST /simpleenroll REST method is used for this purpose. Curl can be used
again to send the CSR to the CA as a RESTful EST operation.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Step 5:</b></span>
</p><p>
Use Curl to enroll a new certificate from the test server using the 
CSR you just generated. Normally the explicit trust anchor is used
for this step. However, the test server doesn't use the explicit trust
anchor for HTTPS services. Therefore, you'll continue to use the
implicit trust anchor (DST_Root_CA_X3.pem) for this step
(note: the test CA at testrfc7030.cisco.com uses a well-known 
user name/password of estuser/estpwd):


<pre     class="programlisting">
curl https://testrfc7030.cisco.com:8443/.well-known/est/simpleenroll \
    --anyauth -u estuser:estpwd -o cert.p7 \
    --cacert ./DST_Root_CA_X3.pem --data-binary @csr.p10 \
    -H "Content-Type: application/pkcs10" 
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Step 6:</b></span>
</p><p>
If successful, the Curl command should place the new certificate in
the cert.p7 file. The EST specification requires the certificate
to be base64-encoded PKCS7. Because PEM is a more commonly used format,
you'll use OpenSSL to convert the new certificate to PEM format:

<pre     class="programlisting">
openssl base64 -d -in cert.p7 | openssl pkcs7 -inform DER \
    -outform PEM -print_certs -out cert.pem
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Step 7:</b></span>
</p><p>
Finally, use OpenSSL again to confirm the content in the certificate.
The Subject Name should contain the values you used to create the
CSR earlier:


<pre     class="programlisting">
openssl x509 -text -in cert.pem

</p><p>
At this point, you have the new certificate and associated private key. 
The certificate is in the file cert.pem. The private key is in the file 
privatekey.pem. These can be used for a variety of security protocols 
including TLS, IPsec, SSH and so on.

libest</h2></div></div><p>
Curl provides a primitive method to issue the RESTful operations of the
EST enrollment process. However, the Curl command-line options required
to enroll a new certificate securely are cumbersome and
error-prone.
Additionally, Curl is unable to perform the TLS channel binding 
requirements defined in RFC 7030 section 3.5. There is an open-source 
alternative called libest. This library supports client-side
EST operations required to provision a certificate. The libest library 
comes with a client-side command-line tool to replace the Curl commands
described earlier. Additionally, libest exposes an API when EST 
operations need to be embedded into another application. Next, I
demonstrate how use the libest CLI to enroll a certificate from the 
test server.
</p><p>
libest is available at <a href="https://github.com/cisco/libest" target="_self">https://github.com/cisco/libest</a>. It's known to 
work on popular Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu and Centos. You will
need to download, configure, compile and install libest to follow 
along. The default installation location is /usr/local/est. libest 
requires that you install the OpenSSL devel package prior to 
configuration. OpenSSL 1.0.1 or newer is required.
</p><p>
You'll use the same implicit trust anchor and CSR that you used earlier 
when using Curl as the EST client. The implicit trust anchor is located 
in DST_Root_CA_X3.pem, and the CSR is in csr.p10. 
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Step 1:</b></span>
</p><p>
Configure the trust anchor to use with libest:

<pre     class="programlisting">
export EST_OPENSSL_CACERT=DST_Root_CA_X3.pem
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Step 2:</b></span>
</p><p>
Using the same CSR used earlier with Curl in the csr.p10 file,
provision a new X.509 certificate for the CSR:

<pre     class="programlisting">
estclient -e -s testrfc7030.cisco.com -p 8443 \
    -o . -y csr.p10 -u estuser -h estpwd
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Step 3:</b></span>
</p><p>
Similar to the Curl example shown earlier, use OpenSSL to convert the 
new certificate to PEM format and confirm the contents of the 
certificate:


<pre     class="programlisting">
openssl base64 -d -in ./cert-0-0.pkcs7 | \
    openssl pkcs7 -inform DER  -print_certs -out cert.pem
openssl x509 -text -in cert.pem
</pre>
</p><p>
This enrollment procedure can be used on any number of end-entities. 
These end-entities than can use their certificate along with the 
explicit trust anchor to verify each other when establishing secure 
communications. This eliminates the need to generate self-signed 
certificates and manually copy those certificates among
end-entities.
The enrollment process could be automated using Curl or libest. 
EST can be used for certificate renewal as well, which can automate 
the process of renewing certificates that are about to expire. 
Automating the process can facilitate the shortening of certificate 
validity periods, which improves the overall security posture of a 
PKI deployment.

The Heartbleed bug in OpenSSL was a severe vulnerability in OpenSSL
that was publicly announced in April 2014. The severity of this
bug was due to the potential for leaking the X.509 private key of the
TLS server. When a private key is leaked, previously recorded
communications using the key can be compromised. For example, a
compromised TLS server may have had all communications
revealed since the private key was issued to it. It's not uncommon for
certificates to be issued for a year or longer. Imagine every
transaction you conducted with your on-line bank over the past
year being compromised. The Heartbleed bug provides motivation
to use shorter validity periods when issuing X.509 certificates.
EST can be used to automate the certificate renewal process to
avoid interruptions in service due to certificate expiry.

Using the New Certificates</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have provisioned a new certificate for the end-entity, 
the certificate can be used with a variety of protocols. Next, I show 
how the certificate can be used with OpenVPN to establish a secure 
communication channel between two Linux hosts. The certificate 
enrollment process described earlier needs to be completed on
each Linux host.
</p><p>
OpenVPN supports a wide variety of configurations. In this example ,
let's use the TLS client/server model. Two Linux hosts are required. 
OpenVPN should be installed on both systems. One host will operate as 
the TLS server for VPN services. The other host will operate as the 
TLS client. In this example, the IP address for the physical Ethernet 
interface on the server is 192.168.1.35. The TAP interface is used on 
both the client and the server for the VPN tunnel. The server TAP 
interface uses the address 10.3.0.1, while the client uses 10.3.0.2. 
The certificates provisioned using EST are configured
in the OpenVPN configuration file on each system (see Listings 1 and 2).

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
This article has focused on the minimal client-side EST operations
required to establish an explicit trust anchor and provision a new 
certificate. EST provides additional capabilities including certificate
renewal, CSR attributes and server-side key generation. EST also
provides for various client authentication methods other than
using a user name/password. The client can be authenticated using
SRP or an existing X.509 certificate. For example, an existing 
certificate on the EST client should be used when renewing
a certificate prior to expiration. A good source of 
information to learn more about these concepts is the EST
specification (RFC 7030). 
</p><p>
This article has focused on the client-side. In the future, I will
look at implementing EST on the server side to front a CA. The
EST protocol is a new protocol and not widely adopted at this time.
Several well-known commercial CA vendors are currently implementing
EST. If you use a commercial CA as part of your PKI infrastructure
today, you may want to ask your CA vendor about its plans to support
EST in the future.
