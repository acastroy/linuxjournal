Reuven describes an interesting perspective on scalable, maintainable
Web apps.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7b580.0xc73358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I often tell the students in my programming classes that back in the
1960s and 1970s, it was enough for a program to run. In the 1980s and
1990s, we needed programs not only to run, but also to run quickly. In the
modern era, programs need to run, and run quickly, but even more
crucial is that they be maintainable.
</p><p>
Of course, we don't talk much about &ldquo;programs&rdquo; any more. Now, we have
&ldquo;applications&rdquo;, or as Steve Jobs taught us to say, &ldquo;apps&rdquo;. This is
especially true for Web applications, which are a combination of many
different programs, and often different languages, as well&mdash;a
server-side language, plus SQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And, don't
forget the configuration files, which can be in XML, YAML or other
formats entirely.
</p><p>
Modern Web frameworks have tried to reduce the potential for clutter
and chaos in Web applications. Ruby on Rails was the most prominent
framework to suggest that we prefer &ldquo;convention over configuration&rdquo;, 
meaning that developers should sacrifice some freedom in naming
conventions and directory locations, if it means easier maintenance.
And indeed, when I take over someone else's Rails codebase, the fact
that the framework dictates the names and locations of many parts of
the program reduces the time it takes for me to understand and begin
improving the program.
</p><p>
Even in a Rails application though, we can expect to see many
different files and programs. Heroku, a well-known hosting company
for Web apps, looked at thousands of apps and tried to extract from
them the factors that made it more likely that they would succeed.
Their recommendations, written up by then-CTO Adam Wiggins, are known
as the &ldquo;12-factor app&rdquo;, and they describe practices that Heroku believes
will make your app more maintainable and more likely to succeed.
</p><p>
In this article, I take a look at each of the factors of a 12-factor app,
describing what they mean and how you can learn from them.
I should note that not every aspect of a 12-factor app is unique to
this set of recommendations; some of these practices have been
advisable for some time. Moreover, it's important to see these as
recommendations and food for thought, not religious doctrine.
After all, these recommendations come from examining a large number of
applications, but that doesn't mean they're a perfect match for your
specific needs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7b580.0xc737d0"></a>
1. Codebase</h2></div></div><p>
A 12-factor app has &ldquo;one codebase tracked in revision control, with
many deploys&rdquo;. I remember the days before version control, in which
we would modify Web applications on the production server. Obviously,
things have improved a great deal since then, and many (most?)
developers now understand the importance of keeping their code inside
a Git repository.
</p><p>
So, why would it be important to state this as part of a 12-factor
app?
</p><p>
It would seem that the reason is two-fold: keep everything you need
for the application inside a single repository, and don't use the
same repository for more than one app. In other words, there should
be a one-to-one correspondence between your app and the repository in
which it sits.
</p><p>
Following this advice means, among other things, that you can
distribute your app multiple times. I recently finished a project for
a client that originally had developed the software in Lotus Notes.
Now, I don't know much about Notes, but the fact is that you cannot
easily distribute an application written in Notes to new servers, let
alone to your laptop. A 12-factor app puts everything inside the
repository, dramatically reducing the work needed to deploy to a new
server or new environment.
</p><p>
The growth of Vagrant and Docker, two open-source systems that allow
for easy virtualization and containers, means that we might see this
aspect of the 12-factor app change, looking at &ldquo;containers&rdquo; rather
than &ldquo;repositories&rdquo;. Indeed, Discourse already has moved in this
direction, encouraging users to deploy within a Docker container,
rather than installing the software themselves. However, the idea
would be the same&mdash;have one configured version of the application
and then deploy it many times.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7b580.0xc73b98"></a>
2. Dependencies</h2></div></div><p>
Every program has dependencies; if nothing else, software depends on
the language in which it was written, as well as the core libraries of
that language. But if you are using an open-source language and
framework, you likely are using numerous packages. A 12-factor
app, according to the definition, explicitly declares and isolates
dependencies. That is, the application should indicate what external
libraries it uses and make it possible to change or remove those
dependencies.
</p><p>
This factor does raise the question, at least for me, of &ldquo;As opposed
to what?&rdquo; In Rails, for example, I cannot easily use a package (Ruby
gem) without explicitly mentioning it my application's Gemfile. In
Python, I need to import packages explicitly in files that use them.
To what is the 12-factor author referring when he says that we
shouldn't implicitly use external resources?
</p><p>
The author writes that apps should not &ldquo;rely on the implicit existence
of any system tools&rdquo;, going so far as to say that they should not
&ldquo;shell out&rdquo; to run external programs. As a general rule, that's
certainly a good idea; the days in which it was acceptable to open a
subshell to run external UNIX utilities are long gone. And yet, there
are times when it is necessary to do so.
</p><p>
So I have to wonder about the advice given in the 12-factor app,
saying that all external programs should be bundled with the
application, in its repository. It's a good idea to have everything
in one place, but I recently worked on a project that needed to use
the open-source PdfTk program. Did I really want to include PdfTk in
my app's repository? I expect it wouldn't even work to do that,
given the mix of Windows, Macintosh and Linux boxes among the
developers, servers and project managers working on the site.
</p><p>
Another aspect of this factor has to do with making not only the
library dependencies explicit, but also their versions. It's very easy
and tempting simply to use whatever version of a Ruby gem or Python
package is installed on a system. But without version numbers, this
can cause huge problems&mdash;the application might behave differently on
various computers, depending on what versions they have installed.
Explicitly marking versions that are known to work reduces the chance
of such trouble.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7b580.0xc73f08"></a>
3. Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
It used to be that we would, in our code, explicitly connect to a
database or to other servers from within our application. One of the
many risks associated with that practice was that if others got a
hold of our codebase, they then would have our credentials to log
in to databases and third-party services.
</p><p>
A solution has been to put such information in configuration
files that aren't committed into the code repository. How do such
files then get to the system? That's actually a bit tricky, and there
are a number of solutions to the problem.
</p><p>
One solution that has become popular, and is encouraged at
<a href="http://12factor.net" target="_self">12factor.net</a>, is the use of environment variables. That is, all of
the configuration is set in environment variables, in the deployment
user's shell or elsewhere in the system (for example, the HTTP server's
configuration file). If you don't want to set environment variables
yourself, you can use a system like &ldquo;dotenv&rdquo; to provide them for
you.
</p><p>
But it gets even better. By putting configuration settings in
environment variables, you also ensure that you can run the same code
in different environments. Want to change the credentials for a
third-party service? You don't have to touch or redeploy the code
itself. Want to connect to a different database when running your
tests? Just change an environment variable.
</p><p>
Of all of the suggestions at 12factor.net, this is the one that I
believe offers the most bang for the buck. It increases security and
increases the flexibility of your application. The trick is to
reduce, as much as possible, the number of &ldquo;if&rdquo; statements in your
code that test for such values. You want to be using whatever the
environment provides, not making conditional statements that change
the behavior based on them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7b580.0xc742d0"></a>
4. Backing Services</h2></div></div><p>
The next factor at 12factor.net says that we should use external
services as resources. This is a shift that has been happening more
and more. For example, if you ran a Web app on a standalone server ten
years ago, you would have just sent e-mail to your customers directly
from the app, using the built-in &ldquo;sendmail&rdquo; (or equivalent) program.
</p><p>
However, the rise of spam filters and the intricacies of e-mail
delivery, as well as the move toward server-oriented architectures
(SOA), has encouraged people to move away from using their own systems
and toward using separate, third-party systems. Sending e-mail, for
example, can be done via Google's Gmail servers or even through a
specialized company, such as Sendgrid.
</p><p>
Such third-party services have become increasingly common. This is
true because
networks have become faster and servers have become more reliable, but also
because it's less and less justifiable for a company to spend money on an entire
IT staff, when those functions can be outsourced to a third party.
</p><p>
In my opinion, such third-party services are an excellent way to
create an application. It allows you to focus on the parts of your
application that are special to your organization and not spend
time or effort on the configuration and tuning of external services.
However, this doesn't mean I'd want to outsource everything; in
particular, I'm not sold on the idea of third-party database servers.
Perhaps this is something I'll just have to get used to, but for
now, there are certain aspects of my apps that I'll continue to keep
in-house or at least on servers I've bought or rented.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7b580.0xc74538"></a>
5. Build, Release, Run</h2></div></div><p>
This factor says you first should build your app and then run
it&mdash;something that I would think we normally do anyway. Certainly,
deployment tools, such as Capistrano, have changed forever the way that
I think about deploying apps. As I've started to experiment with such
technologies as Chef, Puppet, Vagrant and Docker, I believe it's
only a matter of time before we see an app as a self-contained,
almost-compiled binary image that we then distribute to one or more
servers. I have heard of a growing number of companies that not only
use this approach, but that also deploy an entirely new Amazon EC2 server
with each new release. If there is a problem with the code on a
server, you just shut down the server and replace it with another one.
</p><p>
I'd generally agree that it's a bad idea to modify production code.
However, I've certainly been in situations when it was necessary to do
so, with particularly hard-to-track-down bugs that even a seemingly
identical staging system could not change. Yes, that might point to
problems with the testing environment, but when there is a crisis,
my clients generally don't want to hear clever suggestions about the
development and build process. Rather, they first want to fix the
problem and then worry about how they can avoid the same problem in
the future.
</p><p>
Nevertheless, if you aren't using a deployment tool to put your sites
out on their servers, you might want to consider that.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7b580.0xc746f0"></a>
6. Processes</h2></div></div><p>
The next factor says that the application should be one or more
stateless processes. The main implication is that the application
should be stateless, something I truly would hope has been the
case for most Web apps for some time. And yet, when I was speaking
with a Fortune 500 company several days ago, asking about the
scalability of an application that I'm building for them, they seemed
genuinely surprised to hear that we could add as many Web servers as
we wanted, because of the &ldquo;share nothing&rdquo; architecture.
</p><p>
Now, you do sometimes want to have cached memory or state for users or
other resources. In such cases, it's best to use something like
Memcached or Redis&mdash;or even a full-fledged relational database&mdash;to
keep the state. This has the advantage of not only keeping it
separate from your application, but also of sharing the data across all
the Web servers you deploy.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7b580.0xc748a8"></a>
7. Port Binding</h2></div></div><p>
This factor suggests that the application should be a
self-contained system and, thus, export itself and its services via
HTTP on a particular port. The idea here seems to be that every
application should include an HTTP server of some sort and then start
that server on a port. In this way, every Web application becomes a
resource on the Internet, available via a URL and a port.
</p><p>
I must admit that this strikes me as a bit odd. Do I really want to
see my HTTP server as part of my Web app? Probably not, so I 
don't see a good reason to include them together.
</p><p>
At the same time, I do see a strong advantage of considering each Web
application as a small SOA-style resource, which can be queried and
used from other applications. The entire Web is becoming an operating
system, and the API calls of that operating system are growing all 
the time, as new URLs expose new services. By exposing your
application as a resource, you are contributing to this new operating
system and increasing the richness of the apps that run on it.
However, I'm not convinced that where the HTTP server lies, and how
closely it is bound to the app, really affects that mindset.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7b580.0xc74ab8"></a>
8. Concurrency</h2></div></div><p>
Those of us in the Linux world are fully familiar with the idea of
creating new processes to take care of tasks. UNIX has a long history
and tradition of using processes for multitasking, and while threads
certainly exist, they're not the default way of scaling up.
</p><p>
The &ldquo;concurrency&rdquo; section of 12factor.net says that we should indeed
use processes and not be afraid to spin up processes that will handle
different aspects of our application. Each process then can run a
specialized program, which communicates with the other processes using
an API&mdash;be it a named pipe, socket, a database or even just the
filesystem.
</p><p>
True, we could use threads for some of these things. But as
12factor.net says, threads cannot be moved to a different server or
VM, whereas processes (especially if they don't contain state and
save things to a common storage facility) can.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7b580.0xc74cc8"></a>
9. Disposability</h2></div></div><p>
This aspect of 12factor.net says that we can start up or shut down an
app at any time, on any number of servers. To be honest, I'm not sure
how this is different from the existing world of Web applications. For
as long as I can remember, I was able to start up a Web app without
too much fuss and take it down with even less trouble.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Fast startup&rdquo; is a good goal to have, but it can be hard to achieve,
particularly with the overhead of many modern frameworks and
languages. If you're using a language that sits on top of the Java
virtual machine (JVM), you're likely to experience slow startup
time but very fast execution time.
</p><p>
That said, I'm not sure how important it is to be able to start up a
new copy of your application quickly, relative to other issues and
constraints. True, it's frustrating to have slow startup times,
particularly if those affect your ability to run a test suite. But
most of the time, your application will be running, not starting up&mdash;thus, I'd downplay the importance of this particular factor.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7b580.0x106d128"></a>
10. Dev/Prod Parity</h2></div></div><p>
The idea behind this factor is extremely simple but also important:
keep your development, staging and production environments as similar
as possible.
</p><p>
It's hard to exaggerate the number of times I have experienced
problems because of this. The system worked one way on my own
development machine, another way on another programmer's machine, a
third way on the staging server and a fourth way on the production
machine. Such a situation is asking for trouble. It means that even
if you have excellent test coverage of your application, you're likely
to experience hard-to-debug problems that have to do with the
configuration or the inherent differences between operating-system
versions.
</p><p>
Once again, an increasingly popular solution to this problem is to use
a virtual machine and/or a container. With a Vagrant VM, for example,
you can share the same machine, not just the same environment, among
all developers and servers. Working in this way saves time and
reliability, although it does admittedly have some negative effect on
the performance of the system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7b580.0x106d2e0"></a>
11. Logs</h2></div></div><p>
I love logs and sending data to them. In a small application, it's
enough to have a single logfile on the filesystem. But if you're
using a read-only system (such as Heroku), or if you are going to create
and remove servers on a regular basis with Chef or Puppet, or if you
have multiple servers, you will likely want to have logs as an
external service.
</p><p>
Now, old-time UNIX users might say that syslog is a good solution for
this. And indeed, syslog is fairly flexible and allows you to use
one system as the logging server, with the others acting as clients.
</p><p>
The 12-factor suggestion is to go one step further than this, treating
a log as a writable event stream to which you send all of your data.
Where does it go? It might be syslog, but it's more likely going to
be a third-party service, which will allow you to search and filter
through the logs more easily than would be possible in simple text
files.
</p><p>
I must admit there's still come comfort in my being able to run a
<tt  >tail -f</tt> on a textual logfile or <tt  >grep</tt> on a file that's
of interest to me. But I have used some third-party logging
solutions, such as Papertrail, and have come away impressed. There
also are open-source solutions, such as Greylog2, which some of my
clients have used to great satisfaction.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7b580.0x106d5f8"></a>
12. Admin Processes</h2></div></div><p>
The final factor in a 12-factor app is that of administrative
processes. Now, I often compare a Web app to a hotel, in that the end
user sees only the minority of the actual workings. Just as guests
never see the kitchen, laundry or administrative offices of a hotel,
users of a Web app never see the administrative pages, which 
often can be extensive, powerful and important.
</p><p>
However, the 12-factor app prescription for admin processes isn't
about administrative parts of the site. Rather, it's about the
administrative tasks that you need to do, such as updating the
database. This factor says that you really should have a REPL (that is, a read-eval-print loop, aka an interactive shell), and that you can
put many administrative tasks into small programs that execute.
</p><p>
I agree that a REPL is one of the most powerful and important aspects
of the languages I typically use. And I love database migrations, as
opposed to manual tinkering with the database that always can lead to
problems. However, I'm not sure if this warrants inclusion as a crucial
component of a maintainable Web application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7b580.0x106d7b0"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I see the 12-factor app as a great way to think about Web
applications and often to increase their stability and
maintainability. In some ways, I see it as similar to design
patterns, in that we have gained a language that allows us to
communicate with others about our technical design in a way that all
can agree on. However, as with design patterns, it's important to see
this as a tool, not a religion. Consider your needs, take the 12-factor
app prescriptions into account, and apply as necessary. If all goes
well, your app will end up being more scalable, reliable and
maintainable.
