Are we going to get real about privacy for everybody&mdash;or just hunker in our
own bunkers?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x189b580.0x1993300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I'm writing this in a hotel room entered through two doors. The hall door
is the normal kind: you stick a card in a slot, a light turns green, and the
door unlocks. The inner one is three inches thick, has no lock and serves a
single purpose: protection from an explosion. This grace is typical of many
war-zone prophylaxes here in Tel Aviv, Israel's second-largest city.
The attacks come in cycles, and the one going on now (in mid-July 2014) is at a
peak. Sirens go off several times a day, warning of incoming rockets from
Gaza. When that happens, people stop what they're doing and head for
shelters. If they're driving, they get out of their cars and lie on the
ground with their heads covered.
</p><p>
Since I got here, I have joined those throngs three times in small,
claustrophobia-inducing shelters&mdash;once in my hotel, once in an
apartment house where I was visiting friends and once in a bunker entered
through a men's room at the beach. After gathering behind a heavy door,
everyone in the shelter tensely but cheerfully waits to hear a
&ldquo;boom&rdquo; or
two, then pauses another few minutes to give shrapnel enough time to finish
falling to the ground. Then they go outside and return to whatever they
were doing before the interruption.
</p><p>
But not everybody bothers with the shelters. Some go outside and look at
the sky. I was one of those when I shot the photo shown in Figure 1 from the front porch of
my hotel, a few moments after hearing a pair of booms.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11735f1.large.jpg"><img src="11735f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Two incoming Hamas rockets from Gaza, intercepted by four Israeli
missiles.
</p></div></div><p>
The photo tells a story in smoke of two incoming Hamas rockets from Gaza,
intercepted by four Israeli missiles. The round puffs of smoke mark the
exploded rockets. The parallel trails mark the paths of the interceptors.
These are examples of the &ldquo;Iron Dome&rdquo;
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Dome" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Dome</a>) at work.
</p><p>
People here monitor rocket attacks using a free mobile app called Red Alert.
The one on my phone tells me there were 27 rocket
attacks fired from Gaza on Israel yesterday, including the long-range ones
I saw intercepted over Tel Aviv. (Most are short-range ones targeted at
cities closer to Gaza.)

Meanwhile, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> and its readers also
are under an attack (<a href="http://daserste.ndr.de/panorama/xkeyscorerules100.txt" target="_self">daserste.ndr.de/panorama/xkeyscorerules100.txt</a>), of
sorts, by the NSA. Here are the crosshairs at which we sit, in an NSA
surveillance system called XKEYSCORE:

Those details come via a story on the German site Tagesshau
(<a href="http://www.tagesschau.de/inland/nsa-xkeyscore-100.html" target="_self">www.tagesschau.de/inland/nsa-xkeyscore-100.html</a>). On
our Web site,
Kyle Rankin explains what's going on 
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/nsa-linux-journal-extremist-forum-and-its-readers-get-flagged-extra-surveillance" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/nsa-linux-journal-extremist-forum-and-its-readers-get-flagged-extra-surveillance</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
XKEYSCORE uses specific selectors to flag traffic, and the article reveals
that Web searches for Tor and Tails&mdash;software I've covered here in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> that helps to protect a user's anonymity and privacy on the
Internet&mdash;are among the selectors that will flag you as
&ldquo;extremist&rdquo; and
targeted for further surveillance. If you just consider how many <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> readers have read our Tor and Tails coverage in the magazine, that
alone would flag quite a few innocent people as extremist.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
BoingBoing also was targeted. Writes Cory Doctorow
(<a href="http://boingboing.net/2014/07/03/if-you-read-boing-boing-the-n.html" target="_self">boingboing.net/2014/07/03/if-you-read-boing-boing-the-n.html</a>),
&ldquo;Tor and Tails have
been part of the mainstream discussion of online security, surveillance and
privacy for years. It's nothing short of bizarre to place people under
suspicion for searching for these terms.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Both kinds of attacks bring defensive responses. In the physical space
above Israel, Iron Dome is fully developed and amazingly effective. In the
cyber space surrounding us all on the Net, we have little to protect us
from unwelcome surveillance. As the XKEYSCORE story shows, just looking for
effective privacy help (such as Tor and Tails provide) places one under
suspicion.
</p><p>
My current road trip began in London, where there are surveillance cameras
in nearly all public spaces. These were used to identify the perpetrators
of the bombings on July 21, 2005
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_July_2005_London_bombings" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_July_2005_London_bombings</a>). Similar cameras also identified suspects
in the Boston Marathon bombings of April 15, 2013
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_bombing" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_bombing</a>). It is essential to note,
however, that these cameras are not in people's homes, cars and other
private spaces (at least not yet).
</p><p>
Our problem with the Net is that it is an entirely public space. In that
space, Tor (<a href="https://www.torproject.org" target="_self">https://www.torproject.org</a>) and Tails (<a href="https://tails.boum.org" target="_self">https://tails.boum.org</a>) are invisibility cloaks, rather than the cyber
equivalents of clothing, doors, windows and other well-understood and
widely used ways of creating and maintaining private spaces.
</p><p>
We do have some degree of privacy on our computers and hard drives when
they are disconnected from the Net and through public key cryptography
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_cryptography" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_cryptography</a>)
when we communicate with each other through the Net. But both are primitive
stuff&mdash;the cyber equivalents of cave dwellings and sneaking about at
night wearing bear skins.
</p><p>
It should help to recognize that we've been developing privacy technologies
in the physical world for dozens of thousands of years, while we've only
had today's version of cyber space since 1995, when ISPs, graphical
browsers and the commercial Web first came together.
</p><p>
But living in early days is no excuse for not thinking outside the boxes
we've already built for ourselves. Maybe now that wizards are in the
crosshairs&mdash;and not just the muggles&mdash;we'll do that.
</p><p>
Got some examples? Let's have them.
