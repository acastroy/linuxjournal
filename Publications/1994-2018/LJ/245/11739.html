Open-source advocates tend to make for rotten magicians. Whereas most
illusionists insist on taking their secrets to the grave, we tend to give
away the secret sauce to anyone who'll listen. Heck, sometimes we create
things just so we can explain to others how they work! And, that is how this
issue was born. We love the How-To concept. Heck, our entire magazine is
based on the idea of spreading knowledge, and this month, we specifically
go out of our way to show not only the result, but the &ldquo;How&rdquo; as well.
</p><p>
Reuven M. Lerner starts us off with a discussion of 12-Factor Apps. He basically describes a
process for developing scalable, maintainable Web applications. As someone
who recently started creating Web apps, I can attest that they get
unmanageable quickly! Dave Taylor follows with some smarter code for
solving the &ldquo;how many days have passed&rdquo; script he's been working with for
the past few months.
</p><p>
All too often, our perfectly crafted solutions get ruined by someone
changing something outside our control. Kyle Rankin recently had an
issue with his fetchmail setup, and he walks through the process of
troubleshooting and problem solving when someone changes the rules. If,
like me, you're a fan of Kyle's passion for the command line, you'll
appreciate his efforts to maintain his ASCII lifestyle.
</p><p>
I made true on my promise to get a little more serious this month and
wrote about DNSMasq. It's not a new program, but it's so powerful and so
simple, it's often overlooked as a viable option for serving DNS and DHCP.
Although most people are fine with running DNS and DHCP from their
off-the-shelf routers, there are times when you need to run one or both of
the services on a server. That's just what I needed to do, and I was
pleasantly surprised at how powerful the little d&aelig;mon can be!
</p><p>
Much like car alarms, self-signed SSL certificates are all too often just
accepted, especially on systems we're familiar with using. The problem is
that if there is a compromise on one of our trusted systems, an invalid
certificate might be the only warning we get. John Foley walks through
the entire process for using PKI certificates. Whether you are an old hand
at creating certs for VPNs or just copy/paste something from Google
whenever you need to create a Web cert, his article is interesting and
educational.
</p><p>
Last year you may recall I mentioned ownCloud as an alternative to Dropbox
for those willing and able to host such a service on their own. Mike Diehl
takes it to the next level with an incredible how-to on setting up,
configuring and using ownCloud for all your cloud-based needs. At its
core, ownCloud does indeed sync files, but it does so much more, it's worth
taking a look at. And when it comes to file storage on your server, Russell
Coker addresses another extremely important topic: data corruption. Using
ZFS or BTRFS filesystems can protect your data, but which is better? Which
should you choose? Russell answers all your questions and more.
</p><p>
If there's one product that fits into our How-To issue, it's the Raspberry
Pi. It's the heart of just about every Linux-based DIY project on the
Internet, and those little beauties run half the projects around my
house as well. A quartet of authors (Vasilis Nicolaou, Angelos Georgiadis,
Georgios Chairepetis and Andreas Galazis) give us a great description
of pi-web-agent. Although the little RPi devices are incredible, they
also are a bit intimidating for new Linux users. pi-web-agent changes that
by providing a complete Web front end for managing and controlling the
Raspberry Pi, making the RPi accessible to everyone!
</p><p>
If you've ever wanted to work with Linux, but weren't sure &ldquo;how
to&rdquo; get
started, this issue is for you. And if you're an old hat who wants to add
more skills to your tech quiver? Again, for you too. To be honest, the
entire Linux community is based on sharing information and collaborating
ideas. There's no illusion at play, but there's plenty of magic!
