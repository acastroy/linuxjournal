CoreOS Managed Linux</h2></div></div><p>
The team at CoreOS recently announced three big, concurrent news items.
First, CoreOS rolled out its two flagship products: CoreOS Managed Linux,
which bills as &ldquo;the world's first OS as a Service&rdquo;, and
CoreUpdate, which provides a dashboard for full control of rolling updates.
Second, CoreOS announced the receipt of $8 million in funding from the
venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caulfield and Byer, meaning you are
sure to hear more about CoreOS in the future. Capital is following this
development because companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter and others
must run their services at scale with high resilience. The solution is
CoreOS, a new Linux OS that has been re-architected to provide the
foundation of warehouse-scale computing. CoreOS customers receive a
continuous stream of updates and patches (via CoreUpdate), as well as a
high level of commercial support, eliminating the need for major OS
migrations every few years. The goal is to make the migration to CoreOS's
products the last migration they ever need. Included platforms
are Bare Metal, Amazon, Google and Rackspace, among others.

Open-E JupiterDSS</h2></div></div><p>
The latest release of the Open-E JupiterDSS&mdash;or Defined Data Storage
Software&mdash;is a result of three years of development, testing, working
closely with partners and integrating customer feedback, reported maker
Open-E. The firm added that Open-E JupiterDSS provides enterprise users the
highest level of performance with unlimited capacity and volume size.
Delivered through Open-E certified partners as a software-defined storage
system, Open-E JupiterDSS comes complete with advanced features, including
thin provisioning, compression and de-duplication. This milestone release
of the company's flagship application comes in response to customers
demanding ever larger storage environments while maintaining high
benchmarks for quality, reliability, performance and price. Open-E
JupiterDSS features a ZFS- and Linux-based storage operating system.

Brian Ward's <span   class="emphasis"><em>How Linux Works</em></span> (No Starch Press)</h2></div></div><p>
Though there now exists a seemingly limitless list of great Linux books,
those like Brian Ward's <span   class="emphasis"><em>How Linux Works: What Every Superuser
Should Know</em></span>
are the kind of books that should go into the &ldquo;Linux Beginner's
Canon&rdquo;.
Ward's book contains the essentials that new enthusiasts should know as
they embark on their journey of Linux discovery. To truly master Linux and
avoid obstacles, one needs to understand Linux internals like how the
system boots, how networking works and what the kernel actually does. In
this completely revised second edition, author Ward makes the concepts
behind Linux internals accessible to anyone who wants to understand them.
Inside these information-packed pages, readers will find the kind of
knowledge that normally comes from years of experience doing things the
hard way, including essential topics like Linux booting; how the kernel
manages devices, device drivers and processes; how networking, interfaces,
firewalls and servers work; and how development tools, shared libraries
and shell scripts work. Publisher No Starch Press notes that the book's
combination of background, theory, real-world examples and patient
explanations will teach readers to understand and customize their systems,
solve pesky problems and take control of their OS.

QLogic's NetXtreme II 10Gb Ethernet Adapters</h2></div></div><p>
As part of its mission to be the most comprehensive supplier of network
infrastructure across IBM's entire server portfolio, QLogic recently
released the NetXtreme II 10Gb Ethernet adapter line, which the firm claims
is the first for IBM Power Systems. Available in 10GBASE-T or SFP+
versions, QLogic 10GbE adapters are critical for achieving desired levels
of performance and consolidation for cloud computing, convergence and
data-intensive application environments, such as video and social-media
content. Migration to the new adapters is seamless, says QLogic, because of
the full backward-compatibility with an installed base of millions of 1GbE
twisted-pair switch ports. For applications requiring leading-edge
networking performance, QLogic NetXtreme II SFP+ low-profile adapters
combine advanced, multiprotocol offload technologies with standard Ethernet
functionality.

The Icinga Project's Icinga 2</h2></div></div><p>
Although the Icinga 2 monitoring solution is backward-compatible to Nagios
and Icinga 1, the Icinga Project considers its latest masterpiece &ldquo;a
league apart from its predecessors&rdquo;. Icinga 2 is a next-generation
open-source monitoring solution designed to meet modern IT infrastructure
needs. Built from scratch and based on C++, Icinga 2 boasts multi-threaded
architecture for high-performance monitoring, a new dynamic configuration
format and distributed monitoring out of the box. Version 2 also features
multiple back ends for easy integration of popular add-ons. In contrast to
its predecessors, core features and their related libraries are shipped
with the application and can be activated as needed via
&ldquo;icinga2-enable-feature&rdquo; soft link commands, easing installation
and extension, enabling multi-functionality and improving performance.
Additional new advancements include cluster stacks, a new object-based
template-driven configuration format and extensive documentation, as well
as configuration validation and syntax highlighting to support
troubleshooting.

Zentyal Server</h2></div></div><p>
What's special about the upgraded Zentyal Server 3.5 is that it integrates
both the complex Samba and OpenChange technologies, making it easy to
integrate Zentyal into an existing Windows environment and carry out
phased, transparent migration to Linux. In other words, the Zentyal Linux
Small Business
Server offers a native drop-in replacement for Windows Small Business
Server and Microsoft Exchange Server that can be set up in less than 30
minutes and is both easy to use and affordable. Because Zentyal Server's
3.5 release focuses on providing a stable server edition with simplified
architecture, it comes with a single LDAP implementation based on Samba4,
helping solve a number of synchronization issues caused by having two
LDAP implementations in the earlier editions. In addition, a number of
modules have been removed in order to advance the core goal of offering the
aforementioned drop-in Windows server replacement capabilities.

Dave Seff's Mastering 3D Printing LiveLessons&mdash;Video Training
(Addison-Wesley Professional)</h2></div></div><p>
The conditions are riper than ever to learn about 3-D printing, especially
thanks to a new video training program called Mastering 3D Printing
LiveLessons from Addison-Wesley Professional. What's special for our
readers is that the instructor, Dave Seff, is a modern-day Goethe-esque
geek, a Linux/UNIX engineer who also has mastered topics as varied as
computer and mechanical design, machining, electronics and computer
programming. Seff has even built several of his own 3-D printers and other
CNC machines. In the videos, Seff not only teaches the fundamentals of 3-D
printing but also does so utilizing the open-source modeling software, Blender.
Seff explores how to create a 3-D model (beginner and advanced lessons),
how to slice (prepare for printing) and then how to print a 3-D model. Seff also covers
troubleshooting problems when they arise.

Nevercenter's Silo 3D Modeler</h2></div></div><p>
In response to its number-one request, Nevercenter, has ported version 2.3
of its Silo 3D Modeler application to Linux, complementing the existing Mac
OS and Windows editions. Silo, popular with designers of video games,
movies and 3-D architectural applications, can be used as either a
standalone tool or as a versatile element of a multi-application 3-D
graphics workflow. Nevercenter is finding ever more studios and individuals
in this space moving to Linux. Silo's internals also have received
significant updates, including an updated windowing system and bug fixes
across all platforms, as well as added support for .stl import.
