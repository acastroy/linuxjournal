I love to learn. I've always been a learner, so grade school and
college were both extremely enjoyable for me. That doesn't mean I always
got the best grades, because I never really cared about how successful I
was; I just cared that I absorbed more knowledge and skills. When I was in
college (early 1990s), the Internet came into its own, and my insatiable
desire for knowledge found its Holy Grail. This issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> is
dedicated to learning how to do things. If you're like me, that's an
awesome prospect, so I won't delay with lots of pontificating.

Reuven M. Lerner starts the issue by discussing what it means to be
&ldquo;fast&rdquo;
in the world of Web applications. It seems like a simple topic, but
since speed can refer to many things, and those things can be affected by
even more things, it can become complicated fairly quickly. Reuven helps
you
figure out how to go about speeding up your applications by identifying what
you actually should be trying to do in the first place.

In Dave Taylor's scripting column, you'll learn how to play with blocks. No,
not blocks of data&mdash;children's letter blocks. Whether you want
to spell out silly messages to your kids or just want to know how many
various words you could spell with a limited number of blocks, Dave's column this
month aims to please. Kyle Rankin follows Dave with his final article in
his four-part series on 3D printing. He's covered a lot during the past few
months, and this final article brings it all together with a how-to on
using OctoPrint. It's a great Web-based program for controlling your
printer, and if you're thinking about delving into the world of 3D
printing, you'll want to catch Kyle's latest installment.

It gives me a great amount of joy seeing space exploration once again
gaining popularity in our society. I worried the end of the Space Shuttle
program would start a dry spell for NASA, and although NASA's budget is
continually slashed, it hasn't stopped interest in space. Last month's
Perseid meteor shower, the recent flyby of Pluto and even the upcoming
movie <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Martian</em></span> inspired me to write about how to use your computer to
help enjoy the cosmos. Being Linux users doesn't hinder you from using
software to view the stars, and in this month's column, I discuss the
various applications available to aid in your nighttime up-looking
or your ability to explore space from your monitor. By the time you read
this, the software likely will have updated images from Pluto, so be sure
to check it out if you're a space nut like me!

Anyone who has ever been frustrated with UEFI Secure Boot will want to read
Greig Paul and James Irvine's article on how to bend UEFI to your will. If
you take control of its security features, you can protect your entire
system by encrypting the entire disk. I love turning problems into
opportunities, and this month, Greig and James provide a perfect opportunity
to do just that.

Charles Fisher finishes out this how-to issue with a very important look at
hardening TLS and SSH encryption. Thanks to recent exploits, it's painfully
obvious that the old reliable SSL encryption is no longer secure. At all.
Even SSLv3 has been proven insecure, and so you need to know what to do
to keep your data safe. Charles covers the nitty-gritty information
on not only what versions of TLS encryption you should be using, but what
ciphers are currently reliable. If you're interested in encryption, or are
responsible for securing data on your network, be sure to read his article,
as it gives a helpful, if sobering, look at the current state of encryption
software.

This issue, like every issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, has many other articles,
tips, reviews and community announcements. If you're a lifelong learner
like me (and if you're reading <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, the chances are fairly good
you are), you'll find this issue particularly enjoyable. At the very least,
hopefully my article will give you a reason to go outside and look to the
stars. Looking into the heavens always reminds me just how much there is to
learn and discover.
