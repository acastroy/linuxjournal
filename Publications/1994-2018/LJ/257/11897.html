The Qt Company's Qt</h2></div></div><p>
The motto for the Qt Company is simple: &ldquo;Code less. Create more. Deploy
everywhere.&rdquo; It's a sensible leitmotif given that the company made
the new Qt 5.5, the upgraded C++-based framework of libraries and tools for
developing powerful, interactive and cross-platform applications and
devices. Qt's support for multiple desktop, embedded and mobile
operating systems allows developers to save significant time on application
and device development simply by reusing one code. The most notable
innovations in Qt 5.5 are the following: full Bluetooth Low Energy for Internet of Things
deployments, a pre-built version of Qt for RHEL 6.6 and preliminary
support for upcoming Windows 10 (full subsequent support to follow
with a patch release). Other new features include extended support for
multimedia and graphics creation with 3D capabilities as well as new
multi-screen and IoT development features that strengthen overall
performance across applications and devices.

IBM Research Alliance's 7nm Node Chips</h2></div></div><p>
The secret to packing a whopping 20 billion transistors onto a
fingernail-sized chip involves a combination of Silicon Germanium (SiGe)
channel transistors and Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography integration.
This formula, championed by an alliance led by IBM Research, is billed as
the semiconductor industry's first 7nm node chip with functioning
transistors. Today, microprocessors leverage 22nm and 14nm technologies,
and 10nm is on its way to maturity. The new 7nm technology in the IBM
consortium's test chips is considered critical to meeting the
anticipated demands of future cloud computing and Big Data systems,
cognitive computing, mobile products and other emerging technologies. Other
partners in the public-private consortium include GLOBALFOUNDRIES, Samsung
and the SUNY Polytechnic Institute's Colleges of Nanoscale Science and
Engineering.

Astragon Software &amp; kunst-stoff's <span   class="emphasis"><em>TruckSim</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
Who knows which side of you will like <span   class="emphasis"><em>TruckSim</em></span> best&mdash;the truck geek, the
sim lover, the Europhile or maybe all three equally!
<span   class="emphasis"><em>TruckSim</em></span> is a new
truck simulation game for Android and iOS devices from the team of game
publisher and sim specialist Astragon Software and game developer
kunst-stoff. In <span   class="emphasis"><em>TruckSim</em></span>, players play the role of a small freight
forwarder seeking to build a company and vehicle fleet into a dominating
agency by fulfilling steadily bigger delivery orders from customers
throughout Europe. Varied missions will lead &ldquo;simmers&rdquo; across miles
of highway to metropolises all over the continent, each easily recognizable
by faithfully re-created landmarks. The biggest attention to detail,
however, is of given to the faithfully modeled trucks and trailers in the
TGX and TGS model range from popular German maker MAN.

Chalmers University of Technology's Graphene-Based Cooling Film</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>'s &ldquo;Future New Products&rdquo; desk is reporting on a
new development out of Sweden's Chalmers University of Technology: a
graphene-based film for efficiently cooling electronics that is attachable
to components made of silicon. The graphene film has a thermal conductivity
capacity that is four times that of copper. Until recently, the methods in
place for utilizing graphene for cooling have proven problematic, such as with
adhesiveness, when presented with high amounts of heat. This advancement at
Chalmers involves the creation of strong covalent bonds between the
graphene film and the silicon surface through the addition of
property-altering (3-Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) molecules.
Moreover, functionalization using silane coupling doubles the thermal
conductivity of the graphene. While copper has a thermal conductivity
value of 401 W/mK, the Chalmers graphene-based solution boasts 1600
W/mK. The results were recently published in the journal <span   class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Functional
Materials</em></span>.

Brian McLaughlin's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The BeagleBone Black Primer</em></span> (Que)</h2></div></div><p>
If you're looking for a comprehensive, hands-on guide to creating
projects on the slick BeagleBone Black embedded development platform, your
moment has arrived. Brian McLaughlin, a developer at NASA, has penned said
guide: <span   class="emphasis"><em>The BeagleBone Black Primer</em></span> from publisher Que. Millions of DIYers,
makers, hobbyists and engineers are discovering the fun and utility of
BeagleBone Black. Users of the platform can boot a full Linux operating
system in less than ten seconds and start developing in less than five minutes
with just a single USB cable. Author McLaughlin first reviews the basic
embedded programming concepts and techniques that every hardware developer
needs to know and then introduces the BeagleBone Black hardware. In the
course of the book, McLaughlin guides readers step by step to mastery of
increasingly advanced BeagleBone Black programming techniques using the
Cloud9 IDE and BoneScript. Throughout, McLaughlin offers both
&ldquo;starter&rdquo; and &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; projects, as well as
&ldquo;jumping-off points&rdquo; carefully conceived to encourage the
reader's own creativity.

Arduino Srl's Arduino Studio</h2></div></div><p>
In the dynamic open-source development platform space there is also a
&ldquo;birth&rdquo; to announce. Arduino Srl (aka Arduino.org), the maker of
the popular Arduino microcontroller-based open-source board kits, recently
announced the release of a new, bouncing-baby integrated development
environment called Arduino Studio. Arduino Studio is a development
environment that is completely open source and dedicated to the Arduino programming
language. The company describes the IDE as &ldquo;simple, practical
and versatile, enabling [users] to take advantage of the characteristics
and potential of Adobe Brackets Editor&rdquo;. Arduino Studio is an IDE for
all environments, and it is available for Linux, Windows, Mac OS or as
a Bracket extension. Furthermore, the IDE can be utilized not just on
standalone PCs, but also in Web/cloud mode, via browser or embedded on
Arduino boards. Arduino Studio is open to contributions from the community
for new functions, libraries and themes.

Rick Umali's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learn Git in a Month of Lunches</em></span> (Manning Publications
Co.)</h2></div></div><p>
Make the hour spent stuffing your face with food productive time with Rick
Umali's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learn Git in a Month of Lunches</em></span>. In this novel
&ldquo;study while dining&rdquo; format, Umali helps those hungry for knowledge
of the diverse and sprawling beast that is Git, the source code control
system preferred by distributed development teams. Each easy-to-follow
lesson on the discipline of source code control using Git is designed to
take an hour or less. The author's goal is to distill Git down to the
essential concepts and techniques that users need to get the most out of it
with a focus on stuff they'll likely use every day. Rather than cover a
shallow introduction to Git's massive surface area, readers will find a
road map to the commands and processes that they need to be instantly
productive.

NVIDIA OpenACC Toolkit</h2></div></div><p>
It is not that computing cores aren't getting faster. Instead,
processors are getting more parallel, which is a trend that is likely to
continue. To harness advances in parallel computing, NVIDIA and its
partners developed the OpenACC standard, which NVIDIA says &ldquo;simplifies
parallel programming for modern processors, like GPUs&rdquo;. In order to
simplify access to OpenACC for researchers, NVIDIA has released the new
NVIDIA OpenACC Toolkit, a free, all-in-one suite of OpenACC parallel
programming tools. NVIDIA claims that scientists can do &ldquo;more science,
less programming&rdquo; from the solution, which features &ldquo;the
industry-leading&rdquo; PGI Accelerator Fortran/C Workstation Compiler Suite
for Linux. The compiler is free to academic developers and researchers. The
toolkit also includes the NVProf Profiler, which gives guidance on where to
add OpenACC &ldquo;directives&rdquo;&mdash;that is, simple compiler hints to accelerate
code, as well as simple, real-world code samples.
