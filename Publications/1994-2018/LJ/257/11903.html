Control your 3D printer from anywhere in your house with a
Raspberry Pi.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2562580.0x265a3b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This is the last article in a four-part series on the current state
of 3D printing. In the first part, I gave an overall introduction to
differences in 3D printing since I wrote my original articles on 3D printing
three years ago. The second piece focused on advances in 3D printing
hardware, and the third column covered 3D printing software. In that
last article, I mentioned one particular piece of 3D printing software,
OctoPrint, that I felt warranted its own article, so I am devoting this
final article to how to set up and use OctoPrint.
</p><p>
In the past, the process to print a 3D object involved creating or
downloading a 3D model in STL format, using slicing software to convert
that STL file to the GCODE language your printer understood, and then
using other host software that knew how to communicate to the printer
(like Pronterface) to load that GCODE and send it to the printer. More
recently, there has been software that combines the slicing and host software
into one interface (like Cura), and while that's certainly convenient,
it also means that the computer you have connected to the 3D printer
to control it must stay connected throughout the entire print.
</p><p>
Although many printers these days support loading GCODE onto an SD card
for &ldquo;headless&rdquo; printing, in my opinion, OctoPrint is an even better
approach. OctoPrint combines 3D printer control software with a Web
interface so you can control your printer and monitor its progress over
the network. Even better, although OctoPrint can run on any Linux machine,
the OctoPi distribution is a customized SD card image designed to run
OctoPrint off a Raspberry Pi. Since most geeks tend to have a Raspberry
Pi lying around (and if you don't, it's relatively inexpensive compared
to a full-fledged computer), this makes for an easy way to control your
3D printer from anywhere in the house.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2562580.0x265a6c8"></a>
The Installation</h2></div></div><p>
To get started with the installation, you need to
download OctoPrint. The official downloads page is at
<a href="http://octoprint.org/download" target="_self">octoprint.org/download</a>, and you can find links to the source
package and the GitHub repository there. I'm going to assume that
the majority of the people who want to set up OctoPrint will do so
on a Raspberry Pi though, so my instructions are geared to installing
OctoPi. On the download page, you will find links to a few OctoPi mirrors,
so choose one and download the most recent OctoPi image in compressed
zip form.
</p><p>
OctoPi is based on Raspbian, so once you have the .zip file,
installation works like most other Raspberry Pi images you may have worked
with in the past. Unzip the file, insert an SD card in your computer,
and then use <tt  >dd</tt> to write the image to your SD card device:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo dd if=2015-07-02_2015-05-05-octopi-wheezy-0.12.0.img 
 &#8618;of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1M
</pre>
</p><p>
After you write the image to the SD card, check to see if it automatically
mounted the drive. If not, eject and re-insert it, and mount it. If
you plan to network the Raspberry Pi via Wi-Fi, OctoPi has added a new
mechanism as of version 0.12. Edit the octopi-network.txt file on the
root of the SD card with your wireless network settings. Save your changes
and unmount the SD card. Now you are ready to insert the SD card in your
Raspberry Pi and boot it.
</p><p>
When the Raspberry Pi boots and is on the network, you will be able to
log in to it over SSH with the same default credentials that Raspbian uses
(login &ldquo;pi&rdquo;, password &ldquo;raspberry&rdquo;), but of course, you'll want to use the
<tt  >passwd</tt>
command to change that to something else. As with Raspbian, you can type
<tt  >sudo raspi-config</tt> to change system settings, and OctoPrint recommends that
you use this tool to expand the SD card's filesystem to fill the device.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2562580.0x265ab98"></a>
Web Interface</h2></div></div><p>
Once your Raspberry Pi is on the network, you can access the OctoPrint Web
interface through http://octopi.local (if your system supports bonjour),
or otherwise, just type the host's IP address in your Web browser. You
should see an interface like the one shown in Figure 1. If you haven't yet connected
your 3D printer to the Raspberry Pi, this is a good time. On the left
side of the Web page is a Connection section that should list reasonable
default serial devices it can use to connect to your printer, so you
should be able to press the Connect button successfully. If for some
reason that doesn't work, you may have to log in to your Raspberry Pi
and check the output of <tt  >dmesg</tt> to see what sort of device your 3D printer
showed up as when you plugged it in.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11903f1.large.jpg"><img src="11903f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Default OctoPrint Interface
</p></div></div><p>
The default OctoPrint screen shows a graph of your printer's extruder
temperature and (if it has one) the heated bed temperature, and it will
allow you to set the temperature of either one manually. On the left-hand
side of that main page, you can upload GCODE files you have created on Cura
or some other slicing tool, and then you can click the printer icon to start
printing. This main page also lets you pause and cancel jobs. The pause
feature is useful if you need to swap filament in the middle of a print,
either because you ran out or because you want to blend multiple colors.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11903f2.large.jpg"><img src="11903f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. OctoPrint Control Interface
</p></div></div><p>
The second tab on OctoPrint provides a Web-based control panel that you can
use for manual control of the X, Y and Z axes of your printer as well
as extrude plastic. If OctoPrint detects a USB Webcam or the Raspberry
Pi camera, it automatically will start MJPG-streamer, and you should be
able to see live video from your Webcam (Figure 2). This is pretty useful
when you want to start a print from some other room of the house or if
you want to monitor a print in progress. If you do have a camera aimed
at your printer, you also can click on the Timelapse tab and configure
OctoPrint to create a time-lapse video of your print. It can either take
a snapshot every few seconds or it can take a shot every time the Z axis
changes (that is, when the printer moves to the next layer).
</p><p>
The GCode Viewer tab lets you view the current GCODE being sent to the
printer in a 2D representation of the print. You either can watch it
command by command, or you can use a slider on this screen to inspect
the tool path on each layer of your print. I've used this feature in
the past when I wanted to create a multi-color print of a topographic
map in order to identify the specific layer where the GCODE changed from sea
level to ground level, so I could pause it and swap blue plastic to
another color.
</p><p>
Finally, the Terminal tab is handy, as most 3D printers use GCODE commands
to tweak calibration settings. For instance, my Printrbot has a Z axis
probe it uses to level the print bed automatically in software; however,
you still need to fine-tune the Z axis via a GCODE command. The terminal
tab lets you type in those raw GCODE commands and see their output.
</p><p>
All in all, even though Cura is great for 3D printer control, I find I
typically use OctoPrint for all of my 3D printing. It's just too nice
to be able to start a long print and check up on it from the couch. Plus,
the ability to generate time-lapse videos of your prints is hard to beat.
</p><p>
As you can see, an awful lot has changed in 3D printing since my first
series of columns three years ago. Although in many cases the changes are
negative (like the shift toward proprietary software and hardware), there
still are quite a few positive changes from advances in the remaining
3D printers that have open hardware, advances in 3D printing software
and more focus on ease of use. I hope you've enjoyed this series on the
current state of 3D printing from a Linux perspective. If not, the
good news is that next month I'll move on to more traditional topics
for Hack and /.
