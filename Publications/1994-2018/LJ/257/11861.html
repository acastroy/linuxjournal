How to harden TLS and SSH.

Encryption and secure communications are critical to our life on the
Internet. Without the ability to authenticate and preserve secrecy, we
cannot engage in commerce, nor can we trust the words of our friends and
colleagues.
</p><p>
It comes as some surprise then that insufficient attention has been paid
in recent years to strong encryption, and many of our &ldquo;secure&rdquo; protocols
have been easily broken. The recent Heartbleed, POODLE, CRIME and BEAST
exploits put at risk our trust in our networks and in one another.
</p><p>
Gathered here are best-practice approaches to close known exploits and
strengthen communication security. These recommendations are by no means
the final word on the subject&mdash;the goal here is to draw focus upon
continuing best practice.
</p><p>
Please note that many governments and jurisdictions have declared
encryption illegal, and even where allowed, law enforcement has become
increasingly desperate with growing opaque content (see the Resources
section for articles on these topics). Ensure that both these
techniques and the content that they protect are not overtly illegal.
</p><p>
This article focuses on Oracle Linux versions 5, 6 and 7 and close
brethren (Red Hat, CentOS and Scientific Linux). From here forward, I 
refer to these platforms simply as V5, V6 and V7. Oracle's V7 runs only on
the x86_64 platform, so that's this article's primary focus.
</p><p>
These products rightly can be considered defective, in spite of constant
vendor patches. The library designers would likely argue that their place
is to implement mechanism, not policy, but the resulting products are
nonetheless critically flawed. Here is how to fix them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2556580.0x264e618"></a>
Strong Ciphers in TLS</h2></div></div><p>
The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols emerged from the older Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) that originated in the Netscape browser and server
software.
</p><p>
It should come as no surprise that SSL must not be used in any context for
secure communications. The last version, SSLv3, was rendered completely
insecure by the recent POODLE exploit. No version of SSL is safe for secure
communications of any kind&mdash;the design of the protocol is fatally flawed,
and no implementation of it can be secure.
</p><p>
TLS version 1.0 is also no longer safe. The immediate preference for secure
communication is the modern TLS version 1.2 protocol, which, unfortunately,
is not (yet) widely used. Despite the lack of popularity, prefer 1.2 if you
value security.
</p><p>
Yet, even with TLS version 1.2, there still are a number of important
weaknesses that must be addressed to meet current best practice as
specified in RFC 7525:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
&ldquo;Implementations MUST NOT negotiate RC4 cipher suites.&rdquo; The RC4 cipher is
enabled by default in many versions of TLS, and it must be disabled
explicitly.
This specific issue was previously addressed in RFC 7465.
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;Implementations MUST NOT negotiate cipher suites offering less than 112
bits of security, including so-called 'export-level' encryption (which
provide 40 or 56 bits of security).&rdquo; In the days of SSL, the US
government forced weak ciphers to be used in encryption products sold or
given to foreign nationals. These weak &ldquo;export&rdquo; ciphers were created to be
easily broken (with sufficient resources). They should have been removed
long ago, and they recently have been used in new exploits against TLS.
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;Implementations MUST NOT negotiate SSL version 3.&rdquo; This formalizes our
distaste for the entire SSL suite.
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;Implementations SHOULD NOT negotiate TLS version 1.0 (or)
1.1.&rdquo; Prefer
TLS 1.2 whenever possible.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
There are several implementations of the TLS protocols, and three competing
libraries are installed on Oracle Linux systems by default: OpenSSL, NSS
and GnuTLS. All of these libraries can provide Apache with TLS for HTTPS.
It has been asserted that GnuTLS is of low code quality and unsafe for
binary data, so exercise special care with this particular library in
critical applications. This article focuses only on OpenSSL, as it is
the most widely used.
</p><p>
For TLS cipher hardening under OpenSSL, I turn to Hynek Schlawack's Web site
on the subject. He lists the following options for the SSL configuration of
the Apache Web server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SSLProtocol ALL -SSLv2 -SSLv3
SSLHonorCipherOrder On
SSLCipherSuite
ECDH+AESGCM:DH+AESGCM:ECDH+AES256:DH+AES256:ECDH+
&#8618;AES128:DH+AES:ECDH+3DES:DH+3DES:RSA+AESGCM:
&#8618;RSA+AES:RSA+3DES:!aNULL:!MD5:!DSS
</pre>
</p><p>
This configuration focuses upon the Advanced Encryption Standard
(AES)&mdash;also known as the Rijndael cipher (as named by the cipher's originators),
with 3DES as a fallback for old browsers. Note that 3DES generally
is agreed to provide 80 bits of security, and it also is quite slow. These
characteristics do not meet the above criteria, but we allow the legacy
Data Encryption Standard (Triple-DES) cipher to provide continued access to
older browsers.
</p><p>
On an older V5 system (which does not implement TLS 1.1 or 1.2 in OpenSSL),
the list of acceptable ciphers is relatively short:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat /etc/oracle-release /etc/redhat-release 
Oracle Linux Server release 5.11
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.11 (Tikanga)

$ openssl ciphers -v
'ECDH+AESGCM:DH+AESGCM:ECDH+AES256:DH+AES256:ECDH+
&#8618;AES128:DH+AES:ECDH+3DES:DH+3DES:RSA+AESGCM:

DES-CBC3-SHA         SSLv3 Kx=RSA Au=RSA Enc=3DES(168) Mac=SHA1
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that TLS version 1.1 introduced new defenses against CBC
exploits. CBC is used above only with the 3DES cipher, which calls into
question the use of 3DES with TLS version 1.0. Removing 3DES and/or
enforcing a minimal protocol of TLS version 1.1 might be required if your
security concerns are very grave, but this will adversely impact
compatibility with older browsers. Banishing CBC on OpenSSL 0.9.8e will
leave you with few working ciphers indeed.
</p><p>
On V7, the list of allowed ciphers is considerably longer:

<pre     class="programlisting">

</pre>
</p><p>
If possible under your release of Apache, also issue an <tt  >SSLCompression
Off</tt> directive. Compression should not be used with TLS because of the
CRIME attack.
</p><p>
If you have connectivity problems with Web clients, try disabling the
Cipher Order directive first. Custom HTTP clients may not fully implement
the TLS negotiation, which might be solved by allowing the client to pick
the cipher.
</p><p>
The cipher selector above also prevents any exploit of the
&ldquo;Logjam&rdquo; (weak
Diffie-Hellman primes) security flaw that recently has surfaced. If your
version of Apache supports an alternate dh-prime configuration, it is
recommended that you follow this procedure:


<pre     class="programlisting">
openssl dhparam -out /home/httpd/conf/dhparams.pem 2048
</pre>
</p><p>
Then add the following line to your Apache SSL configuration:


<pre     class="programlisting">
SSLOpenSSLConfCmd DHParameters "/home/httpd/conf/dhparams.pem"
</pre>
</p><p>
Ensure that you have appropriate permissions on your dhparams.pem file, and
note that V5 does not support this configuration.
</p><p>
When you have applied these configuration changes to your Apache Web
server, use the SSLlabs.com scan tool to rate your server (see Resources). If you are on an
older V5 platform that uses the OpenSSL 0.9.8e release, the grade assigned
to your server should be a &ldquo;B&rdquo;&mdash;your final security grade will be higher
if you are on a later release.
</p><p>
It is also important to restart your TLS Web server for key regeneration
every day, as is mentioned in the Apache changelog: 
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Session ticket
creation uses a random key created during web server startup and recreated
during restarts. No other key recreation mechanism is available currently.
Therefore using session tickets without restarting the web server with an
appropriate frequency (e.g. daily) compromises perfect forward secrecy.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
This information is not well known, and has been met with some surprise and
dismay in the security community: &ldquo;You see, it turns out that generating
fresh RSA keys is a bit costly. So modern web servers don't do it for every
single connection. In fact, Apache mod_ssl by default will generate a
single export-grade RSA key when the server starts up, and will simply
re-use that key for the lifetime of that server&rdquo; (from <a href="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2015/03/attack-of-week-freak-or-factoring-nsa.html" target="_self">blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2015/03/attack-of-week-freak-or-factoring-nsa.html</a>).
</p><p>
Note that Hynek Schlawack's site provides configuration instructions for
nginx and HAProxy in addition to Apache. Several other applications allow a
custom cipher specification&mdash;two that I mention here are stunnel and
sendmail.
</p><p>
The stunnel &ldquo;TLS shim&rdquo; allows clear-text socket applications to be
wrapped in TLS encryption transparently. In your stunnel configuration,
specify the <tt  >cipher=</tt> directive with the above string to force stunnel to
best practice. Also, on the V7 platform, supply the
<tt  >fips=no</tt> directive;
otherwise, you will be locked to the TLS version 1 protocol with the message
<tt  >'sslVersion = TLSv1' is required in FIPS mode.</tt>
</p><p>
The sendmail transport agent has received recent patches to specify
ciphers fully. You can add the following options to your sendmail.cf to force
best practice ciphers:

<pre     class="programlisting">
O CipherList=ECDH+AESGCM:DH+AESGCM:ECDH+AES256:DH+
&#8618;AES256:ECDH+AES128:DH+AES:ECDH+3DES:DH+3DES:
&#8618;RSA+AESGCM:RSA+AES:RSA+3DES:!aNULL:!MD5:!DSS
O ServerSSLOptions=+SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2 +SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3
 &#8618;+SSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE
O ClientSSLOptions=+SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2 +SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3
 &#8618;+SSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE
</pre>
</p><p>
With these settings, you will see encryption information in your mail logs:

<pre     class="programlisting">
May 12 10:17:58 myhost sendmail[1234]: STARTTLS=client,
 &#8618;relay=mymail.linuxjournal.com., version=TLSv1/SSLv3, 
 &#8618;verify=FAIL, cipher=AES128-SHA, bits=128/128
May 12 10:38:28 myhost sendmail[5678]: STARTTLS=client,
 &#8618;relay=mymail.linuxjournal.com., version=TLSv1/SSLv3, 
 &#8618;verify=FAIL, cipher=AES128-SHA, bits=128/128
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >verify=FAIL</tt> indicates that your keys are not signed by a certificate
authority (which is not as important for an SMTP server). The encryption is
listed as AES128-SHA.
</p><p>
For a public mailserver, it is important to be more permissive with the
allowed ciphers to prevent SMTP sessions from going clear text. Behind a
corporate firewall, however, it is likely better to force strong TLS
ciphers more rigorously.
</p><p>
It is also important to apply vendor patches
promptly for TLS. It 
recently was discovered that later TLS versions were using SSLv3 padding
functions directly in violation of the standards, rendering the latest
versions vulnerable (this was more a concern for NSS than OpenSSL). Prompt
patching is a requirement for a secure TLS configuration.
</p><p>
I would like to thank Hynek Schlawack for his contribution to and
thoughtful commentary on TLS security.

Strong Ciphers in SSH</h2></div></div><p>
It is now well-known that (some) SSH sessions can be decrypted (potentially
in real time) by an adversary with sufficient resources. SSH best practice
has changed in the years since the protocols were developed, and what was
reasonably secure in the past is now entirely unsafe.
</p><p>
The first concern for an SSH administrator is to disable protocol 1 as it
is thoroughly broken. Despite a stream of vendor updates, older Linux
releases maintain this flawed configuration, requiring the system manager
to remove it by hand. Do so by ensuring &ldquo;Protocol 2&rdquo; appears in your
sshd_config, and all reference to &ldquo;Protocol 2,1&rdquo; is deleted. Encouragement
also is offered to remove it from client SSH applications as well, in case a
server is inaccessible or otherwise overlooked.
</p><p>
For further hardening of Protocol 2 ciphers, I turn to the Stribika SSH
Guide. These specifications are for the very latest versions of SSH and
directly apply only to Oracle Linux 7.1.
</p><p>
For older versions of SSH, I turn to the Stribika Legacy SSH Guide, which
contains relevant configuration details for Oracle Linux 5, 6 and 7.
</p><p>
There are only two recommended sshd_config changes for Oracle Linux 5:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Ciphers aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr
MACs hmac-ripemd160
</pre>
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the PuTTY suite of SSH client programs for Win32 are
incompatible with the <tt  >MACs hmac-ripemd160</tt> setting and will not connect
to a V5 server when this configuration is implemented. As PuTTY quietly
has become a corporate standard, this likely is an insurmountable
incompatibility, so most enterprise deployments will implement only the
Cipher directive.
</p><p>
Version 0.58 of PuTTY also does not implement the strong AES-CTR ciphers
(these appear to have been introduced in the 0.60 release) and likewise
will not connect to an SSH server where they are used exclusively. It is
strongly recommended that you implement the Cipher directive, as it removes
RC4 (arcfour), which is totally inappropriate for modern SSH. It is not
unreasonable to expect corporate clients to run the latest versions of
PuTTY, as new releases are trivially easy to install.
</p><p>
Oracle Linux 5 has a role of special importance as it is the underlying OS
for the Linux version of the Oracle Exadata architecture (the alternate OS
being Solaris). If you are an Exadata customer, confirm with Oracle that
you will retain vendor support if you change cipher and protocol settings
on a supported Exadata appliance.
</p><p>
V5's default SSH ciphers will be pruned especially hard:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ man sshd_config | col -b | awk "/Ciphers/,/ClientAlive/"

Ciphers

Specifies the ciphers allowed for protocol version 2.  
Multiple ciphers must be comma-separated. The 
supported ciphers are 3des-cbc, aes128-cbc, aes192-cbc, 
aes256-cbc, aes128-ctr, aes192-ctr, aes256-ctr, arcfour128,
arcfour256, arcfour, blowfish-cbc, and cast128-cbc. The
default is

    aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,arcfour256,arcfour128,
    aes128-cbc,3des-cbc,blowfish-cbc,cast128-cbc,aes192-cbc,
    aes256-cbc,arcfour
</pre>
</p><p>
It is possible to install a newer version of OpenSSH on V5, but it is not
easy. Attempting to compile the latest release results in the following
error:

<pre     class="programlisting">
error: OpenSSL &gt;= 0.9.8f required (have "0090802f 
 &#8618;(OpenSSL 0.9.8e-fips-rhel5 01 Jul 2008)")
</pre>
</p><p>
It is possible to compile OpenSSH without OpenSSL dependencies with the
following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
--without-openssl Disable use of OpenSSL; use only 
 &#8618;limited internal crypto **EXPERIMENTAL**
</pre>

Enterprise deployments are likely unwilling to use experimental code, so I
won't go into further details. If you obtain binary RPMs for upgrade,
ensure that you know how they were produced.

Oracle Linux 7 lacks a few ciphers from the latest releases of SSH and
differs only slightly from the recommended settings:


<pre     class="programlisting">
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
Ciphers aes256-gcm@openssh.com,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,
&#8618;aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr
KexAlgorithms diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256
MACs hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-
&#8618;etm@openssh.com,hmac-ripemd160-etm@openssh.com,
&#8618;umac-128-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256,
&#8618;hmac-ripemd160,umac-128@openssh.com
</pre>
</p><p>
Oracle Linux 7.1 can be configured exactly as recommended, including the
new ed25519 hostkey:

<pre     class="programlisting">
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key

</pre>
</p><p>
The Stribika Guide immediately dismisses the 3DES cipher, which is likely
reasonable as it is slow and relatively weak, but also goes to some length
to criticize the influence of NIST and the NSA. In the long view, this is
not entirely fair, as the US government's influence over the field of
cryptography has been largely productive. To quote cryptographer Bruce
Schneier, &ldquo;It took the academic community two decades to figure out that
the NSA 'tweaks' actually improved the security of DES....DES did more to
galvanize the field of cryptanalysis than anything else.&rdquo; Despite
unfortunate recent events, modern secure communication has much to owe to
the Data Encryption Standard and those who were involved in its
introduction.
</p><p>
Stribika levels specific criticism:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
...advising against the use of NIST
elliptic curves because they are notoriously hard to implement correctly.
So much so, that I wonder if it's intentional. Any simple implementation
will seem to work but leak secrets through side channels. Disabling them
doesn't seem to cause a problem; clients either have Curve25519 too, or
they have good enough DH support. And ECDSA (or regular DSA for that
matter) is just not a good algorithm, no matter what curve you use.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
In any case, there is technical justification for leaving 3DES in TLS, but
removing it from SSH&mdash;there is a greater financial cost when browsers and
customers cannot reach you than when your administrators are inconvenienced
by a software standards upgrade.
</p><p>
If you are using ssh-agent with a private key, you can strengthen the
encryption of the password on the key using this method documented by
Martin Kleppmann with PKCS#8. Here is the procedure summarized from the
author:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd ~/.ssh

mv ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa.old

openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -v2 des3 -in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.old 
 &#8618;-out ~/.ssh/id_rsa

chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
</pre>
</p><p>
The author estimates that this procedure provides the equivalent benefit of
adding two extra characters to the password. It is important to note,
however, that the PuTTY agent is not able to read the new format produced
here. If you use pagent with PuTTY (or expect to), convert your OpenSSH key
to pagent first, then run this procedure, assuming that retention of your
key in both formats is allowed. It is likely wise to retain a copy of the
original private key on offline media. It is also important to note that
this procedure does not add any extra protection from a keylogger.
</p><p>
User SSH keypairs are likely superior to passwords for many aspects of
security. SSH servers cannot enforce password standards on remote keys
(minimum password length, change frequency, reuse prevention and so on), and
there are definite risks in forwarding the ssh-agent that would compromise
server security. If you allow your users to authenticate with SSH keypairs
that they generate, you should understand how they can be (ab)used.
</p><p>
Finally, be aware that keystroke delay duration can be used as a side
channel exploit in SSH via the application of the Viterbi
Algorithm.
Interactive SSH sessions are more revealing of content than most expect
and should be avoided for those with high security requirements. Send
batches of <tt  >ssh</tt> commands, or implement a bandwidth
&ldquo;fuzzer&rdquo; in a secondary
session on the same channel if an interactive session is required but
security is critical. Of particular note:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The &ldquo;superuser&rdquo; command (that is, <tt  >su -</tt>) creates a distinct traffic signature
in the encrypted data stream that reveals the exact length of the target
password, plus keystroke timing. It should not be used over an SSH session.
</p></li><li><p>
If a user logs in to a remote SSH host, then uses the remote to log in to yet
another host in a three-host configuration, this creates an even more
distinct traffic signature in the encrypted data stream that essentially
advertises the exact length of any passwords used. Avoid this practice.
</p></li><li><p>
Depending upon the cipher used, a short password (less than seven characters)
can be detected at login. Enforce a minimum password length larger than
seven
characters, especially for SSH sessions.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I would like to thank Stribika for his contribution to and thoughtful
commentary on SSH security.

Unbreakable Encryption</h2></div></div><p>
While the best practices above are helpful, these protocols have been
entirely inadequate in assuring private communication channels, and they
have been broken many times.
</p><p>
If your needs for secure communication are so dire that any risk of
interception is too great, you likely should consider encryption tools
that do not appear to have been broken as of yet.
</p><p>
A careful parse of recent evidence indicates that the Gnu Privacy Guard
implementation of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) continues to present
insurmountable difficulty to eavesdropping and unauthorized decryption.
</p><p>
This utility is installed in all recent versions of Oracle Linux by
default. It should be your first thought for secure communications, and you
should realize that all the techniques described above are compromises for
the sake of expedience.
