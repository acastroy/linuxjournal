Size of Print</h4><p>
I was going to praise your magazine with printing code that I could read
in the article on containers. (Okay, I am a little behind in my reading.)
But, then I go to At the Forge, and I have code in a font so small that
even when I enlarge it, it's too small. Please help an old man's eyes.

Trying to fit code into a readable, not word-wrapped format that is flexible
between devices is surprisingly difficult. It's a challenge every month for our
layout person. Although I'm sure there will be some articles that are frustrating with
particularly long lines of code, we'll keep trying to make it all
readable&mdash;or as
readable as possible!&mdash;Shawn Powers

OpenSSL vs. Libre SSL</h4><p>
Considering the vulnerabilities that have become known
recently in OpenSSL, please publish an article on OpenSSL
vs. LibreSSL, and when LibreSSL may be ready for prime
time. I did find this article that is about a year old:

General Relativity in Python</h4><p>
I just wanted to thank Joey Bernard for the great introduction to
SymPy [see Joey's article in the July 2015 Upfront section]. It always give me a kick to read (and sometimes replicate) on my
cobbled-together Linux box what once was the demesne of secret government
research facilities. As more and more emphasis in placed on reproducible
research rather than on splashy headlines, these types of articles will
be invaluable.

<span   class="bold"><b>Joey Bernard replies:</b></span> It is always great to hear from people who get some
use from the
articles I write. In my day job, I am constantly pushing on
researchers the importance of reproducible research, so consider me a
kindred spirit.

Find and Xargs</h4><p>
Here's a follow-up comment regarding Gary Artim's letter and Shawn Powers'
reply in the July 2015 issue.
</p><p>
Although <tt  >find</tt>'s <tt  >exec</tt> option can be handy, I would respectfully disagree
that it's &ldquo;probably even more efficient&rdquo; than
<tt  >xargs</tt>. As I understand it,
the user-supplied command is invoked once for every file that matches
<tt  >find</tt>'s criteria.
</p><p>
Each command invocation involves overhead: program initialization,
option processing, cleanup and so on.
</p><p>
For commands that support multiple files (such as
<tt  >rm</tt>, <tt  >tar</tt>,
<tt  >zip</tt>, <tt  >grep</tt> and so on),
the <tt  >xargs</tt> approach is better. The filenames are
collected into a list,
and the user-supplied command is invoked a minimal number of times. The
overhead is minimized.
</p><p>
For small numbers of matching files, the <tt  >exec</tt> option won't cause any
noticeable delay. But, if the user-supplied command is non-trivial, or
if there are large numbers of matching files, the
<tt  >xargs</tt> approach can avoid
a lot of wasted processing time.
</p><p>
As a followup article, I would suggest discussing how to use a
<tt  >find</tt>-<tt  >xargs</tt>
pipeline to execute commands where the file list is not the last item on
the command line (for example, copying or moving a set of files to a destination
directory). The <tt  >xargs</tt> command is supposed to support this, but in my
experience, it's quite fragile. Maybe I'm missing something.

Hmm, I'll have to look into this and see if I can make an interesting article out of it.

System Status as SMS Text Message</h4><p>
Regarding Dave Taylor's article &ldquo;When Is a Script Not a Script&rdquo; in the
May 2015 issue: here's just an alternate way to text message, not requiring mail
setup, using curl:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/bash
while [ 1 ]
do
        pingout=$(ping -c 1 textbelt.com)
        STATUS=$?
        if [ "$STATUS" -eq "0" ]; then
                break
        else
                sleep 5
        fi
done
ipaddress="$(/usr/bin/hostname -i)"
/usr/bin/curl http://textbelt.com/text 
 &#8618;-d number=9999999999 -d "message=$ipaddress"  &gt;
/var/log/rc.local.log 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
exit 0
</pre>
</p><p>

July 2015 <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span></h4><p>
As always, it's a pleasure to read and so much to learn. The only typo I
spotted in the July 2015 issue was on page 38 with Dave Taylor's
&ldquo;Working with Functions: Tower of Hanoi&rdquo;,
as I am sure everyone will mention. The solution is (2**n)-1 and not
(2**n)+1 as printed.

July 2015 Work the Shell</h4><p>
In the July 2015 issue, Dave Taylor writes, &ldquo;The biggest limitation with shell functions is that
they can return an integer value only of 0&ndash;127, where a typical script
actually utilizes the 0 = false or failure, 1 = true or success&rdquo;, and
the above is even repeated as a big banner across the top of the page 37.
</p><p>
These claims are quite easy to verify. Let's try the following shell
script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
check () {
    return $1
}

for x in 254 255 256 257 258 ; do
    check $x ; echo $?
done
if check 0 ; then echo "A" ; fi
if check 1 ; then echo "B" ; fi
</pre>
</p><p>
If you take the quoted statement at face value, you will likely be
quite surprised by results of running this script with the help of a few
different shells (say bash, dash, zsh, ksh) accepting the syntax. What
you will see may be somewhat different in places but not in a material way.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Michal Jaegermann  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span> Thanks for writing
in, Michal. Of course, a function
can return a numeric value in the shell, and that value can be interpreted
as the calling script desires. My point was more that function return
values are constrained by the simple integer range&mdash;whether it's
0&ndash;127 or 0&ndash;65536&mdash;and so I generally just ignore return values from
functions entirely and use global variables instead. If we were in any more
sophisticated programming language, of course, functions could return any
number of complex data types and sidestep the limitation.

Thanks for the Docker Articles</h4><p>
Thanks very much for the Docker articles in the June 2015 issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>!
They were quite a helpful primer. [See Shawn Powers' &ldquo;Doing Stuff
with Docker&rdquo; and Federico Kereki's &ldquo;Concerning Containers'
Connections: on Docker Networking&rdquo;.]

Erik   <br><br>
</p><p>
You're very welcome! I'm a big fan of breaking down complicated or scary
topics into the basics. It's mainly because I know that awkward, embarrassed feeling of 
being in a conversation with others about a new technology (such as Docker)
and not having any clue what they're talking about. Information wants to
be free! (Okay, I'll get off my soapbox. Thanks again for the kind
words.)&mdash;Shawn Powers

Shared Libraries and Kernel Mode</h4><p>
In the July issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, Zack Brown's &ldquo;diff
-u&rdquo; article discusses the efforts to extract part of the
kernel code into libraries. He likens this to the debate about micro versus
monolithic kernels. I thought that the current debate was about making
libraries that could be used elsewhere (and/or substituted) but still
running in kernel space. I understand that Linus Torvalds is enthusiastic
to push stuff to user space, but I don't believe that was directly related
to the current discussion of the &ldquo;library-ification&rdquo; of kernel
code.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Ray Foulkes  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Zack Brown replies:</b></span> Thanks for the letter!
You're right that current efforts to librarify the kernel don't make it
more of a microkernel and are not part of that debate.
</p><p>
But, I wanted to link the two, because I feel they attempt to achieve
similar things. In a microkernel, as you say, the user can swap out chunks
of the system that inhabit user space, replacing them with new or
experimental implementations.
</p><p>
The library-ification effort is similar; although in the case of libraries,
the control is given at compile time rather than at runtime. The user may
replace one subsystem with another in a relatively orderly way, using a
known library interface.
</p><p>
It's this orderliness that for me has a similar feel to a microkernel
approach. Both cases rely on clear interfaces that provide the ability to
replace whole subsystems, without requiring a deep rewrite of adjoining
kernel code.
</p><p>
So I don't mean to say that the library-ification effort is part of an actual
switch to a microkernel design. But&mdash;and now giving vent to pure
speculation&mdash;I do think that library-ification could someday make it easier
for Linux to support &ldquo;hotswapping&rdquo; arbitrary subsystems in a running
kernel (at which point Linux truly might start to resemble a microkernel in
practice).
