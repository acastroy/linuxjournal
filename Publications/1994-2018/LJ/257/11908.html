An interview with Phil Windley on how to build an IoT that isn't a forest
of silos&mdash;which is all we have so far.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a04580.0x2afc300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Before the Internet there were just nets, and they didn't get along. Each
was a country or a city-state of its own, with hard boundaries that could
not be crossed&mdash;or could be crossed only if the owners of the networks
created closed and silo'd ways of doing it. Every company's LAN (Local Area
Network), for example, had its own way of working, with its own internal
e-mail system and methods for transferring files. The same went for
&ldquo;on-line services&rdquo;, such as AOL and Compuserve. Those too were closed
and separate worlds of their own. You couldn't send e-mails from one to the
other. Many vendors of network &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; considered lack of
interoperability a feature and not a bug.
</p><p>
The Internet didn't blow existing networks away so much as it simply
subordinated them to higher principles that were good for everybody and
everything: 1) making every node an end point and 2) getting all the
member networks to agree about how to pass data from any end to any other
end. Those agreements are protocols, which are simply manners, like nods or
handshakes.
</p><p>
That all networks agreed on the same protocols for moving data between end
points, with no guards or tolls at border crossings, was as unlikely as
instant world peace. Yet, that's exactly what it was&mdash;and still is.
True, there are countries that censor or restrict the Net and companies
that charge us for access to it, but the Net itself is as open and
ownerless as gravity and light.
</p><p>
The main effect of the Net in our midst is elimination of distance. This is
new to human experience, but it's already as ordinary, embedded and essential to
civilization and its future as were language, fire and the wheel when each
of those came along&mdash;and just as easy to take for granted. So easy, in
fact, that we've forgotten why the Net was such a big success in the first
place.
</p><p>
This amnesia is made clear by pretty much everything happening in the
ill-named &ldquo;Internet of Things&rdquo; (aka IoT) today. Rather than a true
Internet of Things&mdash;namely, the Internet we already have&mdash;we have
what Phil Windley calls &ldquo;The Compuserve of Things&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2014/04/the_compuserve_of_things.shtml" target="_self">www.windley.com/archives/2014/04/the_compuserve_of_things.shtml</a>). In other words,
silos of things. In his summary of that essay, Phil writes:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
On the Net
today we face a choice between freedom and captivity, independence and
dependence. How we build the Internet of Things has far-reaching
consequences for the humans who will use&mdash;or be used by&mdash;it. Will we
push forward, connecting things using forests of silos that are reminiscent
of the on-line services of the 1980s, or will we learn the lessons of the
Internet and build a true Internet of Things?
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Right now the way to bet is on the forest of silos. Every gizmo- and
system-maker either has its own silo for things or one inside a farm run by
Google, Apple, Facebook or some other large operator. For a clear and
depressing look at how this is already ending up badly, read Bruce
Sterling's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Epic Struggle of the Internet of Things</em></span> or Cory Doctorow's
summary of it
(<a href="http://boingboing.net/2014/09/13/bruce-sterlings-the-epic-s.html" target="_self">boingboing.net/2014/09/13/bruce-sterlings-the-epic-s.html</a>).
</p><p>
For a clear and encouraging look at where this should be going, read Phil
Windley (<a href="http://www.windley.com" target="_self">www.windley.com</a>). He not only writes eloquently about the
IoT (<a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/iot.shtml" target="_self">www.windley.com/tags/iot.shtml</a>), but he has been working
on GPL'd open-source code for things and how they relate
(<a href="https://github.com/kre/Kinetic-Rules-Engine" target="_self">https://github.com/kre/Kinetic-Rules-Engine</a>). To me, Phil is the
Linus of IoT&mdash;or will be if people jump in and help out with the
code.
Whether Phil fills that role or not, nobody has more useful or insightful
things to say about IoT. That's why I decided to interview him here.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span> To me, your most important insight is that <span   class="emphasis"><em>things don't need onboard
intelligence to be on the Net</em></span>. Every thing can have what you
call a pico&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>a persistent compute object</em></span>
(<a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2015/05/picos_persistent_compute_objects.shtml" target="_self">www.windley.com/archives/2015/05/picos_persistent_compute_objects.shtml</a>). Earlier you called these
&ldquo;clouds&rdquo; of their own. What led you to make this leap, which to my
knowledge, nobody else has done?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>PW:</b></span> We've made a mistake associating the Internet of Things too closely
with &ldquo;things&rdquo;. To be functional, the IoT will have to operate on a model of
the world that doesn't just connect things, but people, places,
organizations and even concepts. Everything will have to be on-line. I've
been heavily influenced on this by David Gelernter's book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mirror
Worlds</em></span>
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_Worlds" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_Worlds</a>).
Even though it was written in 1993, pre-Web, it still reads well.
</p><p>
For example, I like to think about what it would take to put every pothole
on the Internet of Things. Why? Imagine driving onto your street and seeing
a new pothole. Your heads-up display could alert you to its presence, maybe
even automatically help your car avoid it. You'd see infographics that tell
you when it appeared, who reported it to the city, that city inspectors
looked at it last Thursday, and when they were planning to fix it. A city
engineer might see a history of potholes on your street, how they related
to other infrastructure like water and sewer lines, and so on. The road
crew that comes to fix it would see something else entirely.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span> Interesting. So, if I understand it right,
somebody&mdash;anybody&mdash;could create the first pico for a pothole.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>PW:</b></span> Right. It could be a driver, a resident, a person on a truck from the
city, somebody on a crew doing electrical work....
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span> But once the pico is created, and has an OS and storage cloud of its
own, it can retain information and interact with different parties. Is that
right?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>PW:</b></span> Right.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span> How will it work so the city engineer, the driver and the road crew see
something different in a pothole's pico?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>PW:</b></span> Picos have relationships with other picos or services. The pico can
present a different API based on the nature of the relationship. So in the
case of the pothole, its pico would naturally have a relationship with the
street it's part of. The homeowner and city engineer would also have a
relationship with the street. The street would introduce the pothole to
them, and they'd create a direct relationship. This can all happen
automatically and on the fly. The attributes of those relationships would
control what the driver's or engineer's pico saw when they queried the
pothole.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span> Meanwhile <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> the conversation and development on IoT is on things with
built-in intelligence or data storage. What made you start thinking and
working outside that box?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>PW:</b></span> Well, the world is full of things, and only some of them have
intelligence. Worse, most of the intelligence being built into things is
silo'd to Apple or Google/Nest or some other company&mdash;what I call the
Compuserve of Things. All this thinking and development is as primitive and
isolated and broken and doomed as Compuserve was. Don't get me wrong, it's
all useful up to a point, just like Compuserve was. But we didn't iterate
from Compuserve to the Internet, and we won't iterate from the current work
on IoT to what we really need to build.
</p><p>
To be fully useful and meaningful, IoT should embrace all things, whether
or not they have intelligence or memory onboard. Among the infinitude of
things in the world are potholes.
</p><p>
Of course, potholes aren't computers, so you can't program them. And we're
unlikely, at least for a while, to instrument them. But we could put them
on the Internet of Things, as a functional entity with a pico, or something
like it. The pico represents the pothole in models, manages relationships
to other picos, remembers attributes, history and past interactions, and
runs programs for the pothole. The pothole has an API, responds to queries,
listens for events and participates as a full-fledged member of the IoT.
</p><p>
When you start to think of the IoT this way, you realize that there could
be trillions of things, and many of them won't need a microprocessor to be
part of it.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span> You also have a kind of operating system for picos called CloudOS, and
a language for programming them called KRL. How did those come about?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>PW:</b></span> KRL started off as a domain-specific language for Web page
augmentation, and it got away from me. As KRL become more capable, with
support for an entity-oriented event bus, event expressions and persistent
variables, picos more or less sprung into existence. It was very much a
process of discovery.
</p><p>
CloudOS came about one day when Ed Orcutt and I realized that KRL was
finally powerful enough to build the functionality we needed for a new
project instead of having to put it in the underlying pico hosting platform
(KRE). This was a great feeling because it told us we were getting close to
having a mature system that could be used for real IoT products.
</p><p>
I have a group of students working on rewriting CloudOS to incorporate the
lessons we've learned over the last four years, most notably from using it,
and picos, to build the Fuse-connected car system (<a href="http://joinfuse.com" target="_self">joinfuse.com</a>).
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span> Companies also can give anything they make or sell its own pico,
along with its serial number, SKU (stock-keeping unit) or VIN (vehicle
identification number). I can imagine lots of ways this can play out, but
I'd rather hear where your thinking goes with it.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>PW:</b></span> As cheap as microprocessors are, it's still going to be a while before
there's one in everything we buy. In many cases, the business model just
can't support it yet. But picos are cheap and easy to create. So it's
feasible to give one to every thing right now.
</p><p>
This lets manufacturers, retailers and almost anyone add unique
functionality to products that haven't had it before. One obvious,
easy-to-imagine scenario is for the product, backed with a pico, to serve
as the customer service portal for the owner. The product pico has a
relationship with the owner and one with the manufacturer. When there's a
problem, the product itself can intermediate the customer support.
</p><p>
But customer support is just a start. Why doesn't my furnace order its own
filters, send a text to my teenage son to install them, and then augment
his allowance when he's done? Why doesn't my car schedule its own oil
changes?
</p><p>
We've always imagined a future world where the device itself is finally
smart enough to take care of itself. But we don't need to wait for a smart
furnace in our home. With a cloud-based doppelganger in the form of a pico,
the furnace could do it today.
</p><p>
The best part is that the architecture puts all of this firmly in the
control of the owner, not some cloud owned by the manufacturer. Picos use a
hosting model not unlike how Web pages work, so it's easy to move them from
the manufacturer's hosting site to your own with no loss of functionality.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span> How do you see this playing out in the marketplace?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>PW:</b></span> Socially, so to speak. In a blog post
on social things, I describe how
social things get along with other social things
(<a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2015/07/social_things_trustworthy_spaces_and_the_internet_of_things.shtml" target="_self">www.windley.com/archives/2015/07/social_things_trustworthy_spaces_and_the_internet_of_things.shtml</a>). And, just as important,
how they can protect themselves from things that don't play well in the
sandbox.
</p><p>
Imagine a world where things are connected, but unsociable. Every
interaction would have to be explicitly scripted or it wouldn't happen. Oh
wait, you don't have to imagine it. That's the current model for the IoT, and
it won't scale.
</p><p>
On the other hand, if the things we buy are social, not just able to
connect to their maker, but also have relationships with other things,
people, places and concepts, they can play a variety of roles. As a small
example of this, suppose I buy an electric car. The car needs to negotiate
charging times with the air conditioner, the home entertainment system and
so on. The charging time might change every day. How does the car find
these other devices? How does it know which of them to trust? How do they
know if they can trust the car? What happens if I want to charge my car at
my friend's house?
</p><p>
The number of interaction scenarios for connected devices grows
exponentially. We can't script that. It has to come into being on its
own.
A collection of manufacturer-provided APIs doesn't cut it. Social things
act as independent agents to accomplish goals on behalf of their owner.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span> So, while they might be social things, they're still
<span   class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span> things. They
work for you&mdash;not for somebody else.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>PW:</b></span> Right. They know their place in the world, so to speak. That's an
important component of sociality.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span> The IoT, whatever it turns out to be, comes at an interesting time for
Linux, because Linux's main problem today is its success. In its first
decade, Linux was a cause. In its second decade, it won. Now it's
everywhere. I'd like to see the same thing happen with the IoT, based on
somebody's code&mdash;yours, or anybody's. What can we do to energize
development around the early code we already have, and what additional code
bases are we going to need?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>PW:</b></span> One big problem is that there are a thousand and one IoT projects.
Everyone&mdash;and I'm as guilty as anyone else&mdash;just wants to work on
their own, so none of us get critical mass. Commercial efforts get
traction, but aren't likely to produce the true IoT we all want to live
with. You've pointed out that the Internet doesn't have a business model.
Neither will the IoT.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span> And we're a long way from it.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>PW:</b></span> Yes. But, we can see the way forward if IoT has a cause. As you say,
Linux was a cause&mdash;and still is. Here's mine: <span   class="emphasis"><em>we won't get a true
Internet of Things until we connect things together in ways that are
decentralized, heterarchical and interoperable</em></span>. These are key properties
of the Internet, and they're sadly lacking in almost every so-called IoT
product on the market.
</p><p>
Furthermore, we need an IoT architecture that is biased toward personal
control of things without any intervening administrative authority (like
the manufacturer, the police, or the Federal Highway Administration, to
name a few). What if, in some future world, a root certificate authority
revokes the identity documents I use for banking, shopping, travel and a
host of other things? Or if my car stops running because Ford shuts off my
account? Personal control of the connected things in our lives is
fundamental for our freedom.
</p><p>
As a result, I believe the architectural and business model choices we make
around IoT will have far-reaching consequences for the humans who will
use&mdash;or be used by&mdash;it. I write about social things and build
connected car systems like Fuse because I'm hoping to convince people, a
few at a time, that there's an alternative to the Compuserve of
Things&mdash;one
that actually supports freedom.
</p><p>
We can push forward at building forests of silos that are reminiscent the
disconnected on-line services of the 1980s, or we can learn the lessons of
the Internet and build a true Internet of Things. That's our choice. And I
think it's a cause worth working on.
