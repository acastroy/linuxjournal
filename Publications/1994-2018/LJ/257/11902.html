I'm a space nerd. That's probably not a surprise, but just how deep my
nerdery goes might be. I have just about every space photo NASA has ever
released. I schedule NASA.tv mission briefings on my Google Calendar as
if they were specifically for me. I used to make my kids watch Shuttle
launches on our TV, even if they were doing homework! (They didn't mind
that so much.) Heck, growing up, I wanted to be an astronaut, but since
I've worn Coke-bottle thick glasses since I was four years old, I realized
I'd never be able to go to space. In fact, I'm a writer today because
if I couldn't actually go to space, I wanted to write fiction about space.
</p><p>
I'm not a science fiction writer, although I hope someday that might
change. (As a side note, if you haven't read <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Martian</em></span> by Andy
Weir, you should do so right now. It's possibly my favorite book of
all time!) I am, however, still an avid space fan. Thankfully, being a
Linux user doesn't hinder me from using technology in order to augment my
stargazing. In fact, Linux has an incredible set of tools available for
the space nerd, and with the New Horizons probe recently passing Pluto,
there's an increase in the number of people looking up at night. So first,
I'm going to talk about how Linux can help you appreciate the
heavens&mdash;then I plan to yammer on about Pluto for a bit. Don't worry, I'll warn
you before this article jumps the shark!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b0580.0x29a85c0"></a>
The Software</h2></div></div><p>
There are four main astronomy packages for the Linux user. Only one of
them is Linux-specific, but all work well with every distribution I've
tried. There is a lot of overlap between the four programs, but each has
its own unique twist as well.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Google Sky:</b></span>
</p><p>
I want to love Google Sky&mdash;really. The idea of searching for objects
in space using Google is really appealing. Unfortunately, it just never
seems to work for me very well. It's perfectly possible that I've never
seen how amazing it can be, but since other options exist
that are Linux-native, I'm not willing to put too much effort into it.
</p><p>
My experience has been that Google Sky appears to have lots of graphical
data, including Hubble imagery. Unfortunately, it lets you zoom
in to only a few celestial objects, and in my experience, none of the planets,
save Earth. I've had similar luck with Linux using Firefox and Chrome,
and I even tried with OS X to similar result. If you're a Google fan and
want to search the cosmos like you search for a local pizza joint, perhaps
you'll have better luck than me. Check it out at <a href="http://sky.google.com" target="_self">sky.google.com</a>.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Kstars:</b></span>
</p><p>
Kstars is the Linux-specific program. And quite honestly,
that's not entirely true. Although historically Kstars (part of the KDE
suite) has been a Linux application, it does in fact run on multiple
platforms. I'd be surprised if it runs as well on Windows as it does on
Linux, but it seems only fair to mention the possibility.
</p><p>
And, although I'd like to say the Linux-specific application is my favorite,
it's just not true. Kstars does have a boatload of data and more than half
a million objects in its database, but the interface is more like a
dynamic star map than a stargazing experience itself. That's not a bad
thing, and if you're looking for research information or want to see
exactly what the sky looks like from your yard, Kstars is great. To
re-use my pizza metaphor from earlier though, Kstars is like my least favorite
pizza. It's still pizza, and pizza is delicious!
</p><p>
Kstars is available in most distribution's software repositories. It's
as easy as an <tt  >apt-get</tt> or <tt  >yum</tt> away, and there's no reason not to give it
a try. The initial setup wizard will ask you for your specific location
(Figure 1), and unless you live in a big city, it likely won't be able
to find you. In order to get an accurate view of your night sky, you'll
need to know your precise latitude and longitude coordinates. (Google
should be able to help you find that information.)
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11902f1.large.jpg"><img src="11902f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Kstars is a powerful program with loads of data and the
ability to import even more.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Celestia:</b></span>
</p><p>
My favorite feature of Celestia (a GTK program) is the ability to
&ldquo;fly&rdquo;
to other planets (Figure 2). Perhaps it's my lingering dreams of
being an astronaut, but there's something about flying through the cosmos
to a distant planet or galaxy that really appeals to me. Celestia also
does time shifting, which allows you to see what the stars and planets
will look like, or did look like, on any given day. Although it's not exactly
powerful enough to predict a collision with a Near Earth Asteroid,
it does make planning for a future evening of stargazing much more
fun. Traveling to a Dark Skies park with a Dobsonian light bucket only
to discover Saturn has dipped below the horizon can make for a horrible
evening. Time shifting is incredibly useful. You can get Celestia for
your Linux (or other) computer in the software repository or at
<a href="http://www.shatters.net/celestia" target="_self">www.shatters.net/celestia</a>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11902f2.large.jpg"><img src="11902f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. A still photo can't do the &ldquo;flying&rdquo; feature justice.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Stellarium:</b></span>
</p><p>
I won't try to hide it, Stellarium is my favorite piece of astronomy
software. Celestia wins the wow factor with its &ldquo;cruise through
space&rdquo; feature, but Stellarium wins for me in every other
way&mdash;except when
it comes to quitting the program. Honestly, I couldn't figure it out
for a long time. There's no quit button from what I can tell, and I just
couldn't figure out how to exit the program (which starts in full-screen
mode, making quitting even more challenging). Let me save you some time:
Ctrl-Q. You're welcome.
</p><p>
Some of my favorite features include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Graphical Horizon: not only does Stellarium give you the view of the sky from your latitude
and longitude coordinates, but it also shows you what to expect on the
horizon. This includes what it might look like with trees, buildings and so
on
(Figure 3). Although it's a generic trees/buildings skyline,
it does help approximate what you can expect to see. If Jupiter is
just over the horizon, you might not see it if there are houses in the
way. It's not perfect, but it's a great visualization tool. That said,
I think it would be amazing to integrate a feed from Google Street View
to see what the actual skyline might look like, but I'm sure there
are practical reasons that hasn't been implemented.
</p></li><li><p>
Night Mode:
the other programs I mention in this article might have a night mode, but I've
never seen the option. With Stellarium, a simple click into night mode
will change all the graphics to a red color. If you're a stargazer, you
probably know that red lights don't ruin night vision like other colors
of light. That means you can take your laptop out with you and use it in
the field to identify objects without ruining your adjusted night vision.
</p></li><li><p>
Interplanetary Visitation:
okay, I made that term up, but as a wannabe science fiction writer, it's a
pretty significant feature. Have you ever wondered what the stars look
like from Mars? With Stellarium, you can adjust your point of reference
and see the universe from other places <span   class="emphasis"><em>in</em></span> the
universe. I can't wait for
the data to be updated enough to stand on Pluto and look at Charon with
high-resolution images from New Horizons.
</p></li><li><p>
Time Shifting: this isn't unique to Stellarium, but it's a feature I really like. Not
only can you travel to a different time in the past or future, but you
actually can &ldquo;fast-forward&rdquo; time to see the changes that will occur in
a pseudo-video of events. This helps young kids see the stars move when
in real life they appear to be static. (Okay, the stars aren't actually
moving around, it's us that is moving, but that's part of the discussion
to have with your kids. More learning!)
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11902f3.large.jpg"><img src="11902f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The horizon feature is incredible and helps identify where
you're looking.
</p></div></div><p>
Stellarium is available in most distributions, or you can head over
to <a href="http://stellarium.org" target="_self">stellarium.org</a> and download the version for your operating
system. Some nights, especially in the winter, I like to play with
Stellarium and stare at the night sky from the confines of my cozy
house. A large monitor and a dark room can make Stellarium almost as
good as the real thing. Almost.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b0580.0x29a9900"></a>
Mobile Magic</h2></div></div><p>
As much as I like computer software for finding and planning stargazing
sessions, they're honestly not my go-to way to technologize the
cosmos. For that, I tend to whip out my cell phone and point it at the
sky. No, I don't try to call E.T.; rather I employ apps like Star Walk
(my favorite) to use &ldquo;augmented reality&rdquo;, which is the coolest thing
since telescopes.
</p><p>
With Star Walk (or Sky Map, or Star Chart), you simply hold your phone
toward the sky, and using GPS coordinates, motion sensors and digital
compass, the app shows you an overlay of what you're pointing at. Want to
know what that super-bright star is on the horizon? (It's probably Venus.) Just
point your phone at it, and you'll see a nice clear label. Not sure if you're
seeing a cluster of stars in the distance or just a smudge on your
binoculars? Pinch out to zoom in and look (Figure 4). Truly, smartphones have changed the way nerds like me share excitement about stars
and such with others. I've personally never seen Pluto in a telescope,
but I've pointed my phone at the sky knowing I'm looking in the right
direction. It's a little like having a GPS device for stargazing. It's
incredibly awesome.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11902f4.large.jpg"><img src="11902f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Smartphones have changed the way we stargaze.
</p></div></div><p>
You can find Star Walk and the other Android apps I mentioned in the
Google Play store. I could give you URLs, but really, I've come to the
conclusion that it's easier just to search by name. Star Walk isn't free,
but it's only a few dollars and well worth the price of admission. And
with that, I must warn you, I'm going to talk about our formerly-a-planet
friend, Pluto.

Shawn's Excitement, and Soapbox</h2></div></div><p>
Almost exactly in time for my 40th birthday (literally, three days
before), the New Horizons probe zoomed past Pluto and its moons at more
than
50,000km/hr. There was no way for it to slow down, but the flyby was the
goal of the mission, and it succeeded! In a matter of a week, we learned
more about Pluto than we've ever known in the history of mankind&mdash;and
that information wasn't what we were expecting at all.
</p><p>
Pluto is so small and cold, we expected to see an ancient, cratered,
frozen rock. Instead, we discovered a geologically active world with young
mountain ranges and atmospheric attributes never imagined possible.
Although
most of the world looked at the charming heart-shaped area on the photo
(Figure 5), scientists were wondering where the craters were and
how on earth mountains formed. See, a lack of craters means the surface
is changing and reforming, covering up impact craters. And the mountains
mean there has been some sort of geological action like we see on Earth.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11902f5.large.jpg"><img src="11902f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. I &lt;3 you too, Pluto!
</p></div></div><p>
We have no idea why&mdash;and that's awesome. Jupiter's moon Io is geologically
active, but we understand why. With Jupiter's gravity squeezing it,
Io has no choice but to spew lava out of volcanoes. If you've ever bent
a metal coat hanger back and forth, you know firsthand how friction
can cause heat. Jupiter's squeezing literally causes enough friction
on Io to make it geologically active. Our own planet has an active,
molten core that causes our geologic activity.
</p><p>
Pluto shouldn't have either. Charon isn't large enough to squeeze Pluto,
and the dwarf planet is so small it should have cooled off long ago. So
why is Pluto geologically active? We don't know! Yay for science!
</p><p>
I won't get too high on my soapbox about how sad I am over the budget
slashing our space program has received during the past 50 years. Space
exploration is a passion of mine, and until it's a passion for the rest
of the world, its budgetary importance will remain low. Although I won't
urge you one way or another politically, I will urge you to introduce
your spouses, kids, nephews, nieces and grandkids to the cosmos. You
can use Linux to make it technological and relevant, and with smartphones,
you even can make it relevant to teenagers!
</p><p>
And really, you should read that Andy Weir book. It's incredible!
