    xfm converted this file manager skeptic. After reading this
    review, you too may be swayed.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26e9580.0x27e1450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Using a file manager is a matter of
personal taste. Some of the hard core Unix users prefer to type
their Unix commands (probably not even using a GUI), while others
click away at a file manager, which takes over some of the mundane
file operations. As one of those people in the first category, I
had avoided the use of a file manager until I saw the utility and
the flexibility of xfm, which is one of the file managers supplied
with the Slackware distribution of Linux (but you probably haven't
configured it yet).
</p><p>Not only does xfm provide the usual services of a file
manager&mdash;allowing the insertion, deletion, copying and movement of
files and directories, but, in addition, its Applications window
allows you to start programs by clicking their icons &agrave; la
Windows.</p><p><a href="1074f1.jpg" target="_self">Figure 1</a> shows a sample File
Manager window, with some of its many pixmap icons (that make it
look a lot better than Xfilemanager, the other manager that comes
with Slackware). The two yellow folder icons denote directories.
The directory folder on the upper left with the arrow heads can be
double clicked to go up a directory. The other directory folder
(nextdir) shows there is one directory below the present one.
Double clicking on it opens that directory. The other icons are for
different types of files (there are about 35 different file icons
to distinguish between files ending in such things as ps, gz, tar,
gif, etc). Double clicking a regular file&mdash;the one in white&mdash;brings
it up in your editor, while other actions are associated with the
other file types: double-clicking a PostScript (PS) file brings it
up in ghostview, and clicking a gif file displays it. Pushing the
right mouse button on an file icon brings up a menu of edit, move,
delete, information, and permissions, each or which then causes a
dialog box to open for (or with) more information. These menu
options are all self-explanatory.</p><p>The three the buttons, <b  >File</b>, <b  >Folder</b>, and <b  >View</b>, at the top of
the File Manager window have drag down menus. For the File button
there are numerous options, including select all and delete, a
combination that would empty a directory. Under Folder are the
options make a new directory or go directly to a new directory, so
that you don't have to click through the entire directory tree to
go from top to bottom, chasing folder icons. Home is a convenient
option as well. View changes the file display in the File
Manager&mdash;files can be listed by name (much like an ls -l listing)
rather than with icons. A portion of the directory tree can be
shown instead or you may elect to show the hidden files.</p><p>To move files between directories, it is convenient to open
several File Manager windows&mdash;one for each directory you are
using&mdash;by clicking the right button on a folder&mdash;this time we get
a new menu allowing open, move, delete, information, and
permissions, so we chose open. Or we can drag a directory folder
out of the File Manager onto the root window and release. The
moving process is simply done by selecting a file with the left
mouse button and then dragging the file from one directory window
to the other. To copy files, you do the same using the middle mouse
button. (Note: files must be copied, not moved, between different
file systems, otherwise you get a cross-device error.)</p><p>The Applications Manager that comes along with the File
Manager window can be configured with the applications that you use
frequently&mdash;and it's not just one windowfull, you change to
different configurations by using the toolkit approach. More about
this later.</p><p>Some of the icons in my Applications window (see
<a href="1074f2.jpg" target="_self">Figure 2</a>) do the following: Double
clicking the Xterm icon brings up a color_xterm with a scroll bar
and tcsh, while dragging an executable program from the File
Manager window and dropping it on the Xterm icon executes that
program. Every icon can have two actions&mdash;one for double clicking,
one for drag and drop. Dropping files onto the trash can moves them
to a directory called .trash for later disposal. Dropping
PostScript files on the PSPrinter icon prints them out.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26e9580.0x27e1920"></a>Setup</h2></div></div><p>Type <b  >xfm.install</b> (a program included with
xfm) will add the directories .xfm and .trash in your root
directory and place several configuration files in .xfm. You may
then modify these files to optimize the program for yourself. These
configuration files include xfmrc, a file that associates file
types to icons and actions, and xfm-apps that lists the
applications and icons that appear in the Application Manager and
the associated double click and drag and drop actions. xfmdev is a
listing of devices (disk drives/CD) and the mount and umount
commands (see &ldquo;Linux Tips&rdquo;, <i  >Linux Journal</i>,
April 1995 page 41). Finally there is a file for each of the
additional &ldquo;tool boxes&rdquo; that you wish to add.
</p><p>The man page that comes with xfm is very well written and
explicit on its use. Be sure to read it before doing any
changes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26e9580.0x27e1b30"></a>Configuring the File Manager</h2></div></div><p>Many of the double-click/drag&mdash;drop operations are
pre-configured in xfmrc based on the following format:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
file_name:icon:push-action:drop-action
</pre><p>Xfm recognizes file names three ways: by the file name itself
(e.g., core or Makefile), by its extension (<b  >*.c</b>
means c source files), or by its prefix
(<b  >README*</b>). The most common pattern used for the
<b  >file_name</b> is <b  >*.suffix</b>, which,
to have it recognize C files, is *.c, with the * permitting any
file name ending in .c to be recognized. The
<b  >push-action</b> (activated by double clicking the
icon) is what you most likely will change in the xfmrc file. For
example, I changed the <b  >push-action</b> on
<b  >*.gif</b> files to xv rather than xpaint. I also
added:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
*.au:xfm_au.xpm:cat $* &gt;/dev/audio:
*.dat:xfm_data.xpm::
</pre><p>The first plays au files (audio files) when they are double
clicked (read the Sound HOWTO, if you haven't configured sound),
while the second merely associates the xfm_data icon to data files
that I have created for executable programs.
</p><p>Drop actions are those that occur when a file is dragged onto
the icon. I don't have any drop actions defined for my File Manager
window.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26e9580.0x27e2058"></a>Configuring the Applications Manager</h2></div></div><p>The programs and icons that constitute the Applications
manager are dictated by the xfm-apps file. The entries in that file
have a somewhat different form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
name:directory:filename:icon:push-action:drop-action
</pre><p><b  >name</b> is the title that appears in the
Applications window, <b  >icon</b> is the name of the
icon to use, <b  >push-action</b> is what to do when the
icon is double-clicked, and <b  >drop</b> is what happens
when a file is dropped on the icon. A simple example is</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PSPrinter:::printer.xpm::exec lpr $*
</pre><p>Double clicking this printer icon does nothing, while dropping a
PostScript file on it from the file manager window results in the
file being printed. The remaining entries in this file look like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Xterm:::xterm.xpm:exec color_xterm -sl 600 -sb -fn
*     7x14 -j -ls -e tcsh:$*
Xclipboard:::clipboard.xbm:exec xclipboard:
Scilab:::math4.xpm:exec scilab:
Graphics::.xfm/xfm-graphics:xfm_appmgr.xpm:LOAD:
System::.xfm/xfm-system:xfm_apps.xpm:LOAD:
Calendar:::calendar.xpm:exec xcalendar:
CD:/cdrom::cdrom.xpm:OPEN: (*This line should not be broken)
</pre><p>Toolbox, Graphics and System are icons that change the Applications
window to another containing a different set of application icons.
For example, I made a simple graphics tool box with the following
entry in xfm-apps:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Graphics::.xfm/xfm-graphics:xfm_apps.xpm:LOAD:
</pre><p>The LOAD command loads the .xfm/xfm-graphics file below:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Apps::.xfm/xfm-apps:xfm_apps.xpm:LOAD:
XFig:::draw.xpm:exec xfig: exec xfig -P -e ps -startf 16 $*
XPaint:::xpaint.xpm:exec xpaint:exec xpaint $*
XV:::xv.xpm:exec xv:exec xv $*
mpeg:::movie.xpm::exec mpeg_play -loop $*
</pre><p>The Apps line gets me back to the previous window: xfm-apps.</p><p>In the other applications file, System, I have in
.xfm/system</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Apps::.xfm/xfm-apps:xfm_apps.xpm:LOAD:
Xsysinfo::::xsysinfo:
TOP::::exec xterm -e top:
who:::view.xpm:exec who|xless:
lpq::::exec lpq |xless:
</pre><p>By piping the last two commands to xless, an xwindow is
created that displays the results of the Unix commands.
</p><p>Dialog boxes allow the input of command line parameters, such
as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
LaTeX::::(latex %Latex_file\:%;beep):(latex $*;beep)
grep:::grep.xpm::grep '%Regular expression\:%' $*
</pre><p>The percent signs delimit the comment for the dialog box
(with the <b  >\</b> escaping the <b  >:</b>).
The beep is to tell me when the operation is done; it is defined as
<b  >echo -n '^G'</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26e9580.0x27e2948"></a>Changing the Defaults</h2></div></div><p>If you prefer a different default editor than emacs, then you
need to add an entry to the .Xdefaults file in your root directory.
The xfm man page lists resources that you can change. I changed two
by adding <b  >Xfm*defaultEditor: textedit</b> and
<b  >Xfm*updateInterval: 3000</b>. (Be sure to run xrdb
.Xdefaults to get the changes implemented if you want them before
you next start X.) The update interval change was to refresh the
directories more often than the default 10000 milliseconds. You can
also change the default directory paths to the pixmap files; this
may be important if your pixmaps are not in the default location
(add <b  >Xfm*pixmapPath:
<i><tt>your_path</tt></i></b> Alternatively, to
make changes for all users, root can change options in the Xfm file
in /usr/X386/lib/X11/app-defaults.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26e9580.0x27e2bb0"></a>About Xfm</h2></div></div><p>Xfm was created by Simon Marlow, who maintained it up to
version 1.2. Albert Graef produced the present versions, fixing
some bugs and adding the pixmaps. (He also graciously reviewed this
article, improving it). As you read this, version 1.3.2 should be
available, with such features as the recognition of &ldquo;magic&rdquo; file
types in addition to those now specified in xfmrc, and better
management of applications groups, such as installing applications
groups within the applications manager, cut/copy/paste between
applications files, and a view option for the File Manager (in
addition to edit).</p><p><a href="1074s1.html" target="_self">Getting xfm-1.3</a></p></div></div>
