    &ldquo;Computer Supported Cooperative Work&rdquo; (CSCW) and &ldquo;groupware&rdquo;
    both refer to software that supports group projects. This
    article demonstrates how to build a small CSCW application
    using the free LINCKS CSCW.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1295580.0x138d298"></a></h2></div></div><p>In <i  >Linux Journal</i> Issue 11, we described a
typical installation of LINCKS, described the functionality of its
components, and briefly introduced the main application interface,
xlincks. Since LINCKS is distributed with an online tutorial, and a
70-page xlincks manual, we will assume that you know the basics
about operating xlincks. In this second and last part, we describe
how to create your own views, or general presentation descriptors
(GPD), as we call them. For a reference manual description of GPDs,
see chapter 7 of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>xlincks User's Manual</em></span>,
and for a technical overview description see <span   class="emphasis"><em>Journal of
Systems and Software</em></span>.
</p><p>As a running example, we will show you how to use xlincks to
create an address book, and the GPDs used to enter and display
data. We start out by designing our data structures, then describe
the LINCKS object model, and finally show how the address book is
represented in the object model. We briefly describe the automatic
search for GPDs used in xlincks and show our first GPD, followed by
a description of the GPD's parts. We conclude by extending the
newly-created GPDs to demonstrate a few additional features.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1295580.0x138d500"></a>An Address Book</h2></div></div><p>In our address book, the two obvious objects are the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>person object</em></span> containing personal information,
such as: name, birth date, e-mail address, and private phone
number, and the <span   class="emphasis"><em>address object</em></span>. An address
object can be shared by different persons and contains the common
street address and common phone number.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1295580.0x138d6b8"></a>The LINCKS Object Model</h2></div></div><p>In LINCKS, each object consists of the following parts:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >IMAGE</b> storing any type of
information which can be PostScript, object code, a GIF, or a name
(string). The size must be less than 232-1 bytes and the content is
single-valued. (Currently, xlincks can only handle IMAGEs
containing zero-terminated strings.)</p></li><li><p><b  >ATTRIBUTE</b> describing or typing
the object. The value of an attribute is a zero-terminated string
shorter than 216-1 bytes. An attribute is named by two strings, a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>group</em></span> tag and a <span   class="emphasis"><em>field</em></span>
tag, where several attributes can share the same group tag, but the
combination of group and field must be unique.</p></li><li><p><b  >LINKS</b> containing links to other
objects. A link field is <span   class="emphasis"><em>plural</em></span>, that is, for
each object it can contain several links to other objects, as
opposed to the attributes, which are single-valued.</p></li></ul></div><p>In <a href="1072f1.jpg" target="_self">Figure 1</a>, the window with
three entries is the person object where the image contains the
person's name, the second line specifies the birth date, and the
fourth line is a link to an address object. The second, bigger
window is the <span   class="emphasis"><em>node</em></span> view applied to the same
object. (To apply another view, click on the item, then on the
&ldquo;Expand...&rdquo; menu item, and then choose the node view. See the
previous article in Issue 11, or read the xlincks manual, for more
information.) The first entry in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>node</em></span> view
is the image, followed by all the attributes and finally the link
section beginning with the <b  >SYSTEM:Parent</b>
entry.</p><p>Notice that the system creates the two attributes
<b  >SYSTEM:Created</b> and
<b  >SYSTEM:Owner</b>--this pair is a good example of two
attributes sharing the same group tag. In general we use all
capital letters for the group part and lower case letters, possibly
initial capital letters, for the field part.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1295580.0x138def8"></a>Person GPD</h2></div></div><p>GPDs are named by a string, which may contain white space.
xlincks looks for a specific GPD first in your own
<b  >GPDmap</b>s and then in the list of system
<b  >GPDmap</b>s. This allows you to override the system
GPDs with your own specialized GPDs. Now, if you expand the
<b  >Empty User 4's GPDmap</b> line, you will get a
window with your first GPDmap as in <a href="1072f2.jpg" target="_self">Figure
2</a>.
</p><p>Replace the &lt;&lt;<b  >table</b>&gt;&gt; with the
name of the new GPD, <b  >person</b> and then move out of
the line with ctrl-n. A new placeholder
&lt;&lt;<b  >gpd</b>&gt;&gt; will appear which we fill in
with a one line description of the new GPD, <b  >view of person
object</b>, as in <a href="1072f3.jpg" target="_self">Figure 3</a>.
Now, expand (meta-l meta-e) the description line to get the empty
GPD template seen in the bottom of Figure 3.</p><p>First, you add a link from the GPDmap by first clicking on
the line <b  >Empty User 4's GPDmap</b> followed by a
click on the line &lt;&lt;<b  >gpdmap</b>&gt;&gt; in the
empty GPD, then on the <b  >Add Link</b>
button&mdash;resulting in &lt;&lt;<b  >gdpmap</b>&gt;&gt;
being replaced with a link to <b  >Empty User 4's
GPDmap</b>.</p><p>Second, we need to define the logical structure by describing
the logical parts in the person object. Earlier, we defined the
person object to contain a <b  >name</b> and
<b  >birth date</b>. Now, move to
&lt;&lt;<b  >direct</b>&gt;&gt; line in the
<b  >STRUCTURE</b> section and replace it with the name
of our GPD, <b  >person</b>. The name of the GPD used in
GPDmap <span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> occur at least once in the
STRUCTURE part. After moving out of the line, we replace the newly
created <b  >empty: value</b> with the parts in our
person object: <b  >name</b> and &ldquo;<b  >birth
date</b>&rdquo;--since the part name includes a space we must use
quotation marks (otherwise it would be three parts!).</p><p>Third, now that we've defined the structure of the person
object, we need to define <span   class="emphasis"><em>where</em></span> to store the
information. The <b  >ACCESS</b> section of the GPD
defines where we store or retrieve the parts of the logical
structure. We would like to store the person's name in the
<b  >IMAGE</b> part and his/her birth date in an
<b  >ATTRIBUTE</b> called
<b  >ADDRESSBOOK:Date</b>.</p><p>To specify the name component, we move to the
&lt;&lt;<b  >direct</b>&gt;&gt; in the
<b  >ACCESS</b> section and replace it with the
<b  >name</b> (the name of structure part). Then we move
out of the line and replace the <b  >empty: value</b>
with <b  >IMAGE</b>. The resulting GPD can be seen in
<a href="1072f4.jpg" target="_self">Figure 4</a>. A warning: any omitted
ACCESS specification defaults to <b  >IMAGE</b>!</p><p>To define where we find the &ldquo;<b  >birth date</b>&rdquo;
in the <b  >ACCESS</b> part we move the cursor to the
<b  >name</b> line in the <b  >ACCESS</b>
section and do an insert closest plural (<span   class="emphasis"><em>meta-l
meta-i</em></span>), with the result as shown in
<a href="1072f5.jpg" target="_self">Figure 5</a>. Replacing the
<b  >direct</b> line with <b  >birth date</b>
(without quotation marks!) and the <b  >empty: value</b>
line with <b  >ATTR ADDRESSBOOK Date</b> gives us
<a href="1072f6.jpg" target="_self">Figure 6</a>. Notice that we use the
keyword <b  >ATTR</b> followed by the group tag
(ADDRESSBOOK) and the field tag to define the storage place for
<b  >birth date</b> in an attribute.</p><p>Last, if we would like to try our new GPD, we need to create
a place to store the object, say in our LINCKS home
directory:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>1) Click on the line &ldquo;Linux on the Road&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>2) Do an insert closest plural (meta-l
meta-i)</p></li><li><p>3) Expand the item (using meta-l meta-e or
ctrl-left-click)</p></li><li><p>4) Fill in the GPD as person</p></li><li><p>5) Expand the same line (person) which should
result in a two-line window saying item and empty: birth date as
seen in <a href="1072f7.jpg" target="_self">Figure 7</a>.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1295580.0x1385f98"></a>Address GPD</h2></div></div><p>We will not cover the creation of the address GPD in that
much detail, but the basic steps are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>1) Select the GPDmap (use the same that we used for
the person GPD)</p></li><li><p>2) Move to the person line. and do an insert
plural.</p></li><li><p>3) Name the GPD address and give it the descriptive
line view of address object.</p></li><li><p>4) Expand on the view of address object.</p></li><li><p>5) And complete it according to
<a href="1072f8.jpg" target="_self">Figure 8</a>.</p></li></ul></div><p>Now, we need to create an address object and we follow the same
steps as for the initial person object. We add the object to our
home directory with the result as in <a href="1072f9.jpg" target="_self">Figure
9</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1295580.0x1386570"></a>Connecting the Address GPD &amp; the Person
GPD</h2></div></div><p>We have now defined templates for storing and retrieving
address and person objects, but we need to connect one person to
one or more specific addresses. We would like to link one person
object to one or more address objects under the link name of
<b  >ADDRESSBOOK Address</b> (group and field tag). We
will modify the person object to include a link to an address
object. First, we need to add a new entity to the logical
structure. Let us call it <b  >address</b>. Second, we
need to specify where to find the new part, extending the person
GPD as in <a href="1072f10.jpg" target="_self">Figure 10</a>.
</p><p>Notice that we have introduced the <b  >ATTR
CONSTANT</b> which defines a constant attribute, in this case
a sequence of dashes. Moreover, in the GPD's
<b  >EXPAND</b> section we have defined that any
expansion of the logical part <b  >address</b> (which is
found by following the link <b  >ADDRESSBOOK:Address</b>)
should be viewed using the address GPD. After storing the changed
person GPD, we expand again the <b  >Martin
Sj&ouml;lin</b> entry in our home directory and we see the
added dashes as well as the placeholder
&lt;&lt;<b  >address</b>&gt;&gt;
(<a href="1072f11.jpg" target="_self">Figure 11</a>).</p><p>Adding a link to address <b  >+46 13 148155</b> to
the placeholder and after expanding that phone number, we get
<a href="1072f12.jpg" target="_self">Figure 12</a>.</p><p>To make the person GPD look more like the standard folder or
our home directory, we can put a border around the address entry
(for example, the phone number) and push the left margin 10 pixels
to the right by adding an entry to the <b  >FORMAT</b>
section under the logical part address as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
address
   borderWidth=1;leftMargin=10;width=400
</pre><p>where we use <b  >width</b> to specify the widget's
width in pixels.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1295580.0x1386d00"></a>Combining the person GPD and address GPD</h2></div></div><p>The last example shows how to create a combined person and
address GPD, let us call it the <b  >person and
address</b> GPD. As before, select the GPDmap, add a new GPD,
name it <b  >person and address</b> with a one line
description, as seen in <a href="1072f13.jpg" target="_self">Figure 13</a>.
This GPD contains several noteworthy features. First, we use the
font specification in the <b  >FORMAT</b> section. Any
valid X11 font in our system can be specified after the equal sign.
Sometimes quotation marks (&ldquo;) are needed around the font name.
Also, the font and marginal specification is valid for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> entries which follow below (in logical
structure), as seen in Figure 13. We have applied the
<b  >person and address</b> view on the person object
<b  >Martin Sj&ouml;lin</b> in the home directory.
</p><p>Second, in the <b  >ACCESS</b> section,
<b  >--- Indirect References ---</b> we have re-used the
ACCESS specification in the <b  >person</b> GPD by using
the same logical name on the same logical part in the
<b  >address</b> GPD and then adding a link to the
<b  >person</b> GPD. The system follows the link to the
other GPD and looks for the ACCESS specification under the name
name and <b  >birth date</b>. Thus, we only have the
ACCESS specification in one GPD instead of copied into several GPDs
(we avoid magic numbers!).</p><p>Third, what about the <b  >addresslink</b>
structure part? We have defined addresslink to point to the
<b  >address object</b> in the ACCESS section which
results in an address object. Then, in the STRUCTURE section, we
have used the indirect feature and re-used the
<b  >address</b> GPD (as seen by the descriptive name on
the line below <b  >address</b>).</p><p>Now, if we use the <b  >--- Indirect References
---</b> in ACCESS, EXPAND, or FORMAT sections, we are
<span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> re-using the declaration for that
specific logical part, that is, we are using that ACCESS, EXPAND or
FORMAT declaration in the other GPD. But, when using the
indirection in the STRUCTURE part, we use the STRUCTURE, ACCESS,
EXPAND and FORMAT declarations in the GPD that is pointed to (in
this case the <b  >address</b> GPD) and no longer use any
declarations in the GPD that is pointed from (the <b  >person
and address</b>).</p><p>For example, if we add a FORMAT specification for the
<b  >address</b> part in the <b  >person and
address</b> GPD, it will not be used since any FORMAT
declaration must be included in the (<b  >address</b>)
GPD pointed to&mdash;try it out yourself. The mechanism is similar to a
function call.</p><p>This introduction, along with the material in the xlincks
manual, should help get you started. If not, you will have to bug
the author enough to finish the real GPD tutorial, hopefully before
the next public release of LINCKS (hopefully released by the time
you read this).</p><p><a href="1072s1.html" target="_self">LINCKS RESOURCES</a></p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Martin Sj&ouml;lin is about to complete an MSc in
