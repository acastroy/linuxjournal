    The Linux File System Standard, abbreviated FSSTND, is
    important to more than gurus. In this artile, Garrett
    explains how it has worked behind the scenes to make life
    easier for all Linux users.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2783580.0x287b3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Many of us in the Linux community have
come to take for granted the existence of great books on Linux like
those being produced by the Linux Documentation Project. We are
used to having various packages taken from different Linux FTP
sites and distribution CD-ROMs integrate together smoothly. We have
come to accept that we all know where critical files like
<span   class="bold"><b>mount</b></span> can be found on
<span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> machine running Linux. We also take for
granted CD-ROM-based distributions that can be run directly from
the CD, with only a small amount of physical hard disk or a RAM
disk for some variable files like /etc/passwd, etc.
</p><p>This has not always been the case. Many of us remember Linux
from the days of the SLS, TAMU, and MCC Interim distributions of
Linux. In those days, each distributor had his own favorite scheme
for locating files in the directory hierarchy. (Actually, some can
go back further, back to the days when the boot and root disks were
the only means of getting Linux installed on your hard drive, but I
have not been a member of the Linux community quite that long.)
Unfortunately, this caused many problems when dealing with
different distributions.</p><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux File System Structure</em></span> is a
document created by a mailing list collaboration of contributors
who wish to help end anarchy. Often the group, or the document
itself, is referred to as the &ldquo;FSSTND&rdquo;. This is short for &ldquo;file
system standard&rdquo;, and was the name of the original linux-activists
mailing list channel. (The mailing list has since been moved to a
different location.) Together, these people have put together a
document which has helped to standardize the layout of file systems
on Linux systems everywhere. Since the original release of the
standard, most distributors have adopted it in whole or in part,
much to the benefit of their users.</p><p>Since the first draft of the standard, the FSSTND project has
been coordinated by Daniel Quinlan,
<a href="mailto:Daniel.Quinlan@linux.org">Daniel.Quinlan@linux.org</a>,
but the development of the standard is nearly as open as Linux
itself. The number of people who contributed to the development of
the document is quite large, since it was really developed by
consensus. Some of the most significant contributors are listed in
the FSSTND document itself.</p><p>There are a number of specific goals that the FSSTND group
set out to accomplish. The first goal was to solve a number of
problems that existed with the current Linux distributions at the
time. Back then, it was not possible to have a sharable /usr
partition, there was no clear distinction between /bin and
/usr/bin, it was not possible to set up a diskless workstation, and
there was just general confusion about what files went where. The
second goal was to ensure the continuation of some reasonable
compatibility with the de-facto standards already in use in Linux
and other UNIX-like operating systems. Finally, the standard had to
gain widespread approval by the developers, distributors, and users
within the Linux community. Without such support, the standard
would be pointless, becoming just another way of laying out the
file system. Fortunately, the FSSTND has succeeded rather admirably
in achieving its original goals.</p><p>There are also some goals that the Linux FSSTND project did
<span   class="bold"><b>not</b></span> set out to achieve. The FSSTND
does not try to emulate the scheme of any specific commercial UNIX
operating system (e.g. SunOS, AIX, BSD, etc.) Furthermore, for many
of the files covered by the FSSTND, the standard does not dictate
whether the files should be present, merely
<span   class="bold"><b>where</b></span> the files should be&mdash;if they
are present. Finally, for most files, the FSSTND does not attempt
to dictate the format of the contents of the files. (There are some
specific exceptions when several different packages may need to
know the file formats to work together properly&mdash;for example, lock
files that contain the process ID of the process holding the lock.)
The overall goal was to establish the location where common files
could be found, if they exist on a machine.</p><p>The notion of having a standard that defines the location of
certain files within a file system predates the FSSTND quite a bit.
AT&amp;T's SVID defined the location of some files, as well as a
lot of other things that most of us didn't really understand. POSIX
provided a clearer standard for a very limited number of files. The
genuine FSSTND discussion began in early August 1993. Since then,
despite some pessimism from some in the Linux community, the FSSTND
has been enormously successful, releasing three public revisions of
the document since September 1993. The latest, v1.2, was released
on March 28, 1995.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2783580.0x287b920"></a>Why do I care?</h2></div></div><p>Now if you're like me, you ask &ldquo;What does this do for me?&rdquo;
Well, the answer depends upon just who &ldquo;me&rdquo; is. The FSSTND has an
impact upon Linux users, system administrators, distributors,
documenters, and developers.
</p><p>If you are a Linux user, and you don't administrate your own
Linux system (granted, this situation is somewhat rare) then the
Linux FSSTND ensures that you will be able to find programs where
you'd expect them to be if you've already had experience on another
Linux machine. It also ensures that any documentation you may have
makes sense. (From my own experience, nothing is more annoying than
having inaccurate documentation!) Furthermore, if you've already
had some experience with Unix before, then the FSSTND shouldn't be
too different from what you're used to using, with some
exceptions.</p><p>Perhaps the most important thing is that the development of a
standard brings Linux to a level of maturity authors and commercial
applications developers feel they can support that. The recent
explosion of Linux-related books is proof of this. Before the
FSSTND, it would have been difficult to write books about Linux,
since each system was different. The FSSTND is solving all
that.</p><p>If you administer your own machine, you gain all the benefits
of the FSSTND mentioned above. You may also feel more secure in the
ability of others to provide support for you, should you have a
problem. Furthermore, periodic upgrades to your system are easier.
Since there is an agreed-upon standard for the locations of files,
package maintainers can provide instructions for upgrading that
will not leave extra, older files lying around your system
collecting disk space.</p><p>The FSSTND also means that there is more support from those
providing source code packages for you to compile and install
yourself. The provider knows, for example, where the executable for
<span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span> is to be found on a Linux
machine and can use that in his installation scripts or Makefiles.
For instance, I've written a package that does just this to
generate man pages with correct file references in them before it
installs them. If you run a large network, the FSSTND may ease many
of your NFS headaches, since it specifically addresses the problems
which formerly made shared implementations of /usr
impractical.</p><p>If you are a distributor, then you will be affected most by
the Linux FSSTND. You may have to work a little extra to make sure
that your distribution is FSSTND-compliant, but your users (and
hence your business) will gain by it. If your system is compliant,
third party add-on packages (and possibly your own) will integrate
smoothly with your system.</p><p>Your users will, of course, gain all the benefits listed
above, and many of your support headaches will be eased. You will
benefit from all the discussion and thought that has been put into
the FSSTND and avoid many of the pitfalls involved in designing a
filesystem structure yourself. If you adhere to the FSSTND, you
will also be able to take advantage of various features that the
FSSTND was designed around. For example, FSSTND makes &ldquo;live&rdquo;
CD-ROMs containing everything except some of the files in the / and
/var directories possible.</p><p>If you write documentation for Linux, the FSSTND makes it
much easier to do so, which makes sense to the Linux community. You
no longer need to worry about the specific location of lock files
on one distribution versus another, nor are you forced to write
documentation that is only useful to the users of a specific
distribution. The FSSTND is at least partly responsible for the
recent explosion of Linux books being published.</p><p>If you are a developer, the existence of a FSSTND greatly
eases many of your headaches. You can know where important system
binaries are found, so you can use them from inside your programs
or your shell scripts. Supporting users is also greatly eased,
since you don't have to worry about things like the location of
these binaries when resolving support issues. If you are the
developer of a program that needs to integrate with the rest of the
system, the FSSTND ensures that you can be certain of the steps to
meet this end.</p><p>For example, applications such as
<span   class="bold"><b>kermit</b></span>, which access the serial
ports, need to know they can achieve exclusive access to the tty
device. The FSSTND specifies a common method of doing this so that
all compliant applications can work together. That way you can
concentrate on making more great software for Linux instead of
worrying about how to detect and deal with the differences in
flavors of Linux.</p><p>As I've already indicated, the widespread acceptance of the
FSSTND by the Linux community has been crucial to the success of
both the standard and operating system. Fortunately, nearly every
distribution of Linux has been constructed to conform to the the
Linux FSSTND. The odds are, if you're running Linux, you are
running a FSSTND implementation. If your implementation isn't at
least partially FSSTND-compliant, then it is probably either
<span   class="emphasis"><em>very old</em></span> or you built it yourself. The FSSTND
itself contains a list of some of the distributions that aim to
conform to the FSSTND. Be aware, however, that some of these
distributions are known to cut some corners in their implementation
of FSSTND.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2783580.0x287bea0"></a>What's next?</h2></div></div><p>There are, of course, still unresolved issues which the
FSSTND group is still going to have to face. One of the upcoming
ones is going the be the organization of architecture-independent
scripts and data files (/usr/share). Up until now, Linux has only
been widely available on i386 and compatible machines, so the need
for standardization of such files was non-existent. The rapid
progress being made by the ports to other architectures (MC680x0,
Alpha, MIPS, PowerPC) suggests that this issue will soon need to be
dealt with. Another issue that is under some discussion is the
creation of an /opt directory as in SVR4. The goal for such a
directory would be to provide a location for large commercial or
third party packages to install themselves without worrying about
the requirements made by FSSTND for the other directory
hierarchies.
</p><p>By now your appetite should be whetted and you may want to
read the actual FSSTND document yourself. Information about how to
participate in the continuing development of the FSSTND is
contained in the FSSTND itself. The participants would appreciate
it if you carefully read the complete document
<span   class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> you join in. That way you'll be better
prepared to contribute in a valuable way to the development of the
standard.</p><p>The FSSTND provides the Linux community with an excellent
reference document and has proven to be an important factor in the
maturation of Linux. As Linux continues to evolve, so will the
FSSTND. We are grateful to Linus Torvalds, H. J. Lu, the Free
Software Foundation, and many others who have helped make Linux
<span   class="emphasis"><em>available</em></span>. The FSSTND team has helped to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>standardize</em></span> Linux, making it useful to a wider
audience.</p><p>I would like to thank Daniel Quinlan for his many valuable
corrections and suggestions for improvement to this article.</p><p>You can obtain the FSSTD document via FTP from
