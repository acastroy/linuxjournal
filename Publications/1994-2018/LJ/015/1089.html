    Would you like to take advantage of all the graphic features
    of the X Window System, but the complexities of hardware
    configuration leave you scratching your head? Greg explains
    how to get the best performance from your monitor without
    making it go up in smoke.

XFree86, the free windowing system built on top of X11R6. The
current version, 3.1.1, runs on just about any hardware, so that
there is very little reason why you shouldn't be running it.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Are</em></span> you running XFree86? That's a
different question. If you answer no, then this article may be for
you.</p><p>Another great thing about Linux is that it runs on PCs, which
have arguably the highest performance/price ratio of any computer
family. (Yes, I know, people argue this point constantly.)</p><p>Unfortunately, there are hardly two PCs with the same
hardware configuration; in the course of the PC's evolution,
hundreds of different display boards have appeared, each with their
own peculiar quirks. How come they can sell? Most people use DOS or
a system derived from DOS, and the boards have the necessary driver
software for DOS on the board. If you're running a real operating
system, you don't want to use these drivers: they run in 16 bit
mode, and they're slow. That's why XFree86 supplies its own drivers
and incorporates them in the X server.</p><p>XFree86 drivers are a &ldquo;good news, bad news&rdquo; situation. First
the bad news: setup can be more difficult. With Microsoft Windows,
you install the board and the software that comes with it, and it
works (well, you get a recognizable picture on the screen). With
XFree86, things might not be as easy.</p><p>The good news is that the drivers are much faster and much
more flexible. In particular, you can configure XFree86 to your
exact combination of display board and monitor, if you know how,
even though you need to tune it manually.</p><p>This may sound simple, or it may sound complex&mdash;and it is.
Some people set up X in a few minutes, but others run into problems
which make grown-ups cry. In this article, we'll look at:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>How display boards and monitors work.</p></li><li><p>How to set up XFree86 to work with your
hardware.</p></li><li><p>How to tune your hardware for maximum display

that you can't damage hardware with a programming mistake, but in
this case, you can, and people do from time to time. When you've
read the section on how monitors work, you'll understand, but
please don't start tuning until you understand the dangers
involved.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c8580.0x27c0ad8"></a>How TVs and Monitors Work</h2></div></div><p>You don't have to be a computer expert to see the similarity
between monitors and TVs; current monitor technology is derived
from TV technology, and many display boards have modes which can
use TVs instead of monitors. Those of us who were on the
microcomputer scene 15 to 20 years ago will remember the joy of
getting a computer display on a portable TV, a &ldquo;glass tty&rdquo; running
at 300 or 1200 bps.
</p><p>TVs and monitors display the picture by scanning lines across
the screen. As in a book, the first line starts at the top left of
the screen and goes to the top right. Each successive line starts
slightly below the previous line. This continues until the screen
is full. The lines don't have to be full; the picture is formed by
altering the intensity of the electron beam as it scans the
lines.</p><p>To perform this scan, the TV has two <span   class="emphasis"><em>deflection
units</em></span>: one scans from left to right, and the other scans
(much more slowly) from top to bottom. Not unexpectedly, these
units are called the <span   class="emphasis"><em>horizontal</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>vertical</em></span> deflection units. You may also
encounter the terms <span   class="emphasis"><em>line</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>frame</em></span> deflection.</p><p>The electron beam can move at only a finite speed. When the
electron beam reaches the right hand side of the screen, it needs
to be deflected back again. This part of the scan is called the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>horizontal retrace</em></span>, and it is not used for
displaying picture data. The actual time that the hardware requires
for the retrace varies, but it is in the order of 5% to 10% of the
total line scan time. Similarly, when the vertical deflection
reaches the bottom of the screen, it performs a <span   class="emphasis"><em>vertical
retrace</em></span>, which is also not used for display.</p><p>It's not enough to just deflect, of course; somehow you need
to ensure that the scanning is synchronized with the incoming
signal, so that the scan is at the top of the screen when the
picture information for the top of the screen arrives. You've all
seen what happens when this doesn't happen; the picture runs up and
down the screen (incorrect vertical synchronization) or tears away
from the left of the screen (incorrect horizontal synchronization).
Synchronization is achieved by including synchronization pulses in
the horizontal and vertical retrace periods. To ensure that they
are recognized as synchronization pulses, they have different
voltage levels from the picture data.</p><p>As if that wasn't enough, the video amplifier, the part of
the TV which alters the intensity of the spot as it travels across
the screen, needs time to ensure that the retrace is invisible, so
there are brief pauses between the end of the line and the start of
the sync pulse, and again between the end of the sync pulse and the
beginning of the data. This process is called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>blanking</em></span>, and the delays are called the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>front porch</em></span> (before the sync pulse) and the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>back porch</em></span> (after the sync pulse).</p><p>In a nutshell, that is how horizontal deflection works.
Vertical deflection works in almost the same way, just slower, with
one minor exception. This basic display mechanism was developed for
TVs in the 1930s, when the term &ldquo;high-tech&rdquo; hadn't even been
invented, and even today we're stuck with the low data rates that
they decided upon in those days. Depending on the country, TVs
display only 25 or 30 frames (pages of display) per second. This
causes an unpleasant flicker in the display. This flicker is
avoided with a trick called <span   class="emphasis"><em>interlacing</em></span>.
Instead of displaying the frame in one vertical scan, the odd and
even lines are displayed in two alternating half frames, which
increases the apparent frame frequency to 50 or 60 Hz.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c8580.0x27c11b8"></a>How Monitors Differ from TVs</h2></div></div><p>So how do we apply this to computer displays? Let's look at
the US standard NTSC system&mdash;the international PAL and SECAM
systems are almost identical except for the number of lines and a
minor difference in the vertical frequency. NTSC specifies 525
lines, but that includes the vertical blanking time, and in fact
only about 480 lines are visible. The aspect ratio of a normal TV
is 4:3, in other words the screen is one-third wider than it is
high, so if we want square pixels, (one with the same height and
width, which makes graphics software much simpler) we need
one-third more pixels per line. This means that we can display 640
pixels per line on 480 lines. (Do these numbers look familiar? Now
you know why.)
</p><p>This resolution is normally abbreviated to &ldquo;640*480&rdquo;. PAL and
SECAM have lower vertical frequencies, which allow a nominal 625
lines, of which about 580 are displayed. Either way, these values
have two huge disadvantages: first, they are interlaced displays,
and second, the resolution is the minimum acceptable for modern
graphics displays. Older PC display hardware, such as the CGA and
some EGA modes, was capable of generating these signal frequencies,
but VGAs can no longer do it. This is a pity, in some ways; I'd
like to have an X display on my TV in the lounge room, but my last
EGA adaptor died a couple of years ago.</p><p>The first problem with these standards is interlace. It works
reasonably for TVs, but it's a pain for computer displays&mdash;there's
still more flicker than with a real 50 Hz or 60 Hz display. VGAs
can still be run in interlace mode, but you shouldn't even think
about doing so unless you're into masochism. The second problem is
the resolution; nowadays, 1024*768 is a normal enough resolution,
but I'm writing this on a display with 1280*1024, and many modern
boards display 1600*1200. On the other hand, even 60 Hz refresh
rate is barely adequate. Read any marketing literature and you'll
discover that 72 Hz is the point at which flicker suddenly
disappears. To get high-resolution, high-refresh-rate displays, you
need some very high internal frequencies&mdash;we'll see how high
further down.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c8580.0x27c1370"></a>How to Fry Your Monitor</h2></div></div><p>Now we know that a monitor is just a glorified TV. TVs were
designed to use the same circuitry for the horizontal deflection as
well as generation of the high voltage required for the CRT. This
simplified the hardware design at the expense of versatility loss.
The flyback transformer which generates the high voltage is part of
a resonant circuit which can only operate at one frequency. Run a
flyback transformer off its intended frequency and it will run much
less efficiently and use more power. This additional power will be
dissipated in the flyback transformer and horizontal output
transistor as heat. The result can be the failure of the flyback
transformer, the transistor, or both.
</p><p>You don't have to roll your own X configuration to burn out
the monitor. Ten years ago, the standard display boards were CGAs
(Color Graphics Adapter) and HDAs (Hercules Display Adapter) and
they had different horizontal deflection frequencies and thus
required different monitors. If you connected an HDA (18.43 kHz
horizontal deflection frequency) to a CGA monitor (15.75 kHz, the
NTSC horizontal deflection frequency), you could expect smoke
signals within a few minutes.</p><p>In modern PC monitors the horizontal deflection and high
voltage generation circuits have been separated. Called multi-sync
monitors, they are capable of running at a range of deflection
frequencies. Running at any of the frequencies in the specified
range will work, but it is still possible to damage the monitor by
running it out of the specified range. Note that just beacuse a
monitor displays the image correctly doesn't mean that it is
running in spec. I have a rather elderly Eizo 9500 (called Nanao in
the US) which has three frequencies: (exactly) 31.5 kHz, 48 to 50
kHz, or 64 to 78 kHz. In fact, it will display at any frequency
between 48 and 78 kHz, but if it were run at 57 kHz for any length
of time, I would be in for a hefty repair bill. The moral of the
story: <span   class="bold"><b>Don't ever run your monitor out of
spec</b></span>. If your display is screwed up, there's a good
chance that the frequencies are out. <span   class="bold"><b>Turn off
the monitor</b></span>.</p><p>Monitors aren't the only thing that you can burn out, of
course. If you try hard, you can also burn out chips on some
display boards by running them at frequencies which are out of
spec. In practice, though, this doesn't happen nearly as
often.</p><p>Another difference between TVs and monitors is the kind of
signal they take. A real TV includes a receiver, of course, so you
have an antenna connection, but modern TVs also have connections
for inputs from VCRs, which are usually an audio signal and a video
signal. The video signal consists of five important parts: the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>red</em></span> signal, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>green</em></span>
signal, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>blue signal</em></span>, and the horizontal
and vertical sync pulses. This kind of signal is called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>composite video</em></span>. By contrast, most modern
monitors separate these signals onto separate signal lines, and
older boards, such as the EGA, even use several lines per colour.
Unfortunately, there is no complete agreement about how these
signals should work; the polarity of the sync pulses varies from
one board to the next, and some boards cheat and supply the sync
pulses on the green signal line. This is mainly of historical
interest, but occasionally you'll come across a real bargain 20"
monitor which only has 3 signal connections, and you may not be
able to get it to work&mdash;this could be one of the reasons.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c8580.0x27c17e8"></a>The CRT Controller</h2></div></div><p>The display controller, usually called a CRT (Cathode Ray
Tube) controller, is the part of the display board which creates
the signals we've just been talking about. Early display
controllers were designed to produce signals that were compatible
with TVs. They had to produce a signal with sync pulses, front and
back porches, and picture data in between. Modern display
controllers can do a lot more, but the principles remain the same.
</p><p>The first part of the display controller creates the
framework we're looking for: the horizontal and vertical sync
pulses, blanking, and picture information, which is represented as
a series of points or <span   class="emphasis"><em>dots</em></span>. To count, we need
a pulse source, which also determines the duration of individual
dots, so it is normally called a <span   class="emphasis"><em>dot clock</em></span>.
For reasons lost in history, CRT controllers start counting at the
top left of the display, and not at the vertical sync pulse, which
is the real beginning of the display. To define a line to the
horizontal deflection, we need to set four CRTC registers to tell
it:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Horizontal Display End</em></span>
(HDE) register specifies how many dots we want on each line. After
the CRTC has counted this many pixels, it stops outputting picture
data to the display.</p></li><li><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Start Horizontal Retrace</em></span>
(SHR) register specifies how many dot clock pulses occur before the
sync pulse starts. The difference between the contents of this
register and the contents of the HDE register defines the length of
the front porch.</p></li><li><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>End Horizontal Retrace</em></span>
(EHR) register defines the end of the sync pulse. The width of the
sync pulse is the difference between the contents of this register
and the SHR register.</p></li><li><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Horizontal Total</em></span> (HT)
register defines the total number of dot clocks per line. The width
of the back porch is the difference between the contents of this
register and the EHR register.</p></li></ul></div><p>In addition, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Start Horizontal
Blanking</em></span> (SHB) and <span   class="emphasis"><em>End Horizontal
Blanking</em></span> (EHB) registers define when the video signals
are turned off and on. The server sets these registers
automatically, so we don't need to look at them in more detail.
</p><p>The control of the vertical deflection is similar. In this
case, the registers are <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vertical Display End</em></span>
(VDE), <span   class="emphasis"><em>Start Vertical Retrace</em></span> (SVR),
<span   class="emphasis"><em>End Vertical Retrace</em></span> (EVR), <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vertical
Total</em></span> (VT), <span   class="emphasis"><em>Start Vertical Blanking</em></span>
(SVB), and <span   class="emphasis"><em>End Vertical Blanking</em></span> (EVB). The
values in these registers are counted in lines.</p><p>VGA hardware evolved out of older 8 bit character-based
display hardware, which counted lines in characters, not dot
clocks. As a result, all of these registers are 8 bits wide. This
was adequate for character displays, but it's a problem when
counting dots. The maximum value you can set in any of these
registers is 255. The designers of the VGA resorted to a number of
nasty kludges to get around this problem. The horizontal registers
count in groups of 8 dot clocks, so they can represent up to 2048
dot clocks. The vertical registers overflow into an overflow
register. Even so, the standard VGA can't count beyond 1024 lines.
Super VGAs vary in how they handle this problem, but typically they
add additional overflow bits. To give you an idea of how clean the
VGA design is, on a standard VGA, the real Vertical Total (total
number of lines on the display) is defined as the value of the VT
register +256 if bit 0 of the overflow register is set, or +512 if
bit 5 of the overflow register is set.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c8580.0x2bba488"></a>The XF86Config Mode Line</h2></div></div><p>One of the steps in setting up XFree86 is to define these
register values. Fortunately, you don't have to worry about which
bits to set in the overflow register. The mode lines count in dots,
and it's up to the server to convert the dot count into something
that the display board can understand. A typical Mode line looks
like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
"640x480a" 28 640 680 728 776 480 480 482 494
</pre><p>These ten values are required. In addition, you may specify
   modifiers at the end of the line. The values are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A label for the resolution line. This must be
enclosed in quotation marks, and is used to refer to the line from
other parts of the XF86Config file. It is the only optional
field&mdash;further down we'll look at what happens if it isn't present.
Traditionally, the label represents the resolution of the display
mode, but it doesn't have to. In this example, the resolution
really is 640*480, but the a at the end of the label is a clue that
it's an alternative value.</p></li><li><p>The clock frequency. This may be a label, like the
mode line label, but sometimes it really does have to match the
clock frequency in MHz.</p></li><li><p>The Horizontal Display End, which goes into the HDE
register. This value and all that follow are specified in dots. The
server mangles them as the display board requires and puts them in
the corresponding CRTC register.</p></li><li><p>The Start Horizontal Retrace (SHR) value.</p></li><li><p>The End Horizontal Retrace (EHR) value.</p></li><li><p>The Horizontal Total (HT) value.</p></li><li><p>The Vertical Display End (VDE) value. This value
and the three following are specified in lines.</p></li><li><p>The Start Vertical Retrace (SVR) value.</p></li><li><p>The End Vertical Retrace (EVR) value.</p></li><li><p>The Vertical Total (VT) value.</p></li></ul></div><p>As I noted, not every mode line needs a label. It's possible to
have a number of mode lines for the same resolution, each with a
different dot clock frequency. In this case, only the first line of
a group needs the label.</p><p>This is pretty dry stuff. To make it easier to understand,
let's look at how we would set a typical VGA display with 640*480
pixels. Sure, you can find values for this setup in any release of
XFree86, but that doesn't mean that they're the optimum for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>your system</em></span>. We want a no-flicker display,
which we'll take to mean a vertical frequency of at least 72 Hz,
and of course we don't want interlace. Our multiscan monitor can
any handle horizontal frequency between 15 and 40 kHz, so let's
head for the highest and see what happens.</p><p>First, we need to create our lines. They contain 640 pixels,
two porches, and a sync pulse. The only value we really know for
sure is the number of pixels. How long should the porches and the
sync pulses be? If you have a good monitor with good documentation,
it should tell you, but most monitor manufacturers don't seem to
believe in good documentation. When they do document the values,
they vary significantly from monitor to monitor, and even from mode
to mode. They're not as critical as they look. For example, here
are some typical values from my NEC 5D handbook&mdash;Horizontal sync
pulse: 1 to 4 &micro;s, front porch 0.18 to 2.1 &micro;s, back
porch 1.25 to 3.56 &micro;s.</p><p>As we'll see, the proof of these timing parameters is in the
display. If the display looks good, the parameters are OK. I don't
know of any way to damage the monitor purely by modifying these
parameters, but there are other good reasons to stick to this
range. As a rule of thumb, if you set each of the three values to 2
&micro;s to start with, you won't go too far wrong. Alternatively,
you could start with the NTSC standard values. The standard
specifies that the horizontal sync pulse lasts for 4.2 to 5.1
i&micro;s, the front porch must be at least 1.27 &micro;s. NTSC
doesn't define the length of the back porch&mdash;Winstead it defines
the total line blanking, which lasts for 8.06 to 10.3 &micro;s. For
our purposes, we can consider the back porch to be the length of
the total blanking minus the lengths of the front porch and the
sync pulse. If you take values somewhere in the middle of the
ranges, you get a front porch of 1.4 &micro;s, a sync pulse of 4.5
&micro;s, and total blanking 9 &micro;s, which implies a back porch
of 9 - 1.4 - 4.5 = 3.1 &micro;s.</p><p>For our example, let's stick to 2 &micro;s per value. We have
a horizontal frequency of 40 kHz, or 25 &micro;s per line. After
taking off our 6 &micro;s of total blanking time, we have only 19
&micro;s left for the display data. In order to get 640 pixels in
this time, we need one pixel every 19/640 &micro;s, or about 30 ns.
This corresponds to a frequency of 33.6 MHz. This is our desired
dot clock.</p><p>The next question is: Do we have a dot clock of this
frequency? Maybe. This should be in your display board
documentation, but I'll take a bet that it's not. Never mind, the
XFree86 server is clever enough to figure this out for
itself&mdash;we'll see how the next article. At the moment, let's assume
that you do have a dot clock of 33 MHz. You now need to calculate
four register values to define the horizontal lines:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The first value is the Horizontal Display End, the
number of pixels on a line. That's easy enough&mdash;it's 640.</p></li><li><p>You calculate SHR by adding the number of dot
clocks that elapse during the front porch to the value of HDE.
Recall that we decided on a front porch of 2 &micro;s. In this
time, a 33 MHz clock will count 66 cycles. So we add 66, right?
Wrong. Remember that the VGA registers count in increments of 8
pixels, so we need to round the width of the front porch to a
multiple of 8. In this case, we round it to 64, so we set SHR to
640 + 64 = 704.</p></li><li><p>The next value we need is EHR, which is SHR plus
the width of the horizontal retrace, again 64 dot clocks, so we set
that to 704 + 64 = 768.</p></li><li><p>The final horizontal value is HT. Again, we add the
front porch&mdash;64 dot clocks&mdash;to EHR and get 768 + 64 = 832.</p></li></ul></div><p>Next, we need another four values to define the vertical
scan. Again, of the four values we need, we only know the number of
lines. How many lines do we use for the porches and the vertical
sync? As we've seen, NTSC uses about 45 lines for the three
combined, but in practice modern monitors get by with many fewer.
Again referring to the Multisync manual, we get a front porch of
betwwen 0.014 and 1.2 &micro;s, a sync pulse of between 0.06 and
0.113 &micro;s, and a back porch of between 0.54 and 1.88 &micro;s.
But how many lines is that?</p><p>To figure that out, we need to know our
<span   class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> horizontal frequency. We were aiming at
40 kHz, but we made a couple of tradeoffs along the way. The real
horizontal frequency is the dot clock divided by the horizontal
total, in this case 33 MHz / 832, which gives us 39.66 kHz&mdash;not bad
at all. At that frequency, a line lasts just over 25 &micro;s, so
our front porch can range between &frac12; and 48 lines, our sync
pulse between 2 and 5 lines, and the back porch between 10 and 75
lines. Do these timings make any sense? No, they don't&mdash;they're
just values which the monitor can accept.</p><p>In practice, we can go for the lowest value in each case.
It's difficult to specify a value of &frac12;, so we'll take a
single line front porch. We'll take two lines of sync pulse and 10
lines of back porch. This gives us:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>VDE is 480.</p></li><li><p>SVR is 481.</p></li><li><p>EVR is 483.</p></li><li><p>VT is 493.</p></li></ul></div><p>Now we can calculate our vertical frequency, which is the
horizontal frequency divided by the vertical total, or 39.66/493
kHz, which is 80.4 Hz&mdash;not bad at all. By comparison, if you use
