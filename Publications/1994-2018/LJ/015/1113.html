    Make those graphics come alive with the 3-Dimensional
    replacement set Xaw3D.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fec580.0x20e43a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>After months of being stuck in my CLI
(Command Line Interface) mode, I finally broke down and installed
X11R6 on my Linux machine. It's nothing to write home about,
really, just a 386/40 which three years ago was state of the art.
Oh well. At least I have graphics and can finally see the neat
pictures on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Trek: Voyager</em></span> WWW site.
It also gave me a chance to put my mouse to work after it collected
months of dust.
</p><p>Taking the defaults that XFree 3.1.1 gave me, I found myself
inside fvwm and its Motif-like interface, wishing that other
programs also had a Motif-like interface. Motif has many
advantages, but the drawback is that it costs money that many of us
don't have (yet). One of the features that Motif provides is a 3-D
interface for buttons and other portions of a window known as
widgets. These widgets are designed such that the developer of the
software determines what widgets to use and how they work, and the
end user is allowed to change how the widgets are displayed. This
is similar to the way that X without Motif works now.</p><p>To make your screen more 3-D like, there is a drop-in
replacement for the Athena Widget set called Xaw3D. The Athena
Widgets define how the scroll bars on the side of the screen work.
By default, the widgets make the scroll bar for a program like
xedit look like what you see in <a href="1113f1.jpg" target="_self">Figure
1</a>. Functional, yet somewhat bland.</p><p>The replacement 3-D libraries make xedit look more like
<a href="1113f2.jpg" target="_self">Figure 2</a>. You'll notice three areas
where Xaw3D has made its presence known. The buttons on the top of
the window, the scroll bar on the left, and the three section
markers on the top right-hand area.</p><p>You can get the 3-D widgets in most of the popular Linux FTP
sites, including sunsite.unc.edu as
/pub/linux/libs/X/libXaw3d_X11R6.tar.gz. There are also libraries
for Xfree 2.1 along with the Xaw3d sources in the same
directory.</p><p>The installation is pretty straightforward, but you have to
be root. There are instructions in the libXaw3d_X11R6.readme file.
Tar and uncompress the libXaw3d_X11R6.tar.gz file with:</p><p><b  >tar -zxvC / -f
libXaw3d_X11R6.tar.gz</b></p><p>then update the shared libraries:
</p><p><b  >ldconfig</b></p><p>The -C tells tar to untar in the root directory. Since the
tar file contains the directory structure to put the libs in
usr/X11R5/lib, the -C / will place the file in the correct
directory without having to move it all around. Note that this will
replace the libXaw.so.6.0 file that already exists there, so you
may want to back it up. The ldconfig will update the file links for
you, so you don't need to make the common mistake of erasing the
library by using the ln command incorrectly.</p><p>Once this library is installed, this will only affect
dynamically linked libraries. There are other packages available in
the same directories as above that provide the libraries for
statically-linked programs, should you need them: Most users
probably won't.</p><p>The next time you start X-Windows, you'll notice changes in
the scroll bar and other widgets that normally use the Xaw set. You
can also make changes to the appearance of these widgets, using the
~/.Xdefaults file to configure Xaw.</p><p>You can use the <span   class="emphasis"><em>*shadowWidth</em></span> resource to
change how each widget displays itself, and you can see the results
of your changes by merely saving the file to ~/.Xdefaults and then
starting up a new program that uses scroll bars or buttons that are
statically linked. Two good examples for this are xterm and
xedit.</p><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>*Label*shadowWidth</em></span> resource defines
the depth of the label widgets to make them appear 3-D. You can add
a shadow by setting this number, for example, to 2.</p><p>One of the best ways, however, to figure out what each widget
does is to borrow someone else's configuration. Michael K. Johnson
was kind enough to provide me with a copy of his .Xdefaults, and
I've made my own revisions, which are shown in Figure 3.</p><p>! For Xaw3d! gives everything that Motif look to it. Sort
