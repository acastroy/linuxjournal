software, and I have failed to understand completely what he meant.
I associate &ldquo;free&rdquo; with &ldquo;without cost&rdquo;, and since I spend very
little on software anyway, I have felt no need to use &ldquo;free
software&rdquo;. I did not until recently understand that the freedom to
change the software, which access to the source code provides, is
far more important than lack of cost.
</p><p>This misunderstanding is widespread. Therefore, I would like
to propose an alternate term for software with source
code&mdash;&ldquo;liberated&rdquo; software. Liberated software liberates the
programmer.  &mdash;Daniel L. Johnson, M.D.,
F.A.C.P <a href="mailto:johnsond@uwstout.edu">johnsond@uwstout.edu</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee7580.0x1fdf298"></a>Usefulness</h2></div></div><p>Once again I'm at work in front of my HP workstation, about
to request more information on a software product I noticed in an
<i  >LJ</i> ad, that just might solve a problem a
co-worker asked me about last week. A few months ago my system
administrator bought BRU (from an <i  >LJ</i> ad I gave
him) for an HP workstation headed to a tele-commuting co-worker's
house. I occasionally daydream about having time to explore my
Linux system at home, but I consistently read
<i  >LJ</i> because its columns, articles, and
advertisements give me information I use at work.  &mdash;Greg
Deitrick <a href="mailto:deitrick@shell.com">deitrick@shell.com</a>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee7580.0x1fdf500"></a>Thanks!</h2></div></div><p>I would like to say that I was absolutely impressed with the
May issue of the <i  >Linux Journal</i>, especially with the articles which
dealt directly with system administration such as how to set up a
WWW site, the article of an ISP using Linux, the Majordomo
setup/configuration article, etc.
</p><p>Keep up the good work. Now I remember why I subscribed to
this magazine in the first place!  &mdash;John
Coy <a href="mailto:jcoy@magic.yournet.com">jcoy@magic.yournet.com</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee7580.0x1fdf710"></a>PVM</h2></div></div><p>Several times your articles have mentioned a guy from NASA
who uses PVM instead of supercomputers, and that he gave a talk on
it at a conference, etc.
</p><p>Please have him, or someone in attendance, paraphrase what he
is doing, and perhaps speculate that nnn Pentium 90's equals such
and such Supercomputer, at so many gigaflops, etc.</p><p>Please also consider a `Porting Corner' article every month
to summarize the progress of ports to other computers (i.e. Alpha,
MIPS, PowerPC, etc). Only a quarter page or smaller would be
required, with a line or two on each port.  &mdash;Doug Fortune</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee7580.0x1fdf8c8"></a><i  >LJ</i> Responds:</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>In response to your first point, we do intend to
have an article on this system. However, there is no way to say
that nnn Pentium 90's is equivalent to any supercomputer; a
loosely-coupled parallel system like that works well only on
certain problem domains. We intend to have an article on the
Beowulf system, but it is currently an ongoing research project,
and is not ready for an article at this time.</em></span>
</p><p>The architects of Beowulf are about to build a
second-generation system based on their current experience and
research with their first system, and the results from that system
will be more interesting and worthwhile to readers with a serious
use for the technology. All the software that they are using will
be released as a package, and when it is, we will certainly pursue
an article.</p><p>In response to your second point, progress on the ports to
various architectures does not progress in a way that facilitates
monthly reporting. We will report on significant progress on the
ports. In particular, our &ldquo;Stop The Presses&rdquo; article in this issue
mentions that the Linux/Alpha port is now self-hosting. We will
also report on the state of all ports from time to time, as we did
recently.</p><p><a href="2679s1.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Corrections</b></span></a></p></div></div>
