    Every wonder what it's like to write a driver under Linux?
    Here's a summary of one hacker's experiences.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20ff580.0x21f73a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>It started out innocently enough. I had
been looking for an upgrade for my home system, a decrepit Unix
workstation with only 8MB RAM and 40MB disk. I had been looking at
386BSD, but was a bit put off by the AT&amp;T lawsuit and such.
Suddenly last September I noticed this other system, Linux, and saw
articles pointing to distribution sets. I copied a set to some
floppies (on a Sun system, ugh) and borrowed a partition on a
client's system that normally runs MS-DOS.
</p><p>When I discovered how easily Linux loaded and how well it
functioned, I knew I had the answer. I spent much of my monthly
billing of that client to order a hefty 486 through their
purchasing agent. I was a little concerned about assembling the
pieces, but the guys in the manufacturing area were interested to
see how it worked. I couldn't have kept them from putting it
together if I had wanted to.</p><p>All this was very timely. I had to get back to my studies and
finish my dissertation if I were ever going to graduate. Although I
had access to plenty of systems over the Internet, it would have
been messy analyzing the data from afar. With all the X tools now
available on my new system, my work from home was greatly improved.
For all this, I owed the Linux community a lot for the tools upon
which I so thoroughly depended.</p><p>Then came my chance to pay back this debt (and benefit as
well). Phil Hughes posted the following on a local Linux mail
list:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
... anyone out there want to write a driver for the Cyclades serial
board? This is an ISA-bus card with a Cirrus Logic RISC processor
on it....
Why do you want to do this?
1. Linux needs it :-)
2. You will get a free 8-port board for your effort
What you have to do:
1. Write a driver that really works and make it
   available on the net.
2. Write an article on this for <i  >Linux Journal</i>
</pre><p>That sounded like a bargain! I immediately sent off a note
saying I would be up to the task. I had done a lot of OS internals
in the '70s, hacked in the BSD Unix kernel in the '80s, and had
done some PC drivers in the last few years. That seemed to persuade
Phil I could do the job. He wrote that his &ldquo;big fear was that
people who had no idea what a device driver is would decide to try
to write a driver so they could get a free board&rdquo;.</p><p>Things then went on hold while I finished up that last of the
notes for my defense. (Actually I was hoping my advisor wouldn't
ask what I was up to.) Fortunately it took a while for us to work
out the details and for the card to arrive, so I didn't look bad by
the delay. The developer's kit that finally arrived had a wealth of
information: a 130-page data sheet on the Cirrus chip and lots of
code fragments showing how the board is accessed. With that stuff
in hand, I finally got to work inside the kernel.</p><p>The character tty-like interface is implemented across
several files. Some look at the high-level part of the data flow;
implementing the canonical character processing, newline to
carriage return conversions, command line echoing, escape character
processing, and such. The others are involved with controlling the
devices; the console, the keyboard, and the serial lines. I started
my driver by copying serial.c and changing all the names of the
form rs_something to cy_something. I then had to hook this new
low-level driver to the the system. There are two routines that are
called to do this: cy_init and cy_open. Once these are slipped into
tty_io.c, the Cyclades driver development is limited to the new
file, cyclades.c.</p><p>The very first part was recognizing the boards and
initializing the data structures. There was suitable code from
Cyclades to do the former and the serial.c code took care of the
latter. One major difference appeared. The serial.c code was based
on the design where each port had its own IRQ which was to be
deactivated when the port was closed. I had to move the IRQ setup
code into the board initialization. The inital success was to boot
the system and get the message reporting that the board and its
ports were present.</p><p>The next phase was to fix up the cy_open routine. Once I
stripped out the IRQ stuff, the rest was mostly to establish the
link between the low-level driver and the high-level driver. This
didn't need much of a change at all. I just added a subroutine call
to initialize the port on the card, setting character size, baud
rate, modem control signals, etc. That seemed to work, so I went on
to the next part.</p><p>Then it got scary; actually sending characters. Again, using
code from serial.c as an outline (hinting strongly where something
has to to be done to the hardware), I changed cy_write and
cy_interrupt.</p><p>cy_write is called whenever the high-level driver has queued
characters to be sent. The serial.c version actually stuffed some
of the initial characters into a hardware register, which starts
sending characters out. I changed this so that I only enabled
interrupts; the interrupt service routine would be the only code
that put characters on the wire.</p><p>The interrupt service was even more scary. For the first
time, code would be executed outside of the context of the calling
program. If things went astray, it would be really hard to figure
out where. Fortunately the code fragments from Cyclades and from
serial.c merged without too much difficulty. Whenever an interrupt
occurs, it indicates that something on the board needs tending to.
It's a simple matter of programming ( :-)) to poll each of the
chips to see if any of their four ports need attention, and if so,
whether it is for transmit, receive, or modem conditions. With some
trepidation I compiled these changes and rebuilt and rebooted the
kernel. A simple test: date &gt; /dev/ttyC0 worked!</p><p>I was glad I had made this much progress because about this
time I got a query from Cyclades. They wanted to know how things
were going. With some relief I replied I was actively testing
&ldquo;increasingly feature-full versions of the driver.&rdquo;</p><p>This was well received. They had issued a small advertisement
regarding a Linux driver and were starting to get responses. To me
this was also good news. There would be a pool of folks to test my
code.</p><p>I continued my efforts, working up my courage to try the
receive side, as well as addressing a mysterious (to me) kernel
crash. As part of my tests, I was actually issuing the command
&ldquo;sync&rdquo; just prior to the test transmission, so the kernel crashes
hadn't hurt anything yet.</p><p>I traced the crash to a pointer that was being cleared
prematurely. By comparing the serial.c code with my code, I
discovered I had moved too many things around. Some minor checks in
cy_close fixed that. (I also explored how I might get some kind of
display out of the console showing what's going on. I looked around
and found that although printk() isn't always appropriate for
messages from within interrupt service routines (if ever),
console_print() can be called anytime if interrupts are turned off.
A little effort allowed me to sprinkle single character messages
showing how far a routine had progressed. More calls to
console_print() allowed me to zero in on what went wrong.) Finally,
after making the best of the Memorial Day weekend, I reported the
following:</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20ff580.0x21f7a80"></a>Capabilities</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>auto-detects card and uses assigned IRQ for given

operation</p></li></ul></div><p>And a few days later I added:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>It appears the problem I reported for the
Cyclodes driver is actually deeper within the kernel and appears
with the other asynchronous drivers, i.e., it was there to begin
with. Therefore I will ignore this problem for the moment, since
the other ports work for all applications I know, and focus on
getting the rest of the features right. First will be speed and
line mode stuff, then the modem control.</p></blockquote></div><p>and then:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I've dropped in the speed setting code and tested
it at speeds up to 19200. Once I rig some kind of loop-back cable,
I'll check higher speeds.</p></blockquote></div><p>It now recognizes parity errors and break, the wait-on-open
feature works, and multiple simultaneous sends and receives have
been tested. The upgrade to kernel 1.1.8 is done and I'm working
with some other folks on testing it more rigorously.</p><p>Checking back in my log one can see how I worked in spurts. I
spent a bit over a week overall on this, mostly in day-long chunks.
This was after a lot of hour-long periods reading the
documentation.</p><p>So what did I gain and would I do it again?</p><p>I got a chance to pay my debt to the community. I got to play
inside the kernel. I'm more confident that I can write drivers for
this system and get them to work. I also got a mux board.</p><p>I'm not sure I would do it again. Not that it was that
demanding, but it did take time. I don't think the gains would be
as great the second time around. Still, if an interesting-enough
device was offered to me, I'd be tempted.</p></div></div>
