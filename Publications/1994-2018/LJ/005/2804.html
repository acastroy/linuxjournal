    One of the first people to see a commercial use for Linux
    was Dr. Greg Wettstein at the Roger Maris Cancer Center. A
    few months after Linux was first announced, he saw the
    potential for an operating system capable of running a large
    patient care system, and has seen his vision vidicated so
    far. This is his story.

Linux</h2></div></div><p>I still remember the lone dollar prompt springing to life on
the monitor of a lowly 80386sx in my office as it booted Linux for
the first time. The appearance of that single dollar sign has
proven to be possibly one of the most seminal moments in the
history of the Roger Maris Cancer Center, and of my professional
career. The birth of this free operating system in an environment
previously dominated by commercial software was to have profound
ramifications on both the quality and efficiency of the care our
staff provides to our patients.
</p><p>I had watched with interest the early announcements Linus
made on the networks about a Unix clone he was writing called
Linux. Consumed by work and development pressures, I did not allow
myself the indulgence of playing around with the new offering for
fear of engaging in yet another eternal timesink. Eventually,
overcome by curiosity, I decided to take the plunge and investigate
Linux. Our experiences have far exceeded our expectations; Linux
certainly is a wonderful timesink...</p><p>The actual incentive and decision to move toward an free/open
systems approach to our information processing needs occurred at a
much earlier time. I had been recruited in 1988 to serve on a team
whose goal was to develop a comprehensive cancer care facility. The
only perk I asked for was an 80386-based computer, since my
instincts told me that the advent of this microprocessor into the
personal computer market was going to revolutionize desktop
computing.</p><p>Our medical director, Dr. Paul Etzell, was intrigued by my
request and wanted to know why I thought this. I told him, &ldquo;Because
it can multi-task and handle large amounts of memory the way it is
supposed to.'' He was excited and told me that he had always
dreamed of a specialized patient information system for his cancer
center. Armed with this mandate, a 16Mhz 80386sx ALR, and a Xenix
2.3.3 development system we set out to design new solutions to
problems in the delivery of outpatient cancer care. We deliver care
that allows patients to have their treatment and still conduct a
somewhat 'normal' lifestyle.</p><p>That was in 1988. The Roger Maris Cancer Center has now grown
to be a major regional treatment and referral center. Medical care,
chemotherapy, and radiation therapy are provided to approximately
125 patients with a diagnosis of either cancer or hematologic
(blood) diseases each day. A total of 13 physicians deliver cancer
care supported by a staff of approximately 100 people and 25 Linux
workstations. The Cancer Center is a distinct service line of the
MeritCare Medical Group which consists of approximately 250
physicians and 2000+ employees supporting one central clinic, a 400
bed hospital and 25 regional clinics. For everyone with aspirations
for Linux in the commercial environment, we are about as commercial
as things get.</p><p>When the first Linux dollar prompt appeared, our Cancer
Center was not naive about free software. I had already ported a
number of the GNU tools to Xenix in an attempt to produce a
suitable development environment. By this time our Cancer Center
was supported by two 33Mhz 80386dx's (Gateway-2000's), the ALR
having been mercifully put to rest.</p><p>However, compared to compilers, editors and utilities, an
operating system is a completely different beast. As I sat staring
at the screen contemplating the fact that a machine that had been
previously sentenced to MS-DOS was now quietly multi-tasking, I
couldn't even believe what was in front of me. Could something that
I had ftp'ed for free from some distant spot in Finland really be
capable of playing a role in our development plans?</p><p>At our morning coffee I looked across the table at Dr. Etzell
and quietly commented that I might have run across something that
could have a profound impact on the Cancer Center.</p><p>Linux has had that profound impact because of the doors which
it has opened for us. Our medical director, a true visionary, knew
that the face of medicine would be radically changing. True to his
prediction, the medical community in the United States is facing
extreme pressure to deliver high-quality, cost-effective care. If
our Cancer Center was to survive, let alone thrive in this
environment it would be critical to innovate and adapt quickly. The
reason that Linux has had such a profound impact is that it has
provided us with the tools necessary for this evolutionary
process.</p><p>It probably goes without saying that a decentralized system
of peer-to-peer networked workstations was not the same vision that
corporate data processing possessed for us. Based exclusively on
centralized mainframe processing, the corporate wheels were turning
toward network solutions, but a network whose main purpose was to
deliver datastreams from mainframes to diskless workstations;
expensive terminals connected by expensive wiring. Our vision was
of independent workstations capable of functioning without network
connections if need be, but also capable of utilizing networking to
enjoy extreme synergism in their daily tasks.</p><p>If this was to be our gospel then it was up to Linux to
preach it for us. The dichotomy in vision ensured that there would
be no funds available for our work. Linux and free software
provided the tools to implement our strategy in the absence of
official support. With Xenix and no money for upgrades there was no
potential for X-windows, and most importantly no money for the
TCP/IP networking which was central to our development
strategy.</p><p>This is not to say that Linux was a magical solution that
revolutionized our method of patient care overnight. The first
dollar prompt was actually from a bootdisk/rootdisk combination (I
am dating myself here) that was version 0.95a (one of those really
weird version numbers) in early 1992. At that point in its
development Linux was far from the workstation contender that it
now is. I developed application software furiously on the Xenix
boxes while I nursed a stable Linux environment into existence. The
bulk of our application code was in PERL/TeX/C which I knew would
be available in only a matter of time on Linux.</p><p>All the development on Linux was done on a 20Mhz 80386sx
(Gateway-2000) with a 120MB disk drive. This machine was tied
back-to-back through serial ports with one of the Xenix machines
whose 300MB hard drive provided a safe haven for the development
sources. It is a true testimony to Linus and the other developers
that we never experienced a filesystem crash or lost data during
the development process. In fact, the original 20Mhz machine is
still in service, still using the original Minix root filesystem
written to its hard drive with 0.96a.</p><p>It wasn't until about 0.96c that Linux actually began to
shoulder operational responsibilities. This was mainly due to the
fact that 0.96c was the first release whose serial drivers would
reliably withstand a UUCICO session. Our concept of 'networking' at
that point was file relay and remote execution via UUX, making
reliable serial communications essential.</p><p>During the 0.95-0.96 stages our development efforts were
focused on putting together what would be called a distribution in
today's parlance. Reality dictated that a reliable means of
replicating and updating Linux would be required if multiple
machines were to be committed to service. During this time I wrote
the first version of StopAlop [StopAlop stands for &rdquo;Stop Alopocea&ldquo;
(a medical term for hair loss) or &rdquo;Stop A lot of problems&ldquo;].
StopAlop allowed us to package Linux into a series of modules which
could be installed, verified and updated independently, reliably,
and with version control. Our installations centered on a 'base'
module which was everything needed for a standalone UUCP-capable
Unix workstation. Additional modules provided our appli-cation
code, emacs, a development environment, text processing (TeX), and
ultimately networking and X11.</p><p>When reliable kernels arrived we were prepared with a
well-tested, reliable system environment. Our application software
was already maturing and in operation under Xenix. As we began
deploying Linux, our medical director began negotiations which
ultimately provided the hardware resources necessary to formulate
our peer-to-peer distributed computing environment. No small part
of his efforts were focused on negotiating for corporate survival
of our fledgling project.</p><p>His efforts were enhanced by the profound impact that Linux
began to have on our operations. No longer encumbered by the
restriction of two licensed copies of an operating system, we were
able to immediately deploy four additional workstations. Our
application software hosted on these machines provided patient
information, patient tracking, drug history databases, pharmacy
support and automated patient charting to patient care environments
which were largely non-automated.</p><p>Our most powerful argument to detractors (who were vocal) was
that the systems being put into place were functioning well, were
tuned to our application needs, were substantially increasing
productivity, and had cost nothing over and above the hardware
costs. The most astounding point made was that the workstations
accomplishing these feats had been rescued from the fate of being
diskless DOS network clients...</p><p>From this point we have progressed, passing some notable
milestones. Six months after the first Linux machine began tracking
patients, a major user-interface move was made by changing from
using multiple virtual consoles to X. Serial connections were
established between the Prime computer, which hosted laboratory
information, and the Linux workstations. Receptionists and staff
members who sometimes had three different computers and/or
terminals to contend with were now interacting with different
information sources via multiple xterms on the same display.</p><p>The most significant milestone occurred the day the
concentrators were plugged in connecting all the workstations via
10baseT Ethernet. With high-speed TCP/IP connections between the
workstations, our goal and vision of a peer-to-peer distributed
information support environment was complete. The gospel according
to Linux was named Perceptions; a name chosen to personify the
design goal of our adventure, to provide a unified resource which
would enable staff members at the Roger Maris Cancer Center to have
a clear information picture of the patients they were taking care
of. In December of 1993 the 'big red switch' was pulled on the last
Xenix machine and our Cancer Center and its operations became
totally dependent on Linux.</p><p>The story of Linux and Perceptions is the truest example of
why I feel that 'free' software can play an important role in the
commercial marketplace. The speed at which we were able to
accomplish our goal is a direct result of our ability to innovate
and respond to environmental needs. The impediments to our
accomplishments were reduced to only what we were individually
capable of developing and supporting. We called the shots, we made
the decisions, if something didn't work we fixed it. It was these
experiences that caused us to form the motto: I would rather spend
10 hours reading someone else's source code than 10 minutes
listening to Musak waiting for technical support which
isn't.''</p><p>The real basis of our success is, in part, the large, diffuse
network of Linux Activists who made what we did possible. It is
always easy to make good design decisions when you have good data
to make those decisisons with. I read literally thousands of Usenet
articles to make sure that I knew everything there was to know
about the stability of kernels, what software worked and what
didn't, and most importantly, how to fix what didn't work. On the
basis of the experiences of hundreds or thousands of other people I
made good design decisions. Good design decisions lead to
successful implementations, which was really the bottom line of our
survival. As Dr. Etzell so aptly put it, &rdquo;It's always difficult to
argue with something that works.''</p><p>The story of Linux and Perceptions is far from over. Only the
basics of our total design plan have been implemented. One of the
fundamental design tenets of our information system is parallel
database concurrency across multiple hosts. Our systems are
designed to be capable of withstanding (and have withstood)
severing of network connections without end-users knowing the event
happened. Additional work with locking and updates across a
wide-area network are a current research interest. An extreme area
of interest and activity is digital document storage and retrieval.
We are secure in meeting future challenges in health care with the
knowledge that we have a stable open operating environment on which
to formulate our information strategies.</p><p>So the story of Linux at the Roger Maris Cancer Center is
really the story and testimony of the success of Linus Torvalds and
the Linux Activist movement. I would hope that everyone in the
movement shares the same sense of accomplishment that I do. It is
with extreme pleasure that I am able to tell visitors that we take
better care of cancer patients because of an experiment in
protected mode programming conducted by a (then) 23-year-old
computer science student from Finland.</p><p>1. StopAlop stands for &ldquo;Stop Alopocea&rdquo; (a medical term for
