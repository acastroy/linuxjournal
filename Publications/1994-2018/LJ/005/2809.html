</p><p>by Eric Youngdale</p><p>The reason that iBCS2 is of interest is that there are a lot
of commercial applications available for both SCO and SVR4 which
people would like to run under Linux. The vendors who write these
applications are often reluctant to port their application to a new
platform such as Linux until they are sure that they will sell a
lot of copies, and so there is no guarantee that a Linux port would
ever be done. By providing iBCS2 compatibility, we suddenly make it
possible to run hundreds of commercial quality applications under
Linux.</p><p>At the time of this writing the iBCS2 code for Linux is still
in ALPHA status. This means that you may experience problems; some
applications will not run or will do the wrong thing. It also means
that you are expected to have some familiarity with patching the
kernel. That being said, there are only a few areas where work is
still being done, and once these are complete the whole thing will
become BETA. This may have already happened by the time you read
this.</p><p>The term iBCS2 simply stands for the &ldquo;Intel Binary
Compatibility Specification 2&rdquo;, and is the name of a standards
document for binary compatibility between different systems running
Unix on Intel 386, 486, and &ldquo;greater&rdquo; CPU's. Some parts of iBCS2
overlap with POSIX, and since Linux is POSIX compliant it means
that there are portions of the emulation which are trivial.
Unfortunately, there are also places where Linux and iBCS2 are
quite different, so iBCS2 emulation is by no means trivial.</p><p>The iBCS2 emulator is mainly designed to be used as a
loadable kernel module. This means that when you boot the kernel
the emulator will not be present in the kernel's address space, so
any attempt to run an iBCS2 application will fail. You must run a
special program to &ldquo;load&rdquo; the emulator into the address space of
the kernel, and once you have done this you will be ready to use
the emulator. If you wish, you can unload the module when you are
through with it to reduce the memory usage, but most people would
not bother to do this.</p><p>To install and use iBCS2 under Linux requires one of several
things. If the distribution of Linux that you are using already
includes iBCS2, then you are in quite a good position. If this is
so, then the chances are that all you will have to do is locate and
load the module, and you will then be ready to run your iBCS2
applications. At the moment, the odds are fairly poor that your
distribution has the iBCS2 patches already applied, so the
remainder of this article will tell you how to get the emulator
built and loaded.</p><p>As a prerequisite, you should be running either a 1.0 or 1.1
series kernel. You should know that the 1.1 kernels are officially
development kernels, and may not be as stable as a 1.0 kernel.
There are also frequent patches to the 1.1 kernels as development
proceeds, so if you are a new user you are probably better off
staying with a 1.0 kernel. If you are running anything older than a
1.0 kernel, you will have no end of difficulties, so your first
step should be to upgrade. If you are running a 1.1 kernel, you
should probably be at the most recent patch-level to minimize
difficulties in compiling and installation.</p><p>Next you should get the source code for the emulator itself.
This can be obtained via anonymous ftp from tsx-11.mit.edu or one
of the many mirror sites of tsx-11, and can be found in the
directory pub/linux/ALPHA/ibcs2. The current version of the
emulator is called ibcs-940610.tar.gz, but by the time you read
this a much newer version should be available. Once you have
obtained this, you need to unpack it. Most people have their kernel
source tree in the directory /usr/src/linux, and the examples I am
about to give assume this.</p><p>To unpack, use the commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/src/linux
gzip -d -c path/ibcs-940610.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</pre><p>where you substitute the actual path of the file obtained by
anonymous ftp for the word &ldquo;path&rdquo;.</p><p>Now you need to see whether there are any patches which need
to be applied to the rest of the kernel. Look in the directory
/usr/src/linux/ibcs/Patches and see what is there. At the time this
was written, there is a patch file for the 1.0 kernels, but there
are no patches required for the 1.1 kernels. If you are running a
1.1 kernel, then skip down to the section on 1.1 kernels. If you
have a 1.0 kernel, then you should do the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/src
patch -p0 &lt; /usr/src/linux/ibcs/Patches/kernel-1.0.pat
cd /usr/src/linux
make config
make dep
</pre><p>When you run &ldquo;make config&rdquo;, it will ask you whether you want
iBCS/ELF/COFF in the kernel. The correct answer is &ldquo;N&rdquo; if you want
to use iBCS2 as a loadable module. If you answer &ldquo;Y&rdquo;, the source
tree will be configured so that the iBCS2 emulator will be linked
directly into the kernel, but this has not been tested in a long
time, and will probably not work very well.</p><p>Now you are ready to actually build the emulator.</p><p>Just type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/src/linux
make
</pre><p>and this will build both the kernel and the iBCS2 emulator.
When it is done, you will have to install the kernel image in the
proper place so that you can boot from it. If you want to boot from
a floppy, then type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make zdisk
</pre><p>and you will have a bootable floppy image. If you are booting
directly from your hard disk, you will have to find the
configuration files for the lilo program, and see where it expects
to find the kernel image. You should copy the zImage file to this
location and run lilo so that this information is properly
recorded. If you are not sure of what you are doing at this step,
please be careful, because you can screw up your system so that it
is not bootable if you do something wrong. Once you have done this,
you will need to reboot so that the patches you applied to the
kernel are in effect on your system.</p><p>If you are running a 1.1 kernel, and there were no patches in
the directory /usr/src/linux/ibcs/Patches that you needed to apply
to your kernel, then you simply need to make sure that you are
running a kernel based upon the source tree into which you have
unpacked the ibcs2 sources. Then you type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/src/linux/ibcs
make
</pre><p>to build the emulator. If you were already running the kernel
that was built from the current /usr/src/linux source tree prior to
adding the iBCS2 stuff, there is no need to reboot. Otherwise you
will need to either make a bootable floppy or copy the zImage file
to the proper location and use lilo to register the new
kernel.</p><p>At this point you are nearly done. There should be a file
called /usr/src/linux/ibcs/iBCS which is the loadable module for
the kernel and it is ready to be loaded. Unless you already have
the &ldquo;insmod&rdquo; program on your system, you will need to obtain the
sources to the modutils package, and you can get this from
tsx-11.mit.edu in pub/linux/sources/sbin. At the time of this
writing, the package is called modutils-0.99.15, and even though it
is old it still works. If there is a newer version, some of the
paths may have changed, so pay close attention. You can unpack this
more or less anywhere, and the following commands illustrate how to
do this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gzip -d -c modutils-0.99.15.tar.gz | tar xvf -
cd modutils-0.99.15
make
make install
</pre><p>You will need to be root to do the &ldquo;make install&rdquo;, because it
needs to copy the executables to a system directory. Once you have
done this, you run the insmod program to load the iBCS2 emulator,
and the following command will do the trick:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/insmod /usr/src/linux/ibcs/iBCS
</pre><p>which should load the iBCS2 emulator into kernel
memory.</p><p>Before you actually try and use iBCS for the first time, you
need to create a few special device files. These are used for
networking applications that come from SCO systems, and they are
used for access to the local X server. The commands you need to run
are:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mknod /dev/socksys c 30 0
ln -s /dev/null /dev/X0R
mknod /dev/spx c 30 1
</pre><p>Now you are truly ready to run iBCS2 applications on your
Linux system; you simply run them in the normal way you would run
any other program on your system.</p><p>In the limited space available to me, I have described how to
get iBCS2 up and running on your system. You may find that there
are problems of one kind or another, and there are text files in
the iBCS2 emulator source tree which you can use to help
troubleshoot the system.</p><p>There are also some elements of emulation which are missing
right now. Support for some types of networking (specifically TLI)
are currently missing, but people are working on this, so hopefully
this will only be a temporary limitation. There is support for
socket-based networking, however. Also, some applications may
require shared libraries of some kind or another. This is one of
the areas where work is still in progress, so your best bet is to
simply see what the status is by asking on the iBCS2 channel or
looking in the directory of the ftp site that you got the emulator
sources from, in a file called libc_s-&lt;date&gt;.tar.gz,
libc_s-940616.tar.gz as of this writing.</p><p>In the end you may wish to obtain a demonstration version of
a package before you spend money to buy the package, and you can
use this to see how well the application will actually work. Some
demonstration versions are available via anonymous ftp; there is a
demonstration version of WordPerfect available from
ftp.wordperfect.com in ftp/unix/demos/sco/sco.z. Also, there is a
list of applications that are known to work in the iBCS2 emulator
source tree, and this is updated every so often.</p><p>If you wish to keep up with the latest developments in iBCS2
emulation, you can join the mailing list that the developers use
for discussions, posting announcements and patches. To join, you
can send a mail message to
<a href="mailto:linux-activists-request@joker.cs.hut.fi">linux-activists-request@joker.cs.hut.fi</a>,
and you should include the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
X-Mn-Admin: JOIN IBCS2
</pre><p>either in the header or as the first line of the message. You
should get a message back to confirm that you are on the list,
which you should save as this also tells you how to get off the
list if you should ever need to do so.</p></div></div>
