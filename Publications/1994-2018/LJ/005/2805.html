    An easy-to-set-up and easy-to-use tool for accessing DOS
    filesystems (and others) from Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd12580.0xe0a2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of Linux's amazing abilities is to
read the filesystems of other operating systems. The most commonly
used filesystem for the PC architecture is the DOS FAT (File
Allocation Table) filesystem. This is the filesystem used by
PC-DOS, MS-DOS, DR-DOS, etc. Linux has two ways to read files that
are in the FAT format. First, you can compile support into the
kernel (at the DOS filesystem prompt in 'make config') and then
mount a drive using the command: mount -t msdos /dev/hda3 /mnt.
This will mount your third partition of the first drive onto the
/mnt directory.
</p><p>Now this is fine and dandy if you have a hard drive, but what
about floppies? If you're anything like me, you don't label your
disks, and important things like next month's article wind up next
to your unused Windows 3.1 install diskettes (now formatted) on a
counter. Mounting and unmounting (with umount) would be a pain in
the tail, because you now have to issue three commands to get a
directory, the mount, the directory, then the umount. Sure you can
put this in a batch file, but mounting takes a while. There has to
be a better way. There is.</p><p>Most of the distributions of Linux come with a package called
mtools. This handy package was designed for Suns and other systems
that did not have easy FAT support. It's system-independent, so you
don't need to go tinkering with your kernel or re-compile it. Just
install the software and go. Most of the commands have names that a
DOS user would know such as del, dir, md, rd, and so on. The
difference is that the mtools have the letter 'm' in front of the
command to specify that it's an mtools command. So 'dir' would be
'mdir', 'del' would be 'mdel', and so on.</p><p>Because mtools does nothing to your kernel, you don't need to
mount and unmount diskettes. Need to copy a file quickly from a
floppy? Just use 'mcopy'. The box at left lists the available
mtools commands and their respective DOS counterparts. Two commands
that do not have real DOS counterparts are mread and mwrite. These
two commands are defined as low level reads or writes. Mread will
read only from a FAT filesystem to a Linux file, and mwrite will
write only from a Linux file to a FAT filesystem. You may want to
use mread and mwrite if you are in a multi-user setup and you want
some people to be able to only read FAT filesystems, and others to
only write to them. Remember that the FAT filesystem has no user
ownership and all files can be modified if users have access to
mtools. Be sure to keep this in mind if you plan on having multiple
users.</p><p>In order to use mtools properly, you must have a /etc/mtools
file set up. To do that, you have to know how your floppy drives
are seen by Linux. As I mentioned in a previous article, all of
your physical devices such as your modem, monitor, printer, and
sound card, are listed as special files in the /dev directory. The
same is true of your drives. There are a list of files in the /dev
directory that start with fd0 or fd1 of the form:</p><p>/dev/fdXYNNNNwhereX 0 - First floppy drive (A)1 - Second
floppy drive (B)Y d - low density 5.25"D - low density 3.5"h - high
density 5.25"H - high density 3.5"NNNN - Three or four digit number
listing the number of 1K blocks on that drive. A high density 5.25"
can have 360, 720, or 1200 while a high density 3.5" can have 360,
720, and 1440. Low density 5.25" is 360, and low density 3.5" has
360 and 720.</p><p>This means about 18 files in the /dev directory just for
floppy drives. Luckily, you won't need to remember these
combinations except for special circumstances.</p><p>Why? Because two additional files, /dev/fd0 and /dev/fd1 are
set up as auto-sensing devices. When Linux boots up, it checks your
system setup (the BIOS) for what floppy drives you have. The BIOS
then tells the kernel what floppy drives you have, what size they
are (5.25" or 3.5") and if they are high-density or low-density. In
addition, when you insert a pre-formatted disk in the drive, Linux
can determine if you have a high-density or low-density disk. So
you can mount a low density floppy in a high density drive by just
using 'mount -t msdos /dev/fd1 /mnt'.</p><p>Okay, now back to mtools and /etc/mtools.</p><p>An entry in /etc/mtools looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
d &lt;device&gt; &lt;fat&gt; &lt;tracks&gt; &lt;heads&gt;
&lt;sectors&gt;
</pre><p>Where:</p><p>d Drive letter you want to use. Yes, you can assign the first
floppy drive to 'Q:' like you always wanted. Just be sure that your
entry does not have the ':' in it. Just the drive letter.</p><p>device In most cases, this will be the /dev entry that you
want to use. This can be /dev/fd0, /dev/hda1, or /dev/sda1 (for you
SCSI people).</p><p>fat Size of the FAT table. Floppy drives and hard drive
partitions have a size of 12, while large hard drive partitions
have a size of 16. If you're unsure about your hard drive setting,
use the 'fdisk -l' command which lists all of the partitions on all
of your hard drives whether they are IDE or SCSI. DOS drives should
say either 'DOS 12-bit &lt;32M' or 'DOS 16-bit &gt;=32M' Whatever
is before the '-bit' is what you want for &lt;fat&gt;.</p><p>If you have a hard drive, or are using /dev/fd0 or /dev/fd1
as a device for an entry, you may fill in the rest as 0. This tells
mtools to ask the kernel to find out. For other entries, you'll
need to specify:</p><p>tracks Number of tracks on the drive. High density have 80
tracks while low density has 40.</p><p>heads Number of heads. Always 2 unless you have a really old
drive. Like one of those drives where you have to flip the diskette
over to read the second side.</p><p>sectors Number of sectors for the disk. 3.5 inch disks have
18 and 5.25 inch have 15.</p><p>The only time you would want to specify a drive using the
tracks, heads or sectors is when you would want to format a disk.
Set up the drives you would most want to format. For me, this is my
high density 3.5 inch drive, so my entry would look like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
e /dev/fd0H1440 12 80 2 18
</pre><p>I have my A through D drives set up as my two floppy drives
and two DOS hard drives. The helps me avoid confusion while mucking
with my drives.</p><p>Once you have your /etc/mtools file set up, save it and try
accessing the drives you just set up. Try 'mdir c:' to see if it
works. If you get a directory, it's working. If you get a 'Probable
non-DOS disk' or a similar error message, you may be looking at the
wrong partition. Edit your /etc/mtools file again and find the
correct partition with the 'fdisk -l' command. Once you have all
your drives set up, you can have fun with all the mtools
commands.</p><p>Now on to formatting floppy disks. Now that you have
/etc/mtools set up, this is a bit easier to do. If you have a new
disk, you'll need to low-level format the diskette before you can
put a DOS FAT filesystem on it. Both of these steps are done by the
DOS format command, but we have to do it in two steps (unless you
make a shell script). If all of your diskettes are in DOS FAT
format, you can skip the next paragraph and find out how to do
quick formats the mtools way. If your disks are in tar format or
have been used as Linux boot disks, you shouldn't have to low-level
format them, because mformat is more flexible than DOS's &ldquo;format
/q&rdquo; command.</p><p>First is the low-level formatting. This is done with the
fdformat command. The fdformat command uses as its option the
device file you used earlier to define the</p><p>device in /etc/mtools. For example, the high density 3.5"
disk you would put in drive 'A' is /dev/fd0H1440. So, to format
that disk would be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
fdformat /dev/fd0H1440
</pre><p>You should see a little message saying that it has 80 tracks,
18 sectors per track, total 1440KB. You should then see it
formatting, then verifying the diskette. Once this is done, you can
lay down a DOS FAT filesystem.</p><p>To install the FAT filesystem, the mformat utility is used.
It will only accept a drive letter, which is why you wanted
different drive types set up in /etc/mtools. Since I had my high
density 3.5" drive set up as drive E, I can just type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mformat e
</pre><p>and my diskette will now be in DOS FAT format. Since this
merely lays down a new FAT filesystem and root directory, it is
comparable to quick-formatting programs under DOS like 'format /q'.
If you get an error or the disk is unreadable with mdir, go back
and low-level format the diskette, then re-format.</p><p>Once you have the FAT filesystem on the disk, it is
compatable with mtools, native DOS, and can be mounted from the
Linux kernel. It is as if you formatted it under DOS.</p><p>You can also place any supported Linux filesystem on the
diskette like ext2fs, xiafs and extfs. Merely replace the mformat
command with the command used to make that particular filesystem,
such as mke2fs. You too can have your own library of Extended
File-system diskettes, each 1.4MB big.</p><p>Using mtools will help you keep some of your DOS
compatability, and it's easy to setup and use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd12580.0xe0af50"></a>Getting mtools</h2></div></div><p>If your distribution did not come with mtools, or if you
would like to get mtools for some other machine, you can use
anonymous ftp to prep.ai.mit.edu or some mirror site (postings in
gnu.announce almost always include a long list of mirror sites),
set binary mode, cd to /pub/gnu, and get mtools-2.0.7.tar.gz. It
should compile under Linux with no problems.
