psychic landscape described in the recent book of the same name by
Douglas Rushkoff, you'd do well to prepare yourself with a trip
through his pages. But you wouldn't have much to guide you when you
were done; vague references to various locales in and around San
Francisco and a strong sense of an extended group of people with a
decidedly different take on life.
</p><p>Here's a sample (from the chapter called &ldquo;Gardners Ov Thee
Abyss''):</p><p>The Temple Ov Psychick Youth is a nett-work for the
dissemination of majick (their spellings) through the culture for
the purpose of human emancipation. TOPY (rhymes with soapy) began
as a fan club and ideological forum for Genesis P. Orridge, founder
of industrial band Throbbing Gristle and its house spin-off Psychic
TV, but soon developed into a massive cultish web of majick
practitioners and datasphere enthusiasts. They are the most severe
example of technopaganism....</p><p>Familiar figures (Timothy O'Leary, Mitch Kapor) make guest
appearances in Cyberia. Familiar technologies (discos, BBSs) do as
well. The author gamely attempts to bridge the gaps between the
characters he brings to life in his diary of exploration and the
rest of us, the imagined readers of his book. But in the end
Cyberia comes up more a collection of in-your-face attitudes than a
place; more a self-absorbed and self-reverential crowd slinging
buzz words and recreational drugs than a representation of the
forces that could (on the last page) &rdquo;slowly pull our society; even
our world; past the event horizon of the great attractor at the end
of time''.</p><p>If, on the other hand, you wanted to take a tour of
cyberspace, as it exists today and is evolving on the anarchic
Internet, you'd do well to prepare yourself with a trip through the
pages of Ed Krol's The Whole Internet User's Guide and Catalog.
There are literally dozens of books that cover similar ground on
the shelves of any well-stocked bookstore. It's hard to imagine,
though, one that would be of more general use to anyone familiar
with a desktop computer who needed the keys to unlock the mysteries
of exploring the 'net.</p><p>This is the second edition of a work that (by its publisher's
count) sold a quarter of a million copies in the first edition.
That popularity is, to my taste, well deserved. This is a book that
can lead you step-by-step through first-time use of some very
powerful, and very frustrating, tools. And it's a book you can
return to time and again for useful tips as your knowledge grows
and your sense of the possible expands. The detailed instructions
on the major tools; ftp, mail, newsreaders, gopher, WAIS and WWW;
go well beyond the basics without trying to substitute for a manual
page or technical compendium. Yet they always start from a clear
vision of what an explorer will need to master the tools
personally, to enjoy creative use in place of
keystroke-by-keystroke repetition.</p><p>This is not, though, the book I'd choose as a gift for
someone newly venturing alone onto this network of interconnected
computers. The goal of serving the needs and interests of people as
they grow in their use of the 'net is well met. But it's met by
saying so much that any true newcomer can hardly avoid being
overwhelmed.</p><p>Throughout, though, Krol adopts a breezy, reassuring tone
that seems directed at newcomers. It occasionally leads to a
heartiness that strikes a false note with me.... &ldquo;The commands you
use may be slightly different, to make them more like a 'normal'
command on your computer system, but when and why you use which
command will remain the same.'' Only if it works! It doesn't take
too long to learn that one machine's &rdquo;slightly&ldquo; is another's
light-year. Keeping the reader informed (as he does) when upper vs.
lower case makes a difference is a step in the right direction. But
there are just too many places on the 'net where getting something
&rdquo;slightly&ldquo; wrong means getting nothing at all. A brief discussion
of strategies to employ in such cases wouldn't be out of
place.</p><p>In general, this book is pitched toward the user on a campus
or in a large organization where there are sources for day-to-day
tech support available for the asking. He encourages his readers to
&rdquo;ask the systems administrator&ldquo; about intractable problems. Little
guidance is provided for people on community systems or low-cost
Unix providers, such as searching for on-line help in the form of
manual pages or FAQ files for the quirks that every 'net cruiser
comes to know and love, or even bravely asking the question in
newsgroups where there may be solace for the baffled.</p><p>The great strength of this book is opening up practical use
of the 'net as a source of information for research or personal
interests. Seventy-two pages at the back list resource after
resource for exploring topics broad and arcane. The index is
divided into two parts; one &rdquo;technical'', the other a &ldquo;catalog&rdquo; of
gopher sites to visit and files to transfer.</p><p>It disappoints me, though, that there is so little
recognition of the possibility that a new sort of community is
growing up in cyberspace, where world-circling friendships and
alliances can be formed for all manner of purposes unrelated to the
location of data or capture of information. The catalog cites
&ldquo;December's Guide to Internet Resources&rdquo; (anonymous ftp to
ftp.rpi.edu, cd pub/communications) without shedding much light on
the fascinations of computer-mediated communications. IRC gets four
not very informative pages; MUDs two. The possibility of using the
MUD metaphor to link people for real-world, not fantasy, tasks gets
one cryptic sentence about &ldquo;MOO-style&rdquo; conferencing tools.</p><p>And while I'm on the subject of things being cryptic, let me
carp for a moment about cross-references. There are important terms
in the text that don't show up in the index (&ldquo;terminal
specification&rdquo;) or in the glossary (&ldquo;daemon&rdquo; and &ldquo;escape&rdquo;). Some
subjects are mentioned once and carefully explained. Others pop up
time and again (&ldquo;regular expressions&rdquo;) but are never addressed.
There's a seven-page &ldquo;Unix Primer&rdquo; (very useful) in Appendix D. But
these pages weren't included in the Technical Index, so the only
reference to &ldquo;grep&rdquo; (for example) sends the reader to a footnote
which advises learning more about Unix, not to the brief and
helpful explanation of this command which is provided in Appendix
D.</p><p>In a first edition, these missed opportunities might be
expected. After 250,000 copies have been printed, it should have
been possible to find, and deal with, most of them.</p><p>Carping aside, Ed Krol's The Whole Internet has great
strengths. Strengths which justify its position as a pre- eminent
guide for touring the Internet. Not the least are the numerous
full-text examples of terminal sessions, where every keystroke is
shown and many are explained. These examples make this book
particularly useful for anyone who has an occasional reason to pick
up a new tool and visit an unfamiliar part of the 'net. If you
anticipate having that need, this tested and updated classic will
be a good companion to have at your side on the journey.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Cyberia: Life in the Trenches of
