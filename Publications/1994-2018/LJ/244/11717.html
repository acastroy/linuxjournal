Programming always has been that &ldquo;thing&rdquo; people did that I never
understood. You've heard me lament about my lack of programming skills
through
the years, and honestly, I never thought I'd need to learn. Then along came
the DevOps mentality, and I started introducing programmatic ways of managing
my system administration world. And you know what? Programming is pretty
awesome.
</p><p>
Reuven M. Lerner starts off the programming issue with a great article on
how to begin in the Web development field. If you're like me, and have been ushered into
the programmer's world blindfolded and scared, Reuven has a great
starting point for you. Dave Taylor also teaches us programming as he
continues his lessons on scripting dates and counting days. For some
reason, shell scripting doesn't seem like programming, and I'm far more
comfortable doing it. If that sounds silly, that's because it is! Shell
scripting is programming, and if you've ever created sysadmin scripts or
even written batch files in Windows, your programming skills are better
than you think.

Kyle Rankin addresses an issue this month that can be really frustrating if
you're automating a cloud environment. If you spin up a server that gets
assigned a random IP address, how do you address it from the rest of your
infrastructure? He shows us his method of dealing with that scenario and
teaches us about DHCP along the way.
</p><p>
I decided to continue our summer vacation a bit with my Open-Source
Classroom column and talk about recreation. Last month, I covered
health-related technology, and so this month, I'm discussing 
mental-health-related technology&mdash;namely, games, TV, books and music. Next
month, will be all command line and learning, but here I focus on
enjoying the technology that is supposed to make our lives so much easier!
</p><p>
Next up is Richard Delaney. If you've ever tried to automate your
infrastructure with something like Chef or Puppet, you know that spinning
up VMs on demand can be challenging. With Vagrant, creating a brand-new
virtual machine is a simple one-liner. It supports multiple virtualization
platforms, multiple host OSes and abstracts the underlying process.
Richard walks through using Vagrant in your VM infrastructure.

Mihalis Tsoukalos dives deep into programming as he shows how to create
three-dimensional graphics with OpenGL. While creating a cube on the screen
isn't exactly a contender for Game of the Year, the process is an
invaluable building &ldquo;block&rdquo; for developing with OpenGL. If you want to
manipulate graphics in your applications, Mihalis' article is a must-read.

As data centers grow, and IT budgets shrink, managing massive numbers of
systems gets overwhelming quickly. In fact, gone are the days when a crusty
old system administrator (ahem, me) can configure all the servers one by
one and maintain them all him or herself. Mark Burgess describes 
Promise Theory, which is a framework on which to design and configure
massive distributed systems. If you need to re-invent the way your
data center works, Promise Theory is a great way to think.

Linux traditionally has been so flexible that it often is considered a
one-size-fits-all solution to technology needs. For many use cases, that's
still true. If your organization needs a custom Linux distribution or
needs to develop something slightly different from what a mainstream distro
offers, that flexibility proves to be malleable as well. David Brown
walks through customizing a Linux operating system to fit specific
needs, including custom development and system modifications. Rather than
create a new 'buntu variant, David shows how to tweak existing distros
to meet your needs.
</p><p>
I'll admit, programming still is scary territory for some of us, myself
included. In this issue, we ease into some of the &ldquo;development
mindset&rdquo;
where we are no longer just consumers, but creators. The beauty of open
source is that we get to build on the brilliance of others, and knowledge
is freely shared, not guarded like a secret.
</p><p>
We've also included a plethora of non-development content this month.
Whether you're a sysadmin, a Linux enthusiast or just someone looking to
play some cool games, the August issue aims to please. We hope you enjoy
