I Must Be an Extremist</h4><p>
Wow&mdash;you should have had the NSA declare <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> an extremist
organization months ago.
</p><p>
I had, sadly, let my subscription expire a few months ago. However, after
reading that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> and its readers are
considered &ldquo;extremists&rdquo; by
the NSA, I have resubscribed for two years with automatic renewal after that.
</p><p>
Take <span   class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> NSA!
</p><p>
And, thanks also for a great publication. Keep those extremist articles
about privacy and freedom coming.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
David Both  <br><br>
</p><p>
Thanks David. I have to admit, when I first heard of the XKEYSCORE/NSA stuff, 
I went to our Web site to see what on earth might have attracted attention.
The first thing I saw was a video still shot of me doing the issue intro with 
a really goofy look on my face. &ldquo;This is the face of terror&rdquo;, I said to my
wife, who replied with something like, &ldquo;we're all doomed.&rdquo;
</p><p>
We're happy to have you as a subscriber, and we'll try to continue with our
extremist ways&mdash;whatever that might mean!&mdash;Shawn Powers
</p><a name="N0x1a30580.0x1b28778"></a><h4 class="title"><a name="N0x1a30580.0x1b28778"></a>
Extremists?
</h4><p>
A glance at the XKEYSCORE snippet shows &ldquo;These variables define terms and
websites relating to the TAILs (The AmnesicIncognito Live System) software
program, a comsec mechanism advocated by extremists on extremist
forums.&rdquo;,
followed by:

<pre     class="programlisting">
"$TAILS_terms=word('tails' or 'Amnesiac Incognito 
 &#8618;Live System') and word('linux' or ' USB ' 
 &#8618;or ' CD ' or 'secure desktop' or ' IRC ' or
 &#8618;'truecrypt' or ' tor ');
$TAILS_websites=('tails.boum.org/') or
('linuxjournal.com/content/linux*');"
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that it is quite likely that extremist forums do advocate use of Tor
and TAILs, as do most comsec concerned folks, such as forensic specialists
and malware investigators, and perhaps, Three Letter Agencies. Since
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> is a publicly available and informative forum on Linux items of
interest, such as Tor and TAILs, I would suggest that the proximity of
&ldquo;extremists on extremist forums&rdquo; to
&ldquo;linuxjournal.com/content/linux&rdquo; does not associate
&ldquo;linuxjournal&rdquo; with &ldquo;extremist forums&rdquo;. However, your point is
that access to your Web site in conjunction with the Tor or TAILs query may
put one on a &ldquo;watch list&rdquo; for further scrutiny&mdash;well, given the
forensic and malware workload these days, that will push the
noise-to-signal ratio up quite a bit (no pun intended). Do you think
DistroWatch is somewhere on the list?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Arnold Hayes  <br><br>
</p><p>
It's so crazy, it's really hard to tell what the exact reason or triggers we might
be associated with are. The concept at all is just...crazy. I can't think of a 
better word. The Linux community and, in kind, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> community are
obviously advocates of freedom, but when standing for the very things that
make America what it is marks us for scrutiny? Again, crazy.&mdash;Shawn
Powers

No More Letters in the Magazine?</h4><p>
I am disappointed that the Letters portion has moved to the Web site
instead of being printed in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>. I read
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> off-line with my
Kindle and look forward to the Letters every issue. Now that it's no
longer there, I have to view it on my desktop, which defeats the purpose.
Trying out the Letters link on my Kindle when I'm on-line does not provide
me with content that is easy to read on the device.
</p><p>
I remember this with paper magazines of old, where they provided &ldquo;extra
content&rdquo; on the Web. I rarely visited them. And if I wanted to, the
magazine often wasn't
with me anymore, and I'd forget the link.
</p><p>
Granted, I can view <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> on my Nexus 10, or my MacBook, but nothing provides
the pleasure of reading that is E Ink.
</p><p>
Also, looking at the link <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/letters" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/letters</a>, how would
I know what was the response to what particular issue?
</p><p>
I propose an alternative, since you wanted to allow for comments: publish
the Letters to the Editor in the magazine, with the replies if any, then
also provide a permalink to the letter on the Web. This will:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Allow me to read while in a relaxed mood, either the PDF, .epub or .mobi
versions, without the need to switch context and jump to the Web (and from
there, go down the rabbit hole of surfing).
</p></li><li><p>
If I'm passionate about a letter, I can click on the link to see if there
are more responses.
</p></li><li><p>
I can comment on my thoughts, if I have any on the particular topic.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
With the letters still in my head, I can refer to the actual letter in
question in <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> and click on the link for immediate gratification.
</p><p>
Since <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> is an electronically delivered magazine, you do have possibilities
that are within your power to manipulate to make the user's experience
better than what paper publications can do.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Wari Wahnab  <br><br>
</p><p>
Thank you for the input, Wari. We did shift the Letters out of last issue,
but we've included them back in this one because of letters like yours. As you mention, we're trying to
make the Letters something that is interactive in a little more timely
manner
than once a month. We'll keep tweaking how we do things, and hopefully we'll
find a good solution. Your input is invaluable, because otherwise we're
just guessing!&mdash;Shawn Powers

I See the NSA Is Labeling <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> as an Extremist Web Site</h4><p>
If <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> is an American-based company with servers located inside
America's borders, I'm sure the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF,
<a href="https://www.eff.org" target="_self">https://www.eff.org</a>) and/or
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU, <a href="https://www.aclu.org" target="_self">https://www.aclu.org</a>) would be happy to litigate a case on
your behalf against the NSA, for free.
</p><p>
Warrantless spying on an American journal and its users is clearly a
violation of the first and fourth constitutional Amendments&mdash;freedom of speech,
association and warrantless surveillance.
</p><p>
The lawsuit would be great publicity for your magazine. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> vs. NSA
would be plastered on the front pages of every major news organization
across the world.
</p><p>
I believe having a copy of the XKEYSCORE source code specifically listing
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> as a &ldquo;target&rdquo; selector would give your lawsuit plenty of
standing for a case against the NSA.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Ralf   <br><br>
</p><p>
Thank you, Ralf. As of this response, we're still just reeling a bit from the
notion that our readers, and most likely our staff, are being monitored and/or
spied on. While we do have an international readership, we are indeed an entirely
US-based magazine. The worrisome part is, if <span   class="emphasis"><em>we</em></span> are targeted, I can only imagine
who else must be! Scary stuff.&mdash;Shawn Powers

Days Between Dates Script</h4><p>
Regarding Dave Taylor's &ldquo;Days Between Dates?&rdquo; article in the
July 2014 issue:


<pre     class="programlisting">
grep '29' =&gt; Yes, 1729 was a leapyear, so February 29, 
 1729 is a valid date.
grep ' 29' =&gt; Oops, 1729 wasn't a leapyear, so February 
 only had 28 days.
</pre>

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Jyrki Kajala  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span> You're right, the
addition of a leading space does make this invocation more accurate! This
problem will, of course, show up any time there's a &ldquo;29&rdquo; in the
year, including in 2029, by which time we'll likely have a different
way of figuring out whether it's a leap year. &ldquo;Siri? Is this a leap
year?&rdquo; &ldquo;Jyrki, you asked me that 4,503,343 milliseconds ago. Why
are you asking me again? Have you become obsolete?&rdquo;
&ldquo;AUuuugggghhhh!&rdquo;

More on the Days Between Dates Script</h4><p>
In the sidebar in Dave Taylor's &ldquo;Days Between Dates?&rdquo; article
in the July 2014 issue, he states that <tt  >date</tt> doesn't work for dates before 1970.
</p><p>
If you are using the GNU corelib date utility, this is incorrect:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ date +%s '1776-1-1'
-6122019600

$ date -d '@-6122019600'
Mon Jan  1 00:00:00 MST 1776
</pre>
</p><p>
Also, <tt  >date</tt> handles some pretty free-form date
entries, although the date has
to be a complete date&mdash;no attempts with only a month and year, for example.
</p><p>
On a separate note, <tt  >date +%j -d 'Dec 31, $year'</tt> will give you either 365 or
366, depending on whether or not it's a leap year. I'm not sure how it
handles years in which there were less than 365 days. I suspect it just
treats all dates as Gregorian.


<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Alan Young  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span>
Thanks for the helpful message. As an old-school Linux and UNIX guy,
negative seconds-since-epoch bugs me, but that's okay, because your
observation that the <tt  >%j day-of-the-year</tt> value easily can be used to test
for leap year is terrific and one I'm going to borrow!

Removing Letters to the Editor from the Digital Magazine</h4><p>
I was surprised to find that you are no longer including the Letters to
the Editor section in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> digital magazine (as of the July 2014
issue). Since your magazine has gone digital-only, I find that I now read
it cover to cover (mostly), and I particularly enjoyed the give and take
that occurs between the readers and the article writers in the Letters
section.
</p><p>
I realize that I can still read this interchange on-line, but doing so adds
a little more &ldquo;friction&rdquo; to the process and fails to inform me when there
is feedback on the various topics.
</p><p>
Since <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> is now available only in digital
formats (PDF, .epub and so on), it seems that removing the Letters section
does not result in much of a
cost-savings (possibly a small savings in page layout/markup/design). Do
you have a more compelling reason for this change?
</p><p>
If you feel that this must be a permanent change, perhaps you could include
a sidebar listing the topics of letters received (with links to enable
accessing them on-line). 
</p><p>
I also miss the &ldquo;Photo of the Month&rdquo;, although I realize you may not
always have a photo to share with us every month.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Gerald   <br><br>
</p><p>
Thanks Gerald!
Yes, we shook things up a bit taking out the Letters to the Editor. They're (obviously)
back this month. We'll eventually find the perfect mix of interactivity and
convenience. Last month, was our first step toward that goal. Thank you for 
letting us know your thoughts; it really helps us shape the future! We'll
continue having Photo of the Month as well, as long as we receive good
submissions, so please send your Linux-related photos to
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>.&mdash;Shawn Powers

Keep Up the Great Work!</h4><p>
I just subscribed to <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> two months ago, and I love it! I have been involved
with computers and electronics since I was ten years old when I started with
the Apple IIE. I also love high-power rocketry! I plan on building a Linux
computer to control a high-power rocket I plan on doing for Level 2 NAR
certification soon. Also, I love health and fitness, as I was a personal
trainer for nine years. Now I train and workout hard-core for myself and train
clients part time. I am a technology and fitness freak! I love it!
</p><p>
I love the PDF format of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, as this is way of the
future, since we can
eliminate paper clutter and have links to click on when we want more
information
on details. I love it! I have tons of paper books and old magazines that I want
to convert to PDF. I started doing it myself with a good Fujitsu
scanner, but I have so many, I want to hire someone or some company to scan
most of these books for me.
</p><p>
Keep up all your amazing content in the PDF format!

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Christian Lombardo  <br><br>
</p><p>
Welcome aboard, Christian!
I'm still struggling with my fitness routine. The diet is going well (40 pounds
lost as of today, July 5th), but getting motivated to exercise is harder. I 
still try to walk as much as possible, but I'd like to be a runner someday.
</p><p>
Thanks for sharing your appreciation for the digital publication. The feelings
on that subject vary widely from user to user. Thankfully, I think the tablet/reader 
market has matured to the point where reading digitally is really a
painless experience.&mdash;Shawn Powers
