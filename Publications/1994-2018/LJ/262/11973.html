<tt  >getopt</tt>&mdash;the right way to parse starting arguments in your shell script.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1231580.0x1329408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my last article, I went interstellar and created a multi-planet time
translator, allowing you to learn just how old you'd be if you lived
on Saturn or Pluto. So in this article, I want to head back to a more fundamental
aspect of shell scripting: working with command arguments.
</p><p>
I suspect that most shell scripts go through an evolution with their
command flags, actually starting out with none, then maybe one or two
parsed in a sloppy fashion, finally upgraded to a proper implementation of
<tt  >getopt</tt>, and then, perhaps, even being completely rewritten as a C++ or Ruby
program as the complexity keeps inexorably increasing.
</p><p>
The really easy way to parse a starting flag, of course, is just to use a
conditional statement:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ "$1" = "-a" ]; then
  flaga=1
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
There are a couple problems with this approach, however, not the least
of which is that it ends up taking a fair amount of space in the code.
Because to be proper, the full sequence also would include <tt  >flaga=0</tt> before
the conditional, because (repeat after me) you never can assume that the
shell will correctly instantiate the value of a newly defined variable.
</p><p>
The other problem is that after this code sequence, the command parameters
are out of sync: <tt  >$1</tt> is still either possibly the starting flag value
(<tt  >-a</tt>) or another argument or value that the user has specified.
</p><p>
To make this a bit more logical, let's imagine a shell script
that's a wrapper to something like the terrific <tt  >curl</tt>: give
it a URL, and it'll grab that content and save it to the local
directory as a file. Add the imagined <tt  >-a</tt> flag, and it'll also
include progress information.
So, a typical usage might look like this:
  
<pre     class="programlisting">
getpage.sh -a http://www.linuxjournal.com/index.html
</pre>
</p><p>
In this situation, a number of command parameter variables are going to be
instantiated as the shell script is invoked, notably <tt  >$# = 2</tt>,
<tt  >$0 =
getpage.sh</tt>, <tt  >$1 = -a</tt> and <tt  >$2 =
http://www.linuxjournal.com/index.html</tt>.
</p><p>
Where I always get tripped up is that <tt  >$#</tt> is the number of arguments, not
the total number of words in the command. Therefore, if this script is
invoked without any arguments at all, <tt  >$#</tt> seems like it should be 1 (what
about the command name?), but actually it's 0.
</p><p>
This goes back to the dawn of UNIX development actually, and it's known as
the &ldquo;0 index problem&rdquo;. In arrays, the first value is referenced as
being in slot 0, or array[0]. For some developers, that makes complete
sense, and for others, it can be confusing. Indeed, I've seen C
programs where the writer ignores the first slot entirely and indexes starting at
1, not 0.
</p><p>
With that in mind, after the conditional has been used to check for the
<tt  >-a</tt> flag in the first variable space ($1), what really needs to
happen is that all the positional variables above this one (for example, $2, $3 and so on)
need to shift down a spot. Ideally, after the conditional, $1
contains the URL value regardless of whether the starting flag was
specified.
</p><p>
That way, the next statement block in the script safely can assume that $1
will be the URL and not have to test redundantly to see if it's still
<tt  >-a</tt>.
</p><p>
This is done with the <tt  >shift</tt> command, and so, here's the proper way to
test conditionally for an optional variable in a shell script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
flaga=0
if [ "$1" = "-a" ]; then
  flaga=1
  shift
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
That works exactly as you'd hope, but leads to the next question: what
happens if the flag has an optional value that the user can specify? In
the case of this curl script, perhaps the flag is something like -o output
file.
</p><p>
That's actually an easy addition to the above code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
outputspecified=0
if [ "$1" = "-o" ]; then
  outputspecified=1
  outputfilename="$2"
  shift 2
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, <tt  >shift</tt> takes a single numeric argument that reflects how
many slots you want to have everything cascade. It's easy to see if
you consider the positional values before and after the above code block:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh getpage.sh -0 test.html SomeURL
$# = 3
$1 = -a
$2 = test.html
$3 = SomeURL
-----
$# = 1
$1 = SomeURL
$2 =
$3 =
</pre>
</p><p>
Initially, all three positional variables are set, and the arg count ($#)
is 3, as makes sense given the command invocation. But after the
<tt  >shift 2</tt>, everything's moved down two slots, and the arg count
also is decremented two, as you can see above.
</p><p>
Now, what if your development of the script hits a juncture where you
realize that it'd be useful to have three different starting
arguments, one of which indeed takes an argument?

Dealing with Lots of Starting Flags</h2></div></div><p>
Even two flags can be a pain, because it'd be terrible code that would
force the user to specify them in order, but without that, -a, -c and -o
could require you to test for all three, parse and shift, then test for all
three again, parse and shift, then test for all three one more time. That would be a
nightmare, and I haven't even mentioned how those pesky users have a
tendency to combine flags too, so would your script properly parse <tt  >-ac
-o</tt>
or <tt  >-oc -a</tt> too?
</p><p>
Enter <tt  >getopt</tt>.
</p><p>
The <tt  >getopt</tt> command is going to become your best friend if you're
building complex user-facing scripts, no question. It basically works by
extracting all the optional flags and parameters, then lets you parse
through them in a uniform manner.
</p><p>
The standard usage is to break down combined args with an invocation of
<tt  >getopt</tt>, then use the <tt  >set</tt> command to replace the existing starting flags
with the new, neater args, then run through a loop, parsing them one by
one.
</p><p>
Yes, this is easier just to demonstrate, so let me show you the command
flag parsing segment from a different production script. This particular
command has three possible starting flags, <tt  >-n</tt>,
<tt  >-p</tt> and <tt  >-t</tt>.
</p><p>
The first step in the script is to have <tt  >getopt</tt> normalize whatever the
user has specified:

<pre     class="programlisting">
args=$(getopt np:t $*)
</pre>
</p><p>
Comparing this statement with the usage error below, you can see that arg
1 to <tt  >getopt</tt> is a list of all acceptable flags, with : denoting
those flags that have a required additional argument if the flag is
specified&mdash;easy enough.
</p><p>
Now the status variable <tt  >$?</tt> can be tested: if it's non-zero, there was
an error in parsing the flags, and in most scripts, it's time to fail
out with a usage statement:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $? != 0] ; then
  echo \
    "Usage: $(basename $0) {-p SFX} {-n} {-t} PTN NEWPTN"
  echo "    -n   sequentially number matching files"
  echo "    -p   use specified suffix SFX for filenames"
  echo "    -t   test only - don't execute resultant cmds"
  exit 0
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll often see scripts that have the usage sequence pushed into a
separate function to keep the code clean. Also, note the use of <tt  >$(basename
$0)</tt> in the first echo. That's a handy trick to compensate for the fact
that most of the time <tt  >$0</tt> is going to be the full name of the
script,
including path. So tapping basename is just for aesthetics!
</p><p>
Finally, the statement that does the real work:

<pre     class="programlisting">
set -- $args
</pre>
</p><p>
Now all the positional parameters are neatly organized and ready to parse,
something that's traditionally done with a case statement wrapped in a
for loop (no difference from an enigma wrapped in a dilemma, of course).
It looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for i
do
  case "$i"
  in
   -n ) renumber=1 ; shift ;;
   -p ) fixpng=1   ; sfx=$2 ; shift 2 ;;
   -t ) doit=0     ; shift ;;
 esac
done
</pre>
</p><p>
I have a particular style with the semicolons in my case statements,
mostly just to ensure that I use the needed <tt  >;;</tt> sequence to terminate each
of the individual conditionals, but otherwise, it should be easy to
understand.
</p><p>
The only thing missing from this code fragment is something I alluded to
earlier. What is it?
</p><p>
And, that's it for this article. Now, go back to your latest shell script,
and just for practice, go ahead and add some optional starting flags and
parse them with <tt  >getopt</tt>.
