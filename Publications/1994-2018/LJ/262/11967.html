Interview with Katerina Barone-Adesi about developing with the Snabb
Switch network toolkit, working outside the Linux kernel for cleaner
code and faster throughput.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2019580.0x2111358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Recently, I had the pleasure of sitting down with Katerina Barone-Adesi,
a developer from the Snabb Switch community to talk about Snabb
Switch, writing network infrastructure code and more. In case you
aren't familiar with Snabb Switch, it is described in its README as &ldquo;a
simple and fast packet networking toolkit&rdquo;. The thing that caught my
attention was Snabb Switch's unusual architecture: it's small and fast,
but written largely in LuaJIt, which I didn't expect. It circumvents the
kernel almost entirely, preferring to interface directly with network
hardware and network code that is slower than that in Snabb Switch.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SS:</b></span> Can you give me some examples of what Snabb Switch can be used for?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>KB:</b></span> Snabb should be interesting to anyone who wants to do high-speed
networking with the flexibility of writing software and seriously needs
to consider several gigabits a second or more of traffic. Secondarily,
it is interesting to hobbyists and researchers. Alexander Gall, at SWITCH,
wrote an L2VPN on Snabb, because the features he wanted were not available
elsewhere. It is a really powerful tool for individuals and small teams
who need to do unusual or new things with networks.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SS:</b></span> So, how did Snabb Switch get started?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>KB:</b></span> Snabb was started by Luke Gorrie, who has a fairly deep
background in networking, along with a professional history using
Smalltalk, Forth, etc. He was influenced by some of Alan Kay's ideas about
building small, comprehensible systems that individuals can understand&mdash;and also by
the desire to do flexible, high-performance software-defined
networking on commodity x86 hardware.
</p><p>
It started with a code budget&mdash;the binary should fit on a floppy,
compile in less than a second (and less than a minute including dependencies),
and be less than 10,000 lines of code. It has grown a bit beyond that.
Essentially, it lets people do more or less line speed networking using
10 gigabit cards, on a single core, without the overhead of using the
kernel. The kernel is involved peripherally (for instance, it uses
hugepage support), but Snabb implements its own drivers, and the cards
it is handling are not managed by the kernel.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SS:</b></span> A lot of what's out there in this space today is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>big</em></span>...when you're
introducing people to these tools (either building them or using them)
do they usually get where you're going right away? If not, what are
the parts that are hardest for them to wrap their heads around?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>KB:</b></span> I would say the biggest initial hurdle, assuming some knowledge
of networking, is that Snabb is a fairly young project. Some parts are
well documented, others are not, and there are not many examples of how
its libraries work, even scattered around GitHub. Snabb itself is pretty
small and well factored, which helps a lot. More generally, networking is
a vast space. When it comes to introducing people to using tools built
on Snabb, there is often some incredulity about using a garbage-collected
high-level language to do high-performance networking, but LuaJIt has a
solid track record in this space by now. Aside from that, most people
are not used to thinking of the timescales involved. Depending on the
expected average packet size, if you are driving a 10 gigabit card, you
have tens to hundreds of nanoseconds per packet. With these constraints,
you need to think about when you will hit RAM, and things like system
calls are prohibitively expensive.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SS:</b></span> Why did you end up choosing LuaJIt instead of, for
example, straight C?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>KB:</b></span> Snabb is written in LuaJIt, so the choice of language (and
license&mdash;it's APLv2) came with the choice to use Snabb. That said, using
LuaJIt is excellent for projects like this. It is a just-in-time trace
compiler, so the actual code being run is shaped by the packets being
seen, and there are no branch mispredictions within a trace. It also
makes it extremely easy to use C when appropriate. It has an extremely
nice FFI, good support for packed structs, and calling C code seems as
easy as it would be if the whole project were in C. The code itself
tends to be more concise and quicker to write&mdash;it is quite comparable
to Python or Ruby in that regard. It is quite pleasant not to have to
read past boilerplate details.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SS:</b></span> What tools are you using to track down bottlenecks and get the
optimization you need for the tight time constraints?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>KB:</b></span> The tools that we are using to track down bottlenecks include
PMU counters and a combination of logical thinking about what is likely
to be a bottleneck, followed by measuring changes to see whether they
actually make an improvement. Having a small system makes the latter a
surprisingly tractable approach. We also look at LuaJIt's trace dumps,
which include IR (Intermediate Representation) and x86 assembly.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SS:</b></span> Have you had to break parts out to C yet?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>KB:</b></span> I have not personally had to break parts out to C yet. People
occasionally do&mdash;for instance, if they want to hide an unpredictable
branch from the trace compiler. Another alternative that a colleague of
mine used recently is DynASM, which allows you to generate
assembly dynamically. He used it for some AVX2 instructions to access memory 256
bits at a time. One of the very surprising things about LuaJIt is
that it often is as fast as C, and swapping code out for C blindly can
genuinely make performance worse, as you lose the benefits of traces.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SS:</b></span> How much do you have to know about the specific hardware this
will be running on to keep the speed up? Is architecture plus network
card enough, or are you falling into &ldquo;oh, sorry, you have a brand of
RAM we never tested...&rdquo; level of optimization specificity?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>KB:</b></span> So far, micro-architecture (Haswell vs. Sky Lake) and raw
CPU speed do make a noticeable difference in performance for some
applications. For others, like the packetblaster app that ships with
Snabb, any modern CPU Snabb can run on is so far beyond what is needed
that the bottleneck is the network cards.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SS:</b></span> So, to recap, Snabb Switch is an open-source
<span   class="emphasis"><em>userspace</em></span>
application written mostly in LuaJIt that's pushing network traffic
on run-of-the-mill COTS x86_64 easily at 1Gbps, with a 100Gbps target
in 2016...by bypassing the Linux kernel for faster performance...and
you say you're getting comparable performance to C code from LuaJIt,
without excessive scaffolding for performance testing.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>KB:</b></span> Yep.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SS:</b></span> So, how big is this thing again?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>KB:</b></span> The source is less than 5MB; the resulting binary is something like
2MB before compression.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SS:</b></span> Impressive. However, this isn't just some endpoint software,
it's infrastructure&mdash;what does your team do to ensure code quality
and security?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>KB:</b></span> For code quality, my team uses continuous integration,
tests and code review. All code is reviewed by at least one person
other than the author before being committed to the main development
branch. We have a variety of end-to-end and unit tests. Pflua also
has property-based tests, which compare its results with and without
optimization to libpcap's results on randomly generated filters. We
have plans to do more property-based and fuzz testing. Additionally,
the small size of the system makes it easier to pay close attention to
code quality. For security, all of the above, along with thinking hard
and paying close attention to RFCs and their notes on security. Our
fragmentation reassembly code rejects overlapping fragments as more
recent RFCs recommend, for example.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SS:</b></span> When you bring on new developers, how do you inculcate them into
this kind of rigor given how little it's present in other programming
shops, and how essential it is for developing infrastructure software?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>KB:</b></span> I introduced it to my team when I joined in 2014. We started
using continuous integration software and property-based testing at
that point, both of which significantly increased the reliability of
pflua. Code reviews also help. We have had only one person join our
team since; as we grow more, perhaps I will have a better answer for
that. The code also had a lot of conceptual rigor to begin with. My
colleague who shaped pflua most deeply, Andy Wingo, spends most of his
time working on compilers, which also demands a fairly high level of
rigor and coherent design.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SS:</b></span> If you were to guess, about what percentage of your project's effort is
spent on new code/features vs. testing/refining/optimizing, writing test
code and scaffolding for fuzz testing vs. documenting and planning tasks?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>KB:</b></span> It depends on the phase of each project, I'd say. They tend
to start off with a flurry of features and planning, and some testing is
done in parallel. Later in each project, we optimize and test more. The
efforts compliment each other well, as more extensive tests catch subtle
mistakes attempts at optimization can introduce. Some of the features are
specifically linked to performance goals, which makes them fall thoroughly
into being both new code/features and testing/refining/optimizing at
the same time. My colleague Andy Wingo's recent work with dynasm is an
example. Earlier in the lwaftr project, almost all of the time was going
to new code and features, with perhaps 20% going into testing them. Before
the alpha release, the whole team focused almost entirely on performance
for a few weeks. At the moment, I think it might be around 50/50.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SS:</b></span> If you were to break it down to two to five principles the Snabb Switch
toolkit is built on, what would they be?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>KB:</b></span> I would actually break it down to just one: systems should be
small, and individuals should be able to hold the whole system in their
head. Most of the other principles are consequences of this, and the
high-speed software-defined networking/network function virtualization
niche it is designed for.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SS:</b></span> Why is this so important to Snabb Switch in particular?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>KB:</b></span> It is an important principle for software wherever it can
reasonably be applied, and it is one thing that strongly drew me toward
Snabb. I can only speculate that for Snabb in particular, it came from
Luke's background with Smalltalk&mdash;where he took the quotes describing
this principle from&mdash;and other minimal systems like Forth.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SS:</b></span> What do you like best about working on Snabb Switch?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>KB:</b></span> Snabb is a really fun and interesting project to be involved
with these days. Between the design principles and being able not
only to replace old network functions but also implement entirely new ones on
commodity x86 hardware and network cards that cost a few hundred bucks,
I think it has a really exciting future.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SS:</b></span> So, what got you interested in tweaking this type of networking code?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>KB:</b></span> This is my day job. I joined Igalia in 2014, when the networking
team was working on pflua. Pflua is a library on top of Snabb that
uses a subset of libpcap's filtering language. It is smaller, faster,
and the subset that it supports is believed to be entirely compatible
except for libpcap optimizer bugs.
</p><p>
I got into networking as a hobby back around 2000 though. I ran a
small home network on Linux, various BSDs, read a lot of books, played
around, etc. I have liked systems programming and dynamic languages for
about as long, so a job that involves all of these elements is pretty fun.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SS:</b></span> Did you make a specific effort to choose companies where you'd
be doing open-source work, or was it luck?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>KB:</b></span> Igalia does only free software, and this was a major factor in
my choosing to work for them. I did also interview at other companies
that do a mixture of free and non-free software.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SS:</b></span> Do you have any advice for coders interested in Snabb Switch in
particular, or in moving from places higher up the stack into more
infrastructure-y areas of programming work like what you're doing?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>KB:</b></span> For coders interested in Snabb Switch in particular, it depends
on their background; ones with more relevant experience can probably jump
in and implement something Luke brain-dumps about on the mailing list, or
something else entirely. For those newer to these kinds of programming, I
would recommend starting by writing a Snabb app. These can be as simple as
a packet blaster or an app that echoes packets between interfaces, or more
complex than the l2vpn or lwAFTR, and can be built up incrementally. Some
of the tests can be run, and app development can be done, on any modern
x86 machine running Linux. I prototyped the lwAFTR on my development
laptop, which has no Ethernet cards. Snabb has a mechanism for plugging
apps into each other that makes running it on real hardware a simple
matter of changing a couple lines of configuration and recompiling.
