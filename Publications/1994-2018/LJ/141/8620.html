<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #141, January 2006</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

<span   class="bold"><b>Ahmad Reza Cheraghi</b></span> has begun work on some infrastructure to allow the
<span   class="bold"><b>kernel .config file</b></span> to be created
automatically based on the system
hardware. This project provides more of a framework for continued
development than an actual fully fledged solution. Ahmad's intention is that
over time, the various experts will add hardware detection rules to his
infrastructure, so that <tt  >make autoconfig</tt> will become more and more
accurate. His work so far has gotten a mixed reaction. Folks like
<span   class="bold"><b>Hua Zhong</b></span>
are thrilled that this sort of thing is being done, because it will bring
kernel compilation one step closer to the average user; however, folks like
<span   class="bold"><b>Roman Zippel</b></span> seem skeptical that this framework could ever be completed and
may languish in a partly usable state for a long time.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>David Teigland</b></span> has been trying to get
<span   class="bold"><b>GFS2</b></span>, the clustered filesystem, into
the kernel for a while now, with much controversy. Part of the problem has
just been the name. The GFS developers claim to have tacked on the 2 at the
end for their own reference, not realizing this would turn it into a
whole new project that would have to win acceptance into the kernel all
over again. GFS is already in the kernel, and an update to GFS would have a
much easier time getting in than a new project. But others feel there is
more to it than this. GFS2 is not fully compatible with the original
GFS&mdash;specifically the disk format has changed between the two versions, making it
impossible to mount GFS directory trees under GFS2. There are other
differences, and <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span> has been very reluctant to accept the new
code without seeing some kind of justification from the authors. This
justification, apparently, has not been forthcoming.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>FUSE</b></span> (Filesystem in Userspace) filesystem has finally made it into the
main kernel, after a long period of uncertainty. <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> has never
liked the project, saying that it just wasn't possible to separate
the guts of a filesystem from the kernel's internals cleanly. But
<span   class="bold"><b>Miklos Szeredi</b></span>,
the principal developer, did finally answer most objections and showed
convincingly that any remaining ugliness actually could not be avoided. This
was apparently the real holdup for a long time, but after living for a while
in Andrew Morton's -mm tree without requiring any major fixes, and without
any other developer being able to suggest alternatives to the remaining
weird hackery, Andrew and Linus were both convinced. FUSE made its first
appearance in the main kernel tree in 2.6.14-rc1, and can be expected in
2.6.14.
</p><p>
There has been some concern that Andrew Morton will become overloaded by all
the kernel work he's doing. As Linus Torvalds has said, &ldquo;I actually worry
that Andrew will at some point be where I was a couple of years
ago&mdash;overworked and stressed out by just tons and tons of
patches.&rdquo; It's true
that a huge number of patches funnel through Andrew each day, but he says
the sheer volume is not the biggest problem. It's the patches that don't
actually work that cause him to waste hours. Putting out a release of his
-mm tree is very time consuming, because it must boot on four different
architectures and compile on at least seven. Any failure means tracking down the
bogus patch and removing it, and then trying the whole thing again. In
practice, this pushes the new release to the next day. Meanwhile, new patches
keep flying in. In spite of this, Andrew says he doesn't feel overloaded,
and he even has time to monitor and respond to the kernel bugs database and
chase down maintainers to answer questions about various code submissions.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span> has handed
maintainership of the <span   class="bold"><b>I2C Subsystem</b></span> off to
<span   class="bold"><b>Jean Delvare</b></span>. The two had been working quite closely on it for some months,
presumably preparing for this change, and now Greg has made it official. He
still will be involved in I2C development to a lesser degree, and he
also will remain the conduit for submitting I2C patches to Andrew Morton and
Linus Torvalds for inclusion in their trees.

Geekcorps (<a href="http://www.geekcorps.org" target="_self">www.geekcorps.org</a>) promotes economic growth in the
developing world by sending highly skilled technology volunteers to
teach communities how to use innovative and affordable information and
communication technologies to solve development problems.
</p><p>
Geekcorps is in search of the few, the proud, the Linux Geeks who not
only know Linux networking, including extensive management tools,
but who also can teach French-speaking Malians what they're doing so the
Malians
can replicate and maintain the systems they design.
</p><p>
If you think you can do that, in French, then check out the Geekcorps
Mali Connectivity Project in greater detail: <a href="http://mali.geekcorps.org" target="_self">mali.geekcorps.org</a>. Geekcorps is teaching Malian radio stations and community centers how to
work with Linux-based systems, connect the systems with Wi-Fi and VSAT,
and maintain both the systems and connections with great ingenuity and
minimal expense.
</p><p>
Volunteers would stay in Mali about four months, working on multiple
projects and with local counterparts in a hands-on setting. Geekcorps can
offer great benefits besides that warm and fuzzy feeling from doing good.
</p><p>
International airfare, expat-level lodging, decent living stipend and
dedicated in-country staff are provided. Daily challenges and rewards
are guaranteed.

If you're a typical <i  >Linux Journal</i> reader, you know
all about Linux bootloaders and runlevels, when and how to use scp to
save time while maintaining security, how to change the background color
or underline text in an xterm, and how to roll your own backup/restore
solution. But what if you're kind of new to Linux and don't even know
that you can make text in an xterm magenta? Despite what some might
say, there's no shame in not knowing something and admitting that. So,
whether you're a new Linux user or know someone who is&mdash;or maybe even
want to brush up on some basics yourself&mdash;stop by LinuxJournal.com. There,
you'll find articles such as:

If there's one aspect of Linux that has led to its popularity, it is the
ability of a suitably enthused individual to produce their own
distribution. It has spawned thousands of different solutions and, in
turn, has led to the creation of numerous tools and products that we
all find useful.

If you have a lot of scripts, shell functions or
aliases that depend on SSH, you're probably already
using ssh-agent and ssh-add to store your identity so
you don't have to retype your passphrase every time.
</p><p>
But what happens when you forget to run ssh-add, and
you run one of your scripts that uses SSH? You get
a passphrase prompt for every command that uses SSH
transport, whether it's rsync, cvs, scp or unison.
</p><p>
To stop the prompts and give yourself a chance to
enter the passphrase once, here's how a script
can check to make sure you have an identity loaded
before doing an <tt  >ssh</tt>. Just use the return value of
<tt  >ssh-add -L</tt>, which is true if you have an identity
loaded, false if you don't.
</p><p>
One line, as in a script:

<pre     class="programlisting">

ssh-add -L &amp;&amp; rsync -a Images xenu.example.com:Images

</pre>
</p><p>
To control a longer block of commands, as in a shell
function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sync_images()
{
  ssh-add -L || return 1
  rsync -a Images xenu.example.com:Images
  # more commands here if you like
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Run one of those examples without an identity
loaded, and you get a nice &ldquo;The agent has no
identities.&rdquo; error message instead of an annoying
passphrase prompt.
