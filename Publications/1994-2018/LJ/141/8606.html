How one company and its customers survived Hurricane Katrina&mdash;and the
lessons they teach the rest of us.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x2997348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
When Hurricane Katrina slammed New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in
August 2005, it quickly became the worst natural disaster in US history.
After the levees broke and the Gulf of Mexico poured into New Orleans,
law and order failed along with the civic graces we call infrastructure.
As the waters rose, electric service went out, along with phone, cell,
cable and tap water. TV and radio stations went silent. So did
communications among police, fire and emergency services. Hospitals
struggled to survive along with their patients. On the roofs of
submerged houses and the shores of drowned parishes, citizens waited for
help from services rendered just as helpless&mdash;while looters emptied
stores and snipers shot at rescuers. For the next fortnight, New Orleans
was Mogadishu.
</p><p>
Yet one beacon of infrastructural persistence stood like a lighthouse
above the storm and the tides: DirectNIC, the domain name registrar and
site hosting service operated by Intercosmos Media Group, Inc., a
company founded by Sigmund &ldquo;Sig&rdquo; Solares, who is also its CEO. Sig was
born, raised and educated in New Orleans, earning his BA, law degree
and MBA from Loyola University there. He is also a determined and
resourceful businessman with a loyalty to his company, his customers and
his city that verges on the absolute.
</p><p>
In the course of keeping DirectNIC up, Sig and his crew also opened a
lifeline to the world, serving as a firsthand source of zero-BS news
and photojournalism while also providing much-needed technical help. The
survival of DirectNIC is a triumphant story of open source in every
meaning of the phrase. It may also be the best DIY-IT (Do-It-Yourself
IT) story of all time: a shining example of how to survive a true
worst-case scenario.
</p><p>
DirectNIC isn't a small IT potato. According to Netcraft (see the on-line Resources),
DirectNIC is the world's #11 domain name registrar, with more than 400,000
customers and 1.1 million domains. It's also a large hosting service
taking up 6,800 square feet on the 9th and 10th floors of an office
building on Lafayette Square, close to the Superdome and the shores of
the city's drowned districts.
</p><p>
Not coincidentally, DirectNIC runs on Linux. As soon as I saw that was
the case, I began trying to get in touch with Sig. He finally found time
to give me a 45-minute interview
on September 7, 2005,
while the disaster was still going on. (To place it in a timeline, the
levees were still breached, the city was still under water, chaos still
ruled and five days would pass before FEMA director Michael Brown
resigned.) We did that interview as background for this column. We also
made it a podcast you can download from IT Conversations (see Resources).
</p><p>
&ldquo;When we first started out, we had to go with Linux because we didn't
have the money for any other options&rdquo;, Sig explained. He
continued:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We hired
programmers who were familiar with Linux. That's just the direction we
went. It's made it easy to find employees. We use Red Hat. Everything of
course is Apache, MySQL, PHP. We have 17 programmers, and we try
to get everything done with PHP and MySQL. If fact, back when they were
small, MySQL had a couple of meetings each year. They used our training
facility and did their training here. We're big on hiring their training
people to get our programmers up to speed.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Thus, what was already clear on the Web became vivid on the phone: Sig
and his team are resourceful and determined in large and equal measures.
&ldquo;We have our own 6,800 square-foot data center. It was built for us by
Enron, which went in to bankruptcy. We went in to bankruptcy court and
said 'We'll give you 5 cents on the dollar for it.' And they said,
'We'll take it.'&rdquo;
</p><p>
As for dependencies, DirectNIC is closer with its customers than with
its vendors:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We've always bought HP servers. We used to have white boxes; but we
had some problems, so since 2000 we've been using HP. We've been
very happy with those servers. MySQL has always helped us with
technical questions. We have a support package with them. But in
this case, we really didn't need help from them. In fact, in this
case, we didn't turn to any of our vendors. We actually turned to a
couple of our customers who were in the area, and we needed diesel,
so she went and bought a (Hummer) H1. She's like, &ldquo;Look, I'm going
to make sure you can get diesel in there. And you'll also have a
cool vehicle afterwards.&rdquo;
</p></blockquote></div><p>
As Katrina approached and orders came to evacuate, Sig made his position
clear:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I told all my IT guys, &ldquo;I'm not asking anybody to stay. If
you're going to stay, and want to come to the office, great. I'm going
to be here.&rdquo; Myself, I stayed. Donny Simonson, a Senior Vice
President&mdash;he's in charge of all our programmers&mdash;he stayed. All of our net ops
guys left town. Then Michael Barnett, a friend of mine&mdash;he never
worked for the company before&mdash;he wanted to stay at the office. He
already had a Live Journal blog where he called himself the Interdictor.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
In fact, Michael Barnett is a former Green Beret who clearly felt his
experience and skills would come in handy. His title became Crisis
Manager, and his early Katrina entries make clear that managing was
exactly what he intended to do:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Sunday, Aug. 28, 12:01 p.m.
We're on the 10th and 11th floor of a corporate high-rise on Poydras
Ave., right near St. Charles. We have generators and tons of food
and water. It is five of us total. I am not sure how the Internet
connection will be affected. I have a camera and my gun.
</p><p>
Monday, Aug. 29, 5:12 a.m.
Welcome to ground zero.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
An hour later, Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana as a
Category 4 storm with winds over 145 mph. That same morning, the 17th
Street Canal levee was breached. And the Gulf of Mexico poured into New
Orleans through Lake Pontchatrain.
</p><p>
DirectNIC also took a direct hit, as rain and wind broke through the
windows of DirectNIC's facility. &ldquo;You never expect to have water come
into your data center when it's on the 10th floor of a building&rdquo;, Sig
said. Yet, they were prepared. Sort of. Sig explains:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We're always looking for angles.
</p><p>
Any time we make T-shirts, it's a sure sign it's going to be a
failed business project. Luckily we had a failed project so we had
2,000 of these T-shirts. They were perfect for sandbags....
</p><p>
First, we created a barricade of T-shirts. We grabbed buckets and
mops. We also grabbed a wet-vac to suck up the water. So we had six
or seven people who were doing nothing but sucking up the water.
Meanwhile we could hear the hurricane break the glass behind the
wall that we had....And any time the glass breaks, that's going to
allow more water through the walls...and head toward our servers.
</p><p>
Today we have cardboard over the vents just to keep the air
conditioning in. The storm shutters aren't going to keep the AC in.
</p><p>
The generator is on the 9th floor and we're on the 10th floor. We
also have a 1,500-gallon diesel tank on the 10th floor. We have 120
tons of coolers for the air conditioning, and blowers, on the 11th
floor.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
DirectNIC could stay up only by keeping the generators going and the AC
cooling the servers. Also by making sure their fiber optic connections
to the Net were working. &ldquo;We knew we'd lose OC-3s from time to
time&rdquo;, Sig
said. &ldquo;So we had four OC-3s when we knew we could get by with only
two.&rdquo;
(OC-3 stands for Optical Carrier level 3, the highest currently
provided. An OC-3 line carries three times the base OC-1 rate of
51.84Mbps, or 155.52Mbps.) He continued:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We had to shut a couple things down, but we had at least one OC-3
in operation all through the entire time....
</p><p>
We were relying on three different providers for four OC-3s. Two of
them went down. The third was close to running out of fuel, so we
had to find a way to get fuel to their facility. One of my customers
got on a fuel truck with the National Guard and went down the street
to make sure the fuel got to the facility....The provider told us
they were going to run out of fuel if they didn't get it by
Saturday. So...Brian got on the truck with the National Guard and
made sure the fuel got to the building. It was near the Superdome,
where the flooding was pretty bad. There was no way we could take a
truck there. You had to have one of the military high water vehicles
to get the diesel there.
</p><p>
The fiber is all underground, but was fine. Most of the generators
were above ground and were fine; but the problem was getting fuel to
the generators. Our generator is on the 9th floor. Another one was
a couple floors up. So the biggest problem was just getting the fuel
to the building, and also getting past all of the military, to
convince them that there was enough reason. You have to get approval
from City Hall to get fuel moved where you need it.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Meanwhile, the absence of net ops workers put a squeeze on the small
remaining staff:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
During this whole process, we did have a lot of questions. And one
of the problems we had was all of our employees who left....We
couldn't reach them by cell phone. The main method of communication
was through the blog, and through e-mail and stuff like that. We'd
say, &ldquo;Okay, here are problems that we don't know how to figure out
because the guys who usually figure this stuff out are far, far
away.&rdquo;
So we were able to get a lot of help in that manner.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
For example,
&ldquo;We were so worried that we would not get diesel for several weeks
that we had to figure out, 'How can we lessen the load so that we
can stretch out our diesel for as long as possible?' We got a lot of
information on that, straight from comments in the blog.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Meanwhile, Michael Barnett's Interdictor became a virtual port in a
real-world storm. While the blog served as a half-duplex one-to-any help
line for DirectNIC, it also served as on-the-ground zero-BS source of
Solid Information about what was actually happening in deepest New
Orleans. Michael did most of the posting and had no time for small
talk. Every post was a punch to the fat belly of the media beast that
was caught no less flatfooted than the local, state and federal offices
quickly proved to be. For example, this entry on August 30:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I keep being told that CNN and the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Slate</em></span> reported
our &ldquo;moods&rdquo; as
something other than upbeat. The city is falling apart, no doubt.
The looting is rampant. Just take a look at the cam and you'll see
them breaking into that hotel and taking everything. The water is
still creeping in. But you know what? My team's mood is not
negative. We're focused. We've got things that need doing and we're
gonna get them done. That's all there is to it. We need diesel.
We'll find some. We have people depending on us and we are not going
to let them down. That's all there is to it.
</p><p>
And if that's not enough to put our situation in perspective, just
remember we live here.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
And, the next day:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
If you're watching the cam you'll note that there are WHITE people,
BLACK people, and HISPANIC people looting. It's interesting to note
that I see no ASIANS looting, but I'll leave that observation to the
sociologists to explain. Back to the point, don't bring your PC
bullshit to this blog. This crisis is not about race, but about
inhumanity. Got it?
</p></blockquote></div><p>
As a result, The Interdictor took on a media life of its own. On
September 1, six days into the Katrina disaster, Michael wrote, &ldquo;This
blog was never intended to be some kind of springboard to fame. I had no
idea it would be... well, be what it is now. It's nothing short of
stunning....&rdquo; That post alone had more than 500 comments. Many came in via
links from the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Times</em></span> of London and other bigtime publications, as well
as thousands of other blogs.
</p><p>
Yet media stardom did nothing to distract from DirectNIC's primary
mission. Here's the first thing Michael posted on September 2:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Outpost Crystal has had a long day. Alpha Team is gonna grab a few
hours of sleep. You guys are great and all your support is pure
motivation to keep plowing ahead. We won't quit, I promise you.
We're expecting today (Friday) to be our most physically demanding
day so far. Sig and I will be pushing 18 55-gallon drums of
diesel up a steep parking garage incline to the 9th floor generator.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
And the next day:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The three guys you just saw on the Webcam are Jeff and Hank of Data
Protection Services (one of our
customers who swore to their customers that they would not go down
because of this storm), and Doctor Tom, an anesthesiologist. These
three men heroically found a way to deliver us fuel and supplies
into this disaster zone. I say heroically, because the amount of
effort it took them to coordinate a way to get a container and fuel
and a route in to the city in the face of persistent danger on the
streets was absolutely off the charts. Their customers need to know
the lengths that these men went to in order to get the job done. I
listened to their accounts and I was absolutely impressed by the
initiative and resourcefulness of these guys.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The result, one month later (as I'm writing this, in early October 2005), is
a growing body of wisdom about DIY-IT and both preparing and
recovering from natural disasters. Sig explains:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We've been through hurricanes before. We said &ldquo;Okay, we need to
hurry up and get some diesel, and have diesel on standby, and have
the standby tank completely filled.&rdquo; The first time we had only one
pump. And a diesel pump is going to burn out, and you have to wait
for it to cool off. So we learned a lot because we've already been
around a couple of times. But nothing nearly this scale. So this
time it was definitely a trial by fire.
</p><p>
We've done migrations before. But when we've migrated from one data
center to another, the biggest migration we had was five racks. We
did five racks across the country. This time we had a 6,800 square-foot data center. Things just end up so much more complicated.
Especially when you throw in the fact that now most of your
employees you can't reach. We did have seven to ten guys who do a
lot of telecommuting work. That's one of the things that really
helped us out. One of the owners lives in Naples, Florida. He
handled all of the coordination of migrating stuff away from this
facility. So he just worked around the clock for a week, starting
with the most critical stuff and working his way down. We have a lot
of customers who aren't worried about having a solution redundant
across two data centers. They'll pay us $15 for a domain and we host
it for free. So in those cases we don't provide two different
solutions. So if this data center were to go down, they'd be down.
But once we were faced with the prospect of the data center going
away, we wanted to do everything we could to prevent that from
happening.
</p><p>
I've just been focused on making sure everything has been under
control.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Sig is as plain about his company's role as a news source as he is about
its role in the marketplace: &ldquo;We've definitely tried to put out as much information as possible
while doing everything that has to be done.&rdquo;
</p><p>
DirectNIC also worked to help communications inside New Orleans as well.
Sig reports:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
There are so many different organizations. I've talked with Alabama
police, Florida police, reserves....The communications between the
different groups are not very good. [This is one] of the things we're
trying to help. The city's phones (mayor's office and so on) are
handled by one of our customers. So if our facility were to go down,
the city wouldn't have any phones. NOPD lost so much of their
capacity to communicate as a result of Katrina. We had a police
officer who stayed with us and went 24 hours without hearing from
command.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Exactly one month after I spoke with Sig, he published an open e-mail on
the Interdictor, which he and Michael Barnett had transformed into the
Survival of New Orleans blog, with a new URL: mgno.com. That e-mail
contains such valuable and hard-won lessons that I can find no way to
edit it down. Here it is:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Recently I received an e-mail from a customer who was worried about
domain names that he registered at DirectNIC because of
the problems in New Orleans. Let me make one thing perfectly clear:
Every other business in New Orleans may fail; nevertheless,
Intercosmos Media Group, Inc., operators of DirectNIC,
will continue on successfully in New Orleans and/or elsewhere
without interruptions to our clients.
</p><p>
New Orleans has never been known as a pro-business location. Despite
this, we have thrived in the Crescent City. Prior to Katrina, we were
one of the most successful businesses in New Orleans. A few days
after Hurricane Katrina hit, only two offices had their lights
powered on the main street (Poydras Street), in the heart of the
CBD. Those two offices were Bell South and Intercosmos Media Group,
Inc. It was no accident that we continued to operate.
</p><p>
At Intercosmos, we did nothing special to prepare for Hurricane
Katrina. We had already prepared for dozens of prior hurricanes and
we already had our disaster preparations in place. The following is
a very short summary of how we have prepared for any catastrophe:
</p><p>
1. Require Excellence from Employees. A small excellent team can
accomplish anything. If you have the right team, then you can
survive and actually thrive during any disaster. We have spent years
putting together the right team of employees to operate under any
circumstance.
</p><p>
2. Built an Excessively Large War Chest. At Intercosmos, we have
never borrowed money to facilitate growth. We always focused on
increasing liquid assets while maintaining steady profitable growth.
For this strategy, we just followed Bill Gates who likes to keep a
large amount of cash on hand for a rainy day. Because of this we are
well positioned to weather any storm or series of storms.
</p><p>
3. Secured a $3 Million Line of Credit. We secured this line of
credit despite the fact that we had and still have no intention of
using this line of credit. The line of credit is merely a safety net.
</p><p>
4. Lots of Insurance. We are insurance junkies at Intercosmos.
Nevertheless, as a result of Hurricane Katrina and our preparedness,
we will have fairly limited claims to make.
</p><p>
5. Telecommuter Plan in Place. Prior to Hurricane Katrina hitting,
close to 50% of our employees had telecommuting agreements in place
with the company. When any hurricane hits and employees evacuate, we
plan for employees to telecommute through the use of Internet-based
(VoIP) phones, wireless Internet and laptops.
</p><p>
After Hurricane Katrina hit:
</p><p>
1. Increased levels of redundancy. Now we have servers in four secure,
distant facilities instead of just in two facilities.
</p><p>
2. Increased profitability and cash on hand. Our business does not
rely on areas hit by Katrina. Well over 99% of our business comes
from individuals and businesses outside of Louisiana. As a result,
we were actually more profitable in the month after Katrina hit than
we were in the month prior to Katrina hitting.
</p><p>
3. We started to use an 8,000-square-foot building that we have in
another state as a re-location work space for employees. Employees
who cannot work in one of our buildings in New Orleans can work as a
telecommuter or from our other office.
</p><p>
What can you do to help?
</p><p>
We are passionate about our city. We want to see New Orleans rise
again. However, our fate is not tied to New Orleans. We are trying
to raise awareness of problems in New Orleans because we want the
rebuilding effort to succeed and not get tied down in politics as
usual. If you would like to help us on this mission, we ask that you
join in the conversations at the message board we launched at
<a href="http://nola.us" target="_self">nola.us</a>.
</p><p>
Sincerely,
</p><p>
Sigmund Solares
Chief Executive Officer
Intercosmos Media Group, Inc.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
My wife divides the world into &ldquo;savers&rdquo; and
&ldquo;spenders&rdquo;. Her theory is
that most of us are born as one or the other. She's a saver. I'm a
spender. Our four kids include two of each. Phil Hughes, our founder and
publisher here at <i  >Linux Journal</i>, is a saver. Near as I can tell, so is
Linus Torvalds. After hanging out with Andrew Morton (the kernel
maintainer that Linus calls his &ldquo;right-hand man&rdquo;) on last fall's Linux
Lunacy Geek Cruise, I'm convinced that he's a saver too.
</p><p>
So, clearly, is Sig Solares.
</p><p>
As my wife explains it, the difference between savers and spenders is
debt. Especially credit-card debt. She didn't want to marry me until I
carried no credit-card debt and began paying my bills in their entirety
every month. I've done that for so long now that it gives me chills to
think about going back to my old ways. I may be a born spender, but I'm
not a practicing one. At least not when it comes to debt.
</p><p>
Linux, I believe, is the saver's operating system. The values of saving
are also embodied in the development and application practices of every
free software and open-source project.
</p><p>
Surviving disasters is about saving too. That's the lesson that
transcends politics, race, class and every other issue that divides us.
When the going gets tough and the tough get going, the ones that go
farthest will be the ones who saved most in the first place.
