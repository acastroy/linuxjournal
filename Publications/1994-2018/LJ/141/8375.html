Welcome back! Last month we blasted through getting your single sign-on
and corporate directory infrastructure up and running. In this article,
we configure some Linux clients and Mac OS X clients to
make full use of last month's hard work. We don't have as many pieces
to investigate this time, but we still have a lot to cover, so let's
get to it! Again, all the configuration files are available from the
on-line Resources.
</p><p>
In this article, we explore how to connect Gentoo Linux and Red Hat
Enterprise Linux (RHEL) v3 and v4, but most Linux clients should be
about the same to configure, with minor differences. We also cover
Mac OS X v10.4 (aka Tiger) client integration. In a later article,
we'll explain how to configure Microsoft Windows clients to use the
authentication and authorization system, since it depends on configuring
and setting up the Samba package.
</p><p>
For single sign-on, Linux and Tiger clients need a Kerberos host
keytab. We create one the same way we created other keytabs. For both
Linux and Tiger clients, this keytab is kept in /etc/krb5.keytab.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a3f580.0x1b37500"></a>
Linux Client Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Not all users, especially remote laptop users, will want or be able to
have their machine incorporated fully into the Kerberos realm. Unless you
have complete control of all the machines from which users will connect,
you need to allow traditional password authentication. While this
defeats some of the security of using Kerberos by having to transmit
passwords over the Net, as long as you are aware of this as a sysadmin
and take precautions to limit its use, you're no worse off than if you
had not chosen to use Kerberos. Kerberos still has a few advantages over
mechanisms such as /etc/passwd, NIS or LDAP storage of passwords. It's
much simpler to enforce password rules with Kerberos than with the
other mechanisms, and the storage of the passwords is more secure in
a Kerberos database. Make sure to review &ldquo;Centralized Authentication
with Kerberos 5, Part I&rdquo; by Alf Wachsmann (see Resources) on enabling Kerberos PAM authentication.
</p><p>
In &ldquo;OpenLDAP Everywhere&rdquo; by Craig Swanson and Matt Lung (see
Resources), the authors touched on /etc/nsswitch.conf
/etc/ldap.conf and /etc/openldap/ldap.conf. We're going to tweak
these files to refine them for speed and security. First, let's
look at /etc/openldap/ldap.conf. This file defines defaults for
the OpenLDAP command-line tools, such as ldapadd and ldapsearch. Our
/etc/openldap/ldap.conf file looks like Listing 1.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a3f580.0x1b37710"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. /etc/openldap/ldap.conf
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
BASE "o=ci,dc=example,dc=com"
URI ldaps://ldap.example.com ldaps://kdc.example.com
TLS_CACERTDIR /etc/ssl/certs
TLS_REQCERT allow
</pre></div><p>
For more options and more information, refer to ldap.conf(5).
Because there's no way to specify that we
want to use StartTLS in /etc/openldap/ldap.conf, we must explicitly use
an ldaps:// URL. Now we can
simply issue <tt  >ldapsearch</tt>, which uses SASL authentication by default and
then refers to /etc/openldap/ldap.conf for the default host and base.
</p><p>
Let's now work on getting name service switch (NSS) working properly. Make
sure the nss_ldap package is installed. Also, be aware that older
versions of this package didn't handle LDAP storage of some services
such as netgroups, so try to get the latest version you can. First
configure the nss_ldap package itself by editing /etc/ldap.conf.
This file differs from /etc/openldap/ldap.conf, which is only for the
OpenLDAP tools, whereas /etc/ldap.conf is the configuration file for
nss_ldap. Listing 2 shows what /etc/ldap.conf should look like.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a3f580.0x1b379d0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. /etc/ldap.conf
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
host ldap.example.com kdc.example.com
base o=ci,dc=example,dc=com

ssl start_tls
tls_checkpeer no
tls_cacertfile /etc/ssl/certs/ci-cert.pem

nss_base_passwd ou=people,o=ci,dc=example,dc=com
nss_base_group ou=group,o=ci,dc=example,dc=com
nss_base_hosts ou=hosts,o=ci,dc=example,dc=com
nss_base_services ou=services,o=ci,dc=example,dc=com
nss_base_netgroup ou=netgroups,o=ci,dc=example,dc=com
</pre></div><p>
Let's look at what these different lines do, as there is no man page
for this file. The first two lines define the LDAP servers to contact
and the base from which to search. The next three lines explain how
to initiate the TLS connection. As you can see, nss_ldap is aware of
StartTLS, so we use that method to initiate a TLS connection. The last
lines describe the bases to search from for various nsswitch controlled
attributes. We set these for performance reasons. There's no need to
have to search the whole directory for a given user name if all of our
user names are under one branch of the tree. For example, nss_base_passwd
specifies the base for searches traditionally associated with information
in /etc/passwd. If, however, you do store user names in multiple branches
of the directory, you can't use this option. A slew of other
options can be defined in this file. To explore these options,
check with the example ldap.conf that comes with the nss_ldap package.
</p><p>
Make sure you have the CA certificate in /etc/ssl/certs, and run c_rehash.
This process needs to be done for any machine that will be contacting
the LDAP server for any information over an SSL connection.
</p><p>
Next, edit /etc/nsswitch.conf to specify looking in LDAP for
information. Don't put ldap as the first entry for hosts; if you do, you
won't be able to resolve the LDAP server's hostname. If you had added a
user locally to /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow that you wanted to be served out
of LDAP, remove it or comment it out. Now you can test that it's working:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# getent passwd leggett
leggett:x:1001:100:Ti Leggett:/home/leggett:/bin/bash

# id leggett
uid=1001(leggett) gid=100(users)
</pre>
</p><p>
If both of these commands work, you're ready to go. Some programs require
a restart in order to recognize changes to /etc/nsswitch.conf. OpenSSH
is one of these, so restart sshd and then attempt to slogin.
</p><p>
Everything we've done so far has led us to enabling Gentoo and RHEL
clients, but let's review what needs to be in place.
</p><p>
The following files are needed for Kerberos authorization:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
/etc/krb5.conf
</p></li><li><p>
/etc/krb5.keytab
</p></li><li><p>
/etc/pam.d/system-auth
</p></li></ul></div><p>
And the following files define OpenLDAP account management:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
/etc/openldap/ldap.conf
</p></li><li><p>
/etc/ldap.conf
</p></li><li><p>
/etc/nsswitch.conf
</p></li><li><p>
/etc/ssl/certs/ci-cert.pem (Gentoo)
</p></li><li><p>
/usr/share/ssl/certs/ci-cert.pem (RHEL)
</p></li></ul></div><p>
There's one caveat for RHEL 4 at the time of this writing. A bug occurs
when you use hostnames in /etc/ldap.conf instead of IPs, so have LDAP as a
lookup for the hosts database in /etc/nsswitch.conf and use DHCP to get
client IPs. If you notice that bringing up your network devices causes
a segfault in dhclient, change hostnames to IPs in /etc/ldap.conf.
</p><p>
Configuring sshd for single sign-on under Gentoo and RHEL v4 is
a snap. You need to make sure the following options are set in
/etc/ssh/sshd_config:

<pre     class="programlisting">
GSSAPIAuthentication yes
GSSAPICleanupCredentials yes
UsePAM yes
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a3f580.0x1b38580"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Once you've set these, make sure to restart sshd.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, RHEL v3's sshd supports an older GSSAPI mechanism called
gssapi, which is susceptible to a man-in-the-middle attack. It's been
replaced by the gssapi-with-mic mechanism, which is what both RHEL v4 and
Gentoo use. If you're unsure which mechanism your sshd supports,
simply enable GSSAPI authentication in the sshd_config file and then
attempt to ssh in using the verbose flag. You'll get a report of all the
mechanisms that sshd supports. If you attempt to ssh from a client that
uses one mechanism to a server that uses the other, you'll be prompted
for your password. This is because the credential passing is done slightly
differently, and incompatibly, with each mechanism.
</p><p>
Our ultimate goal is for users to have to type their password only
once per day and never have that password go across the wire. So why go
through all this trouble if your users are sending their password over
the wire every time they check e-mail? Fortunately, more e-mail clients
are starting to support the GSSAPI mechanism. Unfortunately, if you're
a Mozilla Thunderbird user, you're out of luck (as of this writing). A
few other options exist, however; for example, both KDE's KMail v1.8 and
Ximian Evolution v2.2 have GSSAPI support. I've never used KMail,
so I'll stick to what I know. Configuring Evolution to use GSSAPI is
simple. Just select GSSAPI as the authentication type under both the
Receiving and Sending Email tabs (Figure 1). If you set the Use
Secure Connection option to Whenever Possible, Evolution uses
StartTLS to secure the data transport.

Mac OS X Clients</h2></div></div><p>
Starting with Tiger, Apple has Kerberized almost all portions of the
operating system. If you need to incorporate Panther (v10.3) clients
into your infrastructure, contact me for information; a good deal is
required. Tiger, however, is relatively easy.
</p><p>
Start by editing the file /Library/Preferences/edu.mit.Kerberos. This
file is quite similar to its Linux counterpart, /etc/krb5.conf, with
some very minor changes. Ours looks like Listing 3.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a3f580.0x1b38a50"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

  kdc = ldap.example.com:88
  admin_server = kdc.example.com:749
 }

[domain_realm]
 .example.com = CI.EXAMPLE.COM
 example.com = CI.EXAMPLE.COM
</pre></div><p>
With Kerberos configured, the next step is to create a keytab for the
host and place it in /etc/krb5.keytab. You can run kadmin from the OS X
client, but because the version that comes with v10.4 is slightly buggy,
you need to append the -O option:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#/usr/sbin/kadmin -p &lt;admin princ&gt; -O

</pre>
</p><p>
That's it for Kerberos authentication with Tiger.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, a bug causes the machine's
authentication subsystem to hang when a network user attempts to use
sudo while having valid Kerberos credentials. I'm working with Apple to
resolve this issue, so check back with me to find the solution.
</p><p>
Mac OS X does not use nsswitch for resolution of name
services. Instead, it uses what it calls Directory Services. I
explain how to modify Directory Services via a GUI called Directory
Access, but ultimately the GUI makes modifications to two files:
/Library/Preferences/DirectoryService/DSLDAPv3PlugInConfig.plist and
/Library/Preferences/DirectoryService/SearchNodeConfig.plist.
</p><p>
The GUI utility can be found in /Applications/Utilities. First, enable
the LDAPv3 plugin, then select it and click the Configure button. Once
inside, click the Show Options drop-down, and then click New to
define a new LDAP server. Enter your LDAP server's name, make sure all
three check boxes are checked (Figure 2), and click Continue. Next,
choose RFC 2307 (Unix) as the template, enter your LDAP base, click
Continue and define a Configuration Name. That's it!
</p><p>
You can refine how Directory Services searches the directory, much
as you can with /etc/ldap.conf under Linux. If you highlight the
directory service and click Edit, it brings up some more advanced
options. Click on the Search &amp; Mappings tab. There you'll see a list
labeled Record Types and Attributes. For each of those you can select
and then define a more specific Search base (Figure 3). Click Ok
twice, and then Apply to save your changes.

Figure 3. Refining OS X LDAP Searches
</p></div></div><p>
Of course, you'll want to verify that your directory changes are correct
and working. OS X has a command-line utility, dscl, that is used to query
not only an LDAP directory but also a NetInfo directory, NIS directory
or any other directory listed in Directory Access. First, we should make
sure we can query our LDAP server directly:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# dscl localhost list \
 /LDAPv3/ldap.example.com/Users
</pre>
</p><p>
If you run dscl without any options, you are given usage instructions
and left at an interactive prompt. Here are two more examples of using
dscl:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# dscl localhost list /Search/Users
# dscl localhost read /Search/Users/leggett
</pre>
</p><p>
Here we use the /Search directory, which acts on all enabled
directories. So, if you have local users in a NetInfo directory and
also LDAP users, the /Search acts on both of those directories,
merging the results for display. The second example uses the read action
to show the detailed information of the leaf of the branch specified,
/Search/Users/leggett in this case. The dscl utility can be helpful when
all you have is console access to your OS X machine.
</p><p>
Having verified that our LDAP users are available, we need to create local
home directories for the LDAP users we've just enabled:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# install -d -o leggett /Users/leggett
# ln -sf /Users /home
</pre>
</p><p>
OS X v10.4 has some finer-grained policies than standard POSIX access for
controlling access to certain aspects of the OS. By default, members of
the group admin have administrator privileges. However, this group is
locally stored in each machine's NetInfo directory, and I've been told
it's very bad to remove or rename this group. You also can't override
this group with an LDAP group named admin, because the search order for
directories always searches the local NetInfo directory first. To use
an LDAP group to replace the local group role, you need to edit the
file /etc/authorization. This is a standard Apple plist-formatted file,
and it defines roles for different aspects of the system. If you change
lines that look like:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;key&gt;group&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;admin&lt;/string&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a3f580.0x1b2fd88"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;key&gt;group&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;ldap-admins&lt;/string&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a3f580.0x1b2fee8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
for the different rights, you'll enable those users in the ldap-admins
group to be administrators on that machine. These rights are different
from sudo privileges, which are defined in /etc/sudoers. These rights
control rights to tasks such as installing software and modifying system
preferences.
</p><p>
At this point we should be able to log in as user leggett. Tiger's sshd
supports both GSSAPI mechanisms, gssapi and gssapi-with-mic. Previous OS X
versions supported only gssapi, so a password was required when logging
in to or from an OS X client. SSO support is enabled out of the box for
sshd, so there's no config files to edit.
</p><p>
As I stated earlier, with v10.4, almost all of OS X's built-in services
and applications are Kerberized, including Apple's Mail.app. If you're
running your own CA or using self-signed certificates, you need to
import your CA's certificate into the System keychain first, so Mail.app
won't complain when connecting to self-signed SSL-enabled services like
IMAP and SMTP. Copy the CA cert to the OS X client and then run certtool:

<pre     class="programlisting">

sudo certtool i ci-cert.pem v \
 k=/System/Library/Keychains/X509Anchors

</pre>
</p><p>
Now you're ready to start Mail.app. The trick to enabling GSSAPI during
the account creation process is to fill in the user name and leave the
password blank. If you don't already have valid credentials, it will
prompt you for your Kerberos password. Once the account is created, go
back and enable SSL for IMAP. By default it's not enabled, and Mail.app
doesn't give you the choice at account creation time.
</p><p>
All versions of OS X since v10.3 ship with a GUI application for managing
Kerberos credentials named Kerberos.app (Figure 4), but it's buried in
/System/Library/CoreServices. You can add this useful app to your dock
and have it start at boot. It can automatically renew your
credentials when they're expiring and easily show you how much longer
your credentials are valid, among other useful features.

Wrapping Up</h2></div></div><p>
By now you're probably starting to realize the enormous potential of
LDAP directories and Kerberos authentication. You have a powerful and
scalable infrastructure as well as clients making full use of it. In my
next article, we'll discuss how to integrate in one more type of client,
Microsoft Windows. Until then, enjoy the fruits of your labor!
