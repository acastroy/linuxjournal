IO Channels, a feature of the Glib library, make
portable I/O simple and efficient. In this article, Robert shows how.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x235e580.0x2456348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Glib's IO Channels provide several powerful features:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Buffered I/O: as with C's Standard Library, IO Channels
provide user-side buffering, which minimizes the number of system call
invocations and ensures that I/O is performed in optimally sized units.
</p></li><li><p>
Portability: IO Channels are portable, working in various UNIX
systems as well as Windows.
</p></li><li><p>
Simple yet efficient I/O routines: helper routines to make
common programming chores, such as &ldquo;read exactly one line&rdquo;
or &ldquo;read the
whole file&rdquo; easy.
</p></li><li><p>
Main loop integration: integration into the Glib main loop
means multiplexed I/O and event-driven programming is easy.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Although designed for powerful and complex GNOME applications, Glib is
actually a separate library from GNOME and readily usable from any
C application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x235e580.0x2456870"></a>
Main Loops</h2></div></div><p>
A main loop, sometimes called an event loop, allows a
single-threaded process to wait for and handle events originating from
multiple sources. Most GUI programmers are familiar with main loops:
they allow event-driven GUI programming to register callback functions
that are invoked in response to events, such as a button press or window
close. The Gtk+ main loop is built on top of Glib's main loop.
</p><p>
The Glib main loop is implemented using multiplexing I/O&mdash;in Linux,
via the poll() system call. Events are associated with file
descriptors, which are watched via poll(). In this manner, the
application need not check incessantly for new events but can sleep,
consuming no processor time, so long as there is no activity.
</p><p>
Glib's main loop associates a callback function with each event. When
the event occurs, the main loop will call back into the given
function. Callbacks are invoked in the order that their associated
event occurs, although priority may be given to events to change this
order. Because multiple events may be watched and multiple callback
functions registered, even a single-threaded process can juggle numerous
events.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x235e580.0x2456a28"></a>
Glib</h2></div></div><p>
The Glib library is GNOME's base library, providing portability
wrappers and a set of helper functions to make programming in C less
arduous. Although part of GNOME, Glib is very much usable on its own,
and many non-GNOME projects do indeed utilize Glib without touching
any other parts of GNOME. In fact, Glib is even beneficial to console
applications. This article makes no assumptions about the use of other
GNOME components; the interfaces covered work equally well in a
complex GNOME application and a simple console program.
</p><p>
Compiling an application with the requisite Glib support is made easy
by the pkg-config program. You can build a binary gio
from the source file gio.c with the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">

gcc -Wall -O2 \
        `pkg-config --cflags --libs glib-2.0` \
        -o gio \
        gio.c

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x235e580.0x2456be0"></a>
IO Channels</h2></div></div><p>
An IO Channel is represented by the GIOChannel data structure. Its
fields are private, and it is accessed using only the official IO Channel
interfaces.
</p><p>
Each IO Channel is associated with a single file or other
&ldquo;file-like&rdquo;
object. On Linux, an IO Channel can be associated with any open file
descriptor, including sockets and pipes. Once associated, the IO Channel
is used to access the file.
</p><p>
Watches are created against a given IO Channel, along with a
set of events on which to wait for and a callback function to invoke in
response. The watches then integrate with Glib's main loop. When an event
occurs&mdash;say, a socket has new data available for reading&mdash;the watch is
triggered and the callback is automatically invoked.
</p><p>
The watch lies at the heart of the power of IO Channels: applications can
create multiple watches and integrate them, along with numerous other
events, into the Glib main loop, providing event-driven programming to
even simple single-threaded applications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x235e580.0x2456e48"></a>
Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>
Listing 1 is a complete and working console application that uses IO
Channels to communicate across two pipes. It creates two IO Channels,
one for the read side of the pipe and another for the write side of the
pipe. It then registers watches for these two IO Channels. One watch
invokes a callback, gio_in(), when the pipe is available for
reading (that is, when a read from the read side of the pipe will not
block). The other watch invokes a callback, gio_out(), when the
pipe is available for writing (that is, when a write to the write side
of the pipe will not block). The gio_out() callback writes a
small message into the pipe. The gio_in() callback reads the
available data from the pipe and prints it to standard out.

</pre></div><p>
To be sure, this is an example rooted solely in explanation. It is
silly to operate a pipe like this in a single application. Further,
the program will continually read from and write to the pipe (you can
kill the process with Ctrl-C). Nonetheless, this example serves
a good purpose: it demonstrates event-driven programming and the utility
of a main loop multiplexing I/O. The natural extension of this program
would be to separate it into two processes, a consumer and a producer,
and actually communicate interprocess over the pipe. Add a handful of
other IO Channels, some GUI events, a few timers, and so on, to the main
loop, and you will have a real program!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x235e580.0x2457160"></a>
Creating an IO Channel</h2></div></div><p>
There are two ways to create a new IO Channel. The easiest method creates
the IO Channel from an existing open file descriptor. The file descriptor
can map to any object, including sockets and pipes:

<pre     class="programlisting">
GIOChannel *gio;

gio = g_io_channel_unix_new (fd);
if (!gio)
        g_error ("Error creating new GIOChannel!\n");
</pre>
</p><p>
As its name suggests, this function is UNIX-specific. Another method is
available for creating an IO Channel in a platform-independent manner:

<pre     class="programlisting">

GIOChannel *gio;
GError *err = NULL;

gio = g_io_channel_new_file ("/etc/passwd"
                             "r",
                             &amp;err);
if (!gio)
        g_error ("Error creating new GIOChannel: %s\n",
                 err-&gt;msg);

</pre>
</p><p>
The second parameter specifies the mode with which to open the file:
one of r, w, r+, w+, a or a+. These values have the same
meaning as with fopen(). For example, in this code snippet,
we are asking to create a read-only IO Channel.
</p><p>
In our example program in Listing 1, we create two IO Channels using
g_io_channel_unix_new(), one for each end of the pipe.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x235e580.0x2457420"></a>
Creating a Watch</h2></div></div><p>
Given an IO Channel, creating a watch is easy:

<pre     class="programlisting">
guint ret;

ret = g_io_add_watch (gio, G_IO_IN, callback, NULL);
if (!ret)
        g_error ("Error creating watch!\n");
</pre>
</p><p>
The first parameter, gio, is the IO Channel we want to watch. The
second parameter is a mask of one or more conditions for which to
watch. The condition G_IO_IN is true when there is data to be
read without blocking. Other conditions are G_IO_OUT (data can
be written without blocking), G_IO_PRI (urgent data is available
to read), G_IO_ERR (an error occurred) and G_IO_HUP
(the connection was hung up). The third parameter is the callback function
that the Glib main loop will invoke when the event occurs.
</p><p>
Watch callbacks take the following form:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gboolean callback (GIOChannel *gio,
                   GIOCondition condition,
                   gpointer data);
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x235e580.0x2457688"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where gio is the applicable IO Channel, condition is a
bitmask of the triggered events and data is the last argument
given to g_io_add_watch().
</p><p>
If the return value of the callback is FALSE, the watch is
automatically removed.
</p><p>
In our example program in Listing 1, we create two watches, one for each
of our IO Channels.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x235e580.0x2457840"></a>
Reading from an IO Channel</h2></div></div><p>
The Glib library provides three basic interfaces for reading from an
IO Channel.
</p><p>
The first, g_io_channel_read_chars(), is used to read a specific
number of characters from an IO Channel into a pre-allocated buffer:

<pre     class="programlisting">
GIOStatus g_io_read_chars (GIOChannel *channel,
                           gchar *buf,
                           gsize count,
                           gsize *bytes_read,
                           GError **error);
</pre>
</p><p>
This function reads up to <span   class="emphasis"><em>count</em></span> bytes from the IO Channel
channel into the buffer buf. Upon successful return,
bytes_read will point to the number of bytes actually read. On
failure, error will point to a GError structure.
</p><p>
The return value is an integer with one of four values:
G_IO_STATUS_ERROR (an error occurred), G_IO_STATUS_NORMAL
(success), G_IO_STATUS_EOF (end-of-file was reached) or
G_IO_STATUS_AGAIN (resource temporarily unavailable, try again).
</p><p>
The second interface, g_io_channel_read_line(), is used to
read an entire line from a given IO Channel. It will not return until
a newline-delimited line is read:

<pre     class="programlisting">
GIOStatus
g_io_channel_read_line (GIOChannel *channel,
                        gchar **str_return,
                        gsize *length,
                        gsize *terminator_pos,
                        GError **error);
</pre>
</p><p>
Upon successful return, str_return will contain a
pointer to a newly allocated block of memory of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>length</em></span>
bytes. terminator_pos is the offset into str_return
of the terminating character. The data returned by this function must
be freed via a call to g_free().
</p><p>
The final interface, g_io_channel_read_to_end(), reads all
remaining data from the file into the given buffer:

<pre     class="programlisting">
GIOStatus g_io_channel_read_to_end (GIOChannel *channel,
                                    gchar **str_return,
                                    gsize *length,
                                    GError **error);
</pre>
</p><p>
Upon successful return, str_return will contain a pointer to a
newly allocated block of memory of length bytes, which must be
freed via g_free().
</p><p>
This function should not be used on IO Channels that map to file
descriptors that do not necessarily return end-of-file when exhausted of
data. For example, we could not use this function in our example program,
because pipes do not return end-of-file until the other side has closed
its end of the connection. Thus, our example would block indefinitely
if we use g_io_channel_read_to_end().
</p><p>
Instead, in our example, we use g_io_channel_read_line() to read
an entire line from the pipe.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x235e580.0x2763ea8"></a>
Writing to an IO Channel</h2></div></div><p>
Glib provides a single interface for writing to an IO Channel:

<pre     class="programlisting">
GIOStatus
g_io_channel_write_chars (GIOChannel *channel,
                          const gchar *buf,
                          gssize count,
                          gsize *bytes_written,
                          GError **error);
</pre>
</p><p>
A successful call to g_io_channel_write_chars() will write up to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>count</em></span> bytes from the buffer pointed at by buf into the
file represented by the IO Channel channel. If count
is negative one, buf will be treated as a NULL-delimited
string. On return, bytes_written contains the actual number of
bytes written.
</p><p>
Like C's Standard I/O Library, IO Channels perform buffered
I/O to optimize performance. Thus, a write request may
not actually be submitted to the kernel after each call to
g_io_channel_write_chars(). Instead, glib may wait until a
sufficiently large buffer is full and then submit the write request,
in one large swoop.
</p><p>
The g_io_channel_flush() function is used to force a submission
of any pending write requests to the kernel:

<pre     class="programlisting">
GIOStatus
g_io_channel_flush (GIOChannel *channel,
                    GError **error);
</pre>
</p><p>
Buffering can be turned off altogether, if so desired:

<pre     class="programlisting">
g_io_channel_set_encoding (gio, NULL, NULL);
g_io_channel_set_buffered (gio, FALSE);
</pre>
</p><p>
The second function disables buffering. The first sets the IO Channel's
encoding to NULL, which is required for disabling buffering.
</p><p>
In our example program, we use g_io_channel_write_chars() to
write a small string to the pipe. We do not mess with the buffering of
the IO Channel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x235e580.0x2764320"></a>
Seeking Around an IO Channel</h2></div></div><p>
As a file is written to or read from, Glib automatically updates the
application's position within the file. When a file is first opened,
the position is set to the start. Read four bytes, and the position is
subsequently set to the fifth byte. This is the file I/O behavior nearly
all developers are familiar with.
</p><p>
Sometimes, however, an application wants to seek around the file on its
own. For that, Glib provides a single function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
GIOStatus
g_io_channel_seek_position (GIOChannel *channel,
                            gint64 offset,
                            GSeekType type,
                            GError **error);
</pre>
</p><p>
A successful call will change the current position in the file as
described by offset and type.
</p><p>
The type parameter is one of G_SEEK_CUR,
G_SEEK_SET or G_SEEK_END.
G_SEEK_CUR asks that the file's position be updated to
offset bytes from the current position.
G_SEEK_SET asks that the file's position be set to
offset. Thus, the following code sets the file position to the
start of the file:

<pre     class="programlisting">

GIOStatus ret;
GError err;

ret = g_io_channel_seek_position (gio,
                                  0,
                                  G_SEEK_SET,
                                  &amp;err);
if (ret)
        g_error ("Error seeking: %s\n",
                 err-&gt;message);

</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, G_SEEK_END asks that the file's position be set to
offset bytes from the end of the file.
</p><p>
We do not use g_io_channel_seek_position() in our sample
application, because even if we had a reason to, pipes are not seekable.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x235e580.0x2764690"></a>
Closing an IO Channel</h2></div></div><p>
When done with an IO Channel, it is destroyed and the file is closed
via a call to g_io_channel_shutdown:

<pre     class="programlisting">
GIOStatus
g_io_channel_shutdown (GIOChannel *channel,
                       gboolean flush,
                       GError **err);
</pre>
</p><p>
If flush is TRUE, any pending I/O is first flushed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x235e580.0x2764848"></a>
Deprecated Functions</h2></div></div><p>
Several older IO Channel functions are provided by Glib:
g_io_channel_read(), g_io_channel_write() and
g_io_channel_seek(). The functions discussed in this article
have replaced these older, deprecated functions and should be used
instead. Particularly, <span   class="emphasis"><em>never</em></span> mix these old functions with the
other functions on the same IO Channel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x235e580.0x27649a8"></a>
Putting It All Together</h2></div></div><p>
We have now covered all of the IO Channel interfaces used in Listing
1. Only two details go unexplained. First, in our example program,
we create a pipe in the usual manner:

<pre     class="programlisting">
int fd[2], ret;

ret = pipe (fd);
if (ret)
        g_error ("Creating pipe failed: %s\n",
                 strerror (errno));
</pre>
</p><p>
Second, our main() function initializes the Glib main loop, calls
our function to initialize the IO Channels and then runs the main loop:

<pre     class="programlisting">
int
main (void)
{
        GMainLoop *loop;

        loop = g_main_loop_new (NULL, FALSE);
        init_channels ();
        g_main_loop_run (loop);    /* Wheee! */
        return 0;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
The g_main_loop_new() function creates a new main loop and
returns a pointer to a new GMainLoop structure. Once ready to
start the main loop running, we call g_main_loop_run() and let
Glib handle the rest.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Applications that use IO Channels combine a portable multiplexed I/O
solution with smart buffering and Glib main loop integration. The result
is a solution that allows applications to juggle I/O among hundreds
of file descriptors. A graphical network client can manage all of its
open sockets, handle new connections seamlessly, juggle a dozen open
files and respond to numerous GUI events from a single place and with
a single thread.
</p><p>
Glib's IO Channels make I/O easy, efficient, and&mdash;gasp&mdash;even fun!
