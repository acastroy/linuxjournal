How to unclutter your $HOME or even your whole disk and keep it
uncluttered.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21a6580.0x229e3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
That's very amusing, Fran&ccedil;ois. I can't remember when I've I laughed so
much. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi?</em></span> I'm sorry, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>, I did not realize that you
were serious. It's true that most people will tell you that their home
is a money pit, but that is not the reason the environment variable for a
user's home directory is $HOME. The dollar sign in front of the
variable name is simply how these things are accessed by the shell. Now,
don't look so sad, Fran&ccedil;ois. It really was very funny, and if I were you,
I would write that down and use it someday.
</p><p>
Since you mentioned it, however, your $HOME can become expensive
in other ways. People always seem to be able to find some
kind of construction project for their homes, whether it be remodeling
a bathroom, updating a kitchen or building a new deck. So it seems
to be a similar case when running their Linux systems. I'm guilty of it myself,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mon
ami</em></span>. During the course of any given year, I download hundreds of packages
that I compile and install. Sometimes, I uninstall them and sometimes
I forget about them, deleting the source folder and its accompanying
uninstall scripts. The result is unused programs, forgotten programs
and hanging files without a purpose. Because most Linux software is free,
your Linux home isn't a money pit, but it can be a messy pit. All of this
fits in nicely with tonight's menu.
</p><p>
We'll talk later, Fran&ccedil;ois&mdash;the door is opening and our guests are
arriving. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite!</em></span> Direct them to their tables. Welcome, everyone,
to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, home of the finest in Linux fare, not to mention the
world's greatest wine cellar. Fran&ccedil;ois will show you to your tables, and
then he will fetch the wine. I believe the 2003 Clarendon Hills Brookman
Syrah is already drinking well. Fran&ccedil;ois, you will find a case in the
East wing of the cellar.
</p><p>
Those of you who visit <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span> on a regular basis are very
familiar with the extract-and-build five-step. As a quick recap, let's
consider a package called ftl-drive-3.1.tar.gz. To build and
install the package using the extract-and-build five-step, you would
use the following commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf ftl-drive-3.1.tar.gz
cd ftl-drive-3.1
./configure
make
su -c "make install"
</pre>
</p><p>
This tends to work quite well, and if you decide that this package doesn't
do what you want it to do, or that you no longer need it on the system,
the way to install it is to go back into the source directory and type
the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
su -c "make uninstall"
</pre>
</p><p>
Sounds simple enough, except that many source packages do not include an
uninstall script. This is what makes package managers like RPM or DEB
so much nicer, and it's why I suggest that you look for precompiled packages
whenever possible. The package managers keep track of what files were
installed where and handle the messy process of removing everything that
makes up an installed package. It would be truly fantastic if you could
do the same with source packages. That's where Felipe Eduardo S&aacute;nchez
D&iacute;az Dur&aacute;n's CheckInstall comes into play. To get your copy,
go to the CheckInstall Web site (see the on-line Resources). Source is available
(though you likely won't need it),
as well as RPM, DEB and Slackware packages.
The advantage of the binary packages
(other than simplicity) is that they are already configured for your
distribution's package manager. Why is this important? Keep reading.
</p><p>
CheckInstall makes it possible to generate
DEB or RPM packages from source code bundles. The idea is that you
run the first four steps of the extract-and-build five-step and run
the <tt  >checkinstall</tt> program instead of the final
<tt  >su -c
"make install"</tt>. Because the result is a precompiled package, your
system's package manager takes care of the installation and removal
of the packages. Let's pretend that you already have gone through the
extract of a source package, right through to the
<tt  >make</tt>
stage. Now,
type the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
su -c "checkinstall"
</pre>
</p><p>
The first time you run checkinstall, you will get the following message:

<pre     class="programlisting">
The package documentation directory ./doc-pak does not exist.
Should I create a default set of package docs?  [y]:
</pre>
</p><p>
The correct answer here is y, or simply press Enter to accept the
default. The next step puts together the documentation package. In some
cases, you may get a message that no documentation was included with
the package. There's no need to worry if this happens. Just before
things really start happening here, you'll be asked for a description
of the package. As I write this, I am using CheckInstall with a kids'
concentration game I found (see Resources), so my description looks
something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

Please write a description for the package.
End your description with an empty line or EOF.
&gt;&gt; Concentration game for kids

**************************************
**** RPM package creation selected ***
**************************************

This package will be built according to these values:

1 -  Summary: [ Concentration game for kids ]
2 -  Name:    [ concentration ]
3 -  Version: [ 1.1 ]
4 -  Release: [ 1 ]
5 -  License: [ GPL ]
6 -  Group:   [ checkinstall ]
7 -  Architecture: [ i386 ]
8 -  Source location: [ concentration-1.1 ]
9 -  Alternate source location: [  ]
10 - Requires: [  ]
11 - Provides: [ concentration ]

Enter a number to change any of them or press ENTER to continue:

</pre>
</p><p>
Once you pass this point, a lot of information will fly
past you on the screen, followed by the creation of the RPM package
itself. Assuming everything worked out well, you should see a message
similar to the one I received when building the above game:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Done. The new package has been saved to

 /usr/src/RPM/RPMS/i386/concentration-1.1-1.i386.rpm
 You can install it in your system anytime using:

      rpm -i concentration-1.1-1.i386.rpm
</pre>
</p><p>
Should you decide that you want to uninstall this package, the standard
RPM tools will do the trick, either graphically or with the command
line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -e concentration
</pre>
</p><p>
For those who prefer to avoid the command line
whenever possible, you might want to check out Ingo Stieran's
KInstaller, an install program geared specifically
to KDE. You can get a copy of KInstaller from the Web site (see
Resources). It's kind
of interesting that building a package to avoid the command
line is done at the command line, but this is a pretty straightforward
(you guessed it) extract-and-build five-step.
</p><p>
When you first start the program, you are treated to a setup wizard
(Figure 1). Because this is essentially an installation tool for other
KDE programs, your first step is to identify the KDE base directory. The
easiest thing to do here is to click the Guess button. The field you
should pay more attention to, however, is Storage dir. By default,
KInstaller needs to know where you are going to extract and perform the
installs for your packages. That directory is /tmp, but that
may not be the best choice for everyone. Because I do a lot of package
testing, I have a rather large partition, /mnt/bigdrive, that I
use exclusively for this purpose. Choose something appropriate for your
system. Finally, look at the check box labeled Move source packages
to storage directory after installation. If you want to keep a copy of
your source packages, check this box before continuing.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8624f1.large.jpg"><img src="8624f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. KInstaller starts with a simple configuration wizard.
</p></div></div><p>
When you click Finish, KInstaller starts. You'll see a two-tabbed window
with the Installation tab selected by default. Near the top is a field
labeled Select, which you will use to navigate to a source package. Once
you press the Install button, the log window below starts filling up
with the details of the build, from extraction to compilation (Figure
2). It's all done automagically. When the compilation completes, the install
process launches and you'll get a pop-up box asking you to enter the
root password.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8624f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. KInstaller handles every step of the extract-and-build five-step.
</p></div></div><p>
Once you have done a few of these, take a moment to look at those tabs
again, and you'll see that one of them is labeled Uninstallation. Every
package you have installed using KInstaller will have an entry here. To
uninstall the package (regardless of whether an uninstall script was
provided), select the package you want removed from the list and click
the Uninstall button. Once again, a pop-up window will ask you for the
root password to go ahead and remove the package. KInstaller does all
this without using checkinstall. The package tracks installs on its
own. It is also, as I mentioned earlier, geared to KDE packages.
</p><p>
While Fran&ccedil;ois attends to what appears to be an unusually large
number of empty glasses&mdash;it seems, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, that you are
enjoying the wine as much as I am&mdash;I would like to show you another
package in the style of KInstaller. Check out Javier Campos Morales'
KConfigure. KConfigure isn't geared specifically to KDE packages, despite the very KDE-ish sounding name. What makes this package
interesting is the way it handles the process of uninstalling software;
it uses our old friend, checkinstall.
</p><p>
To start working with KConfigure, visit the Web site at SourceForge (see
Resources). Source is available (and yes,
it is a simple extract-and-build five-step). When you run the program,
a basic two-paned window appears with a small number of icons running
along the top. The icons have familiar-sounding names like Configure,
Make and Install.
</p><p>
This is where things get interesting, so let's pause for a
moment and look at KConfigure's configuration menu (Figure 3). I'll
let you explore the Fonts and Miscellaneous settings on your own. For now, I want
to concentrate on the Check Install Settings. To use the checkinstall
program, click the Use Checkinstall check box and make sure you have the
right path to the checkinstall executable (on my system, it resides in
/usr/bin). I make a point of mentioning this since the default
entered by KConfigure is /usr/sbin. When you are happy with
your settings, click OK.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8624f3.large.jpg"><img src="8624f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. KConfigure's settings allow you to use checkinstall to build packages.
</p></div></div><p>
Time to build a package. Click Open and select a source
bundle. KConfigure now shows you a window with a listing of the files
that are about to be extracted. The default directory for the extract
and build is the directory from which you selected the bundle, but you can
override that by clicking the Extract files in... radio button and
selecting another location. Click OK when you are happy with your choice, and a few seconds later a dialog box will inform you that the package
was extracted successfully. Now you are ready to click the Configure
button. A log of the configure process appears in the top-half window
with any errors displayed in the bottom half. The same display format
applies when you finally click the Make button (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8624f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Details, details&mdash;a KConfigure build displays the work happening in the background.
</p></div></div><p>
Once the configure and make process has completed, you could just go
ahead and click Install. Assuming that you have checkinstall and that you
want to use it, make sure that you click Build on the menu bar and select
Check Install from the Install With submenu. Now, go ahead and click
Install. A prompt appears asking you to confirm the root password
before continuing. After doing so, the RPM package is created. Make
sure you check the bottom of the log window where the path to your
newly created RPM package will be. On my system, that was:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/src/RPM/RPMS/i386/concentration-1.1-1.kcfg.i386.rpm
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon Dieu!</em></span> The time has come and gone so quickly, and it is already
closing time. Surely there must be an open-source programmer somewhere
working on a program to extend time. We could even use one of the
tools covered today to build and install the package,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non?</em></span> In
the meantime, we shall have to live with the clocks we have. Besides,
