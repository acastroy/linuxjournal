Use Asterisk and Digium to give all your family members their own
phone extension and voice mail.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af6580.0x1bee2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Some open-source projects have a certain perverse economic madness about
them. For example, as I wrote about last month, you can use
$600&ndash;$700 US worth of hardware and MythTV to re-create the TiVo
box you can get at Best Buy for half the price. Of course, there are
philosophical and technical reasons for wanting to use MythTV,
but for most of the general public, it really doesn't make sense.
</p><p>
On the other hand, you occasionally run across an open-source product
that is, in fact, a much cheaper solution than the commercial offerings
in the same space. One example is Asterisk, which bills itself as the
open-source PBX. A PBX, for those not in the know, is a Private Branch
Exchange. It's essentially a mini-phone company inside a business or
(as in our example here) a home. A certain number of outside lines come
into the building, but there can be many more individual extensions that
can call each other or request an outside line. Anyone who's worked at
a company of even moderate size should be familiar with the concept
(dial 9 to get an outside line&mdash;ring any bells?).
</p><p>
Unfortunately, as handy as PBXes are, they are also mucho dinero.
Thankfully, Asterisk can provide a full-function PBX with voice mail and
even VoIP bridging, without breaking the bank. It's cheap enough that it
even makes sense in a residential setting, assuming your home is large
enough that you spend half your time shouting at the spouse to pick up
the phone. With that in mind, let's see how you might set up Asterisk in
a home environment.
</p><p>
To begin, you'll need a garden-variety Linux server with a spare PCI
slot. Asterisk has been reported to have performance issues running
with the X Window System, so you'll probably want to dedicate a server just for
the purpose. You don't need an absolute speed demon of a box, but
low-balling your processor probably isn't a great idea either. You'll
need some disk space to store voice mail, but Asterisk is fairly
efficient at compressing sound, so a 40GB drive should be more than
enough for the OS, swap and voice data.

Phone Calls Are in the Cards for You</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8591f1.large.jpg"><img src="8591f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The TDM400P provides four ports to mix and match between external
lines and extensions.
</p></div></div><p>
You will need one piece of specialized hardware, a Digium Wildcard
TDM400P. This card allows you to hook traditional handsets and POTS
(plain-old telephone service) lines to your server. It's what Asterisk
uses to receive and send calls over the phone network, and to ring the
various PBX lines inside the house. A TDM400P has four available
ports&mdash;you can mix and match them between outside lines and internal handsets.
 So, for example, you could configure it to have one outside line and
three
internal lines. You need to order the card with the mix you want; you
can't change a line from outside to inside. Fully loaded, the cards go
for about $250 US retail. Basically, to figure out how many you'll need,
add up the number of outside lines you have or intend to get plus the
number of internal extensions you plan to provision (you can have more
than one handset on a single extension), then divide by four. So, two
outside lines plus six extensions would be eight ports, or two cards. In a
corporate setting, you'd probably be bringing in your outside lines via
a T1 line, and Digium makes cards for that purpose as well, but since
you're probably not running a call center out of your Tudor
mini-mansion, the TDM400P will probably be all you need.
</p><p>
At this point, you need to set up your OS and the Asterisk software. I
know the almost irresistible temptation is to install your favorite
distro and then try to install the Zaptel drivers needed for the TDM400P
and the Asterisk software from source. Resist, resist! I spent a good
three days trying to get things working that way. First I couldn't get the
drivers running right, then I had to configure udev support for those
Zaptel devices, then spend a good day poring over the available
documentation for Asterisk trying to get the software to talk to the
card. I even had an engineer from Digium logged in to my system poking
around for an hour, and he couldn't get it to work either. (This, by
the way, is a really nice service offered by Digium to folks who
purchase their cards; they'll assist in the setup and basic
configuration of an Asterisk system.)

Feeling @Home with Asterisk</h2></div></div><p>
Finally, I saw the light (possibly stars brought on by repeated pounding
of my head on the desk), and downloaded the ISO of Asterisk@Home, a
complete Linux distribution that comes up running right out of the box.
 An initial caveat: the install procedure is extremely automatic, to the
extent that it will repartition and reformat your disk without a second
glance. This is definitely not something you want to &ldquo;trial
install&rdquo;
 on
a machine with important data sitting on it.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8591f2.large.jpg"><img src="8591f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Asterisk@Home Main Screen
</p></div></div><p>
Once the install is finished (about 20 minutes on a fast machine), you
should be able to browse (from another machine) to a newly installed Web
server on your Asterisk host. Clicking on the Asterisk Management
Portal link brings you to the main AMP screen. From here, you can set
up your entire PBX using a well-documented and simple-to-use GUI interface.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8591f3.large.jpg"><img src="8591f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Adding an Extension
</p></div></div><p>
For example, adding an extension is as simple as a couple mouse
clicks. In Figure 3, we're associating port 1 on the Digium
card with extension 10. We also can configure the voice-mail options at
the same time. Recording automated voice response messages is just a
matter of calling an extension from one of the system phones and talking.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8591f4.large.jpg"><img src="8591f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Configuring Incoming Calls
</p></div></div><p>
Incoming calls can be routed to a set of phones or to an operator. You
also can set different rules for business and after-hours calls.
Certain lines can be restricted from making long-distance phone calls
or even from calling outside the house at all. Asterisk@Home also comes with
an application called Flash Operator Panel, which lets authorized
users see which lines are in use, transfer calls to different
extensions and generally perform the functions normally handled by a
receptionist at a company. It's probably overkill for a simple home
application, but it comes as part of the package and may prove useful on
occasion.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8591f5.large.jpg"><img src="8591f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Using the Operator Panel, you can drop and drag phone calls.

The Bottom Line</h2></div></div><p>
Asterisk can seem like a foreboding project to undertake, if you make
the mistake of reading the manual and trying to do it yourself. But
with some relatively inexpensive hardware and the right Linux
distribution, you can have a home PBX screening your calls in less than an hour.
