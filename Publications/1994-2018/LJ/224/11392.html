Our old enemy was proprietary platforms. Should it now be proprietary data?

Turns out maps matter.
</p><p>
That's always been the case for me. I'm a map freak. I own hundreds of
paper maps in various specialties, plus many atlases, books on geography,
geology and other geo-obsessions. But I'm no longer an edge case, because
maps are proving to be essential on smartphones, which today approaches a
billion or more people. Digital maps on phones are now among the core
portfolio of smartphone apps, alongside voice, text, calendar and contacts.
What could be more mobile about a phone than a map to help the user look
things up and get around?
</p><p>
In appearance and function, smartphone maps evolved from standalone GPS
units, which were limited to location lookup and turn-by-turn directions in
both text and voice form. But maps on phones grew much deeper, because
boundless amounts of memory, intelligence and usage-based heuristics could
be located in the cloud, and delivered to the app and the user through an
API over a live data connection.
</p><p>
Nobody has done more with cloud-based mapping than Google. By the middle of
this year, Google-made or -based map apps were the primary sources of
location and navigation information for users carrying all kinds of mobile
devices&mdash;especially Android and Apple mobile devices. Among
smartphones, that pair alone comprised about a 90% market share in the US.
</p><p>
In September 2012, however, Apple released iOS 6 and the iPhone 5, both with a
new Maps app that did not use Google as a data source. The new Google-free
Maps app quickly turned into Apple's worst fail since the Newton. Initial
sales of the iPhone 5 were good, as were installs of iOS 6. But then came
reports of the new Maps app's disabilities, which were extreme. Missing
were countless major points of interest, such as the entire subway systems
of New York, London and Paris. Museums were moved into rivers. Dead
businesses came to life, and live businesses went away. At the time of this writing (in
early October 2012), iPhone 5 sales projections have been revised downward, and
Apple's stock is dipping as well. The map debacle may not be the only
reason, but it's still a big one.
</p><p>
Why would Apple do something so obviously harmful to itself? Because Google
was clearly withholding essential mapping features from iOS to favor
Android, and Apple needed to rid itself of a clearly hostile supplier. As
an owner of both Android and Apple phones, that much was obvious to me. But
news of it didn't make the mainstream press (at least as far as I know)
until David Pogue reported as much in his <span   class="emphasis"><em>New York
Times</em></span> column of
September 27, 2012
(<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/technology/personaltech/apples-new-maps-app-is-upgraded-but-full-of-snags-review.html?_r=0" target="_self">www.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/technology/personaltech/apples-new-maps-app-is-upgraded-but-full-of-snags-review.html?_r=0</a>):

After poking around, here's what I've learned.
</p><p>
First, why Apple dropped the old version: Google, it says, was saving all
the best features for phones that run its Android software. For example,
the iPhone app never got spoken directions or vector maps (smooth lines,
not tiles of pixels), long after those features had come to rival phones.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Apple has a variety of replacement data sources, starting with TomTom, the
Netherlands-based maker of navigation (mostly GPS) systems. TomTom's
primary data source is its Tele-Atlas subsidiary, which it acquired for
2.9 billion euros in 2008. The prior year, Nokia acquired Navteq, Tele-Atlas'
main competitor, for 5.7 billion euros. Google used Tele-Atlas as a source
until October 2009, when it became its own primary data source.
</p><p>
Google, Navteq and Tele-Atlas all deploy special vehicles on streets to
create, correct and enhance mapping. In Google's case, this also
has included mapping of Wi-Fi access points to fine-tune a user's
location further. Microsoft, Google and Apple also have aerial views provided both
by satellites and low-flying aircraft. And all are feeding their clouds and
crunching up data gathered by watching what users do.
</p><p>
At this point, it would be easy to digress into vendor sports and handicap
which of the map data sources and mobile device suppliers will win in the
marketplace. But instead, I want to look at what all this says about
dependencies. What we see here is the replacement of the platform with the
Big Data API&mdash;let's call it a BiGDAPI&mdash;as a single source of
market-making and market-breaking dependency.
</p><p>
Google's passive-aggressive map app game with Apple, and Apple's refusal to
keep playing it, are both evidence of Google's huge leverage through its
map BiGDAPI.
</p><p>
The term &ldquo;Big Data&rdquo; has been around for a long time, but has obtained
buzzphrase status only in the last two years. Although much that can be said about
Big Data is positive and harmless (better medicine, better science, better
analytic fodder for countless good purposes), one unspoken motivation
behind the buzz is obtaining high degrees of market leverage. And much of
that leverage is not in harmony with the constructive motivations and
practices behind free software, open source and Linux. Because, behind many
of the big APIs are vast jungles of exclusive and patent-protected
functionalities and restrictions around use. Such as, for example, the
spoken turn-by-turn directions Google wouldn't allow Apple to use. It can
be dispiriting to see platform leverage exceeded by large proprietary databases and exclusive services made available through APIs. But it's
important to bring attention to what's going on, so here we are.
</p><p>
We also should remember that good things come
from APIs. For exposing
organizational competencies in purely useful ways, nothing beats them. (For
a sample, take a look at the growing list of APIs at ProgrammableWeb.com:
<a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory" target="_self">www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory</a>.)
</p><p>
One hopeful force on the mapping front is OpenStreetMap.org, which has been
crowdsourcing maps data for years. It has an API too
(<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API" target="_self">wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API</a>). Perhaps in time, free
developers and users can best the sums of data currently locked up in
proprietary mapping bases, and the analytics as well. But until then, it's
helpful just to watch what's happening in the mapping space, and how
dependent we remain on proprietary companies and BiGDAPIs over which we
have little control.
