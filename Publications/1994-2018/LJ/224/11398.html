What has Reuven been reading? And, what should you be reading? It's time
to review this year's crop of technical books.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c4c580.0x1d44358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Once again, I'm dedicating my December 2012 column to a
review of the latest books (and other resources) that I've found
interesting, useful or just entertaining during the past year.
</p><p>
It continues to amaze me that despite the state of the global economy
in general, and of publishing in particular, we continue to enjoy a
large number of high-quality technology-related books each year. A
growing number of these books are being produced as e-books, rather
than printed copies, and many of them are being produced by
independent authors and small publishers, rather than the more-established
names in the publishing business. By paying attention to blogs,
forums and technology podcasts, you can learn about these independent
publications, which often are both low in price and high in quality.
(Of course, there also are some for which I've paid that turned
out to be not nearly as good as I had hoped.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c4c580.0x1d44568"></a>
Ruby</h2></div></div><p>
I spend a large part of my time developing software (as opposed to
consulting or training); thus, I'm always interested in improving
my techniques, learning more about the technologies I use on a
day-to-day basis and incorporating the latest ideas into my work. My
first-choice programming language continues to be Ruby, along with the
Ruby on Rails framework. For that reason, I'm happy to see that the
number of resources for Ruby programmers continues to grow. Once
again, The Pragmatic Programmers have led the way with a good number
of Ruby-related titles.
</p><p>
Several years ago, The Pragmatic Programmers came out with a book
called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Rails Recipes</em></span>, which contained all sorts of interesting,
bite-size ideas, suggestions and practical solutions for Rails
developers. This year, The Pragmatic Programmers released <span   class="emphasis"><em>Rails
Recipes: Rails 3 Edition</em></span>, which brings the book into the modern era
of Rails development. Some of the topics are simple or are well
documented elsewhere, such as setting a site's home page, model
versioning and sending e-mail with attachments. Other topics were, I
thought, descriptions of features that I hadn't seen elsewhere, such
as custom collection methods to ActiveRecord results and use of
composed_of. This book is useful for Rails developers of all
levels.
</p><p>
One of the biggest knocks against Ruby is its relatively slow
execution speed, and a second issue is the lack of serious threading. Both
of these problems are largely eliminated if you use JRuby, an
implementation of Ruby that uses JVM bytecodes. I haven't personally
used JRuby on very many projects, but there have been times when I
have needed or wanted to do so&mdash;and quite frankly, although programming
with JRuby isn't very different from the standard Ruby 1.9
interpreter, deploying is another story altogether. I haven't worked
with Java on a day-to-day basis for many years, so the array of
files, configurations and systems needed to take a JRuby program and
make it available to the world is a bit confusing for me.
</p><p>
Fortunately, the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Deploying with JRuby</em></span>, by Joe Kutner and
published by The Pragmatic Programmers, aims to fill this gap. It walks
you through the steps necessary to deploy a JRuby application
(including Rails applications written in JRuby). The book makes many
assumptions regarding how you want to deploy your server, using a
virtualized environment and Amazon's EC2. However, this is a common
enough pattern that I can understand the reasons for pointing
people in this direction, rather than individually configured servers.
</p><p>
Finally, the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Crafting Rails Applications</em></span>, written by Jose Valim
and also published by The Pragmatic Programmers, is a rare book aimed
at advanced Rails developers. I still haven't gone through it entirely,
but Valim presents a number of projects and programs in this
book, each of which exercises a different area of Rails that I didn't
personally feel like I understood well enough&mdash;for example, the
&ldquo;Metal&rdquo; interface for controllers. Even if I don't use the
knowledge gained from this book immediately, my deeper understanding of
Rails and how it works undoubtedly will be beneficial in my work,
helping me to debug existing applications and structure new ones.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c4c580.0x1d44988"></a>
JavaScript</h2></div></div><p>
Even the most die-hard Rails developer needs to know at least one
other language, namely JavaScript. JavaScript is, by some accounts,
the most widely deployed programming environment in the world, given
the incredibly large number of browsers that ship with it, on
computers of all shapes, sizes and makes. I still have issues with
the JavaScript language, but there's no avoiding its use in the modern
Web era, and there are many add-ons and frameworks that make its use more
palatable.
</p><p>
I was pleasantly surprised to see that O'Reilly has released a new
version of David Flanagan's classic book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>JavaScript: The Definitive
Reference</em></span>. I have had a copy, physical or virtual, of this book on
my shelf since its first edition was released, and although the physical
book has become almost unmanageably large at more than 1,000 pages, the
content continues to be useful. The book has been updated to include
some of the latest trends and libraries in the JavaScript world,
including jQuery, HTML5 (including such items as client-side storage
and Web sockets) and node.js. It's nice to know that I can continue
to rely on Flanagan's clear writing to teach (and just remind) me of
aspects of JavaScript that I need to know.
</p><p>
I often tell students in my classes that the problem with programming
today is not the development, but rather the maintenance. JavaScript,
with its extremely loose structure and lack of built-in systems for
modular code, makes it even easier for problems to occur. Thus, I was 
happy to see the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Maintainable JavaScript</em></span>, written by Nicholas
C. Zakas and published by O'Reilly. Many of the things that Zakas
writes are obvious to experienced JavaScript programmers, such as the
fact that you can use either single or double quotation marks to define
strings.
</p><p>
What is more useful and impressive is his collection of facts about
style guides and the implications of your choices&mdash;contrasting, for
example, the jQuery style guide (which prefers double quotation marks) and the
Google style guide (which suggests single quotation marks). I wish this
book had included a mention of CommonJS, which offers a standardized
system for modularizing and deploying JavaScript, an important aspect
of maintainable code. I also see this book as complementary to
Crockford's small but excellent book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>JavaScript: The Good
Parts</em></span>,
which was released a few years ago but still contains very useful information.
</p><p>
A new series written by Rails-veteran Noel Rappin and independently
published at his site (<a href="http://www.noelrappin.com" target="_self">www.noelrappin.com</a>) attempts to introduce
developers to JavaScript development, including the use of Backbone,
CoffeeScript and test-first development (TDD). The series isn't
complete as I write this, but I've enjoyed the parts I have read,
and I definitely have learned from it. I look forward to the
completion of part 3 and to the forthcoming part 4 as well.
</p><p>
Although I used to laugh at the idea of server-side JavaScript, node.js
clearly has become a force to be considered in the server-side
world.
I'm still not convinced that the node.js paradigm is one that is
appropriate for all sites, but there's no doubt that having a single
language in the browser and the server can be useful, and that the
speed with which server-side JavaScript executes is impressive.
O'Reilly's new <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning Node</em></span>, written by Shelley Powers, is a gentle
introduction to node.js for people who already know JavaScript, but
who haven't yet used it with a server.
</p><p>
Powers covers the basics of installation, moves onto common patterns
and paradigms of working with node.js, and then introduces a number of
topics that should be familiar to all Web developers, from application
frameworks (Express) and templating systems (EJS), to relational and
non-relational databases, to testing and SSL. As node.js grows in
popularity, it's probably a good idea for all Web developers to gain
at least some familiarity with it, and this book provides a great way
to gain some experience.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c4c580.0x1d44eb0"></a>
Other Languages</h2></div></div><p>
Although it's not quite a language, HTML5 has become quite the superstar
in the Web world&mdash;and for good reason, as I have discussed in many
columns to date. HTML5, although imperfect and still far from being
universally delivered, offers the tantalizing prospect of full-fledged
applications running inside our browsers. If you're still trying
to make sense of the many HTML5 features and how they fit together
with your favorite JavaScript library, you should take a look at
O'Reilly's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming HTML5 Applications</em></span>, written by
Zach Kessin.
</p><p>
Kessin, like many HTML5 authors before him, discusses a number of
HTML5-related technologies, each in its own chapter. So if you want
to understand how to work with files, local storage, Web workers or
even Web sockets, you won't be surprised to find a chapter on each of
those topics. What I found refreshing in this book was the attention to testing
the JavaScript portion of HTML5 applications using QUnit and Selenium.
The book also looks at how each of these HTML5 features works with
existing JavaScript frameworks, so that jQuery and extJS users will
understand what they need to do, or what the framework provides, to
ensure smooth usage.
</p><p>
If you already are familiar with HTML5, but (like me) still
are learning how to work with mobile devices, O'Reilly's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Head First
Mobile Web</em></span>, written by Lyza Danger Gardner and Jason Grigsby, might
fit the bill. Like other volumes in the &ldquo;Head First&rdquo; series, this
book aims at deep understanding, rather than
teaching you a great many things. So you shouldn't expect to come away
from this book an expert in mobile Web application development, but you
should come away with a good understanding of how to design a site such
that it's appropriate for use with mobile devices.
</p><p>
Although I love Ruby (and Rails), I'm starting to look into a number of
other languages, some of which I will explore in these pages during the
coming year. One language I definitely want to spend more time
learning and working with is Erlang, in which creating new processes
is as fundamental, safe and easy as allocating a new string. Zach
Kessin's book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Building Web Applications with Erlang</em></span>, published by
O'Reilly, is an eye-opening introduction to the language and its use
as a Web back end for massively scalable applications.
</p><p>
I must also mention R, a language designed for statistical work that
I'm finding is increasingly in demand. <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Art of R
Programming</em></span>,
written by Norman Matloff and published by No Starch Press, is a great
introduction to R as a programming language, not just for statistical
programming. <span   class="emphasis"><em>The R Cookbook</em></span>, published by O'Reilly and written by
Paul Teetor, is notable for the large number of basic and advanced
techniques, presented clearly and without too much text or background,
for aspiring R hackers.
</p><p>
And although it's not a programing language, I'm starting to understand
and use tmux (<a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net" target="_self">tmux.sourceforge.net</a>), an alternative to GNU
Screen that is gaining many fans. <span   class="emphasis"><em>tmux: Productive Mouse-Free
Development</em></span>, published by The Pragmatic
Programmers and written by Brian P. Hogan, is short and practical,
and really got me to appreciate how great this tool is and how much I
need to use it even more in my work.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c4c580.0x1d45488"></a>
Databases</h2></div></div><p>
Readers of this column know I'm a big fan of PostgreSQL, which
not only continues to be an excellent database, but also a great
example of a well-run open-source project. However, as a consultant
asked to work on a variety of different systems and platforms, and as
someone who tries to apply the best tool to each job, I try to stay
abreast of the latest goings-on with other open-source databases,
both relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL).
</p><p>
By all standards, MySQL is the most popular open-source database, and
one of the main questions people always ask is, &ldquo;How can I make
my queries run faster?&rdquo; An excellent book on the subject, now in its
third edition, is <span   class="emphasis"><em>High-Performance MySQL</em></span>, written by Baron
Schwartz, Peter Zaitsev and Vadim Tkachenko. It's true that this
book focuses on the speed aspects of MySQL&mdash;how to design, index
and query MySQL in the optimum ways, and then also how to figure out
what &ldquo;the optimum ways&rdquo; are for your particular database. The
chapters on replication (including master-master) and high
availability were particularly interesting, both for someone coming
from more of a PostgreSQL background and for understanding what tools
and techniques are available (and standard) in the MySQL world.
</p><p>
Just as developers constantly should be learning new programming
languages, it's also important to learn and work with new
databases and storage systems. An interesting entry in this
department is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Seven Databases in Seven Weeks</em></span> by Eric Redmond and
Jim R. Wilson and published by The Pragmatic Programmers. As the
title says, it introduces seven different databases&mdash;PostgreSQL,
Riak, HBase, MongoDB, CouchDB, Neo4J and Redis&mdash;and shows how to
work with each of them, broken down across several days per database.
If you're interested in the differences (and similarities) between
different database products, you almost certainly will enjoy this
book.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c4c580.0x1d457a0"></a>
Podcasts and Screencasts</h2></div></div><p>
I continue to be a big fan of podcasts, which I typically listen to
while walking between train stations and my clients' offices. I find
them to be fun, interesting, up-to-date and plugged in to the
technical and other communities I want to follow.
</p><p>
My favorite podcast, hands down, is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ruby Rogues</em></span>
(<a href="http://rubyrogues.com" target="_self">rubyrogues.com</a>), which I strongly recommend even for people
who aren't Ruby developers, because of the excellent and interesting
discussions of software engineering, object-oriented programing and
entrepreneurship. The podcast keeps me laughing almost as much as it
keeps me thinking. Charles Max Wood, who runs the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ruby
Rogues</em></span>
podcast, has two others to which I subscribe: <span   class="emphasis"><em>JavaScript
Jabber</em></span>
(<a href="http://javascriptjabber.com" target="_self">javascriptjabber.com</a>) and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ruby
Freelancers</em></span>
(<a href="http://rubyfreelancers.com" target="_self">rubyfreelancers.com</a>). Although I enjoy those as well and try to
listen to them as they are distributed, they don't seem to pack the
punch of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ruby Rogues</em></span>.
</p><p>
A podcast I have discovered only recently, but that I'm
mentioning because it covers the high-tech world from a business
perspective, is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mixergy</em></span>, Andrew Warner's frequent interviews with
entrepreneurs. It's always interesting for me to hear the stories of
people who are creating successful businesses and to learn about what
they have gone through in order to achieve success. I think it's
important for software developers to know about the business,
marketing and customer-service side of things; we tend to have a view
that the software is the most important part of any business, when
it's actually the customer experience and value.
</p><p>
I should also mention the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Economist</em></span>'s
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Babbage</em></span> podcast, which looks
at the technology and high-tech worlds. Like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mixergy</em></span>, it
covers
technology topics from a business perspective, but with the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Economist</em></span>'s typical interesting insights and humor.
</p><p>
Screencasts continue to be a growing part of the on-line ecosystem, and
although I don't watch as many of these as I would like (mostly because I
cannot do so while walking to or from the train station), they can be
quite interesting and useful. The weekly <span   class="emphasis"><em>RailsCasts</em></span>
(<a href="http://railscasts.com" target="_self">railscasts.com</a>) always are excellent, with Ryan Bates
offering a $9/month &ldquo;pro&rdquo; subscription that provides additional
screencasts as well.
</p><p>
A relative newcomer, at least to me, is Gary Bernhardt's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Destroy all
Software</em></span> (<a href="http://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts" target="_self">www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts</a>), a $9/month biweekly
screencast mainly aimed at Ruby and Git, but with a large smattering of
Python and Linux insights as well. I have found these to be quite
interesting and useful, as well as humorous and focused.
</p><p>
The latest individual offering a paid monthly subscription to
screencasts is Avdi Grimm, with his <span   class="emphasis"><em>RubyTapas</em></span>
(<a href="http://rubytapas.com" target="_self">rubytapas.com</a>) ten-minute screencasts released three times
each week, with the Monday edition being free of charge. Grimm is a
well-regarded speaker and writer, and the few samples I've seen of
this new offering have been interesting.
</p><p>
Finally, although they're not podcasts or screencasts, weekly e-mail
newsletters have become increasingly useful, with links
to interesting blog posts, books, releases and trends. You can think
of these newsletters as smart, weekly RSS readers in your inbox.
Among the newsletters I receive are &ldquo;Ruby Weekly&rdquo;
(<a href="http://rubyweekly.com" target="_self">rubyweekly.com</a>), &ldquo;JavaScript Weekly&rdquo;
(<a href="http://javascriptweekly.com" target="_self">javascriptweekly.com</a>), &ldquo;StatusCode&rdquo;
(<a href="http://statuscode.org" target="_self">statuscode.org</a>),
&ldquo;Python Weekly&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.pythonweekly.com" target="_self">www.pythonweekly.com</a>) and
&ldquo;Freelancing Weekly&rdquo;
(<a href="http://freelancingweekly.com" target="_self">freelancingweekly.com</a>). I don't really read all of the links
they present, but that's sort of the point. There's no way
I would have time to find all of these links, let alone read them, on
my own.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c4c580.0x1d3ce48"></a>
Other Books</h2></div></div><p>
There's not much room left for me to recommend my favorite
non-computer books of the year. I was very excited to teach a Ruby
class in Beijing in June 2012, and I prepared for that trip in part by
reading some books. I already had recommended Peter Hessler's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Country Driving</em></span>, so it made sense for me to read (and now recommend)
his two other books, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Oracle Bones</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>River
Town</em></span>, both of which
were as fascinating and deep as they were funny. I also read
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Postcards from Tomorrow Square</em></span> by James Fallows and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dreaming in
Chinese</em></span> by Deborah Fallows; I didn't think that they were quite as
strong as the Hessler books, but I still enjoyed them a great deal.
</p><p>
I also managed to learn a bit of Mandarin through ChinesePod
(<a href="http://chinesepod.com" target="_self">chinesepod.com</a>), which not only helped me learn some of the
language and customs, but also provided my children with hours of
entertainment (or torture) as they listened to their father trying to
mimic the sounds.
</p><p>
When I was younger, I thoroughly enjoyed Raymond Smullyan's writing, a
logician and mathematician who wrote some great books of logic
puzzles. I decided to get two of his books for my children to enjoy
with me, and although I perhaps wore out my welcome with an overdose, we
all enjoyed thinking through the puzzles in <span   class="emphasis"><em>What is the Name of this
Book?</em></span>
</p><p>
Finally, if you're interested in understanding a bit about how the
brain works and allows us to follow such puzzles, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Thinking, Fast and
Slow</em></span> by Daniel Kahneman has been a pleasure to read, not only because
of his insightful descriptions of how people think, but also for his
descriptions of many great psychology experiments through the years,
the designs of which are as interesting to me as the results they
provided.
