Testing and redirecting stdin, stdout and stderr can be complicated within
a shell script. Dave digs in and shows you how to change your
redirects even halfway
through running a script.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24cd580.0x25c5358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, I erroneously titled my column as &ldquo;SIGALRM Timers and
Stdin Analysis&rdquo;. It turned out that by the time I'd finished writing
it, I had spent a lot of time talking about SIGALRM and how to set up
timers to avoid scripts that hang forever, but I never actually got to
the topic of stdin analysis. Oops.
</p><p>
So this month, let's start with that topic. The behavior to
emulate here is something a lot of utilities do without you paying much
attention: they behave differently if their input or output is a pipe or
file than they do when it's stdin (the keyboard) or stdout (the
screen). Try <tt  >ls</tt> versus <tt  >ls|cat</tt> to see what I mean.
</p><p>
The <tt  >test</tt> command has a helpful flag in this regard:
<tt  >-t</tt>. From the
man page:

<pre     class="programlisting">
True if the file whose file descriptor number is
file_descriptor is open and is associated with a terminal.
</pre>
</p><p>
Worth knowing is that file descriptor #0 is stdin; #1 is stdout, and #2 is
stderr (pronounced &ldquo;standard in&rdquo;, &ldquo;standard out&rdquo; and
&ldquo;standard error&rdquo;, respectively). That's why using
<tt  >&gt;&amp;</tt>
to redirect by file descriptors works with <tt  >2&gt;&amp;1</tt> to cause error
messages to go to stdout just like regular output messages.
</p><p>
Back to the topic though&mdash;in practice, the <tt  >-t</tt> test
can be used like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
if [ -t 0 ]; then
  echo script running interactively
else
  echo stdin coming from a pipe or file
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
It's easy to test:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ sh inter.sh
script running interactively
$ sh inter.sh &lt; inter.sh
stdin coming from a pipe or file
$ cat inter.sh | sh inter.sh
stdin coming from a pipe or file

</pre>
</p><p>
Perfect. Now, what about identifying if the output is an interactive
terminal, file or pipe? It turns out that you can use the same basic test, just
replace the file ID 0 with #1:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ -t 1 ] ; then
  echo output going to the screen
else
  echo output redirected to a file or pipe
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
The results:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh inter.sh
script running interactively
output going to the screen
$ sh inter.sh | cat
script running interactively
output redirected to a file or pipe
$ sh inter.sh &gt; output.txt
$ cat output.txt
script running interactively
output redirected to a file or pipe
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24cd580.0x25c5d50"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Pretty cool, actually.
</p><p>
Let's back up a bit and have another look at file redirection before 
leaving this topic, however.
</p><p>
I already talked about the common trick of <tt  >2&gt;&amp;1</tt> to redirect stderr to
stdout&mdash;something that's very helpful on the command line. You also
can redirect specific lines of output in a shell script to stderr, so your error
messages are sent to the screen even if stdout is being sent to a pipe or
file:

<pre     class="programlisting">

echo Error: this is an error message &gt;&amp;2

</pre>
</p><p>
But, what if you want to have your script force stdout to a specific target
regardless of what someone does on the command line? It can be done&mdash;of
course&mdash;although it involves a very different approach: the use of the
<tt  >exec</tt> command.
</p><p>
At its most basic, the <tt  >exec</tt> call is like a subshell invocation
(which is really what happens each time you invoke any system command like
<tt  >ls</tt> or <tt  >fmt</tt>), but it's the
existing shell that's
replaced with the specified command, effectively killing the current
process. If you have a shell script that sets up specific parameters for an
external call, for example, you could end it with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
exec $cmd $args
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24cd580.0x25c6278"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and anything you might have after that point in the original script is
jettisoned because the script is no longer running, it's replaced by
<tt  >$command</tt>.
</p><p>
But <tt  >exec</tt> actually is more nuanced than that, and in
particular, a
quirk of its behavior gives the solution we seek:
<tt  >exec</tt>
replaces all the current assignments for stdin, stdout and stderr with
those specified as part of the invocation.
</p><p>
So here's the solution, redirecting stdout to a file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
exec &gt; output.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
In practice, you can see how it works with this snippet:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo This is stdout
exec &gt; output.txt
echo This is still stdout but goes elsewhere
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's actually put a few different things together in this script, so
you can see how this all works together:

<pre     class="programlisting">

echo this goes to stdout
echo and this goes to stderr &gt;&amp;2
exec &gt; output.txt
echo This is still stdout but goes elsewhere
echo but where does this go\? &gt;&amp;2
exec date
echo this script is kaput

</pre>
</p><p>
Here's what happens when you run the program:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh test.sh
this goes to stdout
and this goes to stderr
but where does this go?
</pre>
</p><p>
But, what's actually in output.txt?

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat output.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
This is still stdout, but it goes elsewhere:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Sun Oct  7 10:29:56 MDT 2012
</pre>
</p><p>
Interesting. Notice that, as expected, &ldquo;this script is kaput&rdquo;
never shows up because once the <tt  >exec</tt> invokes an external program
(in this case, <tt  >date</tt>), the script itself is done, because its process
has been replaced with the <tt  >date</tt> program.
</p><p>
Notice that the <tt  >exec</tt> redirected only stdout, so that the error
message at the very end still goes to the screen. Want to have both stdout
and stderr redirected to the file? It's literally a one-character
change! Instead of the above <tt  >exec</tt> redirect, use this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

exec &amp;&gt; output.txt

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24cd580.0x25c6c70"></a></h2></div></div><p>
That's easy enough, isn't it?
</p><p>
Now, what about the opposite situation where the user has redirected stdout
to a file, but you still want it to go to the screen anyway? That's done
with yet another sequence on the <tt  >exec</tt> invocation:
<tt  >1&gt;&amp;2</tt>,
which redirects stdout to stderr.
</p><p>
Let's look at the same script as above, with <tt  >exec
1&gt;&amp;2</tt>. Here's what
happens:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh test2.sh &gt; /dev/null
and this goes to stderr
This is still stdout but goes elsewhere
but where does this go?
Sun Oct  7 10:47:44 MDT 2012
</pre>

Pretty cool, eh?

That's it for this month. As always, if you have any interesting

Also, if you have an extraordinary memory, you might recall that Mitch
Frazier wrote about similar topics in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>'s
Upfront section, during 2010,
but his approach was considerably more complicated than mine. Sorry Mitch!
