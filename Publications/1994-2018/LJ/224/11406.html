Symantec's Veritas Cluster Server</h2></div></div><p>
The beauty of the upgraded Veritas Cluster Server, says its maker Symantec,
is this: the pinnacle level of high availability and disaster recovery that
has been available in the physical world now applies to the virtual one.
Not only can applications running in virtual machines be monitored, but
they also can be recovered when an incident occurs. Virtual machine
reboots,
thus, are eliminated, keeping downtime to a minimum, allowing all users to
do business even in the face of human error, system failure or natural
disaster. Veritas allows users to choose how they want to architect their
environment&mdash;that is, fail over from V to V, V to P or P to V. Downtime from
patching, server maintenance and upgrades is eliminated, because
applications can be moved between primary and secondary nodes with no
disruption in business. The new version of Veritas Cluster Server works
with existing VMware tools like vMotion, DRS and SRM and integrates with
vCenter, such that users can continue to use the features of the native
stack without compromise.

Dell KACE K1000 Management Appliance</h2></div></div><p>
Resource-strapped IT teams face myriad challenges, including endpoint
security, regulatory compliance, server management and BYOD (Bring Your Own
Device) issues. In an effort to face down these challenges, Dell beefed
up the Dell KACE K1000 Management Appliance, which the firm describes as
&ldquo;an easy-to-use, comprehensive and affordable appliance that fulfills
all of the systems management needs of organizations of all sizes&rdquo;.
Functions include initial inventory and discovery, software distribution,
configuration management, patching, security vulnerability remediation,
asset management, service desk and reporting. This latest v.5.4 of the
K1000 adds features related to endpoint security and regulatory
compliance, which are important to the financial services and healthcare
industries, among others. Additionally, this version expands visibility and
audit-trail capabilities made possible by the new machine inventory API. But
most important, say the folks in Round Rock, the new appliance
extends operating system support to Windows 8, Mac OS X Mountain Lion, Red
Hat 6, Ubuntu and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP2&mdash;a critical
piece of the puzzle for IT admins for solving BYOD issues.

Onset HOBO Wireless Temp/RH Monitoring Kit</h2></div></div><p>
Adding measurement points to building automation systems can be expensive,
and chart recorders tend to require a lot of maintenance. To overcome these
limitations, Onset developed the HOBO Wireless Temp/RH Monitoring
Kit&mdash;an
easy-to-use, wireless system that includes everything needed to make
environmental monitoring fast, cost-effective and convenient right out of
the box. In just three steps, users can monitor critical temperature and
humidity conditions, log data for trend analysis and stay notified of
alarm conditions via text or e-mail&mdash;all without the hassles of wires
or manual data offload. The monitoring kit is appropriate for applications
in a broad range of facilities, including food processing plants, office
buildings, laboratories and warehouses. The wireless kit includes HOBOnode
Manager software, which allows users to view near real-time energy and
environmental data, set alarm notifications and get an at-a-glance view of
the system.

Ike Devolder's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Arch Linux Environment Set-up How-To</em></span> (Packt
Publishing)</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Arch Linux Environment Set-up How-To</em></span> by Ike Devolder is a new book for
people wanting to dig deeply into a Linux system. Through the years, myriad
Linux distributions have sprung up, with some trying to do everything for
the user, others less. Arch Linux seeks to be easy and user-friendly from
the standpoint of developers and enthusiasts who want to customize their
system to a maximum degree. Devolder's book aims to get the new Arch Linux
user up to speed, and in true DIY style, it leaves the true experience
open-ended. After covering installation and package management, Devolder
develops the full Arch Linux environment step by step in a task + recipe
format. The recipe as a solution consists of a carefully organized set of
instructions to perform the task as efficiently as possible and a
discussion on how to apply the solution in different situations.

BeyondTrust's Retina Community</h2></div></div><p>
Today's landscape of security threats is changing as dynamically as IT
environments, resulting in a prime breeding ground for vulnerabilities. To
better assist organizations in dealing with the barrage of exploits and
targeted attacks, BeyondTrust has upgraded Retina Community, a free
vulnerability assessment tool based upon the network security scanner
Retina Network. The solution helps to identify potential weaknesses and
help prioritize which need to be addressed first. This new edition of
Retina Community includes scanning profiles for security and compliance.
IT professionals responsible for critical areas, such as servers, desktops,
virtualization and databases can assess their focus area
for vulnerabilities quickly and easily. Furthermore, the free license has increased to 
support the assessment of up to 256 assets, further reducing the attack
surface in companies large and small.

Charles Babbage's <span   class="emphasis"><em>On the Principles and Development of the Calculator and
Other Seminal Writings</em></span> (Dover Publications)</h2></div></div><p>
Eighteenth-century British &ldquo;Renaissance man&rdquo; Charles Babbage developed the
idea of a programmable computer and articulated the principles on which all
modern computing machines are based. To keep Babbage's seminal ideas from
disappearing, Dover Publications is updating the 1961 release of <span   class="emphasis"><em>On the
Principles and Development of the Calculator and Other Seminal
Writings</em></span>, a
compilation of his writings and those of several of his contemporaries. The
writings illuminate the work that eventually led to the development of the
calculator. Interestingly, Babbage's Difference Engine No. 2 from the late
1800s was able to compute the values of polynomial functions with results
up to 31 digits. The ideas found in Babbage's writings are essential
reading for anyone interested in the history of computing technology.

Perforce's Git Fusion</h2></div></div><p>
Git is great, but now it's got more with help from Perforce's Git Fusion.
With Git Fusion, developers who use Git can continue to use their preferred
tools, but they now have flexible new capabilities for customization, reuse and
sharing of projects. Teams can use Git repositories and their
components in new ways, combining them and creating new repositories by
selectively reusing elements from other Git or Perforce code lines. Git
Fusion also extends Perforce's enterprise version management capabilities
to Git repositories, bringing added IP security and defensibility,
scalability, compliance and visibility to disconnected projects. Perforce
and Git Fusion are free for up to 20 users.
