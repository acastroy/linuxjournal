Deploy and test new builds quickly with no more than rebooting the
board.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x281e580.0x2916250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Embedded developers working on kernels or bare-metal programs often go
through several development cycles. Each time the developer modifies the
code, the code has to be compiled, the ELF (Executable and Linkable
Format)/kernel image has to be copied onto the SD card, and the card
then has to be transferred from the PC to the development board and
rebooted. In my experience as a developer, I found the last two steps to be a
major bottleneck. Even copying files to the fastest SD cards is slower
than copying files between hard drives and sometimes between computers
across the network. 
</p><p>
Moreover, by frequently inserting and removing the SD
card from the slot, one incurs the risk of damaging the fragile connectors
on the development boards. Believe me! I lost a BeagleBoard by
accidentally applying too much force while holding the board and
pulling out the SD card. The pressure caused the I<sup  >2</sup>C
bus to fail. Because
the power management chip was controlled by I<sup  >2</sup>C, nothing other
than the serial terminal worked after that. Setting aside the cost of
the board, a board failure at a critical time during a project is
catastrophic if you do not have a backup board. 
</p><p>
After losing the BeagleBoard, I
hit upon the idea to load my bare-metal code
over the LAN via bootp and TFTP and leave the board untouched. This
not only reduced the risk of mechanically damaging my board, but it also
improved on my turn-around times. I no longer needed to copy files
to the SD card and move it around.
</p><p>
In this article, I present a brief introduction to U-Boot and then
describe the necessary configurations to set up a development
environment using DHCP and TFTP. The setup I present here will let
you deploy and test new builds quickly with no more than rebooting the
board. I use the BeagleBone Black (<a href="http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone%20Black" target="_self">beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone%20Black</a>) as the target
platform and Ubuntu as the development platform for my examples in this article. You may, however, use
the methods presented here to work with any board that uses U-Boot or
Barebox as its stage-2 bootloader.

U-Boot</h2></div></div><p>
U-Boot is a popular bootloader used by many development platforms. It
supports multiple architectures including ARM, MIPS, AVR32, Nios,
Microblaze, 68K and x86. U-Boot has support for several filesystems as well,
including FAT32, ext2, ext3, ext4 and Cramfs built in to it. It also has a
shell where it interactively can take input from users, and it supports
scripting. It is distributed under the GPLv2 license. U-Boot is a stage-2 bootloader. 
</p><p>
The U-Boot project also includes the x-loader. The
x-loader is a small stage-1 bootloader for ARM. Most modern chips have
the ability to read a FAT32 filesystem built in to the ROM. The x-loader
loads the U-Boot into memory and transfers control to it. U-Boot is a
pretty advanced bootloader that is capable of loading the kernel and
ramdisk image from the NAND, SD card, USB drive and even the Ethernet
via bootp, DHCP and TFTP.
</p><p>
Figure 1 shows the default boot sequence of the BeagleBone Black.
This sequence is more or less applicable to most
embedded systems. The x-loader and U-Boot executables are stored in the
files called MLO and uboot.img, respectively. These files are stored in
a FAT32 partition. The serial port outputs of the BeagleBone are shown
in Listings 1&ndash;3. The x-loader is responsible for the output shown in 
Listing 1. Once the execution is handed over to U-Boot, it offers you a
few seconds to interrupt the boot sequence, as shown in Listing 2. If you
choose not to interrupt, U-Boot executes an environment variable called
<tt  >bootcmd</tt>. <tt  >bootcmd</tt> holds the search sequence for
a file called <tt  >uImage</tt>. This is the kernel image. The kernel
image is loaded into the memory, and the execution finally is transferred
to the kernel, as shown in Listing 3.

The search sequence defined in the <tt  >bootcmd</tt> variable and
the filename (uImage) are hard-coded in the U-Boot source code (see Listing 9).
Listing 4 shows the formatted content of the
environment variable <tt  >bootcmd</tt>. The interesting parts of 
<tt  >bootcmd</tt> are lines 19&ndash;28. This part of the script checks
for the existence of a file called uEnv.txt. If the file is
found, the file is loaded into the memory (line 19). Then, it is imported
to the environment ready to be read or executed (line 22). After this,
the script checks to see if the variable <tt  >uenvcmd</tt> is defined
(line 24). If it is defined, the script in the variable is executed.
The
uEnv.txt file is a method for users to insert scripts into the
environment. Here, we'll use this to override the default search sequence
and load the kernel image or an ELF file from the TFTP server.

For better insight into the workings of U-Boot, I recommend
interrupting the execution and dropping to the U-Boot shell. At the shell,
you can see a list of supported commands by typing <tt  >help</tt>
or <tt  >?</tt>. You can list all defined environment variables 
with
the <tt  >env print</tt> command. These environment variables are a
powerful tool for scripting. To resume the boot sequence, you either
can issue the <tt  >boot</tt> command or <tt  >run
bootcmd</tt>. A good way
to understand what the <tt  >bootcmd</tt> is doing is to execute each
command one at a time from the U-Boot shell and see its effect. You may
replace the <tt  >if...then...else...fi</tt> blocks by executing
the conditional statement without the <tt  >if</tt> part and checking
its output by typing <tt  >echo $?</tt>.

DHCP</h2></div></div><p>
The DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a protocol to
provide hosts with the necessary information to access the network on
demand. This includes the IP address for the host, the DNS servers, the
gateway server, the time servers, the TFTP server and so on. The DHCP server
also can provide the name of the file containing the kernel image that
the host must get from the TFTP server to continue booting. The DHCP
server can be set up to provide a configuration either for the entire
network or on a per-host basis. Configuring the filename (Listing
5) for the entire network is not a good idea, as one kernel image or ELF
file will execute only on the architecture for which it was built. For
instance, the vmlinuz image built for an x86_64 will not work on a system
with an ARM-based processor.

Be extremely careful while using the DHCP server. A network
must not have more than a single DHCP server. A second DHCP server
will cause serious problems on the network. Other users will lose
network access. If you are on a corporate or a university network,
you will generate a high-priority incident inviting the IT department
to come looking for you.
</p></div><p>
The Ubuntu apt repository offers two DHCP servers:
<tt  >isc-dhcp-server</tt> and <tt  >dhcpcd</tt>. I
prefer to use <tt  >isc-dhcp-server</tt>.
</p><p>
The <tt  >isc-dhcpd-server</tt> from the Ubuntu repository is pretty
advanced and implements all the necessary features. I recommend using
Webmin to configure it. Webmin is a Web-based configuration
tool that supports configuring several Linux-based services and d&aelig;mons. I
recommend installing Webmin from the apt repository. See the Webmin
documentation for instructions
for adding the Webmin apt repository to Ubuntu 
(<a href="http://www.webmin.com/deb.html" target="_self">www.webmin.com/deb.html</a>). 
</p><p>
Once you have your DHCP server installed, you need to configure
a subnet and select a pool of IP addresses to be dished out to
hosts on the network on request. After this, 
add the lines corresponding to the host from Listing 5 into your
/etc/dhcp/dhcpcd.conf file, or do the equivalent
from Webmin's intuitive interface. In Listing 5,
<tt  >C8:A0:30:B0:88:EB</tt>
corresponds to the BeagleBone's Ethernet address. The
<tt  >next-server</tt> is the address of the TFTP server from
which to fetch the kernel image of ELF. The <tt  >/BI/uImage</tt>
filename
is the name of the kernel image. Rename 
the image to whatever you use.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x281e580.0x290eb30"></a>
TFTP</h2></div></div><p>
TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) is a lightweight file-transfer
protocol. It does not support authentication methods. Anyone can connect
and download any file by name from the server or upload any file to the
server. You can, however, protect your server to some extent by setting
firewall rules to deny IP addresses out of a particular range. You 
also can make the TFTP home directory read-only to the world. This should
prevent any malicious uploads to the server. The Ubuntu apt repository
has two different TFTP servers: <tt  >atftp</tt> and
<tt  >tftp-hpa</tt>. I
recommend <tt  >tftp-hpa</tt>, as development of
<tt  >atftp</tt>
has seized since 2004.
</p><p>
tftpd-hpa is more or less ready to run just after
installation. The default file store is usually
/var/lib/tftpboot/, and the
configuration files for tftp-can may be found in
/etc/default/tftpd-hpa. You can change the
location of the default file store to any other location of your choice
by changing the <tt  >TFTP_DIRECTORY</tt> option. The TFTP
installation creates a user and a group called tftp. The tftp
server runs as this user. I recommend adding yourself to the tftp group
and changing permissions on the tftp data directory to 775. This will
let you read and write to the tftp data directory without switching to
root each time. Moreover, if files in the tftp data directory are owned
by root, the tftp server will not be able to read and serve them over the
network. You can test your server by placing a file there and attempting
to get it using the tftp client:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tftp 192.168.146.1 -c get uImage[COMMAND]
</pre>
</p><p>
Some common problems you may face include errors due to
permission. Make sure that the files are readable by the tftp user or
whichever user the tftpd runs as. Additionally, directories must have
execute permission, or tftp will not be able to descend and read the
content of that directory, and you'll see a &ldquo;Permission denied&rdquo;
error when you attempt to get the file.

U-Boot Scripting</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have your DHCP and TFTP servers working, let's write a
U-Boot script that will fetch the kernel image and boot it. I'm going to
present two ways of doing this: using DHCP and using only TFTP. As
I mentioned before, running a poorly configured DHCP server will cause
a network-wide disruption of services. However, if you know what you
are doing and have prior experience with setting up network services,
this is the simplest way to boot the board.
</p><p>
A DHCP boot can be initiated simply by adding or modifying the
<tt  >uenvcmd</tt> variable in the uEnv.txt file, as shown in Listing
6. uEnv.txt is found in the FAT32 partition of the BeagleBone
Black. This partition is available to be mounted when the BeagleBone
Black is connected to your computer via USB cable.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x281e580.0x290f160"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 6. An Example of the uenvcmd Variable for DHCP Booting</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo Booting the BeagleBone Black from LAN (DHCP)...

setenv bootargs console=${console} ${optargs} root=${mmcroot}
 &#8618;rootfstype=${mmcrootfstype} optargs=quiet
bootm ${kloadaddr} - ${fdtaddr}
</pre></div><p>
For a TFTP-only boot, you manually specify an IP address for the
development board and the TFTP server. This is a much safer process,
and you incur very little risk of interfering with other users on the
network. As in the case of configuring to boot with DHCP, you must
modify the <tt  >uenvcmd</tt> variable in the uEnv.txt file. The
script shown
in Listing 7 is an example of how to set up your BeagleBone Black to
get a kernel image from the TFTP server and pass on the execution to it.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x281e580.0x290f4d0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

</pre></div><p>
Both Listing 6 and 7 are formatted to give a clear understanding
of the process. The actual uEnv.txt file should look something
like the script shown in Listing 8. For more information about U-Boot
scripting, refer to the U-Boot FAQ (<a href="http://www.denx.de/wiki/DULG/Faq" target="_self">www.denx.de/wiki/DULG/Faq</a>) and U-Boot
Manual (<a href="http://www.denx.de/wiki/DULG/Manual" target="_self">www.denx.de/wiki/DULG/Manual</a>). The various commands in the
<tt  >uenvcmd</tt>
variable must be on the same line separated by a semicolon. You
may notice that I place my script in <tt  >uenvcmdx</tt> instead of
<tt  >uenvcmd</tt>. This is because <tt  >test -n</tt>
throws an error to the console based on the content of the variable it is
testing. Certain variable contents, especially long complicated scripts,
cause the <tt  >test -n</tt> to fail with an error message to the
console. Therefore, I put a simple command to <tt  >run
uenvcmdx</tt> in
<tt  >uenvcmd</tt>. If you find that your script from the uEnv.txt is
not being executed, look for an error on the serial console like this:

On some development boards like the BeagleBoard xM (<a href="http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBoard-xM" target="_self">beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBoard-xM</a>), the
Ethernet port is implemented on the USB bus. Therefore, it is necessary
to start the USB subsystem before attempting any network-based boot. If
your development board does not hold a Flash memory on board, it may
not have a MAC address either. In this case, you will have to set a MAC
address before you can issue any network requests. You can do that by
setting the environment variable <tt  >ethaddr</tt> along with the rest
of the uEnv.txt script.
</p><p>
An alternative but cumbersome way to change the default boot sequence
is to modify the U-Boot source code. Modifying the source code gives you
greater versatility for booting your development board. When you interrupt
the U-Boot boot sequence, drop to the U-Boot shell and issue the <tt  >env
print</tt> command, you'll see a lot of environment
variables that are defined by default. These environment variables are
defined as macros in the source code. Modifying the source code aims at
modifying these variables. As shown in Figure 1, U-Boot begins loading
the kernel by executing the script in <tt  >bootcmd</tt>. Hence, this is
the variable that must be modified.
</p><p>
To begin, you'll need the source code to U-Boot from the git repository:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ git clone git://git.denx.de/u-boot.git
</pre>
</p><p>
Before making any modifications, I recommend compiling the unmodified
source code as a sanity check:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- distclean

$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- am335x_evm_config

$ make -j 8 ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
</pre>
</p><p>
This most likely will work without a hitch. Now you can modify the
u-Boot/include/configs/am335x_evm.h file. In
this file, you'll find code similar to Listing 9. Modify this as you
please and re-compile. Depending on your target board, you will have to
modify a different file. The files to some common target platforms are:

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I hope the instructions provided here help you create
a system to develop and deploy bare-metal programs and kernel
images quickly. You also may want to look into u-boot-v2, also known as Barebox
(<a href="http://barebox.org" target="_self">barebox.org</a>).
The most helpful code modification that I suggest
here is to compile the U-Boot with an elaborate boot sequence that you
can tailor to your needs with the least modifications. You can try out
some fancy scripts to check and update firmware over LAN&mdash;I would
consider that really cool. Write to me at bharath (you-know-what) lohray
