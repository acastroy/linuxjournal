Think shell scripts can deal only with text? You'll be amazed at what you
can do as Dave begins his exploration of ImageMagick and its many useful
tricks. 
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf25580.0x101d358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I've spent a lot of time in this column talking about text processing and
analysis, with the basic assumption that if you're using the command line,
you're focused on text. That's not always true, and if you work with
images at all&mdash;whether JPEG, PNG, GIF or another format&mdash;there's a
free-to-download suite of image-related utilities available that offers
rather amazing capabilities direct from the command line and, therefore, also
from within shell scripts.
</p><p>
I'm talking about ImageMagick, a set of programs that has grown and
expanded through the years and now includes powerful Perl and Ruby
interfaces too.
But, pshaw! We don't need no stinkin' Perl or Ruby. We'll stick
with our hard-core shell commands, thank you very much.
</p><p>
You'll find a downloadable binary and source both at
<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org" target="_self">www.imagemagick.org</a>, and as always, I recommend you download source
and compile it on your system if you can. It's far more reliable than hoping
someone else's compiled version is optimized for your own hardware
configuration.
</p><p>
A variety of different commands are included with the ImageMagick
distribution that I divide into &ldquo;analysis&rdquo; and
&ldquo;editing&rdquo;
tools. For this article, let's stick with the analysis tools. Let me
start by showing you how much more information it offers on a typical image
file than the standard Linux command line.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf25580.0x101d778"></a>
Analyzing Images for Non-Optimized Resolutions</h2></div></div><p>
If you've been using Linux for even a short time, you've probably
learned about the <tt  >file</tt> command. It can be helpful with some
file types:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ file wp-content.tar.gz
wp-content.tar.gz: gzip compressed data, from Unix
</pre>
</p><p>
But, the command is generally useless with images:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ file pvp.jpg
pvp.jpg: JPEG image data, EXIF standard
</pre>
</p><p>
Um, what about image size? How about any useful info at all? Jeez.
</p><p>
Enter the ImageMagick <tt  >identify</tt> command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ identify pvp.jpg
pvp.jpg JPEG 970x311 DirectClass 114kb 0.010u 0:01
</pre>
</p><p>
Ahh...so this particular image has the dimensions (the suite refers to
dimensions as the &ldquo;geometry&rdquo; of the image) of 970x311. That's
useful.
</p><p>
Do you want even more information though? The <tt  >-verbose</tt> option spits out a
somewhat overwhelming amount of data:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ identify -verbose pvp.jpg
Image: pvp.jpg

</pre>
</p><p>
Truth be told, dimensions and resolution are the most useful pieces of
information from this crazy-long output.
</p><p>
With a tiny bit of effort, you can extract just those items of information:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ identify -verbose pvp.jpg | grep -E '(Resolution:|Geometry:)'
  Geometry: 970x311
  Resolution: 72x72
</pre>
</p><p>
Now imagine you are working on a Web site and want to ensure that no images on
the site are greater than 72dpi, a standard screen resolution. Higher
print-ready resolutions are rather pointless, because a 300dpi image will
render the same on a screen as its lower-resolution brethren&mdash;it'll just load
slower.
</p><p>
Here's one way you can identify images in a directory with incorrect
resolutions:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
identify=/usr/bin/identify
# check images to ensure that they're all 72x72 resolution.
for filename
do
  resolution=$($identify -verbose $filename | \
     grep -i "Resolution:" | grep -v 72x72)
  if [ ! -z "$resolution" ] ; then
    echo "Warning: Image $filename has $resolution"
  fi
done
exit 0
</pre>
</p><p>
When I run this on a directory of images on my own system, a set of JPEG
format files on my <a href="http://www.AskDaveTaylor.com" target="_self">www.AskDaveTaylor.com</a> site, here's what I get:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ checkres.sh *.jpg
Warning: Image auction-seller-img1.jpg has Resolution: 75x75
Warning: Image auction-seller-img2.jpg has Resolution: 75x75
Warning: Image browsing-the-photo-folder.jpg has Resolution: 96x96
Warning: Image brushed-metal.jpg has Resolution: 300x300
...
</pre>
</p><p>
That's a surprise! I didn't realize that I had 300x300 and these other
weird resolutions. An easy way to speed up my site, therefore, is to lower the
resolution on these images to the standard 72dpi. This is something that 
also can be done with a call to a different ImageMagick utility, but let's
tackle that in another article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf25580.0x101e220"></a>
Working with Image Size</h2></div></div><p>
Since I write a lot of scripts that harvest images or other content from sites
and repurpose them for my own (generally private, not public-facing) use, I
also find it is darn helpful in a shell script to be able to ascertain the
size of an image I've just grabbed.
</p><p>
If you've guessed that <tt  >identify</tt> is the key, you're right. In
fact, given an image, this is an easy way to grab its height and width:

<pre     class="programlisting">
height=$(identify $image | cut -d\   -f3 | cut -dx -f1)
width=$(identify $image | cut -d\   -f3 | cut -dx -f2)
</pre>
</p><p>
There's no need for verbose output, because the geometry of the image is included in the
default output.
</p><p>
Now it's easy to produce higher-quality HTML, for example, by including
images with their proper dimensions:

<pre     class="programlisting">

echo "&lt;img src=$image height=$height width=$width&gt;"

</pre>
</p><p>
What's better is that Web browsers are able to scale images automatically,
so if you specify a height and width that are different from the default
dimensions (oops, sorry, &ldquo;geometry&rdquo;) of the image, it'll
scale automatically.
</p><p>
This means if I want to include the pvp.jpg image on an automatically
generated page, but decide 970 pixels is just too wide, I can simply include
it as:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;img src=pvp.jpg height=207 width=646&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf25580.0x101e698"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and the browser&mdash;be it Chrome, Safari or even MS IE&mdash;will scale it
appropriately.
</p><p>
Calculating the smaller size is straightforward with <tt  >bc</tt>, another
underappreciated Linux command. The entire sequence might look like this to
scale the image to 66% of its original dimensions:


<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/bin/sh
identify=/usr/bin/identify
scale=0.666
image=$1   # add input validation code

height=$($identify $image | cut -d\   -f3 | cut -dx -f1)
width=$($identify $image | cut -d\   -f3 | cut -dx -f2)
newwidth="$(echo $width \* $scale | bc | cut -d. -f1)"
newheight="$(echo $height \* $scale | bc | cut -d. -f1)"
echo "&lt;img src=$image height=$newheight width=$newwidth&gt;"
exit 0

</pre>
</p><p>
In practical use:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ scaledown.sh pvp.jpg
&lt;img src=pvp.jpg height=646 width=207&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
That's easy enough!
</p><p>
With some creativity, you can see how even just the
<tt  >identify</tt> command
that's included with ImageMagick opens up a world of image file scripting
possibilities, whether you're working with Web sites directly or simply
seek to analyze directories of images for unusual values or settings.
</p><p>
I'll dig into some of the really slick editing and
modification capabilities, including an easy way to add a so-called
watermark to your graphics, along with ways you can automate fixing 300dpi
resolution images or even scaling images, in an upcoming article.
</p><p>
As a final note, although I explain how you can take a large image and have it
show up smaller on a Web page by using different values for height and width,
it would be remiss of me not to mention that if you're going to use
only the smaller size, it's smarter to resize the original image. It makes
your page faster to load, less unneeded data is transferred and
everything just generally is happier (including the search engines). Now you
know.
