<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #234, October 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
There recently was a flame war on the <span   class="bold"><b>linux-kernel
mailing list</b></span> that got some
attention outside the kernel community. It started when <span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span>
complained that people were sending patches for the stable series that didn't
belong there, and <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> suggested he learn how to yell at people more;
then <span   class="bold"><b>Sarah Sharp</b></span> said that Linus shouldn't be advocating abuse.
</p><p>
It turned out to be an interesting culture clash. Sarah posed her argument as,
&ldquo;Violence, whether it be physical intimidation, verbal threats or verbal abuse
is not acceptable. Keep it professional on the mailing lists.&rdquo; And,
&ldquo;In
karate, or any other sport, if your opponent is motionless on the floor, you
stop. You can't see the person you're emailing. You can't see if the first
conversation-disabling blow has completely knocked them out. You can't see if
you've misjudged their mental strength for the day and completely wiped out
their ability to use their brain to correct the technical mistake you're trying
to get them to fix.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Linus posed his response as being, &ldquo;People are different. I'm not polite, and I
get upset easily but generally don't hold a grudge&mdash;I have these explosive
emails. And that works well for some people. And it probably doesn't work well
with you. And you know what? That's fine. Not everybody has to get along or
work well with each other. But the fact that it doesn't work with you doesn't
make it 'wrong'.&rdquo; And he said that the issue was really about &ldquo;how to work
together DESPITE people being different. Not about trying to make everybody
please each other.&rdquo; He gave the example of Sarah's work with Greg, saying that
they worked a lot with each other, probably because they did work well
together, and that that was as it should be.
</p><p>
The debate went on for a bit, and ultimately the two of them, and others,
decided to continue the discussion at the upcoming <span   class="bold"><b>Kernel
Summit</b></span>, over cookies
and pot brownies.
</p><p>
The debate interests me personally because, on the one hand, no one should ever
be abused. That's what abuse is&mdash;something that shouldn't happen.
Otherwise,
it's just an activity. And on the other hand (in my opinion), not all of his
&ldquo;yelling&rdquo; is really abuse. For one thing, it's an e-mail list, and there is a
long and glorious history of flame wars on e-mail lists. People aren't required
to participate, even when Linus Torvalds is the one doing the flaming. So I'm
interested to see what kind of public pressure ultimately will come to bear on
Linus to stop doing something that's really an ordinary on-line activity.

<h2 class="title">Dude, Where's My Car?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #234, October 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
When my family moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan, last year, one of the biggest
adjustments was dealing with city parking. While we usually remember
what side of the mall we parked on, there was a time downtown that I
couldn't remember what parking garage we used, much less what level or
spot. Thankfully, I had the parking ticket in my pocket, which included
the address for the particular parking lot we used. Although we had to
walk up 15 levels one by one to find the car, at least we knew it was
there somewhere!
</p><p>
If you've ever walked around a parking lot wondering if you were the
victim of theft, or possibly going senile, Valet is the perfect app
for you. It not only remembers the GPS location of your parked car,
but it also has a timer to remind you of parking meter timing. Plus,
if your car has Bluetooth connectivity, Valet will record where you left
your car without any interaction on your part. It just marks the location
where Bluetooth disconnected, and it happily guides you back when
you've finished spending your paycheck at Teavana in the mall. (Maybe
that's just me.)
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11563androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="11563androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
In fact, Valet fills such a simple yet helpful purpose, it's earned this
month's Editors' Choice award. Its automatic tracking based on vehicle
Bluetooth is really the feature that puts it over the top for me. It's
the best $0.99 I've spent in a while. You can find it at the Google Play store,
or check out the Web site: <a href="http://valetapp.co" target="_self">valetapp.co</a>.

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Launchy!</h2>

With Unity's method for launching and finding programs and applications,
and OS X's spotlight tool becoming the new way to launch programs, the
entire way we think about launching programs is changing. Although I still
like to have a few icon shortcuts on my task bar, many folks prefer
a quick keystroke to bring up Gnome-Do, or Unity's launcher, or even
OS X's spotlight. If you're one of those people, but can't seem to find
a smooth way to accomplish your launching on Windows, check out Launchy.
</p><p>
Launchy is an open-source d&aelig;mon that runs on Windows, OS X or Linux. It
listens for a predefined keystroke and then pops up a search window. You
start typing the application, document or media file you want to start,
and Launchy autocompletes based on its index of your system. The main
advantage is the ability to launch a program without moving your fingers
from the keyboard.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11563fossf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
(Image from <a href="http://www.launchy.net" target="_self">www.launchy.net</a>)
</p></div></div><p>
Launchy is fast, accurate and doesn't steal lots of resources on your
system. I can't find a way to make Windows behave this way on its own,
so although Launchy is cross-platform, it probably will be the most useful
for Windows users. You can download your copy today at <a href="http://www.launchy.net" target="_self">www.launchy.net</a>.

<h2 class="title">Own Your Data with OwnCloud</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #234, October 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I love Dropbox. I really do. With a Google AdWords campaign, and $50
or so, I was able to max out my free storage. That means I have around
24GB of free Dropbox storage to fiddle with. Granted, that's a lot, but
in the grand scheme of things, 24GB isn't very much space. During the past
few years, I've mentioned several alternatives (like SparkleShare), but the
new kid on the block, OwnCloud, is a Web-based application that provides
a plethora of cloud-based services. The most popular is its file syncing.
</p><p>
Setting up OwnCloud isn't for the faint of heart, as it requires some PHP
tweaking and really should be SSL-encrypted, but for anyone comfortable
with configuring LAMP applications, it's not insurmountable. Once your
server is installed, there are native syncing applications for Windows,
OS X, Linux, Android and iOS. Because OwnCloud is hosted on your own server,
your space limitation is based on your actual hard drive space!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11563ownf1.large.jpg"><img src="11563ownf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
If you've ever wished your Dropbox data was hosted on your own servers,
or if you just don't have enough space, check out OwnCloud. It not only
supplies file syncing, but with its extendible infrastructure, it also can
do calendaring, sharing and pretty much anything else you'd want to do with
cloud computing. Check it out today at <a href="http://www.owncloud.org" target="_self">www.owncloud.org</a>.

<h2 class="title">Surf Safely with sshuttle</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #234, October 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In past issues, I've explained how to set up a SOCKS proxy with
SSH. I've demonstrated how to tunnel traffic with SSH. I've even shown
how to circumvent a company firewall with SSH. I've never been able
to use SSH completely as a VPN, however, and that's always bummed me
out&mdash;until I discovered sshuttle.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11563shuttlef1.large.jpg"><img src="11563shuttlef1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Mind you, sshuttle isn't a new program. It isn't even a new concept. What
it is, however, is pure awesome. Basically, launching the sshuttle binary
with root privileges will modify your system firewall to tunnel all
(yes <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>) traffic through a remote SSH connection. The remote connection
doesn't even need administrator privileges, so your shell account at
your Web host might suffice for securing your traffic in a hotel or coffee
shop. sshuttle will even tunnel your DNS lookups, which means your entire
network interaction should be secure and encrypted.
</p><p>
sshuttle is in many OS repositories, or you can downloaded it from
<a href="https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle" target="_self">https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle</a>.
</p><p>
With a simple
<tt  >sudo sshuttle --dns -vvr username@server 0/0</tt>,
all your traffic will be encrypted and funneled through the remote
server. Because DNS also is tunneled, it means you won't be vulnerable
to DNS poisoning either! Check out sshuttle today. You won't be sorry.

<h2 class="title">Mapping Your GIS Data</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #234, October 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I've already looked at some GIS applications available on
Linux. Programs like GRASS and qgis provide a full set of tools to do
GIS. Sometimes, that's really overkill though. You may just want to display
some
data geographically and create a map. For those cases, there is Thuban,
an interactive geographic data viewer (<a href="http://thuban.intevation.org" target="_self">thuban.intevation.org</a>). 
</p><p>
Most distributions should have
a package available within their package management systems. If not,
you always can download the sources and build it from scratch. It does
depend on Python, among several other libraries, so you need to do
a bit of a dependency dance. Binary downloads even are available
for Windows and Mac OS X, so you can point your non-Linux friends to them.
</p><p>
If you don't already have data of your own, sources of public-domain GIS data
are available on-line. Here are
a couple: <a href="http://www.naturalearthdata.com/features" target="_self">www.naturalearthdata.com/features</a> and <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Shapefiles" target="_self">wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Shapefiles</a>. The files available on these sites will get
you started with SHP files that contain at least basic features for most
of the world. 
</p><p>
Thuban is not as flexible as full-fledged GIS software
and cannot handle very many data file formats. You can use
SHP files, DBF database files and various image file formats. In
the screenshots for this article, I simply grabbed several of the data
files available on-line.
</p><p>
When you start Thuban, you end up with a completely blank
slate (Figure 1). The first step is to start a new session, which
you can do by selecting the menu item File&rarr;New Session (not much
will change on the screen). In order to start building your map, you
need to add layers that can be manipulated. I started by
selecting the menu item Map&rarr;Add Layer and adding in an SHP file
to give me the basic geographic attributes for my home province of New
Brunswick (Figure 2). This includes several different geographical
items, such as water, river banks and parks. The default display is
not very interesting yet (Figure 3). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11563thubanf1.large.jpg"><img src="11563thubanf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Starting Thuban gives you a blank slate.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11563thubanf2.large.jpg"><img src="11563thubanf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Adding a new layer opens a file selection dialog where you can
choose
an SHP file.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11563thubanf3.large.jpg"><img src="11563thubanf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. By default, Thuban just displays all of the data with a single
symbol color.
</p></div></div><p>
You can edit the way a layer
is displayed either by double-clicking the layer within the list in
the legend pane or by right-clicking the layer of interest and selecting
Properties. This will pop up a new window (Figure 4). In this
case, I selected the &ldquo;type&rdquo; field within the classification pane. The
easiest choice at this point is to click the Generate Class button. The
Generate Classification window will pop up, where you can click on the
Retrieve From Table button to get a list of the possible values. I 
accepted the default gray-scale mapping for the colors, giving four new
entries in the layer properties. But this is not very interesting either,
yet. Selecting each of the new properties, you can edit the symbol and
change the colors for each of the types (Figure 5). If you want to
have a preview of what this will look like, you can click the Try
button. If it doesn't quite look right, you always can click the Revert
button to undo the changes and try something else.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11563thubanf4.large.jpg"><img src="11563thubanf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Each layer has a properties window where you can control how the
data gets displayed.

Figure 5. Using the Generate Class button is a shortcut to get you started.
</p></div></div><p>
Although every map begins with a single layer, it is very rare that a
single layer is enough to show all the details you may want to have
displayed. In this example, I don't have any roads on my map. 
A separate SHP file is available that has this information, however. So,
I clicked on the menu item Map&rarr;Add Layer and added the file
roads.shp. Opening up the properties dialog shows that this particular
SHP file has several different attributes to play with. For
now, I selected four different road types and highlighted them with four
different colors. There is still a default color for any road types
other than the four I selected. To make them go away on the map, you can
select the default property and simply make it transparent. Then, only
the four selected road types will show up. Now the map is starting to look
a bit more interesting, and I need to start worrying about what order
the layers are in. 
</p><p>
Thuban will draw layers in the order they appear
in the legend list, starting at the bottom and working its way up. You
can move a particular layer up our down by selecting it and then using
the buttons at the top of the legend pane. 
</p><p>
Another type of layer you can
use is an image layer. Obviously, the image needs to be geo-referenced
in some way. Thuban supports the geoTIFF file format. If you place your
image at the bottom of the layer list, you then can draw on top of it
with the data in the SHP files.
</p><p>
To manipulate the map itself, Thuban uses a sort of mode system. To zoom
in, you need to select the zoom button. Then, you either can use click
and drag to select a region to zoom in on or simply click a spot on the
map to re-center and zoom in. Once you have zoomed in, you can use the
pan tool to move the view window around the map to highlight different
regions. There are buttons to zoom you to specific scales such that
the entire map is visible. This always takes you back to the default map
view. 
</p><p>
Two tools allow you to work with individual elements
from an SHP file. The first is an information tool that pops up a detail
window for any element you select. The second is a label tool. When
you select an element, a dialog window pops up allowing you to select
one of the properties to be displayed as a label.
</p><p>
Once you have a map you're happy with, you probably will want to
save it for later use. Because Thuban works with sessions, all of your
work in generating the map will be saved as a session within Thuban,
as long as you remember to save it by clicking the menu item
File&rarr;Save Session. 
</p><p>
But, this doesn't help much if you want to use your
map outside Thuban. There is an option to export a map as an SVG file
by using the menu item Extensions&rarr;Write SVG Map. This is not the most
efficient output available, however. My simple example here blew
up to more than 50MB for a single map with two layers. 
</p><p>
The other option is to
print your map. Although you can print to actual paper, for a hard copy,
you also can print to a file using the generic PostScript printer. This
generates a PostScript file that will be a bit more manageable. You
also can convert this PostScript file to other formats with relative
ease. So, to get a PDF of your map, you can print to a PostScript file
and then convert it to PDF with the ps2pdf utility. Now you have a map
that you can share with friends and family.
