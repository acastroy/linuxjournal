NVIDIA CUDA</h2></div></div><p>
Version 5.5 is the latest and greatest iteration of NVIDIA CUDA, NVIDIA's
parallel computing platform and programming model that harnesses
the power of GPUs. CUDA 5.5, sayeth NVIDIA, provides programmers
with a robust, easy-to-use platform to develop advanced science,
engineering, mobile and HPC applications on x86 CPU-based systems, and
now on ARM-based ones as well. Beyond native support for ARM platforms,
CUDA 5.5 delivers a number of new advanced performance and productivity
features, including enhanced Hyper-Q support, MPI workload prioritization,
and new guided, step-by-step performance analysis and fast cross-compile on
x86. The latter feature enables developers to compile ARM code on fast
x86 processors and transfer the compiled application to ARM. The v5.5
release also offers a full suite of programming tools, GPU-accelerated
math libraries and documentation for both x86- and ARM-based platforms.

Gumstix's Geppetto Platform</h2></div></div><p>
Gumstix continues to add fire power and options to Geppetto, the company's
modular, drag-and-drop platform for designing and building customized
single-board Linux solutions. The most recent enhancement to Geppetto
involves the addition of the Texas Instruments Sitara AM3354 processor,
which Gumstix says will offer more flexibility to users and
raise Geppetto's ability to enable a rapid go-to-market strategy for its
customers. While designing a board using Geppetto, users simply drag and
drop the processor onto a board and then connect the desired features
to implement it. Fully assembled single-board computers are ordered at
the touch of a button and arrive within 20 business days. Furthermore,
notes Gumstix, Geppetto's support for the Yocto Project build system
makes it easy for developers to create a complete, portable solution
with minimal time and effort.

Dan McCreary and Ann Kelly's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Making Sense of NoSQL</em></span> (Manning Publications)</h2></div></div><p>
NoSQL tools like MongoDB, Neo4j and Redis take innovative approaches to
the unique problems of handling data in modern distributed and Web-based
systems. The new book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Making Sense of NoSQL: A guide for managers and
the rest of us</em></span> by Dan McCreary and Ann Kelly, is a resource for learning
about NoSQL solutions. According to publisher Manning Publications,
the book clearly and concisely explains the concepts, features, benefits,
potential and limitations of NoSQL technologies. Using examples and
use cases, illustrations and plain, jargon-free writing, this guide
shows how one can assemble a NoSQL solution to replace or
augment a traditional RDBMS effectively. After reviewing database concepts alongside
the new NoSQL patterns, authors McCreary and Kelly explore topics including
Big Data, search, reliability, business adaptability, cloud computing,
large CPU-count data centers and customized solutions.

Chris Strom's <span   class="emphasis"><em>3D Game Programming for Kids</em></span> (Pragmatic Programmers)</h2></div></div><p>
What's even better than playing games? Creating your own, of course. And
thus you shall be so empowered if you digest the contents of Chris
Strom's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>3D Game Programming for Kids: Create Interactive Worlds
with JavaScript</em></span>. Targeted at younger readers, Strom's book illustrates
how to create on-line games. Using nothing more than a browser and the
language of the Web, JavaScript, readers will learn programming and
visualize cool, 3-D results as they type. To make things easier for
beginners, the kid-friendly ICE Code Editor was created especially for
this book. Want a red donut? Make hundreds of them, spinning around like
crazy, right next to the entered code. Readers can create games quickly
by focusing on the project-based lessons. If they want to go further
and understand the theory or mathematical functions, they can turn to
the chapters that explain the programming concepts.

Directory Wizards Inc.'s UnitySync</h2></div></div><p>
Into the big Linux tent we welcome Directory Wizards, whose UnitySync
solution is now available on the Linux platform. UnitySync is a
centralized service that synchronizes data between directories so that
organizations enjoy a unified view of their disparate directories. Our
sources at Directory Wizards say that UnitySync can scale from small
directories with hundreds of objects to enterprise directories consisting
of hundreds of thousands of objects without requiring extensive training
or installation/configuration time. UnitySync users can synchronize
account information between different directories so that each directory
contains a unified view of the other non-connected directories. In
addition, users can define authoritative data sources, enabling one
system to update individual attributes of existing objects of another. No
scripting, programming or extra databases are required. The Windows Intel
32-bit platform also is supported.

Coraid ZX4000 File Storage Appliance</h2></div></div><p>
Public cloud scalability, economics and resilience models are three
macroforces affecting IT. Storage specialist Coraid's response to these
trends is the new ZX4000 File Storage Appliance, a storage building-block
solution for both enterprise and cloud deployments that combines Flash
performance, multi-petabyte scale and distributed resilience. Coraid
suggests that the ZX solution's unique architecture allows for a
potentially limitless pool of elastic, shared, block storage that
easily scales performance via the addition of more ZX appliances.
The ZX4000 can be deployed in a resilient architecture that offers
protection against up to three shelf or drive failures while retaining
high storage efficiencies of around 80%. This enterprise-class
storage solution, says Coraid, is available at a cost comparable to
consumer-grade public cloud services and at a fraction of the cost
of legacy NAS storage. Since its introduction in 2012, the ZX product
line has been deployed by customers in a wide variety of applications
including backup, public and private clouds, and media.

The Document Foundation's LibreOffice</h2></div></div><p>
The Document Foundation proudly calls its new LibreOffice 4.1 office suite
&ldquo;not only the best but also the most interoperable free office suite
ever&rdquo;. The 4.1 milestone release features a large number of improvements
in the area of document compatibility, which increases the opportunities
of sharing knowledge with users of proprietary software while retaining
the original layout and contents. Numerous improvements have been made to
Microsoft OOXML import and export filters, as well as to legacy Microsoft
Office and RTF file filters. Other new interoperability-focused features
include font embedding in Writer, Calc, Impress and Draw and import and
export functions new in Excel 2013 for ODF OpenFormula compatibility.

MWR InfoSecurity's drozer</h2></div></div><p>
The Android security testing framework formerly known as Mercury&mdash;and
now called drozer&mdash;was released recently by MWR InfoSecurity. With
drozer, companies using Android mobile devices now can safeguard
their assets and IT infrastructure by running full, dynamic security
assessments. A new drozer feature is the ability to compromise Android
devices through publicly available exploits, something that helps
organizations understand how a technical vulnerability on a mobile device
can become a real threat to their business. Drozer unifies these publicly
available exploits into a single framework and improves the quality of the
exploitation code and payloads available to the penetration tester. Drozer
provides support for any Android device running Android 2.1 and beyond,
covering 99% of the devices in the market. The open-source tool is
available to download from the MWR Labs Web site.
