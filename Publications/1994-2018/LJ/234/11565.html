Designing a responsive Web site? Zurb Foundation is a worthy competitor to
Twitter Bootstrap.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcf0580.0xde83b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I was recently speaking with a new client about a consulting project,
and we were discussing the technologies we were going to use. I
said, &ldquo;So, I assume that we'll be using Twitter Bootstrap as a CSS
framework, right?&rdquo; Bootstrap, of course, is the open-source CSS
framework written in the LESS language that recently released its
third version, which has become wildly popular among Web
developers. I've used Bootstrap on a number of projects in the past
few years, and I've been pleasantly surprised to discover just how
easily I could implement layouts, menus and sidebars, as well as
produce nice-looking tables and buttons.
</p><p>
I was surprised when the client said, &ldquo;No, we're actually using Zurb
Foundation.&rdquo; Now, I had heard of Foundation before. Zurb is a Web
design company based in California, whose Foundation framework
preceded and inspired Bootstrap in many ways. But it really hadn't
registered much on my radar, and I hadn't paid much attention to it.
It turns out that I should have been paying attention. Zurb is a
worthy competitor to Bootstrap, and it has some advantages that make it
more appropriate in some cases.
</p><p>
So in this article, I take a look at Zurb Foundation, considering it both
as a standalone CSS framework and as something you can use from within
an application framework, such as Ruby on Rails. Zurb recently
released version 4 of the Foundation framework, and although it is not as
popular as Bootstrap, the people who are using it seem to be
quite passionate about its advantages.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcf0580.0xde86c8"></a>
Foundation Basics</h2></div></div><p>
If you aren't yet familiar with CSS frameworks, the idea is pretty
straightforward. When you want to lay out a Web application, you 
likely will want some headlines, some text, some sidebars, a menu and all
sorts of other design elements. You could design the entirety of the
layout, classes and CSS from scratch each time. Or, you could use
predefined styles, designed to work with all sites, with a great deal
of flexibility.
</p><p>
Each modern CSS framework functions in this same way. You put text
into divs and give each div a class indicating how many columns
across it should be, up to the maximum number of columns defined by
the framework. Foundation offers 12 columns, meaning that you can lay
out your design in one very wide column, two equally sized columns
(6+6) or even something wilder, such as 3+4+5.
</p><p>
Foundation, like other modern frameworks, goes way beyond just
providing you with a nice grid. It also gives you control over
navigation elements and forms, and even gives you some
JavaScript-based elements for displaying images and dialog boxes.
</p><p>
The bulk of Foundation is implemented using SCSS, a modern
implementation of SASS. SCSS is a superset of CSS that can be
compiled (using an open-source tool) into regular CSS files. However,
you don't need to know SCSS in order to use Foundation.
</p><p>
How can you use Zurb Foundation? Download the package. You have
several options, but the easiest one is to use the precompiled CSS
files. Go to the Zurb Foundation download site at
<a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/download.php" target="_self">foundation.zurb.com/download.php</a>,
and from there, click on the button for &ldquo;download Foundation CSS&rdquo;.
</p><p>
If you want to change the defaults, you could download the SCSS
version and do it that way. Alternatively, the good people at Zurb
have provided a Web-based selection system, such that you can indicate
what parts of Foundation you want, as well as which colors and styles.
The CSS that you download then will be precompiled, customized
according to your needs.
</p><p>
If you download the simple CSS version and open the resulting zipfile,
a sample HTML page (index.html) will be at the top level of the
folders. There also will be several subfolders, whose names are
fairly self-explanatory: js (JavaScript), css (stylesheets) and img
(images).
</p><p>
Looking at the HTML page, you can see that Foundation is loaded in
five steps:
</p><p>
1) First, you load the core Foundation CSS file:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/foundation.css"&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Now, this is definitely a long and complex CSS file. However,
remember that this defines all of the styles, for all of the
aspects of Foundation. Moreover, this is the result of
translating the SCSS source into CSS; expressed as SCSS, the file
is much shorter and easier to understand.
</p><p>
2) After loading the Foundation CSS file, you then load Modernizr.
I've covered Modernizr in this column before; it allows you to
test for certain HTML5 features and use alternatives if the
feature doesn't exist. You can use Modernizr in your application
if you wish, but it's loaded here so that Foundation can handle
different browser versions.
</p><p>
3) Next, you load the JavaScript for Foundation. But here, things get
a bit more interesting. Rather than a &lt;script&gt; tag that loads a
JavaScript library, Foundation allows you to use either jQuery or
Zepto, a lightweight library that copies many of jQuery's most
popular features. Foundation tests, at runtime, whether the
__proto__ property is defined on an empty object ({}). If so,
it loads Zepto. If not, it loads jQuery. This is where
copying the code that comes with Foundation is probably the best
choice; just make sure that when you deploy your application, you
have both Zepto and jQuery available.

</p><p>
4) Load the Foundation JavaScript file itself, which gives you the
capabilities you wanted.
</p><p>
5) Activate Foundation, using the formula by invoking the
&ldquo;foundation&rdquo; function on the document object. This syntax works
with both jQuery and Zepto:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$(document).foundation();
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that although steps 1 and 2 take place in the &lt;head&gt; section of the
HTML file, the remaining steps (which involve JavaScript) are placed
at the bottom of the page, just before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag. This
is a common technique for speeding up JavaScript execution, and
it ensures that the browser parses and displays the page before loading
and executing external JavaScript files.
</p><p>
A minimal file that uses Zurb Foundation (with a &ldquo;Hello world&rdquo;
headline and paragraph in the body) is shown in Listing 1.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcf0580.0xde9010"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. Hello, world</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Minimal Zurb Foundation file&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/foundation.css" /&gt;
  &lt;script src="js/vendor/custom.modernizr.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world headline&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hello, world paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    document.write('&lt;script src=' +
                   ('__proto__' in {} ? 'js/vendor/zepto' :
                   'js/vendor/jquery') + '.js&gt;&lt;\/script&gt;')
    &lt;/script&gt;

    &lt;script src="js/foundation.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      $(document).foundation();
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcf0580.0xde9220"></a>
Layouts with Foundation</h2></div></div><p>
If you look at the file in Listing 1 in your browser, you might well
be disappointed by how it looks. The text is too close to the edge of
the page, and it doesn't have any of the pizazz that you would have
expected from a framework. Well, there's a simple reason for this. It
hasn't used any of the styles that Foundation provides.
</p><p>
So, let's begin by putting the text inside a &lt;div&gt; with a class
of &ldquo;row&rdquo;. That shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who has used
Bootstrap or other CSS frameworks; they often work this way, and
also use a &ldquo;row&rdquo; class to indicate that you're now enclosing one
horizontal band of text. The &lt;body&gt; (without the Foundation-specific
JavaScript), thus, will look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world headline&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello, world paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
If you reload your browser, you'll see that the text has moved closer
to the center of the page. That's because using the &ldquo;row&rdquo; class has
defined margins, as well as allowed your content to be more centered
and more responsive. While you're at it, make your window
smaller. At a certain point, the text will make itself smaller,
changing (on my computer, at least) from 2.75em to 2.15em. The idea,
of course, is that people with smaller browser windows still should be
able to see as much text as possible, and that the text should adjust
itself proportionally.
</p><p>
Of course, your sites generally will include more text than just
&ldquo;Hello, world.&rdquo; I'll add some dummy text inside the paragraph, so
that it takes up a few lines. But this time, I don't want the text to
extend all the way to the right side. Rather, I want it to take up
only half the screen.
</p><p>
Foundation makes that easy to do. Create a new &lt;div&gt; tag, and give
it two classes. First, give it one that represents the number of columns (out
of 12) that you want your text to use. So to extend all the way across,
you would say large-12. To extend halfway across, you would say large-6, and
to extend one quarter of the way across, you would use large-3. (If columns
within a row don't add up to 12, you can get some funny-looking
results.) Second, you add the &ldquo;columns&rdquo; class, allowing Foundation to
display your site using appropriate columns. Given these, the text
looks like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="large-6 columns"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world headline&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello, world paragraph. And even more hello, world. And
    even even more more hello, world. And so on, and so forth. 
    And again. And even more hello, world. And even even more
    hello, world. And so on, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
If you want two side-by-side columns, you easily can do that:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="large-6 columns"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world headline&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello, world paragraph. And even more hello, world. 
    And even even more more hello, world. And so on, and 
    so forth. And again. And even more hello, world. And 
    even even more more hello, world. And so on, 
    and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="large-6 columns"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world headline&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello, world paragraph. And even more hello, world.  
    And even even more more hello, world. And so on, and 
    so forth. And again. And even more hello, world. And 
    even even more more hello, world. And so on, 
    and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
And, if you want both paragraphs of text under the same headline, you can
do that as well:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world from a long headline&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;div class="large-6 columns"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello, world paragraph. And even more hello, world.  
    And even even more more hello, world. And so on, and 
    so forth. And again. And even more hello, world. And 
    even even more more hello, world. And so on, and 
    so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="large-6 columns"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello, world paragraph. And even more hello, world.  
    And even even more more hello, world. And so on, and 
    so forth. And again. And even more hello, world. And 
    even even more more hello, world. And so on, and 
    so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Now, could you have accomplished this on your own? Of course. But
everyone who ever has worked with CSS knows it can be difficult
to get this right. Moreover, what happens when someone wants to
browse this site with a smartphone or a small browser window? Zurb
Foundation is responsive, meaning that it adjusts automatically. This
means that although you might have defined your paragraphs to be
side by side, Foundation is smart enough to stack them vertically if
the browser window is too narrow. You can see this for yourself by
changing the width of your browser window with this page.
</p><p>
It gets even better. Perhaps you want narrow browser windows, such as
those used on cell phones, to continue displaying the columns side by
side. This is where Foundation's &ldquo;dual grid&rdquo; layout system
shines.
Just as you can use large-* classes for large browser windows, you can
use small-* classes for small windows. Foundation automatically
will apply the appropriate class, making it responsive in multiple ways.
This means that each div will look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;div class="large-6 small-3 columns"&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Foundation also provides a number of button styles. You can use these
in forms or by themselves for actions that you'll then hook up with
JavaScript callbacks. A simple button can be given the &ldquo;button&rdquo;
class:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;input class="button" value="Press me" /&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
You can use classes to change the button's size (tiny, small, medium
or large), color (secondary, alert or success) or even rounded
corners (with a &ldquo;round&rdquo; class). The documentation indicated that
&ldquo;radius&rdquo; should work as well as round, but it didn't operate correctly
within my Chrome browser window. You can combine these classes, such
as in:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;input class="button success large round" value="Press me" /&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Buttons in Foundation handle hovering nicely as well, such that moving
the mouse cursor over a button dims it, and clicking on it also gives
visual feedback. Again, these are things you could do on your
own, but why bother, when Foundation already has defined it?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcf0580.0x11e2078"></a>
Navigation</h2></div></div><p>
Most sites on which I work need to have a top navigation bar.
Foundation handles this easily as well. For example, let's say you
want to have a title on the top navigation bar, and then links to pages
2, 3 and 4 of your site.
</p><p>
Doing this is a bit trickier than what you've seen so far, in that it
requires some additional elements. Because I'm using HTML5 for this example,
let's 
take advantage of two special elements defined there, &lt;nav&gt; and
&lt;section&gt;, which Foundation expects.
</p><p>
The top-level navigation bar is defined in a &lt;nav&gt; element with a
class of &ldquo;nav-bar&rdquo;. Within that, you start a &lt;ul&gt; element, normally
used for bulleted lists, with a class of &ldquo;title-area&rdquo;. Now the magic
begins. If you create an &lt;li&gt; element with classes of &ldquo;name&rdquo; and
&ldquo;active&rdquo;, the navbar now will have a title. It's typical to put that
name in an h1 tag, and then to put the enclosed text inside a link,
so that people can navigate to your organization's home page:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;nav class="top-bar"&gt;
  &lt;ul class="title-area"&gt;
    &lt;li class="name active"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Test site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
You then can have one or more menu items, with the items flush left
(with the title) or right (with the right side of the browser). Here,
I've chosen to align it to the right. My menu items all go within a
&lt;section&gt; tag, with the class of &ldquo;top-bar-section&rdquo;, and then an inner
&lt;ul&gt;, with a class of &ldquo;right&rdquo; (indicating the alignment I want) and
containing the menu items on the right side. The result looks like
this:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;nav class="top-bar"&gt;
  &lt;ul class="title-area"&gt;
    &lt;li class="name"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Test site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;section class="top-bar-section"&gt;
      &lt;ul class="right"&gt;
        &lt;li class="active"&gt;&lt;a href="2.html"&gt;Page2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class="active"&gt;&lt;a href="3.html"&gt;Page3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class="active"&gt;&lt;a href="4.html"&gt;Page4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
You can get even fancier if you want. Put the entire &lt;nav&gt; element
inside a &lt;div&gt; whose class is &ldquo;fixed&rdquo;, and the navigation bar will
stay at the top of the screen.
</p><p>
Finally, your navigation bar may include drop-down menus. If, for
example, you want the &ldquo;page4&rdquo; link to be a menu, add the
&ldquo;has-dropdown&rdquo; class to the &lt;li&gt; tag. Then, within the &lt;li&gt;,
add a new &lt;ul&gt; with a class of &ldquo;dropdown&rdquo;. The inner &lt;li&gt; elements
then will be treated as menu items. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;li class="has-dropdown"&gt;&lt;a href="4.html"&gt;Page4&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;ul class="dropdown"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="4.html"&gt;Page4a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="4.html"&gt;Page4b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="4.html"&gt;Page4c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Not only will the above function as a nice top-level menu, but the
Foundation CSS definitions also will place a down-arrow hint next to the
&ldquo;Page4&rdquo; label, showing the user that this is a menu, rather than an
individual menu option.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
It's easy to see why Zurb Foundation has become popular. It offers
many of the positional and navigational advantages of other CSS
frameworks, allows easy customization with SCSS (although I didn't
demonstrate that in this column), and perhaps best of all, it allows you
to design your site simultaneously for large and small screens. If
you're designing an application that needs to work on mobile devices,
I definitely would consider Zurb Foundation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcf0580.0x11e2a18"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

The home page for Zurb Foundation is <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com" target="_self">foundation.zurb.com</a>.
That site has good documentation and examples.
</p><p>
A nice introduction to Foundation, albeit looking at the previous
version from 2012, is at

</p><p>
I also found it useful to read a comparison of Foundation with
Bootstrap at
<a href="http://abetteruserexperience.com/2013/08/twitter-bootstrap-3-vs-foundation-4-which-one-should-you-use" target="_self">abetteruserexperience.com/2013/08/twitter-bootstrap-3-vs-foundation-4-which-one-should-you-use</a>.
</p><p>
Finally, customization of Foundation is done with SCSS. You can read
my previous articles on the subject, or go to the SASS Web site (which
describes both the SASS and SCSS syntaxes) at <a href="http://sass-lang.com" target="_self">sass-lang.com</a>.
