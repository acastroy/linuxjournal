The Personal Cloud gives you access and control over your own data and lets you
do more with it than your vendors can. Who wouldn't want that? The
question is, how do we get there from here?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19c8580.0x1ac02a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Personal.</em></span>
</p><p>
What do you say when someone asks &ldquo;How much money do you
make?&rdquo;, or &ldquo;How
old are you?&rdquo;, or &ldquo;How much do you weigh?&rdquo;, or &ldquo;What is
your address?&rdquo; The
quintessential response &ldquo;that's personal&rdquo; works because of an underlying
assumption that we are within our rights to withhold that information and,
more important, that privacy is the default and natural state of affairs.
There is no government procedure on reaching the age of majority requiring
you to check boxes on an interminably long list, enumerating all of the
personal data attributes that you choose to keep private. As a sovereign
person, they are all considered private. It is your choice whether to
reveal your income, age, weight or any other piece of personal information.
The ubiquity of the phrase &ldquo;that's personal&rdquo; speaks to a broadly shared
understanding that we get to choose what information about ourselves we
reveal and to whom we reveal it. 
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Cloud.</em></span>
</p><p>
There is no industry-standard definition of the term &ldquo;cloud&rdquo;, but we
should at least all be able to agree on a few attributes. Many of these
are optional depending on who you talk to, but the one essential element of
the cloud is abstraction. An observer sees the cloud as a single logical
thing with which to interact and need not be concerned with the individual
elements that make up the cloud.
</p><p>
In addition, a cloud will have one or more of the following elements:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Elasticity: computing resources can be allocated dynamically to match
variable load.
</p></li><li><p>
Redundancy: the use of multiple physical servers increases the
availability of the cloud service.
</p></li><li><p>
Resiliency: the cloud service can survive interruption or loss of some
physical components without loss of function.
</p></li><li><p>
Runtime resolution: resource identities and addresses are resolved
dynamically.
</p></li><li><p>
Ubiquity: some clouds are public while others are private. However they
are scoped, a cloud service is expected to be accessible from all points
within that scope.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
By incorporating these elements, cloud architecture aims to deliver
computing services that are as reliable and available as power or water.
The ultimate expression of the cloud is that the computing infrastructure
completely disappears except for the user interface.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Personal Cloud.</em></span>
</p><p>
Imagine a cloud database filled with information about you and a vendor
inquiring of that cloud &ldquo;How much money do you make? How old are you? How
much do you weigh? What is your address?&rdquo; Whether the cloud is personal
or not depends on who gets to decide the answers to these questions. It is
not enough that the response back is &ldquo;that's personal&rdquo; if someone else
can override your preferences and make the disclosure anyway. It is only a
Personal Cloud if you have ultimate control over whether to disclose that
information.
</p><p>
A Personal Cloud starts with the assumption that privacy is the default and
natural state of affairs and then incorporates that design philosophy into
a cloud computing architecture owned and operated by an
individual.
</p><p>
Resist the temptation to read more into that statement than there is. For
example, there is no requirement that a Personal Cloud must be self-hosted.
Today there are commercial services for password management, storage,
backups, VoIP, chat and more, all of which fit the definition of Personal
Cloud. In all these cases, the custodians of the data have no access to it.
Instead, they provide the framework in which the data owner sets policies
that express the relationship between the data and any third parties
authorized to access it. If it is a cloud architecture, respects the
owner's privacy, and the owner is the ultimate authority over
authorization decisions, it is a Personal Cloud.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19c8580.0x1ac0fb8"></a>
Not a Buzzword</h2></div></div><p>
Much of the buzz about cloud computing is just that&mdash;buzz. But Personal
Cloud is more. There is a parallel here with the way we purchase motive
power. In San Francisco, halfway down the hill on Mason Street, there are
giant motors transferring motive power to cables, which in turn run below
the street to distribute that motive power along the cable car routes.
When the cable car requires motive power, it gets it directly from the
cable. Many years ago, factories worked the same way. Large motors
distributed motive power to belts and pulleys that distributed it
throughout the factory. 
</p><p>
But that method didn't scale very well. There is no tap from your house
to an underground cable that provides power for washers and dryers,
refrigerators and so on. Nor is there a giant motor in the back yard and a
system of pulleys and belts running from it to the house. Instead, we
self-host hundreds of tiny motors, invisibly built in to disk drives, DVD
players, appliances, clocks and almost everything capable of movement.
The magic of this is that we don't think of these things as motors that
wash clothes, tell time or spin digital media. The motors have receded
into the background, and we rarely think about them at all, unless they
break. 
</p><p>
The same thing is happening now with computing. There is more computing
capacity in the average modern phone than there was in the Lunar Lander. It's
everywhere around you, and more is on the way. All of your devices that
have an embedded motor soon will have embedded computing power, if they do
not already. Things that currently have no motor or computing
power&mdash;switches, outlets and bulbs, for example&mdash;soon will become smart. More
important, all of these sensors, devices and computing platforms are
increasingly interconnected and integrated with if-then-else rules engines
that correlate events to generate complex behaviors in formerly dumb
devices. Sensors, actuators and computing power are quietly but inexorably
being woven into the fabric of your life. 
</p><p>
Is it reasonable to assume that with all this computing power available to
individuals that we will fail to apply it in commercial settings for our
own benefit, in much the same way that our vendors have applied it on the
supply side? The value proposition of E-Commerce, Supply Chain
Management and Customer Relationship Management always applied to
individual users. We never delivered it to that market because of cost, but
that barrier continues to fall. These applications radically transformed
commerce on a global scale when they were first built out by large
enterprises. We have the opportunity to transform commerce again, with
even greater impact, by building out business functionality on the consumer
side. Or we could continue to focus on making better versions of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Angry
Birds</em></span> and moving light switches from the wall to the phone. 
</p><p>
Today's architecture, in which vendors have all the data and computing
power, is a dying relic, left over from a world where computing was
specialized and so expensive that only large businesses could afford
it.
It is the cable car wheelhouse or the big motor out back behind the
factory. But in a world of cheap and abundant computing power,
individuals are the natural points of integration for their own data. Now we
have the choice to continue on with the legacy model or to move to a new
model in which the individual's computing capacity improves the experience
of both the individual and the vendor. Having all that computing power on
the consumer side and not building out new business integration seems to me
to be akin to ripping the motors out of all the disk drives, DVD players,
clocks, refrigerators and other appliances, and equipping them with belts
and pulleys. You could do it, but it doesn't scale and you won't like the
experience.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19c8580.0x1ac12d0"></a>
Impersonal Clouds</h2></div></div><p>
Let's revisit that cloud database filled with information about you and a
vendor inquiring of that cloud &ldquo;How much money do you make? How old are
you? What is your address?&rdquo; If that cloud is owned by a credit bureau or
data broker, the responses will be the actual values. There is no default
assumption of privacy. You have no say in how much data about you these
commercial entities hold, whether it is accurate or with whom they share
it. The entire business model of data brokers is to provide answers for
questions to which, if you had been asked in person, you would have
responded by saying &ldquo;that's personal&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The impersonal cloud also hoards your data, preventing you from deriving
any benefit from it. If you participate in a grocery loyalty program,
somewhere out there is a database containing line-item records all your
purchases. That's a rather intimate level of detail about you and your
immediate household. If someone on the street asked you detailed questions
about some of those line items, you undoubtedly would say &ldquo;that's
personal&rdquo;.
If that same person then offered to pay you a dollar for
details of which personal hygiene products you use and how often you buy
them, it would seem creepy. But that is exactly the kind of information we
give out in exchange for a dollar off of a jug of milk.
</p><p>
I've been told that the average person has no use for grocery line-item
data. If that is true (and I don't believe that it is), it's only
because we do not yet have access to that data and, therefore, have not
written applications to use it. We don't know now what we'll do with
that data any more than we could have looked at HTTP in 1983 and predicted
Web 2.0. What we do know now though is that all the data is held by
vendors, and wherever it is that Personal Cloud can take us, we can't get
there from here. Getting access to our own data is the first step.
Personal Cloud is Cloud 2.0.

Strategies for Personal Cloud Development</h2></div></div><p>
Twenty years from now, we will know what the Personal Cloud equivalents of
Google, Wikipedia, YouTube, Facebook and Instagram are, and they will seem
obvious in hindsight. But if you want to get started in Personal Cloud
today, where do you place your bets? Although the specific implementations
have yet to be revealed&mdash;that's your job&mdash;we do know some general
directions with a high degree of confidence. First and foremost among
these is that the Personal Cloud wants to be invisible. Once the user sets
up the connection and preferences, the fact that the apps are backed by a
Personal Cloud should not normally be evident to the user. The exceptions
exist mainly where the Personal Cloud provides enhanced functionality, such
as prompting the user for permission to release information. Other than
those exceptions, all the user should see is the exposed functionality. 
</p><p>
Some additional Personal Cloud directions are listed below. The strategy
for deriving these is to imagine a future state where privacy is baked into
the architecture and where sharing is enabled by policy. This is the
opposite of today's model where the architecture is built for sharing and
privacy is provided by policy. Also, assume a future state where
individuals have access to all the transaction data their vendors currently
collect, and to the data from all their devices, and that all of this is
accessible to the user in aggregate through their Personal Cloud. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Software</b></span> &mdash; Extend Supply Chain management systems all the way to the
consumer so that the merchant is the next-to-last rather than the last stop
in the chain. The opportunity here is to create the API of Me and My
Things and to assist large Enterprise to understand the value in
integrating with it. Considerable momentum already exists in Vendor
Relationship Management applications, the consumer counterpart to Customer
Relationship Management. In short, re-imagine business software as owned
and operated by and for the individual.
</p><p>
There are a number of initiatives and groups working to provide
infrastructure and resources to further these concepts. The
unsurprisingly named Privacy By Design framework &ldquo;advances the view that
the future of privacy cannot be assured solely by compliance with
legislation and regulatory frameworks; rather, privacy assurance must
become an organization's default mode of operation&rdquo;. The Personal Data
Ecosystem Consortium's mission is to connect entrepreneurs and startups
focused on user-centric personal data, advocate for individuals' rights to
tools and access to their own data, and to help existing businesses
dependent on the old personal data ecosystem transform to become profitable
in the new one. The Respect Network extends the basic connectivity of the
Internet with a community and context for trusted identity and interactions
between people, businesses and devices. There is a growing collection of
information, references and index of projects related specifically to
Personal Cloud at Personal-Clouds.org. The folks at Kynetx have built and
implemented CloudOS and an event network that are up and running today and
built on the Personal Cloud philosophy. This is a non-inclusive list but
will jump-start your investigation into Personal Clouds. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Data aggregation and integration</b></span> &mdash; Much of the value of data lies in the
ability to correlate and analyze across many datasets to find valuable
relationships. For example, consumers can participate in cradle-to-cradle
tracking of recyclable resources by integrating data from their purchasing,
waste and recycle streams. Add Health data to the mix for insight into
how dietary purchasing habits affect wellness. Integrate power and water
consumption for a total household greenness rating. But, which vendor will
collect and manage all this information for you? 
</p><p>
Mint.com aggregates all your financial accounts into a single view but
probably won't be adding your health records, power and grocery loyalty
information any time soon, nor would you want it to. If Mint.com began
asking for your health and grocery data, you probably would tell it
&ldquo;that's personal&rdquo;.
The Personal Cloud version of an aggregator operates
more like FileThis.com. FileThis periodically fetches your bank
statements, e-bills and purchase receipts, then loads them into a data
store that you control. It never stores the information it collects on
your behalf nor does it attempt to provide any analysis or presentation of
that data. You supply the credentials and the storage, it supplies the
integration.
</p><p>
Apart from a few early examples, this field is wide open. Every loyalty
program, interactive heath service, government-hosted citizen database,
social-media service, utility provider, identity provider, bookmark sync
service, contact list or other service that holds your information is a
candidate either to aggregate that data into a single view or pull it
into the individual's Personal Cloud. If those services hope to remain
competitive, they will recognize the value in empowering individuals to
access their own data and begin to cooperate with integrators and publish
APIs.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Hosted apps and plugins</b></span> &mdash; hosting providers cannot process your data
if they cannot see it. If you are to get any value out of the data you
choose to keep private, you will need something that you control to
correlate, analyze and visualize it. One approach, exemplified by
OwnCloud,
is a framework made up of database hosting, a plugin architecture and
APIs. Out of the box, the system supplies cloud storage, calendaring,
contact lists, music streaming and on-line photo galleries. But the real
power is in the plugin architecture and APIs. For example, there is no
personal health vault in the basic version of OwnCloud, but that 
easily could be added.
</p><p>
Alternatively, some Personal Cloud applications will run standalone.
Consider the FileThis service mentioned previously. Among the other
accounts to which it integrates, it can download your bank statements.
But this requires you to give it your on-line banking credentials, which is
a bit problematic. That issue would go away if you could run its
application locally. The standalone app model provides all the benefits
of the vendor's integration know-how without exposing your banking account
credentials.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Retro-fit</b></span> &mdash; There are a lot of
&ldquo;dumb&rdquo; appliances out there with plenty
of useful life in them. Similarly, there are very few existing houses
wired for data or that have their own Personal Cloud servers. If we
imagine a future world where all those devices are smart, how do we get
from here to there? One way might be to take the Crutchfield approach and
apply it to the Internet of Things. 
</p><p>
Crutchfield built an unlikely business by betting that ordinary people
could and would install high-end stereos into their own cars if they had
access to tools and instructions. Crutchfield provided custom wiring
harnesses that eliminated most of the complexity, access to tools and
comprehensive instructions from an exhaustive database of vehicle makes and
models. The bet paid off and it grew into a formidable player in the
consumer audio business. 
</p><p>
A similar model would work for Internet-enabling dumb devices. Assuming
that you had the appropriate wiring harness, a Wi-Fi-enabled Arduino or
Digispark could be dropped into a washer, dryer, refrigerator or other
appliance in minutes. This could jump-start the Internet of Things and
most of the research could be crowdsourced. There are business
opportunities in performing the installations and in providing the code
that sends and receives events from the devices and turns those into more
complex behaviors. Of course, getting a data fabric into the home is a
prerequisite, so the installation of home-automation servers, cabling,
power-over-Ethernet and Wi-Fi access points also will be a growth
opportunity.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19c8580.0x1eb9f70"></a>
Stupid Cloud Tricks</h2></div></div><p>
To seed your mind with ideas for Personal Cloud development, imagine a
world in which the most mundane objects and surfaces are smart and in which
you can program behaviors based on interactions of devices and events in
your life. The cloud also has access to all your transaction and
demographic data, location and preferences. Now combine these in the most
far-fetched way that you can think of. 
</p><p>
Here's an example. My smart house would have individually
addressable path lighting throughout. My dog would have an NFC or
Bluetooth beacon on his collar so that the house could know exactly where
he is. I would then program a behavior causing the path lighting to follow
him around the house. Once he got used to that, I would train him that
following the path lighting cues would lead to a reward. The last step
would be to create a phone app (I'll call it &ldquo;Fetch&rdquo;) that leads the dog
from wherever he is in the house to wherever I am.
</p><p>
I admit this is a very stupid cloud trick. I criticized vendors for moving
wall switches to phone apps, and I just did the same thing with the dog.
The point is that if you own the data and your devices talk first to you
instead of the vendor, you are not constrained by the vendor's choice of
integrations and can invent weird and wonderful behaviors for your stuff.
(But you have to admit that a phone app that remotely controls the dog is
kinda cool.) So let's try something a bit more practical. 
</p><p>
Your power company has a rate plan that lets it shut off your water
heater and air conditioner when it or a neighboring utility has a peak
load shortage. But why limit this to water heaters and air conditioners?
When the home is filled with smart devices, it will be possible for lights,
fans, battery chargers or any powered device to take part in discretionary
load abatement. For example, on receiving an abatement request, an LED
bulb (or the dashboard controlling that bulb) might respond with an offer
to cut 10% of its current drain during the abatement period. Because the
house knows whether anyone is home, the degree of abatement can vary
automatically and accordingly. You don't have to honor the pledge and can
turn the light back up, but the closer your house gets to its projected
abatement, the larger the rebate you get.
</p><p>
With enough devices participating, discretionary load abatement will allow
us to defer the need to build more power plants. But this considers only
the first-tier effects. The system really gets interesting when social
aspects are added. Your Personal Cloud knows how much load abatement you
have provided, what your baseline usage is and the normal interior
conditions in the house. Someone eventually will combine these into a
competitive social app where individuals or groups can compete for energy-efficiency badges. How do you compare with your neighborhood? Your
region? Households with similar demographics? Can your scout troop be the
greenest in the pack? 
</p><p>
What will your Stupid Cloud Tricks be? Feel free to dream some up and send
them to <a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>. Or just wait a few years and create them for real.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19c8580.0x1eba338"></a>
Personal Cloud = Opportunity</h2></div></div><p>
These types of applications are not only possible but trivial when we all
have access to our own data and are not dependent on vendors for the
integrations. Personal Cloud detractors claim that individuals have shown
no interest in having access to their own data. Until PRISM, many said we
have no interest in privacy either. But this is not a question of whether
Personal Clouds will exist or whether individuals need or want access to
their own data. Technology seeps into every niche that will support it, and
this is hardly a niche. When the value of Personal Cloud apps exceeds
their cost, they will flourish. It really is that simple. 
</p><p>
The market for Personal Clouds is a superset of that for mobile phones,
game consoles, NAS devices, home-entertainment servers and home-automation
servers because they are all potentially participants. That is a very
large market, which with regard to Personal Cloud, is as yet untouched.
Those who can make the value of Personal Cloud exceed the cost (as measured
in currency, skill requirement and administrative overhead) can begin to
carve out their own piece of that very large pie. 
</p><p>
Would you like your piece of that pie now? For more information on
Personal Clouds and the ecosystem growing up around them, please visit the
