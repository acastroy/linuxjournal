don't work right the first time, and thus need to be &ldquo;debugged&rdquo;.
The easiest way to debug a Tcl program is with the
<b  >puts</b> command.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
puts stderr "Some useful information to print"
</pre><p>A few carefully placed <b  >puts</b> statements can
be used to ferret out most bugs. Unfortunately, it often seems the
bugs have a habit of returning as soon as the
<b  >puts</b> statements are removed.</p><p>The solution to the recurring bug problem is to wrap
<b  >puts</b> in a procedure, called
<b  >dputs</b>, so we can turn debug printing on or off
without changing the code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
proc dputs {args} {
  global Debug
  if {[info exists Debug]} {
     puts stderr $args
  }
}
</pre><p>This first version of <b  >dputs</b> checks to see
if the global variable <b  >Debug</b> is set (to
anything) before printing the arguments passed to
<b  >dputs</b>. As a side benefit,
<b  >dputs</b> lets us specify what to print as multiple
arguments. The <b  >args</b> parameter, which is special
in Tcl, automatically gathers all of the arguments of
<b  >dputs</b> into a single string.</p><p>Although <b  >dputs</b> is an improvement over
<b  >puts</b>, it doesn't take too long to discover the
limitation of this version. You have the choice of either too
little output or too much. What we would like to do is turn debug
printing on or off selectively, in different sections of the
program.</p><p>We can use the introspective capabilities of Tcl to determine
which procedure each <b  >dputs</b> is being called from,
and turn debug printing on or off for each procedure. We'll use the
<b  >info level</b> command to look into the current
procedure stack and figure out the name of the procedure that
<b  >dputs</b> is being called from. We can set
<b  >Debug</b> to a glob-style pattern that will cause
only those <b  >dputs</b> statements in procedures that
match that pattern to print. As a bonus, we'll print the calling
procedure name as part of our output, so it doesn't have to be
included as an argument to <b  >dputs</b>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
proc dputs {args} {
  global Debug
  if {![info exists Debug]} return
  set current [expr [info level] - 1]
  set caller toplevel
  catch {
    set caller [lindex [info level $current] 0]
  }
  if {[string match $Debug $caller]} {
    puts stderr "$caller: $args"
  }
}
</pre><p>In this version of <b  >dputs</b>, as before, if
<b  >Debug</b> is not set, no debugging output is
produced. The <b  >info level</b> command returns the
current nesting level of the procedure call stack, the
<b  >dputs</b> procedure. Subtracting one from
<b  >$current</b> is the stack level of
<b  >dputs</b>'s caller. The <b  >info level
$current</b> command returns a list of information about the
procedure stack at level <b  >$current</b>, whose first
element is the name of the procedure. If <b  >dputs</b>
is called at the global scope, the call to <b  >info
level</b> will fail (<b  >current</b> will be -1),
thus the <b  >catch</b> around <b  >info
level</b>, which will leave <b  >$caller</b> with
the pre-initialized value of <b  >toplevel</b>.</p><p>Now that we have the name of the procedure that
<b  >dputs</b> was called from, it is a simple matter for
<b  >string match</b> to compare the procedure name in
<b  >$caller</b> with the pattern in
<b  >Debug</b>, and only emit debugging output for the
desired procedures. The pattern in <b  >Debug</b> can be
changed interactively at the command prompt, or automatically under
program control.</p><p>Although this version of <b  >dputs</b> is better,
it requires the programmer know <span   class="emphasis"><em>in advance</em></span>
what information to pass as arguments to <b  >dputs</b>
in order for the debug output to help locate the bug. Typically,
half the battle of debugging is determining what information needs
to be printed to find the bug, and what <b  >dputs</b>
prints is probably not right.</p><p>We can easily overcome this limitation by remembering that
Tcl is an interpreted language. Instead of simply printing canned
values that are passed as arguments to <b  >dputs</b>, we
can stop the program at any <b  >dputs</b> call and allow
the programmer to enter arbitrary Tcl commands to elicit
information about the current execution state of the
program.</p><p>The next procedure, <b  >breakpoint</b>, may be
inserted anywhere in a Tcl program to cause it to stop and allow
interactive execution of commands. For example, the Tcl moral
equivalent of the C <b  >assert</b> command is
implemented by calling <b  >breakpoint</b> any time an
invalid condition is detected. Alternately,
<b  >breakpoint</b> can be inserted into
<b  >dputs</b> so breakpoints can be turned on or off
selectively using the <b  >Debug</b> variable.</p><p>The <b  >breakpoint</b> procedure implements four
build-in commands: <b  >+</b>, <b  >-</b>,
<b  >?</b> and <b  >C</b>. The
<b  >+</b> and <b  >-</b> commands allow the
user to move up and down the call stack. The <b  >?</b>
commands prints out useful information about the current stack
frame, and <b  >C</b> returns from
<b  >breakpoint</b>, resuming execution of the program.
Any other command is passed to <b  >uplevel</b> to be
evaluated at the appropriate stack level.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
proc breakpoint {} {
  set max [expr [info level] - 2]
  set current $max
  show $current
  while {1} {
    puts -nonewline stderr "#$current: "
    gets stdin line
    while {![info complete $line]} {
      puts -nonewline stderr "? "
      append line \n[gets stdin]
    }
    switch -- $line {
      + {if {$current &lt; $max} {show [incr current]}}
      - {if {$current &gt; 0} {show [incr current -1]}}
      C {puts stderr "Resuming execution";return}
      ? {show $current}
      default {
        catch { uplevel #$current $line } result
        puts stderr $result
      }
    }
  }
}
</pre><p>The procedure <b  >breakpoint</b> demonstrates the
use of the Tcl commands <b  >info level</b> and
<b  >uplevel</b> to examine the state of a running Tcl
program, and the <b  >info complete</b> command to read
and evaluate Tcl commands entered interactively.</p><p>First, <b  >info level</b> computes the depth of
the procedure call stack (in <b  >$max</b>). We need to
subtract two from <b  >info level</b>, one for the
<b  >breakpoint</b> procedure, and one for
<b  >dputs</b>. We then loop (<b  >while
{1}</b>) getting Tcl commands and running them. The variable
<b  >$current</b> contains the current stack level, which
we'll print as part of the prompt to the user.</p><p>Getting a Tcl command from the console is a little tricky, as
a single command might span multiple input lines. We'll use
<b  >info complete</b>, and <b  >append</b>
commands in the inner <b  >while</b> loop to gather up
enough lines of input to form a complete Tcl command. Once we have
the entire command, the <b  >switch</b> statement selects
either one of the built-in commands, or it calls
<b  >uplevel</b> to run the command at the current stack
level, which may have been modified previously by
<b  >+</b> or <b  >-</b> commands. The
<b  >catch</b> around <b  >uplevel</b> insures
that an errant command typed by the user doesn't terminate the
program with an error. We then print the result of the command (or
the error message if it failed), and loop back to get the next
command from the user.</p><p>The built-in commands <b  >+</b> and
<b  >-</b> are used to change the stack level that the
commands we enter will be evaluated in. They simply change the
value of <b  >$current</b>. The <b  >?</b>
command calls <b  >show</b>, and <b  >C</b>
returns, resuming execution of the program. The procedure
<b  >show</b>, which we'll write next, displays useful
information about the current stack level.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
proc show {current} {
  if {$current &gt; 0} {
    set info [info level $current]
    set proc [lindex $info 0]
    puts stderr "$current: Procedure $proc \
                {[info args $proc]}"
    set index 0
    foreach arg [info args $proc] {
      puts stderr \
           "\t$arg = [lindex $info [incr index]]"
    }
  } else {
    puts stderr "Top level"
  }
}
</pre><p>The procedure <b  >show</b> is a shortcut for
printing application-specific information while debugging, since
the user could type in the Tcl commands to achieve the same result.
This version of <b  >show</b>, which gets passed the
stack level <b  >$current</b> as an argument, prints the
procedure name, its arguments, and their values at the time the
procedure was called. In <b  >dputs</b> we used the first
element of <b  >info level $current</b> as the name of
the procedure in stack frame <b  >$current</b>. The
remaining elements contain the values of the arguments passed to
the procedure. The call to <b  >info args</b> returns the
names of the arguments, which we pair with their values in
<b  >info level $current</b>, using the variable
<b  >index</b> to step though the list of argument
values. Here is some sample output from <b  >show</b>,
taken from a debugging session of <b  >HMtag_img</b>,
part of a Tcl HTML library package.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
4: Procedure HMtag_img {win param text}
        win = .clone1.text
        param = src=green_ball.gif
        text = text
#4: <span   class="bold"><b>info vars</b></span>
var text param win
#4: <span   class="bold"><b>set var(font)</b></span>
font:courier:14:medium:r
#4: <span   class="bold"><b>-</b></span>
3: Procedure HMrender {win tag not param text}
        win = .clone1.text
        tag = img
        not =
        param = src=green_ball.gif
        text =  This is a good point
#3: <span   class="bold"><b>C</b></span>
Resuming Execution
</pre><p>In conclusion, we started with a simple
<b  >puts</b> for program debugging, and in less than 50
lines of Tcl code, created a powerful debugging environment that
can be easily tailored to meet the debugging needs of most Tcl
applications.</p></div></div>
