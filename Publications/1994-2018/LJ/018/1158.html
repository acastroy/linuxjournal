    groff is the GNU version of the popular nroff/troff
    text-formatting tools provided on most Unix systems. Its
    most common use is writing manual pages&mdash;online
    documentation for commands, programming interfaqces, and so
    forth. In this article, we show you the ropes of writing
    your own man pages with groff.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x222f580.0x23274a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Two of the original text processing
systems found on Unix systems are troff and nroff, developed at
Bell Labs for the original implementation of Unix (in fact, the
development of Unix itself was spurred, in part, to support such a
text-processing system). The first version of this text processor
was called <span   class="bold"><b>roff</b></span> (for &ldquo;runoff&rdquo;);
later came troff, which generated output for a particular
typesetter in use at the time. nroff was a later version that
became the standard text processor on Unix systems everywhere.
groff is GNU's implementation of nroff and troff that is used on
Linux systems. It includes several extended features and drivers
for a number of printing devices.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>groff</b></span> is capable of
producing documents, articles, and books, much in the same vein as
other text-formatting systems, such as TeX. However, groff (as well
as the original nroff) has one intrinsic feature that is absent
from TeX and variants: the ability to produce plain-ASCII output.
While other systems are great for producing documents to be
printed, groff is able to produce plain ASCII to be viewed online
(or printed directly as plain text on even the simplest of
printers). If you're going to be producing documentation to be
viewed online, as well as in printed form, groff may be the way to
go (although there are alternatives, such as Texinfo, Lametex, and
other tools).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>groff</b></span> also has the benefit
of being much smaller than TeX; it requires fewer support files and
executables than even a minimal TeX distribution.</p><p>One special application of groff is to format Unix man pages.
If you're a Unix programmer, you'll eventually need to write and
produce man pages of some kind. In this article, we'll introduce
the use of groff through the writing of a short man page.</p><p>As with TeX, groff uses a particular text-formatting language
to describe how to process the text. This language is slightly more
cryptic than systems such as TeX, but also less verbose. In
addition, groff provides several macro packages that are used on
top of the basic formatter; these macro packages are tailored to a
particular type of document. For example, the
<span   class="bold"><b>mgs</b></span> macros are an ideal choice for
writing articles and papers, while the
<span   class="bold"><b>man</b></span> macros are used for man
pages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x222f580.0x23278c8"></a>Writing a man Page</h2></div></div><p>Writing man pages with groff is actually quite simple. For
your man page to look like others, you need to follow several
conventions in the source, which are presented below. In this
example, we'll write a man page for a mythical command
<span   class="bold"><b>coffee</b></span> that controls your
networked coffee machine in various ways.</p><p>Using any text editor, enter the source from Listing 1 and
save the result as <b  >coffee.man</b>. Do not enter the
line numbers at the beginning of each line; those are used only for
reference later in the article.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p>Listing 1. Example man Page Source File</p><p>Don't let the amount of obscurity in this source file
frighten you. It helps to know that the character sequences
<b  >\fB</b>, <b  >\fI</b>, and
<b  >\fR</b> are used to change the font to boldface,
italics, and roman type, respectively. <b  >\fP</b> sets
the font to the one previously selected.</p><p>Other groff requests appear on lines beginning with a dot
(<b  >.</b>). On line 1, we see that the
<b  >.TH</b> request is used to set the title of the man
page to <b  >COFFEE</b>, the man section to
<b  >1</b>, and the date of the last man page revision.
(Recall that man section 1 is used for user commands, section 2 is
for system calls, and so forth. The <b  >man man</b>
command details each section number.) On line 2, the
<b  >.SH</b> request is used to start a section, entitled
<b  >NAME</b>. Note that almost all Unix man pages use
the section progression <b  >NAME</b>,
<b  >SYNOPSIS</b>, <b  >DESCRIPTION</b>,
<b  >FILES</b>, <b  >SEE ALSO</b>,
<b  >NOTES</b>, <b  >AUTHOR</b>, and
<b  >BUGS</b>, with extra, optional sections as needed.
This is just a convention used when writing man pages and isn't
enforced by the software at all.</p><p>Line 3 gives the name of the command and a short description,
after a dash (<b  >[mi]</b>). You should use this format
for the <b  >NAME</b> section so that your man page can
be added to the <span   class="bold"><b>whatis</b></span> database
used by the <b  >man -k</b> and
<b  >apropos</b> commands.</p><p>On lines 4&mdash;6 we give the synopsis of the command syntax for
coffee. Note that italic type
<b  >\fI</b>...<b  >\fP</b> is used to denote
parameters on the command line, and that optional arguments are
enclosed in square brackets.</p><p>Lines 7&mdash;12 give a brief description of the command. Boldface
type is generally used to denote program and file names. On line
13, a subsection named <b  >Options</b> is started with
the <b  >.SS</b> request. Following this on lines 14&mdash;25
is a list of options, presented using a tagged list. Each item in
the tagged list is marked with the <b  >.TP</b> request;
the line <span   class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> <b  >.TP</b> is the
tag, after which follows the item text itself. For example, the
source on lines 14&mdash;16:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p>will appear as the following in the output:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="bold"><b>-h</b></span>     Brew hot coffee. Cold is the default.
</pre><p>You should document each command-line option for your program

the man page, which describes any files that the command might use

request is used for this as well.</p><p>On lines 30&mdash;31, the <b  >SEE ALSO</b> section is
given, which provides cross-references to other man pages of note.
Notice that the string <b  >&lt;\#34&gt;SEE
ALSO&lt;\#34&gt;</b> following the <b  >.SH</b>
request on line 30 is in quotes; this is because
<b  >.SH</b> uses the first whitespace-delimited argument
as the section title. Therefore any section titles that are more
than one word need to be enclosed in quotes to make up a single
argument. Finally, on lines 32&mdash;34, the <b  >BUGS</b>
section is presented.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x222f580.0x2328cb8"></a>Formatting and Installing the man Page</h2></div></div><p>In order to format this man page and view it on your screen,

BUGS
       May  require  human  intervention  if  coffee  supply   is
       exhausted.
</pre><p>Figure 1. Formatted man Page</p><p>As mentioned before, groff is capable of producing other
types of output. Using the <b  >-Tps</b> option in place
of <b  >-Tascii</b> will produce PostScript output that
you can save to a file, view with GhostView, or print on a
PostScript printer. <b  >-Tdvi</b> will produce
device-independent .dvi output similar to that produced by
TeX.</p><p>If you wish to make the man page available for others to view
on your system, you need to install the groff source in a directory
that is present in other users' <b  >MANPATH</b>. The
location for standard man pages is /usr/man. The source for section
1 man pages should therefore go in /usr/man/man1. Therefore, the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cp coffee.man /usr/man/man1/coffee.1
</pre><p>will install this man page in /usr/man for all to use (note
the use of the <b  >.1</b> file name extension, instead
of <b  >.man</b>). When <b  >man coffee</b> is
subsequently invoked, the man page will be automatically
reformatted, and the viewable text saved in
/usr/man/cat1/coffee.1.Z.
</p><p>If you can't copy man page sources directly to /usr/man (say,
because you're not the system administrator), you can create your
own man page directory tree and add it to your
<b  >MANPATH</b>. The <b  >MANPATH</b>
environment variable is of the same format as
<b  >PATH</b>; for example, to add the directory
/home/mdw/man to <b  >MANPATH</b> just use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ export MANPATH=/home/mdw/man:$MANPATH
</pre><p>There are many other options and formatting commands
available for groff and the man page macros. The best way to find
out about these is to look at the files in /usr/lib/groff; the tmac
directory contains the macro files themselves, which often contain
some documentation on the commands they provide. To use a
particular macro set with groff, just use the
<b  >-m<i><tt>macro</tt></i></b> option. For
example, to use the <b  >mgs</b> macros, use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
groff -Tascii -mgs <span   class="emphasis"><em>files...</em></span>
</pre><p>The man pages for groff describe this option in more detail.
</p><p>Unfortunately, the macro sets provided with groff are not
well-documented. There are section 7 man pages for some of them;
for example, <b  >man 7 groff_mm</b> will tell you about
the <b  >mm</b> macro set. However, this documentation
usually only covers the differences and new features in the groff
implementation, which assumes you have access to the man pages for
the original nroff/troff macro sets (known as DWB&mdash;the
Documentor's Work Bench). The best source of information may be a
book on using nroff/troff which covers these classic macro sets in
detail. For more about writing man pages, you can always look at
the man page sources (in /usr/man) and determine what they do by
comparing the formatted output with the source.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>This article is adapted from</em></span> Running
