    This month Dean shares some of the fortuitous discoveries
    he's made in his journey through the Infomagic Developer's
    kit, including ports and clones of DOS programs and some
    favorite utilities.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdda580.0xed2348"></a></h2></div></div><p>The four-CD Infomagic Developer's Kit,
which, as you know if you've been following my column, has become
my choice for getting Linux, holds a lot of code. In browsing
through the disks, I've looked at spreadsheets, text editors,
games, and all sorts of interesting programs and packages. This
month I'll focus on software that should look very familiar to
those of you visiting from the MS-DOS world.
</p><p>In a previous article I mentioned a WordPerfect demo which
demonstrated that some very powerful and popular packages do make
their way over from DOS. Though I had problems getting the demo to
work, that shouldn't reflect poorly on the commercial product. It
shows that Linux is being seriously considered as a valid
alternative to the DOS/Windows OS mindset. [That demo is the SCO
version. Easier to use will be the native Linux version that is
currently being ported by Caldera and is expected to be released
sometime 4Q95&mdash;ED]</p><p>The usual caveat holds. Many of the programs undergo frequent
revisions. Some are shareware or freeware versions of commercial
programs. Others are just as-is.</p><p>Unlike their DOS counterparts, many of these programs include
the source code. Some have originated in DOS; others I mention
because of their tremendous utility or interest, hence the title of
&ldquo;Serendipity&rdquo; for this month.</p><p>Also, I should mention a change in my computer system since
my previous column. I still have a 486/66, but it's now loaded with
16MB of RAM. I don't use a swap file as much, but when it's needed
I'll mention it; with 16MB and no swap file, X-Windows runs happier
and much faster.</p><p>Diving into the CDs...</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdda580.0xed2608"></a>Utilities</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>mc</b></span>, or Midnight Commander,
which I have written about repeatedly, is a clone of Norton
Commander and an absolute godsend. This program removes many of the
hassles of copying and unarchiving. It also reduces your chances of
making bonehead mistakes by not allowing you to quickly delete
things recursively (something, I have been told by experienced
hackers, particularly gut wrenching). To delete recursively, that
is, to delete a directory and the files and subdirectories under
it, mc requires you to wade through two menus and then type &ldquo;yes&rdquo;
to a prompt for deletion.</p><p>Unlike the DOS or Windows Norton Commander, mc offers some
truly unusual choices such as those options found via the
<b  >f2</b> key; your choices change depending on whether
the cursor is on a directory or a file. If you're on a directory
when you press <b  >f2</b>, you gain the option of
creating a tar file of the contents. If you're on a file, the
option changes to include dumping the contents or displaying the
file with <b  >roff -man</b>. You also have options to
edit a bug report and mail it to root (which didn't work for me,
probably because (1) I am root, (2) I don't have a network and
haven't set up mail, and (3) I don't know any better.) Another
option which I both like and dislike is the information hypertext
browser. I like it because it provides a lot of useful information;
I dislike it because it uses Emacs (or something close to it), and
I still haven't mastered many of the commands. mc also offers a
useful search capability that will look for most anything anywhere.
mc is a must have.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>pkgtool</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>installpkg</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>explodepkg</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>removepkg</b></span>, and
<span   class="bold"><b>makepkg</b></span> are part of the Slackware
setup and are a great set of utilities for file handling. Normally,
to install a .gz file I would use mc but I always hated that if I
wanted to uninstall the files I'd have to list the tar, remember or
write down the files, manually search them out and delete them.
installpkg takes care of that by building a script that records
where the files went to. When it's time to delete, removepkg reads
that script and does the dirty work of deletion. Even better, it
won't delete a file if it's in use by some other program. This is a
great system for novices. pkgtool is sort of a shell, but I prefer
to work directly with the sub-utilities; it temporarily raises my
&ldquo;hacker&rdquo; factor. makepkg does like it sounds&mdash;it makes packages.
explodepkg is very similar to installpkg but it doesn't create or
affect scripts. It and installpkg work on Slackware compatible and
(tar+gzip) packages.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>minicom</b></span> should look quite
familiar to you if you have used the DOS versions of the Procomm,
Telix, or QModem communications programs. The
<b  >alt</b> commands are mostly here but where, for
example, in Telix you'd choose <b  >alt</b>-o for the
options screen, in minicom the sequence is
<b  >alt</b>-a-o. <b  >alt</b>-a precedes most
of your choices. It took me a very short time to get used to this
arrangement. minicom doesn't have as many options as the DOS
counterparts. For example, you only get two terminal
emulations&mdash;VT102 and ANSI&mdash;and four protocols for
sending/receiving files: Zmodem, Ymodem, Xmodem, and kermit, but
the options are enough. This program works well, initiating Zmodem
for downloading without hitch, allowing a variety of configuration
options, and even including my favorite two options: text capturing
(<b  >alt</b>-a-l) and screen scroll
back(<b  >alt</b>-a-b)---but still could use some
improvements, such as adding more options to the somewhat limited
dialing directory. I hope that the authors continue to support and
add to this program; I like it and greatly prefer it to the
X-Windows program <span   class="bold"><b>seyon</b></span>.</p><p>Two small utilities that are neither ports from DOS nor
clones but are still quite useful are
<span   class="bold"><b>dos2unix</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>unix2dos</b></span>. These programs just
convert text files to and from Unix and DOS formats, which appears
consist of removing or adding carriage return characters as needed.
Simple and neat.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdda580.0xed2ef8"></a>Miscellaneous</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>xfractint</b></span>---this is a port
from MS-DOS of what I consider the greatest fractal exploration
program ever written. It's free, fast, and fun. Note the &ldquo;x&rdquo;
starting the name. You'll need X-Windows to run it; it may already
be a menu option if you have Slackware&mdash;look under &ldquo;Applications&rdquo;.
I found the program to be essentially the same as the MS-DOS
version, with minor differences. Pressing <b  >del</b>
does not choose the video mode as it does in DOS. Also, the color
cycling commands (<b  >+</b>, <b  >-</b>)
worked but the other cycling option, <b  >c</b>, would
occasionally freeze the program. Yet these are minor nitpicks&mdash;the
fun is playing with the variety of fractal types and the parameters
that go with each. My personal favorites are color cycling &ldquo;plasma&rdquo;
and &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo;, which give me flashbacks to many of the Grateful
Dead concerts that I missed. As an additional fractal exploration
tool, you can develop your own fractal formulas&mdash;but I'll let you
figure out how.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>pov-ray</b></span> stands for
&ldquo;Persistence of Vision&mdash;ray caster&rdquo;, and, like fractint, it's
another great program, with an enthusiastic following. To get
pov-ray started requires untarring a few files, which for me meant
everything but the source code. My usual complaints about unclear
documentation hold for pov-ray; the directions did not quite match
reality. The instructions suggest creating a pov-ray directory but
the files automatically create /pov when untarred. The instructions
suggest you add:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
setenv POVRAYOPT -l$HOME/povray/include
</pre><p>to .cshrc except that, I figure, /povray should read /pov to
match the untarred setup. Also, I couldn't find a .cshrc but I did
find /etc/csh.cshrc, which I copied and modified accordingly. From
what I can figure, csh.cshrc is the configuration file for the C
shell. I also noticed three binaries of pov-ray. Two, povray.s and
povray.v, looked exactly the same, or at least were the same size.
(I did a file compare and they are different). povray.x was
slightly larger. I figured I'd use povray.s.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>pov-ray</b></span> creates Targa
graphics files. You'll need to view them and a viewer is not
included. The manual suggested either
<span   class="bold"><b>xv</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>xli</b></span>. I installed both. xv was on
Slackware's XAP disk (note that this program requires libgr, also
on the XAP disk, also be installed) and I finally found xli on the
Sunsite archive CD-ROM buried in something like
/X11/apps/graphics/viewers.</p><p>Not realizing that to activate changes to login scripts all
I'd have to do is logout and login again, I completely shutdown the
system and rebooted.</p><p>Returned to DOS to play a round of Terminal Velocity. After
again having vital parts of my ship blown to pixel dust, I booted
back to Linux to try pov-ray. The viewers sat waiting. csh.cshrc
was now activated. I copied a sample file into /pov/bin and
typed:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
povray.s -w320 -h200 -ichess.pov -otest.tga \
  +ft -a -dG -v
</pre><p>Nothing happened. pov-ray couldn't find the include files
supposedly pointed to by .cshrc. The familiar stomach cramps
started. I didn't want to RTFM, not 250KB worth of text. Instead I
browsed through the various Linux HOW-TO files on the main
InfoMagic CD looking for information on shells scripts and login
initialization. For the heck of it I modified /etc/csh.login but
pov-ray again couldn't find the include subdirectory. Of course:
I'm not using the C shell! I use bash. Modifying /etc/profile
yielded a similar lack of success. What is going on? Finally I
tried the obvious: copying the include files into /pov/bin. Yes,
that worked! Sure, it's not as elegant as fiddling with the various
configuration files&mdash;but this solution worked, and worked
easily.</p><p>And yet pov-ray wouldn't work completely. It could find the
include files but it couldn't start the graphics display. Oh yeah,
I had to run it through X-Windows. (I may not have
<span   class="emphasis"><em>had</em></span> to do it in X-Windows, but the command
<b  >-dG</b> tells it to display the picture as it
raycasts. When it does so it expects X-Windows.) For about 10
minutes I saw a picture of a chess set develop line by line. While
waiting for the picture to finish I read the pov-ray info that it
had belched before casting and noted that the binary was compiled
with 386s in mind. Later, in reading the instructions, I found the
suggestion for recompiling for 486s to speed things up. Now to see
the Targa output. I called up xv from my X-Windows applications
menu, loaded the file, and saw a chess set. Beautiful! And xv had
some options&mdash;blur, sharpen, oil paint, spread, and de-speckle, to
name a few&mdash;that induced more flashbacks. But I wanted to try the
other viewer as well. Via a shell I called up xli. I expected a
graphics interface; I got a command line reprimand to specify
options. Typing <b  >xli -help</b> showed that the
program offers a tremendous number of options and can manage darn
near any type of image, including many I had never heard of, as
well as many very familiar in the DOS world. But my lack of
familiarity with many of the terms, combined with the command line
interface, soured me on xli. I did get the chess set image loaded,
but I got no farther, and went back to xv to play some more.</p></div></div>
