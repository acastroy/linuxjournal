    Glimpse, a simple but effective indexing package, can help
    you find particular mail messages in large mail archives and
    keep track of files in large directories.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13fb580.0x14f33a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Since nearly my entire livelihood is
maintained by exchanging electronic mail, my e-mail archives (not
including many messages more than a year old) currently use nearly
100MB of my precious hard drive space&mdash;enough that I'm starting to
consider buying a separate hard drive just for my personal files.
In a desperate, somewhat successful, attempt to keep better track
of my e-mail archives, I recently installed
<span   class="bold"><b>exmh</b></span>, a graphical mail program
based on MH (a powerful but complex mail reader) and Tcl/Tk.
</p><p>One optional program that exmh can use to help manage e-mail
is glimpse. From some or all of your mail files, this program
builds an index, which exmh uses to quickly search for any word you
want to look up. I can now search all my e-mail archives for a
long-lost letter in less than a minute.</p><p>But this article isn't about exmh, as useful as it is for MH
users like me. It's about glimpse, an excellent program in its own
right.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13fb580.0x14f35b0"></a>Preparing Glimpse</h2></div></div><p>Unlike the well-known grep program, glimpse does not usually
take an argument telling which files to search. Instead, by
default, glimpse looks in every file which it has indexed. This
means that glimpse requires an index to work.</p><p>Perhaps the simplest way to use glimpse is to index all your
files and search them all when you are looking for something. To do
that, you need to create the index with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
glimpseindex $HOME
</pre><p>or:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
glimpseindex ~
</pre><p>which will index all your files, keeping the index in your home
directory in files whose names start with .glimpse_. These files
will usually take up about 2% to 3% of the total space of the of
the files in your directory.</p><p>If you want to exclude certain files' names from the index,
you can add their complete path names or &ldquo;wildcard&rdquo; expressions
with <b  >*</b> and <b  >?</b> characters to
the file .glimpse_exclude. All of the .glimpse_* files are
documented in the glimpseindex man page.</p><p>Since your files probably change from time to time, you will
need to update the index occasionally. You can either do this
manually, using the same command you used to create the index, or
create a &ldquo;cron job&rdquo; to do it for you (but scheduling jobs with cron
is beyond the scope of this article).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13fb580.0x14f39d0"></a>Using Glimpse</h2></div></div><p>Now that you have created an index, you can search through
it. The easiest way to do this is to simply type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
glimpse <span   class="emphasis"><em>word</em></span>
</pre><p>Glimpse searches through the default index (the one in your
home directory) and returns output similar to grep's with the file
name prepended to each matching line.
</p><p>Perhaps your search doesn't turn up the file you are looking
for; the word might be misspelled in the file. If you want to allow
a one-letter spelling mistake, you can instead use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
glimpse -1 <span   class="emphasis"><em>word</em></span>
</pre><p>Perhaps your search turns up far too many matches. You can
limit the matches to only files with names matching a certain
pattern with the <b  >-F</b> flag. To search only in
files ending in <b  >.c</b>, use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
glimpse -F '.c$' <span   class="emphasis"><em>word</em></span>
</pre><p>The argument following <b  >-F</b> is a full
regular expression, like the search patterns used by grep.
</p><p>You don't have to index only files in your home directory.
The <b  >-H</b> option specifies a different directory
tree to index. The index files are stored in the specified
directory. If you want to index the /usr/doc directory provided
with many Linux distributions, log in as root (or another user that
can write in the /usr/doc directory) and run:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
glimpseindex -H /usr/doc
</pre><p>and then any user able to read the /usr/doc/.glimpse_index
file will be able to search those documents with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
glimpse -H /usr/doc <span   class="emphasis"><em>word</em></span>
</pre><p>If your searches aren't fast enough, you can trade disk space
for time by running glimpseindex with the <b  >-o</b>
flag, to indicate an index that takes up 7% to 8% of the space of
the files being indexed and increases search speed somewhat, or the
<b  >-b</b> flag to indicate an index that takes up 20%
to 30% extra space and increases search speed more.</p><p>If you search all the time, you can speed up your searches by
running the glimpseserver program in the background. That is
covered in the glimpseserver man page.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13fb580.0x14f42c0"></a>What Else?</h2></div></div><p>Glimpse can do more than I can cover here, so if you don't
see what you are looking for, try it&mdash;or at least read the
documentation&mdash;before giving up. In particular, glimpse supports
the options used by <span   class="bold"><b>agrep</b></span>
(approximate grep), a popular search program written by the authors
of glimpse several years ago. agrep and its man page are included
in the glimpse distribution. Its options include boolean searches
of different kinds.</p><p>Glimpse is also the search engine used in the Harvest system,
which &ldquo;is an integrated set of tools to gather, extract, organize,
search, cache, and replicate relevant information across the
Internet&rdquo;, according to the Harvest Web site at
