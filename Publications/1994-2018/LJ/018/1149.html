    New Linux users unfamiliar with this standard Unix tool may
    not realize how useful it is. In this tutorial for the
    novice user, Eric demonstrates grep techniques.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2010580.0x21083a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>When I first started working in systems
integration, I was primarily a PC support person. I spent a lot of
time installing and supporting Windows applications in various PC
LAN configurations, running various versions (and vendors) of
TCP/IP transports. Since then, I have successfully ditched DOS and
moved on. Now, after working on various versions of Unix for a few
years, I porting some of our networking and data manipulation
libraries to other platforms and environments, such as the AS/400
minicomputer and the Macintosh. This ongoing experience has given
me a chance to appreciate just how powerful the tools we take for
granted with Linux really are.
</p><p>Searching for a word (or any other value) in a group of files
is a very common task. Whether it's searching for a function in a
group of source code modules, trying to find a parameter in a set
of configuration files, or simply looking for a misplaced e-mail
message, text searching and matching operations are common in all
environments.</p><p>Unfortunately, this common task doesn't have an easy solution
on all platforms. On most, the best solution available is to use
the search function in an editor. But when it comes to Linux (and
other Unix descendants), you have many solutions. One of them is
<span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span>.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span> is an acronym for
&ldquo;global regular expression print,&rdquo; a reference to the command in
the old <span   class="bold"><b>ed</b></span> line editor that prints
all of the lines in a file containing a specified sequence of
characters. grep does exactly that: it prints out lines in a file
that contain a match for a <span   class="emphasis"><em>regular expression</em></span>.
We'll gradually delve into what a regular expression is as we go
on.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2010580.0x2108710"></a>Starting Out</h2></div></div><p>First, let's look at a quick example. We will search for a
word in the Configure script provided with Linux for setting up the
Linux kernel source, which is usually installed in the
/usr/src/linux directory. Change to that directory and type (the
<b  >$</b> character is the prompt, don't type
it):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep glob Configure
</pre><p>You should see:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Disable filename <span   class="bold"><b>glob</b></span>bing once and for all.
</pre><p><b  >glob</b> is in
<span   class="bold"><b>bold</b></span> to illustrate what grep
matched. grep does not actually print matches in bold.</p><p>grep looked for the sequence of characters
<b  >glob</b> and printed the line of the Configure file
with that sequence. It did not look for the
<span   class="bold"><b>word</b></span> <b  >glob</b>. It
looked for <b  >g</b> followed by <b  >l</b>
followed by <b  >o</b> followed by <b  >b</b>.
This points out one important aspect of regular expressions: they
match sequences of characters, not words.</p><p>Before we dig any deeper into the specifics of pattern
matching, let's look at grep's &ldquo;user interface&rdquo; with a few
examples. Try the following two commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep glob &lt; Configure
$ cat Configure | grep glob
</pre><p>both of these two commands should print</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Disable filename <span   class="bold"><b>glob</b></span>bing once and for all.
</pre><p>which probably looks familiar.</p><p>In all of these commands, we have specified the regular
expression as the first argument to grep. With the exception of any
command line switches, grep always expects the regular expression
as the first argument.</p><p>However, we presented grep with three different situations
and received the same response. In the first exercise, we provided
grep with the name of a file, and it opened that file and searched
it. grep can also take a list of filenames to search.</p><p>In the other two exercises we illustrated a feature that grep
shares with many other utilities. If no files are specified on the
command line, grep reads <span   class="emphasis"><em>standard input</em></span>. To
further illustrate standard input let's try one more
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep foo
</pre><p>When you run that, grep appears to &ldquo;hang&rdquo; waiting for
something. It is. It's waiting for input. Type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tttt
</pre><p>and press <b  >return</b>. Nothing happens. Now type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
foobar
</pre><p>and press enter. This time, grep sees the string
<b  >foo</b> in <b  >foobar</b> and echos the
line <b  >foobar</b> back at you, which is why
<b  >foobar</b> appears twice. Now type
<b  >ctrl</b>-d, the &ldquo;end-of-file&rdquo; character, to tell
grep that it has reached the end of the file, whereupon it exits.</p><p>You just gave grep an input file that consisted of
<b  >tttt</b>, a newline character,
<b  >foobar</b>, a newline character, and the end-of-file
character.</p><p>Piping input into grep from standard input also has another
frequent use: filtering the output of other commands. Sometimes
cutting out the unnecessary lines with grep is more convenient than
reading output page by page with
<span   class="bold"><b>more</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>less</b></span>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ps ax | grep cron
</pre><p>efficiently gives you the process information for crond.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2010580.0x21097e8"></a>Special Characters</h2></div></div><p>Many Unix utilities use regular expressions to specify
patterns. Before we go into actual examples of regular expressions,
let's define a few terms and explain a few conventions that I will
use in the exercises.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Character</b></span> any
printable symbol, such as a letter, number, or punctuation
mark.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>String</b></span> a sequence
of characters, such as <b  >cat</b> or
<b  >segment</b> (sometimes referred to as a
<span   class="bold"><b>literal</b></span>).</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Expression</b></span> also a
sequence of characters. The difference between a string and an
expression is that while strings are to be taken literally,
expressions must be evaluated before their actual value can be
determined. (The manual page for GNU grep compares regular
expressions to mathematical expressions.) An expression usually can
stand for more than one thing, for example the regular expression
<b  >th[ae]n</b> can stand for <b  >then</b> or
<b  >than</b>. Also, the shell has its own type of
expression, called <span   class="emphasis"><em>globbing</em></span>, which is usually
used to specify file names. For example, <b  >*.c</b>
matches any file ending in the characters
<b  >.c</b>.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Metacharacters</b></span> the
characters whose presence turns a string into an expression.
Metacharacters can be thought of as the operators that determine
how expressions are evaluated. This will become more clear as we
work through the examples below.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2010580.0x2100910"></a>Interference</h2></div></div><p>You have probably entered a shell command like</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls -l *.c
</pre><p>at some time. The shell &ldquo;knows&rdquo; that it is supposed to
replace <b  >*.c</b> with a list of all the files in the
current directory whose names end in the characters
<b  >.c</b>.</p><p>This gets in the way if we want to pass a literal
<b  >*</b> (or <b  >?</b>,
<b  >|</b>, <b  >$</b>, etc.) character to
grep. Enclosing the regular expression in
<b  >`</b>single quotes<b  >'</b> will prevent
the shell from evaluating any of the shell's metacharacters. When
in doubt, enclose your regular expression in single quotes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2010580.0x2100de0"></a>Basic Searches</h2></div></div><p>The most basic regular expression is simply a string.
Therefore a string such as <b  >foo</b> is a regular
expression that has only one match: <b  >foo</b>.</p><p>We'll continue our examples with another file in the same
directory, so make sure you are still in the /usr/src/linux
directory:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep Linus CREDITS
</pre><pre     class="programlisting">
Linus
N: Linus Torvalds
E: Linus.Torvalds@Helsinki.FI
D: Personal information about Linus
</pre><p>This quite naturally gives the four lines that have Linus
Torvalds' name in them.
</p><p>As I said earlier, the Unix shells have different
metacharacters, and use different kinds of expressions. The
metacharacters <b  >.</b> and <b  >*</b> cause
the most confusion for people learning regular expression syntax
after they have been using shells (and DOS, for that
matter).</p><p>In regular expressions, the character <b  >.</b>
acts very much like the <b  >?</b> at the shell prompt:
it matches any single character. The <b  >*</b>, by
contrast, has quite a different meaning: it matches
<span   class="emphasis"><em>zero</em></span> or more instances of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>previous</em></span> character.</p><p>If we type</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep tha. CREDITS
</pre><p>we get this (partial listing only):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
S: Nor<span   class="bold"><b>tha</b></span>mpton
E: Hein@Informatik.TU-Claus<span   class="bold"><b>tha</b></span>l.de
</pre><p>As you can see, grep printed every instance of
<b  >tha</b> followed by any character. Now try</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep 'tha*' CREDITS
S: Nor<span   class="bold"><b>tha</b></span>mpton
D: Au<span   class="bold"><b>th</b></span>or of serial driver
D: Au<span   class="bold"><b>th</b></span>or of the new e2fsck
D: Au<span   class="bold"><b>th</b></span>or of loopback device driver
</pre><p>We received a much larger response with &ldquo;<b  >*</b>&rdquo;.
Since &ldquo;<b  >*</b>&rdquo; matches <span   class="emphasis"><em>zero</em></span> or
more instances of the previous character (in this case the letter
&ldquo;a&rdquo;), we greatly increase our possibility of a match because we
made <b  >th</b> a legal match!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2010580.0x2101a40"></a>Character Classes</h2></div></div><p>One of the most powerful constructs available in regular
expression syntax is the <span   class="emphasis"><em>character class</em></span>. A
character class specifies a range or set of characters to be
matched. The characters in a class are delineated by the
<b  >[</b> and <b  >]</b> symbols. The class
<b  >[a-z]</b> matches the lowercase letters
<b  >a</b> through <b  >z</b>, the class
<b  >[a-zA-Z]</b> matches all letters, uppercase or
lowercase, and <b  >[Lh]</b> would match upper case
<b  >L</b> or lower case <b  >h</b>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep 'sm[ai]' CREDITS
E: c<span   class="bold"><b>smi</b></span>th@convex.com
D: Author of several <span   class="bold"><b>sma</b></span>ll utilities

   <b  >smi</b>. The command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep '[a-z]' CREDITS
</pre><p>gives us most of the file. If you look at the file closely, you'll
see that a few lines have no lowercase letters; these are the only
lines that grep does not print.</p><p>Now since we can match a set of characters, why not exclude
them instead? The circumflex, <b  >^</b>, when included
as the <span   class="emphasis"><em>first</em></span> member of a character class,
matches any character <span   class="emphasis"><em>except</em></span> the characters
specified in the class.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep Sm CREDITS
</pre><p>gives us three lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
D: <span   class="bold"><b>Sm</b></span>all patches for kernel, libc
D: <span   class="bold"><b>Sm</b></span>ail binary packages for Slackware and Debian

D: <span   class="bold"><b>Sm</b></span>all patches for kernel, libc
D: <span   class="bold"><b>Sm</b></span>ail binary packages for Slackware and Debian
</pre><p>because we excluded <b  >i</b> as a possible letter to
follow <b  >Sm</b>.</p><p>To search for a class of characters including a literal
<b  >^</b> character, don't place it first in the class.
To search for a class including a literal <b  >-</b>,
place it the very last character of the class. To search for a
class including the literal character <b  >]</b>, place
it the first character of the class.</p><p>Often it is convenient to base searches on the position of
the characters on a line. The <b  >^</b> character
matches the beginning of a line (outside of a character class, of
course) and the <b  >$</b> matches the end. (Users of vi
may recognize these metacharacters as commands.) Earlier, searching
for <b  >Linus</b> gave us four lines. Let's change that
to:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
grep 'Linus$' CREDITS
</pre><p>which gives us</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Linus
D: Personal information about Linus
</pre><p>two lines, since we specified that <b  >Linus</b> must be
   the last five characters of the line. Similarly,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
grep - CREDITS
</pre><p>produces 99 lines, while</p><pre     class="programlisting">
grep '^-' CREDITS
</pre><p>produces only one line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
----------
</pre><p>In some circumstances you may need to match a metacharacter.
Inside a character class set all characters are taken as literals
(except <b  >^</b>, <b  >-</b>, and
<b  >]</b>, as shown above). However, outside of classes
we need a way to turn a metacharacter into a literal character to
match.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2010580.0x2417430"></a>Matching Metacharacters</h2></div></div><p>For this purpose the special metacharacter
<b  >\</b> is used to <span   class="emphasis"><em>escape</em></span>
metacharacters. Escaped metacharacters are interpreted literally,
not as a component of an expression. Therefore
<b  >\[</b> would match any sequence with a
<b  >[</b> in it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep '[' CREDITS
</pre><p>produces an error message:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

syntax, grep provides us with some very powerful capabilities. Its
command line options add even more power.</p><p>Sometimes you are looking for a string, but don't know
whether it is upper, lower, or mixed case. For this situation grep
offers the <b  >-i</b> switch. With this option, case is
completely ignored:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p>The <b  >-v</b> option causes grep to print all
lines that do <span   class="bold"><b>not</b></span> contain the
specified regular expression:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep -v '^#" /etc/syslog.conf | grep -v '^$'
</pre><p>prints all the lines from /etc/syslog.com that are neither
commented (starting with <b  >#</b>) nor empty
(<b  >^$</b>). This prints six lines on my system,
although my syslog.conf file really has 21 lines.
</p><p>If you need to know how many lines match, pass grep the
<b  >-c</b> option. This will output the number of
matching lines (not the number of matches; two matches in one line
count as one) without printing the lines that match:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep -c Linux CREDITS
33
</pre><p>If you are searching for filenames that contain a given
string, instead of the actual lines that contain it, use grep's
<b  >-l</b> switch:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep -l Linux *
CREDITS
README
README.modules
</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span> also notifies us, for
each subdirectory, that it can't search through a directory. This
is normal and will happen whenever you use a wildcard that happens
to include directory names as well as file names.</p><p>The opposite of <b  >-l</b> is
<b  >-L</b>. This option will cause grep to return the
names of files that <span   class="emphasis"><em>do not</em></span> contain the
specified pattern.</p><p>If you are searching for a word and want to suppress matches
that are partial words use the <b  >-w</b> option.
Without the <b  >-w</b> option,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep -c a README

with two very valuable advantages. The first (and most immediate)
of these is a time-saving way to process files and output from
