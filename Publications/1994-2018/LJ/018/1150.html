must admit that I was skeptical. Although the young man in front of
me seemed amicable enough, it was hard to imagine that he headed up
an effort to create a freeware Unix-like operating system. However,
Kurt Reisler was enthusiastic about him, and after ten years of
association with Kurt as the chairman of the Unix Special Interest
Group (UNISIG) of the Digital Equipment Corporation User's Society
(DECUS), instinct told me to go along with his ideas. That is why I
asked my management to fund Linus Torvalds' first trip to DECUS in
New Orleans (spring, 1994), and to fund some equipment at the show
to demonstrate Linux.
</p><p>I had my doubts about this funding as Kurt struggled to get
Linux installed on that first PC, but after some able assistance
from Linus, he did get it working. I had my first look at the
operating system running and in less than ten minutes I had
convinced myself that &ldquo;this was Unix enough for me.&rdquo; Instinct told
me, &ldquo;this is good.&rdquo;</p><p>Later that week Linus joined a few of us for a ride on the
Nachez, a steam boat that plies the Mississippi River. As we rode
up and down the river I started thinking about what Linux might
mean for the educational community, and what it might mean for
Digital.</p><p>Twenty-five years ago I was a student at a university in
Philadelphia. Although we had a large computer system, it was kept
behind glass doors, and batch jobs on computer cards were passed
through a narrow opening in the wall, with printouts coming back
over a 24-hour period.</p><p>Trying to learn operating systems design on such a system
meant using an emulator, and the process of using that emulator
through punched cards was really painful, about like having a root
canal without anesthetic.</p><p>Fortunately at the same school was a little minicomputer lab,
and in that lab were three small PDP-8 machines from Digital. It
was on these machines, with the aid of some free architecture books
given to me by the Digital salesman, and some freeware software
that came from DECUS, that I really started to learn about how
computer systems worked. I always remembered that lab, those
machines, and that Digital salesman.</p><p>Years later, after working on large IBM mainframes, heading
the department at a small two-year technical college (using
Digital's equipment once again), and learning Unix at Bell
Laboratories (on Digital's VAX machines) I had an offer to work
with Digital's Unix group in Nashua, New Hampshire. I took that
offer, in hopes of being able to contribute to the same environment
that had helped me learn computers in those early years.</p><p>Working in the Unix group, I often heard about universities,
colleges, and even high schools that wanted to use Unix to teach
computer science. Despite the origins of Unix as a research tool,
and the vast contributions to Unix made by the University of
California Berkeley and other schools, the licensing terms of our
product did not make it easy to share source code.</p><p>As a commercial Unix system, we license technology from a
variety of companies and integrate that technology into our
sources. Some licensing agreements required us to keep the source
code private unless the requesting customer had a license agreement
directly with the supplier of the technology. Over time, this meant
that to get all of the sources to our Unix products, fifteen
separate licenses were necessary, at a cost of thousands of
dollars, and even then the sources were restricted to a &ldquo;need to
know&rdquo; basis and were not for consumption by curious
students.</p><p>A second issue was cost. Schools had been moving towards PCs
and Macintosh computers over the years, mostly because of the low
cost of the hardware, operating system, and applications. While
these machines were fine to do reports on, or to do other types of
&ldquo;application&rdquo; work, the lack of sources to the operating system,
networking, and compilers made them less useful for teaching
operating system design. Workstations, on the other hand, tended to
use more expensive components, larger amounts of main memory, and
were generally outside the price-band of most schools trying to
teach computer science to large numbers of students.</p><p>As I stood on the deck of the Nachez, several thoughts ran
through my mind. I knew that Digital was developing some low-cost
Alpha single-board computers which used industry standard buses
(PCI and ISA). I also knew that the Alpha (with its 64-bit
architecture) had unique capabilities for doing computer science
research into large address-space utilization. The Alpha processor
was a true RISC system, which would test the portability of the
Linux kernel, and the availability of Linux on Alpha would help
develop new concepts for better using the Alpha's blazing speed,
currently 1 billion instructions per second (BIPS), even in our
commercial Unix product. So I asked Linus if he had ever considered
doing a port to the Alpha. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but the Helsinki office
of Digital has been having problems locating a system for me, so I
may have to do the PowerPC instead.&rdquo;</p><p>My fellow employees tell me that I howled like a wounded
hound at that point, and (I find this hard to believe) dropped my
Hurricane (a fine New Orleans drink). It was then that I knew I had
to help get Linux on Alpha.</p><p>The next day I flew back to New Hampshire, and that morning I
was on the phone to Bill Jackson, a marketing manager in our
Personal Worksystems Group. I explained the situation, and why I
felt this was a good thing for Digital. Bill and I had known each
other for a long time, and just as I had faith in Kurt Reisler,
Bill had faith in me. &ldquo;maddog,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I only have a Jensen (a
code name for an early Alpha workstation, which had an EISA bus),
but it has 96MB of main memory, Ethernet, and 2.5GB of SCSI disk
space.&rdquo; &ldquo;Throw in a CD-ROM drive and you have a deal,&rdquo; I said
(being a tough negotiator), &ldquo;my cost center will pay the
shipping.&rdquo;</p><p>I still had to really formalize the agreement with Linus.
Fortunately he was attending the summer USENIX in Boston, so I took
the paperwork loaning him the computer system down to Boston. &ldquo;How
long is the loan?&rdquo; asked Linus (while munching on a hot dog). &ldquo;As
long as you need it,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;or until we can get you an even
faster system.&rdquo;</p><p>The next week the system was shipped to Helsinki, via the
Digital office there.</p><p>About the same time I heard about a group of engineers inside
of Digital who were also working to port Linux to Alpha. I got them
a system identical to the one I had obtained for Linus.</p><p>Since Digital was now somewhat in the &ldquo;Linux market&rdquo;, I
thought it was time to formally write up the value of Linux to
Digital, and to give some real thought as to why Digital should
support a porting effort. I also had to think of how Linux systems
on Alpha might affect the sales of Digital's own product, DEC OSF/1
(since renamed Digital Unix to reflect having been branded as
&ldquo;Unix&rdquo; by X/Open, Inc.).</p><p>I quickly concluded that there were markets for Linux on
Alpha, and these markets have some of (but not all) the same
characteristics:</p><p>They need the source code for:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>changing</p></li><li><p>observation</p></li><li><p>exchange</p></li><li><p>They have more time and manpower than money</p></li><li><p>They do not need huge numbers of commercial
applications (yet)</p></li></ul></div><p>I also found a market that would probably
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> want Linux (yet), and these are some of
their characteristics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>They resemble my Mom &amp; Pop (computer
illiterate, and proud of it)</p></li><li><p>They want some entity to guarantee the operating
system</p></li><li><p>They are mostly dependent on commercial
applications</p></li></ul></div><p>The markets here are not all black and white. For example,
one market that is typically thought of as a &ldquo;Linux market&rdquo; is the
&ldquo;computer hobbyist&rdquo; market. To a lot of commercial computer
vendors, this market uses older PCs, cast off from other
applications, to fuel a &ldquo;hobby&rdquo;, much like the Radio Amateurs of
ARRL fame. However, if you really look at this market, you see some
of these people buying very sophisticated gear, trying to reach &ldquo;an
edge&rdquo;. This can be an interesting (but relatively small)
market.</p><p>Another (much larger) market is the computer science
education market. Universities, colleges, and even grade schools
teach students to interact with computers, and many teach computer
science. With Linux as the operating system, and either PCs or
low-cost Alpha processors as the platform, these customers can now
actively teach computer science, with access to source code for
students to modify and try on their individual systems. Research in
computer science (particularly with large address spaces, or with
RISC instruction sets) can easily be facilitated with Linux, and
the copyleft licenses encourage free exchange of the research
results.</p><p>The fallout of this is that larger systems (funded, perhaps,
by research grants) may also be sold. Or the purchaser of 100 Linux
desktop systems might appreciate a server machine to hold the
student's files, do the printing, handle mail, etc. It makes sense
that the server machine be either of the same architecture as the
clients, or at least have data compatibility on the binary level.
Intel machines and Alpha machines are both &ldquo;little endian&rdquo;, and
even if the Intel architecture is only 32 bit, it is relatively
easy to make them data compatible.</p><p>Another market where Linux would shine is turnkey
systems&mdash;places where a large number of systems would be purchased,
mostly for one application, such as point-of-sale terminals, or for
large user-written applications which have to run on a large number
of discrete systems. In this case the savings in operating system
license royalty payments might pay for a system programmer to do
the integration and support of Linux on system boxes. Also, since
there tend to be fewer applications to run on these turnkey
systems, it might be easier to stay with one version of Linux,
versus having to keep upgrading to newer versions.</p><p>Finally, there is another side to the freeware operating
system market, and that is what the commercial software developers
can gleen from what the freeware people develop. By looking at what
features the Linux community puts into their systems, commercial
systems can improve by emulating the design decisions made in
freeware operating systems. Not every design decision will be
followed, but certainly some good ideas have already been seen in
Linux, and should be studied by developers of commercial code. We
no longer have the luxury of re-inventing the wheel.</p><p>I am often asked how Digital Unix (Digital's commercial Unix
product) would fit with Linux on Alpha. I see no conflict. Some
people want such features as certifiable C2 security, &ldquo;cluster&rdquo;
style systems (multiple systems working together as a single
image), SMP scalable to large numbers of processors, soft realtime
support (which I keep asking Linus to put into Linux), large
log-based file systems, etc. These features (and more) are all
things that Digital Unix has today, and which may or may not show
up in Linux in the future, depending on what the Linux developers
find &ldquo;interesting&rdquo;.</p><p>On the other hand, I believe that Digital should continue to
work to make Digital Unix more and more compatible with Linux and
netBSD (which has also been ported to the Alpha processor, and is
available across the network), and provide diskless and dataless
support for both Intel and Alpha Linux systems. Already there are
some interesting possibilities, since Linux Alpha can run binaries
statically linked on Digital Unix systems, and I assume that the
same may be true of taking statically linked Linux binaries and
running them on Digital Unix systems. By working on binary
compatibility between the two operating systems, Digital would help
facilitate a large number of applications that would run on both
operating systems.</p><p>Digital's present plans do not include shipping a CD-ROM
created by Digital with Linux &ldquo;Alphabits&rdquo; on it. We feel that the
current companies and groups are doing a fine job, and we will work
with those groups to have the Alphabits put on their distributions.
Likewise, we will continue to put our contributions out on the
Internet for the Linux community to use. Digital's goal is simply
to have the best, easiest, and fastest hardware to host the Linux
operating system, whether it be Intel-based PCs or systems using
the Alpha 64-bit processor.</p></div></div>
