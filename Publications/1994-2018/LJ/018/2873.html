the information below might be of interest. I rarely use my
notebook for working with C code, due to the swap partition slowing
things down. A 500-line code fragment will take 30 seconds to
become an executable on my Fosa 486DX2[hy]66 notebook with 4MB of
RAM; it takes six seconds on my 386DX33 desktop with 8MB.</p><p>Following are results I obtained testing battery life:
stopwatch timed, average of many runs each operating system. The
machine was the notebook mentioned above, which has dual scan
colour. Batteries were fully charged at start in each case. I
included both continuous and periodic runs.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

nearly 50% increase using OS/2 or Linux is puzzling and requires
further investigation.</p><p>R. H. Armstrong,
<a href="mailto:hankarm@compumedia.com">hankarm@compumedia.com</a></p><p>Yes&mdash;and there is a perfectly good reason. Linux and OS/2
use the &ldquo;halt&rdquo; instruction to stop the CPU when they are idle;
DOS and Windows 3.1 do not. This also has an effect on temperature;
CPUs running Linux and OS/2 are much, much cooler than those
running other operating systems. A few months ago, someone
connected a thermocouple to his CPU and ran a bunch of tests and
reported on the results on the newsgroups, his tests showed that
DOS and Windows ran the CPU very hot, and Linux and OS/2 ran the
CPU much cooler.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f9c580.0x20943f8"></a>More Feedback</h2></div></div><p>Although there have been some improvements with regard to the
LLS (Linked List Syndrome), I think there is still room for
improvement (beside never splitting articles at all).</p><p>Personally I find footers and headers like &ldquo;continued on
next/from previous page&rdquo; irritating. What kind of audience is <i  >LJ</i>
aiming at? Brainless Windoze 96 users? I have enough brain
capacities to turn the page without instruction. I can even skip
pages that contains ads without instruction; it is my default
behavior. May I suggest you only use those &ldquo;continued&rdquo; lines when
you skip over parts of other articles?</p><p>Another disadvantage of the LLS is the need to backtrack the
origin of the current article when you want to continue with the
next article. When backtracking is necessary to find the next
article, could you print the page number of the next article at the
end of articles?</p><p>Hans de Vreught,
<a href="mailto:J.P.M.deVreught@cp.tn.tudelft.nl">J.P.M.deVreught@cp.tn.tudelft.nl</a></p><p>We have taken this suggestion and discontinued the
continuation lines when an article jumps over ads. Alert readers
will note that you can always tell when an article ends by looking
for the &ldquo;<i  >LJ</i>&rdquo; symbol.</p><p>Although we'd like to believe that all our readers
read <i  >Linux Journal</i> straight through from cover to cover,
we suspect that it's not true. So we leave it up to our readers to
use the table of contents to find the articles they want to
read.</p><p>There is a thing that I don't understand with the
<i  >LJ</i>. Why do you split so many of the articles
into pieces? In <i  >LJ</i>16, &ldquo;perl&rdquo; was continued
on page 51 and 52. Why not on page 44 and 45? For my feeling, this
is rather confusing and I wouldn't like the books at my library
sorted like this.</p><p>Otherwise I'm glad that there is the
<i  >LJ</i>.</p><p>Micha Jung,
<a href="mailto:jungm@sip.medizin.uni-ulm.de">jungm@sip.medizin.uni-ulm.de</a></p><p>When laying out <i  >Linux Journal</i>, first we
put color items (ads and illustrations) on the color pages, then we
fit everything else around that. We try to avoid jumps whenever
possible, but sometimes, because of ad placement and so forth,
articles have to jump. We try to keep code examples together and we
generally don't have more than one jump per article, not counting
pages with just ads. Every month it's like working out a puzzle to
fit everything. Hopefully, this clears up the reason for
jumps.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f9c580.0x2094b30"></a>Linux <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> Real!</h2></div></div><p>Many projects at work have screamed for a Linux solution.
Whenever I mentioned it, I would get some interesting looks, and
then the subject would change. Most projects would get done by
coercing Novell to work, or worse, use a dedicated PC to do certain

presentation was to have a few <i  >Linux Journal</i>s

really helped to have a professional publication to drive the point

increase, the following e[hy]mail dialog took place between a
reader and <i  >Linux Journal</i> publisher Phil
Hughes. We'd like to hear other readers' thoughts on this
issue.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>
(in c.o.l.announce): We want to continue to make <i  >LJ</i> affordable but
it has to be affordable for us to print as well. We settled on a $3
increase for 1-year subscriptions and a $5 increase on 2-year
subscriptions. If paper prices and postage prices remain fairly
stable, we can live with that and hope that you can too. Oh, if you
happen to own a forest suitable for making into paper and want to
support the Linux community, please contact me.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Charles A. Stickelman</b></span>
(<a href="mailto:stick@richnet.net">stick@richnet.net</a>):
Have you looked into stock made from things other than trees? There
appear to be several alternatives to wood pulp; straw and hemp both
make a great substitute. Hemp does not need the harsh chemicals to
process, and is therefore much less acidic than wood pulp. One
benefit of this reduced acidity is that hemp[hy]based paper is much
more stable than wood[hy]based; it doesn't turn yellow and
deteriorate. This is good for reference materials (like
<i  >LJ</i>) that may need to be around awhile. There
are also other economic/ecologic concerns that hemp solves. This
has nothing to do with the recreational uses/abuses of hemp
by-products.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>:
Yes, we have. We have used hemp/straw copier paper but had a
problem with curl. But hemp[hy]based paper is just not available
for the type of press magazines are printed on, and is even more
expensive than tree[hy]based paper for other types of printing. To
me this is a political issue and I am on the side of getting hemp
recognized as a good alternative, which should substantially reduce
the price. <i  >Linux Journal</i> spends tens of thousands of dollars on
printing each month, which sounds like big money to me, but it
isn't to the paper industry.</p><p>I am more socially conscious than most in this business (or
any business). The problem is that it is hard to tell potential
subscribers that our products cost more than the competition
because we use tree[hy]free, acid[hy]free paper and soy inks. We do
what we can and hopefully the environmentally responsible solution
will become the low[hy]cost solution. For example, we now use
copier paper made from old telephone books that (finally) costs
less than non[hy]recycled. [We have just been notified that this
paper has been discontinued, sadly&mdash;ED]</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Charles</b></span>: I've been a
subscriber of <i  >LJ</i> since issue #1, and I love
it! It's very well done; easy to read and quite educational. For
the record, I'd be willing to pay an extra $5/yr (on top of you
$3/$5 increase) to have <i  >LJ</i> use soy-based ink and hemp/straw based
paper.</p><p>Readers, what do you think? Would you be willing to
pay more to get <i  >Linux Journal</i> and other publications on
an environmentally-friendly, more durable paper stock (if such
paper becomes available)?</p></div></div>
