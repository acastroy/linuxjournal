        Are you used to the simplicity of your old DOS word processor, and afraid of the complexity of LaTeX?
        This article tells you how to write a beautiful letter&mdash;and gets you started using LaTeX.
      </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cbd580.0x1db5190"></a></h2></div></div><p>I admit it. LaTeX was not my first choice
for a text formatter. I was pressured into using LaTeX by my (then)
fianc&eacute;, and the fact that at the end of the semester, all
the IBM PCs and the Macs were being used 24 hours a day, while the
Unix terminals were almost totally free. Also, I had to reboot from
Linux into DOS every time I wanted to use one of my favorite word
processing programs on my fianc&eacute;'s computer, which was no
fun. So, armed with a topology assignment I wanted to type, I
started to learn LaTeX.
</p><p>Even after the first week or so of using LaTeX, it was not my
favorite program. It wasn't a word processor or an editor&mdash;it was
something new to me. I didn't see the italics or the underlining or
my math equations on the screen as I entered or edited my papers.
After a while, though, I got used to the rules, and my papers
looked so beautiful that I fell in love with LaTeX. I am not a
LaTeX or TeX (LaTeX is based on TeX) guru&mdash;it is all I can do to
remember how to start a document. But the freedom and power of
LaTeX make it well worth the initial time investment to learn it,
and if you are doing ordinary everyday writing, LaTeX is not
terribly difficult to use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cbd580.0x1db52f0"></a>It Takes Some Work</h2></div></div><p>There are a few major differences between LaTeX and your
favorite word processor. It is not WYSIWYG (what you see is what
you get) or WYSLRN (what you see looks really neat&mdash;bold is
<span   class="bold"><b>bold</b></span>, italic is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>italic</em></span>, but new lines and page breaks aren't
necessarily where they will be when the document is printed). With
LaTeX, what you see is what LaTeX sees, and you type in the exact
commands that you want LaTeX to use. This means that WYSLRU (what
you see looks really ugly) while you are entering your text. [There
are so-called front ends to LaTeX that are almost WYSIWYG.
<i  >Linux Journal</i> will probably contain articles
on those in later issues, because they can make it much easier for
you to use LaTeX&mdash;ED] However, because what you see is exactly
what LaTeX sees, if something in your document output doesn't look
right, you can perhaps find it and fix it more easily than you
could with a word processor.</p><p>Another difference is that when it comes to formatting
decisions, LaTeX will handle the details if you handle the general
idea. For example, if you want your footnotes labeled with letters
instead of numbers, or the numbering of footnotes to begin at 1 on
every page, or some other labeling scheme, you need only instruct
LaTeX once at the beginning of your document. If you change your
mind, you don't need to change all your footnotes&mdash;just change the
instructions at the beginning, and LaTeX will handle the
rest.</p><p>The last difference is that there is no standard user
interface for LaTeX; you can use whatever text editor you want. I
use Emacs, but any Emacs clone, or vi or another editor which uses
plain text, will work. Because you can use any editor, starting an
article or paper is a little more complex than in a word processor.
You need to tell LaTeX the type of document you are creating,
normally a &ldquo;book&rdquo;, &ldquo;article&rdquo;, &ldquo;report&rdquo;, or &ldquo;letter&rdquo;. Any book on
LaTeX will explain the specific differences between the document
types; their names should give a good idea of what they are
for.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cbd580.0x1db55b0"></a>Writing a Letter</h2></div></div><p>Having told LaTeX which type of document you are doing, it
figures out the page formatting and the special options needed
throughout the document. I will use the &ldquo;letter&rdquo; document style to
demonstrate the basics of typing documents in LaTeX, as well as the
power of LaTeX to make documents easy to format and
beautiful.</p><p>To begin any document, after starting your editor you need to
place a preamble at the start of the file, of the form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
documentstyle[...]{...}
</pre><p>A few things need to be noted about this preamble. First, the
backslash. LaTeX uses the backslash before most commands, so you
should get familiar with its location on your keyboard. The
brackets contain options that change something less drastic than
the document style. For instance, you can change the type size from
10 point to 11 or 12 point, set the entire document in two columns,
or use other more advanced options. The braces hold the name of the
document type: usually article or letter. The braces and their
contents are required.
</p><p>Since we are writing a letter, we will start out with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
documentstyle{letter}
</pre><p>All documents need <b  >\begin{document}</b> at the
beginning (preceded, of course, by the
<b  >documentstyle</b> command and, often, by other more
advanced commands) and <b  >end{document}</b> at the
end.</p><p>Letters are unique among the styles. You may want to write
several letters in the same file, reusing the same return address
and signature. LaTeX allows you to do this by stating the address
and signature before the <b  >\begin{document}</b>
statement. Then, each letter is begun with
<b  >\begin{letter}</b> and ended with
<b  >end{letter}</b>. After all your letters, put
<b  >end{document}</b> to end the document.</p><p>The format of the <b  >address</b> and
<b  >signature</b> commands are similar and something you
will become very familiar with in LaTeX. Type the command, followed
by the argument (for these commands, your address and your name and
title) in braces:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
address{Linux Journal\\P.O. Box 85867\\
Seattle, WA 98145&mdash;1867}
signature{Kim Johnson\\Chief Bottle Washer}
</pre><p>Notice the double backslashes; these are added to force a new
line&mdash;simply pressing <b  >return</b> will not work, as
I explain later.</p><p>Now, begin your first letter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
\begin{document}
\begin{letter}{Aunt Jane\\
St. Mary Mead\\England}
</pre><p>The argument in the second set of braces is the address of
the recipient of the letter. Note the recurring double backslashes
and the tendency to put arguments in braces to set them apart. You
may want to add an <b  >end{letter}</b> at this point and
then type the rest of the letter between the
<b  >\begin</b> and <b  >end</b>&mdash;it saves a
lot of time debugging later.
</p><p>The other options are mostly self-explanatory from the
example letter.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
opening{Dearest Aunt Jane,}
This is a very short letter.
closing{With love,}
cc{Hercule Poirot\\Tuppence}
encl
ps{P.S. This is a postscript.}
end{letter}
end{document}
</pre><p>Your name is added underneath the closing of the letter from
the <b  >signature</b> command that was used before the
<b  >\begin{letter}</b>, as shown in Figure 1.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="1163f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Output from LaTeX

</p></div></div><p>It would be possible to arrange this letter on the page &ldquo;by
hand&rdquo; on most word processors, and even on LaTeX, but the point is
LaTeX does the formatting and you do the writing. The other
document styles do not format quite so aggressively, but they do
allow you to add your title and dedications without having to worry
about getting everything centered and on the correct page.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cbd580.0x1db6370"></a>Outputting Your Document</h2></div></div><p>Now, suppose that you want to see what your letter really
looks like&mdash;you certainly don't want to send it as it appears in
your letter.tex file. So, after saving the file and exiting the
editor (or just popping over to another virtual console), from
within the directory where letter.tex is, type latex
<b  >letter.tex</b>. LaTeX will format your file it in a
way that can be displayed and printed. The formatted file will be
called letter.dvi; DVI stands for &ldquo;device independent&rdquo;, which means
that your file can be displayed or printed using a number of
programs. If you are using X-Windows, type <b  >xdvi
letter.dvi</b> to see what you have written. If you are not
running X-Windows, you may be able to use
<span   class="bold"><b>dvgt</b></span>, which comes with some
distributions and is also available from sunsite.unc.edu in the
/pub/Linux/apps/tex/dvi/ directory. However, its user interface is
not the best possible for a novice, and
<span   class="bold"><b>xdvi</b></span> is certainly easier to
use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cbd580.0x1db65d8"></a>Special Formatting Commands</h2></div></div><p>&ldquo;The text looks great!&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;But I didn't just want to
type plain text in, I wanted to add italics and underlining and
mathematical equations and footnotes and...&rdquo; (If you didn't get
past the command <b  >latex letter.tex</b>, I'll give
some hints for debugging your letter later.) Most of these commands
are easy enough and very similar to the commands used so
far.</p><p>For example, to create a footnote, type
<b  >footnote{This is the text of the footnote.}</b>
wherever you want the footnote to appear. Note that you will have
to be careful with spacing&mdash;put the <b  >footnote</b>
command after any punctuation, but before any trailing space. LaTeX
will make a complete list of the footnotes and number them
correctly. However, if you want to number them yourself, use
<b  >footnote[<i><tt>num</tt></i>]{text}</b>
instead. Remember that brackets contain optional things, so you
don't need to number the footnotes yourself unless automatic
numbering won't do what you want.</p><p>Creating italic and bold text is very similar, except the
bold and italic commands are actually inside the braces instead of
outside. This is so that more than one command can apply to a
region. Here are some examples: I can make some words <b  >{\bf
<i><tt>bold</tt></i>}</b>, <b  >{em
<i><tt>italic</tt></i>}</b>, <b  >{em\bf
<i><tt>bold-italic</tt></i>}</b>,
or <b  >{em <i><tt>have</tt></i> a {\bf
<i><tt>bold</tt></i>} word in a group of <i><tt>italic
words</tt></i>}</b>. (em stands for emphasized text; it,
which stands for italic, works as well.) LaTeX has many other type
styles which work the same as bold and italic; they are documented
in all LaTeX reference books.</p><p>Another method used in LaTeX for text formatting is similar
to the one you used for the letter environment with the
<b  >\begin</b> and <b  >end</b> commands. For
example, here is how to center text:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
\begin{center}
Here is my centered text,\\
here are two\\
more lines of centered text.
end{center}
</pre><p>Again, as in the letter, the double backslashes signal a new
line. The <b  >\begin</b> and <b  >end</b>
commands, along with <b  >{table}</b>,
<b  >{quotation}</b> and many other options, are
documented in the reference manuals.
</p><p>To sum up, when dealing with some text which is to be put in
a separate place on the page, as in <b  >footnote</b> and
<b  >opening</b>, the text goes after the command in
braces. When dealing with a few words in the flow of the main text,
the command (like <b  >em</b> and <b  >\bf</b>)
goes within the brackets along with the text, to set it off from
the text around it. And finally, when dealing with larger blocks of
text within the document which need to be displayed specially, such
as centered text or a table, commands such as
<b  >\begin{center}</b> and
<b  >end{center}</b> are used around the text.</p><p>A note about line breaks and spacing: When LaTeX sees a line
break in your typed-in text, it just assumes that your line got too
long and you went to the next line to keep entering text for the
same paragraph. LaTeX knows better than you do how many words fit
on a line, so one line break just doesn't register with LaTeX. Two
or more line breaks (one or more blank lines), on the other hand,
are interpreted as a &ldquo;new paragraph&rdquo;, so LaTeX will skip a line
and/or indent, whatever is appropriate in your document style, and
will not put that extra new line in the output. If you want to
force LaTeX to break a line without a new paragraph, you must use a
<b  >\\</b>, a double backslash.</p><p>LaTeX also interprets extra spaces and extra empty lines just
as it would one space or one empty line. You probably won't know
exactly how many lines to leave blank; just leave it up to LaTeX.
As in the letter above, LaTeX knows where on the page to put
everything so it looks good, so let it do the work. On the other
hand, if LaTeX does not know how to make things look right, you do
have some control. As above, use <b  >\\</b> (or
equivalently, <b  >linebreak</b>) to specify a line
break, and <b  >pagebreak</b> to begin a new page. If
this doesn't work, see one of the books about it, or else ask your
local &ldquo;TeXnician&rdquo; (TeX-speak for &ldquo;TeX guru&rdquo;).</p><p>Finally, you can add horizontal and vertical space with
<b  >hspace{<i><tt>width</tt></i>}</b> and
<b  >vspace{<i><tt>height</tt></i>}</b>
respectively, where
<b  ><i><tt>width</tt></i></b> and
<b  ><i><tt>height</tt></i></b> refer to the
amount of space you want added. For example,
<b  >hspace{.25in}</b> would make the current line be at
least a quarter inch high; it's the equivalent of an infinitely
thin letter a quarter of an inch high. This may not work at the
beginnings of paragraphs, the end of lines, the end of pages, and
various other spots. Again, see the book if you can't get it to
work the way you want!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cbd580.0x1dae048"></a>But It Didn't Work</h2></div></div><p>Now, back to your letter. Suppose that you typed it all in,
tried to LaTeX it, and it didn't work. This happens to everyone
once in a while. To get back to the prompt after a failed LaTeX
run, type <b  >q</b> or <b  >x</b> or
<b  >ctrl</b>-d (this is one of my favorite features of
TeX&mdash;it's very easy to get out of). A number of common problems
cause errors. First, did you remember to put an
<b  >end{document}</b> at the end of your file? Or are
there any other <b  >\begin</b> statements without a
matching <b  >end</b> statement? A variation of this is
missing or mismatched braces or brackets. Another common problem is
misspelled commands&mdash;if you tell LaTeX to
&ldquo;<b  >senter</b>&rdquo;, it doesn't know what to do. My most
common problem using forward slashes instead of backslashes, so I
routinely do a search-and-replace for forward slashes with
backslashes before printing. Also, I use Emacs in latex-mode, so it
warns me about mismatched braces.</p><p>Finally, LaTeX has some special characters which can't be
used in text as they are, because they have special meanings (which
aren't covered in this article). These characters are:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# $ % &amp; _ { } ~ ^ &lt; &gt;
</pre><p>All of these characters can be produced by LaTeX. The first
seven can be produced by typing <b  >#</b>,
<b  >$</b>, <b  >\\%</b>,
<b  >&amp;</b>, <b  >\\_</b>,
<b  >{</b>, and <b  >}</b>, and the rest can be
produced by typing <b  >verb+~+</b>,
<b  >verb+^+</b>, <b  >verb+&lt;+</b>,
<b  >verb+&gt;+</b>, and <b  >verb++</b>.
</p><p>LaTeX's error messages are usually helpful, giving a line
number near where the error may have occurred and the error type.
They are not always correct, though, so you must do a bit of work,
but since everything is out in the open, it is usually not too
onerous. I recommend frequently saving and LaTeXing your work, so
you catch errors quickly and not after your 3000 word report is
finished (or so you thought). It is also useful to display your
work frequently, and if you are using X-Windows, you can iconify
the <span   class="bold"><b>xdvi</b></span> window when you are
entering text or LaTeXing. <span   class="bold"><b>xdvi</b></span>
will automatically use the newest version of the dvi file, so you
don't need to exit and restart xdvi over and over.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cbd580.0x1dae9e8"></a>Printing</h2></div></div><p>When you are finished editing and are ready to print, you
have a few options. If you have a PostScript printer, the easiest
way to print is probably to use the
<span   class="bold"><b>dvips</b></span> program that should have
come with your TeX/LaTeX installation. If you have the
<span   class="bold"><b>lpr</b></span> program installed, the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dvips <span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span>.dvi | lpr
</pre><p>will print the file. If you want to create a PostScript file,
you can instead type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dvips <span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span>.dvi -o <span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span>.dvi
</pre><p>Other programs are available for other printers. A series of
drivers for the HP LaserJet printers are commonly used; for a
LaserJet 4, you might type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dvilj4 -e- <span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span>.dvi | lpr
</pre><p>to print. The documentation for the LaserJet drivers is
available by typing <b  >man dvilj</b>.
</p><p>If you have any other printer, it is probably supported by
the Ghostscript program. Ghostscript is a PostScript language
interpreter included in most Linux distributions. Setting it up is
beyond the scope of this article, but once it is set up, you can
use <span   class="bold"><b>dvips</b></span> to create a PostScript
file and Ghostscript to print it. For instance, if you have a
printer which is compatible with the HP DeskJet 500, you can
run:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gs -q -sDEVICE=djet500 <span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span>.ps quit
</pre><p>A full list of devices is available by typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gs
devicenames ==
quit
</pre><p>Don't use the &ldquo;<b  >/</b>&rdquo; preceding the device names.</p><p>If your printer supports printing at different resolutions,
you may be able to specify the resolution on the
<b  >gs</b> command line as well. For example, for 240
pixels per inch by 72 pixels per inch, add
<b  >-r240x72</b> to the command line before the
filename. More information about Ghostscript may be obtained by
running <b  >man gs</b>.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Warning:</b></span> Do not just type
<b  >lpr letter.dvi</b> to print your letter; it will
most likely be a mess. Most Linux distributions do not come set up
to automatically print DVI files correctly. It is possible to
install &ldquo;print filters&rdquo; which will make your life easier. One such
program is called <span   class="bold"><b>apsfilter</b></span> and
will be explained in a future article in <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cbd580.0x1daf540"></a>Not Just Letters</h2></div></div><p>You will probably want to do more than write letters. Other
document styles are available, as mentioned earlier. This article
is not the place to go into all of them, but I find &ldquo;article&rdquo; a
good style to use in general. You can make a generic template
document with the preamble and any other options you like
consistently. Then, whenever you want to write a new document, copy
that file to your new document, and you will be ready to go with no
fuss.</p><p>Finally, good luck and have fun! LaTeX is not as difficult as
some people make it seem, and the results after a little work can
be truly dazzling.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Kim Johnson is working towards her PhD in
