market, the new Linux coder is left in a bit of a muddle.</p><p>Information about Linux is spreading&mdash;a good thing in terms
of the open-source model and the community that supports it. The
influx of new Linux authors also tends to decrease the odds of
finding literacy and technical expertise in the same place.
Numerous would-be writers ride the popularity wave of &ldquo;Penguin
Power!&rdquo;, resulting in increasing numbers of Linux &ldquo;bibles&rdquo;, most
of which are just as difficult to follow as the original and not
nearly as imaginative. In either case, the context is most often
distorted, if presented at all. Then again, there are
exceptions.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Professional Linux Programming</em></span> is a huge
credit to both its authors and publishers. It's clearly written,
highly informative and, with the exception of one or two topics,
exhaustive in scope. Its intended audience is intermediate
programmers, but the book is written in sufficiently clear and
plain language as to be quite easily understood by the novice
programmer.</p><p>The book's main &ldquo;theme&rdquo; is a project designed for a DVD
rental store, taking into account both general and user
requirements for a design specification. These specifications are
followed up in subsequent chapters, which discuss various elements.
The vast majority of the chapters in the book go back to this
project and approach the subject matter from that context.
Occasionally, the authors sprinkle in &ldquo;take a break&rdquo; chapters.
These are related to a variety of programming issues in general.
The project, however, is the meat of the book.</p><p>This approach provides not only a context, but a flow of
information from one topic to the next. As a result, the reader
learns a vast quantity of subjects easily because they're all
connected to each other&mdash;an approach more conducive to increasing a
coder's knowledge and skill than the &ldquo;bits and pieces&rdquo; approach
so prevalent among technical works.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a41580.0x2b39d40"></a>Highlights</h2></div></div><p>The majority of programming books, even Linux programming
books, are negligent about providing sane information regarding
application design according to general (and user) specifications.
Given that the first step of writing an application is to define
its use and user-base, design is too often overlooked or, if
mentioned, relegated to the back of the book. This is the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>first</em></span> topic of discussion in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Professional Linux Programming</em></span> and gives the
reader a taste of rationally approaching software
development.</p><p>Having read several Linux programming books, all of which
ignore (by intent or accident) the increasing popularity of CVS
(concurrent version system), I was overjoyed to find an entire
chapter detailing this marvelous tool, both in collaborative and
individual contexts. Common CVS terminology (check-out, commit,
repository, etc.) is delineated, as are commands and the growing
number of CVS resources available on the Internet.</p><p>Databases are, for many programmers, the singularly least
interesting subject and the one that is most easily overlooked.
Matthew and Stones not only give a foundation in database
requirements and functions, but offer an in-depth comparison of
PostgreSQL and MySQL. An interesting addition was a brief contrast
between libpq and ecpg as ways of calling PostgreSQL from C. Later
in the book, as application construction confronts the area of
connectivity, PHP is detailed as well.</p><p>In separate chapters, both debugging and testing are
carefully illustrated, with particular attention paid to the
varieties of software errors and the tools to intercept them prior
to release. Testing tools, including different kinds of tests for
different kinds of requirements, are examined in great length with
particular attention paid to getting the most information from
tests to ensure quality of the application.</p><p>Chapter 12 deals with secure programming (including a
reference to Ken Thompson's &ldquo;trojan&rdquo; that appeared in every
release of the UNIX compiler). This chapter does not, however,
simply leave the reader with a simple alert; it details how
permissions work, some useful cryptography tools and some
environment variables, all of which can assist in the production of
secure code. It ends with a discussion of security
features/impediments that come with some of the more common
programming languages.</p><p>I personally have to give an extra round of applause to
anyone who can take the complexities of Beowulf clusters and turn
them into very comprehensible English (I am currently scrounging a
bunch of 386s with which to construct my own Beowulf cluster&mdash;or
should that be Bayou-Wolf?).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a41580.0x2b3a0b0"></a>Where the Book Succeeds</h2></div></div><p>The success of the book lies in several factors, not the
least of which is readability. This is a book that can be read
cover-to-cover: for a tome of 1150+ pages, such quality is
remarkable. The information is presented clearly and leaves the
reader with a sense of having gone on a rather enlightening journey
(without the flight delays).</p><p>Another factor in its success is the timeliness of its
topics: this is information from which <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>
programmers can benefit given current trends in software
development. It takes into account the increasing need for
networkable applications that don't require extensive training time
for staff to become comfortable with them. The book also presents a
vast array of less commonly discussed tasks such as LDAP
(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), building device drivers
and distributing the application. Such topics may, in time, prove
to be the direction of information technology. For now, they are
useful as foundations on which to build increased repertoires of
environments for which applications are needed.</p><p>There are two primary authors, but another eleven contribute
information based on their individual areas of specialization:
Browne, Clements (Python), Froggatt, Goodger (Python), Griffin,
Licquia, van Loon (multimedia), Ranawake (Beowulf), Rawat
(networks), Sundbakken (QT), Thomas (PHP), Turnbull
(internationalization) and Woodhouse (device drivers). The synergy
behind such a collective effort is apparent, as each contributor's
work, experience and expertise have created a comprehensiveness to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Professional Linux Programming</em></span> not often found
in &ldquo;tech-lit&rdquo;. If only more authors follow these gentlemen's fine
example of collaboration.</p><p>The publishers, Wrox Press, even provide a support site for
programmers:
<a href="http://p2p.wrox.com" target="_self">http://p2p.wrox.com/</a>. This
includes source code used in the book, as well as a forum for
discussing programming issues.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a41580.0x2b3a3c8"></a>Where the Book Falls Short</h2></div></div><p>If you're a Debian developer, or want to be, this book will
help in numerous respects, but there is no discussion of the .deb
package format, or its relevant tools. Given the increasing numbers
of developers who want to develop applications for Debian (or
Corel, or Storm, or Libranet, or...), the topic would have merited
at least a passing mention. The Connectiva Discovery (a version of
APT that is RPM-aware) aside, the ubiquity of RPMs negatively
impacts their wonderfulness.</p><p>Additionally, there are no autographs in the book. One can
only assume this is rectifiable solely through writing to the
authors and asking them sweetly for their missing signatures (you
may need to send return postage).</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner!</p></div></div>
