    This month's feature articles show that even with the additions that accompany hitting the big time,
    the Linux community has maintained a balance between the scramble for cash and keeping the philanthropic element as far
    from moribundity as possible.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf3f580.0x1037240"></a></h2></div></div><p>The market for certification programs for
Linux professionals, such as the Linux Professional Institute, Sair
and Red Hat's RHCE, is evidence that Linux has gained a sure
foothold in the business and computer-professional world.
</p><p>However, many Linux enthusiasts feel that as the use of the
open-source OS moves into the realm of mainstream business and
attracts the development and marketing dollars of large
corporations it is losing some of the qualities that make it
attractive, that the addition of both big(ger) business and money
to the Linux community adulterates what began as a hobbyist's free,
and dare I say ethical, operating system.</p><p>The mix of this month's focus articles on training and
certification shows that even with the additions that accompany
hitting the big time, the Linux community has maintained a balance
between the scramble for &ldquo;filthy lucre&rdquo; and keeping the
philanthropic element as far from moribundity as possible.</p><p>Linux is about accessibility&mdash;accessibility to software, code
and technical advice and support from the community of users.
Unfortunately, most of this support is available only on the
Internet. Geekcorps is a nonprofit that takes Linux support, or
rather education, to the doors of those who need it most. Ana Maria
Harkins, in her article on page 80 describes it as a &ldquo;Peace Corps
for techies&rdquo;. Their volunteers are presently working hard at
making Linux accessible to those in Ghana, and Ana Maria describes
what it takes to be, and to train, a Geekcorps volunteer.</p><p>An official certification of Linux competence can speed the
adoption of the operating system by dispelling the perception that
there is a lack of people who comprehend it. &ldquo;Linux certified&rdquo; on
r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, clues employers in to the fact that there
are people who know it, and at the same time it encourages job
seekers to learn it to sharpen the edge on their
r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. As Don Marti says, &ldquo;Certification programs
are a powerful self-reinforcing consensus reality for promoting an
OS, even if they don't teach anything. Any learning you get in the
process is pure gravy.&rdquo;</p><p>Tobin Maginnis, president of Sair Linux and GNU
Certification, gives some additional good reasons for Linux system
administrators to have their knowledge certified (page 84). As he
points out, the growing demand for Linux certification is a
validation of the work of Linux developers and evangelists to move
the operating system into more widespread usage. Maginnis also
explains Sair's methods and vendor-neutral philosophy.</p><p>The LPI (Linux Professional Institute) is a dot org that
demonstrates the active spirit of the Linux community through its
reliance on community input. Richard Morgan, after completing the
LPI certification first-level exam, shares his thoughts and
comments as to why the LPI process has room for improvement but is
still one of the best ways to improve one's r&eacute;sum&eacute;
(page 86).</p><p>&mdash;Richard Vernon, Editor in Chief</p></div></div>
