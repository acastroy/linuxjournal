server, one ability that always seems to come up is remote access,
or the ability to get into the server to do anything that needs
doing, without needing to be where the machine is. Linux&mdash;UNIX in
general&mdash;handles that wonderfully. Unfortunately, PCs don't. To
access CMOS settings or watch a system boot, you need to have a
display attached, and you need to be there watching. There is
nothing Linux, or any operating system, can do about it.
</p><p>But the PC Weasel can help. The PC Weasel is an ISA card that
replaces the system video card in servers intended for headless
(without monitor and keyboard) operation. It acts as a video card
and, with the connection of a short cable between the card and the
system's keyboard port, as a keyboard too. With the PC Weasel, the
monitor and keyboard are replaced by an RS-232 connection and any
standard terminal emulation (VT100 or ANSI) running on anything
from a dumb terminal to a handheld computer to another
server.</p><p>That isn't all the Weasel can do. On motherboards with reset
connectors, the PC Weasel can provide remote reset control that
allows you to reboot locked servers or disable computers that may
be causing problems on your network. There is also a watchdog timer
mode, allowing the PC Weasel to reset the system automatically if
the OS locks up, or it at least stops telling the card that
everything is okay. Watchdog support requires kernels with
PC-Weasel watchdog support, and you may need to patch your kernel
to get this.</p><p>Having a serial console on a PC provides many advantages, not
the least of which is that you can control a lot of computers from
one workstation by using multiport serial cards or inexpensive
RS-232 switch boxes to connect all of the headless servers to the
workstation. This can save effort and time if you have a lot of
rackmounted PCs. But, far more valuable, the PC Weasel allows you
to place servers in remote locations and provide true remote
administration. You can connect a standard external modem to the PC
Weasel and have dial-in access to the computer&mdash;not just the
running operating system, but the whole machine. You can watch the
system self-test, change BIOS settings, view POST codes, diagnose
failed hardware and do a few other jobs that usually mean having
someone present with the computer.</p><p>And the PC Weasel isn't limited to Linux. It will work with
any OS that supports text-mode video, including DOS and most UNIX
variants.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1330580.0x1428e48"></a>Documentation</h2></div></div><p>The PC Weasel manual is a spiral bound mini-tome of
engineering wit and detail&mdash;a lot of detail, including everything
from how to set the board jumpers to compiling custom code to run
on the PC Weasel's on-board microprocessors. Though it tends to
jump into low-level details with both feet, there is enough general
information that anyone with a fair tolerance for jargon can get
what they need. Given that the PC Weasel is aimed at a
traditionally tech-savvy user base (system administrators,
technical support personnel, embedded systems developers, etc.),
the documentation is probably exactly right: human enough to be fun
to read, but technical enough to be precise.</p><p>These days, when it seems like everyone has ADD, a lot of
people (me, for example) would benefit from a single-page reference
guide with nothing but the few facts most people would need who use
the PC Weasel card. The card is fairly self-explanatory, but such a
guide would be nice.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1330580.0x1428fa8"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>First the limitations: you need an available ISA slot; the PC
Weasel doesn't come in a PCI version. Second, you can't have
another video card installed in the computer alongside the PC
Weasel. Given that, installing the PC Weasel is fairly simple,
provided your computer's motherboard is willing. An unfortunate
number of modern motherboards have video controllers built in, and
unless the on-board video disables itself properly when the
PC-Weasel card is installed, you may have problems. The PC Weasel's
keyboard connection is made by way of an external jumper cable that
is just a little bit messy and prone to being yanked out by
careless people working around the computer. The reset feature
requires that your motherboard have a reset jumper, a feature that
a few new motherboards seem to be skipping.</p><p>The most painful part of installing a PC Weasel may very well
be finding an ISA slot and the reset jumper on your motherboard.
After removing the old video card, inserting the PC Weasel and
hooking up the various cables and connecting your RS-232 cable to a
PC or terminal, everything pretty much works.</p><p>The PC Weasel defaults to a safe 9600 baud communications
rate, adjustable once a terminal is connected. The configuration is
stored in nonvolatile EEPROM, so you don't have to worry much about
forgetting your settings.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1330580.0x1429160"></a>How Well Does It Work?</h2></div></div><p>Before I get into how well it works, here's a few words about
how it works. It is important to note that in many ways the PC
Weasel is an independent computer that talks to the system through
some fairly narrow channels, and the narrowness of the connection
provides for rather narrow areas of dependence. The first and most
basic of the dependencies is power: the PC Weasel draws power from
the system motherboard, and as long as the system motherboard has
power, the PC Weasel runs. When the system is powered on, the PC
Weasel boots separately, and runs separately, from the system CPU.
This has some very positive implications for remote administration
because it means that you can connect to a system even if the
motherboard has completely locked up, as long as there is power.
You'll only see the last screen the system displayed before it
crashed, but at least you'll see something, and because the PC
Weasel has abilities that go beyond a display and keyboard, you can
perform a hard reset of the locked-up computer and then watch it
boot without disconnecting and having to wait, blind and hoping,
for the system to start.</p><p>Anyone who has ever had to call a remote office, data center
or business to ask them to reboot a server, and has had to wheedle
and beg to get someone to spend the five minutes it takes to find
the (hopefully) right server and press the reset button, will
appreciate being able to perform their own rebooting and watch it
happen.</p><p>That said, there are some limitations: you get nothing but
text. Forget about boot graphics or fancy boot loaders; absolutely
forget about X or using any operating system that has forgotten how
to think in ASCII; text is what you'll get, so save the graphics
for after the OS has booted, when you can use OS-level remote
access.</p><p>And the necessary kludges: a terminal doesn't have all the
keys a 104-key keyboard has. And even if it did, it probably
wouldn't have a Remote Reset Button key, or a Configure the PC
Weasel Card key. The solution is to use an &ldquo;attention&rdquo; keystroke
to bring up PC Weasel-specific menus, similar to many Telnet
applications. The default attention keystroke is Ctrl-^ or Ctrl-~
(depending on your terminal), though that can be reconfigured. When
you send the attention keystoke, a command prompt appears at the
top of the screen. From there, you can type a single-character
command, or a multicharacter mnemonic that represents one of the
keys not available on most terminals. For example, when you are in
the attention mode, typing <b  >xlshift</b> is the same
as pressing (and releasing) the left Shift key. The command
<span   class="bold"><b>xscrllk</b></span> is like pressing the
Scroll Lock key. This is somewhat typing intensive but allows you
to access all of the keyboard functions. It is also fairly
unimportant when dealing with operating systems like Linux; as it's
designed to be terminal-friendly, you rarely need to go beyond the
keys a terminal would have anyway. There are also special sequences
for using the Ctrl, Alt and Shift keys as modifiers, so you can,
for example, send a three fingered salute by typing a command like
<b  >xc-a-del</b>.</p><p>The most valuable application of the PC Weasel is in remote
servers. Whether you have a web server colocated in an ISP or a
data logger on the side of a mountain, having to drive hours&mdash;or
worse, wake someone up so they can unlock the site to let you
in&mdash;to get to your server can be a killer. Having another way into
your equipment can be a lifesaver. Most of us count on SSH or
Telnet to get us in, but when the normal communication paths go
away, being able to make contact could save you the price of the PC
Weasel the first time something went wrong.</p><p>To make the PC Weasel even more useful, it has another
feature for those who need to move data as well as control the
machine: the card can be used as a standard serial port by the PC
in a passthrough mode where data coming from the serial port is
passed over the line that would normally provide screen and
keyboard information. How is this useful? If you are setting up a
remote data logger or need to be able to move information, not
screens, you can have system software use the PC Weasel's serial
port and carry out all communications through a single modem or
serial cable. I didn't try this, but it should also be possible to
connect to a computer using the PC Weasel's serial console and
start a PPP connection over that serial port, allowing both core
system access when something has gone wrong and TCP/IP for the more
flexible access it provides.</p><p>Within the limitations of its hardware and the emulations it
connects to, the PC Weasel works very well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1330580.0x1429580"></a>For Remote Embedded Systems People</h2></div></div><p>Okay, you aren't a system administrator. You don't care about
web servers. You do care about real-world solutions, and those
solutions involve putting a PC somewhere in the real-world. And, in
the real world, that means that every once in a while one of the
people you sold your real-world solution to calls and asks, quite
reasonably, why it isn't doing anything. You have a few weapons in
your arsenal to answer those questions. Maybe you have
<span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> set up waiting for an
incoming call on a modem line, maybe
<span   class="bold"><b>getty</b></span> is good enough, maybe you've
been selling these systems so long that you've got DOS and a
five-year-old copy of Closeup. Whatever you have, it works, but all
too often you've got to call your customer and have them go over
and do something to the system you sold them. The PC Weasel, out of
the box, can do a lot toward making those calls disappear: the
watchdog timer will hide persistent problems, and the reliability
of not counting on remote-access software loaded after the OS will
keep you from needing to call and ask someone to kick the hardware
(or worse, sending someone driving/flying to do the same job), but
the PC Weasel can be made to do more. By writing your own software
to run <span   class="emphasis"><em>on</em></span> the PC Weasel, you can make the
Weasel smart about the problems you face. For example, you could
change the watchdog timer to automatically call your pager to let
you know something went wrong rather than simply resetting the
computer. Or if you want to get fancy, you could write software to
watch the screen automatically for specific messages and type
preconfigured commands when they are seen, perhaps restarting your
crashing software or performing a soft reboot rather than an
imperious hard reset. The PC Weasel includes a software API and
information (including sample code snippets) on writing custom
software to run on the card, independent of the system CPU.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1330580.0x1429790"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>The PC Weasel adds to the capabilities of a standard PC
running any text-mode operating system, providing a watchdog timer,
remote reboot capability and a serial console to make bringing
large numbers of server consoles to one workstation or remotely
accessing those same servers in a cost-effective manner. However,
it may not be the best choice for everyone. At $250 each, you need
to take a hard look at how much the card will save you. How often
do your servers crash? How much effort and time is involved in
hooking a keyboard and CRT up so you can watch them reboot? If the
server is at the other end of an airplane flight, the PC Weasel is
a no-brainer, but if the server is at the other end of the room, or
if pressing the reset button is a telephone call away, it may not
be the right choice.</p></div></div>
