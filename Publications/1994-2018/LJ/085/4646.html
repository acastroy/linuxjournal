March 2001] is great! Unfortunately, your tech ignored least common
multiples and lowest common denominators. With the numbers given in
paragraph five, you will <span   class="bold"><b>fsck</b></span> all
four filesystems every 15th reboot, making the problem worse than
the default scenario.</p><p>A better approach is to use prime numbers like 13, 17, 19 and
23. This way, you won't fsck two filesystems until the 221st reboot
(13*17), and you won't fsck all four filesystems until the 96,577th
reboot. Assuming an average uptime of 90 days (bad hardware,
security updates), this is in the year 25,814.</p><p>&mdash;George Toft</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2949580.0x2a41348"></a>Awkward Solution</h2></div></div><p>I found Mick Bauer's proposed solution on page 33 [&ldquo;Paranoid

script this way will result in a failure if you upgrade. (For
example, <span   class="bold"><b>ude</b></span> to a security fix in

<span   class="bold"><b>chkconfig</b></span>. So the sample should

</p><p>&mdash;Hugo van der Kooij</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bauer replies:</b></span> You are of
course correct, chkconfig is the preferred way to manage
startup-scripts in Red Hat. I didn't know this, having only
recently switched from SuSE to Red Hat. But &ldquo;awkward&rdquo;? My way is
common practice on most of the SysVInit implementations I deal
with, including SuSE (unless SuSE 7.1 is different&mdash;haven't tried
it yet). Regardless, I consider this a minor point: any upgrade
&ldquo;failure&rdquo; caused by my method would be easy to fix. The only such
weirdness I've experienced myself has been the occasional creation
of redundant symbolic links, which I'd hardly categorize as a
failure.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2949580.0x2a41710"></a>Mandrake 7.2 Review</h2></div></div><p>I am greatly concerned about the review of Mandrake 7.2 found
in the March 2001 issue. To cut to the chase, Mandrake works almost
flawlessly out of the box, and many of the problems were as a
result of the reviewer trying to install Helix GNOME on top of the
Distribution (Helix GNOME has known errors and does not support
Mandrake7.2). Taking screen shots in the GIMP does work out of the
box, just not with the Helix version, which was obviously tacked on
after the fact. The lack of a back button is absolutely false
because the installer does not need a back button. (The installer
screen has icons on the side which allow you to jump to any point
in the install and shows you where you are in the
installation.)</p><p>The sidebar says that Mandrake includes Helix GNOME; this is
false. It does include GNOME, but not Helix. In fact, Helix does
not even support Mandrake 7.2 (but it does support earlier
versions).</p><p>I personally run Mandrake 7.2 both at work and at home, out
of the box, and it runs almost flawlessly (though there are a few
minor issues, but updates are available). I have also tried the
GNOME formerly known as Helix on one of my 7.2 machines and found
that it did break many things. The point is, Mandrake 7.2 worked
fine out of the box and only started breaking after adding Helix
GNOME!</p><p>&mdash;Chris Hendrickson</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Black replies:</b></span> As clearly
stated in the article, the review I did was, evidently and
provably, not of the final released version. I twice inquired of
Mandrakesoft regarding this and they would not answer my e-mail.
None of the Helix/Ximian problems evaporated with a clean,
Helix/Ximian-free installation, and while the stars on the left
side of the screen do work as back buttons, this sure isn't obvious
to the Mandrake newbie. I have heard some wonderful things about
the actual release version of Mandrake. I'm thinking about
downloading it and putting it on a server, as it seems to work
especially well in that capacity. Its security is well-noted. But
as a reviewer, I can only work with what is sent. I can do the
research, ask the questions (or try to), etc., but I can't say
&ldquo;well, gee, this is marvelous&rdquo; if I can't run the software in a
normal fashion. I have a rule for developing software: if I can
break software with my innocuous little system, then that software
probably needs fixing anyway.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2949580.0x2a419d0"></a>OpenSSH and DSA Keys</h2></div></div><p>Mick Bauer's &ldquo;The 101 Uses of OpenSSH: Part 2&rdquo; [February
2001] is an excellent article with a small flaw. He writes: &ldquo;To
specify a particular key to use in either an ssh or scp session,
use the -i [flag].&rdquo; He also provides an example that suggests the
use of DSA keys.</p><p>However, OpenSSH did not support the use of DSA keys with the
-i flag until the very latest version (2.5.1, released just four
days ago). Earlier versions silently ignored the DSA key indicated
(RSA keys work just fine). Hence, anyone trying that example will
see ssh mysteriously default to password authentication every
time.</p><p>This limitation is actually documented in the ssh man page.
Versions prior to 2.5.1 said:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
-i identity_file&lt;\n&gt;
  Selects the file from which the identity
  (private key) for RSA authentication is read. [...]
</pre><p>Version 2.5.1, of course, says &ldquo;...RSA or DSA...&rdquo;. However,
it's easy for even experienced users to miss the distinction&mdash;I
certainly did the first few times.

[March 2001] Mick Bauer covered ways of securing DMZ hosts. In my
opinion he missed a simple but very efficient tool to detect
intruders at DMZ hosts or firewalls: Tripwire. It calculates
checksums for all files on the system and stores these fingerprints
in a database. Doing a compare run against this database in regular
intervals (cron), it is easy to detect changes. If somebody
modified /bin/login, /etc/passwd or installed other back doors, you
will realize it at least after the next compare run. The key is to
store Tripwire itself and the initial database on read-only media
(e.g., CD-ROM) to prevent modifications. There is no way in doing
the same with <span   class="bold"><b>diff</b></span>, as mentioned
in the article.</p><p>Tripwire is commercial software now, but there is a GNU GPL
edition for Linux available at
<a href="http://www.tripwire.org" target="_self">www.tripwire.org</a> and
<a href="http://www.tripwire.com" target="_self">www.tripwire.com/</a>.
There is another GPL'd software dealing with the same subject, but
I never tried it. It is at
<a href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~rammer/aide.html" target="_self">www.cs.tut.fi/~rammer/aide.html</a>.</p><p>Another issue is the design of the DMZ shown in Figure 2. I
wouldn't recommend having all hosts in a single DMZ. If you are
using three different boxes for doing the job, you should use three
DMZs as well . If one of the machines is compromised by an
intruder, he has to cross the firewall again to attack the others.
So fill up your firewall with additional NICs and use crossed
cables&mdash;you won't need a switch either.</p><p>Regards</p><p>&mdash;Markus Hogger</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2949580.0x2a42058"></a>FAT Problems</h2></div></div><p>I enjoyed Robin Rowes' article, &ldquo;Debian Multiboot
Installation&rdquo; <i  >LJ</i>, March 2001, but have a
couple of points to make about it. In the part about running
rawrite2.exe, it is implied that you can't run this program from a
FAT32 partition. This is wrong; the versions of DOS that come with
Win98 (and Win95 OSR2) know about FAT32 (but not long filenames);
otherwise, they wouldn't be able to boot Windows from a FAT32
partition either. Perhaps the author had FIPS (the DOS
repartitioning tool) in mind at the time, the original versions of
which cannot handle FAT32.</p><p>A discussion of the problems with WindowsME would have been
useful. This is basically Windows98 with a flashier GUI and other
useless features, except Microsoft tried as hard as possible to
stop you from running its DOS in &ldquo;real&rdquo; (16-bit) mode, mainly by
nobbling the FORMAT and SYS commands and removing the options for
starting or restarting in DOS mode.</p><p>To boot to DOS in WindowsME, create a startup floppy from
Control Panel --&gt; Add/Remove Programs --&gt; Startup Disk. If
you reboot the PC from this floppy and select the Minimal Boot
option, you will end up at a DOS prompt from which you can change
to drive C: and run the rawrite2.exe program as instructed in the
article. Alternatively, you could get your own back on Microsoft by
nobbling the startup floppy to get CD support and a DOS prompt
without any of that Windows recovery malarkey. (The easiest way is
just to rename the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.)</p><p>Also, a lot of the pathnames in the article use
forwardslashes instead of backslashes.</p><p>&mdash;Ian Abbott</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Rowe replies:</b></span> You are
correct that covering WinME would have been nice. The only reason I
didn't was I don't have a copy and didn't want to buy one. Thanks
for the nice notes on how to use it. Another interesting approach
that I haven't tried is using WinImage to create the Debian
floppies. I think you are right about being able to see a FAT32
partition when booting from a newer DOS. I haven't tried that in a
long time, since I generally prefer FAT16 or NTFS partitions. I
should have created a FAT32 partition to test that, but was in a
rush to complete the article and didn't. Thanks for the correction.
I've never used FIPS. Forwardslashes are correct in UNIX or
Windows, although Windows persists in defaulting to backslashes.
Using forwardslashes everywhere is a habit I picked up in writing
portable code. Unfortunately, that only works with UNIX and
Windows. The Mac doesn't like slashes (forward or back). Darwin
will, I hope, change that. If you go to the file search box in
Win2k, for instance, and use forwardslashes, that works fine. The
one place it won't accept forwardslashes is at the DOS command
prompt.</p></div></div>
