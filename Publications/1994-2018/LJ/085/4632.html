    Tobin Maginnis, Sair president, provides some arguments in favor of
    Linux certification.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c58580.0x1d50608"></a></h2></div></div><p>William Shakespeare penned the famous
line in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hamlet</em></span>, &ldquo;To be or not to be. That is
the question.&rdquo; If you are a Linux disciple, chances are you ask
that same question today with an open-source twist: &ldquo;To be or not
to be certified. That is the question.&rdquo; The fact is, the Linux
community is somewhat divided on the answer to this question.
</p><p>One camp, often referred to as the &ldquo;live free or die&rdquo;
followers, believes there is no reason to be certified. Their
assumption is that because Linux&mdash;unlike such competitors as
Microsoft and Novell&mdash;is open-source software that can be
downloaded free off the Internet, knowledge and practical skill
development come with hands-on, job-related experience and will not
necessarily be bolstered by certification.</p><p>An opposing view, however, is that certification means
validation. If a third party, or independent source, tests your
skills and finds you possess the knowledge to run a complex
operating system&mdash;one that is predicted to grow faster over the
next four years than all other operating systems combined, it can
benefit both the IT professional and the company that hires him or
her.</p><p>The problem is not unlike owning a $100,000 Porsche and
trusting it to a certified service representative over a gas
station mechanic with no concrete credentials.</p><p>Certification means money, both to the company and the
certified employee. The benefits to the company are numerous.
Research by International Data Corporation (IDC) shows IT managers
trained and certified in Microsoft, Novell and Cisco programming
have a positive impact in the workplace. The same will hold true
with certified Linux professionals.</p><p>The certified shop is apt to be more efficient and
productive. A certified IT employee can usually configure a desktop
or server in a more timely manner than one who is not certified.
The properly trained Linux programmer will be able to keep the
server up and running, while some noncertified employees may depend
on trial and error.</p><p>A certified shop can traditionally handle twice as much
equipment as a noncertified shop, and a certified shop of employees
can usually create a much more elaborate and complex network
configuration.</p><p>In general, the cost of training pays for itself in just nine
months. Additionally, certification is frequently used by IT and
human resource managers to weed through stacks of
r&eacute;sum&eacute;s.</p><p>For the certified employee, benefits include higher salary,
more job satisfaction, job security and greater knowledge that
leads to more independence. More often than not, numero uno in the
employee's book is better pay. Studies have shown certification in
a desired skill such as Linux will lead to salary increases of
$5-$10 per hour over noncertified peers. That translates to a
$10-$20,000 increase per year in salary. Some find that
certification also brings a sense of accomplishment and greater job
satisfaction. So why Linux instead of those proprietary operating
systems?</p><p>As already mentioned, Linux has emerged as the number two
operating system worldwide and is predicted to grow faster than all
other operating systems combined. A recent poll of more than 2,000
IT managers by Survey.com, an on-line research service, indicated a
planned 500% increase in applications development for Linux over
the next two years. International Data Corporation reports that
while Linux is not a major market at the moment (estimated at $56
million for 2001), Linux support revenue will increase to $285
million in 2004, a compound annual growth rate of 86.9%.</p><p>Louis Gerstner, IBM's president and CEO, sent shock waves
through the technology world in December when he announced the
technology giant would invest $1 billion in Linux in 2001 alone. He
called Linux the best way to meet demands on the Internet.</p><p>IBM's track record bodes well for the future of Linux. The
personal computer had been around for almost ten years before IBM,
in 1983, introduced a PC that revolutionized the technology. The
rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>IBM stated its belief in Linux as early as January 10, 1999,
when it proclaimed in a <span   class="emphasis"><em>New York Times</em></span> story
that Linux would be the third wave in computer technology,
following the PC and the Internet.</p><p>IBM is not the only company out there using Linux. Others
include Sony Electronics, ZDNet, Sallie Mae, Boeing and Compaq,
just to name a few. Linux will not be a one-size-fits-all approach
for every company's technology needs. But nearly all companies will
benefit by using Linux in certain applications.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c58580.0x1d50c38"></a>Sair Linux and GNU Certification</h2></div></div><p>Sair Linux and GNU Certification, in our humble and somewhat
partisan opinion, offers the best of all worlds. Sair Linux and GNU
Certification has grown from a college student's simple question to
his instructor (that would be me) just three years ago&mdash;&ldquo;Is there
a Linux certificate available?&rdquo;&mdash;to a growing 100-employee company
attracting students globally.</p><p>Sair Linux and GNU Certification provides multilayered,
vendor-neutral training that has, in a few short years, produced
1,000 certified professionals and an additional 200 Linux certified
administrators. Our training is administered through accredited
centers of education (ACEs), which includes New Horizon Learning
Centers and Productivity Point International training centers.
Testing is offered through Thomson Prometric and VUE testing
centers, and self-study guides are available through John Wiley
&amp; Sons Publishing.</p><p>Being vendor-neutral allows us to offer comprehensive
training by offering instruction in a minimum of seven different
Linux versions. We believe certification tied to a specific vendor
will ultimately succeed or fail depending on that vendor's
success.</p><p>Sair Linux and GNU Certification differs from other Linux
certification efforts in other ways. SLGC does not publish
standalone tests. Instead, Sair Linux and GNU Certification
provides a knowledge array with a detailed set of objectives and
competencies. This allows the Sair Linux and GNU Certification
curriculum to be more focused and written to offer the best
opportunity to pass the tests. The detailed knowledge array
requirements also provide the necessary guidelines for others to
write study guides for our exams.</p><p>Our results are not based on &ldquo;psychometric&rdquo; normative data.
Instead, results are absolute; each exam contains 50 questions and
37 (or 74%) must be answered correctly for a passing grade. It does
not matter what Joe or Hildegard scored on the test, all that
matters is that you demonstrate mastery of the material by scoring
74% or better.</p><p>Level I provides a lengthy peer-reviewed and solid foundation
of Linux education and contains four exams. You earn the Sair Linux
and GNU Certified Professional (LCP) designation after passing
either of the two initial exams: Installation and Configuration or
System Administration. The Sair Linux and GNU Certified
Administrator (LCA) designation is earned upon successful
completion of the remaining two Level I exams: Networking and
Security, and Ethics and Privacy.</p><p>The recently announced Level II curriculum differs slightly.
Where Level I is considered more &ldquo;academic&rdquo;, Level II focuses on
various applications and practical uses.</p><p>The Sair Linux and GNU Certified Engineer (LCE) designation
is earned by passing the Core Concepts and Practices (CCP) course
and three elective courses. The curriculum is known as AMPS, an
acronym derived from the many applications that run on Linux.
Currently there are seven electives to choose from with more to be
unveiled this year. AMPS allows candidates to select the
applications that match their job descriptions. Do you want to be a
web service provider? Or do you want to be a system administrator
or work in a highly secured environment? You can custom-tailor your
courseware based on how you plan to use Linux and GNU
software.</p><p>A third level, that of Linux Certified Master Engineer, will
be announced in 2002.</p><p>Naysayers may continue to look down on certification and
training. And if they want to think certification is silly, that's
fine. They can sit in their ivory towers and program. But, to
paraphrase Shakespeare, &ldquo;Wherefore art thou?&rdquo;</p></div></div>
