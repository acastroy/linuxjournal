    The explosive growth of the Internet was made possible, in part,
    by DNS.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcfb580.0xdf35b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The domain name system (DNS) hums along
behind the scenes and, as with running water, we largely take it
for granted. That this system just works is a testament to the
hackers who designed and developed DNS and the open-source package
called Bind, thereby introducing a scalable Internet to the world.
Before DNS and Bind, /etc/hosts was the only way to translate IP
addresses to human-friendly hostnames and vice versa.
</p><p>This article will introduce the concepts of DNS and three
commands with which you can examine DNS information:
<span   class="bold"><b>host</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>dig</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>nslookup</b></span>.</p><p>The DNS is a distributed, hierarchical database where
authority flows from the top (or root) of the hierarchy downward.
When <i  >Linux Journal</i> registered
linuxjournal.com, they got permission from an entity that had
authority at the root or top level. The Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and a domain name registrar,
transferred authority for linuxjournal.com to <i  >Linux Journal</i>, which now has the authority to create
subdomains such as embedded.linuxjournal.com, without the
involvement of ICANN and a domain name registrar.</p><p>When trying to understand the structure of the DNS, think of
an inverted tree&mdash;the very structure of the UNIX filesystem. Each
branch of the tree is within a <span   class="emphasis"><em>zone</em></span> of
authority; more than one branch of this tree can be within a single
zone. <i  >Linux Journal</i> could choose to retain
authority for embedded.linuxjournal.com, or they could delegate it
down the tree to someone else who could make subdomains such as
zeus.embedded.linuxjournal.com.</p><p>The software (usually Bind) that stores domain name
information is called a domain <span   class="emphasis"><em>name server</em></span>. A
single name server can be authoritative for multiple zones. All
zones have a primary master and a secondary master name server that
provides authoritative responses for their zones.</p><p>If you query a name server not authoritative for a particular
zone, that name server will most likely return the correct
information. This is because zone information propagates throughout
the Internet, and name servers cache zone information for which
they are not authoritative.</p><p>When you register a new domain name, transfer your old one to
a new host or just make changes to the zone database file, it often
takes several days for the new information to propagate completely.
During that interim period, nonauthoritative name servers often
temporarily cache stale information about your domain name.</p><p>You may wonder how you fit into this process when you use the
Internet. Well, whenever you use the Web, Telnet, FTP, etc., your
software uses the resolver (the client side of the DNS), which is a
set of library routines compiled into programs such as Mozilla.
When you type <b  >www.linuxjournal.com</b>, the resolver
sets up the query to the name server that does the work of
translating www.linuxjournal.com to 207.178.22.49 so you can get to
the web site.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcfb580.0xdf3c38"></a>DNS Commands</h2></div></div><p>For comprehensive coverage of DNS and DNS commands, read the
man pages and get one of the excellent DNS books on the market,
such as O'Reilly's <span   class="emphasis"><em>DNS and Bind</em></span> and Sybex's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux DNS Server Administration</em></span>.</p><p>Zone file database records divide DNS information into three
primary types: NS (name server) records, MX (mail exchange) records
and A (Address) records. NS records indicate the name servers. MX
records indicate the hosts that handle e-mail delivery; the
priority (pri) number indicates the order in which mail servers are
used, with the lowest number receiving the highest priority. The A
(Address) records map hostnames to IP addresses, the real names of
machines.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcfb580.0xdf3e48"></a>host</h2></div></div><p>This is the simplest of the DNS commands. It is a quick way
to determine the IP address of a hostname:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
host www.linuxjournal.com
www.linuxjournal.com has address 207.178.22.49
www.linuxjournal.com mail is handled (pri=80)
by www.ssc.com
www.linuxjournal.com mail is handled (pri=10)
by mail.ssc.com
www.linuxjournal.com mail is handled (pri=40)
by cascadia.a42.com
</pre><p>The -a option will return all of the DNS information in
verbose format, as seen in Listing 1.
</p><p><a href="4597l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. DNS Information in
Verbose Format with -a Option</a></p><p>Now that you know the IP address for www.linuxjournal.com,
you might want to make sure the reverse lookup works. The reverse
lookup checks to see if the reverse zone file maps the IP address
to the hostname:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
host 207.178.22.49 49.22.178.207.IN-ADDR.ARPA
domain name pointer www.linuxjournal.com
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcfb580.0xdf4160"></a>dig (domain information groper)</h2></div></div><p>This powerful command gathers and returns DNS information in
a format the name server can use directly. For this reason, dig is
particularly useful in scripts. You will find it easy to query
specific name servers with dig, making it a useful tool for
narrowing down the source of DNS problems.</p><p>Suppose you have just transferred your domain name hosting
from old-host.com to new-host.com. A customer sends you an e-mail
saying he cannot reach your web site when he is logged into his
ISP. You suspect the zone information simply has not had time to
propagate. So, you find out what the NS records are for the ISP in
question:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dig ns isp-in-question.com

;; ANSWER SECTION:
isp-in-question.com.  10H IN NS ns1.hugeupstream.com.
isp-in-question.com.  10H IN NS isp-in-question.com.
isp-in-question.com.  10H IN NS ns.isp-in-question.com.
isp-in-question.com.  10H IN NS ns.goodnameserver.com.
</pre><p>Then you check your company's web site against the ISP's name
servers:
<pre     class="programlisting">
dig www.yourcompany.com @ns.isp-in-question.com

;; ANSWER SECTION:
www.yourcompany.com.       59m53s IN A   192.168.5.10
</pre>


Wait a minute, that is your old IP address. It appears the DNS
information has not fully propagated yet.
</p><p>Next, you decide to see if old-host.com has removed the old
zone information from their name servers. The &ldquo;any&rdquo; option will
retrieve all the DNS information:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dig any www.yourcompany.com @ns.old-host.com

;; ANSWER SECTION:
www.yourcompany.com.    1H IN A    192.168.200.250

;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
yourcompany.com.        1H IN NS   webns.new-isp.com.
yourcompany.com.        1H IN NS   srvns.new-isp.com.
</pre><p>In this case the A record shows your new IP address for your
web server, and it shows the new authoritative name servers for
your domain name. This is the information you hoped to find.
</p><p>These are the most useful dig query types: dig any (gathers
all DNS information), dig ns (gathers name server information), dig
mx (gathers mail exchanger information) and dig a (gathers network
address information).</p><p>The dig command can also do reverse lookups with output
formatted for the zone file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dig -x 192.168.200.250
;; ANSWER SECTION: 250.200.168.192.in-addr.arpa.
4h11s IN PTR  www.yourcompany.com.
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcfb580.0xdf45d8"></a>nslookup</h2></div></div><p>You can use this tool as a single line command, or you can
use it interactively, which distinguishes it from the other DNS
commands. Once you have started nslookup, type <b  >set
all</b> to list the default options. As with dig you can
choose the server (name server) you want to query, and you can
decide the type of DNS information on which to focus.</p><p><a href="4597l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Output with
nslookup</a></p><p>Just as you can issue commands to nslookup interactively, you
can also change the initial defaults by starting a .nslookuprc
file. The format of the .nslookup is one command per line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
set type=NS
set domain=srvns.new-host.com
set timeout=10
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcfb580.0xdf4898"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The ARPANET (the precursor to the Internet) had a few hundred
hosts throughout the 1970s. A single flat file called HOSTS.TXT
contained all of the information for every host. System
administrators periodically downloaded the file and placed the
information into their /etc/hosts file; take a look at your own
/etc/hosts to see roughly what that file looked like. However, this
system was not scalable. The advent of DNS made the exponential
growth of the Internet possible.</p></div></div>
