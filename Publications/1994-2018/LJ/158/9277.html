This tutorial jumps right in to the power of Python without dragging you
through basic programming.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17de580.0x18d63a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Python is a programming language that is highly regarded for its
simplicity and ease of use. It often is recommended
to programming newcomers as a good starting point. Python also
is a program that interprets programs written in Python. There are other
implementations of Python, such as Jython (in Java), CLPython (Common Lisp), IronPython
(.NET) and possibly more. Here, we use only Python.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17de580.0x18d6500"></a>
Installing Python</h2></div></div><p>
Installing Python and getting it running is the first step. These days, it
should be very easy. If you are running Gentoo GNU/Linux, you already
have Python 2.4 installed. The packaging system for Gentoo, Portage,
is written in Python. If you don't have it, your installation is broken.
</p><p>
If you are running Debian GNU/Linux, Ubuntu, Kubuntu or MEPIS, simply run
the following (or log in as root and leave out sudo):

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install python
</pre>
</p><p>
One catch is that Debian's stable Python is 2.3, while for the rest of
the distributions,
you are likely to find 2.4. They are not very different, and most code
will run on both versions. The main differences I have encountered are
in the API of some library classes, new features added to 2.4 and some
internals, which shouldn't concern us here.
</p><p>
If you are running some other distribution, it is very likely that Python
is prepackaged for it. Use the usual resources and
tools you use for other packages to find the Python package.
</p><p>
If all that fails, you need to do a manual installation. It is not 
difficult, but be aware that it is easy to break your system
unless you follow this simple guideline: install Python
into a well-isolated place, I like /opt/python/2.4.3, or whatever version
it is.
</p><p>
To perform the installation, download Python, unpack it, and run the
following commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./configure --prefix=/opt/python2.4/
make
make install
</pre>
</p><p>
This task is well documented on Python's README, which is included in
the downloaded tarball; take a look at it for further details. The only
missing task here is adding Python to your path. Alternatively, you can
run it directly by calling it with its path, which I recommend for
initial exploration.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17de580.0x18d6920"></a>
First Steps</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we have Python running, let's jump right in to programming
and examine the language as we go along. To start, let's build a blog
engine. By engine, I mean that it won't have any kind of interface,
such as a Web interface, but it's a good exercise anyway.
</p><p>
Python comes with an REPL&mdash;a nice invention courtesy of the Lisp
community. REPL stands for Read Eval Print Loop, and it means there's
a program that can read expressions and statements, evaluate them,
print the result and wait for more. Let's run the REPL (adjust your path
according to where you installed Python in the previous section):

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ python
Python 2.4.3 (#1, Sep  1 2006, 18:35:05)
[GCC 4.1.1 (Gentoo 4.1.1)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for
more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
Those three greater-than signs (&gt;&gt;&gt;) are the Python prompt where
you write statements and expressions. To quit Python, press Ctrl-D.
</p><p>
Let's type some simple expressions:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; 5
5
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17de580.0x18d6be0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The value of 5 is, well, 5.

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; 10 + 4
14
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17de580.0x18d6d40"></a></h2></div></div><p>
That's more interesting, isn't it? 
</p><p>
There are other kinds of expressions,
such as a string:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; "Hello"
'Hello'
</pre>
</p><p>
Quotes are used to create strings. Single or double quotes 
are treated essentially the same. In fact, you can see that I used double
quotes, and
Python showed the strings in single quotes. 
</p><p>
Another kind of expression
is a list:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; [1,3,2]
[1, 3, 2]
</pre>
</p><p>
Square brackets are used to create lists in which items are separated by
commas. And, as we can add numbers, we can add&mdash;actually
concatenate&mdash;lists:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; [1,3,2] + [11,3,2]
[1, 3, 2, 11, 3, 2]
</pre>
</p><p>
By now, you might be getting bored. Let's switch to something
more exciting&mdash;a blog. A blog is a sequence of posts, and a Python list
is a good way to represent a blog, with posts as strings. In
the REPL, we can build a simple blog like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; ["My first post", "Python is cool"]
['My first post', 'Python is cool']
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
That's a list of strings. You can make lists of whatever you want,
including a list of lists. So far, all our expressions are evaluated,
shown and lost. We have no way to recall our blog to add more items or
to show them in a browser. Assignment comes to the rescue:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; blog = ["My first post", "Python is cool"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</pre>
</p><p>
Now blog, a so-called variable, contains the list. Unlike
in the previous example, nothing was printed this time, because it is an
assignment. Assignments are statements, and statements don't have a return
value. Simply evaluating the variable shows us the content:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; blog
['My first post', 'Python is cool']
</pre>
</p><p>
Accessing our blog is easy. We simply identify each post by number:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; blog[0]
'My first post'
&gt;&gt;&gt; blog[1]
'Python is cool'
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17de580.0x18d7370"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Be aware that Python starts counting at 0.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17de580.0x18d7478"></a>
Encapsulating Behavior</h2></div></div><p>
A blog is not a blog if we can't add new posts, so let's do that:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; blog = blog + ["A new post."]
&gt;&gt;&gt; blog
['My first post', 'Python is cool', 'A new post.']
</pre>
</p><p>
Here we set blog to a new value, which is the old blog, and a new
post. Remembering all that merely to add a new post is not pleasant
though, so
we can encapsulate it in what is called a function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; def add_post(blog, new_post):
...     return blog + [new_post]
...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
def is the keyword used to define a new function or method
(more on functions in structured or functional programming and
methods in object-oriented programming later in this article). What follows is the name of the
function. Inside the parentheses, we have the formal parameters. Those are
like variables that will be defined by the caller of the function. After
the colon, the prompt has changed from &gt;&gt;&gt; to ... to show that we
are inside a definition. The function is composed of all those lines
with a level of indentation below the level of the def line.
</p><p>
So, where other programming languages use curly braces or begin/end
keywords, Python uses indentation. The idea is that if you are a
good programmer, you'd indent it anyway, so we'll use that indentation
and make you a good programmer at the same time. Indeed, it's a controversial
issue; I didn't like it at first, but I learned to live with it.
</p><p>
While working with the REPL, you safely can press Tab to make an
indentation level, and although a Tab character can do it, using four
spaces is the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>strongly</em></span> recommended way. Many text editors know to put
four spaces when you press Tab when editing a Python file. Whatever you do,
never, I repeat, <span   class="emphasis"><em>never</em></span>, mix Tabs with spaces. In other
programming languages, it may make the community dislike you, but in
Python,
it'll make your program fail with weird error messages.
</p><p>
Being practical, to reproduce what I did, simply type the class header,
<tt  >def add_post(blog, new_post):</tt>, press Enter, press
Tab, type <tt  >return
blog + [new_post]</tt>, press Enter, press Enter again, and that's it. Let's
see the function in action:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; blog = add_post(blog, "Fourth post")
&gt;&gt;&gt; blog
['My first post', 'Python is cool', 'A new post.', 
'Fourth post']
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</pre>
</p><p>
add_post takes two parameters. The first is the blog itself, and
it gets assigned to blog. This is tricky. The blog
inside the function is not the same as the blog outside the
function. They are in different scopes. That's why the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; def add_post(blog, new_post):
...     blog = blog + [new_post]
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17de580.0x18d7a50"></a></h2></div></div><p>
doesn't work. blog is modified only inside the function. By
now, you might know that new_post contains the post passed to
the function.
</p><p>
Our blog is growing, and it is time to see that the posts are simply
strings, but we want to have a title and a body. One way to do
this is to use tuples, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; blog = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; blog = add_post(blog, ("New blog", "First post"))
&gt;&gt;&gt; blog = add_post(blog, ("Cool", "Python is cool"))
&gt;&gt;&gt; blog
[('New blog', 'First post'), 
('Cool', 'Python and is cool')]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</pre>
</p><p>
In the first line, I reset the blog to be an empty list. Then, I added two
posts. See the double parentheses? The outside
parentheses are part of the function call, and the inside parentheses 
are the creation of a tuple.
</p><p>
A tuple is created by parentheses, and its members are separated
by commas. They are similar to lists, but semantically, they are
different. For example, you can't update the members of a tuple. Tuples
are used to build some kind of structure with a fixed set of
elements. Let's see a tuple outside of our blog:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; (1,2,3)
(1, 2, 3)
</pre>
</p><p>
Accessing each part of the posts is similar to accessing each part of
the blog:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; blog[0][0]
'New blog'
&gt;&gt;&gt; blog[0][1]
'This is my first post'
</pre>
</p><p>
This might be a good solution if we want to store only a title and a
body. But, how long until we want to add the date and time,
excerpts, tags or messages? You may begin thinking you'll need
to hang a sheet of paper on the wall, as shown in Figure 1, to remember the
index of each field&mdash;not pleasant at all. To solve this problem, and some others,
Python gives us object-oriented programming.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9277f1.large.jpg"><img src="9277f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17de580.0x18ce860"></a>
Object-Oriented Programming</h2></div></div><p>
Object-oriented programming was born more than 20 years ago so 
developers could separate each part of a computer program in a way
similar to 
how objects are separated in the real world. Python models objects by
using classes. A class is an abstract definition of what an object has
and what an object can do. If this sounds foreign, don't worry,
OOP (object-oriented programming) is difficult at first.
</p><p>
An example might help. A bridge is a structure that allows people or
vehicles to cross an obstacle, such as a river, canal or railway. A bridge
has some length, some width and even some color. It may allow vehicles or
only persons. It may allow heavy vehicles or not. When I say
&ldquo;bridge&rdquo;,
I am not defining any of those details. Bridge is a class. If I say
Golden Gate, Le Pont de Normandie or Akashi-Kaikyo, I am naming
particular bridges; they have some specific length, width, vehicle allowance 
and color. In OOP jargon, they are instances of bridge.
</p><p>
Back to our blog, let's create a class to model our post:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Post(object):
...     pass
...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
We start with class, the keyword for creating new classes. Next
comes the name of the class&mdash;in this case, Post. In parentheses, we
have the super-classes&mdash;ignore that for now.
</p><p>
Here again, the prompt has changed from &gt;&gt;&gt; to ..., and Python expects
<span   class="emphasis"><em>something</em></span> in a class. Because we don't want to put
anything in yet, we write <tt  >pass</tt>, which is something, but in fact,
it is nothing. Python knows when a class starts and ends because of the
indentation, the same as with functions.
</p><p>
To reproduce what I did, simply type the class header, <tt  >class
Post(object):</tt>,
press Enter, press Tab, type <tt  >pass</tt>, press Enter,
press Enter again, and
that's it.
</p><p>
Now, we can create a Post:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&gt;&gt;&gt; cool = Post()
&gt;&gt;&gt; cool
&lt;__main__.Post object at 0xb7ca642c&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Note that what is being printed when we evaluate a post is a generic
representation for the object. We can set its title and body:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; cool.title = "Cool"
&gt;&gt;&gt; cool.body = "Python is cool."
</pre>
</p><p>
And retrieve them:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; cool.title
'Cool'
&gt;&gt;&gt; cool.body
'Python is cool.'
</pre>
</p><p>
Up to this point, a Post is like a simple container for anything you can imagine
putting there. The problem with this is we may get lost as to what
to put in it, or what not to put in it. Back to a sheet of paper? No! Although
we can't stop making the posts a container in that way, we
can put some methods there, so users have an idea of what a post may
contain. To do this, we write our own methods in the class Post:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Post(object):
...     def set_title(self, title):
...         self._title = title
...     def get_title(self):
...         return self._title
...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
Methods are like functions, but as they are in a class, they are associated
with the objects of the class. This means different classes can 
have different methods with the same name. Just imagine the difference
between bat.hit(ball) and stick.hit(drum).
</p><p>
Python has a convention that the first parameter (normally called
self) to a method is the object on which we are calling
the method. That means running
<tt  >cool.set_title("Cool")</tt>will
set <tt  >self</tt> to be <tt  >cool</tt>, and
<tt  >title</tt> to be
<tt  >"Cool"</tt>. Running:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cool.set_title("Cool")
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17de580.0x18cf360"></a></h2></div></div><p>
is the equivalent of:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cool._title = "Cool"
</pre>
</p><p>
The leading underscore lets others know that we don't want them
playing with it. It means &ldquo;don't access _title; use get_title and
set_title&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The previous interaction with the cool object can be rewritten as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; cool = Post()
&gt;&gt;&gt; cool.set_title("Cool")
&gt;&gt;&gt; cool.set_body("Python is cool.")
&gt;&gt;&gt; cool.get_title()
'Cool'
&gt;&gt;&gt; cool.get_body()
'Python is cool.'
</pre>
</p><p>
Writing the same set of methods for body should be easy now.
But, be aware that you have to write the whole class in one go. Write
the class header, the set_title and get_title methods, and then create
your set_body and get_body methods. It may take you a couple of tries.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17de580.0x18cf678"></a>
Files</h2></div></div><p>
As the Post class becomes bigger, you'll get tired of rewriting it every
time you want to add a method. If you're tired already, that's a
good sign. And besides, all that's in the REPL will be lost when we quit
Python. We should start saving our work in files.
</p><p>
Python modules are simple text files, and you can use any text editor
you want. As a programmer, you are going to spend most of your time
with your editor, so take some time to choose one you really like
and learn to use it well.
</p><p>
Emacs might not be the most beautiful editor, but for many programming
tasks, it is awesome. (You could read that as &ldquo;I don't like Emacs but
it makes my life so much easier that I keep coming to it time after
time&rdquo;.) Installing Emacs from source is beyond the scope of this
article. As usual, with programs that are so popular, your distribution
is likely to provide it. In Debian and its derivatives try:

<pre     class="programlisting">
apt-get install emacs
</pre>
</p><p>
For Gentoo, the counterpart is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
emerge emacs
</pre>
</p><p>
To achieve the magic I am going to show here, you need python-mode. 
</p><p>
In Debian:

<pre     class="programlisting">
apt-get install python-mode
</pre>
</p><p>
In Gentoo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
emerge python-mode
</pre>
</p><p>
Run Emacs. If you are serious about learning how to use it, now it is
time to press Ctrl-H T, which in Emacs jargon means press Ctrl-H, release it
and then press T. But, you can leave that for later, when you've finished
reading this <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> issue. For this article, I provide all the
keystrokes you need.
</p><p>
Press Ctrl-X Ctrl-F (Ctrl-X, release, Ctrl-F) to visit a file. On the bottom
of the Emacs window, you'll see the cursor waiting for you to type the path and 
filename. Type <tt  >blog.py</tt> and press Enter. (Python modules should have the
extension .py.) Now, you can start typing the Post class we
programmed before. Emacs tries to be smart about indentation and places
it
where you are likely to want it. If you need a different indentation,
simply press Tab and keep pressing it until you get the desired results.
</p><p>
On the top, you should have two menus: IM-Python and Python. The first
one contains a list of classes and methods in the file you are
editing. Click on Rescan if it doesn't show information you
know is there. This is very useful when working with huge files. The
second menu is even more useful, but explore and play with
it later. For now, simply run <tt  >Start interpreter...</tt>
or press Ctrl-C !.
</p><p>
Suddenly the window is split, and you have an embedded Python
interpreter below the file you are editing (Figure 2). And the fun
is only beginning. Click on the file you are editing to set the focus
on it. Run Import/reload file from the Python menu or
press Ctrl-C Enter. Now, you're ready
to test your code on the REPL, but be aware that you'll have to add
<tt  >blog.</tt> before the name of the class,
<tt  >Post</tt>, because now the
class is in the module blog. See Figure 2 for further reference.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9277f2.large.jpg"><img src="9277f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Testing the REPL
</p></div></div><p>
You can, of course, do the same without Emacs. But for that, you need
to learn how Python modules and packages are made. Set PYTHON_PATH,
an environment variable, accordingly, and use the built-in function
reload. With Emacs, you'll find iterating between coding
and testing the code to be very fast. This speed can improve your performance and
make programming more fun. In fact, Lisp programmers have been advocating
this way of working for more than two decades.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17de580.0x18d00c8"></a>
Special Methods</h2></div></div><p>
Having to create an object and then set each of its members is not
pleasant. It takes a lot of lines and is very error-prone&mdash;did I
remember to set the tags? There's a better way to do it&mdash;using the initialization
method.
</p><p>
 
This special method is called __init__, and the parameters you
define it to take have to be passed in the creation of the object. A
possible initialization method would be:

<pre     class="programlisting">
class Post(object):
    def __init__(self, title, body):
        self.set_title(title)
        self.set_body(body)
</pre>
</p><p>
Simply add the __init__ definition to the file and reload it. We
now can, and have to, set the title and body at initialization time:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; cool = blog.Post("Cool", "Python is cool")
&gt;&gt;&gt; cool.get_title()
'Cool'
&gt;&gt;&gt; cool.get_body()
'Python is cool'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</pre>
</p><p>
Hint: to retrieve previous lines in the REPL inside Emacs use 
Alt-P.
</p><p>
There are other special methods. Remember how ugly it was to evaluate
a Post itself? Let me remind you:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&gt;&gt;&gt; cool
&lt;blog.Post object at 0xb7c7e9ac&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>

We can solve that. There's another special method called __repr__,
which is used to retrieve that string. Inside the Post class add:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def __repr__(self):
    return "Blog Post: %s" % self.get_title()

Reload the file, the same way you loaded it previously, and evaluate
a post:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&gt;&gt;&gt; ## working on region in file /usr/tmp/python...
&gt;&gt;&gt; cool
&lt;blog.Post object at 0xb7c7e9ac&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 

</pre>
</p><p>
Oops! That's not what we wanted. The problem here is that the
cool object was created with an older version of the
Post class, so it doesn't have the new method. That is a
very common mistake, and not being prepared for it can cause a lot of
headaches. But, simply re-create the object, and you are set:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; ## working on region in file /usr/tmp/python...
&gt;&gt;&gt; cool = blog.Post("Cool", "Python is cool")
&gt;&gt;&gt; cool
Blog Post: Cool
&gt;&gt;&gt;

want something to do now, start learning Emacs.
