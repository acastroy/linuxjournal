Which database is right for you? MySQL or PostgreSQL? 
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2410580.0x25082f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you are an application developer, you're probably working with
large quantities of data. And, if that data is anything more complex
than a hash table, you might want to consider moving some or all
of it into a relational database. Relational databases are designed
for reliable and flexible retrieval of data. The magic of a
relational database is not the use of two-dimensional tables to store
all of the information, but it's the fact that tables can be combined in
many different ways and manipulated using the SQL query language.
</p><p>
As we saw in my database articles in the last two issues of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, open-source programmers are
fortunate enough to have several database options at their disposal.
By far, the two most popular open-source relational databases are
MySQL and PostgreSQL. Each has a large and loyal following, and each
continues to improve with every successive version.
</p><p>
And, when I write &ldquo;large and loyal following&rdquo; above, I'm not
kidding. MySQL and PostgreSQL have long been at the center of a major flame war
within the Open Source world. If someone on Slashdot dares say
something about one of these products, you can be sure it won't
be long before someone writes a nasty (and often childish) note about
the other one. These disagreements often reflect the knee-jerk
attitudes of uninformed users, but there have been no shortage of
attacks from well-known and informed users of these products as well.
</p><p>
I believe there are circumstances when either
MySQL or PostgreSQL might be an appropriate choice. I've strongly
preferred PostgreSQL in my work during the last decade&mdash;yet, there
definitely are times when MySQL seems to be the more appropriate
solution.
</p><p>
So, despite my personal biases and the risk of opening a flame war
within the Open Source community, I now conclude this series about
open-source databases with a comparison between MySQL and PostgreSQL
in a number of different categories. I hope by the time you
finish reading this article, you understand that choosing a database
is almost never a matter of finding the &ldquo;fastest&rdquo; or
&ldquo;best&rdquo; product,
because there is no one way to measure the quality or appropriateness
of a relational database server. Rather, I hope you'll be able
to consider each of these on the basis of its own merits, rather than on the
propaganda that is so widespread.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2410580.0x2508768"></a>
Data Integrity</h2></div></div><p>
Perhaps the first and foremost task of a database is to store and
retrieve data reliably. Just as you wouldn't want to use a hard disk
that occasionally loses data, you don't want to put things into a
database that occasionally mangles its contents. This is true even if
the reliability comes at the expense of speed.
</p><p>
The gold standard for reliability in the database world has an
acronym, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and
Durability). This means that under all circumstances in the database,
the following hold true:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Atomicity: each query is guaranteed to complete or not,
without any possibility of halfway or incomplete states.
</p></li><li><p>
Consistency: the database is always in a legal state before
and after a transaction.
</p></li><li><p>
Isolation: each transaction occurs separately from other
actions, so that you can't have two transactions interfering
with one another.
</p></li><li><p>
Durability: transactions persist over time, typically by being
stored on a filesystem.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The attitude toward ACID within the PostgreSQL community has been
unchanged since I first started to use it a decade ago, placing it as
the highest possible priority. This doesn't mean PostgreSQL is
lacking in other features, but rather it means the developers have worked
to ensure that data stored in a PostgreSQL system will be consistent
and reliable, even if you do nasty things such as issue a <tt  >kill
-9</tt> or
pull the plug.
</p><p>
During the past few years, PostgreSQL has begun to offer even better
support for transactions and database stability, using write-ahead
logs (WALs) that describe each action taken by the database. These WAL
files can be used to recover from a disaster or even to recover the
database to an earlier point in its history&mdash;a feature known as
point-in-time recovery (PITR). Thus, if you know something
happened yesterday, but the database was working perfectly two
days ago, you could use PITR to recover to the earlier, stable state.
Recent versions of PostgreSQL also support two-phased commit, a type
of transaction you're likely to see in a distributed system where
multiple servers must coordinate their actions.
</p><p>
MySQL has had a mixed attitude toward ACID during the years. When I
first started to use MySQL in 1995, the authors' attitude was that
transactions should be handled by the application, not the database.
Indeed, as recently as 2000, the to-do list for MySQL included tasks
having to do with production-quality transaction-safe tables. This
has led to a great deal of bad blood between the MySQL and PostgreSQL
communities, with members of the latter sometimes claiming that no
critical data should ever be stored in MySQL.
</p><p>
The good news is that modern versions of MySQL do indeed support
transaction-safe tables, using InnoDB, a third-party product released
under the GPL that has been integrated into MySQL for several years.
Moreover, InnoDB appears to use techniques that PostgreSQL and Oracle
have used for years, such as MVCC (multi-version concurrency control).
The bad news is that at least some benchmarks I've seen indicate that
InnoDB has some problems scaling to large numbers of simultaneous
queries.
</p><p>
In addition, the company that develops InnoDB recently was bought by
Oracle, which might lead some people to worry about future licensing,
development and pricing issues. For the time being, this latter
issue does not appear to be a serious one, because Oracle and MySQL
signed a contract in 2006 extending the licensing for InnoDB. But,
MySQL does not appear to be taking any chances and has hired several
experts to create a new table structure that will be owned by MySQL
and thus be impervious to such business problems.
</p><p>
I'm personally of the persuasion that true ACID compliance is always a
good thing to have around, much like seat belts in a car. Sure, you
can drive without a seat belt, and the odds are that nothing will
happen to you. But, it's impossible to predict when something bad
might happen, and you really don't want to be without a seat belt
under such circumstances. In the same way, if your data is important
to you, it's best to ensure that it will persist with integrity.
</p><p>
A related problem has to do with the degree to which each database
enforces constraints and limits. PostgreSQL tends to be quite
stringent on such matters, refusing to accept illegal data. MySQL
tries to be more forgiving and flexible, but that can result in
strange and illegal data being stored.
</p><p>
For example, consider the following set of MySQL commands, in which we
create a table foo with a single column (named a) of type DATE:


<pre     class="programlisting">
mysql&gt; CREATE TABLE foo (a date);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.08 sec)

mysql&gt; INSERT INTO foo (a) VALUES ('2007-feb-30');
Query OK, 1 row affected, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

mysql&gt; SELECT * FROM foo;
+------------+
| a          |
+------------+
| 0000-00-00 |
+------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
</pre>
</p><p>
By contrast, this is what happens in PostgreSQL:

<pre     class="programlisting">
atf=# CREATE TABLE foo (a date);
CREATE TABLE

atf=# \d foo
Table "public.foo"
 Column | Type | Modifiers
--------+------+-----------
 a      | date |

atf=# INSERT INTO foo (a) VALUES ('2007-feb-30');
ERROR:  date/time field value out of range: "2007-feb-30"
</pre>
</p><p>
It is possible to configure MySQL to be more strict on such issues, but
most users will not think to do so and will be stuck with
illegal values in their tables.
</p><p>
Given the political and technical issues at MySQL, as well as the
weird (and potentially dangerous) default behavior in MySQL, I believe
that PostgreSQL has a big edge on issues of data integrity.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2410580.0x2509160"></a>
Features</h2></div></div><p>
MySQL and PostgreSQL offer a very large number of built-in features,
many of which have been added in response to community requests and
reactions. Both offer a large number of data types, which can be
mixed and matched within a single row without restrictions. (The very
limiting row-length restriction that plagued versions of PostgreSQL is
now ancient history, I'm happy to say.) Both databases now support
Unicode characters; MySQL supports both UCS-2 and UTF-8 encoding,
and PostgreSQL supports only the latter.
</p><p>
Both databases also offer a very large number of functions that
manipulate data, including strings and dates. It's quite convenient
to be able to compare and sort dates or to find all rows whose
timestamp was within the last 24 hours. PostgreSQL's interval data
type, which describes a length of time (rather than a particular point
in time), has proven to be particularly useful. MySQL has a number of
different types that database purists like myself frown upon, such as
SET and ENUM, but that are undoubtedly popular for many users.
</p><p>
In many areas where PostgreSQL has had an advantage, MySQL is
beginning to catch up. PostgreSQL users have long been able to create
new data types and functions that operate on those types. Indeed,
PostgreSQL offers developers the unusual ability to write server-side
functions in a number of languages, including SQL, Perl, Python, Java,
Tcl and the R statistical language. MySQL does not allow for the
creation of new data types, but recent versions do provide the ability
to write server-side functions and stored procedures.
</p><p>
MySQL has offered a built-in solution for full-text search,
accomplished by using a special type of index on text fields.
However, there are some important restrictions on this index, such as
the fact that it works only with MyISAM tables. Given that these
tables support neither foreign keys nor transactions, I am a bit
nervous about suggesting them as a solution.
</p><p>
PostgreSQL's full-text search solution (tsearch2) has the opposite
problem. Although it is robust and works well within PostgreSQL's
standard transactional tables, it requires some work to configure and
install. Most administrators and programmers will be able to install
it successfully within a short period of time, but nonetheless,
there is a difference between a built-in capability and one that
needs to be added.
</p><p>
PostgreSQL has a number of built-in features that MySQL either has yet
to implement or that are scheduled for future releases. Among these
are the ability to use subselects anywhere in a query, the use of
sequences (rather than simple auto-increment columns), rules that
allow users to modify the way queries are interpreted on a given
table and CHECK constraints on column values. Recent versions of
MySQL now include features that were previously available only in
PostgreSQL, such as triggers and views.
</p><p>
In general, the PostgreSQL development group seems to emphasize SQL
standards more than MySQL does, although the MySQL developers appear
to be increasingly sensitive to this need and now offer an --ansi
command-line switch for those people who want to work in a
standards-compatible mode all of the time.
</p><p>
Both MySQL and PostgreSQL are extremely easy to use. Each comes with
a command-line client program that is packed with features, allowing
you to manipulate your database by sending SQL queries. I have become
spoiled by some of the features of the PostgreSQL command line, such
as the expanded output (\x).
</p><p>
The command-line interfaces for both databases have grown more useful
over time. Although the MySQL interface might appear to have fewer
commands, that's partly because MySQL has made some data available via
SQL queries (for example, SHOW TABLES), which would require more complicated
queries in PostgreSQL, leading to the creation of a shorthand
command, \dt. Both command-line interfaces use GNU readline, making
it easy to edit and re-issue queries. Both also allow users to edit
the previous query using the \e command.
</p><p>
Overall, it's probably fair to say that PostgreSQL offers a superset
of MySQL's capabilities, aside from a few issues (for example, built-in text
indexing). Those capabilities that PostgreSQL does not have, such as new
data types and functions, are added into the system easily, without
needing to recompile or otherwise modify the core PostgreSQL server.
That said, I believe MySQL's capabilities are nothing to sneeze
at and are likely more than adequate for most applications you might
be writing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2410580.0x25095d8"></a>
Administration</h2></div></div><p>
Both MySQL and PostgreSQL are amazingly easy to administer, especially
in small- and medium-size cases. You (optionally) change a few
configuration options, start the server and then walk away. There's
really not much more to do than that. For anyone who has worked with
a larger database system, such as Oracle, this is a refreshing change.
However, there are slight differences in the ways the
two systems operate.
</p><p>
PostgreSQL relies on several external UNIX-level commands to create
and manage databases and users, as well as the activity of the
PostgreSQL server. There is no central PostgreSQL administrative
program. MySQL, by contrast, has a central mysqladmin program that
handles most functions having to do with server startup and shutdown,
as well as the creation and destruction of databases. The creation
and management of users is handled by manipulating tables in the
mysql database.
</p><p>
PostgreSQL's counterparts to the mysql database are special system tables
and views, all of which begin with the pg_ prefix. These tables,
although necessary for the system to run, easily can be ignored by most
programmers and come into play only when trying to tune the system or
figure out how to optimize queries.
</p><p>
GUI-based administration tools are available for both programs, as well as
Web-based tools written in PHP. To be honest, I haven't used these
tools much during the years, given my familiarity with (and preference
for) command-line systems for working with databases. However, my
experience with both sets of GUI programs has been positive, and my
impression is that they are both stable and secure, as well as useful.
</p><p>
Another aspect of administration unique to PostgreSQL is the
need to &ldquo;vacuum&rdquo; dead rows from the database to return them to the
operating system or to other rows that could benefit from the space.
In addition, PostgreSQL's vacuum function visits the rows of the dead
and uses the statistics it collects to inform the optimizer and
query planner. Nowadays, the auto-vacuum d&aelig;mon takes care of this
automatically for most people, removing the long-dreaded need to
schedule it in cron.
</p><p>
One administrative area that is particularly hot right now is
replication. Many Web sites and other applications are pushing the
limits of their database servers, and it would be useful to split the
work among multiple servers. Of course, this raises issues of data
integrity and synchronization among distributed processes. The simple
solution to the problem is to have a master/slave relationship among
the different servers, with UPDATEs and INSERTs taking place only
on the master server, and SELECTs taking place on the slave servers.
Solutions for this exist under both MySQL and PostgreSQL, although the
PostgreSQL solution (Slony) is external to the standard package and
apparently can be difficult to install and configure.
</p><p>
A more complicated setup involves the use of two master database
servers. MySQL appears to have taken the lead on this front with a
relatively new clustering tool. But, PostgreSQL users, who have been
clamoring for such tools for several years now, appear to be on the
verge of getting their wishes fulfilled.
</p><p>
Finally, no database server would be worthwhile if it weren't possible
to perform regular backups. pg_dump and mysqldump are command-line
programs that turn the current contents of a database into a text
file. Such dump files are quite useful and can be used to rebuild the
database when necessary.
</p><p>
I would argue that when it comes to administration, the two database
products are identical&mdash;unless you need replication, in which case you'll
probably benefit from MySQL's greater experience and replication
integration.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2410580.0x2509a50"></a>
Performance</h2></div></div><p>
For years, one of the claims made in the MySQL/PostgreSQL flame war
has had to do with speed. MySQL fans often have claimed that their
system is faster, particularly for read-only tasks, making it a
superior choice for Web sites where most data is read. PostgreSQL
advocates, in contrast, claim that their system holds up to big loads
much better than MySQL.
</p><p>
I haven't conducted any benchmarks of my own, but my reluctance to
do so is an admission that I'm unqualified to create a
good benchmark, and not that I believe the two systems are identical or
that performance isn't important. Moreover, as I stated previously, I
believe that performance is secondary to data integrity. I would much
rather have a slow, reliable database than a fast one that 
occasionally will wreak havoc on my data.
</p><p>
From the benchmarks I've seen, it appears that MySQL is
indeed faster than PostgreSQL when working with a small number of
clients or with read-only data. However, all of the comparisons 
I've seen over the last few years indicate that as more clients are
added to the system, PostgreSQL handles the load better.
</p><p>
Does this mean that PostgreSQL always will be faster? Of course not.
But, it does mean that on particularly popular sites, PostgreSQL may
hold up better.
</p><p>
Maybe I'm simply naive, but I decided several years ago that I would
largely ignore the performance debate when it came to databases. Both
MySQL and PostgreSQL have large followings and have been used on
large-scale systems. The data seems to indicate that PostgreSQL
has an advantage, but enough people are using MySQL on large Web
sites that I have to assume it is working well enough for them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2410580.0x2509cb8"></a>
Support</h2></div></div><p>
Finally, no comparison would be complete without mentioning support.
We might consider several types of support&mdash;from the
strength of the Open Source community to the number and quality of
companies supporting (and developing) the software to the number of
third-party applications that support each database.
</p><p>
It is impossible to ignore the extremely large number of MySQL users
in the world. This has led to an outpouring of books, tutorials and
mailing lists for MySQL&mdash;some (but not all) of which have been
sponsored by the MySQL company itself. If the community-based support
is not enough, it is possible to buy commercial support for MySQL
from a number of companies, including MySQL AB.
</p><p>
PostgreSQL has a smaller community, and a smaller number of books and
tutorials available. However, my experience has been that the
community is responsive to questions and suggestions, and that the
lead developers often are quite willing to answer questions from all
levels of users.
</p><p>
Many open-source packages support both MySQL and PostgreSQL. But, it
is rare to find a package that supports PostgreSQL exclusively, and it
is easy to find packages that support MySQL alone. This has been a
source of some frustration for members of the PostgreSQL community;
however, there doesn't seem to be much anyone can do about it,
short of asking for patches or contributing such
patches.
</p><p>
A recent thread on the main PostgreSQL mailing list asked about CRM
packages that support the database. Although there were a few, there was
definitely some grumbling about the lack of PostgreSQL from other
open-source projects. Those projects often are staffed by small
groups of volunteers who rarely understand how they can
make their SQL more portable and thus easier to use on multiple
brands of databases.
</p><p>
The bottom line on support is that although PostgreSQL support is
excellent, MySQL support is overwhelming. If there is a winner here,
it's MySQL.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2410580.0x2500808"></a>
Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>
So, should you pick MySQL or PostgreSQL for your next database task?
All things being equal, I strongly recommend PostgreSQL. Its
community might be smaller, and there are fewer resources available
in print and on the Web. But, it has more features to ensure data
integrity, its features are largely a superset of MySQL, and it always
offers transactions and referential integrity, without having to
specify a particular type of table.
</p><p>
That said, there are reasons to use MySQL: if you already are using
it, if you need commercial or community support, if you need replication, or if you are using software
that is incompatible with PostgreSQL, MySQL is a fine choice.
Just make sure to use InnoDB tables, so that you can take advantage of
what a database always was meant to do&mdash;ensure the quality of
the data.
