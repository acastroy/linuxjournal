S2 Games (<a href="http://www.s2games.com" target="_self">www.s2games.com</a>) is the independent game company that made a
huge splash in the summer of 2003 with the release of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Savage: The Battle
for Newerth</em></span>.  It wasn't the graphics or the engine that particularly
made this game notable.  It was the merging of two distinct
genres&mdash;real-time strategy games, such as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Warcraft</em></span>, with first-person shooters, such as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span>&mdash;into what S2 Games calls a
&ldquo;real-time strategy shooter&rdquo;.  This is
not a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG), but instead
it is run like a team-based first-person shooter, where a group runs its
own server instance, and then all of the players join that instance.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe4a580.0xf426b8"></a>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Savage</em></span> Game Play</h2></div></div><p>
In some ways, it's easier to talk about the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Savage</em></span> games in
terms of other games with which you may be more familiar.  There is
a thorough breakdown of the game's general rhythm available at
<a href="http://savage2.s2games.com/gp_overview.php" target="_self">savage2.s2games.com/gp_overview.php</a>, so I won't repeat that
here.  First, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Savage</em></span> is nothing new with having two teams (the
humans versus the &ldquo;beasts&rdquo;) trying to destroy each other on a dedicated
server.  It's also not new to have the option of playing combat characters
or support characters.  For example, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tribes</em></span> allows you to take on the
role of a repair engineer to keep the equipment in repair.  However, in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tribes</em></span> and most other first-person shooter games, all of the characters
spawn as fairly identical units&mdash;it's the equipment that allows for
specialization.  Some, such as the Team Fortress mod for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span>, did allow
people to select a character class, such as engineer, that remains throughout
the game.
</p><p>
In the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Savage</em></span> games, one player takes on the role of the Commander,
and then there are three additional classes: builder/conjurer, scout/shape
shifter and savage/summoner.  (The name of your class depends on which
side you have taken in the battle.) Other first-person shooters that allow
creation of Commanders have used them only for strategic purposes, such as
coordinating the action players.  Building, however, is new to first-person
shooters, which brings in a feature from the real-time strategy side.
</p><p>
Another difference is that one phase of the game involves sending your
action players out to hunt NPCs for both experience and gold, much as you
would in an MMORPG.  Typically, there are no NPCs in such team-oriented
first-person shooter games.  While the players hunt, the Commander
researches technology and builds weapons, siege engines and more,
which is another real-time strategy and MMORPG-style feature.  Through
the remaining early phases of the game, things continue to work in a
real-time strategy mode as costs for building upkeep come into play.  So,
gold mines and more need to be owned and maintained to help keep
everything in good shape.
</p><p>
Although first-person shooters are almost entirely modern day or
science fiction, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Savage</em></span> games are held in a fantasy setting.  In
many team-oriented first-person shooters, to gain access to more
powerful equipment, groups often need to complete some kind of task,
such as capturing a certain number of flags or destroying something
valuable to the enemy, such as its generator.  In
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Savage</em></span> games,
you have to create possessed/Hellbourne pits in order to gain certain
powerful fighters.  Once this goal is achieved, along with some others,
the actual combat between the two teams commences.  Soon after this
point, the Commander switches from building and researching to tactical
command, directing the forces.  Both siege and battle units are important
for winning.  Perhaps the closest parallel to this type of play is the
Battlegrounds in <span   class="emphasis"><em>World of Warcraft</em></span>.
</p><p>
With this level of complexity, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Savage</em></span> games go
far beyond merely
&ldquo;shooting each other dead&rdquo;.

The Method behind the Madness</h2></div></div><p>
In the Linux world, S2 Games made another splash as well by offering
not only a server for Linux users, but also a native client.  At the
time, it seemed a no-brainer for the company, because its Silverback game
engine is written for OpenGL (<a href="http://www.opengl.org" target="_self">www.opengl.org</a>), the cross-platform graphics
standard typically used by those who want to develop for
more than one operating system simultaneously.  An advantage of hosting
its servers on
Linux is that the operating system has so much less overhead than Windows
that it is possible to host multiple server instances on the same Linux
machine without losing performance.  This is not the case with Windows.
</p><p>
The Linux community responded with enthusiasm, accounting for
approximately 15% (7,500 units) of the sales for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Savage: The Battle for
Newerth</em></span> according to Mark DeForest, lead designer and cofounder of S2
Games.  Due to the strong Linux community support and the fact that S2
Games' collective personalities find a kinship with some of the Linux
community's attitudes, when it came time to build <span   class="emphasis"><em>Savage 2: A Tortured
Soul</em></span>, the company wanted to continue providing a Linux client.  However,
the decision was made to use DirectX for the next engine, K2, because
DirectX is still easier for programmers to work with, and there is far
more middleware (software that game developers can purchase instead of
having to write every tiny piece themselves) available for DirectX than
for OpenGL.  DirectX is also easier to tie into Microsoft Windows
and the related APIs (programming interfaces allowing programs to talk
to one another).
</p><p>
Rather than abandoning Linux, S2 Games decided to go ahead and
make an OpenGL version of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Savage 2</em></span> as well.  As S2
Games wanted to make a
lower-end renderer for those who have older video cards, the company folded this
functionality into the OpenGL engine as well.  Doing so means that both
Linux and Windows users have the option of playing in both high-end and
low-end graphics settings, keeping those with lower-end hardware able to
play the game.  Ultimately, including support for Linux adds more expense,
frustration in terms of getting things working, project management
and support efforts and costs, which makes the fact that none of the S2
Games staff are actually Linux users particularly interesting.
</p><p>
If <span   class="emphasis"><em>Savage 1</em></span> broke ground and created a new genre,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Savage 2</em></span> refines
it.  DeForest says that the game-play mechanics will not change.  There
will be new role-playing game (RPG) elements added, but otherwise, most
differences are going to be a matter of polish.  <span   class="emphasis"><em>Savage
2</em></span> will simply
&ldquo;look and feel better&rdquo;, as the company takes the game to the next level.  For
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Savage 1</em></span>, S2 Games didn't have time to polish the
product fully.  This time,
the developers promised themselves that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Savage 2</em></span>
truly would be a step above,
rather than resting on their laurels, as no one else has seriously
entered the genre they created.  If you look at the pictures from both
games, you will see just how far they have come (see Figures 1 and 2 to
compare).  Many more images are available on the S2 Games site.

Beta testing for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Savage 2: A Tortured Soul</em></span> begins
July 31, 2006 for both
Windows and Linux, and the game is scheduled for release in November
2006, as of this writing.  This
game is available for pre-order on-line, for those who are interested,
and the Linux client launches at the same time as the Windows client.
