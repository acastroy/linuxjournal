How to use backtrace and a custom library to debug your embedded
applications.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd7a580.0xe722f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Embedded Linux does a good job of bridging the gap between embedded
programming and high-level UNIX programming.  It has a full TCP stack,
good debugging tools and great library support.  This makes for a
feature-rich development environment.  There is one downside, however.
How can you debug problems that occur out in the field?
</p><p>
On full-featured operating systems, it's easy to use a core dump to
debug a problem that occurs in the field.
</p><p>
On non-embedded UNIX systems, when a program encounters an exception, it
outputs all of its current state to a file on the filesystem.  This file
is usually called core.  This core file contains all the memory
the program was using at the time the failure occurred.  This allows
for post-mortem investigation to diagnose the exception.
</p><p>
Typically, on embedded Linux systems, there is no (or very little)
persistent disk storage.  On all of the systems on which I have worked,
there is more RAM than persistent storage.  So, getting a core dump
is impossible.  This article describes some alternatives to core dumps
that will allow you to perform post-mortem debugging.
</p><p>
Programs can fail for reasons other than exceptions.  Programs can
deadlock, or they can have run-away threads that use up all system
resources (memory, CPU or other fixed resources).  It also would be
beneficial to generate some kind of persistent crash file under these
situations.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd7a580.0xe72558"></a>
Requirements</h2></div></div><p>
So, first we need to come up with the information we want to
save.  Because of memory constraints, saving all of the process' memory
is not an option.  If it were, you simply could use core dumps! But,
there is other very useful information we can save.  At the top of
the list is the backtrace of the failed thread.
</p><p>
A backtrace is a list of the functions that were called to get to the
current position in the program.  Even with the absence of system memory
and data, a backtrace can shed light onto what was happening at the time
of failure.
</p><p>
Many embedded systems also have logs: lists of errors, warnings and
metrics to let you know what happened.  Having a post-mortem dump
of the last few logs before failure is an invaluable asset in finding
the root cause of a failure.
</p><p>
In complex, multithreaded systems, you usually have many mutexes.
It could be useful, in the case of a deadlock, to show the state of all
the processes' mutexes and semaphores.
</p><p>
Showing memory usage statistics also could help diagnose the problem.
</p><p>
Once we have determined the information we want to save, we still
need to come up with where to save it.  This will vary greatly from
system to system.  If your system has no persistent storage at all,
perhaps you can output the crash information to a serial terminal or
display it on an LCD readout.  (We have serious space constraints there!)
If your system has CompactFlash, you can save it to a filesystem.
Or, if it has raw Flash (an MTD device), you can either save it to
a jffs2 filesystem, or maybe to a raw sector or two.
</p><p>
If the crash was not too severe, perhaps the crash could be uploaded
to a tftp server or sent to a remote syslog facility.
</p><p>
Now that we have a firm grasp on what we want to save, and locations to
which we can
save it, let's talk about how we are going to do it!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd7a580.0xe728c8"></a>
The Backtrace</h2></div></div><p>
In general, getting a backtrace is not as simple as it sounds.  Accessing
system registers (like the stack pointer) varies from architecture to
architecture.  Thankfully, the FSF comes to our
rescue in GNU's C Standard Library (see the on-line Resources).  Libc has
three functions that will aid us in retrieving backtraces: backtrace(),
backtrace_symbols() and backtrace_symbols_fd().
</p><p>
The backtrace() function populates an array of pointers with a backtrace
of the current thread.  This, in general, is enough information for
debugging, but it is not very pretty.
</p><p>
The backtrace_symbols() function takes the information populated by
backtrace() and returns symbolic names (function names).  The only
problem with backtrace_symbols is that it is not async-signal safe.
backtrace_symbols() uses malloc().  Because malloc() uses spinlocks, it is
not safe to be called from a signal handler (it could cause a deadlock).
</p><p>
The backtrace_symbols_fd() function attempts to solve the signal issues
associated with malloc and output the symbolic information directly to
a file descriptor.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd7a580.0xe72ad8"></a>
Working inside of a Signal Handler</h2></div></div><p>
Some functions inside of libc rely on signals themselves: some IO
operations, memory allocation and so on.  So, we are very limited in
what we should do inside of a handler.  In our case, we can cheat
a little.  Because our program already is crashing, a deadlock is not
<span   class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> big of a concern.  The code in my examples
makes use of several not-allowed functions, such as fwrite(), printf()
and sprintf().
But, we can work to avoid some of the functions that are prone to
deadlock, such as malloc() and backtrace_symbols().
</p><p>
In my opinion, the biggest loss we have is the loss of
backtrace_symbols.  But, here is where things get easier.  You always
can implement your own symbol table and look up the functions from the
pointers themselves.
</p><p>
In my examples, I sometimes use backtrace_symbols().  I have not
seen a deadlock yet, but it <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> possible.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd7a580.0xe72d40"></a>
A Simple Backtrace Handler</h2></div></div><p>
So, what does the crash handler look like? To get a backtrace, the first
thing we need to do is grab our signals.  Some of the common ones are
SIGSEGV, SIGILL and SIGBUS.  Additionally, abort() is usually called
in the case of an assertion and generates a SIGABRT.
</p><p>
Then, when a signal occurs, we need to save our backtrace.  The following
snippet details a simple backtrace function that displays the backtrace
to standard output when a crash happens:


<pre     class="programlisting">

void signal_handler(int signo)
    {
       void *stack[20];
    int count, i;

    // Shouldn't use printf . . . oh well
    printf("Caught signal %d\n");

    count = backtrace(stack, 20);
        for (i=0; i &lt; count; i++) {
      printf("Frame %2d: %p\n", i+1, stack[i]);
    }
}
int main(...)
{
  ...
  signal(SIGBUS, signal_handler);
  signal(SIGILL, signal_handler);
  signal(SIGSEGV, signal_handler);
  signal(SIGABRT, signal_handler);
}

Caught signal 11
Frame  1:  0x401a84
Frame  2:  0x401d88
...

</pre>
</p><p>
And, here is a similar signal handler, but one that uses backtrace_symbols
to print out a prettier backtrace:


<pre     class="programlisting">

void signal_handler(int signo)
    {
       void *stack[20];
           char **functions;

    int count, i;

    // Shouldn't use printf . . . oh well
    printf("Caught signal %d\n");

    count = backtrace(stack, 20);
            functions = backtrace_symbols(stack, count);
         for (i=0; i &lt; count; i++) {
      printf("Frame %2d: %s\n", i, functions[i]);
    }
            free(functions);
}

Caught signal 11
Frame  1:  ./a.out [0x401a84]
Frame  2:  ./a.out [0x401bfa]
...

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd7a580.0xe72fa8"></a>
eCrash&mdash;A Generic Crash Handler</h2></div></div><p>
As I was writing this article, I realized that this was about the fifth
time I had written a crash handler.  (Why can't all software be open
source?) So, I decided to write a quick library to handle crash dumps and
provide it for this article.  I liked the little library I started with,
but I found myself needing more and more features.  As I kept extending
it, I realized that it was a <span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> useful library,
that I wanted to be able to leverage on any future project!
</p><p>
I named the new library eCrash and created a SourceForge site for it
(see Resources).  Since then, I have been extending it, and it now supports
dumping multiple threads&mdash;using only backtrace, using backtrace and
backtrace_symbols, and using backtrace with a user-supplied symbol
table to avoid the malloc() inside of backtrace_symbols.  The rest of
the examples in this article are going to be leveraging eCrash.
</p><p>
eCrash is relatively simple to use.  You first call eCrash_Init() from
your parent thread.  If you have a single-threaded program, you are
already finished.  A backtrace will be delivered based on your settings
in the parameters structure.
</p><p>
If you have a multithreaded program, any thread that wants to be
backtraced in a crash (other than the crashing thread) must also call
eCrash_RegisterThread().  It is sometimes useful to dump the stacks of
all threads when a crash occurs, not only the crashing thread's stack.
</p><p>
With eCrash, you specify where the output should go by setting file
descriptors (async safe writes), FILE * streams (not async safe), and/or
a filename of the file to output when a crash occurs.  eCrash will write
to <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> destinations supplied.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd7a580.0xe732c0"></a>
eCrash&mdash;Gathering Stacks from Other Threads</h2></div></div><p>
Obtaining the stack from a thread that did <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
crash is a bit trickier.  When a thread registers, it specifies a signal
that the thread does not catch or block.  eCrash registers a handler
for that signal (called the Backtrace Signal).
</p><p>
When eCrash needs to dump a thread (when some other thread has
caused an exception), it sends the thread the Backtrace Signal via
pthread_kill().  When that signal is caught, the thread saves its backtrace
to a global area and continues on.  The main exception handler can then
read the stack and display it.
</p><p>
What we end up with is a very nice-looking crash dump, showing exactly
what was happening in the system when the failure occurred.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd7a580.0xe734d0"></a>
eCrash&mdash;A Real-World Example</h2></div></div><p>
Enough talking&mdash;time for some meat.  Now, let's take what we have
discussed and put it to work.  We are going to use the ecrash_test
program included in eCrash.  That program was designed to break in any
one of its threads (generate a segmentation violation by attempting to
write to a NULL pointer).
</p><p>
We execute the test program with the following flags:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ecrash_test --num_threads=5 --thread_to_crash=3
</pre>
</p><p>
This causes the test program to generate five threads.  All but
thread number 3 will call a few functions, then go to sleep.  Thread 3
will call a few functions (to make the backtrace interesting) and crash.
</p><p>
The crash file generated is shown in Listing 1 and
backtrace_symbols() in Listing 2.  Due to space constraints, all listings for this article are
available on the <i  >Linux Journal</i> FTP site (<a href="../listings/149/8724.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue149/8724.tgz</a>).
</p><p>
The crash file has the backtrace of our offending thread (the one that
caused the segmentation violation) and the backtraces of all threads
on the system.
</p><p>
Now it's time to debug the crash.  We will debug this as if the crash
happened at a remote site and the system administrator e-mailed you
this crash file.
</p><p>
One last thing: in the real world, the executables always are stripped
of debugging information.  But, that is okay.  As long as you keep a copy
of the program <span   class="emphasis"><em>with</em></span> its debugging information,
you can ship a stripped copy of the code, and everything will still work!
</p><p>
So, in the lab, you have your crash file and your program with debugging
information.  Run <tt  >gdb</tt> on the debug version of your program.  We know
that we have a segmentation violation.  So, starting from frame zero of
the offending thread, start listing the code as shown Listing 3 (see the
<i  >LJ</i> FTP site).
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Frame 0 is inside of our crash handler&mdash;nothing to see here.
</p></li><li><p>
Frame 1 is also inside of the crash handler.
</p></li><li><p>
Frame 2 is still inside of our crash handler.
</p></li><li><p>
Frame 3 shows no source file (it is inside of libc).
</p></li><li><p>
Frame 4 shows the actual crash (inside of crashC).
</p></li><li><p>
Frame 5 shows crashB.
</p></li><li><p>
Frame 6 shows crashA.
</p></li><li><p>
Frame 7 shows ecrash_test_thread.
</p></li><li><p>
And, frames 8 and 9 are where the thread gets created in libc.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
As you can see, there is a trick to displaying function pointers with
gdb.  Simply give it an address and dereference it in a list:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(gdb) list *0xWHATEVER
</pre>
</p><p>
This also works with symbolic_names and offsets:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(gdb) list *main+100
</pre>
</p><p>
Okay, that was our crashed thread, but what about one of the
sleepers? Examine the backtrace from Thread 5, Listing 4 (see the
<i  >LJ</i> FTP site):
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Frame 0 is inside of our backtrace handler.
</p></li><li><p>
Frame 1 still inside of the handler.
</p></li><li><p>
Frame 2 is in libc.
</p></li><li><p>
Frame 3 is in libc.
</p></li><li><p>
Frame 4 is in libc.
</p></li><li><p>
Frame 5 is inside of sleepFuncC&mdash;it is showing the for statement as
the program counter, because we are outside of the sleep()
function.  This is notable because the async signal sent to tell the
thread to dump its stack caused sleep() to exit prematurely.
</p></li><li><p>
Frame 6 shows sleepFuncB.
</p></li><li><p>
Frame 7 shows sleepFuncA.
</p></li><li><p>
Frame 8 shows crash_test_thread.
</p></li><li><p>
Frame 9 is where the thread gets created in libc (or libpthread).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
So, this thread is one of the sleeping threads.  Not much to see, but
in some cases, this thread's information could be vital to discovering
the cause of a crash.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd7a580.0x126ccc8"></a>
Other Useful Crash Information</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we have clobbered to death what a backtrace is, how to produce
one, the different methods of displaying one and how to debug a crash
with one, it's time to change gears.
A crash file can include a lot more information:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
States of mutexes (who is holding the locks&mdash;useful for deadlock
diagnosis).
</p></li><li><p>
Current error logs.
</p></li><li><p>
Program statistics.
</p></li><li><p>
Memory usage.
</p></li><li><p>
Most recent network packets.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Some of the above items could be useful information for post-mortem
debugging.  There is one caveat, however.  Because we have encountered an
exception, something has gone terribly wrong.  Our data structures could
be corrupt.  We could be low on (or out of) memory.
</p><p>
Also, some threads could be deadlocked waiting on mutexes that our
crashed thread was holding.
</p><p>
Because some of the data we want to display might generate another exception
(if it is corrupted), we want to display the most important information
first, then display more and more unsafe information.  Also, to prevent
information loss, buffers always should be flushed on FILE* streams.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd7a580.0x126d2a0"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Diagnosing a problem on a deployed embedded system can be a difficult
task.  But, choosing the right data to save or display in the case of
an exception can make the task much easier.
</p><p>
With a relatively small amount of storage, or a remote server, you can
save enough post-mortem information to be able to find a failure in
your system.
