Xoops! Not a Security Hole</h4><p>
In response to Cameron Spitzer's letter [June 2006, &ldquo;Xoops! A Security
Hole&rdquo;], Juan Marcelo Rodriguez may have forgotten to mention that Xoops
needs the permissions of the uploads, cache and templates_c directories
set to 777 just for the install.  You can change them back! When you
log in to the application for the first time, if they are still set to
777, the application will ask you to change them.

Trolling for Ranting Ranters</h4><p>
I like how the magazine has changed.  I think it's exciting.  It's like
watching it grow (literally, too).  The design upgrade brings it closer
to the style of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Network Computing</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>IT
Architect</em></span> or other glossy CMP
periodicals I also read, and nicely not so &ldquo;pagemaker crayola&rdquo;
as <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span>
looks.  I think this look reaches out to those who would flip thru the
magazine rack and pick up a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span> or <span   class="emphasis"><em>PC
Gamer</em></span>.  That must have provoked an
argument or two, because that's also an editorial and policy change for the
whole magazine.  It hasn't lost the hard tech edge, though.  If I ever want
to read about how to write a device driver, I don't have to look very far.
</p><p>
Boy, this has been fun reading the Letters column.  Look at all the people
getting riled up about Nick's trolls! I thought I saw Nick sitting under
a big bridge somewhere, waiting to point out the obvious with his thick
finger, just to watch all the readers squirm.  I think it's brilliant! (Who
among us has not enjoyed reading through a trolling thread on Slashdot?) This
makes the magazine <span   class="emphasis"><em>not boring</em></span>, and that will keep plenty of us around.
</p><p>
Mod me down for my casual comments but don't unsubscribe me.  I think
it's important that Nick point out the obvious issues in the Linux
community.  It's like big group therapy.  &ldquo;Uncle Nick&rdquo; is going to make
fun of distros that are lagging behind! Of course he appreciates how
hard they all work, that's given.  But he really doesn't want any distro
to lag behind, because that doesn't do service to Linux as a whole.
</p><p>
Maybe if &ldquo;Uncle Nick&rdquo; points out some of these obvious things, we'll
wake up and help out.  Or maybe we'll listen to our own trolls and hear
ourselves.  When <i  >Linux Journal</i> had the &ldquo;nekkid
piano player&rdquo; cover, the Letters
column was filled with the laments from the stuffed-shirts&mdash;that was
fun! I see more of that, but now it's even more cogent to the discussion:
by pointing out these obvious things in an opinionated way, he's poking
us in the ribs to at least join in the conversation! (And maybe we'll
become involved.)

Simple Is Good</h4><p>
The &ldquo;Google Maps&rdquo; installment of Reuven Lerner's At the Forge
column [June 2006] was simple
enough to get lots of noobs excited&mdash;that's great! However, creating
dynamically named variables like myMarker$count is bad style that I'd
rather keep away from the kids.  JavaScript has locally scoped variables,
so there's no need for that kind of 1970s hackery.

Change Is Good Too</h4><p>
I can't even make it off page 10 of the July 2006 issue that I just got
today.  For the last several months, I have read for the most part how
&ldquo;concerned&rdquo; or &ldquo;upset&rdquo; people are for the changes
in <i  >LJ</i>.  And how they
are going to quit subscribing to the magazine, unless things are turned back
around again soon.  Why is it that people are so afraid of change? Change
is good folks, really, it is!
</p><p>
Anyways, I love the new dimensions of the magazine.  I really enjoy
the /etc/rants too.  I find a good chuckle in them, and they're informative too.  I
also like the in-depth coverage, even though some readers may feel that
it's a waste.  I am sure that there are other readers that feel the same
as I do.  Kudos to <i  >LJ</i> for making it fun to
read again and get
the feeling of a child again, waiting for Christmas day to come, when
the new magazine is supposed to be coming in the mail any day now.

Causes and Effects</h4><p>
In response to Doc Searls' &ldquo;Causes and Effects&rdquo; article [July
2006], I just wanted to
say thanks.  I really enjoy reading articles like this.  Being a supporter
of Net Neutrality, I feel that we need to get the word out more.  We need
to do what we can to make sure people are aware of proposals like Ted
Stevens' Telecom bill because like most things, people aren't going to
take notice until it is directly affecting them, and usually by then it
is too late.  Once the door is closed, it takes a lot for people to
get that door opened back up.

What Is with the Pro-KDE Slant?</h4><p>
I don't understand this.  Since that copy of <i  >LJ</i> with the rant on KDE
vs. GNOME [April 2006], I've been reading a lot of support for KDE in
<i  >LJ</i> (for the
last two issues, no less), while scantly any for the GNOME side.  I find
Mr Soulier's &ldquo;Even Einstein Agrees&rdquo; [June 2006, Letters] rather cute,
but I think he attempted to apply Einstein's quote backwards.
</p><p>
My school's labs all use KDE, and I'm almost tempted to configure
.xsession or .xinitrc to use twm instead.  I think the following analogy
makes the most sense.  KDE is like Gentoo, you could configure it to a
very fine level of detail, but you can hardly do any work until you
have tinkered with it.  GNOME is like Ubuntu, you need only very little
customization to make it work the way that you want and expect.  Things
in both Ubuntu and GNOME are well integrated.  I'm not sure I'd use the
same description for KDE or Gentoo.  I'm thankful that Linus Torvalds
started the Linux movement, but he couldn't be more wrong with the KDE
vs. GNOME issue.  And know more than enough people (many of whom are
far smarter than I am, and from whom I seek advice and respect their opinions)
in my Computing Science Student Society who couldn't think of a single
good thing to say about KDE.
</p><p>
With such a severe lack of balance on this issue, sometimes I'm glad that
I don't subscribe to <i  >LJ</i>.  I used to have more respect, when it did create
dialog.  Now it almost seems like discussion has degenerated to fan-boyism,
and dissent is not tolerated.

I fail to see any pro-KDE slant in <i  >Linux Journal</i> content.  Outside of
those (including myself) who express their opinions one way or another,
we take great pains to make sure our content reflects a neutral
view.  &mdash;Ed.

Damn Small Is Damn Good</h4><p>
Thank you very much for publishing the &ldquo;USB Pendrives and Distributions
for Them&rdquo; article in <i  >LJ</i> [June 2006].  I have toyed with
DSL (Damn
Small Linux) and even purchased one of their pendrives to contribute to
their project.  In the past, however, I wasn't able to follow through with
creating my own pendrive, and Juan Marcelo Rodriguez's article came as a godsend.
I downloaded DSL-N, which has the 2.6 kernel.  Despite the fact that this
project still has some bugs, I sense lots of potential in it and will
try to help them by reporting bugs and testing.  I felt very happy about
making my own pendrive (I have some troubles with the wireless card but
I haven't done enough research on the matter to be able to ask smart
questions), and I look forward to testing other live distros.

Maddog's Compaq History Rears Its Head</h4><p>
I read, with not inconsiderable interest, parts of the article by Jon
&ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall entitled &ldquo;Sinking of the USS
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Proprietary</em></span>&rdquo;, <i  >Linux Journal</i>,
July 2006, wherein appeared: &ldquo;USS
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Compact</em></span>&rdquo;.  Well, now,
I must really wonder if he instead meant &ldquo;USS
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Compaq</em></span>&rdquo;.  I just hope
you can now concur! &ldquo;And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall
make you free&rdquo; (ref.: John 8:32, KJV, 1611).  <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tempus fugit et
ad augusta per angusta</em></span>.

For Shame</h4><p>
Shame on you for using proprietary software.  Of all people, an old OS/2
veteran such as yourself should surely be aware of the fundamental evils
of proprietary software.
</p><p>
Remember TrueSpectra Photo-Graphics? It was a wonderful OS/2 application
that seamlessly combined raster and vector graphics.  Where did it
go? Down the proprietary rat hole.  All the progress that TrueSpectra
made in image processing has effectively vanished as if it had never
existed.  That is an unconscionable waste, and we are still waiting for
someone to reinvent the wheel.
</p><p>
While I formerly tolerated proprietary software, experience has pushed me
toward a different view.  I now stand in full agreement with Hans Reiser,
who says, &ldquo;Equal Source Code Access Is A Civil Right&rdquo;.

New Life in <i  >LJ</i></h4><p>
After being a subscriber to <i  >Linux Journal</i> from the very first issue,
I must confess that the articles started to lose interest for me around
the year 2000.  I assumed the journal had, to use the TV metaphor,
&ldquo;jumped the shark&rdquo;, given the popularity of everything with the word
Linux at the time.  It was almost simply out of loyalty that I have
continued to resubscribe the last several years.  That is, until about
a few issues ago.  Suddenly, the articles are much more relevant
and useful.  Whatever you have done, please keep it up!
