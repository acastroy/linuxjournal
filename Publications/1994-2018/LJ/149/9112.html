The world's best suit rolls up new sleeves.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2484580.0x257c348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
J.P. Rangaswami won't be defending his title as CIO of the Year, because
that's no longer his job at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, one of the
world's leading investment banks.  But he still works there&mdash;harder
than ever, from what I could tell when I ran into him at the latest
Reboot conference in Copenhagen.  (He lives in the UK, when he isn't
traveling the world, looking for ways to reconcile the leading edge
with sturdy infrastructure.)
</p><p>
At Reboot, J.P. gave a knockout keynote address, in which he volleyed
back a number of ideas I have also been lobbing over the Net and here
in <i  >Linux Journal</i>.  As always, he enlarged those ideas considerably,
while adding many new ones of his own.  Here are a few:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
People are not assembly-line things.  What makes us different is that
we are different.  And to try to create standardized norms of us is
where evil starts stepping into organizations.  It's building
hospitals where you centralize ill people.  Very clever, right? Why
would people do that? You know many people die of exposure to
illness while they are ill? The last place you want to spend any
time is in a central hospital.  That place is a production of
industrial thought, not human thought....
</p><p>
This capacity to bond was denied us because of the
divide-and-conquer garbage that we were exposed to, probably for the
last four or five hundred years&mdash;and made a lot more sophisticated
through the any-color-you-want-as-long-as-it's-black assembly-line-production-factory approach to humanity.  And it doesn't scale.  It
doesn't work....
</p><p>
If you go to many Eastern countries, <span   class="emphasis"><em>identity</em></span> is not about who I
am, because the I is very unusual.  Identity is about <span   class="emphasis"><em>what I belong
to</em></span>.  Identity is a statement of the community that I belong to.
Identity is a statement of things that I will associate with me,
that empower me as a result of belonging to something....
</p><p>
There are many things you can use identity for.  But if you
understand that even a passport, three hundred or four hundred years
ago, used to say, &ldquo;I know this person.  Will you please look out for
him.&rdquo; Not, &ldquo;These are his permissions and these are the things he can
do and this is what he needs a visa for.&rdquo; None of that stuff.  It was
elective to say, &ldquo;Since I know you and I know this person, look
after this guy.  He's a good guy.&rdquo; It was a trusted domain-type
statement.  And then also to say, &ldquo;If he needs anything, if he's ill, if he
needs some food, if he needs shelter, help him out.&rdquo; That's what the
passport used to be.  Look what it's become.  And we've allowed this
to happen.  We've allowed things to be taken away from us, rather
than saying, &ldquo;Let's build new things.&rdquo; I only want us to get back
what we had....
</p><p>
The first death is device lock-in....Can you imagine me telling
people, &ldquo;You cannot use your own pen&rdquo;? Or, &ldquo;You can't use your own
voice.&rdquo;
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Afterwards, I thought it would be fun to continue the volley in the form
of an interview.  Here it is.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc: Are (or were) there any other CIOs like you? Meaning, ones
that embrace open source, DIY-IT, re-usability and disruptions you
know are going to be more constructive and stable in the long run
than the technologies being disrupted?</em></span>
</p><p>
JP: I think there are many others, but I had some advantages.  One,
given our size and shape, innovation was an imperative rather than a
nice-to-have.  Two, we have some very talented people working in IT
at DrKW.  Three, we had management commitment and buy-in, which also
goes a long way.  So, it was easier for me to do this than for many of my
peers.  Other CIOs that come to mind are Al-Noor Ramji at BT (who,
incidentally, hired me at DrKW!), Tom Sanzone at Credit Suisse and
David Yu at Betfair.  David is now the CEO at Betfair, which is going
some.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc: You are widely regarded as the best CIO in the world (and
have won awards for that).  Yet you moved on to another job at DrKW.
How come? And what does that say for the CIO job in
general?</em></span>
</p><p>
JP: Well, I'd done five long years, and I needed a fresh
challenge.  My lifeblood is in innovation, so it made sense for me to
join our Digital Markets operation&mdash;a bunch of very tech-literate
and tech-friendly people, who have done wonders in actually using
Web 2.0 tools rather than talking about them.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Doc: What is your new job and what is it about?</em></span>
</p><p>
JP: I'm the Head of Alternative Market Models in our Digital
Markets unit.  Simply put, my role is to take our learning in Web 2.0
from the enterprise to our customer base.  There's a high involvement
in technology as a result, so I can continue to work with my
erstwhile colleagues.  And it's refreshing.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc: What are less-recognized but important trends you see
happening with (or coming from) open source? Or with Linux in particular,
since we center our focus on that platform?</em></span>
</p><p>
JP: I see three things against a common background.
</p><p>
First, the background.  People have finally come to grips with the
fact that open source is about commoditized infrastructure and not
about communism.  In fact, open source is more secure than
proprietary architectures, and that really helps us take
advantage of Moore and Metcalfe effects.  It helps us get away from
the traditional full-of-holes and insecure arguments and gives us a
sound business basis for doing it.
</p><p>
One is a shift in scope and breadth: Linux is about ecosystems and
not vertical stacks, which changes the way we manage our portfolio.
</p><p>
Two is a shift in time: beta now means live.  We have learned to bring
iteration into our processes&mdash;something that we needed to discover
was the value of democratized innovation.
</p><p>
Three is a shift in workforce location: adoption of Linux and open-source principles really helps us work better with a geographically
dispersed workforce; Linux is ubiquitous, it engenders faster and
cheaper localization and is easier to support on a global basis
than any proprietary architecture.
</p><p>
By the way, I'm also intrigued by where NAND RAM is going, Robson
and so forth, and watching very carefully what that means for us in years to
come.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc: You've talked about technologies or practices that you
consider dead or terminal.  DRM, for example.  Device lock-in.  Yet,
major vendors such as Apple, in spite of their embracing of open
source, remain very committed to both DRM and device lock-in.  The
iPod, while a brilliant technological and marketing achievement, may
now be the world's largest and most successful silo, combining both
DRM and device lock-in.  Is there any hope that these companies will
get clues from leaders on the customer side like yourself?</em></span>
</p><p>
JP: As people recognize the sheer cost and inefficiency of DRM and
device lock-in, I think this will change.  Right now, everyone's used
to levels of lock-in at the device, but as I said at Reboot, things
are changing.  Generation M will resist and the market will drive
vendor behavior.  Generation M is predisposed against lock-in,
unlike our generation.  And things will change.  Like the phone
example.  First, you rent a black phone from the phone company; then
you buy a color phone, but only from the phone company; then you buy
any phone from anywhere.  If iPod and iTunes want to emulate Polaroid,
that's their call, but I have faith that they will see the light.
And it won't take 100 years like with the phone companies.  It will
take maybe three years.
</p><p>
When generation M goes to work, those people will have their pens and their
computers and their phones and their cameras.  Not company-issued
ones.  And we have a job to do to pave the way for them, which is
where identity and authentication and permissioning and
walled-garden arguments begin and end.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Doc: I've talked and written about the &ldquo;because of&rdquo; principle,
which says you make more money <span class="emphasis"><em>because of</em></span> infrastructure (such as
the Net, Linux and the LAMP stack) than you do <span class="emphasis"><em>with</em></span>
infrastructure.  I discovered that principle by following open-source
development, by the way.  You recently responded
on your blog
(<a href="http://confusedofcalcutta.com/2006/06/09/four-pillars-because-of-rather-than-with-a-very-provisional-post" target="_self">confusedofcalcutta.com/2006/06/09/four-pillars-because-of-rather-than-with-a-very-provisional-post</a>),
framing the &ldquo;because of&rdquo; principle in terms of
chronology.  For example, you say companies shift over time from
&ldquo;with&rdquo; to &ldquo;because&rdquo; strategies.  So here are two observations I'd
like to get your thoughts on.</em></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>
First, there are lots of &ldquo;because&rdquo; companies that seem unaware of
that fact.  The infrastructural code they use is just cheap or free
building material.  The big Web-based companies, from Amazon to
Google to Yahoo to Akamai, are &ldquo;because of&rdquo; companies.  They make
money because of Linux and Apache, not with those things.</em></span>
</p><p>
JP: Yes.  &ldquo;Because of&rdquo; companies tend to avoid understanding what
they are largely as a result of misconceptions: &ldquo;Because&rdquo; doesn't
have buzz, &ldquo;because&rdquo; doesn't have innovation and so on.
&ldquo;Because&rdquo; has a
bad name.  In the UK we have a phrase: &ldquo;Where there's muck there's
brass&rdquo;, which roughly translates to, &ldquo;There's money to be made in
cleaning things up, in providing basic services.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Open source is all about commodity and infrastructure, so we
understand that.  I think you will find that Warren Buffett invests
primarily in &ldquo;Because&rdquo; companies.  Someone should do research on the
split between &ldquo;because&rdquo; and &ldquo;with&rdquo; in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio.
</p><p>
Follow the money.  &ldquo;Because&rdquo; companies will make money
because &ldquo;with&rdquo;
companies need them.  &ldquo;Because&rdquo; is actually lower risk, smooths out
kinks, creates annuity returns.  &ldquo;Because&rdquo; is safe.  It just takes
time for us to understand that.
</p><p>
As you say, many of today's technology leaders would not exist if it
weren't for &ldquo;because&rdquo; companies.  I don't see Linux or Apache
screaming like the telcos for their share of the dough; nor do I see
FedEx or Wal-Mart scream.  There is good money in &ldquo;because&rdquo;.
</p><p>
I also think that there is no such thing as a &ldquo;because&rdquo; vacuum.  If
no one invests in a &ldquo;because&rdquo; space, and people are scared of the
upfront investment, then the &ldquo;because&rdquo; community will innovate to
find a new way.  That's what happened to fixed-line and mobile in the
developing world.
</p><p>
This year, even before he took up his new job at DrKW, J.P. took up
blogging.  You'll find his posts&mdash;often long, always
thoughtful&mdash;at
