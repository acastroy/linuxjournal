Those who need to run legacy Windows applications on Linux should
consider CrossOver Office 5.0.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e15580.0x1f0d2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
CodeWeavers' CrossOver Office 5.0 is a commercial application
based on Wine that allows you to run many popular Microsoft
Windows-based office and productivity applications under Linux, as well
as a few multimedia and Internet applications.  For those who are tied
to Microsoft Office in particular, it can provide a means to migrate
to Linux.
</p><p>
Supported applications include:

For people researching CrossOver Office with a mind to deploying the
product in their workplace or as a single-user home installation, the
CodeWeavers' Web site is an excellent resource (<a href="http://www.codeweavers.com" target="_self">www.codeweavers.com</a>).  Clear and well-written
information is grouped in a logical manner.  Case studies illustrate how
effectively the product copes in real-world situations, and questions
about Microsoft licensing are addressed.
</p><p>
CodeWeavers offers a time-limited demonstration version of its
products.  For 30 days, you can try the full capabilities of the product
without being limited in functionality.  This is an excellent
way to let customers test the compatibility
and performance of the product for themselves before committing to purchasing a license.
</p><p>
CodeWeavers' CrossOver Office comes in three main flavours.  The Standard
Edition, which we tested here, is a standalone application licensed
for a single user with limited support and upgrade period.  If any
other users on the machine want to use CodeWeavers' CrossOver Office,
they need to purchase their own copy.  The Standard Edition is
available only as an 11MB download.
</p><p>
CrossOver Office Professional is also standalone, with support for
multiple local users.  It can be purchased on CD as well as downloaded,
and it includes 12 months of a higher level of support.  Bulk and educational
discounts are available.
</p><p>
CrossOver Office Server Edition provides a centrally managed way of
distributing Windows productivity applications to Linux thin clients,
with a premium level of support designed for large-scale deployments.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e15580.0x1f0e1b8"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
CrossOver Office is distributed as a large bourne shell script.  On
invoking the script, a graphical installer is launched that takes you
through the install and configuration process.  We found the installer
to be simple to use.  Once the installer was complete, CrossOver Office
then offered us a dialog through which to install various Microsoft
Windows software.  The installation process automatically created entries
in our KDE and GNOME menus, a CrossOver submenu with access to various
CrossOver Office tools and a Windows Applications menu for our Windows
application launchers once installed.

</p></div></div><p>
The installation process was quick, painless and easy to follow.  We give
CrossOver Office a thumbs up for installation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e15580.0x1f0e4d0"></a>
Ease of Use</h2></div></div><p>
One installed, we immediately tested installing an application from the
Internet by selecting the Internet Explorer browser.  CrossOver Office
gave us excellent feedback, letting us know what it was doing at each
stage of the process.  The familiar Windows installer dialog for Internet
Explorer was launched, and after clicking through the wizard, we were
returned to CrossOver Office while it simulated a Windows reboot.  Once
this was complete, an Internet Explorer launcher could be found in the
KDE menu under Windows Applications, making finding and executing the
newly installed program a breeze.

</p></div></div><p>
We tested installing software from CD using Microsoft Office 2000.  The
application installer managed to detect the correct CD-ROM drive and
install from it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e15580.0x1f0e7e8"></a>
Documentation</h2></div></div><p>
The user guide for CrossOver Office is distributed as HTML files on disk
suitable for off-line reading.  The documentation is clear and
easy to read, with helpful screenshots.  It covers an exhaustive range
of issues from installing CrossOver Office and Windows
applications, to more advanced topics, such as the configuration of
Windows emulation options.
</p><p>
The troubleshooting section was a little confusing, with a long cluttered
list of frequently asked questions.  The FAQ does cover a wide range
of questions, and we recommend reading it for handy tips.
We give CrossOver Office a thumbs up for documentation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e15580.0x1f0e948"></a>
Compatibility</h2></div></div><p>
CrossOver Office installed and ran without a hitch on SUSE, Ubuntu and
Slackware Linux.  The list of supported distributions currently includes:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Red Hat 9
</p></li><li><p>
Fedora Core 4
</p></li><li><p>
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 3 and 4
</p></li><li><p>
SUSE 10.0
</p></li><li><p>
Novell Linux Desktop
</p></li><li><p>
Mandriva 10.x
</p></li><li><p>
Debian Stable
</p></li><li><p>
Ubuntu 5.04
</p></li><li><p>
Ubuntu 5.10
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Given the reasonable range of modern distributions supported and that
CrossOver Office worked very well even on unsupported distributions we tried,
we give CrossOver Office a thumbs up for compatibility.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e15580.0x1f059c0"></a>
Support</h2></div></div><p>
Support for the standalone editions is available in two levels.  CrossOver
Office Standard includes six months of Level 3 support.  This level of
support includes fixes for installation issues and only the most grievous
problems with supported applications on tested distributions: &ldquo;...you
should not expect a rapid or complete response to any but the most
serious problems.&rdquo;
</p><p>
CrossOver Office Professional includes 12 months of Level 2 support.  This
level of support promises problem resolution for any problem found
within any supported application.  Any Level 2 problem will be triaged
and logged.  Problems encountered on non-tested distributions will be
considered.
</p><p>
The archives of the support ticketing system used by all levels of
support can be found on the CodeWeavers' Web site and can be accessed by
unregistered users, allowing all users of the software to search the
database to find solutions to their problems.  For lesser support levels,
CodeWeavers provides a medium-volume mailing list and an IRC channel.
</p><p>
We went to the IRC channel to find support for various minor
problems we encountered.  The person who helped us was courteous and
friendly and very well informed.  We give CrossOver Office a thumbs up
for support.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e15580.0x1f05c28"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>How We Tested</b></p><p>
We tested by installing CrossOver Office on three machines.  Waste is
a Pentium 4 1.7GHz with 512MB memory running Ubuntu, and Holly is a
Pentium III 700MHz with 256MB of memory running SUSE.  To check how
CrossOver Office
installs on unsupported distributions, we also tried running various
applications on Hal, a 2.4GHz with 1,024MB of memory and Slackware Linux.
</p><p>
We installed Internet Explorer, Apple's iTunes music player, Adobe
Photoshop 7.0 and Microsoft Office 2000 on both machines.  To test the
stability of these applications, we performed a range of fairly standard
tasks with them&mdash;playing MP3s from disk and streamed from music shares
on a Macintosh with iTunes, touching up photographs with Adobe Photoshop,
using Internet Explorer for Webmail and on-line banking and opening and
editing various Word and Excel files with MS Office.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e15580.0x1f05e90"></a>
Capability</h2></div></div><p>
Microsoft Office, Photoshop and IE performed well on Waste and tolerably
on Holly.  Given Waste's modest specifications, as compared to even the
cheapest of new machines today, we think this is pretty reasonable.  Even
running natively under Windows, Photoshop 7 isn't terribly fast on a
Pentium III.  The applications were not completely stable and crashed a
few times during testing.  All applications suffered from occasional
rendering glitches.
</p><p>
iTunes and QuickTime required considerably more CPU power, and Holly's
700MHz was simply not up to the task.  Audio crackled and was jerky, and
video completely refused to play.  Even on Waste, iTunes was unbearably
slow to use and respond to user interaction.  No amount of coaxing could
convince it to play music smoothly.  We tried various suggestions from support
without success.
</p><p>
Due to some issues with stability and drastic problems with multimedia
over multiple distributions, we give CrossOver Office a flat hand for
capability.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8834f3.large.jpg"><img src="8834f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Price</h2></div></div><p>
At $39.95 US, CrossOver Standard is relatively inexpensive&mdash;certainly
cheaper that purchasing a licensed copy of Windows.  Most professional
users would consider $69.95 US to be a reasonable price to pay for the
higher level of support.  We give CrossOver Office a thumbs up for price.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e15580.0x1f06308"></a>
Overall Rating</h2></div></div><p>
In summary, CodeWeavers CrossOver Office is a promising product, and
we give it a final score of very good.  We recommend strongly that you
run CrossOver Office on a decent machine with some good processing
power and lots of RAM.  On anything less, CrossOver Office would score
satisfactory at best.  With the right hardware though, it easily
could have earned a score of excellent if it weren't for the fact that it has
minor stability problems and difficulty getting multimedia applications
working properly.  This brings down the overall score of a product that has
excellent documentation, support and an easy-to-use interface.  Hopefully,
future versions of CrossOver Office will address these points, making
it a more viable professional product for hardware that is less than
the latest and greatest.

CrossOver Office 5.0 is a great solution for those who must run some
popular legacy Windows applications under Linux.  It has some glitches,
and you need good hardware to get the best out of the product, but it
does the job it is designed to do quite well.
