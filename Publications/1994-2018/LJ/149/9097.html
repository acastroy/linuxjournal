MILLE-XTERM provides a scalable infrastructure for massive
X-terminal deployment.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1034580.0x112c710"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Linux-based X terminals are well known for making computing affordable,
for giving a second life to old hardware and for lightening
administrative burdens.  If you ever have toyed with the idea of using Linux
X terminals, you are probably familiar with the Linux Terminal Server
Project (LTSP), described in Figure 1.  An LTSP server is perfectly
suited for small workgroups or classrooms.  However, in order to deploy
a greater number of terminals, say thousands of them, the current LTSP model
encounters scalability problems.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9097f1.large.jpg"><img src="9097f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

The main goals of the MILLE-XTERM Project are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Unlimited scalability.
</p></li><li><p>
Centralized X-terminal management.
</p></li><li><p>
Enhanced user experience.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The MILLE-XTERM Project applied clustering concepts to the
X-terminal infrastructure to achieve these goals.
</p><p>
The MILLE Project is funded by Canadian public agencies and school
districts in the province of Quebec.  MILLE means &ldquo;Free Software
Infrastructure Model for Education&rdquo; and is targeted at educational
institutions.  It is composed of four subprojects: a portal (based on
uportal), an open-source middleware stack, a CD with free software for
Windows/Mac and, finally, MILLE-XTERM (the object of the present article).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1034580.0x112cd98"></a>
Overview of a MILLE-XTERM Cluster</h2></div></div><p>
The solution entails centralizing servers in a secure, air-conditioned
computer room to form a cluster of terminal servers.  The cluster has four
major components, as shown in Figure 2.  The first is the boot server,
which provides DHCP and TFTP services and serves as a base system optimized
for the terminals via NFS.  Next comes the configurator, which generates the
lts.cfg configuration file from an SQL database.  The terminal then queries
the load balancer, which in turn seeks out the cluster's least-loaded
application server.  The chosen application server login screen then
appears,
and after a successful authentication, the user can start using the desktop,
browser, office suite and other applications.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9097f2.large.jpg"><img src="9097f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2.  Clustered LTSP Network Diagram
</p></div></div><p>
MILLE-XTERM relies on central file and authentication services that provide
users with the same account and file on every application server.  The
open-source choice is NFS for users' home directories and OpenLDAP for the
directory service.  It also can be integrated into a Novell or Windows
environment with additional configuration.
</p><p>
Unlike LTSP, there is no need for a separate network dedicated to terminals.
They can share a LAN with other PCs.  However, a reliable network
infrastructure is crucial.  With usual usage, each terminal generates an
average of 1Mb/sec of X11 traffic.  Low-end hubs should be avoided; managed
switches with full-duplex capabilities really make a difference.
</p><p>
Unlike LTSP, each component is built from RPMs; system administrators
easily
can add features and local applications with standard package
manager tools.  The init scripts from the distribution are replaced by
standard LTSP scripts.  We are currently using Mandriva 2006 as the base
distribution, though other distributions can be supported.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1034580.0x112d160"></a>
Boot Server for Terminal</h2></div></div><p>
The boot server is mainly a read-only NFS server.  Optionally, it can provide
DHCP, TFTP and NBD swap services.  The xtermroot contains a base system and
an X server.  With more than one boot server, it is easy to rsync
the xtermroot periodically on each boot server.  The terminals then boot in a
uniform way, whichever boot server they use.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1034580.0x112d268"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Boot Methods</b></p><p>
MILLE-XTERM supports different booting methods: CD-ROM, local hard drive,
Flash disk, Etherboot or PXE.  Each boot method has its advantages and
drawbacks.
</p><p>
PXE and Etherboot rely on TFTP to transmit the initial file used for the
boot process.  It simplifies the deployment, as no configuration is stored on
the terminal itself.  However, simultaneously booting up hundreds of clients
via TFTP can result in transmission errors and, consequently, boot problems.
</p><p>
An alternative is to use a 16MB IDE Flash disk that holds the kernel, the
initrd and grub.  The Flash disk is updated automatically as the terminal
boots up.  The disk is used only at startup and contains no moving parts.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1034580.0x112d528"></a>
Getting Configuration under Control</h2></div></div><p>
Diskless terminals need a way to store configuration data, such as screen
resolution and available printers.  Under LTSP, a central file called
lts.conf stores the configuration of terminals and has to be edited
manually.  With thousands of terminals, you need a hierarchical
database&mdash;that's the purpose of the configurator.
</p><p>
This component is written in PHP and has two interfaces.  The first is
dedicated to terminals.  During the boot process, the terminal requests its
configuration from the server using its MAC address as a parameter.  The server
generates the corresponding configuration and sends it to the terminal in
the standard lts.conf format.  A wrapper around the getltscfg command
ensures backward compatibility with the other LTSP scripts.
</p><p>
The other interface lets administrators manage the configuration of
the terminals via a Web browser.  Administrators can organize terminals
hierarchically by groups and apply configurations according to specific
criteria, such as location or hardware type.  But the configurator serves yet
another function.  It is designed to work with links, a console text browser,
as shown in Figure 3.  The terminal can boot in a special admin mode that
does not require running the X server.  To boot in this mode, the option
mode=admin is appended to the kernel options in the bootloader configuration.
Then, links is launched with the terminal configurator URL and MAC.  The
administrator can change the terminal settings directly.  When complete, the
terminal reboots and receives its new configuration.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9097f3.large.jpg"><img src="9097f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3.  Xterm-Based Administration System
</p></div></div><p>
The configurator also is useful for building terminal inventories.  Hardware
information is sent to the configurator during the boot process.
Administrators can generate reports regarding the state of the terminals.  Also,
every connection to the configurator is logged and then can be analyzed to
determine terminal usage, user login information and much more.  You know
how managers like reports!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1034580.0x112d8f0"></a>
Load Balancing between Application Servers</h2></div></div><p>
When a terminal boots, it requests a display from the application server.  To
dispatch users on available application servers, MILLE-XTERM provides a load
balancer.  The first version of the load balancer (proof of concept) required
five lines of PHP and returned a random address from a static list of
application servers.  Although simple, this approach had some drawbacks.
First, an off-line server should be removed from the list and not be returned
to the terminals.  And, to provide reliable load balancing, several factors,
such as number of processors, speed and load average have to be taken into
account.  Therefore, a much more robust and complete Python system has
replaced the initial prototype (Figure 4).
The load balancer agent runs on every application server,
collecting data on the state of the application server and waiting for
load-balancer server requests.  The balancer is also a Python script that runs on
the boot server.  It contacts each load-balancer agent to determine its
state and computes a weight for each server.  A greater weight indicates
that the server is less loaded and will be selected more often
statistically to accept new users.  A terminal request for an application server will then
prompt the load-balancer server to get a randomly chosen application server
in the weighted list.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9097f4.large.jpg"><img src="9097f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4.  Load Balancing the LTSP Cluster
</p></div></div><p>
Let's examine a concrete example: three application servers and two boot servers.
Install the mille-xterm-lbagent package on each application server, and
install mille-xterm-lbserver on each boot server.  Make sure that the respective
services are started, lbagent and lbserver.  Add one node entry for each
application server in the file /etc/mille-xterm/lbsconfig.xml:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
 &lt;lbsconfig&gt;
  &lt;nodes&gt;
   &lt;group default="true" name="PROD"&gt;
    &lt;node address="http://10.0.0.1:8001" name="xapp1"/&gt;
    &lt;node address="http://10.0.0.2:8001" name="xapp2"/&gt;
    &lt;node address="http://10.0.0.3:8001" name="xapp3"/&gt;
   &lt;/group&gt;
  &lt;/nodes&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Copy this file on every boot server.  Fire up a browser and enter the URL of
the load balancer to see it in action.  By default, lbserver listens on port
8008, so don't forget to append the port to the URL:
http://localhost:8008/.
IP addresses of the chosen application server will
be displayed.  Press the refresh button to get a new IP and you're set!

Getting the Best User Experience</h2></div></div><p>
The MILLE-XTERM Project focuses on user experience.  A MILLE-XTERM
X terminal has to provide the same functions as a regular workstation.  In
order to achieve this goal, extensive desktop personalization is required.
Here are some of the most important topics:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Sound support: because the applications run on the server and the sound
card is on the terminal, using /dev/dsp doesn't work.  Solutions such as
Esound, Arts, Nas and others have been developed over time.  We have found
that Arts can make a machine unstable (for example, TiMidity++ takes up to
99% of the CPU) and that very few applications support Nas.  In our
experience, the only workable solution is Esound (esd).  GNOME support is
native, and KDE, which uses Arts, has an option to use esd as its back end.
Major applications, such as Flash Player, RealPlayer and SDL-based games,
use it natively.  When users first log in to the system, a script
automatically creates configuration files to use esd.  However, there is
still work to do.  For example, Audacity does not yet support esd.
</p></li><li><p>
Video support: with Windows, people usually use QuickTime, RealPlayer or
Windows Media Player.  They expect these essential packages to work on an
X terminal.  This is a bit of a challenge, as most distributions do not
provide these players and appropriate codecs.  Those familiar with the
command-line swear by MPlayer, and others swear at it.  A Mozilla plugin
called mplayerplug-in solves the problem and neatly embeds MPlayer in the
Web browser with Play, Pause and Forward buttons.  MPlayer also
can use Windows DLLs optionally to play popular file formats, but as with all
proprietary programs, there are many licensing issues to consider.
</p></li><li><p>
Local applications: some applications simply cannot operate with the
standard client/server scenario.  For example, if users want to control the
volume of the terminal sound card, they must run Aumix or Alsamixer locally
on the terminal.  Also, running the media player directly on the terminal is
better than streaming 30 frames per second over the network, as this can
quickly clog the network.  In these instances, these applications run better
when bunched locally on the terminal.  To that end, a wrapper script called
runlocal connects to the terminal with the user key via SSH and mounts
the user's home directory via sshfs, allowing the application to access user
files and settings.
</p></li><li><p>
Application configuration: most applications will create their own
configuration files when first launched.  In many cases, the default works
well.  In other cases, they need to be modified for use on an X terminal.  For
instance, several applications use the X-server memory as a cache memory.
Although this is very efficient on a Linux workstation, it can cause an
X-terminal crash when the memory used by the X server is bigger than the RAM
of the terminal.  An effective way to diagnose problems with X-server memory
consumption is to use the xrestop tool.  For KDE users, this kind of
memory problem may occur when copying/pasting a large drawing with Klipper
enabled.  The only solution at this point is to disable Klipper.
Here's a sample Firefox configuration that disables memory and disk cache:

<pre     class="programlisting">
// File /opt/firefox/greprefs/xterm.js
pref("general.config.obscure_value", 0);
pref("general.config.filename", "firefox.cfg");

// File /opt/firefox/firefox.cfg
lockPref("browser.cache.disk.enable", false);
lockPref("browser.cache.memory.enable", false);
lockPref("browser.sessionhistory.max_total_viewers", 0);
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
Personalization: many projects are focusing on language issues, such
as internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n).  However,
still no personalization layer (p13n) provides an easy way to configure
icons on the desktop, menus, browser preferences, bookmarks,
backgrounds, screensavers, default applications and so forth.  Work has begun in the
freedesktop.org project and with Sabayon and Kiosk, for instance, but it
remains far from complete and covers only KDE and GNOME.  In the meantime, we
use a set of homemade scripts and config files to configure the desktop
according to an organization's needs.
</p></li><li><p>
Global infrastructure integration: to be successful, the system must be
integrated fully into the existing infrastructure (directory server, files
and
printing).  Take printing, for example.  If a school district has 50 schools
and more than a thousand different printers, how do you select which ones to
display in Firefox or OpenOffice.org? We solved the challenge with a simple
wrapper that intercepts calls to the CUPS shared library in order to apply a
filter based on the user location.  The printer list and the default printer
for the terminal is stored in the configurator database.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1034580.0x1124b20"></a>
Virtualization of Components with Linux-VServers</h2></div></div><p>
For security and administrative considerations, making isolated MILLE-XTERM
components is possible.  To gain the benefits of virtualization without
performance drawbacks, Linux-VServer is the perfect alternative, although a
few specific configurations are needed to install MILLE-XTERM inside a
Linux-VServer.  When installing a boot server in a vserver, it is not feasible to
generate the initrd, unless the vserver has the CAP_SYS_ADMIN property set.
The solution is to use a chroot on the host.  Also, a user-space NFS server is
used instead of the regular kernel-based nfsd.  Finally, GDM on the
application server will try to launch X inside a vserver, which is not
needed.  To correct this, append the --no-console option to the init script
and it will listen only for network requests with no local host display.
</p><p>
When mastered, these few tricks allow you to add or remove application
servers, copy existing application servers, back up and update them, and when
satisfied with the changes, put them into production and duplicate them
throughout the cluster, thereby elevating manageability to a higher level.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1034580.0x1124c80"></a>
Future Developments</h2></div></div><p>
MILLE-XTERM can go further in a number of ways&mdash;beginning with
security, or the lack thereof, as is the case of the XDMCP protocol.  You can
try it at home.  Start an X session with Xnest and capture packets
with ethereal.  The following filter lets you view every keystroke
typed:

<pre     class="programlisting">
x11.eventcode == 2
</pre>
</p><p>
You could solve the problem with a local secure display manager that creates
an SSH tunnel to encrypt the X11 traffic.  Another possibility is to use
OpenVPN between the terminal and the application server.
</p><p>
Almost every component of the MILLE-XTERM Project should be highly
available.  Work is in progress for the configurator (using slony replication
for the PostgreSQL database).  The boot servers (as well as the load
balancer) will follow in order to have transparent failover (this can be
achieved easily because their main functionality is as a read-only NFS
server).
</p><p>
Optimizing the X protocol in order to save bandwidth is another interesting
development.  One can then use an X terminal with a simple broadband Internet
connection.  The next step for Linux terminals is NX/FreeNX.  Last year,
<i  >Linux Journal</i> devoted five articles to the topic.  NX clients would run locally
on terminals, which would then require them to be added to the xtermroot in order to
work.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1034580.0x1124f40"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Currently, more than 800 terminals are deployed with MILLE-XTERM at the
Laval School District (one of the founders of the MILLE Project), and the
plan is to deploy more than 1,000 additional terminals yearly (up to 75% of
the existing computers will become X terminals).
</p><p>
We strongly believe that Linux terminals are the key solution that will
allow school districts to provide a low-cost/high-quality desktop
experience.  With a cluster of Linux terminal servers, children can
access the software they need to learn, create and be part of the Linux
revolution.
