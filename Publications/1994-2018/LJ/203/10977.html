The problem with mind-control devices is they generally work only in
very close proximity to the host. In our ongoing quest to take over the
world, we've come up with a way to keep our open-source mind probes
tethered to our victims at all times: embedding Linux into the phones of
the populace. With the help of Google and its vow against being evil
(tee-hee!), we've taken over a significant percentage of the market. Soon,
our free ideals and open standards will take over the world! MWAHAHAHA!
</p><p>
Okay, perhaps I should avoid watching vintage sci-fi films right before
writing my column. Nonetheless, this month is an exciting issue. Our
focus is &ldquo;Linux in Your Pocket&rdquo;.
Whether you're a fan of Android, Maemo, MeeGo or Moblin, the mobile
computer market is busting at the seams with tablets, phones and Netbook
crossovers.
</p><p>
Having armies of Android minions is pointless if you can't program them to
bend to your will, and Paul Barry shows us that Java isn't the only way to
make Android apps. Python is a very popular scripting language, and Python
for Android opens up mobile device programming for a whole bunch of people.
If Android isn't your cup of tea, you might be interested in MeeGo 1.1.
Ibrahim Haddad describes the ins and outs of the project that sprouted from
Intel's Moblin and Nokia's Maemo. Some people love it, and some people
hate it,
but it works on both Netbooks and smartphones, so trying it should
be pretty simple.
</p><p>
Granted, merely running Linux on mobile devices isn't a recipe for world
domination, but Stuart Jarvis explains how to keep tabs on the world
itself with Marble. The KDE program, which is a virtual globe, has been
ported to mobile devices that support Nokia's Qt framework. Although spinning
a globe on your handheld certainly is entertaining, because it's a digital
globe, the features are a bit more robust. We may have gotten ants
dizzy on the globe in geography class back in school; however, with Marble, you get a
smart globe capable of mapping destinations and planning trips. If you add
augmented reality to the mix, you can take a complete vacation without ever
taking your eyes off your phone! Rick Rogers shows how to use augmented
reality with HTML5 for an experience reminiscent of the heads-up display
used in every first-person-shooter game ever made. I don't recommend
walking around with your cell phone strapped to your face, but it does make
quick order of unfamiliar surroundings.
</p><p>
If by some odd chance you're not a mad scientist bent on creating
pocket-sized mind-control devices, fear not. This issue has many other
great articles and columns to scratch that Linux itch. Kyle Rankin starts
a series on personal servers, proving that everyone can be sysadmins, even
if they never leave their home offices. Whether you're looking to host a
local file server or manage Internet services from your basement, Kyle's
series is an exciting one for those interested in taking charge of their
data. If you do host your own server, you'll want to read Mick Bauer's
column as well&mdash;part I of his interview with a system cracker.
</p><p>
If programming is more up your alley, check out Reuven M.
Lerner's column this month. Now that Ruby on Rails is at version 3, you
probably want to know what that means if you're a Ruby programmer.
Reuven describes what's new, what's the same, and why you might care either
way. Additionally, Dave Taylor teaches us more about shell scripting, again
with a really fun project. If you've ever played <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mad
Libs</em></span>, you know
it can be fun. In fact, if you follow along with Dave, you might not
even realize you're learning as you go, because <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mad
Libs</em></span> can be wildly
entertaining.
</p><p>
We've also got product reviews, like Bill Childer's review of the NOOKcolor
(which he totally hacked and tells us how to do the same). It's a
great way to get a decent tablet at a cheap price, and also read some books
along the way. Mike Diehl follows, showing application creation with
Radical Breeze's Illumination Software Creator. For those of you who don't
actually like to write code, Mike has just the programming framework for
you.
</p><p>
As for me, I'm going to read Chuck Elliot's article on programming
Bluetooth devices. I see half the population walking around with Bluetooth
earpieces attached to their heads. If I can just reprogram them to emit
subliminal messages to their hosts, I can have a zombie army in no time!
MWAHAHAHA!
</p><p>
Oh, right. Turn off the late night sci-fi and get this issue in the mail.
Done and done. Enjoy!
