Think Java's the only game in town when it comes to programming Android
apps? Think again.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ee580.0x23e6358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Mobile app development for smartphones is hot. This is no more prevalent
than in the Android space where the activity level oftentimes
is frenzied. However, when it comes to building a &ldquo;real&rdquo; Android app,
it seems there's only one programming choice: Java (although it is
possible with a lot more work to use C/C++ with Android's Native
Development Kit). That said, Google wisely chose the popular Java
programming technology upon which to base its Android SDK, which runs
a customized VM.
</p><p>
By and large, this has been a smart strategy, as (unlike another popular
smartphone) there's no need to own specific hardware and software
to get started with app development on Android. All you need is a PC
(or laptop) running Linux, Windows or Mac OS X, together with a copy of
Java and the free Android SDK. Google provides emulator downloads for
all the Android platform releases, and there's even a free plugin for
Eclipse to start you off and point you in the right direction.
</p><p>
That's great&mdash;assuming, of course, you're a fan of Java. If, like me,
you'd rather eat glass than sit down to write some Java code in Eclipse,
it would appear that you are out of luck when it comes to implementing
your next project on Android. But, this is not the case. There's a rather
wonderful project called the Scripting Layer for Android (SL4A) that
is bringing scripting languages to the Android platform and providing
a working alternative to Java development.
</p><p>
In this article, I walk through the steps involved in preparing
your computer for Android development with SL4A, then show how
to write, test and run a simple script written in Python on your
Android device.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ee580.0x23e66c8"></a>
Introducing SL4A</h2></div></div><p>
The Scripting Layer for Android is one of the many projects to see
life as a direct result of Google's policy of allocating 20% of its
employees' time to &ldquo;pet projects&rdquo;. Damon Kohler works for Google, and
he created SL4A to scratch his own itch when it came to programming
Android. SL4A provides a high-level interface to Android's underlying
Java technologies, exposing a subset of the API to scripting languages.
</p><p>
Python was one of the first languages to be supported on SL4A, but
contributed interpreters also are available for Perl, JRuby, Lua, BeanShell,
JavaScript and Tcl. In its default state, SL4A comes pre-installed
with a working version of the shell. SL4A's API is designed to be
portable across scripting languages, so if you like what you see in this
article but wish I'd used Perl instead of Python, the API calls I
use here should work exactly as shown with the Perl interpreter. It's true
that I'm very much a fan of Perl, but I'm equally comfortable in Python,
and, as Python is the SL4A &ldquo;standard&rdquo;, I stick with Python throughout
this article. Just be aware that you don't have to.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ee580.0x23e68d8"></a>
Getting Ready</h2></div></div><p>
To get started, you need a copy of the Android SDK running on your computer,
and you need a Java VM. Although you aren't going to program your
Android app with Java, you still need a Java runtime upon which to
execute the Android emulator, which is part of the SDK. The inclusion
of the Android emulator gives you a sandboxed testbed to play in while
you create your app.
</p><p>
Before proceeding, you need to make sure a Java VM is installed on your
Linux system. On my system (running a recent Xubuntu), I entered the
following commands and was told neither program was
available to me:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ javac -version
$ java -version
</pre>
</p><p>
Xubuntu suggested that I might like to use apt-get to install
openjdk-6-jdk, which sounded reasonable to me, so that's what I did:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo apt-get openjdk-6-jdk
</pre>
</p><p>
If you are running a distro that's not derived from Debian,
search your software repository for a similar package and install
it before proceeding.
</p><p>
With Java in place, it's now time to get the Android SDK. Downloads of
the SDK are available for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux. Pop on over to
Google's Android Developer site (see Resources) and grab the latest SDK
tarball for Linux.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ee580.0x23e6bf0"></a>
Installing the Android SDK</h2></div></div><p>
With the SDK downloaded, simply unpack the tarball within a directory
of your choice (the filename you have may be different from the one 
I use here, but don't worry, yours is likely a later version of the SDK):

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar zxvf android-sdk_r07-linux_x86.tgz
</pre>
</p><p>
This command created a new directory called android-sdk-linux_x86,
which I renamed to Android. This newly created directory has a
bunch of subdirectories within it. Don't be overwhelmed by all the
stuff that's in there. Only one subdirectory is of interest to you at
this stage, and it's called tools.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ee580.0x23e6da8"></a>
Preparing the Android Emulator</h2></div></div><p>
Within the tools directory, only two programs are of interest to
you. The adb utility allows you to transfer files to (and from)
your Android emulator (more on this utility later). The android
tool lets you prepare and run an emulator for any number of the current
Android releases, and that's what you do next:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd Android/tools
$ ./android
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >android</tt> command starts the Android SDK and AVD
Manager,
which is a tool that creates Android emulators for any number of Android
virtual devices. At the moment, there are no virtual devices, so you
need to create one. However, before this can happen, you need to install a
target Android API package. To do that, click on the Installed Packages
tab, then press the Update All button. In the dialog that appears,
click Accept All and then press the Install button.
</p><p>
The resulting download takes a while, so drag yourself away from
your computer and head off into the kitchen to make a nice cup of
coffee. Depending on your download speed, you may have time to make
a quick sandwich too.
</p><p>
With the download(s) complete, let's create an Android Virtual Device
(AVD). An AVD is a virtual version of an Android device that you can run
on the emulator. Select the Virtual Devices tab, then click on the New
button. A dialog appears that you can use to set the characteristics
of your AVD. Figure 1 shows that I've given my AVD a name (LJapp),
selected an API target (API Level 7, which is Android 2.1) and set my
virtual SD card to 256 meg. When you have made your selections, click on
the Create AVD button to initialize your AVD.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10940f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Setting the defaults for your emulated Android virtual device.
</p></div></div><p>
If you return to the Virtual Devices tab, your LJapp AVD now should 
exist. Select the AVD and press the Start button, then select the Launch
button from the displayed dialog. The emulator starts to load, and after a
few seconds, you see the opening screen for your emulated Android device
(Figure 2). Note that the emulator runs much more slowly than the actual
physical phone, so it may take a while to get to the Android startup
screen. Your mileage will vary, depending on the speed of your desktop's
processor.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10940f2.large.jpg"><img src="10940f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Your Android emulator is ready.
</p></div></div><p>
Note: throughout the remainder of this article, I use the word
&ldquo;tap&rdquo;
to refer to using the mouse to click within the emulator. There is no
mouse pointer on your physical Android device (that's what your finger is
for), but the emulator needs something, so the mouse pointer
&ldquo;emulates&rdquo;
your finger, hence the use of the word tap to describe the action
required. When you see me use the word tap, think click.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ee580.0x23e7538"></a>
Installing SL4A</h2></div></div><p>
Getting the SL4A on your emulator is
straightforward. Start by tapping the Android browser and surfing to
the SL4A Web site:
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting" target="_self">code.google.com/p/android-scripting</a>.
</p><p>
When the SL4A Web page appears, tap on the square graphic (the QR
Code) to access the download URL for SL4A. The download should begin
immediately, and once it completes, tap the downloaded package name
(which is sl4a_r3.apk at the time of this writing) to install SL4A.
Go ahead and tap on the Install button, then tap on the Open button to
start the app. You'll be asked to participate in usage tracking (it's
up to you, and it's optional), and then SL4A informs you that you have
&ldquo;No matches found&rdquo; under your Scripts listing. That's okay; you've yet to
install any scripts. SL4A now is ready for Python.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ee580.0x23e7748"></a>
Installing Python for Android</h2></div></div><p>
Return to the Android browser and double-tap the screen to enlarge the
Web page. Locate the Featured Downloads part of the page on the right, and
tap on the download arrow beside the python_for_android_r1.apk
link. As before, let the download complete before tapping on the
downloaded file to install it. When you're ready, tap the Install button
to confirm the installation of the interpreter. When this completes,
tap on the Open button, then tap on the big Install button to complete
the installation. The Python for Android app downloads, extracts and
installs the Python support files from the SL4A Web site and adds them
into SL4A. The entire process should take only a minute or two to
complete. If it takes longer than a few minutes, take a deep breath,
and remember that the emulator is much slower than your physical device.
</p><p>
When the installation completes, you'll be presented with an Uninstall
button. Don't tap this button! If you do, you'll remove the Python
interpreter that you've just installed. Instead, tap on the
emulator's home button (the little house icon) to return to the Android
main screen, tap the tab at the bottom of the screen to see the list
of installed apps, and note that SL4A has been added to your emulator
(Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10940f3.large.jpg"><img src="10940f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Your Android emulator has SL4A installed and is ready for action.
</p></div></div><p>
Go ahead and tap the SL4A icon that now displays the list of installed
Python scripts. Tapping the hello_world.py script pops up the SL4A run
menu (Figure 4). Looking from left to right, the menu icons have
the following meaning: 1) run the script at the Python shell, which is useful
when debugging; 2) run the script &ldquo;natively&rdquo;; 3) edit the script
in SL4A's built-in text editor, which is useful only for the most trivial of
changes; 4) rename the script; and 5) delete the script. To 
test your installation quickly, tap the second menu icon, which I like to refer
to as the &ldquo;run wheel&rdquo;. After a second or two, a message saying
&ldquo;Hello,
Android!&rdquo; appears on screen for a few seconds then disappears.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10940f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. SL4A Menu Icons
</p></div></div><p>
If that worked, tap the test.py script, then tap the run wheel. This runs
a longer-running script that showcases some of the facilities available
to you as a Python programmer working on Android. Again, bear in mind
that the emulator runs slowly, so be patient and wait for the various
Android interface elements to appear.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ee580.0x27e0020"></a>
Creating Scripts for Android</h2></div></div><p>
Your Android emulator now is ready to run your custom Python script,
so let's create one. Before you do though, note that the published SL4A
API is a subset of the full Android API, so certain features either
are not available, in the process of being made available or fully supported
(see Resources for a link to the current list). Don't let this put you
off. What's there is more than enough to produce usable Android apps
in Python.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ee580.0x27e0128"></a>
A Sample Script</h2></div></div><p>
To get a feel for Python running on SL4A, let's port an existing script
to the phone. The script in question is based on some code from Chapter
2 of O'Reilly Media's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Head First Programming</em></span>, which I cowrote with
David Griffiths in 2009. This simple script connects to the Web site of a
fictitious company called Beans'R'Us to grab the company's home page and
extract the current price of coffee beans from the page's HTML. The code
is straightforward, grabbing the HTML page from the server, searching for
the pricing data, extracting it from the HTML page and then displaying
it on screen:


<pre     class="programlisting">
from urllib import urlencode
from urllib2 import urlopen

pg = urlopen("http://www.beans-r-us.biz/prices.html")

text = pg.read().decode("utf8") 
where = text.find('&gt;$') 
start_of_price = where + 2 
end_of_price = start_of_price + 4 
price = float(text[start_of_price:end_of_price])

print "The current price of coffee is:", price
</pre>
</p><p>
This is Python 2 code, which is a deliberate choice, as the Python
that comes with SL4A is the 2.6.2 release. To take this program for
a spin, either load it into Python's IDLE tool or execute it from the
command line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ python LJapp-cmd.py 
The current price of coffee is: 5.52
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, this small script displays the currently published price
of coffee beans.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ee580.0x27e0440"></a>
Porting the Sample Script to Android</h2></div></div><p>
Turning this script into an Android app is just a matter of deciding on
the Android UI elements you want to use, as the core functionality
does not need to change. The Python on SL4A is fully functional, so the
facilities you are used to with standard Python also are available on
your smartphone.
</p><p>
To make this script more Android-like, let's display a friendly message
on startup as well as one on exit. The makeToast() API call provides
this functionality.
</p><p>
The dialogCreateSpinnerProgress() API call lets you display an Android
spinner dialog, assuming you then remember to call the dialogShow()
API call to make it visible. Let's display a spinner prior to requesting
the Web page from the Beans'R'Us server, then dismiss the spinner dialog
with the dialogDismiss() API call, once we have the data processed. And,
let's vibrate the phone at this point too, just for the fun of it.
</p><p>
To conclude the script, use the dialogCreateAlert(), dialogSetItems()
and dialogSetPositiveButtonText() API calls to display the price of
beans within an Android dialog. To exit, simply tap the OK button.
</p><p>
Here's the Python code from earlier with the calls to the SL4A API
added in:


<pre     class="programlisting">
import android

from urllib import urlencode
from urllib2 import urlopen

app = android.Android()

app.makeToast("Hello from LJapp")

appTitle = "LJapp"
appMsg = "Checking the price of coffee..."

app.dialogCreateSpinnerProgress(appTitle, appMsg)
app.dialogShow()

pg = urlopen("http://www.beans-r-us.biz/prices.html")
text = pg.read().decode("utf8") 
where = text.find('&gt;$') 
start_of_price = where + 2 
end_of_price = start_of_price + 4 
price = float(text[start_of_price:end_of_price])

app.dialogDismiss()
app.vibrate()

appMsg = "The current price of coffee beans:"

app.dialogCreateAlert(appMsg)
app.dialogSetItems([price])
app.dialogSetPositiveButtonText('OK')
app.dialogShow()
resp = app.dialogGetResponse().result

app.makeToast("Bye!")
</pre>
</p><p>
Other than the addition of the Android UI code, no other
changes are required to the code from earlier, other than removing the
earlier script's call to print (which is no longer required).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ee580.0x27e0808"></a>
Transferring Your Script to the Emulator</h2></div></div><p>
To transfer your Python script to the emulator for testing, copy your code
file into your Android directory, then use the adb utility within
the tools directory to push your file to the SL4A scripts directory on
the emulator:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tools/adb push LJapp.py /sdcard/sl4a/scripts
6 KB/s (748 bytes in 0.116s)
</pre>
</p><p>
With the file transferred, check the list of scripts within SL4A and
notice the addition of LJapp.py near the top of the list.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ee580.0x27e09c0"></a>
Testing Your Script</h2></div></div><p>
Go on, tap your app name, then tap the run wheel. After a moment, you
should see the spinner dialog appear while your script contacts the
Beans'R'Us Web site and requests the current price of coffee (Figure 5).
Shortly thereafter, the current price appears in another
dialog (Figure 6). Congratulations! The script has been ported
to your Android virtual device.

Running on a Smartphone</h2></div></div><p>
To run a Python script on your physical Android device, install SL4A
together with Python for Android on your handset, then transfer your
script.
</p><p>
To install SL4A on your physical Android device, enable the Unknown
Sources option in your device's Application settings. This setting is
required to enable the installation of non-Market apps on your phone. With
this done, you can follow the same steps you used when installing SL4A
and Python on your emulator. To speed things up a little, install Barcode
Scanner from the Android Market and use it to &ldquo;read&rdquo; the QR Codes from
your desktop screen.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ee580.0x27e1048"></a>
Transferring Your Script to Your Handset</h2></div></div><p>
There are a number of ways to get your script onto a real phone. I've
found the success of using something like Bluetooth connectivity or USB
cabling arrangements can very much depend on the hardware on which you're
running. What works on one handset, doesn't on another, and so on. Your
mileage may vary depending on your actual device. When I need to transfer
a file, I've come to rely on a solution that works no matter which handset
I use (as long as the handset can talk to a local Wi-Fi network). What
I do is switch on the OpenSSH server on my development PC running Linux,
then use the AndFTP file transfer app on the handset to
<tt  >scp</tt> files
from the desktop to the phone. AndFTP is available from the Android
Market as a free download and installs in minutes. Once I connect to my
desktop with AndFTP, I can navigate to a directory of my choice, mark
the files that I want, then download them to my SD card on the handset.
</p><p>
AndFTP works well, and I've come to depend on it for all my Android
file transfers (see Resources). Just be sure to transfer your scripts
to /sdcard/sl4a/scripts on the phone to ensure that your script
names appear within the SL4A list of scripts.
</p><p>
With your script file transferred to your physical device, start SL4A as
before, tap your app's name and tap the run wheel. As expected, your app
runs just as it did on the emulator, only faster! I haven't included a
screenshot of the app running on a real phone for two reasons. First,
it looks exactly the same as it did in the emulator, and second, it's
running on your device, so you can take a look at it there!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ee580.0x27e1258"></a>
Creating an APK</h2></div></div><p>
There's one further kink to SL4A that might interest you. The project
includes draft instructions on creating a standalone, downloadable
Android APK package (see Resources). Once created, the APK file bundles
your custom Python script with information that allows other Android users
to install Python for Android automatically onto their handsets and then
run your app from the smartphone's main menu of apps. Describing the
process of creating the APK likely would take another article, so I
leave it to the brave among you to try out the instructions on the SL4A
Wiki.
To see and learn a little about one such successfully created APK,
check out Split Hitter on the Web (see Resources).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ee580.0x27e1360"></a>
Final Words</h2></div></div><p>
Programming your app in Java is not the only option on Android. With SL4A,
very capable scripting languages come to Android, taking the platform to
a new level of hackability. If you can, get involved. More people means
more eyeballs, and more eyeballs means more help and more code. Official
support from Google will come if enough programmers get involved, which
can only help raise the project's profile within Google's HQ. SL4A
is already a good project, and I can only imagine the great project it
will be with &ldquo;official status&rdquo; bestowed on it by Google. Let's hope this
happens sooner rather than later.
</p><p>
You can learn lots more from the wiki documentation hosted at the SL4A
Web site. Be sure to browse the Tutorials section of the wiki for links
to what others are doing with SL4A. There's also an active (and very
friendly) SL4A mailing list that Damon uses to announce new versions,
track feature requests, report patches and spread the word about SL4A. If
you build an app for Android using SL4A, join the list, and I'll see
you there.
