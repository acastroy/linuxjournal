Klaus Goelker's <span   class="emphasis"><em>GIMP 2.6 for Photographers</em></span> (Rocky Nook)</h2></div></div><p>
Kiss Photoshop goodbye and go GIMP with Klaus Goelker's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>GIMP 2.6 for
Photographers: Image Editing with Open Source Software</em></span>, published by
Rocky Nook. The GIMP is
an open-source image editing tool for Linux, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows that
provides a free alternative to expensive programs, such as Photoshop. Goelker's
book for beginners will take the reader from a sorry, unenlightened state
directly to GIMP nirvana, covering topics, such as the basics of image editing,
layers and masks, stitching panoramic images and preparing high-quality
black-and-white images. The book follows a workshop format and has evolved from
classroom materials that the author developed and taught in courses on image
editing with the GIMP.

Sarath Lakshman's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Shell Scripting Cookbook</em></span> (Packt
Publishing)</h2></div></div><p>
Scripting on a Linux/UNIX box is like playing an instrument. Okay, Sarath
Lakshman says its more like cooking, and now that he has a new book out,
called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Shell Scripting Cookbook</em></span>, he gets to choose the metaphor.
Regardless of whose metaphor you like, you may want to pick up Lakshman's book
to master the powerful Linux shell scripting language, your tool for
controlling the entire operating system. Written in a cookbook style, the aim
of the book is to boil the lengthy man pages down into essential
command-line recipes that cover most Linux commands and offer a variety of
use cases and examples. Some of the many complex data manipulations covered
include text processing, file management, backups and more. Utilities, such as
sed, awk, grep and cut, also are covered.

ADLINK Technology's Ampro CoreModule 745</h2></div></div><p>
The newest small-form-factor, rugged single-board computer from ADLINK is the
Ampro CoreModule 745. This stackable PC/104-Plus SBC allows OEMs in military,
avionics, transportation and other rugged markets to add a state-of-the-art
Intel architecture controller to their systems without the need for a custom
carrier board. The module supports a range of Intel Atom processors, from the
power-efficient N450 running at 1.66GHz to the performance-oriented dual-core
D510. The Atom's two-chip solution architecture with integrated memory and
graphics controllers permit excellent performance with very low power
requirements. With a TDP as low as 9W, the CoreModule 745 simplifies cooling
requirements and enables conduction-cooled solutions for small sealed
enclosures in space-constrained applications.

Opera Browser</h2></div></div><p>
Could the longtime cult-favorite browser Opera finally make the big time
with its new version 11? The company says that Opera 11 is big&mdash;a browser
that, besides adding a layer of polish to features users have known and loved
for a decade, will &ldquo;change everything you know about browsing&rdquo;. The
key new features include tab stacking, numerous new extensions and visual
mouse gestures. Tab stacking is a novel way to organize open tabs.

gestures allow browsing commands via a flick of the wrist. Opera 11, with its

platforms.
