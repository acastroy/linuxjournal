Using shell scripts to re-create this classic grammar game. 
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21f9580.0x22f1408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
My son is at the age when he's decomposing sentences, diagramming them
and learning about the parts of speech. Me? I couldn't differentiate
between an adverb and an adjective if a wet, smelly red ball smacked me in
the head. That's why I have an editor! 
</p><p>
There are games for everything, however, and one of the best games for
learning the parts of speech is a simple one that's been around since I
was a kid: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mad Libs</em></span>. You know what I'm talking about, it takes simple
sentences like:
&ldquo;When my dog is happy, he jumps and barks, his tail wagging a mile a
minute.&rdquo;
and transforms them into:
&ldquo;When my [ noun ] is [ adjective ], he [ verb ] and
[ verb ], his [ noun ] wagging a mile a [ noun ].&rdquo;
</p><p>
The question is, can we write a shell script that can perform this sort of
transformation? The answer, of course, is yes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21f9580.0x22f17d0"></a>
Identifying Parts of Speech</h2></div></div><p>
There are two challenges with this project: figuring out which words to
replace with their parts of speech and figuring out the part of speech of
a given word.
Let's tackle these in reverse order.
</p><p>
It turns out that a number of different Web sites let you look
up a word and offer its definition and part of speech. The one I use for
this exercise 
is from Princeton, because it's fast, easy to parse and easy to submit
queries.
</p><p>
To look up the part of speech of, say, &ldquo;dog&rdquo;, the URL to invoke is
simply <a href="http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=dog" target="_self">wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=dog</a>.
</p><p>
The result highlights the part of speech as an h3 line, so isolating that
element is a breeze:

<pre     class="programlisting">

curl --silent "lookup$word" | grep '&lt;h3&gt;'

</pre>
</p><p>
This particular word demonstrates one of the nuances of the problem: many
words have more than one part of speech, demonstrated by the difference
between a pet dog and someone who is dogging your every footstep. Sure
enough, the result:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;h3&gt;Noun&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Verb&lt;/h3&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
For simplicity's sake, let's just take the first match, easily done by
adding <tt  >| head -1</tt> to the pipe. Next, let's drop it all into
lowercase and strip out the HTML:


<pre     class="programlisting">

| tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/&lt;h3&gt;//;s/&lt;\/h3&gt;//'

</pre>
</p><p>
Both of these are worth a bit of explanation. You might well have seen
<tt  >tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'</tt> as the more common way to
transliterate uppercase to lowercase, and that works just fine, if you're
working in English. Using the character sets &ldquo;:upper:&rdquo; and
&ldquo;:lower:&rdquo; is a more portable alternative that's preferred.
</p><p>
The sed command also lets you specify more than one command
argument to apply by simply separating them with a semicolon. What we have
here is a substitution of &lt;h3&gt; to a null string (for example, removing it),
followed by the same thing for &lt;/h3&gt;.
</p><p>
That's all we need to get the part of speech. For example:


<pre     class="programlisting">

$ lookup="http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s="
$ word="happy"
$ curl --silent "$lookup$word" | grep '&lt;h3&gt;' |
  tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/&lt;h3&gt;//;s/&lt;\/h3&gt;//'
adjective

</pre>
</p><p>
And, the hard part's done!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21f9580.0x22f2068"></a>
Choosing Words to Replace</h2></div></div><p>
For this article, let's use a replacement density constant to
figure out whether any given word should be replaced. The higher the
density, the more likely a given word in the input stream will be
replaced by its part of speech.
</p><p>
This is lazy and not a great solution, because it can match
&ldquo;is&rdquo; or
&ldquo;the&rdquo; just as easily as &ldquo;dog&rdquo; or
&ldquo;tail&rdquo;, but
let's go with it for now to get a sense of how it'll all fit
together. We'll come back to it and improve the sophistication of the
selection criteria later. With me? Good!
</p><p>
For a given word, deciding whether to substitute its part of speech can be
calculated as follows, assuming we have a variable called density
that has a nonzero integer value:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $(( $RANDOM % $density )) = 1 ] ; then
</pre>
</p><p>
$RANDOM is one of those cool magic variables in the Bourne shell that has a
different value each time you reference it&mdash;handy!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21f9580.0x22f2488"></a>
Putting Things Together</h2></div></div><p>
Let's put these together and see what we get. We'll use an
initial density of 5, which theoretically should mean that if we have a
properly random $RANDOM, each word should have a 1:5 chance of being
replaced.
</p><p>
The script needs to read the input word by word, testing each word as it
goes. This can be done easily with the following loop structure, assuming
that the text input comes from stdin:

<pre     class="programlisting">
while read sentence ; do
  for word in $sentence ; do
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, we add the random conditional and have a skeleton ready to test:


<pre     class="programlisting">
while read sentence ; do
  for word in $sentence ; do
    if [ $(( $RANDOM % $density )) -eq 1 ] ; then
      echo "(($word))"
    else
      echo $word
    fi
  done
done
</pre>
</p><p>
You can see that at this stage we're going to output the words
we're planning on replacing with &ldquo;(())&rdquo;. Here's a quick test:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo this is a test mad-lib input | sh make-madlib.sh
this
is
((a))
test
((mad-lib))
input
</pre>
</p><p>
One tiny tweak before I wrap it up for the month&mdash;how do we get the words
to appear on the same line? It's easy. Remember that each of the code loops
is
essentially a little script of its own, so this task can be accomplished
by adding four characters to the very end of the outermost loop:

<pre     class="programlisting">
done
done | fmt
</pre>
</p><p>
That's all you have to do&mdash;add the <tt  >|fmt</tt> after the second
done statement. Now when it's run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo this is a test mad-lib input | sh make-madlib.sh
this is a ((test)) ((mad-lib)) input
</pre>
</p><p>
Next month, we'll add the part of speech lookup code into the
conditional and then spend some time exploring a more sophisticated word
choice algorithm. Clearly, random isn't as beneficial.
