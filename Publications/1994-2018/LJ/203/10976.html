Sweet Home 3D&mdash;Interactive Home Design
(<a href="http://www.sweethome3d.com" target="_self">www.sweethome3d.com</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
This nifty program caused quite a storm at SourceForge.net some time ago,
but now that the publicity has died down, I'd like to put it
back in the spotlight. As an unusually easy-to-use 3-D design program,
this is a project I've wanted to cover for some time.
</p><p>
To quote the Web site:
&ldquo;Sweet Home 3D is a free interior design application that helps you place
your furniture on a house 2-D plan, with a 3-D preview.&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10976f1.large.jpg"><img src="10976f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
As soon as you start drawing walls on your blueprint, the house
starts taking shape in the pane below it.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10976f2.large.jpg"><img src="10976f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
An example file for new users shows off some design possibilities,
such as trees and a swimming pool.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10976f3.large.jpg"><img src="10976f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
If you export as a picture, Sweet Home 3D can enhance the image greatly. Here's a
spectacular design, copyright Whippetsleek.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
As far as library requirements go, I couldn't find much in the documentation
aside from Java and working OpenGL drivers. However, even Java might not
really be needed, as there's a Java Runtime Environment folder contained
in the given tarball, so perhaps Sweet Home 3D will run without it being locally
installed.
</p><p>
When it actually comes to downloading and running Sweet Home 3D, this is
one of
the easiest program I've come across. Go to the Web site and head to
the Download section. There you'll find a choice of 32-bit and 64-bit
tarballs, with a source tarball also available at the bottom of the page.
</p><p>
Download the appropriate tarball for your system and extract it. In
most modern file managers, you should be able to enter the new
folder and click on the SweetHome3D file to run the program. However,
if that doesn't work, open a terminal in the new folder, and enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./SweetHome3D
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Before I continue, I should mention that the Web site has a fantastic video
tutorial that will unlock the working ideals of this program very
quickly. The first thing it recommends is starting off with a
blueprint image, and you then can draw over the top of it. You don't
<span   class="emphasis"><em>need</em></span> one, but seriously, get one if you can.
</p><p>
To use the blueprint, from the main menu, choose Plan&rarr;Import background
image. Choose the picture you want to import, and next you need to
define the physical size from one end of the house to the other. You need
the house's measurements for this, and there's a blue line below, which you 
drag onto one end of the house to the other. Although the default choice
is in centimeters, it can be changed either to meters or millimeters,
or you can set it to use the imperial system.
</p><p>
Next, you need to &ldquo;Define the origin of the image, by clicking in
its location below&rdquo;. See that blue thing in the top-left corner? Drag
it over to the top-left corner of the house (you may want to maximize
this window to place it more accurately).
</p><p>
Once you've made your way through these dialogs, choose the Create
walls button, and click on the edge of a wall in the blueprints to start
drawing. Each click you make defines a corner and allows the wall to
change direction. When you reach the end of a wall, such as an archway
for instance, either double-click or press the Esc button. Click the
mouse again at the start of the next wall to resume the process. As you
draw walls over the 2-D image, you'll see a 3-D house begin to take shape
in the pane below it.
</p><p>
Doors and windows can be dragged from the pane on the left
to the main plans on the right. Sweet Home 3D is exceedingly clever at working
out how long a door or window should be, as well as which way it should
open&mdash;the program actually works it out on the fly as you hover your mouse over
different sections of the house. Even if you get the placement wrong,
each object has its own mini-UI for readjusting the placement.
</p><p>
The Create rooms button allows you to define individual rooms within the
house (cleverly independent of whether walls are there to define
the area). This function's main use is really for things like texture and
color, where one room can have different walls and flooring from another.
</p><p>
The left pane also has a selection of household items, such as chairs,
washing machines and so on. If you're copying the layout of your own house,
this is a great tool for testing out how a new item is likely to 
fit or look in your room before you actually buy it.
</p><p>
The coolest feature is that the bottom pane on the right actually
lets you fly around your house using the mouse wheel or arrow keys, and
you even can take snapshots or record a video.
</p><p>
Ultimately, Sweet Home 3D was designed by passionate people who knew what
they were doing. The UI takes certain liberties in 3-D design controls,
fast-tracking you with areas that will make a house and leaving out some
unnecessary clutter that often makes 3-D design a complete headache. This
is one cool project.

GNOME Chemistry Utils
(<a href="http://gchemutils.nongnu.org" target="_self">gchemutils.nongnu.org</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
Unlike the majority of projects I review, this one actually is a set
of multiple programs, presented as one suite. Whether you're into
crystalline structures or designing chemical molecules, this may be the
project you're looking for.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10976f4.large.jpg"><img src="10976f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
An excellent tool for any scientist, GChemTable provides not only a
table of elements, but also a whole swag of info about each element.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10976f5.large.jpg"><img src="10976f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
From the Web site, a great example of using the chemical 
viewer.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Available at the Web site are source tarballs for both the stable and
development versions, and older versions are available in distro
repositories. I ran into compiling problems with the development
version, so I went with the stable version. Library requirements are
quite extensive. According to the documentation,
&ldquo;to compile and use the GNOME Chemistry Utils, you need libglade-2,
goffice, GtkGLExt, OpenBabel, BODR and their own dependencies. Everything
except OpenBabel is available from the GNOME repository or one of its
mirrors.&rdquo;
</p><p>
I found a few more needed libraries, from both the configure and make
stages. Although listed above, libgoffice, libopenbabel and libgtkglext1 all
needed their development (-dev) packages installed to continue. Other
needed packages were libgsf-1 and its -dev, libgcu0 and its -dbg,
and chemical_mime_data.
</p><p>
Assuming you have the tarball, extract it and open a terminal in the
new folder. From here, it's the standard fare of:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure
$ make
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro uses sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro uses root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ su 
# make install
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
As mentioned before, this is a suite of utilities rather than just one,
so I take a brief look at each utility here. Below each utility's
title, I provide the shell command to run the program. 
Unfortunately, partway
through reviewing this suite, I managed to &ldquo;break&rdquo; several utilities,
seemingly beyond repair. No matter which files I wiped, or how
many re-installations I tried, I couldn't get the programs working
again. Therefore, reviews will be brief (and possibly theoretical).
</p><p>
GChemCalc:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gchemcalc
</pre>
</p><p>
&ldquo;GChemCalc is a simple calculator for chemists&rdquo;, according to the
About page. Below the main menu is a field for entering formulae, and
GChemCalc will try to interpret the symbols you enter, either by atom
or nickname. Once the formula is entered, its raw formula form will
be written below, as well as its molecular weight. In the main field,
the composition will be displayed according to each element along with
its percentage of mass.
</p><p>
Click on the Isotopic Pattern tab, and you can see the monoisotopic
mass as a direct number and also displayed in a line graph, which can be
exported as an image.
</p><p>
GChemPaint:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gchempaint
</pre>
</p><p>
I got far enough to realize that structures you build in this program
can be used by most of the other programs. I'd just attempted to
re-create an LSD molecule from the Wikipedia diagram, but the program
crashed when I saved it as an .mdl file.
</p><p>
To start designing molecules, pick an object from the tool window, such
as Add a four membered cycle, and you now can &ldquo;draw&rdquo; in the white
workspace. Click and <span   class="emphasis"><em>hold</em></span> the mouse, and if you move the mouse
around, the still-colored object will rotate until you release the mouse
button, then the object will go black and stay in place. Although its
operation seems somewhat arbitrary, moving forward and backward with
the mouse will make the object larger or smaller (although you might need
some perseverance to get it working).
</p><p>
As far as symbols and their placement, something like C or N will
update its appropriate symbols as you continue to expand on the molecule,
balancing itself out (as far as I can tell anyway, I'm not a chemist).
</p><p>
Once you have a structure you're happy with, you can open it in
GChem3D, allowing you to see it as an actual 3-D structure, instead of
bland 2-D lines.
</p><p>
Something I'd have liked to explore more was a button marked:
&ldquo;Export for Wikipedia publication&rdquo;. I'm guessing that gets used a lot.
</p><p>
GChem3D:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gchem3d
</pre>
</p><p>
Unfortunately, I killed GChem3D when opening a bad file (the first of the
casualties) and didn't get a chance to take it for a test run. The
man file says: &ldquo;gchem3d is a small chemical viewer application, which
can show several chemical file formats&rdquo;. From what I can tell from the
other documentation, this takes place in an OpenGL 3-D window, letting
you rotate and interact with each structure, as well as customize the
visual atomic representation.
</p><p>
Gnome Crystal:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gcrystal
</pre>
</p><p>
According to the man file, &ldquo;gcrystal is a light model visualizer for
crystal structures, based on the GNOME Chemistry Utils, that displays
models of all sorts of crystal microscopic structures using OpenGL&rdquo;.
Although
I didn't break this program, I couldn't make sense of it as a layman;
however, the concept appears to be similar to that of GChem3D, but for
viewing and editing crystalline forms rather than viewing molecular
structures.
</p><p>
GChemTable:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gchemtable
</pre>
</p><p>
This gives you a periodic table of elements that has a great database
of information available for each element. Click on an element, and you'll
be given four tabs. The first, Main, consists of the element's name
(which is also translated into several other languages on the right),
the atomic number, atomic weight and electronic configuration. The
other tabs give you the electronic properties, radii and thermodynamics.
</p><p>
GSpectrum:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gspectrum
</pre>
</p><p>
According to the man file, &ldquo;gspectrum is a simple spectrum visualizer. It
is only able to display files in the JCAMP-DX format&rdquo;. This was another
casualty of mine, but it appears to display JCAMP
spectra on a basic X-Y scale.
</p><p>
This was the unluckiest month I've had at <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>. I think I went
through a dozen programs that wouldn't work before I came across these
two projects. Although half the programs in this suite died on me (in
a way I've never encountered before), I'm sure distro-stable versions
will be a lot more reliable. Bad luck aside, the GNOME Chemistry Utils
suite seems to provide viewing, access and editing to some file types
that are used in important scientific circles. That alone
is worth this project's perseverance.
