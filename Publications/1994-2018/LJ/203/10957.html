Well Done!</h4><p>
I have only had broadband Internet recently, so am still discovering the
best places therein. Chance brought me to your site today, and that was it.
Hooked. Not only is the content interesting (if often essentially a
pointer), but the site itself is excellent. Clean, <span   class="emphasis"><em>legible</em></span>, well
structured&mdash;congrats.


<br><br>&mdash;<br>

We're glad to have you! There are many people in my area here in northern
Michigan who still have dial-up. Once you have broadband, it's hard to imagine
life without it! Have fun.&mdash;Ed.

Slackware Linux?</h4><p>
I've been using Linux for years now and just recently obtained a
subscription to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>&mdash;great magazine! I
started out using Ubuntu,
but I have advanced my Linux arsenal and have been using Slackware for
almost over a year! It's definitely not for the faint of heart, but it's a
solid OS and very true to the Linux spirit. I wanted to suggest
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> possibly
include more information on this Guru-targeted OS for some of us who are
less fortunate!
Regardless, keep up the good work!

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Michael Griffith  <br><br>
</p><p>
We'll see what we can do. Slackware truly is an awesome distribution, but like
you said, it's not for the faint of heart. I can't promise we'll have more
Slackware-specific stuff, but we'll try to remember Slackware users in our
articles.&mdash;Ed.

Two Minor Corrections</h4><p>
I just wanted to write in to make a couple minor corrections that may have confused
some beginners.
</p><p>
The first one is in Kyle Rankin's review of the Chinavision Pico Projector in the
November 2010 issue. He stated that port 21 was open in the Linux operating system
of the device and wondered if telnet actually had been enabled. Port 21 is actually
for FTP; telnet is port 23. This could have been a typo or just an oversight, but
I wanted to clear up any confusion readers may have had.
</p><p>
In Part IV of Mick Bauer's &ldquo;Building a Transparent Firewall with
Linux&rdquo; series in the
December 2010 issue, he states that iptables ignores inter-VLAN traffic and
describes that as being traffic between different ports within the same VLAN.
Traffic within the same VLAN is actually intra-VLAN rather than inter-VLAN. This is
similar to the difference between an intranet and an Internet, of course.
</p><p>
Again, these are minor and pale in comparison to the enormous level of great
content <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> publishes every month. Keep up the good work.

Generating Turn-by-Turn Driving Directions</h4><p>
Today I got a chance to mess around with Dave Taylor's script in the December 2010
issue. Although I'm new to using curl, sed and lynx, the driving directions
application in the article gave me some leads to study while using the Bash shell.
</p><p>
Thanks very much for a such a nifty script. After customizing the script as
suggested by Dave, I've got it accessible from a directory structure I use for my
scripts, so it's now a great addition to my listings. My other small change to the
script was to send the output to a desktop.txt file on my desktop, so I could
print it out before leaving the house en route to a new customer site.
</p><p>
The code in the article that starts with <tt  >curl --silent</tt>, I finished up on the last
section with the following change after the last \:

<pre     class="programlisting">
lynx -dump -stdin &gt; $HOME/Desktop/directions.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
Then I added a line that gets me set to print the listing sent by the script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gedit $HOME/Desktop/directions.txt
</pre>

<br><br>&mdash;<br>

Back to School for Linux</h4><p>
I've been wanting to go back to school for quite some time and complete my degree. As I've recently become
interested in Linux and open source, and I'd like to be able to leverage my education with my love of open
source&mdash;or at least open standards.
</p><p>
The only problem is that the more I look, the more I find degree programs centered around .Net and Microsoft
operating systems. Are there any schools that offer UNIX- or (even better)
Linux-centered curricula?
</p><p>
As I'm currently already established with family, friends and work, it would be incredible if I could get
a great education with the flexibility to attend remotely. Is such a thing in existence now?
Thanks for your help!

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
M. Miller  <br><br>
</p><p>
It's been quite a few years since I was in college myself, but my guess is that
Linux-specific degrees are pretty rare. My recommendation would be to look
toward programming, networking or Web development. They're not Linux-specific, but you'd be able to specialize within the field.&mdash;Ed.

Dave Taylor Is Doing a Good Job!</h4><p>
In the January issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, there was a letter from a reader that basically tore into Dave
Taylor. I just wanted to say that I think Dave Taylor is doing a good job. When
it comes to computers, there is always more than one way to do something. There is
the &ldquo;Good Way&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Better Way&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Wrong
Way&rdquo;.
</p><p>
There may be more efficient ways of doing things than the ways that Dave shows in
his articles, but that doesn't make them wrong. I think it would have been fine
for the reader to point out better ways of doing things. But, the letter came
across as just mean.
</p><p>
As someone who does many Bash tutorials myself, I know that you can have a 100
people like your tutorial, but it takes only one mean comment to ruin your day.
So, to counteract the bad day that read may have given Dave with his harsh
letter, I would like to give Dave some encouraging words.
</p><p>
Dave, you do a good job. I look forward to your articles each month. I thank you
for what you do, and I'm sure many readers would agree with me.

Netflix Streaming</h4><p>
In the December 2010 issue, a reader asks for help watching Netflix streaming
movies from Linux. I found a way to do that.
</p><p>
The problem is the Microsoft DRM, which is difficult to get around, but you can
proxy it. By proxy, I mean you can use a Windows-intermediary computer. With a
Windows PC running PlayOn software from MediaMall, you can make Netflix streaming
video available to a Linux box. I describe this setup for watching Netflix with
VLC on Linux in my blog (<a href="http://www.innate-ideas.net" target="_self">www.innate-ideas.net</a>), but this method also works for
watching with XBMC or other UPnP/DLNA-aware software under Linux.
Hope that helps.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Earl   <br><br>
</p><p>
Thanks. You are correct, PlayOn (although not free) works fairly well, but
unfortunately, it still requires Windows to work. Granted, you don't need to be
sitting at the Windows computer if you use PlayOn, but it's still there. It's
very frustrating that Netflix insists on using Microsoft's Silverlight DRM.
Thanks for the recommendation. For those folks who don't mind a Windows
install hiding in a closet somewhere, it's a great way to watch streaming video
on Linux.&mdash;Ed.

More Ways to Count Files</h4><p>
Reading the letter &ldquo;Another Way to Count Files&rdquo; in the January
2010 <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>,
I find that Michael Eager's method improves on Dave Taylor's by reducing the
number of external programs called (to a round zero) and also by actually removing
a bug (introducing another though).
</p><p>
Dave Taylor's script does not handle directories correctly as the
<tt  >ls</tt> command
would give the contents of matching directories instead of the names. This could
easily be remedied though, by using <tt  >ls -1d</tt> instead of
<tt  >ls -1</tt>.
</p><p>
But correcting that, Michael Eager introduces another problem instead. His script
cannot handle files and directories with spaces in the names. I know spaces in
names are frowned upon by die-hard Linux/*nix people, but despite being an old-hand myself, I use them regularly. I find that the Linux/*nix community probably
should be more aware of this problem, and maybe Dave Taylor could focus one of his
columns on this problem.
</p><p>
A solution that uses no external calls and without the pitfall of Michael Eager's
(my own requiring Bash though) is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#! /bin/bash
...
Matches=0
for Match in $Pat*
do
 if [ "$Match" != "$Pat*" ]; then
   Matches=$[Matches + 1]
 fi
done
</pre>
</p><p>
I am aware that my solution could be relatively costly if there are a lot of
matching files/directories.
I guess there is still more than one way to skin a cat.

January 2011 Issue</h4><p>
To Shawn Powers:
things you helped me with from this month's issue.
I'm now listening to Pithos&mdash;most excellent, thank you!
I have used BackupPC for about two years now&mdash;great to see it mentioned.
</p><p>
Tell Mick Bauer that his firewall series of articles is great. I thought about a Linksys
WRT54GL router&mdash;might do that. I just stopped using IPCop (I think that was last
month's article), and now I'm using SmoothWall 3.0 (just to get a 2.6
kernel).
</p><p>
I've been using the Clonezilla live CD for about four years now [see Jeramiah
Bowling's article &ldquo;Clonezilla: Build, Clone, Repeat&rdquo; in the
January 2011 issue]. It has saved my behind
more times than I can remember. It is an outstanding product and is developing
well.
</p><p>
Keep up the great work everybody! Oh, and, let's see, this is issue 201, so
let's see at least 201 more issues. That means, 13 issues per year, so
15 years from now, what will we be reading? Linux OS in world domination and
some upstart OS trying to knock Linux down a notch! (Maybe Bill's nephew, trying
to save what's left of MS. We can only hope.)

I'd like to keep my childhood fantasies alive and assume in 15 years we'll all
be living in space. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> will be where everyone goes for current events and information, and our flying cars will all be running embedded Linux. Oh, and my hairline will stop receding!
</p><p>
Seriously though, thanks for the kind words. We love what we do here, and it's
great to see others enjoy the fruits of our labor.&mdash;Shawn.

Linux for Science Column</h4><p>
Joey Bernard's new column, &ldquo;Linux for Science&rdquo;, is one the reasons I keep
subscribing to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>. Yes, I enjoy the system administration hints and
industry news, but what makes Linux so wonderful is the thought that I, or anyone
else, can use the same tools in basement science experiments that are used in
research labs. I am eagerly awaiting future articles from Mr Bernard.

<br><br>&mdash;<br>

<span   class="bold"><b>Joey Bernard replies:</b></span> Thank you very much for the encouragement. My day job

Welsh Command Prompt (PS1)</h4><p>
As a lover of Linux and the Welsh language, I thought it might be useful to
post a
Perl script that will give a Welsh language-based prompt.
Edit the .bashrc to the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
PS1='`/home/ed/cymraeg.pl`:`pwd`: '

cymraeg.pl:
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

%mis=(Jan=&gt;"Ionawr",Feb=&gt;"Chwefror",Mar=&gt;"Mawrth",
&#8618;Apr=&gt;"Ebrill",May=&gt;"Mai",Jun=&gt;"Mehefin",
&#8618;Jul=&gt;"Gorffennaf",Aug=&gt;"Awst",Sep=&gt;"Medi",
&#8618;Oct=&gt;"Hydref",Nov=&gt;"Tachwedd",Dec=&gt;"Rhagfyr");
%dydd =
%(Mon=&gt;"Llun",Tue=&gt;"Mawrth",Wed=&gt;"Mercher",Thu=&gt;"Iau",
&#8618;Fri=&gt;"Gwener",Sat=&gt;"Sadwrn",Sun=&gt;"Sul");

chop ($mnth = `date +"%b"` , $day = `date +"%a"` ,
 &#8618;$rhyf = `date +"%d"`);
 foreach $mmonth(keys %mis) {if ($mmonth eq $mnth)
 &#8618;{ $fy_mis = $mis{$mmonth}; }}
   foreach $dday(keys %dydd) {if ($dday eq $day)
 &#8618;{ $fy_dydd = $dydd{$dday}; }}
print "Dydd_$fy_dydd-$rhyf-Mis_$fy_mis";
</pre>
</p><p>
Assuming everything works okay, you should get the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Dydd_Mawrth-02-Mis_Tachwedd:/home/ed:
</pre>
</p><p>
For anybody who is a Welsh speaker and spends considerable time at a *nix
prompt,
this is, for me at least, a cathartic experience.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Ed Williams  <br><br>
</p><p>
I'm always worried when we print things I don't understand. The
little-geek-that-got-bullied-in-school part of me always assumes someone's making fun
of me. Although I don't think your command prompt is calling me four-eyes,
I'll leave it to our Welsh-speaking readers to figure that out.&mdash;Ed.

Correction for a Correction</h4><p>
First I would like to thank Dave Taylor and Frederic Mora (see Dave
Taylor's &ldquo;Function Return Codes and Daylight Calculations&rdquo; in
the October 2010 issue and Frederic Mora's letter in the December 2010
issue). The daytime
script became the beginning of a script I wrote to capture the power
generated on my home solar array. It's silly to log anything at night, so
figuring out when the sun will rise and set made the job easier.
</p><p>
But, the correction that Frederic wrote, although much easier to read is
also
incorrect. The early morning hours have a leading 0 (07, 08, 09 and so
on), so
bash takes those as an octal number, and starting at 8:00 AM fails with the
following error:


<pre     class="programlisting">
line 64: 08: value too great for base (error token is "08")
</pre>
</p><p>
So, you need to declare the numbers as base 10. This keeps 08 a decimal 8
and not the impossible octal 8:

<pre     class="programlisting">
currenttime=$(( 10#$hour *60 + 10#$min))
sunrisetime=$(( 10#$srh *60 + 10#$srm ))
sunsettime=$(( 10#$ssh *60 + 10#$ssm))
</pre>
</p><p>
An alternative is to strip off any leading 0.

Networking on the Command Line</h4><p>
It was nice to see a command-line tool for network configuration (see Joey
Bernard's Upfront piece in the December 2010 issue). Please do
more! I do have one thing to add. I am currently running CentOS 5.4, and
the
configuration files Joey mentioned in his article are different. Below
is a an example with the path. Also, note the difference in the auto
setting.
There is a configuration file for each network interface:


<pre     class="programlisting">
[root@CentOs01:/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts#] cat ifcfg-eth0
# Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] 79c970 [PCnet32 LANCE]
DEVICE=eth0
BOOTPROTO=static
BROADCAST=172.16.175.255
HWADDR=00:0C:29:77:D0:7E
IPADDR=172.16.162.3
NETMASK=255.255.240.0
NETWORK=172.16.160.0
ONBOOT=yes
</pre>
</p><p>
By the way, I'm really enjoying the 200th issue.
