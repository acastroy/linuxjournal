Many Massively Multiplayer On-line Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs)
exist on the Internet today. These games have their origins in the
original Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs) available on early UNIX systems and
bulletin boards, but they are scaled up to allow thousands of concurrent
players and have very high-quality graphics. Some of the more well-known games in this family are <span   class="emphasis"><em>World of Warcraft</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>EverQuest</em></span>. However,
there's another, fairly unique entry in this family of
games&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Second
Life</em></span>&mdash;that distinguishes itself from the rest for many reasons.
</p><p>
What is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span>? Put simply, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second
Life</em></span> is a three-dimensional
virtual world, developed by Linden Research, that lets its users explore,
interact, socialize and even conduct business. Unlike some of the other
games in the MMORPG family, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> is a
&ldquo;game about nothing&rdquo;. The game has
no real goals and no stated ways to &ldquo;win&rdquo;. Much like
reality, when your character (or avatar, as it's known in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second
Life</em></span>
parlance) is &ldquo;born&rdquo;, you can go anywhere and do anything.
</p><p>
Perhaps the most unique thing about <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> is not in its gameplay,
nor in its technology. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> contains a set of tools that allows its
players to generate their own objects in the game. These objects also
can be scripted, using the Linden Scripting Language (LSL) or Mono. Once
players create objects in the game, they own and retain the copyright
to those items. As such, user-generated content can be given away or
sold. 
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> also has its own currency (the Linden
Dollar, or $L). Players
can buy Linden Dollars via a currency exchange run by Linden Labs,
or they can earn money by generating their own content and selling it to
other players within the game. This has allowed for a virtual economy to
spring to life within the game, and some players have become prolific
enough at creating content that selling virtual goods has allowed them
to leave their real-world jobs behind. It's even possible to buy and
sell virtual land (sim space) within the game, and many players invest
heavily in land.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> has been closely related with open-source projects since
its inception. The game's client software (or viewer) contains many
open-source components and has been built by Linden Labs to run on
Windows XP, Mac OS X and Linux. In late 2007, Linden Labs announced
it would open-source the viewer under the GPL. Linden Labs has made
good on this promise, and as a result, several good alternative viewers
have sprung up. There also is excellent documentation on how to build
the viewer yourself, if you're inclined to fork the code and create
your own viewer. 
</p><p>
The server software Linden Labs uses is called the
simulator (or sim for short) and still remains proprietary, although
there are promises to open-source this component of the game as well. In
lieu of Linden Labs releasing its sim software to the world, there
has been a strong reverse-engineering effort in the community to create
a functional equivalent of the sim server software. The OpenSimulator
Project now has a functional alpha-quality server that's available under
the BSD license. The OpenSimulator (OpenSim) code is written in C# and
can run under .NET on Windows or Mono on Linux. This code is constantly
under development, and new features are being added almost daily.
</p><p>
Each area in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> is called a region or sim (short for
simulator). A sim is 65,536 square meters in size (16 virtual acres),
and there are thousands of sims in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span>
world. The
sims are devoted to all manner of things, from science-fiction sims where
you can fly your own X-Wing fighter, to medieval sims where you can be
a Knight of the Round Table, to Roman sims where you can stage your own
fall of the empire. If you can imagine it, it probably exists somewhere
within <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span>.
</p><p>
Although <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> has been dubbed a game, it has many uses besides
the obvious entertainment value. One of the most interesting purposes
for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> has been its adoption by many universities as a way
to augment distance learning. As of this writing, more than 100 
sims are devoted to educational purposes. Universities with
a presence in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> include Princeton University, Rice University,
Stanford University and the National University of Singapore. 
</p><p>
Religious
organizations also have found <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> to be a useful vehicle for
spreading their message. And, I've heard stories where <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second
Life</em></span> has been
a form of therapy for people with disabilities and other
challenges&mdash;although those people have challenges in real life,
in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span>, they
are free of any limiting factors. 
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> also provides a rich medium
for the arts&mdash;not only can you find live music and concerts (similar to
Webcasts) for any music genre imaginable, but there also are new forms of
art unique to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span>. There is machinima, or movies that are made
using nothing but <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> avatars, build tools and cameras. 
Creating sims also can be considered an art form, and some
breathtakingly beautiful and unique places have been created within
the game. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> avatars even can be considered
art forms themselves!
</p><p>
Many businesses also have taken up a presence in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second
Life</em></span>. IBM and Sun
Microsystems maintain a presence in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> metaverse, as do other
firms, such as telecommunications companies Vodaphone and Swisscom. IBM also
maintains many research sims, and it is a contributor to the OpenSimulator
Project. The Reuters news agency also maintains a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second
Life</em></span> presence and
has positioned itself as the news media for the virtual world, even
going so far as to have dedicated reporters working inside <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second
Life</em></span>.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> can act as a fairly full-featured
teleconferencing suite. The
client includes a voice chat component (which does work under Linux),
so having a meeting in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> metaverse is really quite
easy.
</p><p>
Several Linux User Groups (LUGs) are active and
meet on a semi-regular basis inside the game, so if you're living in a
rural location and it's difficult for you to attend your local LUG, 
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> may be a viable alternative for you to meet other Linux
users and discuss your favorite operating system. 
</p><p>
In addition to the
voice chat, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> also has group and private
instant-messaging
(IM) functionality, though this does not leave the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second
Life</em></span> world and
extend into the real world...yet. Linden Labs has mentioned possible
XMPP (Jabber) integration and a gateway into <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second
Life</em></span> for some time,
as well as the possibility of a &ldquo;light&rdquo; client being created to allow
for text-based chatting without all the graphical effects. 
Third-party viewers have this functionality already, such as the
Web-based AjaxLife.
</p><p>
Getting started in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> is simple. In a Web browser, go to the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> &ldquo;Create an Avatar&rdquo; Web site
(see Resources), and
fill out the necessary form. The form directs you to download the
client for your platform and provides instructions on how to install
it. 
</p><p>
If you use Linux as your operating system while running <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second
Life</em></span>, make sure you're using hardware that meets or exceeds the
recommended hardware list as published by Linden Labs. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second
Life</em></span> is <span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span>
graphics-intensive and will tax your hardware to its limit. Although you can
get around using a system with an integrated graphics chipset (I have used
an X60 with the Intel 945 chipset before), it's not a pleasant experience
to explore a virtual world at a two-frame-per-second refresh rate. I
recommend using an NVIDIA or ATI graphics card with a minimum of 64MB of
RAM that also has decent Linux drivers. If there is an optimal way to
configure your card (nvidia-glx or the NVIDIA binary drivers), I recommend
you do so. It can mean the difference between smoothly navigating the
virtual world or watching it flip by one frame at a time.
</p><p>
Once you get in the game, you land on an Orientation Island. This
island has mini-tutorials on basic <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> skills,
such as controlling
your avatar and communicating with other residents. Take the few minutes
necessary to learn the ways to move and interact within <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second
Life</em></span>&mdash; it's time well spent that will help alleviate
frustration later. Once you've mastered the basics, you can click on an object on the
island that teleports your avatar to the mainland where you can
begin exploring.
</p><p>
Once you've left the safety of Orientation Island, you're on your
own. From here, it really is a case of &ldquo;where do you want to go
today?&rdquo; <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> includes a robust search engine to help you identify
places to go and things to do that meet your interests. I took the
time to build a quick sample tour of some of the things within <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second
Life</em></span>. This is only a small slice of what can be done inside the virtual
world of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span>. There even are games within the game, each with
its own rules and miniature communities.
</p><p>
To get a taste for what is in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span>, let's take a
quick tour. The Resources section of this article includes links to these locations
(otherwise known as SLURLs), so you can visit them yourself. Let's begin
our virtual tour at the Sun Microsystems pavilion within <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second
Life</em></span>. 
</p><p>
Many
large corporations like Sun and IBM have established presences within
Second Life for sales and support personnel to reach out to the avatar
community. Frequently, these companies give away free virtual goods
here&mdash;at Sun's pavilion, you can get a free virtual 24" flat-screen monitor and a
free virtual Ultra 40 workstation. These freebies don't do much (they're
little more than static props), but if you're building a virtual workspace
or need a prop for some reason, these things can come in handy. Figure 1
shows 
my avatar standing before the Sun Mission Statement. Do you like my
fancy Linux T-shirt?

</p></div></div><p>
From here, let's teleport over to the Stanford University Library
simulation. This sim contains resources and exhibits for the various
Stanford University libraries, and the exhibits seem to change on a
semi-regular basis. There are also several news boards here that rotate
through Stanford-specific information pertaining to events within the sim,
as well as events on the real Stanford campus. Wander this virtual campus
enough, and you may bump into virtual students and virtual professors!

</p></div></div><p>
Our next stop is an example of the unique forms of art that can only
exist within the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> world. I had spent some time looking for
a good example of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span>-specific art, and I finally found it
on the Summer sim. Summer is a faerie-themed sim that's made to appear
magical and uses one-of-a-kind glow effect and particle displays to
achieve this look. From huge mushrooms to glowing
will-o'-the-wisps to
a miniature Stonehenge, this sim has little eye-catching details placed
perfectly throughout its 16 virtual acres. While wandering the sim, I was
lucky enough to meet its owner, Summer Seale, and she spent a moment to
show me one of her particle-based art forms, something she calls Chaos
Theory. Her avatar is perfect example of the avatar as an art
form&mdash;she looks like she'd stepped out of a fantasy movie. Figure 3
shows her in
front of her fireworks-like Chaos Theory.

</p></div></div><p>
Our final stop on this slice of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> is the Sci-Fi 
Works store on
Thunderbird Island. This place sells amazingly accurate reproductions
of science-fiction spaceships and other sci-fi props. If you want to
get an X-Wing fighter and hold a dogfight with a friend who's flying a
TIE fighter, this is the place. Or if you're a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star
Trek</em></span> fan and want
to pilot your own <span   class="emphasis"><em>Enterprise</em></span> or beam down to an alien world, that's an
option too.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10291f4.large.jpg"><img src="10291f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Captain of the Ship
</p></div></div><p>
I've touched on only a few of the things <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> can offer. Whether
your interests lie in creating and selling your own content inside the
game, in using the platform as a collaboration or educational tool, in
creating new and singular art forms, or in actually using the platform
for entertainment purposes, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> virtual world has a lot to
see and do.
</p><p>
In part II of this article, I'll detail how you can run an OpenSimulator instance on
your own hardware. Imagine...a private collaboration and teleconferencing
service for your business or simply a sandbox for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second
Life</em></span> development
to occur. Stay tuned!

Alternative Viewers</b></p><p>
Since Linden Labs released the viewer source code under the GPL, quite a
few forks of the code have emerged. There is a page on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second
Life</em></span> wiki that tracks these forks (see Resources), but here
are a few of the most popular ones:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Cool SL Viewer: Henri Beauchamp has taken many of the outstanding
bugfixes in the JIRA bug-tracking system for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second
Life</em></span> and applies
those fixes to the viewer before Linden Labs does. The result is an
incredibly full-featured viewer that actually may perform better than
the official viewer. Available for Linux, Windows and Mac.
</p></li><li><p>
Dale's SL Viewer: Dale Glass has added some features to the viewer,
such as a radar feature that tells you who's nearby, as well as support
for 3-D stereoscopic goggles. Available for Linux and Windows.
</p></li><li><p>
Onrez Viewer: a custom viewer created for a television show (<span   class="emphasis"><em>CSI: New
York</em></span>) and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> tie-in. Windows only.

AjaxLife: Katherine Berry is a talented programmer who's coded a text-only
