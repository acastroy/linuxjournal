Creating restricted shares on your secure Samba file server.

For the past four months in this column, we've been building a secured Samba server for
our local LAN, using Swat. To spare those of you who have been following
this series a fourth summary of the usage scenario, let's suffice it to
say, we're creating a series of file shares with varying user permissions.
</p><p>
This month, I wrap up the series by showing how to create a restricted,
&ldquo;owner-only&rdquo; share and how to use mount.cifs to make persistent Samba
mounts on your client systems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fa580.0x29f26c8"></a>
What We've Done So Far</h2></div></div><p>
Last month, we created a public share, SUPPER, and a nonpublic and
group-readable share called CHORES. Prior to that, we had set up
some global variables that are inherited by all shares. Those global
variables were:


<pre     class="programlisting">
workgroup             = FED-CENTRAL
security              = user
client schannel       = yes
server schannel       = yes
map to guest          = Bad User
guest account         = nobody
unix password sync    = yes
valid users           = mick, knute, pepe, skippy, nobody
read list             = knute, pepe, skippy
write list            = mick
</pre>
</p><p>
Attentive readers of Part II of this series [December 2008] may notice that I omitted
&ldquo;admin users&rdquo; here, even though in Part II, I had set that to mick. This
was an embarrassing mistake. On Ubuntu systems at least, this wreaks
havoc with how Samba interacts with Linux file permissions.
</p><p>
You'll recall that setting &ldquo;admin users&rdquo; causes listed users to be logged on to
Samba as root after successfully authenticating as themselves. In other
words, if &ldquo;admin users&rdquo; is set to mick, any time mick successfully logs
on to any share, he'll actually be logged on as root. The
<span   class="emphasis"><em>expected</em></span>
result is that mick, therefore, will have superuser privileges
and won't be restricted from doing anything at all. In practice, the
results tend to be much less predictable than that.
</p><p>
For example, on my Ubuntu 8.04 system, suppose I set &ldquo;admin
users&rdquo; to
mick, create a directory on the underlying Linux filesystem that's
owned by mick and has permissions of -rwx------ (or 0700), and then I
create a Samba share mapped to that directory that has no guest access
or read access (that is, a share like the one I'm about to show you how
to set up).
</p><p>
If I then try to connect to this share with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ smbclient //CASA_DE_MICK/BUZZ-OFF -U mick
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fa580.0x29f2bf0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and enter the correct password when prompted, sure enough, silently
and behind the scenes, I'll actually be logged on as root. But the result
of this login will be:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Domain=[CASA_DE_MICK] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 3.0.28a]
tree connect failed: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
</pre>
</p><p>
What? How can this be? Access shouldn't be denied to anything, for root,
should it? But denied it will be, if the share in question maps to a
directory not owned by root. This may or may not happen on non-Ubuntu
systems. My point is that using the &ldquo;admin users&rdquo; parameter may result
in unpredictable interactions between Samba and Linux filesystems.
</p><p>
As I said last month, letting people use Samba shares with root privileges
is dangerous anyhow. Samba client software isn't the correct tool for
Samba system administration, Swat is. So now we have two good reasons
always to leave &ldquo;admin users&rdquo; empty!
</p><p>
Now, let's move on to our share-specific settings. The smb.conf variables that
configured SUPPER, as set via the Swat tool, looked like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
path          = /home/mick/supper
read only     = yes
guest ok      = yes
invalid user  = root
valid users   = 
read list     = 
write list    = mick
admin users   = 
hosts allow   = 192.168.44
hosts deny    = ALL
create mask   = 0644
browseable    = yes
available     = yes
</pre>
</p><p>
These variables are set nearly the same for CHORES, except:

<pre     class="programlisting">
path          = /home/mick/chores
guest ok      = no
valid users   = +users
</pre>
</p><p>
What do all these variables mean? I explained them in gory detail in
the last three issues of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, and definitive descriptions can be found for all in the
smb.conf(5) man page. Some of these will come into play this month too,
as we create that restricted share.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fa580.0x29f3170"></a>
Creating a Restricted Share</h2></div></div><p>
You'll recall that our Samba server has four user accounts: pepe,
skippy, knute and mick, which correspond to my three roommates and
me. These are UNIX user accounts on my Samba server's underlying OS,
with corresponding but separate entries in the Samba server's separate
user database. (I explained how to create and synchronize Samba user
accounts in Part II of this series, in the December 2008 issue.)
</p><p>
For our restricted share, BUZZ-OFF, only mick should have read access
<span   class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> write access. No other user should have any rights at all on
this share. Accordingly, when we create the directory to which this share will
point, we'll be sure it's owned by mick and has a permissions mask
of 0700 (u+rwx,g-rwx,o-rwx), like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
drwx------ 2 mick users 4096 2008-11-04 00:00 buzz-off
</pre>
</p><p>
Figure 1 shows the first round of parameters we'll set upon creating this
share in Swat's Basic View.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10336f1.large.jpg"><img src="10336f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Restricted Share, Basic Settings
</p></div></div><p>
After setting the path, we set read only to no&mdash;I'll be creating
new files in this share&mdash;and guest ok to no as well, because we
don't want to allow any anonymous access. We'll set hosts allow and
hosts deny the same as our other shares&mdash;to permit access only from
the local LAN (your network address is, obviously, probably different).
</p><p>
We'll set browseable to no, so this share won't turn up in people's
Network Neighborhood or in smbtree listings. To connect to this share,
therefore, we'll need to specify its path when mapping it to a drive or
connecting to it with smbclient.
</p><p>
And, we'll leave available set at no until we've clicked the Commit
Changes button, clicked the Change View to Advanced button and
changed some things in the Advanced View (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10336f2.large.jpg"><img src="10336f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Restricted Share, Advanced Settings
</p></div></div><p>
As you can see, we're going to blank out the list of valid
users
except for mick and completely empty the contents of read list. The
write list, however, correctly contains the single value of mick.
</p><p>
The only other setting we need to change is create mask, which we'll
set to 0600. This is different from the 0700 mask we used when creating
the directory itself; the directory's execute bit needs to be set so
the directory can be used, but the <span   class="emphasis"><em>contents</em></span> of this directory,
which is what the share represents, do not.
</p><p>
Now we can change available to yes and click the Commit Changes
button. Our restricted share is ready for use!
</p><p>
To test this, let's first make sure the share doesn't turn up in the
local Samba browse list. We can perform this test using smbtree, like so:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ smbtree -N -b
FED-CENTRAL
   \\CASA_DE_MICK   iwazaru-ubuntu server (Samba, Ubuntu)
      \\CASA_DE_MICK\print$   Printer Drivers
      \\CASA_DE_MICK\SUPPER   Mick's menus
      \\CASA_DE_MICK\CHORES   Chore lists
      \\CASA_DE_MICK\IPC$     IPC Service (iwazaru-ubuntu server 
                              &#8618;(Samba, Ubuntu))
</pre>
</p><p>
Sure enough, the new share BUZZ-OFF doesn't appear in the browse
list. But, is it nonetheless usable by mick, its owner? Let's find out
with smbclient:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ smbclient //CASA_DE_MICK/BUZZ-OFF -U mick
Password: ********
Domain=[CASA_DE_MICK] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 3.0.28a]
smb: \&gt; 
</pre>
</p><p>
It worked. I've got a Samba prompt! There's no reason not to try a quick
directory listing before exiting:


<pre     class="programlisting">
smb: \&gt; dir
  .                         D        0  Tue Nov  4 23:17:34 2008
  ..                        D        0  Tue Nov  4 23:17:34 2008
  access-log_10312008.txt          665  Tue Nov  4 23:17:34 2008

        52008 blocks of size 262144. 13229 blocks available
smb: \&gt; exit
</pre>
</p><p>
Everything worked as expected. One last test&mdash;just to be sure, I want
to try
logging in to the share as a guest user. Remember that our Samba server
is set up to treat any login involving a nonexistent user name as a
guest login:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ smbclient //CASA_DE_MICK/BUZZ-OFF -U totallyfakeuser
Password: ********
Domain=[CASA_DE_MICK] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 3.0.28a]
tree connect failed: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
</pre>
</p><p>
It failed, in the expected and appropriate way. Our restricted share is
accessible, insofar as we want it to be.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fa580.0x2dec0d0"></a>
Using mount.cifs for Persistent Samba Mounts</h2></div></div><p>
Now that I've got a restricted share available to me, suppose it will
contain things I need to read and change on a regular basis. Do I need
to access it via an interactive smbclient shell every time?
</p><p>
Of course not. The ability to mount remote Samba shares as though they
were local volumes is one of the best things about Samba. You can do
this by using the standard mount command, along with Samba's mount.cifs
module, on your Samba client systems.
</p><p>
On Red Hat-derived and SUSE systems, the cifs filesystem and associated
utilities are included with the standard samba-client package. On Debian,
Ubuntu and other Debian derivatives, however, you'll need to install
the package smbfs.
</p><p>
Although based on the same protocols, smbfs and cifs are actually two
different things. cifs is newer than smbfs, and the smbmount command
formerly used for mounting Samba file shares via the smbfs filesystem
has been deprecated by the Samba team in favor of cifs and the mount.cifs
module. smbfs and smbmount are still distributed with Samba, but they
are not being actively maintained.
</p><p>
While we're installing Ubuntu packages, you'll also want the package
winbind, which mount.cifs needs in order to resolve NetBIOS or
Windows NT names (the Samba server we've been setting up uses NetBIOS
name resolution, not Windows NT). SUSE users will need the package
samba-winbind. I'm not positive, but I believe winbind is included in
Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora's samba-client package.
</p><p>
After installing winbind, you should add the string
<tt  >wins</tt> to the <tt  >hosts:</tt>
line in /etc/nfsswitch.conf (only root can do this; you'll need to use
su or sudo).
</p><p>
After mount.cifs and winbind are in place, you're ready to start mounting
Samba shares. To to this manually from a command line, you can invoke
the mount command as root or, as shown here, using sudo:


<pre     class="programlisting">
myclientlaptop-$ sudo mount -t cifs //CASA_DE_MICK/BUZZ-OFF 
 &#8618;./mymountpoint -o rw,suid,user=mick
</pre>
</p><p>
In this example, we're telling mount to use a filesystem type (-t)
of cifs. We're mounting, obviously, the share BUZZ-OFF on the server
//CASA_DE_MICK, using the mountpoint ./mymountpoint (which is an
existing directory within my current working directory). Note that I can,
if necessary, use my Samba server's IP address rather than its NetBIOS
(or Windows NT) name, in which case, that part of the command would look
something like <tt  >//192.168.44.123/BUZZ-OFF</tt>.
</p><p>
The <tt  >-o</tt> gives a list of options for this mount. The
first option, <tt  >rw</tt>,
lets me both read files from and write them to the share.
<tt  >suid</tt>
causes any set-uid bits on files in the share to be acknowledged.
<tt  >user</tt>
passes my Samba user name to the mount.cifs module so it can authenticate
the session. After entering the above command, I'll be prompted first
for the root password and then for mick's password.
</p><p>
Whatever you do, do not enter your password on the command line using
the <tt  >password=</tt> option. Because shell commands may be logged in various
places and are stored in shell histories, it's generally a terrible idea
to use any password as a command argument.
</p><p>
If your Samba credentials are unimportant, for example, because they do
not correspond to any user account with actual shell access, it's still
a good idea to avoid passing its password to a command. A better option
in that scenario is to use a credentials file, which is simply a text
file containing a user name and password.
</p><p>
However, that method is <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> appropriate for storing any credentials
you actually use to log in to systems. Even with strict file
permissions set, it may be possible for some unauthorized person or
process to copy or read the credentials file.
</p><p>
As with any type of filesystem mounting, you can save yourself typing
by creating an entry for your mount in /etc/fstab. For the example we
just used, a corresponding fstab entry would look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
//CASA_DE_MICK/BUZZ-OFF /home/mick/mymountpoint cifs 
 &#8618;rw,noauto,suid,user=mick 0 0
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, this line is very similar to the mount command line we
used earlier. One new option here is <tt  >noauto</tt>, which causes this line
to be ignored at system startup&mdash;this Samba share won't be mounted
until you issue a mount command, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
myclientlaptop-$ sudo mount /home/mick/mymountpoint
</pre>
</p><p>
sudo will prompt you for the root password. (Again, if you aren't running
Ubuntu, you could omit the sudo command and instead execute the rest
of the command from a root shell session.) Then, mount will prompt you
for mick's password.
</p><p>
Assuming authentication succeeds, you'll be able to use
BUZZ-OFF as if it were part of your local filesystem, located in
/home/mick/mymountpoint. When you're done working, you can unmount it
like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ sudo umount /home/mick/mymountpoint
</pre>
</p><p>
If you prefer your Samba mount to be activated every time your system
starts, you can omit the noauto option in your fstab entry. However,
unless you use a credentials file, you'll need to be present during each
startup in order to enter the Samba password when prompted; otherwise, your
startup will wait for you indefinitely. On a laptop system this probably
isn't a problem, but on other types of systems it very well could be an
issue.
</p><p>
Similarly, if your Samba server is unavailable for some reason when your
client system starts up, this also can cause the client startup to hang
or delay. When in doubt, stick to noauto mounting.
