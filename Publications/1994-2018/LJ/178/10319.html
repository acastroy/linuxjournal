Eagle Mode&mdash;File Manager with a Difference
(<a href="http://eaglemode.sourceforge.net" target="_self">eaglemode.sourceforge.net</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
For those sick of file manager after file manager that essentially do
the same thing, with only a slightly different interface, let's just say
that Eagle Mode (EM) takes a more ambitious approach. In the
words of EM's documentation:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Eagle Mode is an advanced solution for a
futuristic style of man-machine communication, in which the user can
visit almost everything simply by zooming in. It has a professional
file manager, file viewers and players for most of the common file
types, a chess game, a 3-D mines game, a multi-function clock and some
fractal fun, all integrated in a virtual cosmos. By featuring a separate
pop-up-zoomed control view, help texts in the things they are describing,
editable bookmarks, multiple input methods, fast anti-aliased graphics,
a virtually unlimited depth of panel tree, and by its portable C++ API,
Eagle Mode aims to be a cutting edge of zoomable user interfaces.
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10319f1.large.jpg"><img src="10319f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Eagle Mode's file manager lives within a virtual cosmos where other
programs and trinkets float around with it.
</p></div></div><p>
For those chasing a lightweight file manager, you're looking at the
wrong project. I almost choked when I read the system requirements: CPU
3.4GHz...per core! Plus, 1GB of RAM and a gig of hard drive space for
temporary files at runtime&mdash;this is an ambitious project that shoots at
the opposite end of the scale! Nevertheless, don't despair if you don't
have all the hardware requirements; I still found the project usable
on my apparently measly 512MB of RAM and 2.14GHz per core.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Thankfully, the software requirements aren't as Draconian as the
hardware requirements. The only major dependencies are Perl,
GCC, libx11-dev and the libxine-dev library for playing multimedia
files. There is a list of other smaller non-essential dependencies that
is long enough to make you scroll down the page (such as tar, xterm,
JPEG libraries and so on), but they're really the kind of things you
would expect for a file manager (and unless you have a system that's
more sparse than a nightclub in Salt Lake City, you probably have them
all installed anyway).
</p><p>
So, head to the Web site, grab the latest tarball, extract it and
open a terminal in the new folder's main directory. From here, I really
recommend reading the documentation included in the doc directory,
which, unlike a lot of documentation, actually is well set out and easy to
navigate. But, for the impatient, enter the following commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ perl make.pl build
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x251a580.0x26128d8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And, as root or sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# perl make.pl install
</pre>
</p><p>
I got an error in the middle of compiling EM, which said:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Building emAv failed, but that project is not so essential.
So if you don't know how to solve the problem, you could     
continue the overall building now, and live without the features
the project provides. Continue? [y(es)/n(o)/a(lways)]: y
</pre>
</p><p>
After doing some Googling, I still couldn't find out what emAv
was, but it seems to be non-essential, and the installation continued on
unfazed. EM seems to run fine without it. Once the compilation has
finished, change into the installation directory, which by default will
be: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd /usr/local/eaglemode/
</pre>
</p><p>
And, enter this command to run it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./eaglemode.sh
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Once inside EM's main screen, you'll be presented with a scene
that is deceptively conventional&mdash;a file manager in your home
directory. Double-click on a file, and it opens it. But,
double-click on a folder, and it opens a terminal within that
directory&mdash;that's weird. There's a bunch of extra info in the bottom right of the
folder too, what's that about? As soon as I roll the mouse wheel upward,
the whole scene suddenly zooms in, and I can see the contents of those
files in detail. That's kind of cool, but it still isn't what I'd call
groundbreaking. Then, I give the mouse wheel a few quick rolls backward,
and the whole idea of Eagle Mode unfolds in an instant. When you zoom
out, you find that everything is placed within a 3-D virtual cosmos&mdash;a
star field consisting of files, applications and fields of stars. Keep
zooming out, and eventually it is revealed that you are looking at
<span   class="emphasis"><em>a
cosmos that is living within the eye of an eagle</em></span>&mdash;just the
kind of artistic silliness of which I approve! Zooming out to the end of the
universe displays this proud eagle in its entirety.

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10319f2.large.jpg"><img src="10319f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Scroll backward all the way, and it is soon revealed that your virtual
cosmos is living within the eye of this proud eagle!
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10319f3.large.jpg"><img src="10319f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
I'm not sure if it
will come out in print, but those who look very carefully will be able to
see this as a white speck in its eye. Cosmic!
</p></div></div><p>
Zoom back in to the eye of the eagle and you return to the virtual cosmos
where you can zoom in to programs and folders in great detail. Clicking
on an area of the universe changes the &ldquo;aim&rdquo; of the zoom, and if you
hold the scroll wheel in and move the mouse in any direction, it will
scroll around the screen that way. Included in these applications and
objects are things like system folders, a clock, documentation and games,
and I'm sure there are some hidden objects in that star field somewhere. For
those looking for a distraction, a version of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chess</em></span> has been included
(with a rather aggressive AI, it must be said) and a game simply called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mines</em></span> that is a mind-bending 3-D take on the classic
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mine Sweeper</em></span>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10319f4.large.jpg"><img src="10319f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Waste time in Eagle Mode playing a rather lovely 3-D
<span  class="emphasis"><em>Chess</em></span> game against a
rather nasty AI.
</p></div></div><p>
Overall, if you're sick of navigating your PC with something that
feels like it was designed by a bank manager (or if you simply want to
put all those GHz your new PC came with to use), Eagle Mode just
might be for you (not recommended for boring people though).

Mp3Wrap&mdash;MP3 Merger
(<a href="http://mp3wrap.sourceforge.net" target="_self">mp3wrap.sourceforge.net</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
With podcasting becoming ever more popular, people are dealing with large
groups of MP3s that have to be squished into one big file and sent out
to the general public. This in itself isn't very hard, but these files
generally are all re-encoded and placed in something like a run-of-the-mill
128kbps MP3. When something that already has been under lossy file
compression, like an MP3, gets encoded a second time, it loses a great deal
of audio quality, and the resulting sound is more like a warbly old vinyl
record being pumped through a Commodore 64. Well, worry no more radio DJs;
this project may be just for you. According to the Mp3Wrap Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Mp3Wrap is a free, independent alternative to AlbumWrap. It's a
command-line utility that wraps quickly two or more MP3 files in one
single large playable MP3, without losing filenames and ID3 information
(and without need of decoding/encoding). It also provides the possibility of
including other non-MP3 files, such as playlists, info files, cover
images, inside the MP3. This means you obtain a large MP3 that you
can split at any moment just using mp3splt, and in a few seconds, you have
all the original files again! It's useful because files created with Mp3Wrap
are easy to download. In fact, you don't need to know each song name to
download, and it's easy to play. Even if you don't have mp3splt to split
the file, you can listen to it anyway.
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10319f5.large.jpg"><img src="10319f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
The mix-tape is back! Mp3Wrap lets you compile multiple MP3s into
one large file <span  class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span> losing any sound quality.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Installing Mp3Wrap is a doddle, with a choice of a source
tarball or .rpm and .deb packages. Plus, compiling the source is easy
and painless. Click the DOWNLOAD link at the bottom of the home
page for a list of all the package options. If you're going with the
source version, grab the tarball, save it locally and extract it. Open
a terminal in the new folder, and do your run-of-the-mill:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure
$ make
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x251a580.0x2613bc0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And, as root or sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Mp3Wrap currently is a command-line-driven affair, but don't let that
put you off, as it's quite simple. The syntax is as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mp3wrap finaloutcomefile filetoadd1 filetoadd2
</pre>
</p><p>
It looked like this after I had given it some files:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mp3wrap compilation1.mp3 
 &#8618;02-Origa_Ft_Shanti_Snyder-Rise-2004.mp3 11\ 
 &#8618;Inner\ Universe.mp3
</pre>
</p><p>
The terminal output
does give some useful information as to what's happening. As a side note,
remember that for some reason the program will insert _MP3WRAP
just before the .mp3 extension as a sort of identifying mark, so if
you're doing something like writing a shell script and having trouble
finding your compilation MP3 file, that will be why.
</p><p>
A bunch of useful switches are included, the best of which is
-a, allowing you to add more MP3 files to an existing
&ldquo;wrapped&rdquo;
MP3. Another useful switch is -l, which when passed a wrapped MP3 will
list whatever files are inside. Check the man page for more
details.
</p><p>
A drawback of the command-line nature of Mp3Wrap is that it may
become very tiring and strenuous when dealing with a long list of
MP3 files (which probably will lead to some mistakes with
long playlists). Also, although Mp3Wrap's files are usable on just about
anything that will play MP3s, they do have trouble seeking in some
older players, such as XMMS and the like. This project is just begging
for a GUI front end (which its cousin application mp3splt already has),
as a GUI on top would make things much easier for a radio DJ on Friday
night and would avoid the likely mistakes that will come from compiling a
playlist of songs via command-line switches. Teething problems aside
though, this program is a very clever one that will give 
podcasters a distinct edge over their rivals with original rip quality
in their songs, and it might find its way into the hearts of many MySpace
emo types looking to make an awful &ldquo;mix-tape&rdquo; MP3 compilation for some
budding emo on-line girlfriend. Radio DJs and sad teenagers rejoice!

</p><p>
Sick of selling on eBay and getting slugged by seller fees? Or, would
you simply like more control by having your own Web auction? Well,
Web Auction (imaginative title, I know) might be exactly what you
need. Designed for organizations or individuals, Web Auction is
simple and quick to use, and it differs from eBay in that only administrators
can add products, giving you full control over your auction. You
<span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> host an auction by yourself, but the Web Auction
folks 
currently are letting you host auctions on their servers for free, which is
jolly nice of them!
