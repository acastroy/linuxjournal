The Google Web Toolkit allows for modern Web development using Java,
without ever needing to write a single line of HTML or JavaScript.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b6580.0x16ae250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
There's much hype related to Web 2.0, and most people 
agree that software like Google Maps, Gmail and Flickr fall into that
category. Wouldn't you like to develop similar programs allowing users
to drag around maps or refresh
their e-mail inboxes, all without ever needing to reload the screen?
</p><p>
Until recently, creating such highly interactive programs was, to say the
least, difficult. Few development tools, little debugging help and
browser incompatibilities all added up to a complex mix. Now, however,
if you want to produce such cutting-edge applications, you
can use modern software methodologies and tools, work
with the high-level Java language, and forget about HTML, JavaScript
and whether Firefox and Internet Explorer behave the same way.
The Google Web Toolkit (GWT) makes it easy to do a better job and 
produce more modern Web 2.0 programs for your users.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b6580.0x16ae460"></a>
What Is Web 2.0?</h2></div></div><p>
This question has several answers, including Sir Tim Berners-Lee's
(the creator of the World Wide Web) view that it's just a reuse of components
that were there already. It originally was coined by Tim
O'Reilly, promoting &ldquo;the Web as a platform&rdquo;, with data as a driving
force and technologies fostering innovation by assembling systems and
sites that get information and features from distributed, different,
independent developers and services.
</p><p>
This notion goes along with the idea of letting users run applications
entirely through a browser, without installing anything on
their machines. These new programs usually feature rich,
user-friendly interfaces, akin to the ones you would get from an
installed program, and they generally are achieved with AJAX (see the What
Is AJAX? sidebar) to
reduce download times and speed up display time.
</p><p>
Web 2.0 applications use the same infrastructure that developers
are largely already familiar with: dynamic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
In addition, they often use XML or JSON for representing and communicating data
between the server and browser.
This data communication is often done using Web service requests
via the DOM API XMLHttpRequest.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b6580.0x16ae670"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
What Is AJAX?</b></p><p>
The standard model for Web applications is something like this: you get a
screenful of text and fields from a server, you fill in some fields, and
when you click a button, the browser sends the data you typed to
a server (wait), which processes it (wait), and sends back an answer
(wait), which your browser displays, and then the cycle restarts. This
is by far the most common way Web applications operate, and you must get
used to the delays. Nothing happens immediately, because every answer
that needs data from a server requires a round trip.
</p><p>
AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) is a technique that lets a Web
application communicate in the background (asynchronously) with a
Web server to exchange (send or receive) data with it. This does away
with the requirement to reload the whole page after every action or
user click. Thus, using AJAX increases the level of interaction,
does away with waiting for pages to reload and allows for enhanced
functionality. A well-programmed application will send requests in the
background, as you are doing other things, so you won't have to stare
at a blank screen or a turning-hourglass cursor.
This is the Asynchronous part of AJAX acronym.
</p><p>
The next part of the AJAX acronym is JavaScript.
JavaScript allows a Web page to contain a program, and this
program is what allows the Web page to connect to a
server as previously described.
However, it's not just a question of having JavaScript, but
also of how it is implemented in the browser. Both Firefox and
Internet Explorer both provide AJAX access, but with some differences, so
programmers must take those differences into account when doing the connection.
Data is usually retrieved using XMLHttpRequest,
but other techniques are possible, such as using iframes.
</p><p>
Finally, the last part of the AJAX acronym is XML.
XML is a standard markup language, used for sharing and passing information.
As we've seen, the name of the DOM API for making Web service
requests is named XMLHttpRequest, and most likely, the original
intent was that XML be used as the protocol for exchanging data
between browser and server.
However, neither the X in AJAX nor the XML in XMLHttpRequest means
that you have to use XML; any data protocol at all,
including no protocol, can be used.
</p><p>
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) often is used; it's more
lightweight than XML, and as you might guess by its name, is
often a better fit for JavaScript.
See Figure 3 for some actual JSON code;
remember, it's not meant to be clear to humans,
but compact and easy to understand for machines.
</p><p>
AJAX comprises basic technologies that have been around for a while now, and the AJAX term itself was created in
2005 by Jesse Garrett. GWT uses AJAX to allow the client
program to communicate with the server or execute procedures
on it in a fully transparent way. Of course, you also
can use AJAX explicitly for any special purposes you might have.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b6580.0x16aea38"></a>
What Is the Google Web Toolkit?</h2></div></div><p>
The Google Web Toolkit (GWT&mdash;rhymes with &ldquo;nitwit&rdquo;) is a tool for Web programmers. Its first public
appearance was in May 2006 at the JavaOne conference. Currently (at
the time of this writing), version 1.5.3 has just been released. It is 
licensed mainly under the Apache 2.0 Open Source License, but some of its
components are under different licenses.
Don't confuse JavaScript with Java;
despite the name, the languages are unrelated, and the
similarities come from some common roots.
</p><p>
In short, GWT makes it easier to write high-performing,
interactive, AJAX applications. Instead of using the JavaScript language
(which is powerful, but lacking in areas like modularity and testing
features, making the development of large-scale systems more difficult),
you code using the Java language, which GWT compiles into optimized,
tight JavaScript code. Moreover, plenty of software tools exist to
help you write Java code, which you now will be able to use for testing,
refactoring, documenting and reusing&mdash;all these things have become a reality 
for Web applications.
</p><p>
You also can forget about HTML and DHTML (Dynamic HTML, which
implies changing the actual source code of the page you are seeing on
the fly) and some additional subtle compatibility issues therein. You
code using Java widgets (such as text fields, check boxes
and more), and GWT takes care of converting them into basic
HTML fields and controls. Don't worry about localization matters either;
with GWT, it's easy to produce locale-specific versions of code.
</p><p>
There's another welcome bonus too. GWT takes care of the differences
between browsers, so you don't have to spend time writing the same
code in different ways to please the particular quirks of each
browser. Typically, if you just code away and don't pay attention to those small
details, your site will end up looking fine in, say, Mozilla Firefox,
but won't work at all in Internet Explorer or Safari. This is a well-known classic Web development problem, and it's wise to plan for 
compatibility tests before releasing any site. GWT lets you forget about
those problems and focus on the task instead.
</p><p>
According to its developers, GWT produces high-quality code that matches
(and probably surpasses) the quality (size and speed) of handwritten
JavaScript. The GWT Web page contains the motto &ldquo;Faster AJAX than you
can write by hand!&rdquo;
</p><p>
GWT also endeavors to minimize the resulting code size to
speed up transfers and shorten waiting time. By default, the end code
is mostly unreadable (being geared toward the browser, not a snooping
user), but if you have any problems, you can ask for more legible code
so you can understand the relationship between your Java
code and the produced JavaScript.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b6580.0x16aee58"></a>
Getting Started with GWT</h2></div></div><p>
Before installing GWT, you should have a few things already installed
on your machine:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Java Development Kit (JDK), so you can compile and test Java
applications; several more tools also are included.
</p></li><li><p>
Java Runtime Environment (JRE), including the Java Virtual Machine
(JVM) and all the class libraries required for production and development
environments.
</p></li><li><p>
A development environment&mdash;Google's own
developers use Eclipse, so you might want to follow suit.
Or, you can install GWT4NB and do some tweaking and fudging and work with NetBeans,
another popular development environment.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
GWT itself weighs in at about 27MB; after downloading it,
extract it anywhere you like with <tt  >tar jxf
../gwt-linux-1.5.3.tar.bz2</tt>.
No further installation steps are required. You can use GWT from
any directory.
</p><p>
For this article, I used Eclipse. For more serious work, you
probably also will require some other additions, such as the Data Tools Platform
(DTP), Eclipse Java Development Tools (JDT), Eclipse Modeling Framework
(EMF) and Graphical Editing Framework (GEF), but you easily can add those
(and more) with Eclipse's own software update tool (you can find
it on Eclipse's main menu, under Help&mdash;and no, I don't
know why it is located there).
</p><p>
Before starting a project, you should understand the four
components of GWT:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
When you are developing an application, GWT runs in hosted mode and
provides a Web browser (and an embedded Tomcat Web server),
which allows you to test your Java application
the same way your end users would see it. Note that you will be able
to use the interactive debugging facilities of your development suite, so
you can forget about placing alert() commands in JavaScript code.
</p></li><li><p>
To help you build an interface, there is a Web interface
library, which lets you create and use Web browser widgets, such as
labels, text boxes, radio buttons and so on. You will do your Java
programming using those widgets, and the compilation process will
transform them into HTML-equivalent ones.
</p></li><li><p>
Because what runs in the client's browser is JavaScript, there needs
to be a Java emulation library, which provides JavaScript-equivalent
implementations of the most common Java standard classes. 
Note that not all of Java is available, and there are restrictions
as to which classes you can use. It's possible that you will have to
roll your own code if you want to use an unavailable class. As of
version 1.5, GWT covers much of the JRE.
In addition, as of version 1.5, GWT supports using Java 5.
</p></li><li><p>
Finally, in order to deploy your application, there is a
Java-to-JavaScript compiler (translator), which you will use to produce
the final Web code. You will need to place the resulting code,
the JavaScript, HTML and CSS on your
Web server later, of course.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If you are like most programmers, you probably will be wondering about 
your converted application's performance. However, GWT 
generates ultra-compact code that can be compressed and
cached further, so end users will download a few dozen kilobytes of end code,
only once. Furthermore, with version 1.5, the quality of the generated
code is approaching (and even surpassing) the quality of handwritten
JavaScript, especially for larger projects. Finally, because you won't
need to waste time doing debugging for every existing Web browser, you will have more time for application development itself, which
lets you produce more features and better applications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b6580.0x16af6f0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Packages</b></p><p>
Using GWT requires learning about several packages. The most important
ones are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
com.google.gwt.http.client: provides the client-side classes
for making HTTP requests and processing the received responses. You will
use it if you need to do some AJAX on your own, beyond the calls done
by GWT itself.
</p></li><li><p>
com.google.gwt.i18n.client: provides internationalization
support. You will need it if you are developing a system that will be
available in several languages.
</p></li><li><p>
com.google.gwt.json.client and com.google.gwt.xml.client:
used for parsing and reading XML and JSON data.
</p></li><li><p>
com.google.gwt.junit.client: used for building automated JUnit
tests.
</p></li><li><p>
com.google.gwt.user.client.ui: provides panels, buttons, text
boxes and all the other user-interface elements and classes. You 
certainly will use these.
</p></li><li><p>
com.google.gwt.user.client.rpc and
com.google.gwt.user.server.rpc: these have to do with remote procedure
calls (RPCs). GWT allows you to call server code transparently, as if
the client were residing in the same machine as the server.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
You can find information on these and other packages on-line, at
<a href="http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/1.5/index.html" target="_self">google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/1.5/index.html</a>.

A GWT Example</h2></div></div><p>
Now, let's turn to a practical example. Creating a new project is done
with the command line rather than from inside Eclipse.
Create a directory for your project, and <tt  >cd</tt> to it.
Then create a project in it, with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/path/to/GWT/projectCreator -eclipse ProjectName
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, create a basic empty application, with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/path/to/GWT/applicationCreator -eclipse ProjectName \
         com.CompanyName.client.ApplicationName
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, open Eclipse, go to File&rarr;Import&rarr;General, choose Existing
Projects into Workspace, and select the directory in which you created
your project. Do not check the Copy Projects into Workspace box so that the
project will be left at the directory you created.
</p><p>
After doing this, you will be able to edit both the HTML and Java code,
add new classes and test your program in hosted mode, as described
earlier. When you are satisfied with the final product, you can compile
it (an appropriate script was generated when you created the original
project) and deploy it to your Web server.
</p><p>
Let's do an example mashup. We're going to have a text field,
the user will type something there, and we will query a server (okay,
with only one server, it's not much of a mashup, but the concept can be
extended easily) and show the returned
data. Of course, for a real-world application, we wouldn't display the
raw data, but rather do further processing on it. The example project
itself will be called exampleproject, and its entry
point will be <span   class="emphasis"><em>example</em></span>, see Listing 1 and Figure 1.

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10042f1.large.jpg"><img src="10042f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</pre></div><p>
According to the Getting Started instructions on the Google Web
Toolkit site, you should click the Run button to start running
your project in hosted mode, but I find it more practical to run it in
debugging mode. Go to Run&rarr;Debug, and launch your application. Two
windows will appear: the development shell and the wrapper HTML window,
a special version of the Mozilla browser. If you do any code changes, you
won't have to close them and relaunch the application. Simply click 
Refresh, and you will be running the newer version of your code.

Figure 2. Running the Created Application the First Time, in Hosted
Mode 
</p></div></div><p>
Now, let's get to our changes. Because we're using JSON and HTTP, we
need to add a pair of lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;inherits name='com.google.gwt.json.JSON'/&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b6580.0x16a7160"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;inherits name='com.google.gwt.http.HTTP'/&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b6580.0x16a72c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to the example.gwt.xml file. We'll rewrite the main code and add a couple packages 
to do calls to servers that provide JSON output (see The Same Origin Policy sidebar). For this, add two classes to the client: JSONRequest
and JSONRequestHandler; their code is shown in Listings 2 and 3.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b6580.0x16a7420"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
The Same Origin Policy</b></p><p>
The Same Origin Policy (SOP) is a security restriction, which basically
prevents a page loaded from a certain origin to access a page from a
different origin. By origin, we mean the trio: protocol + host + port.
In http://www.mysite.com:80/some/path/to/a/page, the protocol is http,
the host is www.myhost.com, and the port is 80. The SOP would
allow access to any document coming from http://www.mysite.com:80,
but disallow going to https://www.mysite.com:80/something (different
protocol), http://dev.mysite.com:80/something (different host) or 
http://www.mysite.com:81/something (different port).
</p><p>
Why is this a good idea? Without it, it would be possible for JavaScript
from a certain origin to access data from another origin and manipulate it
secretly. This would be the ultimate phishing. You could be looking at
a legitimate, valid, true page, but it might be monitored by a third
party. With SOP in place, you know for certain that whatever you are
viewing was sent by the true origin. There can't be any code from
other origins.
</p><p>
Of course, for GWT, this is a bit of a bother, because it means that a
client
application cannot simply connect to any other server or Web service to
get data from it. There are (at least) two ways around this: a special,
simpler way that allows getting JSON data only or a more complex
solution that implies coding a server-side proxy. Your client calls
the proxy, and the proxy calls the service. Both solutions
are explained in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Google Web Toolkit Applications</em></span>
book (see Resources). In
this article, we use the JSON method, and you can find the
source code at <a href="http://www.gwtsite.com/code/webservices" target="_self">www.gwtsite.com/code/webservices</a>.
</p><p>
The simple JSON method requires a special callback routine, and this
could be a showstopper. However, many sites implement this,
including Amazon, Digg, Flickr, GeoNames, Google, Yahoo! and YouTube,
and the method is catching on, so it's quite likely you will be able
to find an appropriate service.

Note that the last two methods are written in JavaScript instead of
Java;
the JavaScript code is written inside Java comments.
The special @id... syntax inside the JavaScript
is used for accessing Java methods and fields from JavaScript.
This syntax is translated to the correct JavaScript by GWT
when the application is compiled.
See the GWT documentation for more information.

The code in Listing 4 shows access to a single service,
but it would be easy to connect to several sources at once
and produce a mashup of news.

After testing the application, it's time to distribute it. Go to
the directory where you created the project, run the compile
script (in this case, example_script.sh), and
copy the resulting files to your server's Web pages directory.
In my case, with OpenSUSE, it's /srv/www/htdocs, but with
other distributions, it could be /var/www/html (Listing
5). Users could use your application by navigating to
http://127.0.0.1/com.kereki.example/example.html, but of course, you
probably will select another path.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
We have written a Web page without ever writing any HTML or JavaScript
code. Moreover, we did our coding in a high-level language, Java, using
a modern development environment, Eclipse, full of aids and debugging
tools. Finally, our program looks quite different from classic Web pages.
It does no full-screen refreshes, and the user experience will be
more akin to that of a desktop program.
</p><p>
GWT is a very powerful tool, allowing you
to apply current software engineering techniques to an area that is
lacking good, solid development tools. 
Being able to apply Java, a high-level modern language, to solve both
client and server problems, and being able to forget
about browser quirks and incompatibilities, should be enough to make
you want to give GWT a spin.
