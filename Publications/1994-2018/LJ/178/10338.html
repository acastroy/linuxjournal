<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #178, February 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
At the most recent kernel summit, <span   class="bold"><b>Greg
Kroah-Hartman</b></span> and a variety of
other kernel folks decided to create the <span   class="bold"><b>Staging
Subsystem</b></span>. It's not
really a subsystem in the normal sense of the word. It has no
particular technical focus. Instead, the Staging Subsystem is a place
in the kernel source tree where new coding projects can go, before
they are really ready to be included in the kernel proper. It's a way
to get code into public use quickly, by including it in an
isolated part of the tree. All kinds of crazy stuff can go in there.
Greg has listed himself in the MAINTAINERS file as the official
maintainer, but his task will be quite different from traditional code
maintenance. He plans to make sure submissions actually compile, but
beyond that, there will be a wide array of breakage, ugliness and
general chaos in the Staging Subsystem. This is all according to plan.
</p><p>
The overall motivation for inflicting this kind of mess on the kernel
is to accommodate <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span>' new efforts at accepting code more
quickly into the main tree. Because Linus intends to take code that has
been tested less thoroughly, and perhaps written less carefully, into
the kernel, Greg and others want to give that code every chance to be
tested and improved before Linus accepts it. All of this should result
in an ever-increasing speed of kernel development that ultimately probably was
made possible by the transition from BitKeeper to git many
moons ago.
</p><p>
Linus also has expressed a desire to change the way <span   class="bold"><b>kernel versions</b></span>
are numbered. Ever since he decided to throw over the old paradigm of
&ldquo;x.even is for stable series&rdquo;, and &ldquo;x.odd is for
development series&rdquo;,
the kernel has remained at version 2.6.x, with &ldquo;x&rdquo; just getting bigger
and bigger. With no clear threshold for incrementing either the 2 or
the 6, Linus, Greg and others are having a harder time dealing with
all the versions. Imagine looking at a dozen different version numbers
each day. They start to blur together. Linus asked folks to consider
alternative version-numbering schemes that would be easier to read
and just better in general. Unfortunately, he didn't give more clarity
than that, and when Greg opened up a discussion on the mailing list,
things degenerated into bickering.
</p><p>
The issue of the version-numbering scheme is closely related to
Linus' new plan of accepting code more quickly into the kernel and
to keep development as active as possible. When he abandoned the old
even/odd system, the old version numbering stayed in place, even
though it no longer meant anything. Now it seems clear that a new
versioning system will be put in place in the near-to-medium term. But,
judging from the discussions that already have taken place on the
issue, it may be a while before any meaningful suggestion comes up. A
number of developers, including <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span>, think any system will
have drawbacks, and so keeping the current one ultimately will be
best. But Linus wants a change, so it's very likely that he'll pick a
new number scheme before too long.
</p><p>
Efforts to eradicate the <span   class="bold"><b>Big Kernel Lock</b></span> (BKL) continue apace.
<span   class="bold"><b>Frederic Weisbecker</b></span> has come up with a tool to help folks target which
cases of the BKL should be eliminated first. Frederic's tool, the
<span   class="bold"><b>Big Kernel Lock Tracer</b></span>, tells how much time is used by each instance
of the BKL over the course of a system's uptime. Instances of the BKL
that use the most time presumably would be the best targets for
replacement by simpler locking structures. The BKL itself has proven
to be remarkably difficult to get rid of. Because it's so ham-handed
in its approach to resource locking, no other parts of the system can
do anything while a piece of code holds the BKL. Linus has wanted to
replace it with simpler locking structures for a long time, which would
allow the rest of the system to continue to function and lock up
access only to the specific resources in question. But the BKL is so
ubiquitous in the kernel, and the locking requirements for much of its
usage are so complex and individually nuanced for each situation where
it occurs, that a straightforward replacement is often just
impossible. In recent months, however, efforts to remove the BKL have
become more intense, and things like Frederic's tool only increase
that intensity.
</p><p>
Representing the <span   class="bold"><b>load average</b></span> of a running system as just a single
number has some drawbacks&mdash;what if you want to know the networking
load average as opposed to the disk usage load average? <span   class="bold"><b>Sena
Seneviratne</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>David Levy</b></span> have been working on a mechanism that would
separate out those different kinds of load averages and make
those calculations available to the user at runtime. It's possible
that the work they're doing may make it into the kernel at some point,
but as <span   class="bold"><b>Arjan van de Ven</b></span> points out, it's important not to break
user space. All the existing tools that rely on the current meaning of
the load average must continue to work. His suggestion to Sena and
David is that they feel free to add as many load average stats as they
please, so long as they keep the original total load average as well.

Anyone that uses Linux regularly is familiar with the &ldquo;Google to see
if it works under Linux&rdquo; procedure before buying any hardware. I was
thrilled when I saw the ad for a USB Atari 2600 joystick clone that
had a label on the box claiming its Linux compatibility. How cool!

<h2 class="title">Smarter Than Phones</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #178, February 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The phone business is changing at a rate so fast, and on such a curved
path, that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle</a>) comes to mind. Where it is
and where it's going may be conjugate variables, but trying to reconcile
the two is kind of futile.
</p><p>
In November 2008, the research firm Canalys released its Q3 2008 report on
&ldquo;smartphones&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.canalys.com/pr/2008/r2008112.htm" target="_self">www.canalys.com/pr/2008/r2008112.htm</a>). Worldwide sales were up 28%. Nokia still held the lead with
a 38.9% share of shipments, but that was down 3.5% from a year earlier, and
the number of phones shipped was down too. Apple meanwhile moved into
second place with a 17.3% share, with unit numbers up 523% over the year
before. And, that's with just two generations of a single phone&mdash;not a fleet
of phones such as Nokia's...and everybody else's.
</p><p>
Among operating systems, Symbian was first and Apple second. Following were
RIM, Microsoft and Linux, which had a 5.1% share and 49% growth. But that
was before Android.
</p><p>
T-Mobile's Android phone hit only last October 17, 2008, early in Q4. Here's a
telling quote from the report: &ldquo;Motorola, currently holding onto fourth
place in smartphones thanks largely to its Linux-based models, recently
announced it would move away from using the Symbian OS and focus more on
Android.&rdquo; Which is also Linux.
</p><p>
Both the iPhone and the Androids are platforms for running countless
applications, only one of which is voice telephony. I know lots of people
whose day-to-day digital lives are moving from their laptops to their
iPhones, BlackBerries and, yes, Androids. Although the
&ldquo;war&rdquo; between iPhones, BlackBerries and Androids will attract the most
attention, all three will win the battle of computing over telephony in the
mobile world.
</p><p>
Still, it's hard to do serious computing apps on networks built for routing
calls and charging out minutes. It'll take longer for that battle to be
won, but it'll happen too. The phone system will become a data system. It
will be borged by the Net.
</p><p>
What happens next is up to developers. For more about that, see this
month's EOF, &ldquo;Net Development&rdquo;, on page 80.

<h2 class="title">Linux Gets Faster with Splashtop</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #178, February 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
One of the nagging problems for Linux is that the most popular laptops are
still codesigned by Microsoft and its OEMs. It's not for nothing that
laptops come with stickers on the bottom that say, &ldquo;Windows
Vista&mdash;Business OEM Software&rdquo; or whatever. These are not white boxes. You can get
Linux running on them, but the hermit crab approach isn't the swiftest
route to market leadership.
</p><p>
It's starting to look like that route may come through Splashtop, by
DeviceVM. Splashtop starts a laptop in just a few seconds. Its Web site
explains:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Splashtop is preinstalled on the hard drive or in the onboard Flash memory
of new PCs and motherboards by their manufacturers. Splashtop is a
software-only solution that requires no additional hardware. A small
component of Splashtop is embedded in the BIOS of the PC&mdash;that's the part that runs as soon as you press the power button.
</p><p>
Within Splashtop, you have the choice of running one of its applications,
such as the Splashtop Web Browser, or booting your operating system.
Splashtop is compatible with any operating system, including Windows and
Linux.
</p><p>
Splashtop has similar networking capabilities to what you find in other
operating systems. It can connect to networks over Wi-Fi, LAN, xDSL and
cable. WEP, WPA and WPA2 wireless security standards are supported.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Note that first line. Splashtop does for Linux what those old OEM deals did
for Microsoft: gives it a leg up, an advantage right out of the startup
gate (pun intended).
</p><p>
At the time of this writing, Splashtop is preinstalled on laptops from ASUS,
VoodooPC and Lenovo, and on all motherboards from ASUS. Every one of them
is winning where it counts most with users&mdash;by saving time.
</p><p>
Splashtop is also committed to open source. At the time of this writing,
it's still
building its SDK. Check the Developers page at <a href="http://www.splashtop.com" target="_self">www.splashtop.com</a> for progress
on that. Meanwhile, expect to see more news about how Linux is winning the
battle for quick startup times.

<h2 class="title">They Said It</h2>
<div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The hungry and cold unemployed masses aren't going to continue giving away
their intellectual labor on the Internet in the speculative hope that they
might get some &ldquo;back-end&rdquo; revenue. &ldquo;Free&rdquo; doesn't fill anyone's
belly; it doesn't warm anyone up. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
...this recession will be great for free and open source because of the
shortage of cash. Last recession saw the mainstream legitimisation of open-source operating systems (youngsters, take note: there was a time when it
wasn't automatically okay for an IT department to use Linux), because it was
clear and away the most cost-effective choice. The saying I use is, &ldquo;come
for the price, stay for the quality&rdquo;. Perhaps this recession will
legitimise many of the applications (CRM, finance, etc.) higher up the
stack. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Since people contributing to open-source projects and on-line communities
have not (unless paid to do so) been paid to do so, thinking that
they'll stop just because they have potentially more time on their
hands doesn't make much sense. Contributors to free stuff usually do it
for reasons other than money.

CERN's decision to make the Web foundations and protocols available on a
royalty-free basis, and without additional impediments, was crucial to the
Web's existence. Without this commitment, the enormous individual and

and we wouldn't have the Web today.

<h2 class="title">What They're Using: Mark Pilgrim and the Latest Essentials</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #178, February 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Mark Pilgrim's original 2006 list of Linux Essentials
(<a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2008/10/28/essentials-2008" target="_self">diveintomark.org/archives/2008/10/28/essentials-2008</a>) was one of the
inspirations for &ldquo;What They're Using&rdquo;. For many, it comprised a handy shopping list of free stuff, graced
by proper snarks in the general direction of proprietary alternatives.
About Amarok, Mark wrote, &ldquo;It's just like iTunes except it automatically
fetches lyrics from Argentina, automatically looks up bands on Wikipedia,
automatically identifies songs with MusicBrainz, and its developers are
actively working on features that don't involve pushing DRM-infected crap
down my throat.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Well, just in time for this month's &ldquo;What They're Using&rdquo;, Mark came out with his
Essentials, 2008 edition. With his permission, here is his posted text,
verbatim:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Essentials, 2008 edition
</p><p>
Via email, &ldquo;Chris&rdquo; asks:
</p><p>
Enjoyed the 2006 Linux essentials list....Do you have any plans to update
the Essentials list for the latest and greatest that Linux 2008 has to
offer?
</p><p>
Well, I do now.
</p><p>
1. Debian GNU/Linux, because of Firefox bug 354622. In particular, comment 39
outlines Debian's position. (Yes, I know Debian still ships with nonfree
firmware, so Debian's position on Firefox is inconsistent. But no firmware
developer has ever tried to force Debian to &ldquo;bend the DFSG a
little&rdquo;).
</p><p>
2. GNU Emacs, still.
</p><p>
3. Iceweasel (see above) + Adblock Plus + NoScript + NoSquint + Greasemonkey.
</p><p>
4. Pidgin (formerly GAIM).
</p><p>
5. getmail instead of Thunderbird. It turns out I don't actually want a
desktop e-mail client. I use Google Apps For Your Domain to manage my own
address @ my own domain, and I archive it with a nightly cron job using
getmail.
</p><p>
6. gPhoto 2 instead of digiKam. It turns out I don't actually want a photo
library, just dated directories of image files imported directly from my
camera.
</p><p>
7. On the other hand, I do want a music library, and Amarok is still
best of breed.
</p><p>
8. KSnapshot, KTorrent, Konversation, k3b and k9copy are also best of breed.
</p><p>
9. There is still no good iMovie clone for Linux, but OpenMovieEditor looks
promising. I learned about it at FSOSS last week. I fear that Linux video
editing will always just &ldquo;look promising&rdquo;.
</p><p>
10. I've warmed up to GIMP, which has largely replaced Krita for my
(very light) graphic-editing needs. At FSOSS, I learned about ingimp, which
allows you to opt in to collect and aggregate detailed statistics on how
real people use GIMP.
</p><p>
11. GNOME Do, a Quicksilver-inspired launcher.
</p><p>
12. MPlayer, specifically the version provided by the awesome
debian-multimedia.org.
</p><p>
On the command-line side, I now use urxvt, screen, ZSH and these
configuration files. If you use the command line more than once a day and
haven't learned about screen yet, you're missing out. I still use SSH
heavily, in too many ways to count. If you use SSH and haven't learned
about SSH keys and SSH tunneling yet, you're really missing out. Also:
sshfs, rsync and SSH, SSH VPN, &amp;c. (Note: most of these work on Mac OS X
too, and Windows with Cygwin or PuTTY.)
</p><p>
I still use rsync for backups to my NAS, even though I have two Drobo
enclosures that I manage with drobo-utils. RAID is not a backup solution,
and ZFS on Linux isn't quite there yet.
</p><p>
Things I don't use anymore:
</p><p>
1. A desktop e-mail client. As mentioned above, I use Gmail (on my own domain,
so I keep my e-mail address).
</p><p>
2. OpenOffice.org, or any other desktop office suite. I use Google Docs, which
exports to Open Document format. I keep studious local backups in
ODF/ODS/etc.
</p><p>
3. VLC. There is very little that MPlayer can't handle.
</p><p>
4. Democracy Player. Ze frank doesn't post daily anymore, and I don't
particularly follow other video podcasts.
</p><p>
5. KMyMoney. It's good, but I fell behind in organizing my finances and it got
left on the wayside.
</p><p>
6. EasyUbuntu (now Medibuntu). Debian-multimedia.org satisfies all my illicit
patent-encumbered needs.
</p><p>
7. Beagle. GNOME Do is more than enough for my local search needs.
</p><p>
8. Konsole. RXVT-Unicode instead.
</p><p>
9. AllTray.
</p><p>
10. Brightside.
</p><p>
I also no longer use the ratpoison window manager. I've settled on XFCE
instead, with the PCMan file manager. I encourage every Linux user to try

brain and customize the hell out of it.
