    Alessandro tells us how to register a small device needing a
    single entry point with the misc driver.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b0580.0x16a82f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Sometimes people need to write &ldquo;small&rdquo;
device drivers, to support custom hacks&mdash;either hardware or
software ones. To this end, as well as to host some real drivers,
the Linux kernel exports an interface to allow modules to register
their own small drivers. The <span   class="bold"><b>misc</b></span>
driver was designed for this purpose. The code introduced here is
meant to run with version 2.0 of the Linux kernel.
</p><p>In UNIX, Linux and similar operating systems, every device is
identified by two numbers: a &ldquo;major&rdquo; number and a &ldquo;minor&rdquo;
number. These numbers can be seen by invoking <b  >ls -l
/dev</b>. Every device driver registers its major number with
the kernel and is completely responsible for managing its minor
numbers. Use of any device with that major number will fall on the
same device driver, regardless of the minor number. As a result,
every driver needs to register a major number, even if it only
deals with a single device, like a pointing tool.</p><p>Since the kernel keeps a static table of device drivers,
frivolous allocation of major numbers is rather wasteful of RAM.
The Linux kernel, therefore, offers a simplified interface for
simple drivers&mdash;those that will register a single entry point. Note
that, in general, allocating the whole name space of a major number
to every device is beneficial. This allows the handling of multiple
terminals, multiple serial ports and several disk partitions
without any overhead in the kernel proper: a single driver takes
care of all of them, and uses the minor number to
differentiate.</p><p>Major number 10 is officially assigned to the
<span   class="bold"><b>misc</b></span> driver. Modules can register
individual minor numbers with the misc driver and take care of a
small device, needing only a single entry point.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b0580.0x16a8608"></a>Registering a Minor Number</h2></div></div><p>The misc driver exports two functions for user modules to
register and unregister their own minor number:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#include &lt;linux/miscdevice.h&gt;
int misc_register(struct miscdevice * misc);
int misc_deregister(struct miscdevice * misc);
</pre><p>Each user module can use the register function to create its
own entry point for a minor number, and deregister to release
resources at unload time.
</p><p>The miscdevice.h file also declares <b  >struct
miscdevice</b> in the following way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
struct miscdevice {
        int minor;
        const char *name;
        struct file_operations *fops;
        struct miscdevice *next, *prev;
};
</pre><p>The five fields have the following meaning:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >minor</b> is the minor number being
registered. Every misc device must feature a different minor
number, because such a number is the only link between the file in
/dev and the driver.</p></li><li><p><b  >name</b> is the name for this
device, meant for human consumption: users will find the name in
the /proc/misc file.</p></li><li><p><b  >fops</b> is a pointer to the file
operations which must be used to act on the device. File operations
have been described in a previous &ldquo;Kernel Korner&rdquo; in April 1996.
(That article is available on the web at
http://www.linuxjournal.com/issue24/kk24.html.) Anyway, the topic
is refreshed later in this article.</p></li><li><p><b  >next</b> and <b  >prev</b>
are used to manage a circularly-linked list of registered
drivers.</p></li></ul></div>

The code calling <span   class="bold"><b>misc_register</b></span> is
expected to clear <b  >prev</b> and
<b  >next</b> before invoking the function and to fill
the first three fields with sensible values.
</p><p>The real question with the misc device driver is &ldquo;what is a
sensible value for the <b  >minor</b> field?&rdquo; Assignment
of minor numbers is performed in two ways: either you can use an
&ldquo;officially assigned&rdquo; number, or you can resort to dynamic
assignment. In the latter case, your driver asks for a free minor
number, and the kernel returns one.</p><p>The typical code sequence for assigning a dynamic minor
number is as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
static struct miscdevice my_dev;
int init_module(void)
{
    int retval;
    my_dev.minor = MISC_DYNAMIC_MINOR;
    my_dev.name = "my";
    my_dev.fops = &amp;my_fops;
    retval = misc_register(&amp;my_dev);
    if (retval) return retval;
    printk("my: got minor %i\n",my_dev.minor);
    return 0;
}
</pre><p>Needless to say, a real module will perform some other tasks
within <span   class="bold"><b>init_module</b></span>. After
successful registration, the new misc device will appear in
/proc/misc. This informative file reports which misc drivers are
available and their minor numbers. After loading
<span   class="emphasis"><em>my</em></span>, the file will include the following line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
63 my
</pre>


This shows that 63 is the minor number returned. If you want to
create an entry point in /dev for your misc module, you can use a
script like the one shown in <a href="2920l1.html" target="_self">Listing
1.</a> The script takes care of creating the device node and
giving it the desired permission and ownership.
</p><p>You might choose to find an unused minor number and hardwire
it in your driver. This would save invoking a script to load the
module, but the practice is strongly discouraged. To keep the code
compact, drivers/char/misc.c doesn't check for duplication of minor
numbers. If the number you chose is later assigned to an official
driver, you'll be in trouble when you try to access both your
module and the official one.</p><p>If the same minor number is registered twice, only the first
one will be accessible from user space. Although seemingly unfair,
this can't be considered a kernel bug, as no data structure is
corrupted. If you wish to register a safe minor number, you should
use dynamic allocation.</p><p>The file Documentation/devices.txt in the kernel source tree
lists all of the official device numbers, including all the minor
numbers for the misc driver.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b0580.0x16a9318"></a>Kernel Configuration</h2></div></div><p>If you have tried to write your own misc driver but
<span   class="emphasis"><em>insmod</em></span> returned <b  >unresolved symbol
misc_register</b>, you have a problem in your kernel
configuration.</p><p>Originally, the misc driver was designed as a wrapper for all
the &ldquo;busmouse&rdquo; drivers&mdash;the kernel drivers for every non-serial
pointer device. The driver was only compiled if the current
configuration included at least one such mouse driver. Just before
version 2.0, the generality of the implementation was widely
accepted, and the driver was renamed from &ldquo;mouse&rdquo; to &ldquo;misc&rdquo;. It
is still true, however, that the driver is not available unless you
chose to compile at least one of the misc devices as either a
module or a native driver.</p><p>If you don't have any such devices installed on your system,
you can still load your custom misc modules, provided you reply
affirmatively, while configuring your kernel, to the
question:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Support for user misc device modules (CONFIG_UMISC)
</pre><p>This option indicates that the misc driver is to be compiled
even if no misc device has been selected, thus allowing run-time
insertion of third-party modules. The file /proc/misc and support
for dynamic minor numbers were implemented when this option was
introduced, as there's little point in having custom modules unless
the allocation of a minor number is safe.
</p><p>Note that if your kernel is configured to load busmice only
as modules, everything will work with the exception of /proc/misc.
The /proc file is created only if miscdevice.c is directly linked
in the kernel. <b  >CONFIG_UMISC</b> takes care of this
situation as well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b0580.0x16a96e0"></a>How Operations are Dispatched</h2></div></div><p>Every time a process interacts with a device driver, the
implementation of the system call gives control to the correct
driver by means of the
<span   class="bold"><b>file_operations</b></span> structure. This
structure is carried around by <span   class="bold"><b>struct
file</b></span>: every open file descriptor is associated to one
such structure, and <b  >file.f_op</b> points to its own
file_operations structure.</p><p>This setup is similar to object-oriented languages: every
object (here, every file) declares how to act on itself, so that
high-level code is independent of the actual file being accessed.
The Linux kernel is full of object-oriented programming in its
implementations, and several &ldquo;operations&rdquo; structures exist in it,
one for each different &ldquo;object&rdquo; (inodes, memory regions,
etc.).</p><p>Back to the misc driver. How does
<b  >my_dev.fops</b> participate in the game? At open
time, the kernel allocates a new
<span   class="bold"><b>file</b></span> structure to describe the
object being opened, and initializes its operations structure
according to what the file is. Sockets, FIFOs, disk files and
devices get their own, different, operations. When a device is
opened, its operations are looked up according to the major device
number by referencing an array. The
<span   class="bold"><b>open</b></span> method within the driver is
then called. Any other system call that acts on a file will then
use <b  >file.f_op</b> without checking any other source
of information. As a result, a driver can replace the value of
<b  >file.f_op</b> to tailor the behaviour of a
<b  >struct file</b> to some inner feature, even if that
feature is at a finer grain than the major number, and thus is not
visible from the kernel proper.</p><p>The open method of the misc driver is able to dispatch
operations to the actual low-level driver by modifying
<b  >file.f_op</b>; the assigned value is the one in
<b  >my_dev.f_op</b>. After the operations have been
overridden, the method calls
<b  >file.f_op-&gt;open()</b>, so that the low-level
driver can perform its own initialization. Every other system call
invoked on the file will use the new value of
<b  >file.f_op</b>, and the low-level driver keeps
complete control over its device.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b0580.0x16a05f8"></a>An Example: Keyboard LEDs</h2></div></div><p>Since the discussion up to now has been much too
philosophical, it's time to move to a working example. The
<span   class="emphasis"><em>kiss</em></span> module (Keyboard Informative Status
Signals) is a simple tool to play with the keyboard LEDs. It
registers itself as a misc device using dynamic minor-number
assignment and is controlled by writing textual commands to it. It
accepts several one-byte commands, such as &ldquo;N&rdquo; and &ldquo;n&rdquo; (to turn
the Num-Lock LED on and off), the digits from 0 to 7 (to display
binary numbers in that range using the LEDs) and so on.</p><p>I don't think there's any need to include source code here,
as the driver does little more than the
<span   class="bold"><b>misc_register</b></span> code shown above.
Most of the additional code deals with interpretation of the
commands and actual lighting of the LEDs. The tar file with source
code and a <b  >README</b> file can be retrieved from
ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue51/2920.tgz.</p><p>As usual, the sample module that accompanies this article is
pretty simple and is of little interest in the real world. This
time, however, I think it can be of some interest. As a matter of
fact, custom hardware in my computer includes three LEDs to monitor
the number of running processes. In my opinion, this is useful
information when you are wondering why the computer is not
responding&mdash;a situation quite common whenever you write buggy
drivers or drivers that print too many diagnostic messages.</p></div></div>
<div class="authorblurb"><p>Alessandro is still using Linux 2.0, because he's
      spending his spare time building his own misc devices with a
      soldering iron. He enjoys open source and open air, and reads
