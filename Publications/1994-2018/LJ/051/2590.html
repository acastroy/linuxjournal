    Here's a good way to protect your files. Mr. Giles explains
    how to encrypt your entire file system rather than
    individual files.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1175580.0x126d2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>In one episode of &ldquo;Miami Vice&rdquo; Crockett
and Tubbs have managed to gain access to a drug runner's computer,
only to be stymied by its insistence on a password before
presenting incriminating evidence. Not to worry&mdash;after only three
unsuccessful guesses, the helpful computer offered to reveal the
secret password to our heroes. It's easy to laugh at this plot
development, but many otherwise intelligent people continue to do
equally dumb things.
</p><p>Consider the law office where legal papers are always kept in
locked cabinets behind locked doors. Every computer on the LAN also
has access to the &ldquo;password-protected&rdquo; word processing documents,
but the encryption can be broken in seconds with readily available
software. The name of this program, and the files it can crack, are
in the sci.crypt FAQ. These files could be retrieved by a hostile
agent &ldquo;working&rdquo; for a cleaning contractor.</p><p>Or consider the company with sales offices spread nationwide.
Highly sensitive pricing and contact information is distributed on
CD-ROM discs, which are discarded as soon as each new disc arrives.
Alternately, a salesman may have his laptop stolen while on the
road. (See <span   class="emphasis"><em>Practical UNIX and Internet
Security</em></span>, Garfinkel and Spafford, O'Reilly and
Associates, 1996.)</p><p>Or consider the individual computer owner who leaves his
system in a shop for free installation of an upgrade. One of the
employees quietly copies a few files, and by the time the victim
learns of the extent of the identity theft it's too late&mdash;he's
already recommended the same shop to several of his friends for the
unusually good service.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1175580.0x126d558"></a>Solution: File Encryption</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>For every complex problem there is an answer that
is clear, simple and wrong. --H. L. Mencken</p></blockquote></div><p>The simple solution to these problems is file encryption. But
this solution is flawed for several reasons:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Encryption <span   class="emphasis"><em>within</em></span> programs is
generally weak to the point of uselessness due to U.S. export
regulations.</p></li><li><p>Encryption <span   class="emphasis"><em>outside</em></span> programs
requires explicit actions to decrypt and to re-encrypt. This
problem may be manageable if a file needs to be accessed only by a
single user, but it's a much more difficult problem if several
people need to share access.</p></li><li><p>Explicit encryption requires sharing the password,
and the more people who have the password, the more likely it
becomes that someone will jot it down in an obvious
location.</p></li><li><p>Explicit encryption may enable a disgruntled
employee to encrypt the files with a different password.</p></li><li><p>Decrypting a file increases the risk that
unencrypted versions will remain on the disk or on backup
media.</p></li></ul></div>

Even with its flaws, file encryption may still be better than the
alternatives. Fortunately there is a better solution.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1175580.0x126db88"></a>Solution: File System Encryption</h2></div></div><p>Our solution is to encrypt the entire file system. User
programs see a regular file system&mdash;perhaps even a file system that
natively supports encryption. An attacker who can only see the
physical disk sees garble.</p><p>This approach is not perfect. Most notably, some
implementations could leave decrypted data visible in the disk
cache. That is a minor problem with the cache in core (if an
attacker has compromised root, you have more serious problems), but
a major problem if these pages get written to swap.</p><p>On the other hand, the kernel ensures that disk sectors are
decrypted during reads and re-encrypted during writes. The impact
on users is minimal. In one practical scenario, a &ldquo;responsible
individual&rdquo; will mount the encrypted file system in the morning.
(This requires the encryption key.) In the evening, the last person
to leave could unmount the file system, or it could be
automatically unmounted by a <span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span>
job.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1175580.0x126dd98"></a>Encryption Algorithms</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Better the devil we know... --Anonymous</p></blockquote></div><p>We've agreed on the desirability of encrypting file system.
But which encryption algorithm should we use? The wrong choice will
leave us with a false sense of security.
</p><p>Writing our own encryption routines is one possibility. The
downside is encryption algorithms are notoriously difficult to
properly design and implement. The problem is that the designer
does not know what others will find difficult. He only knows what
<span   class="emphasis"><em>he</em></span> finds difficult. Mathematics is littered
with the bodies of &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; problems which became trivial
after one person had a flash of insight.</p><p>As a practical matter, we should limit our search to
well-known encryption algorithms. This has the additional benefit
of allowing us to share encrypted file systems with others with a
minimum amount of hassle.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1175580.0x126e058"></a>XOR</h2></div></div><p>The first encryption algorithm learned by most programmers is
the lowly <span   class="bold"><b>xor</b></span> algorithm. To
encrypt the data, we XOR it with the key (modulo the length of the
key, if we use multi-byte encryption). To decrypt the data, we XOR
it with the key again.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Benefits: fast and exportable</p></li><li><p>Drawback: trivial to break</p></li><li><p>Synopsis: stops casual snooper</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1175580.0x126e420"></a>DES</h2></div></div><p>DES has a controversial past. It was a government-endorsed
algorithm for non-classified use, but some people believe that the
government deliberately introduced weaknesses. On the other hand,
decades of research have revealed only relatively modest
weaknesses. It is economically feasible for a large company to
build a DES-cracking machine.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Benefits: strong, well-tested, 56-bit keys (The
variant known as TRIPLE-DES uses 112-bit keys.)</p></li><li><p>Drawback: not exportable</p></li><li><p>Synopsis: a reasonable choice</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1175580.0x126e790"></a>IDEA</h2></div></div><p>DES was designed for hardware implementations&mdash;and is
difficult to implement efficiently in software. IDEA was designed
around the low-level operations common on small processors. It is
not a U.S. federal standard and wasn't weakened by the dreaded TLAs
(three letter acronyms, such as DEC and FBI). On the other hand,
while the TLAs have undoubtedly analyzed it, they aren't
talking.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Benefits: strong, tested, 64-bit keys (used
internally by PGP)</p></li><li><p>Drawback: not exportable</p></li><li><p>Synopsis: a reasonable choice</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1175580.0x126eb00"></a>RSA</h2></div></div><p>RSA encryption is a relatively ineffective algorithm. Many
people feel that the primary weakness with PGP lies in the 1024-bit
RSA encryption of the IDEA key, not the IDEA encryption of the
actual data.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Benefits: solution to public key encryption
problem, 128-bit keys</p></li><li><p>Drawbacks: requires at least 1024 bits for security
comparable to IDEA, very slow</p></li><li><p>Synopsis: not appropriate</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1175580.0x1265700"></a>Obtaining the Source: Cypherpunks</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.
--Alexander Pope</p></blockquote></div><p>Undoubtedly, some people now feel the urge to run out and
write an encrypting file system. The rest of us turn to the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Cypherpunks</em></span>. They have published a set of
patches to the 2.0.11 kernel which implement DES and IDEA
encryption in &ldquo;loopback&rdquo; devices. The primary source for these
patches is at:
ftp://ftp.csua.berkeley.edu/pub/cypherpunks/filesystems/linux.
</p><p>There are four patches:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>loopfix-2.0.11.patch: modifications to loopback
device</p></li><li><p>export-2.0.11.patch: more patches, mostly to
documentation and the makefile</p></li><li><p>crypto-2.0.11.patch: export-restricted patches: DES
and IDEA</p></li><li><p>mount-2.5k.patch: modification to
<span   class="bold"><b>mount</b></span> to pass encryption
keys.</p></li></ol></div><p>The U.S. government continues to interpret the International
Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) in a manner that prohibits the
export of meaningful cryptographic software via electronic means.
There are no restrictions on the export of the same material in
printed form or its subsequent distribution from sites outside
North America.
</p><p>The source code in crypto-2.0.11.patch implements DES and
IDEA encryption and cannot be legally exported, even though this
source is readily available worldwide. Violating export
restrictions will not aid the effort to promote the free use of
strong encryption, since the government could use this as proof of
the need for stronger restrictions on <span   class="emphasis"><em>domestic</em></span>
distribution.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1175580.0x1265de0"></a>Building the Kernel</h2></div></div><p>Building the new kernel is no different than applying any
other set of patches. The latest stable kernel release for which
this works is 2.0.30. For convenience, I will assume it is stored
in /usr/src/linux-2.0.30.tar.gz. Next, build a reference version of
the kernel. Then, follow these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Get the latest encrypted file system patches. For
convenience, I will assume that they are the 2.0.11 patches and
stored in /usr/src/cryptfs.</p></li><li><p>Apply the patches to the kernel, retaining the
reference copy. On my system, this involved making a working
directory, and applying the patches and fixing problems. I made the
working directory by issuing the following commands:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/src
rm linux
tar xzpf linux-2.0.30.tar.gz
mv linux linux-2.0.30.efs
ln -s linux-2.0.30.efs linux
</pre>


I applied the patches using these commands:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd linux
patch &lt; ./cryptfs/export-2.0.11.patch
patch &lt; ./cryptfs/loopfix-2.0.11.patch
patch &lt; ./cryptfs/crypto-2.0.11.patch
</pre>


I fixed problems using these commands:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mv *.h linux/include/linux
mv des.c linux/kernel
mv idea.c linux/drivers/block
mv loopfix.txt linux/Documentation
</pre>

</p></li><li><p>Configure and build the new kernel. Remember to
enable the loopback device and file system encryption.</p></li><li><p>Get the source for
<span   class="bold"><b>mount</b></span> and apply the required
patch. Build it.</p></li><li><p>Reboot the system with your new kernel.</p></li></ol></div><p>At this point everything should be ready to go, but I've
encountered problems after builds. I believe my problem was caused
by improper application of the patches, perhaps due to order-based
instabilities caused by changes between the 2.0.11 and 2.0.30 and
above kernels. One recurrent problem occurred with the
<b  >urandom</b> command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
od -x /dev/urandom | more
</pre>


Giving this command produced kernel warning messages. If this
happens to you, reinstall the kernel source and patches and check
your warnings carefully.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1175580.0x1266518"></a>Encrypted File Systems: Ready, Set, Go!</h2></div></div><p>Find a couple of blank floppies on which to test an encrypted
file system. Then, create an encrypted file system using DES
encryption:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/fd0 bs=1k count=1440
# losetup -e des /dev/loop0 /dev/fd0
Pass phrase: des test
# mke2fs /dev/loop0
# losetup -d /dev/loop0
</pre><p>A couple of notes about this example:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The first command initializes the floppy disk with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>random</em></span> data. Initializing the disk to zeroed
data reduces a blank disk to a &ldquo;known plaintext&rdquo; cryptology
problem&mdash;not a good idea.</p></li><li><p>The second command specifies that we want a
loopback device to cover the floppy device driver with a DES
encryption layer. We could replace /dev/fd0 with the name of a
file. The pass phrase is not echoed. Also, the pass phrase can be
120 characters long&mdash;and should definitely be more than 8
characters!</p></li><li><p>The third command is the normal
<span   class="bold"><b>mkfs(1)</b></span> utility.</p></li><li><p>The fourth command releases the loopback
device.</p></li></ul></div>

We also want to create an encrypted file system using IDEA; the
same idea, only replace <b  >des</b> with
<b  >idea</b>.
</p><p>Finally, create one more pair of disks which use different
passwords. (If you want to be unusually perverse, use your previous
IDEA test pass phrase on your second DES test disk and vice
versa.)</p><p>Now we're ready to mount these disks. First, try to mount the
floppies using a standard mount command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# mount /dev/fd0 /mnt -text2
</pre><p>These commands should fail with &ldquo;can't find an EXT2 file
system.&rdquo; Now try mounting each floppy again:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# mount /dev/fd0 /mnt -text2,loop,encryption=idea
# mount /dev/fd0 /mnt -text2,loop,encryption=des
</pre>


In each case you should be prompted for a pass phrase. Needless to
say, you should not be able to mount the DES encrypted disk when
specifying IDEA encryption, and vice versa. Likewise, you should
not be able to mount the DES encrypted disk 1 with the second
password or vice versa, and you should be able to mount the file
system when you specify the correct encryption format and password.
</p><p>This is another area where gremlins have appeared on my
system. Once IDEA encryption worked fine but /dev/urandom failed;
in another case, /dev/urandom worked but IDEA encryption produced
kernel warnings on every even sector.</p><p>Now a few more tests. Edit the /etc/fstab file to add these
entries:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/fd0 /mnt/des  ext2
        defaults,noauto,loop,encryption=des  0 0
/dev/fd0 /mnt/idea ext2
        defaults,noauto,loop,encryption=idea 0 0
</pre><p>Try to mount your test disks on /mnt/des and /mnt/idea. Once
again you should be prompted for a pass phrase and will be
successful only when encryption algorithm and pass phrases match.
</p><p>Finally, reboot your system and repeat these tests. If
possible, install the modified kernel on a second system and verify
that you can exchange media between the systems. Such is life on
the bleeding edge of technology.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1175580.0x1266eb8"></a>Applications</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have encrypted file systems, what can we
do?</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>We can add strong encryption to programs which
don't support them natively, and we keep their files on an
encrypted file system.</p></li><li><p>We can add strong encryption to distributed media.
Some people already build ISO-9660 images in a file via a loopback
device; producing an encrypted image would be trivial.</p></li><li><p>CD-ROM-based back-up protocols become more
attractive. Outdated back-up discs can be discarded without fear of
a dumpster diver gaining access to crucial information.</p></li><li><p>We can improve system security. Programs such as
<span   class="bold"><b>Tripwire</b></span>, which record
cryptographic signatures of key files, traditionally require
read-only media to prevent attackers from modifying the reference
information. It is still conceivable that an inside attacker could
replace this critical disk. Now, we can easily keep this crucial
information in an encrypted form, making a spoofed disk much harder
to produce.</p></li><li><p>We can add a measure of strong encryption to entire
systems which don't support them natively. Encrypted file systems
should be exportable via NFS or SMB&mdash;packet sniffers remain a
problem but the disk would be protected.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1175580.0x12673e0"></a>Long-Term Applications</h2></div></div><p>Even taking a cursory glance at the trends of security
software, one notices recurring themes. Encrypted file systems
protect the data on disks. SSH (Secure Shell) encrypts and
authenticates communications. Secure-RPC (remote procedure call)
encrypts interprocess communications. RPM authenticates software
upgrades.</p><p>Is there any question that encryption and authentication
routines belong in the kernel? Encryption keys could be stored with
each device and process, and with negotiations for unique session
keys automatically mediated between any process within and without
the system that desired it. There would not be needless duplication
of identical routines, or worries about export restrictions since
these issues would have already been addressed. If necessary the
encryption routines could be localized to a loadable module,
although that raises certain security issues.</p><p>The downside is anyone with root access can grab the
encryption keys from the system tables; however, once root is
compromised all bets are off anyway. On the other hand, supplying
strong encryption and authentication services in the kernel should
reduce the risk of root becoming compromised. Also, DH key
negotiation means that my keys aren't compromised even if I'm
talking to someone who is compromised.</p></div></div>
