    Mr. Popov shows us how easy it is to test SCSI devices when our
    operating system is Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bcd580.0x1cc52f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>A few months ago my ex-boss and I were
discussing the latest product of his company and the systems they
were using for testing purposes, both in the office and in the
factory. &ldquo;It's all DOS&mdash;what you want is cheap,&rdquo; he told me. I
believe that statement summarizes the reason DOS became the
operating system of choice for factories and many laboratories. A
fully equipped SCSI DOS system needs little memory, a cheap video
card and monitor and a relatively cheap SCSI controller. Of course,
these days there are many other reasons for using DOS for testing
SCSI peripheral devices. There is a vast knowledge base,
availability of ASPI-based tools and, most likely, the company
already has a hefty investment in test software or in developing
its own tests. (ASPI stands for Advanced SCSI Protocol Interface
and was developed by Adaptec. It is the de facto SCSI programming
interface on DOS and Windows.) Nevertheless, Linux is also a viable
SCSI test system, and there are some very good reasons why you
should consider Linux for testing your SCSI devices.
</p><p>Testing a SCSI sequential access device is not a simple
matter. These devices (DDS and AIT tape drives, to be specific) are
usually used in a server environment where system downtime is not
acceptable, especially when the down-time is due to the data backup
device hanging the SCSI bus. (DDS, digital data storage, is Sony's
4mm tape drive technology. AIT, advanced intelligent tape, is
Sony's new 8mm tape drive technology.) To put such a product on the
market, extensive testing needs to be done in quite a few areas.
Currently, the testing is performed on PCs running Sony internal
tests or Independent Software Vendor (ISV) backup software or OEM
proprietary systems running a flavor of UNIX, NT or some other
proprietary OS. The qualification cycle of these devices is much
longer than that of hard disks, but so is the life cycle of the
product. The more systems you can test on and the more types of
tests you can run, the more solid your product will be.</p><p>Some portions of the SCSI protocol cannot be tested without
using a specialized tool, such as an Itech SCSI emulator. This type
of tool allows the engineer to develop powerful low-level SCSI
tests to test the SCSI protocol handling. For example, with such a
tool you might issue a write command, send one or more bytes to the
drive, raise ATN (attention control signal) and then, when the
drive goes to output data, send an abort or reset message. These
tools, however, are quite expensive (in excess of $5000 US) and
certainly not all engineers need them, since not all firmware
engineers work on the SCSI protocol. By the time the product makes
its way to the test lab, most SCSI protocol problems are solved so
the lab needs only one of those specialized testers, mainly for use
in firmware regression testing.</p><p>Yet, with all of the specialized tests we have, some of our
most important testing is done on commercial UNIX systems,
surprisingly enough with well-written C shell scripts using
standard UNIX utilities such as
<span   class="bold"><b>dd</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>mt</b></span>. My guess would be that at
least half of the firmware problems in the past have been found
running these scripts on UNIX systems. Linux has all those
utilities, as well as a selection of shells. The same shell scripts
running on commercial UNIX systems can easily be ported to Linux,
maintaining the same functionality. This means you can supplement
the expensive commercial UNIX systems in your lab with a few
low-cost PCs running Linux. This alone makes Linux a serious
contender in the SCSI testing field.</p><p>Walk into a lab where SCSI devices are being tested, and
attached to the PCs on a single SCSI bus, you'll usually see a few
devices. It's certainly important to test more than one device at a
time; however, it rarely makes sense to have more than three or
four devices running under the same test. Even if you fully
populate the SCSI bus, if one device hangs overnight it sometimes
hangs the SCSI bus, not allowing the rest of the devices to
continue. It makes no difference, in this case, that you have six
other devices attached. What would be better is to attach a second
or even third SCSI controller and run different types of tests on
each one. That way you can utilize the system more efficiently and
thereby get more done in the same amount of time. Furthermore, if
one test finds a firmware bug and the bus hangs, the other tests
can continue. DOS, however, is not a multitasking operating system,
and if you wish to run different tests on each SCSI controller,
you'll have to add all that complexity to your test. Well, it's
really no wonder I've never seen that done. It's tough enough
debugging complex SCSI tests, not knowing whether the failure was
due to the test or the device. Adding additional complexity to the
test will most certainly take away from the firmware engineer's
time who will have to debug what may turn out to be a test problem,
not a drive firmware problem. Linux, on the other hand, does not
suffer from this limitation. You can write basic tests, add them to
your shell script and let the operating system worry about the
multitasking. If one test fails because of a hung device, the other
tests can continue running.</p><p>The standard UNIX utilities provide a high level of
functionality testing, but, to complete a test suite, the engineer
needs finer control of the SCSI device. The ability to send any
SCSI command, including commands with illegal bits set, as well as
illegal commands, is a must. This is one area where standard UNIX
utilities cannot do the job and an alternative method is needed.
Some time ago, I decided it would be nice to have a library of SCSI
commands that made it easy to write tests, as well as to expand the
library itself. So I started playing with the Linux generic SCSI
driver, which seemed the easiest way to go, and I recently released
such a library under the GPL. libdat.a contains just about all the
sequential-access SCSI commands and, if there is something else you
need, adding new commands is quite trivial. The library is packaged
with a tape tool called <span   class="bold"><b>stt</b></span>, SCSI
Tape Utility, which is based on libdat.a.
<span   class="bold"><b>stt</b></span> adds a powerful capability to
my Linux workstation at the office. I can now interactively send
any command to the tape drives, as well as reprogram drives and
make reprogramming firmware tapes. (These last two features are
removed from the GPL version.) It is also an example of how easy it
is to write SCSI tests using libdat.a and the generic driver in
general. Most importantly, I now find it easier to write tests for
my Linux workstation than for proprietary tools. Here's an example
of a short C program (the #includes are not shown):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
_Inquiry();      /* show device information */
_Space(EOD,0);   /* space to End Of Data */
_ReadPosition(); /* show current logical
                  * position */
_Space(FMK, -2); /* space reverse 2 filemarks */
</pre><p>While the above program doesn't do much, it does show the
ease with which the programmer can write tests. The stt utility
provides a longer example of a fully functional and useful program
based on libdat.a.
</p><p>You may be happy with your current test setup, but consider
the following questions. Could you do more if your OS was more
capable? What if you could write C programs and shell scripts,
instead of DOS batch files? What if your test system was fully
networked? Could you run the log files through a Perl filter to
format them and display them on your internal web site? Could you
benefit from the standard UNIX utilities, which you don't have to
rewrite? Certainly you could benefit from attaching more than one
controller to your system and running more than one type of test at
the same time while your OS took care of the multitasking. What if
there was a generic, easy-to-use SCSI interface and library that
gave you full control of your SCSI devices as well as access to all
source code? What if you could do your development on a platform
with a rich set of development tools, including compilers,
debuggers, version control systems, etc? Next time you are
considering a platform for your SCSI testing, look at the answers
to these questions and do yourself a favor. Consider how much more
you could do, if that platform was running Linux.</p><p><a href="2672s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
