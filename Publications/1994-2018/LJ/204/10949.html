I don't think a day goes by that I don't use Google to find something, and
lately, I've seen an increasing number of businesses that post Google maps
to their locations on their Web sites. Sometimes, these companies even
go so far as to put little push-pins on the map indicating each of their
locations, which makes things very convenient for navigationally
challenged people like myself.
</p><p>
I guess it would be possible to take a screenshot of a Google map and post
it on a company Web site. I also guess you could open that image up in the
GIMP and manually add a bunch of push-pins. Additionally, I guess you could use
an image map to make the push-pins clickable and interactive. Yes, you could
do things this way, and in a pinch, it might make sense, but
it sure wouldn't be as much fun as using the Google Maps API and doing it
right.
</p><p>
With the Google Maps API, you can create a map centered at a particular
location. You can place colored push pins anywhere on the map, and you can 
draw geometric shapes on the map. Perhaps you even want to draw borders around
delivery regions or school districts. The Google Maps API is incredibly
powerful, and I've scratched the only surface myself.
</p><p>
However, before you can get started, you need to get an API key by
registering with Google. This registration is free, and you receive your key
instantly. You do, however, have to agree to some usage restrictions. Most
of the restrictions seem reasonable. The only surprise is the Web site
that uses the Google Maps API must be publicly accessible; it can't be on
an intranet nor can it be password-protected. If you need to create an
application that will not be publicly accessible, you can make other
arrangements with Google. To sign up for a key, point a browser at
<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html" target="_self">code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html</a>. You will be
asked for your Web site's 
domain name, and you'll need a separate key for each domain.
</p><p>
Once you've got an API key, you're ready to start coding. First, you need to
create a simple Web page to display your map (Listing 1).

34
35 &lt;/body&gt;
36 &lt;/html&gt;
</pre></div><p>
Lines 1&ndash;14 are simple boilerplate HTML. Note that I include some in-line
styling for a div container called &ldquo;map&rdquo;. Here I'm mostly just
interested in setting the size of the resulting rectangle.
</p><p>
Lines 15&ndash;17 are where you load the Google Maps API. The section of the URI
that looks like &ldquo;v=3&rdquo; indicates that I'm using version 3 of the
API. This is also where you include the API key you obtained earlier.
Finally, you see the &ldquo;sensor=false&rdquo; section of the URI. This
indicates that I'm not using any type of location sensor, such as a GPS,
to select the appropriate map. Accurately configuring this field is
required by the Google Maps API EULA.
</p><p>
The JavaScript program that I wrote to load and manipulate the map is
loaded on line 19. On line 23, I arrange for an initialization function
that I wrote to be called when the page finishes loading and another
function, that Google provides, when I close the page. I discuss the
initialize() function shortly.
</p><p>
The rest of the HTML simply creates a container (mentioned earlier) to hold
the map and a few other containers to hold debugging information. You
might not want to display this information in a production
application, but it's instructional to see what type of information is
available from the API and what methods are available to the programmer for
keeping the display up to date as the user interacts with the map.
</p><p>
The rest of the map is created in JavaScript, so let's take a look at
Listing 2.

</pre></div><p>
In lines 1 and 2, I create a global variable to hold the &ldquo;map&rdquo;
object that the API will create. I also configure the latitude and
longitude to point the map.
</p><p>
The initialize() function is found in lines 4&ndash;27 and does all the work
of creating the map. In lines 5&ndash;10, I test to make sure that the user's
Web client is able to display the map, and if so, I create the map object.
Lines 12&ndash;18 configure the map. First, I select the location for the
map to display. Then, I add the map type and map navigation controls. The
map type control allows the user to select between a simple map, satellite
map or hybrid map. The map navigation control allows the user to pan
the map around and to zoom in and out. Finally, I configure the map to
display as the hybrid map by default.
</p><p>
The update_gui() function referred to on lines 14, 20 and 26 simply
updates the debugging information below the map and probably wouldn't be
used in a production application. Line 20 is interesting because it
demonstrates how to have your application react when the user scrolls or
zooms the map to other locations. In this case, the application simply
updates the lat/long coordinates below the map. I discuss the
update_gui() function a bit more later.
</p><p>
At this point, if you did nothing else, you'd have a map that users could
interact with. They'd be able to select the type of map, 
move it around and zoom in and out. But, let's
go a bit further.
</p><p>
The ajax_get() function called on lines 22 and 24 isn't included in Listing
2, but it's relatively easy to write. This function simply accepts a
URL and the name of a JavaScript function as parameters. Then, the function
makes an AJAX call and fetches the data at the given URL. This data is
assumed to be XML, which is passed to the indicated function.
</p><p>
The parse_markers() function referenced on line 22 accepts an XML string
that describes where to put markers on the map. This XML resembles Listing
3. As you can see, it's simply a list of assets; each asset has an ID, a
name, a description and a lat/long location.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ba580.0x12b3118"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

&lt;assets&gt;
&lt;asset id="1" name="Home" desc="The home base" lat="35" 
 &#8618;long="-105"&gt;&lt;/asset&gt;
&lt;asset id="2" name="BC Site" desc="The off-site site"
 &#8618;lat="34" long="-106"&gt;&lt;/asset&gt;
&lt;/assets&gt;
</pre></div><p>
The parse_zones() function on line 24 of Listing 2 works similarly and
describes shapes to be drawn on the map. The corresponding XML looks like that shown in
Listing 4.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ba580.0x12b33d8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

&lt;containers&gt;
&lt;container id="1" name="HQ" description="This is HeadQuarters"&gt;
&lt;point lat="35.0" long="-105.0" /&gt;
&lt;point lat="35.0" long="-106.0" /&gt;
&lt;point lat="36.0" long="-106.0" /&gt;
&lt;point lat="35.0" long="-105.0" /&gt;
&lt;/container&gt;
&lt;container id="2" name="OffSite" 
 &#8618;description="This is the Offsite Site"&gt;
&lt;point lat="37.0" long="-104.0" /&gt;
&lt;point lat="37.0" long="-105.0" /&gt;
&lt;point lat="38.0" long="-105.0" /&gt;
&lt;point lat="37.0" long="-104.0" /&gt;
&lt;/container&gt;
&lt;/containers&gt;
</pre></div><p>
Here, you see two containers and a list of lat/long points that define their
boundaries. So, with what you have so far, and some slightly different data,
you get a map that resembles Figure 1. By default, the map centers on a
location just outside of Albuquerque, New Mexico. You see a red triangle
that's filled in with green. The triangle is semi-transparent, so you can
see the map through it. You also see one of the markers in the lower-right
corner of the triangle. In Figure 1, I've clicked on the marker to
demonstrate the information window, which I discuss a bit more later.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10949f1.large.jpg"><img src="10949f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Final Results
</p></div></div><p>
Let's take a closer look at the parse_markers() function defined on lines
29&ndash;51 of Listing 2. This function is fairly straightforward and simply loops over a list
of assets. For each asset, the function parses the lat/long coordinates of
the marker and creates a marker object with them (lines 34&ndash;37). Notice on
line 37 that I had to use the lat and long variables to create an object
to pass to the marker constructor. Next, I set some additional attributes
for each marker for later use. Then, on line 46, I added the marker to the
map. Lines 48 and 49 are interesting&mdash;they allow users to click
on (or mouse over) a marker and display additional information. I've
commented one of the lines out because it doesn't seem to work well to have
a mouse-over and mouse-click event at the same time. I probably need some
additional logic, but you get the idea.
</p><p>
The parse_zones() function is only slightly more complex, because it has to
build a GPolygon object from the points listed for each container. Lines
53&ndash;62 are similar to the first part of the parse_marker()
function. The main difference is in lines 64&ndash;72 where I loop over each
point that delineates the zone, create a GLatLng object for each point and
push the object onto the bounds array. Then, on line 74, I create a
GPolygon object with this array of points. The GPolygon constructor also
allows you to specify a border color and size, as well as a fill color and
opacity setting. I add the polygon to the map on line 80. I add an
on-click event handler on line 81, so that when users click on a given
zone, the application can perhaps provide more information about the zone.
</p><p>
The event handlers defined on lines 86&ndash;96 are almost identical and
quite trivial, so let me make some passing comments about them all at
once. They each call the map object's openInfoWindow method to open the
little message bubble and display a message. In these cases, I simply
display the name or description of the object the user clicks on. In a
real-world application, you might use the id attribute to make an AJAX callback
to a server-side database and do some really cool things.
</p><p>
Finally, the update_gui() function on lines 98&ndash;105 is responsible
for updating some of the display information at the bottom of the map. To
do this, the function uses some of the map object's methods to get the
coordinates of the southwest and northeast corners of the map. Then, those
coordinates are converted to strings and placed inside the appropriate
container on the Web page. The map's zoom factor is handled very similarly.
</p><p>
As you can see, using the Google Maps API is pretty easy. The API is fairly
intuitive and exhaustively documented at Google. As I
mentioned in the beginning of this article, it's pretty easy to plot 
businesses' office locations or the locations of their customers. But, this
is the Web, and it should be fun. How about a geography quiz game with real
maps? Or a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Risk</em></span>-like game, or any number of military simulations set on a
virtual Earth? I recall playing a racing game that allowed you to drive a car
around a Google Map. The Google Maps API is simple and powerful, and 
lots of interesting things are waiting to be done with it.
