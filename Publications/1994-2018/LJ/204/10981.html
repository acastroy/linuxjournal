<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #204, April 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>stable kernel efforts</b></span> once again have gotten out of control. In
the old days, <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> had a cute
x.even and x.odd version-numbering scheme, where even releases were part of a stable series
that would last six months or a year or thereabouts, and odd releases
were part of a development series that would last roughly the same
amount of time. During the stable series, only bug fixes would be
accepted; during the development series, new features also could 
be added. Over time, that made various folks wish they were dead,
because the long duration of the stable series meant that tons of
people had to sit around and wait for the development series to open
up again.
</p><p>
With the 2.6 kernel, Linus abandoned the concept of a stable series,
and this too led to some serious uncertainty among people who no
longer had any kernel release they really could rely on. After some
vicissitudes, <span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span> and others started forking off
various 2.6 releases that they would maintain as their own &ldquo;stable
series&rdquo;, simultaneously with Linus' ongoing 2.6 release schedule. The
world stopped its desperate careening, and everyone took an easy
breath.
</p><p>
Greg and his cohorts chose which 2.6 kernels to fork into a new stable
series, largely based on what would work best for them. From the
outside, it seemed to be a fairly arbitrary and unpredictable process,
which gradually led to pain and suffering among a very specific subset
of users&mdash;the distribution maintainers. Anyone maintaining a Linux
distribution, or developing a Linux-based phone or other embedded
device, really wanted to know which kernels were going to have their
own stable series, so they could base all their hard work on that
kernel. But because there was no way to predict it, those folks were
running into problems organizing their work, making market
predictions and so forth. They began begging and pleading with Greg to
start a new stable series for the particular kernel versions on which they each
depended&mdash;or at least to make it more predictable which kernels
would get a stable series.
</p><p>
Greg and the other stable series folks couldn't accommodate this
without putting in a metric ton of additional work, so recently,
Greg essentially decided to ditch the whole project.
</p><p>
From now on, he announced, he will no longer maintain long-term stable
kernel trees. Instead, what he'll do is put out a few stable releases
for each kernel, just until Linus releases the next development kernel
version, at which point Greg will start putting out stable releases
for that version and so on. This way, Greg says, people will be less
likely to fixate on kernels that are super old and out of date and
concentrate on the more-recent, better, faster, stronger and more-beautiful kernel of the moment.
</p><p>
The existing stable trees, particularly 2.6.27, 2.6.34 and 2.6.35,
will not be going away. Instead, he's handed them off to other folks,
who will maintain them as they see fit. Presumably other maintainers
may be found to continue the stable patch series of future kernels as
well.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Willy Tarreau</b></span> will be taking over the
<span   class="bold"><b>2.6.27 kernel</b></span>, and he says he plans
to make it the new &ldquo;ultra-stable&rdquo; replacement for 2.4 kernels. His
intention is to give the remaining 2.4 users an incentive finally
to upgrade to 2.6 kernels.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Paul Gortmaker</b></span> will be taking over the
<span   class="bold"><b>2.6.34 tree</b></span>, essentially for
his employer <span   class="bold"><b>Wind River</b></span>, who has products that rely on that kernel.
</p><p>
And, <span   class="bold"><b>Andi Kleen</b></span> will be taking over the
<span   class="bold"><b>2.6.35 tree</b></span>, also essentially
for his employer <span   class="bold"><b>Intel</b></span>, who plans to release its own distribution
based on that series.
</p><p>
So, that's how things stand. It's not clear how future stable series
will come into existence, or who will be responsible for them, or how
they'll be maintained. But, if the current situation is any indication,
distribution maintainers may start assigning their engineers to become
stable tree maintainers. Maybe that's the direction things have been
going for a long time.

For Linux users, file decompression tools are as close as an
<tt  >apt-get</tt> or <tt  >yum</tt>
away. For Windows users who want to extract more than ZIP files, it means
installing a third-party application. That can mean paying for a program
like WinRAR, or it can mean installing a program like 7-Zip.
</p><p>
7-Zip will decompress (and compress!) just about any compressed file you
run across on the Internet. Sure, it supports its native .7z file format,
but it doesn't force you to use that rather uncommon (but awesome) file
format. It integrates nicely into the right-click context menu, and it's
basically the only compression program a Windows user will ever need.

<h2 class="title">Maximum Calculus with Maxima</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #204, April 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
We looked at Maxima
in the February 2011 issue to do algebra and rearrange some equations. But
those aren't
the only tricks up Maxima's sleeve. This month, I describe how Maxima can
help with differential equations, but I'm going to leave
out some of the intermediate results to save some space.
</p><p>
A lot of science involves figuring out how systems change over time and
what causes those changes. When you start looking at changes, and
especially rates of change, that is essentially calculus. Calculus and
rates of change also are linked to slopes of lines on graphs. When you
plot data and find an equation that describes it, you can find the
slope of the line by taking the derivative of the equation. Let's look at
a falling object and see what theory has to say about it.
</p><p>
You should start by looking at how you get a derivative. Let's say you have
the equation:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i1) f(x):= 2 + x^2;
                                          2
(%o1)                        f(x) := 2 + x
</pre>
</p><p>
You would find the first derivative by calling the function diff, giving it
the equation to differentiate along with the variable to differentiate by.
So, you would write:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i2) answer:diff(f(x),x);
(%o2)                          2x
</pre>
</p><p>
Maxima can do differentiation of expressions too. If you have a couple 
equations, you can derive their ratio with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i3) g(x):= x^(1/2);
(%i4) ratio_diff:diff(g(x)/f(x),x);
                                        3/2
                     1               2 x
(%o4)        ----------------- - -----------
                         2          2    2
             2 sqrt(x) (x + 1)    (x + 1)
</pre>
</p><p>
This might be a bit messy to work with, so you might want to refactor it to
a more concise form:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i5) factor(ratio_diff);
                                2
                             3 x - 1
(%o5)               - ------------------
                                  2    2
                      2 sqrt(x) (x + 1)
</pre>
</p><p>
Maxima also can handle trigonometric functions, but there are lots of
identities you can use to help simplify equations with trig functions
in them. By default, Maxima does not try to apply these unless you
specifically say so, using special functions. As an example, let's say you
have the following equation:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i6) diff(sin(x)/(1 + cos(x)),x);
                                2
                             sin (x)       cos(x)
(%o6)                   ------------- + ----------
                                    2   cos(x) + 1
                        (cos(x) + 1)
(%i7) factor(%);
                            2         2
                         sin (x) + cos (x) + cos(x)
(%o7)                    --------------------------
                                          2
                              (cos(x) + 1)
</pre>
</p><p>
That's still not very simple. If you then apply the function trigsimp, you
can force Maxima to apply trigonometric simplification rules to the
equation and see what you get:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i8) trigsimp(%);
                             1
(%o8)                   ----------
                        cos(x) + 1
</pre>
</p><p>
You should be aware of some important caveats regarding how Maxima treats trig
functions. The first is that <tt  >sin(x)^(-1)</tt> is the reciprocal of sine, not
arcsine. To get the arcsine, you would use <tt  >asin(x)</tt>. The other is another
trig simplification function, trigreduce. This function is used to reduce
the powers of trig functions by using the multiple angle formulas. For
example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i9) trigsimp(cos(x)^2 + 2*sin(x)^2);
                          2
(%o9)                  sin (x) + 1
(%i10) trigreduce(cos(x)^2 + 2*sin(x)^2);
                   cos(2 x) + 1      1   cos(2 x)
(%o10)             ------------ + 2 (- - --------)
                         2           2       2
</pre>
</p><p>
That may not look simpler than what you would get from trigsimp, but it is
an easier form of the equation to use with other functions, like
integration.
</p><p>
Maxima can apply the chain rule when doing a derivative. Say you have the
equation:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i11) f(x):= x^3);
                                3
(%o11)                 f(x) := x
(%i12) depends(x,u)$
(%i13) diff(f(x),u);
                         2 dx
(%o13)                3 x  --
                           du
</pre>
</p><p>
The line at <tt  >%i12</tt> uses a new function,
<tt  >depends</tt>. This is a way of telling
Maxima that x is a function of u, without explicitly defining a function
describing this relationship. If you decide later that you want to define an
actual equation for this relation, you can use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i14) remove([x,u],dependency);
(%o14)                     done
(%i15) x:sin(u);
(%o15)                   sin(u)
(%i16) diff(f(x),u);
                               2
(%o16)             3 cos(u) sin (u)
</pre>
</p><p>
Along the same lines, Maxima can handle implicit differentiation. Say you
have the equation x^2 + y^2 = 25, and you want to find dy/dx. You need
to use the depends function I just mentioned to handle this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i17) eqn := x^2 + y^2 = 25;
                    2   2
(%o17)             y + x = 25
(%i18) depends(y,x);
(%o18)              [y(x)]
(%i19) deriv_of_eqn:diff(eqn,x);
                        dy
(%o19)              2 y -- + 2 x = 0
                        dx
(%i20) solve(deriv_of_eqn,'diff(y,x));
                       dy     x
(%o20)                [-- = - -]
                       dx     y
</pre>
</p><p>
The other side of calculus is integration. The basic function to do that in
Maxima is called <tt  >integrate</tt>. This function can do both definite and
indefinite integrals. Indefinite integrals are the symbolic form of
integration you likely learned in school. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i21) integrate(x^2,x);
                           3
                          x
(%o21)                    -
                          3
</pre>
</p><p>
A definite integral actually is evaluated over an interval. This form of an
integral can be visualized as the area under the curve defined by the
equation you are integrating. To do definite integrals, simply add two
arguments giving the start and end points of the interval:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i22) integrate(x^2,x,0,1);
                          1
(%o22)                    -
                          3
</pre>
</p><p>
Putting all these techniques together, you can solve a differential
equation for a given variable&mdash;for example, solve dy/dx = f(x) for y. You can do
this by doing all the required algebra and calculus, but you don't
really need to. Maxima has the very powerful function,
<tt  >ode2</tt>, which can do
it in one step. Start with your equation:


<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i23) eq: 'diff(y,x) = sqrt(1/x^2 - 1/x^3);
                      dy        1    1
(%o23)                -- = sqrt(-- - --)
                      dx         2    3
                                x    x
(%i24) ode2(eq,y,x);
                                                     2
                          2                  2 sqrt(x - x)
(%o24)    y = log(2 sqrt(x - x) + 2 x - 1) - ------------- + %c
                                                   x
</pre>
</p><p>
This one function call does the integration and the solve steps and gives
you a final answer to the differential equation.
</p><p>
Let's say you're doing an experiment dropping a coin and timing how long it
takes to fall. How do you know whether the times you are measuring
actually make sense? Let's start with the most basic law:
force = mass * acceleration.
</p><p>
The mass of the coin is a constant, so ignore that for now. The force
is the force due to gravity, pulling the coin down to the ground, and
the acceleration describes the coin's motion due to this force. The force
due to gravity is a constant, at least here on Earth, and it depends
linearly on the mass, so you can define the force as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i1) force: mass * g;
(%o1)                g mass
</pre>
</p><p>
The acceleration also is a constant, because both the mass and the force are
constants. Acceleration is simply the rate of change of the velocity, and
the velocity is the rate of change of the position, so you can set that up
as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i2) depends(y,t);
(%o2)                [y(t)]
(%i3) acceleration: 'diff('diff(y,t),t);
                       2
                      d y
(%o3)                 ---
                        2
                      dt
</pre>
</p><p>
Putting it all together, you get:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i4) eq_of_motion: force = mass * acceleration;
                                        2
                                       d y
(%o4)                    g mass = mass ---
                                         2
                                       dt
(%i5) solve(eq_of_motion, y);
                            2
                           d y
(%o5)                     [--- = g]
                             2
                           dt
</pre>
</p><p>
You can see right away that how fast an object falls doesn't depend on the
mass at all. Galileo was right! The next step is to do some integrating and
see what you end up with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i6) integrate(%,t);
                 dy
(%o6)           [-- = g t + %c1]
                 dt
</pre>
</p><p>
At this step, you would be able to find out the velocity (dy/dt) at time t.
The additional term <tt  >%c1</tt> is a constant of
integration. In this case, you can
see that it represents the initial velocity of your penny. One more round of
integration gives this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i7) integrate(%,t);
                   /            2
                   [ dy      g t
(%o7)            [I  -- dt = ---- + %c1 t + %c2]
                   ] dt       2
                   /
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you can find the position, y, of your coin at any time, t. Again, a new
constant of integration is introduced, <tt  >%c2</tt>. In this
case, you can see that
this represents the starting height of your coin. But that's not what you
were measuring. You were measuring how long it took the coin to drop a given
distance. So you need to do a bit of rearranging. Because you are dropping
your
coin, you know that the start velocity is 0 (that is,
<tt  >%c1=0</tt>). You can rewrite
things a little to make it a bit clearer:


<pre     class="programlisting">
(%i8) eqn: y = (g * t^2)/2 + y0;
                                 2

There you go. You now have an equation for the time, given a height that
your coin is dropping. With this theoretical relation under your belt, you
can check to see whether gravity is working correctly in your local lab. If
not, you should contact the Nobel committee straightaway.

This only scratches the surface of
Maxima's capabilities in dealing with calculus and differential
equations, but hopefully, this article gives you a starting point.
Happy integrating.

<h2 class="title">Pint-Size PPA Primer</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #204, April 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Package management in Linux is great, but unfortunately, it comes with a
few cons. Granted, most distributions keep all your software, not just
system software like Apple and Microsoft, updated. The downside is that
software packages aren't always the latest versions. Whatever is in
the repository is what you get. Another frustration is when the software
you want to install isn't in the distribution repositories at all.
</p><p>
Usually, it's possible to add software packages, even if they're not in
the repos. For Red Hat-based systems, those are RPM files. For
Debian-based, they're DEBs. Unfortunately, installing applications that way doesn't
give you upgrades when they're available; you need to keep them
updated yourself. Most package management systems also have the ability
to add third-party repos, but those don't always have the packages you want.
</p><p>
Canonical has a feature in newer versions of Ubuntu that allow the best of
both worlds. They're called PPAs (Personal Package Archives). Instead of
distributing .deb files, developers simply can distribute their PPAs.
With a PPA, the software is updated automatically along with being
installed in the first place. While installing PPAs hopefully
will become simpler, in the short term, they're still pretty easy to install.
You just need to find the right PPA structure, usually given by the
developers that support the idea. For example, to install the Mozilla
Daily Build PPA, simply type:


<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-mozilla-daily/ppa
</pre>
</p><p>
Someday, installing a third-party application will be as easy in Linux as it
is in Windows and Macintosh. With ideas like PPA repositories, however,
your software will stay updated. And, that sounds P-P-Perfect
to me.

<h2 class="title">Get Green, with Brown!</h2>

The folks at Recompute have taken the notion of &ldquo;Going Green&rdquo; to a whole new
level. They've made computer cases out of recyclable cardboard. We had
the pleasure of speaking with Recompute's Brenden
Macaluso and took one of their computers for a test-drive.
Here's what we found:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The computers living inside the cardboard boxes are actually quite
functional. Although they're not super-fast gaming machines, the computer options
aren't just a bunch of low-end Atom machines.
</p></li><li><p>
The cases feel sturdy. We were leery about using a computer case made of
cardboard, but it didn't feel flimsy at all.
</p></li><li><p>
Although a cardboard case doesn't make the computer internals any more
recyclable, it does actually make it easier to recycle those innards.
They literally rip right out.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
There are many skeptics when it comes to the Recompute idea. Some see the
cardboard case as a gimmick, and some think a computer wrapped in brown
craft paper is a fire hazard. If you have questions about the Recompute
computer, check out the FAQ on the Web site: <a href="http://www.recomputepc.com" target="_self">www.recomputepc.com</a>.

<h2 class="title">Drop Your Dropbox and SparkleShare Instead!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #204, April 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
We love Dropbox here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>. It's cross-platform, offers
a decent free offering and generally &ldquo;just works&rdquo;. It has some
problems though. Dropbox is proprietary. Dropbox stores a copy
of your data in its own data repositories. Dropbox is limited in size,
especially with its free accounts.
</p><p>
Enter SparkleShare. SparkleShare is an open-source project that allows
you to start a Dropbox-like service on your own. It's a very new project
and needs time to mature, but the beta is promising. Also,
because you run the server yourself, there are no limits to the amount of
data you can store. It's also cross-platform and has some of the same
sharing features offered by its proprietary brother.
</p><p>
Check out the early stages of SparkleShare at <a href="http://www.sparkleshare.org" target="_self">www.sparkleshare.org</a>, and
if you're a programmer, consider contributing. I'm excited for a stable
alternative to Dropbox that I can host myself.

Some people have told me they don't think a fat penguin really embodies
the grace of Linux, which just tells me they have never seen an angry
penguin charging at them in excess of 100 mph. They'd be a lot more
careful about what they say if they had.

This month, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> focuses on my favorite topic: Web
development. We've compiled a fantastic collection of information
here in the pages of this issue, and I look forward to learning a
thing or two along with you.
</p><p>
With the recent release of Drupal 7, I am excited to focus my
attention once again on making significant improvements to
LinuxJournal.com, and I hope you'll check in from time to time to see
what's new on-line. A new major Drupal release is a great excuse to
take a look at things that could use improvement on our site, as well
as add new features to improve the overall experience for our readers.
 With the numerous improvements in Drupal 7 beckoning, I can't wait to
get started on what should be the best version of LinuxJournal.com
yet.
</p><p>
Web development best practices are constantly evolving, and we all
struggle to stay current or even ahead of the curve. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>
and LinuxJournal.com are two important sources of the knowledge
necessary to keep up with Web technology trends. Join us on-line at
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/tag/web-development" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/tag/web-development</a> to find a wealth of information
in one place. See you in the comment queue?
