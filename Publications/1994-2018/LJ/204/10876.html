The ultimate in open-source e-book management.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26cc580.0x27c4408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I've got e-books&mdash;a lot of e-books. I was one of those geeks who, when he
found Projects Gutenberg and Perseus, was convinced the Rapture would happen
tomorrow because life had reached its highest pinnacle on the celestial plains.
</p><p>
If the rapture didn't happen, nuclear war might. So I wanted to make sure I'd
have all the books I could get my hands on. When Fictionwise and Tor started
giving books away, I was there too. When non-DRM-encumbered books became
available through Smashwords, I started picking them up as I could afford them.
Ditto for Doctorow's stuff and other e-books by friends of mine&mdash;and let's
not even mention the hundreds of NASA, Navy and Army manuals I use for
research.
</p><p>
Fast-forward 13 years since discovering Project Perseus, and I have more e-books
than I really know how to deal with. More than an embarrassment of riches, it
was a bloody mess and high time to do something about it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26cc580.0x27c4670"></a>
E-book Management: the Old Way</h2></div></div><p>
Generation one of my library organization project went the way any competent,
non-database-designing sysadmin would do it: with a sensible directory structure.
After many hours, I wound up with a system that was excellent for nonfiction,
but crap for fiction. After all, the best you can do with a good directory
tree is break out by genre, author and series. That's adequate for reference
materials, but not great for the inevitable &ldquo;hmmm...what do I want to
read next?&rdquo;
</p><p>
A good library needs good metadata, and directory structures have squat.
E-book management software that ships with many readers attempt to do this, but
they tend to have proprietary ties to devices and operating systems.
They're usually not Linux-friendly, and they're also not very friendly to collection longevity.
DRM? Proprietary formats? Thank you, no.
</p><p>
What I needed was something like iTunes or Amarok, but with a decent interface,
designed for books. Fortunately, I wasn't the only person with this
problem.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26cc580.0x27c4880"></a>
E-book Management: the New Way</h2></div></div><p>
Enter Calibre, the Python-based, data-fetching, universally device-compatible
e-book management and conversion program. The product specs are ambitious, and
the implementation is, though occasionally bumpy, pretty darn spectacular.
</p><p>
Unlike most proprietary, device-specific management programs, Calibre converts
all major formats into one another (I do not know how it handles DRM, as at the
time of this writing the DMCA overthrow has just come down&mdash;happy
day!&mdash;so any such features are as yet undocumented), and allows
medium-grained metadata control over all of them. For fine-grained metadata
control, you need more specialized tools, or you need to edit the files
directly with a compatible editor. For example, Sigil does this quite splendidly for EPUB.
For households with multiple species of e-readers, this is a must.
</p><p>
Calibre also can autopopulate your library's metadata, pulling it down from a
number of different on-line databases by title, author and ISBN.
</p><p>
It allows rating, so you can keep track of how much you liked your book.
</p><p>
It has a very handsome cover art browser.
</p><p>
It can store Open Document Format files as e-books and create metadata for
them. This gives it the nice unintended utility as a version control system
for authors.
</p><p>
It comes with a native e-book reader that allows limited annotations and can
view a number of the supported formats. For those formats that Calibre does
not support reading directly, it will launch your operating system's default
viewer with the click of a button.
</p><p>
It also nests multiple formats of the same book under the same entry in the
database and directory structure, so when you convert, say, a PDF to Kindle
format for your Kindle, you don't have duplicate titles popping up in your book
list.
</p><p>
It syncs to more than 20 different makes and models of e-book reader and also
allows you to access most readers (even the unsupported ones) in mass storage
mode, so you're future-proofed if you change reader platforms later on.
</p><p>
So, what are we waiting for?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26cc580.0x27c4cf8"></a>
Fetching</h2></div></div><p>
Calibre can be found at an uncommonly well-designed Web site:
<a href="http://www.calibre-ebook.com" target="_self">www.calibre-ebook.com</a>. Click the download button, select Linux from the
following screen (you'll notice that it also runs on Mac and Windows&mdash;a plus
for those of us with multiplatform networks), and read the following screen
first.
</p><p>
Calibre is picky about the dependencies; the glibc and Python versions are
particularly important. Recent distributions are all in compliance, but older
distros might require some updating to work properly (you also may need to
compile them yourself&mdash;a fairly trivial undertaking&mdash;of course, your mileage may
vary).
</p><p>
Assuming you're in compliance, copy the code from the code window into your
root terminal (you must run the install as root; otherwise, it tends to fail
with nasty comments about your intelligence, heritage and recreational
proclivities), and press Enter. If all goes well, a new item should appear in
your window manager's start menu. If it didn't, you most likely missed a
dependency.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26cc580.0x27c4f08"></a>
Getting to Know Calibre</h2></div></div><p>
Calibre's project manager Kovid Goyal deserves a big pat on the back (and tips
in the tip jar). Not only is the program organized well, the Web site easily
navigable, and the installation relatively painless, but the documentation is
very comprehensive as well.
</p><p>
When you open Calibre, you're presented with the main interface screen
(Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10876f1.large.jpg"><img src="10876f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Calibre Interface
</p></div></div><p>
You'll notice the unique interface concept. There is no standard menu
bar&mdash;just a toolbar with a few basic buttons and drop-downs under the buttons to
allow you access to finer-grained controls on each of those tools.
</p><p>
Starting at the top left is the button that starts it all: Add
Books. The list box attached to it gives you the option to add a single
book, add a directory or a nested directory structure, or to add an empty entry
into the database that you can populate later. This last option is useful if
you're also adding your physical books to the collection&mdash;it can serve as a
placeholder with instructions on where the book is shelved.
</p><p>
Moving along to the right is the metadata tool. This is the heart and
soul of your database. The metadata are all your obvious tags: ISBN, Author,
Series name, Publisher, Copyright date, Publication date for that edition
and so on.
It also includes the cover art, the listing of the different formats in
which you have
the book, a comments field and a tags field. Fetching metadata from the
remote server populates the fields for you, not including the cover art,
and it puts the back-of-book copy in the comments field and the genre in
the tags field. Downloading the cover art pulls the cover art linked to
that ISBN from the ISBN or Google Book servers. If you get art for
an edition you didn't intend, you always can replace it by hand.
</p><p>
Pushing the metadata button brings up the metadata edit
screen for the individual book you have selected (Figure 2). Using the drop-down list,
you can act upon the metadata of multiple selected books in a variety of ways
using batch functions&mdash;most handy.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10876f2.large.jpg"><img src="10876f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Editing Metadata
</p></div></div><p>
The third button is the conversion tool, which lets you translate one
format into another&mdash;very handy for devices like the Kindle, which reads
only one kind of proprietary file format. You can translate EPUBS,
properly formatted PDFs (some formatting conventions, like headers and footers,
can cause major headaches), OpenOffice.org documents and so on, into Kindle AZWs for
easy viewing on your Kindle. In many cases, the default settings are quite
adequate, but for the occasions when they're not, the tool gives you direct
access to the document's structure and several of the XML wild cards. This is
the one section of the program that, at the time of this writing, is not well
documented, so you'll need to experiment if you're getting wonky results
from the default conversion.
</p><p>
The drop-down list also gives you the option of creating a device-exportable
library catalog&mdash;handy for those who like to compare book lists with their
friends or who, like me, are simply nuts for library catalogs. (Don't laugh,
there are more of us than you think, and we live on the Internet with vast
botnets at our beck and call. Taunt us at your own risk.)
</p><p>
Next is the View button, which is fairly self-explanatory.
Clicking it opens the default viewer for the highest-priority format in which
the book is available. Clicking on the list box gives you the further option
to view a specific format rather than just using the one Calibre picks for you
by the numbers.
</p><p>
Next up, there's a button curiously entitled Fetch News. This is
actually a very sophisticated RSS reader, and it comes preloaded with more
than a
thousand news feeds in various languages. If your e-reader doesn't have Wi-Fi or
3G, and you want to batch-spool up your morning news or blogs, this is the tool
for you. It can pull down anything with an RSS feed, so you always can have
the latest installment of Doctorow's current novel added to your library as
soon as it's released.
</p><p>
Clicking the button brings up the scheduling window if you don't have anything
scheduled yet (here you set the download schedule) or it grabs all queued
downloads if you have them scheduled. Using the drop-down menu lets you fetch
the news and customize the feeds by creating &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; for your
specific news-reading needs (basically, a list of RSS feeds and the way you want
them to appear in your customized electronic newspaper).
</p><p>
The next button along is your device controller. It syncs your selected
reading list with your e-reading device. The drop-down menu lets you select
the particular driver (if autodetection is not working properly) and tweak other
sync settings.
</p><p>
If your device isn't recognized, due to driver problems, kernel issues or the
device being so new there isn't a driver for it yet, fear not. The next button
is Save To Disk, which will save the selected books to any location in
your file tree that you please, including a USB mass storage device, such as
your e-reader's internal Flash memory. When using this option, you'll usually
need to reboot the device so that it rescans its file tree and updates its
database accordingly.
</p><p>
Next is the Remove Books button, which also is self-explanatory. The drop-down
gives you the option to remove singles, multiples, specific formats
contained within the selected titles only, cover art only, or to remove
the selected books from the attached device, but not from the library.
</p><p>
Finally, there's the Preferences button, which brings up the granddaddy of
all dialogs (Figure 3). This is the beating heart of the operation, offering lower-level
access to the database, debug functions, conversion defaults and a bunch of
other stuff. Most interesting, perhaps, is the Calibre server setup, which
allows Calibre to operate like a remote library system for other computers on
your network (or on the Internet, if you often experience the sudden need for
one of your e-books while at the office). Pretty much everything in here,
sophisticated though it is, is self-explanatory.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10876f3.large.jpg"><img src="10876f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Preferences Screen
</p></div></div><p>
Below the button bar, there's a field listing the available
collections. Calibre can support multiple libraries, and this is where you
switch between them. Below that, there's a search bar. It doesn't search
within the books, alas, but it does search the metadata quite effectively.
</p><p>
Moving down again, is the library itself. In the left pane, you'll find
the available hierarchies&mdash;Authors, Publishers, Tags, formats and
ratings. It offers all of these as pre-sorted searches, and clicking on them
will modify the list you see in the center pane.
</p><p>
The center pane is your library itself. All the metadata is listed in
easy-to-read rows of alternating colors. You can organize them alphabetically
by any of the available fields simply by clicking on the column title, just as
you can do with any spreadsheet or other list-driven program.
</p><p>
The rightmost pane shows you the cover art and a quick rundown on the book
currently highlighted. File types, comments and so on all appear here.
</p><p>
Finally, along the bottom of the screen are three buttons that control the
layout of the program. Toggling these three buttons turns on and off
different panes on the screen. The one that's turned off in my default layout
is the graphical bookshelf (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10876f4.large.jpg"><img src="10876f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Graphical Bookshelf Browser
</p></div></div><p>
This handy interface allows you to flip through the list as it appears
(search-restricted and all), like you'd flip through books on a
bookshelf.
Clicking left shuffles to items farther up the list, clicking right shuffles to
items farther down the list.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26cc580.0x2bbe128"></a>
Building the Library</h2></div></div><p>
If you're anything like me, you probably have some kind of e-book library
already, so you'll want to start off by importing what you've got.
Because Calibre's library import feature does some destructive rewriting, it's
worth creating a backup copy of your library, just in case.
</p><p>
After importing, you're going to have books in your list&mdash;maybe a lot of
books. And, because most e-book metadata tends to be poor, the books in your
list are probably haphazard and not well organized.
</p><p>
Organizing them can be a laborious process, but there are a few ways to make
the job less irritating&mdash;bulk-editing the metadata is chief among them, as
mentioned earlier. For example, if you had 20 titles by the same author,
you could select all of them, right-click on one of them, and select Bulk Edit
Metadata from the pop-up menu. In the resulting screen, you can set the
author, genre tags, publisher tag and most (but not all) other data fields to
help with your sort. You also can check a little box that says Swap Author
and Title fields. This one is particularly useful, as many poorly tagged
e-books are tagged with these fields the wrong way around.
</p><p>
Once the organization is done to your satisfaction, you're good to go.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26cc580.0x2bbe338"></a>
Weaknesses and Caveats</h2></div></div><p>
As shining as the program is in most respects, it comes up short in a
couple areas. 
</p><p>
The first, and most annoying, is one that is only partly the responsibility of
the development team. The USB stack under the most recent versions of the
Linux kernel has been occasionally glitchy. As a result, several recent
distributions, including one of the ones I run, have had trouble syncing to
external devices. The device would show up as a mass storage device, but
attempting to access the device's internal database resulted in crashes, nasty
core dumps, segfaults and the occasional exploding computer.
</p><p>
In the most recent kernel versions, this seems no longer to be a problem, but
if you encounter it and can't upgrade your kernel or distro, you can usually
fall back to mass storage mode and hand-sync your books through the Save
To Disk button.
</p><p>
My other gripe is that there's only one comment field. The ability to deeply
annotate books or keep reviews on books simply isn't there. This
will cramp the style of research junkies and avid bookworms alike.
Hopefully,
this will be remedied in future versions (it's not like there is any shortage
of potential metadata fields).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26cc580.0x2bbe548"></a>
Wrap-Up</h2></div></div><p>
Calibre is the best-of-breed solution currently on offer for any platform, and
it is well worth the download if you've got an e-book collection numbering
more than a
dozen, or if you've been trying to figure out some way to manage things on your
Sony, Nook or Kindle without having to boot the Windows image.
Enjoy!
