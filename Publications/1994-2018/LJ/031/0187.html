    There are times when the command line interface is still a
    very good choice for getting things done.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a7f580.0x1b77608"></a></h2></div></div><p>&ldquo;It's a GUI, GUI, GUI, GUI world!&rdquo;&mdash;or
so the major OS manufacturers would have you believe. The truth is
that while this is increasingly the case, there are times when the
command line interface (CLI) is still a very good choice for
getting things done. It's fast, generally efficient, and is a good
choice on memory or CPU constrained machines. And don't forget,
there are still a lot of very nifty things that can be done
<span   class="emphasis"><em>at the console</em></span>.
</p><p>In this spirit, I'd like to start by following up on a
delightful and informative article written by Alessandro Rubini
entitled &ldquo;The Best Without X&rdquo; in the November 1995 issue (#19) of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>. Among a wealth of helpful
ideas, Alessandro suggested converting the numeric keypad into a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>console-switch scratch pad</em></span> to allow single key
switching from one virtual terminal (VT) to another. We'll begin by
looking at how this conversion can be done. We'll also look
at:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Getting from Here to There: handy methods for VT
cruising</p></li><li><p>The Useful Unused VT: where to put all that logging
information, and where X-Windows really ends up</p></li></ul></div><p>By the time that you get through tinkering around with these
things I think you'll agree that the CLI isn't such a bad place
after all. Also, the good news is that the programs you'll need to
do this conversion are standard inclusions in most recent Linux
distributions and include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>kbd 0.91 (keyboard font and utility
programs)</p></li><li><p>utils 2.5 (Rick Faith's huge collection of
utilities)</p></li><li><p>GNU shell-utils 1.12 (shell utilities including the
<b  >stty</b> program)</p></li></ul></div><p>A listing of Linux FTP archives where these utilities can be
found is included in the
<a href="0187s1.html" target="_self">sidebar</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a7f580.0x1b77df0"></a>The Keypad VT-Switcher</h2></div></div><p>The numeric keypad is an ideal candidate for re-mapping into
a virtual terminal-switching scratch pad since most of us have
never learned &ldquo;ten-key by touch&rdquo;. In addition, the non-numeric
functions on a 101-key keyboard are already duplicated by the home,
end, page up, page down, insert, delete and arrow keys. Since there
may be occasions in which we still want to use the keypad for
numeric input, let's see how to set it up as a VT switcher while
retaining numeric input ability. You'll need to have the kbd
package installed on your system. The two programs we'll be using
are <span   class="bold"><b>showkey</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>loadkey</b></span>. To check whether they are
installed on your system type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ type loadkeys showkey
</pre><p>if you're using the BASH shell, or:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ which loadkeys showkey
</pre><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>which</b></span> program or the
BASH shell built-in function <span   class="bold"><b>type</b></span>
will both print the path to the executable if they exist in the
PATH search path. On my machine this produces:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ type showkey loadkeys
showkey is /usr/bin/showkey
loadkeys is /usr/bin/loadkeys
</pre><pre     class="programlisting">
$ which showkey loadkeys
/usr/bin/showkey
/usr/bin/loadkeys
</pre><p>If you don't have these programs installed, you'll need to
get the the kbd package source, and install it yourself. This
package is available only as source code, but installation is as
simple as un-archiving it into a temporary directory, then
typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre><p>Converting the keypad into a VT switcher involves defining a
keyboard mapping and using loadkeys to actually load this
information into the kernel keyboard translation tables. It's
easier than it sounds&mdash;although you must keep in mind that
indiscriminate tinkering can render your keyboard useless
(requiring one of those dreaded cold reboots), and that changing
the keyboard translation tables affects
<span   class="bold"><b>ALL</b></span> VTs, not just the one you're
working on. The kbd package's default installation location is
under /usr/lib/kbd, with the key mapping files in the keytables
subdirectory. Change to this directory and make a copy of the
defkeymap.map file, which contains the default keyboard mapping and
is a useful place to begin. You can name the new file anything
you'd like&mdash;e.g.,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cp defkeymap.map custom.map
</pre><p>Use your favorite editor and load up the copied file. At this
point it's probably helpful to have a look around at the current
contents. The experience is rather like visiting one of those fine
old curio shops&mdash;look, but don't touch! The first few lines may
look something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
keycode   1 = Escape  Escape
    alt keycode   1 = Meta_Escape
keycode   2 = one  exclam
    alt keycode   2 = Meta_one
    shift   alt keycode   2 = Meta_exclam
keycode   3 = two   at   at
    control keycode   3 = nul
    shift   control keycode   3 = nul
    alt keycode   3 = Meta_two
    shift   alt keycode   3 = Meta_at
</pre><p>I won't go into all the gory details of how to re-map the
keyboard except to say that the basic format to use is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
keycode keynumber = keysym
    modifier keycode keynumber = keysym
</pre><p>in which <span   class="emphasis"><em>keynumber</em></span> is the internal
identification number of the key and <span   class="emphasis"><em>keysym</em></span>
represents the action to take. Now, before you bail out on me,
let's put this into simple terms. Each key on the keyboard is
identified by a unique number which is represented by
<span   class="emphasis"><em>keynumber</em></span>. When a key is pressed or released,
the press or release event is passed to the operating system, which
responds by performing the appropriate action&mdash;represented here by
<span   class="emphasis"><em>keysym</em></span>. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>modifier</em></span> is a
key which is held down at the same time that the key is pressed.
These <span   class="emphasis"><em>modifier</em></span> keys include the well-known
control, alt and shift keys. The ability to define multi-key
combinations extends the mapping available for each key.</p><p>So, using the example above, pressing the key associated with
keynumber 3 actually causes the number <b  >2</b> to be
printed to the screen. If the shift key is held down at the same
time as the key is pressed, the <b  >@</b> sign is
printed to the screen, and if the three key combination shift-alt-3
is pressed, the output is the Meta_at (whatever that looks
like).</p><p>Getting back to the task at hand, we want to change to a
specified VT when we press one of the keypad keys: i.e., pressing
keypad 1 should switch to VT number 1, pressing keypad 2 should
switch to VT number 2, etc. In your customized key map file find
the section that defines the keypad keys&mdash;it should look similar to
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
keycode  71 = KP_7
    alt keycode  71 = Ascii_7
keycode  72 = KP_8
    alt keycode  72 = Ascii_8
keycode  73 = KP_9
    alt keycode  73 = Ascii_9
[...]
</pre><p>Now, edit this section so that it reads something like
<a href="0187l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>.</p><p>Before continuing, let's make a couple of observations.
First, it's not a bad idea to comment the file as you go. What
seems clear and obvious now fades into obscurity as the weeks pass.
Adding comments now will prevent your having to pore over manual
pages, program documentation and magazine articles later, looking
for the correct syntax or usage. Second, notice that with each
entry there are <span   class="emphasis"><em>sub-stanzas</em></span>, beginning with
the words <b  >alt keycode</b>, <b  >shift
keycode</b>, etc. These stanzas define multi-key combinations
in which a <span   class="emphasis"><em>modifier</em></span> key is pressed at the same
time as the key being defined. A common example of this is the
crtl-c combination used to terminate a program during
execution.</p><p>Finally, you may be asking yourself how you're supposed to
know which keynumber is associated with a key. Does anyone know
off-hand what keynumber goes with the <b  >;</b> key? You
can find this out by using the showkey program. After you invoke
the program, showkey will print the keynumber for any key you press
and will quit after 10 seconds of no input. So, now that we've
edited the pertinent section in the custom.map file, let's see how
we'd arrive at this <span   class="emphasis"><em>from scratch</em></span>. The basic
steps would be:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Find the keynumber for the keypad keys.</p></li><li><p>Edit the customized mapping for the keys so that
pressing them would change to the appropriate VT.</p></li><li><p>Edit the customized mapping for the keys so that
the keypad could still be used for numeric input (using a modifier
key combination in this case).</p></li><li><p>Load the customized mapping and see whether it
works.</p></li><li><p>Optionally, have the default key mapping loaded at
system boot.</p></li></ul></div><p>To do this, let's begin by invoking the showkey
program:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ showkey
</pre><p>Now, any key you press causes showkey to print the keynumber.
On my machine, invoking showkey and pressing keypad keys 1 through
9 results in the output shown in <a href="0187l2.html" target="_self">Listing
2</a>. You can see that both key press and key release events
are detected. Also note that the numbering of the keypad keys is
not sequential. The numeric keys have the format shown in Table
1:</p><p>Table 1</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Actual Key:                 Keynumber:
7    8    9                 71   72   73
4    5    6                 75   76   77
1    2    3                 79   80   81
</pre><p>Table 1 shows that keypad number 1 has keynumber 79, keypad
number 2 has keynumber 80, etc, Knowing this, we can set up the
appropriate key map entry for each of these keys. The keysym event
that we're interested in is Console_<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>, in
which <span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> is the number of the VT to which the
view is switched. A simple entry to map keypad number 1 to
switching to VT 1 would look like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
keycode 79 = Console_1
</pre><p>If you look at <a href="0187l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>,
you'll notice that this is what we've done. Suppose, however, we
wanted to switch to a VT greater than 9&mdash;how are we to do that? The
solution is to use a modifier key combination. Looking again at the
example above, using the shift key with the keypad allows us to use
Console_10 through Console_19. We also wanted to be able to use the
numeric keypad as just that&mdash;a means of entering numeric data. In
the example above, notice that the modifier <b  >alt</b>
was used to do this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
keycode  71 = Console_7
    shift       keycode  71 = Console_17
    alt         keycode  71 = KP_7
    alt control keycode  71 = Console_7
</pre><p>In this stanza for the keypad_7 key, the first entry maps the
keypad_7 key to switch to VT 7. The second line maps shift-keypad_7
to switch to VT 17 and the third line maps the alt-keypad_7
combination to KP_7 which is the keysym for numeric output when num
lock is <span   class="emphasis"><em>on</em></span>. Thus, to use the keypad as a
numeric keypad, press the num lock key so that it toggles to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>on</em></span>, then hold down the alt key while you enter
numbers at the keypad. Note, too, that
alt-crtl-<span   class="emphasis"><em>keypad</em></span> was defined to switch to the
same console as simply pressing the keypad key itself. In this
case, it acts in exactly the same fashion as the
alt-f<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> (alt-<span   class="emphasis"><em>Function_key</em></span>)
or alt-crtl-f<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> (alt-crtl-<span   class="emphasis"><em>Function
key</em></span>) combination. You may have noticed that using the
function keys is how one is typically instructed to switch from one
VT to another. Looking at the stanzas for the function keys you'll
notice entries such as the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
keycode  59 = F1    F13    Console_13
    control keycode  59 = F25
    shift   control keycode  59 = F37
    alt keycode  59 = Console_1
    control alt keycode  59 = Console_1
</pre><p>Note that both alt-f1 and alt-crtl-f1 are used to switch to
VT 1. Those of you using X will probably already have found that
switching to a VT from X requires the three key
alt-crtl-f<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> key combination while the two key
alt-f<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> key combination is used at the console.
Although you can change this default behavior, it's best not to. At
this point, we've defined mappings for the keypad keys such that
each key acts as a switch to the VT of the same number. Using
shift-<span   class="emphasis"><em>keypad_key</em></span> switches to VT (10 + keypad
number) and using alt-<span   class="emphasis"><em>keypad key</em></span> with the num
lock <span   class="emphasis"><em>on</em></span> outputs the numeric value of the key.
The final step is to actually load the new mapping and give it a
try. The loading is done using loadkeys and can be done without
logging on as root. To load the customized keymap, enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ loadkeys /usr/lib/kbd/keytables/custom.map
</pre><p>This will print a message indicating that the custom.map file
is being loaded. After this, you're all set! Give it a try. To
revert back to the default mapping simply enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ loadkeys /usr/lib/kbd/keytables/defkeymap.map
</pre><p>and the default mappings will be loaded once again. You can
use this edit -&gt; load customized map -&gt; test -&gt; load
default map cycle to obtain the desired mapping. Once you've
created a custom map file and wish to have it loaded at boot, you
can add an entry to one of the rc.* files, such as rc.local, to
have loadkeys automatically load your customized mapping:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if [ -r /usr/lib/kbd/keytables/custom.map ]; then
     loadkeys /usr/lib/kbd/keytables/custom.map
fi
</pre><p>This entry ensures that the file is present and readable and
invokes loadkeys to load the file. Again, keep in mind that loading
a key mapping changes the keytable information for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> VTs, not just your current one.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a7f580.0x1b705c8"></a>Getting from Here to There</h2></div></div><p>Now that we're on a bit of a roll, let's look at another
method for moving from one VT to another. The utility of being able
to quickly switch from one VT to another should be obvious: you can
be compiling a program on VT 1, editing a file on VT 2, reading
program documentation on VT 3 and having a manual page displayed on
VT 4. Now that you've re-mapped the keypad, switching from one VT
to the next is as simple as pressing the keypad keys. But there are
other handy means of getting around as well and these
include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Using the keysym functions Last_Console,
Incr_Console and Decr_Console</p></li><li><p>Using the chvt program (which is part of the kbd
package)</p></li></ul></div><p>The Incr_Console and Decr_Console keysym functionsdo as their
names imply: they switch to (VT + 1) or (VT - 1) respectively. So,
if you were currently working at VT 3, the Incr_Console keysym
would switch you to VT 4 while the Decr_Console keysym would switch
you to VT 2. The Last_Console keysym also does as its name implies:
it switches to the last VT used. If you were working at VT 3 and
switched to VT 6, the Last_Console keysym would switch you back to
VT 3. You can map a key or modifier+key combination to invoke any
of these keysym functions. I've mapped these functions as
follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Ctrl+left arrow  = Decr_Console
Ctrl+right arrow = Incr_Console
keypad 0         = Last_Console
</pre><p>Obviously, you can map these functions in any manner you
wish, but the relevant entries to map the above actions would
be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#keycode  82 = KP_0
keycode  82 = Last_Console
    shift keycode  82 = Console_10
    alt   keycode  82 = KP_0
[...]
keycode 105 = Left
    alt keycode 105 = Decr_Console
keycode 106 = Right
    alt keycode 106 = Incr_Console
</pre><p>These entries map the keypad 0 key to the Last_Console keysym
and the alt- [left arrow] or [right arrow] to Decr_Console or
Incr_Console keysyms. The good news is that these last two are
already the default so that you have to edit only the stanza for
the keypad 0 key. Now, you can quickly cycle through all the VTs by
holding down the alt key and repeatedly pressing the left or right
arrow. To alternate between two VTs you have only to repeatedly
press the keypad 0 key. I've found these particular mappings to be
quite useful but, as I mentioned before, they can be customized to
anything you wish. The last bit of VT cruising magic is the chvt
program included with the kbd package. Its use is quite
simple:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ chvt 3
</pre><p>would change to VT 3. Substituting another number for
<b  >3</b> allows you to change to that VT. A
foreshortened version of this can be set up using a shell
alias:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ alias vt='chvt'
</pre><p>so that entering:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ vt 3
</pre><p>would switch you to VT 3.</p><p>So, now that we've defined several methods of getting from VT
to VT it is important to note that this works only at the console
and not under the X Window System. Under X, the X server takes
control of the keyboard, mouse, and display: setting up customized
keyboard mappings is performed using the ~/.Xmodmap file or the
program xkeycaps and is a subject for a later article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a7f580.0x1b70d00"></a>The Useful Unused VT</h2></div></div><p>Having the capacity to open multiple VTs and to have programs
running on them in the foreground or background is one of the
things that makes running Linux such a huge amount of fun. As the
old Surgery Prof used to harangue his interns, &ldquo;Help me, help me!
If I had another set of hands I'd help myself!&rdquo; Linux gives you
that extra &ldquo;set of hands&rdquo;. Generally, most VTs, to be useful,
must have a <span   class="bold"><b>getty</b></span> process running
on them in order to log in. A getty is a program associated with a
terminal that:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Opens the tty line and sets its mode.</p></li><li><p>Prints the login prompt and gets the user's
name.</p></li><li><p>Initiates the login process for the user.</p></li></ul></div><p>Without going into all the details (again, a subject for a
later article), suffice it to say that this program is set up in
the /etc/inittab file. An entry for a getty might look like
<a href="0187l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>.</p><p>The important thing to note in this listing is that the
agetty program is run on each of the tty devices from tty1 to tty6.
Thus, at system startup there are a total of six gettys running,
allowing you to log into VT 1 through 6. So what about VT 7 and
beyond? Are they still usable in any way? If you've re-mapped your
keyboard&mdash;try pressing keypad_7&mdash;alternatively, press alt-f7&mdash;and
see what happens. In general, the screen is blank with the cursor
positioned at the upper left corner. You can type at the keyboard,
and the output is displayed on the screen. Despite this, there is
no way to execute programs at this terminal. A terminal you can't
log in on isn't much use. There are, however, two important
exceptions to this statement.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a7f580.0x1b711d0"></a>So Where Did X Go?</h2></div></div><p>The first exception to note is that when the X Window System
starts, it is displayed on the first unused tty&mdash;one that doesn't
have a getty running on it. Since the first six ttys had gettys
running on them, X would, in the example above, start on tty 7. Now
we know the solution to the great riddle, &ldquo;So where is X ?&rdquo;, when
you switch from X to a console. Pressing crtl-alt-f1 in X would
switch you to VT 1. If you wanted to get back to X, simply:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>press keypad_0 if you've mapped this to the
Last_Console keysym.</p></li><li><p>press keypad_7 to switch to VT 7 on which X is
running.</p></li><li><p>press alt-f7 to switch to VT 7.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a7f580.0x1b71540"></a>Putting That Unused VT to Work</h2></div></div><p>The other exception to note is that while you can't run
programs on a VT without logging in, you can still send output
there. As a simple experiment try the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo "This is a test" &gt; /dev/tty7
</pre><p>Switching to VT 7, you'll see the words &ldquo;This is a test&rdquo;
displayed. This ability becomes useful with system logging. Without
going into an exhaustive discussion of system logging and
configuration, it is worth noting that the output of all logging
facilities can be &ldquo;dumped&rdquo; to an unused VT which allows quick
perusal for events such as logins, kernel messages, mail logging,
etc. To do this simply add the following line to the
/etc/syslog.conf file (after logging in as root):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# this one will log ALL messages to the
#/dev/tty9 terminal since this is an unused
# terminal at the moment. This way, we
# don't need to hang a getty on it or take up
# a lot of system resources.
*.*                     /dev/tty9
</pre><p>Once you've added this stanza to /etc/syslog.conf, you'll
need to either kill and restart the syslog daemon or else send it
the HUP (hang up) signal. Since this latter method is fairly easy
let's do it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ps -x | grep syslog
28  ?  S     0:01 /usr/sbin/syslogd
</pre><p>will output the PID (process ID number) of the syslog daemon
which in this case is 28. Now, just type in:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ kill -HUP 28
</pre><p>in which <b  >28</b> is the PID number. The syslog
daemon will re-read its initialization files. From here on, all
logging that occurs, regardless of its source, will be output to
tty9 (or whichever tty device you specify).</p><p>Switching to VT 9 you might see something like the

failures&mdash;in this last case I purposely entered an incorrect

evident, but if you've ever noticed your machine thrashing about
and swapping like crazy, or, while on-line, your hard drive lights
begin to light up when you're not doing anything&mdash;a quick switch to
VT 9 can often give you an idea about what's going on. These
instructions should get you started. The manual pages for loadkeys,
showkey and keytables have much more complete technical
descriptions of key mapping. Also, the kbd package comes with a
good deal of helpful documentation in its /doc subdirectory. And
