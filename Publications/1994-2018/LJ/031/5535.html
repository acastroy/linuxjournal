    First in a series of articles detailing the creation of a
    Java interface to Postgres95.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb81580.0xc79240"></a></h2></div></div><p>Java's native methods are functions
written in C (or another compiled language) and dynamically loaded
by the Java interpreter at run time. They provide the means to
access libraries that have not been ported to Java, and also allow
fast compiled code to be inserted at critical points in your
system.
</p><p>In this article, we will walk through the complete process of
writing native code. We will create a Java interface to Postgres95
by writing wrapper classes around the libpq library. Postgres95 is
a free database system (licensed under the GPL) that runs on most
varieties of Unix, including Linux</p><p>While written (and tested) solely on Linux, the principles of
this article should apply to any version of Unix and (with the
exception of how to build the shared library) the code should be
easily ported. To get the most out of this article, you should have
some Java experience, or be very familiar with C++ and OO
principles.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb81580.0xc793f8"></a>An Introduction to Java</h2></div></div><p>Recently, Java has received a great deal of attention (and
quite a bit of hype) as a fantastic WWW tool. &ldquo;Java Powered&rdquo;
pages with animations and interactive interfaces have popped up all
over the Web, and everyone, including Microsoft (gasp!), is
clamoring to add Java capabilities to their browsers. What many
people don't realize is that Java is much more than that: it is a
complete programming language suitable for use in standalone and,
in particular, client-server applications.
</p><p>Java offers several features that make it ideal for an
application language. First among these is obviously portability.
With Java there is no need to write Windows95, Mac, and several
Unix versions of your application. Since the code is run by the
Java Virtual Machine (VM), all that is necessary is that the VM
(and any native libraries you want to use) be ported to that
platform.</p><p>Another compelling reason to write in Java is the depth of
its libraries (&ldquo;packages&rdquo; in Java-speak): networking, I/O,
containers, and a complete windowing system are all integrated.
Many of these capabilities are &ldquo;crippled&rdquo; when running a Java
applet, but applications are free to make complete use of all of
them. Java is a multi-threaded environment, allowing safe use of
threads on platforms that don't currently support them natively.
Java has a garbage collection system that eliminates the need for
explicit freeing of memory. Exception handling is built in (and its
use is actually required by many of the libraries, including the
one we will write), and its true OO nature eases inheritance and
re-use.</p><p><a href="5535s1.html" target="_self">Sidebar: Class Repositories: the
Motivation behind Jgres</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb81580.0xc79660"></a>Interfacing Java with Existing Systems</h2></div></div><p>Even with all these things going for it, using Java for an
application still has one major drawback: many systems don't yet
have a Java interface, and writing them from scratch is often
difficult, or even impossible.</p><p>This is the problem I faced when I wanted to access a
Postgres95 database from Java. There was an excellent (and simple)
C library (libpq) that shipped with Postgres95, but no support
whatsoever for Java. Since the source (in this case) was available,
I considered recreating libpq under Java, but this proved to be a
substantial chore, and required intimate knowledge of Postgres
internals. (In fact, as of this writing, John Kelly of the
Blackdown Organization is writing just such a beast. It's called
the Java-Postgres95 project, and you can find an alpha version at
ftp://java.blackdown.org/pub/Java.</p><p>Then I decided to simply write wrapper classes for libpq.
There are several drawbacks to this approach: First, it cannot be
used in an applet. Browsers explicitly disallow any access to
native code (except those provided with the browser), so these
classes simply will not work. Second (and more importantly), this
solution is not as portable as one written in straight Java. While
libpq is portable to all major flavors of Unix, and the code we'll
write will be as well, there is currently no libpq for Windows95/NT
or the Mac.</p><p>Apart from being simpler, there is one other advantage to
writing this in native code: When the Postgres95 project releases
bug fixes or changes their communication protocol, little or no
change will be required to our code.</p><p><a href="5535s2.html" target="_self">Sidebar: How to get Postgres and
Java</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb81580.0xc79920"></a>The Battle Plan</h2></div></div><p>We will proceed in three steps, providing examples of how to
use each part along the way.</p><p>First, we'll create wrappers for libpq's PGconn, and
PGResult. This will allow us to connect to the database, issue
queries, and process the results.</p><p>Then, we'll write a new interface to Postgres95's Large
Objects (or blobs in other databases), using Java's Stream
classes.</p><p>Finally, we'll use Java's threads to provide an easy, behind
the scenes interface to Postgres95's asynchronous notification
system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb81580.0xc79b30"></a>Using Native Methods in Java</h2></div></div><p>Java methods (class functions) that have been declared
&ldquo;native&rdquo; allow programmers to access code in a shared library.
Theoretically, this code can be written in any language that will
&ldquo;link with C&rdquo; (but in general, you'll probably want to stick to
C, or perhaps C++).</p><p>When a Java class is loaded, it can explicitly tell the Java
system to load any shared library (.sos in Linux) into the system.
Java uses the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH (and ldconfig)
to search for the library, and will then use that library to
resolve any methods that have been declared &ldquo;native&rdquo;.</p><p>The general procedure for writing native code is as
follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Write the .java file, declaring all native methods
as &ldquo;native&rdquo; (The .java file must compile cleanly at this point,
so insert dummy methods if you need to)</p></li><li><p>Add the <b  >loadLibrary()</b> command to
your .java files to tell Java to load the shared library</p></li><li><p>Compile the class:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        javac [-g] classname.java
</pre></li><li><p>Generate the headers and stubs:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        javah classname (no extension)
</pre><pre     class="programlisting">
        javah -stubs classname
</pre></li><li><p>Use the declarations in the classname.h file to
write your C code (I use the file classnameNative.c, as it seems
popular, and the stubs file uses classname.c)</p></li><li><p>Compile the .c files using the
<b  >-fPIC</b> (position independent) flag:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -c -fPIC -I/usr/local/java/include
filename.c
</pre></li><li><p>Generate the shared lib (these flags are for gcc
2.7.0):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -shared -Wl,-soname,libFOO.so.1 -o
libFOO.so.1.0 *.o -lotherlib
</pre></li><li><p>Put the .so file somewhere in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
(or add it to /etc/ld.so.conf).</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb81580.0xc7a528"></a>An Example: The PGConnection Class</h2></div></div><p>The PGConnection class is a wrapper for libpq's PGconn. A
PGconn represents a connection to the backend Postgres95 process,
and all operations on the database go through that connection. Each
PGConnection will create a PGconn and keep a pointer to it for
future use.</p><p>Let's walk through the steps above:</p><p>First, we write our PGConnection.java file
(<a href="5535l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>). Remember that it must
compile cleanly in order to generate our header and stubs, so if
you refer to any Java methods that you haven't written, create
dummy methods for them. We will need a constructor, a finalizer,
and all of the operations that libpq allows on a PGconn. We declare
most of these operations as native methods (see
<a href="5535l1.html" target="_self">Listing
1</a>&mdash;<b  >exec()</b> and
<b  >getline()</b> are special cases that we'll consider
later).</p><p><a href="5535l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.
PGConnection.java</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb81580.0xc7a8f0"></a>The PGConnection Constructor</h2></div></div><p>To get a PGconn, libpq provides the function:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PGConn *setDB(char *host, char *port, char *options, char *tty,
char *dbName)
</pre><p>Since this in effect &ldquo;constructs&rdquo; the connection to the
database, we'll use this as a model for our constructor (See
<a href="5535l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>, line 18). The
constructor simply calls <b  >connectDB()</b>
(<a href="5535l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>, line 21; a native
method that calls <b  >setdb()</b>&mdash;we'll define it in a
moment), and throws an exception if the connection is not made.
Doing the error checking in the constructor guarantees that no
connection will be returned if the call to <b  >setdb
()</b> fails.</p><p>Now let's look at our first native method,
<b  >connectDB()</b>. We declare it as native at line 70
in <a href="5535l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>. Note that no Java
code is provided.</p><p>There are several important things to notice about this
declaration. The &ldquo;private&rdquo; keyword makes this method accessible
only from the PGConnection class itself (we want only our
constructor calling it). The &ldquo;native&rdquo; keyword tells Java that
code from a shared library should be loaded for this method at
runtime. Since libpq is not &ldquo;thread-save&rdquo;, we want to make it
impossible for two threads to be making calls to libpq at the same
time. Making all of our native methods &ldquo;synchronized&rdquo; goes a long
way towards this goal (we will return to this when we tackle the
asynchronous notification system). Finally
(<a href="5535l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>, lines 70-73), the
declaration states that <b  >connectDB()</b> takes five
Java strings as arguments and doesn't return anything.</p><p><a href="5535f1.html" target="_self">Figure 1. How Types Convert to and
from Java and C</a></p><p>The remainder of the native calls follow this same pattern,
with the exception of <b  >exec()</b> and
<b  >getline()</b>. Again, we'll put these off a little
longer.</p><p>Before we continue, let's add the loadLibrary call. We place
it at the end of the class, in a block marked &ldquo;static&rdquo; (Listing
1, line 92) with no method name. Any blocks such as this are
executed when the class is loaded (exactly once) and libraries that
have already been loaded will not be duplicated. In our example,
we'll name the library libJgres.so.1.0, so we need to use
loadLibrary (&ldquo;Jgres&rdquo;) (See <a href="5535l1.html" target="_self">Listing
1</a>, line 94).</p><p>With our .java file complete, we are ready to write the C
code. First, we compile the .java file with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
javac PGConnection.java
</pre><p>Then, we create the &ldquo;stubs&rdquo; file and the .h file
with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
javah PGConnection
javah -stubs PGConnection
</pre><p>At this point you should have PGConnection.h and
PGConnection.c in your current directory. PGConnection.c is the
&ldquo;stubs&rdquo; file, and should not be modified. For our purposes, the
only thing you must do to the stubs file is to compile it and link
it into your shared library.</p><p>PGConnection.h is a header file that must be included in any
C file that accesses PGConnection objects. At line 14 (see
<a href="5535l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>) you will find the
declaration of a struct corresponding to the data for our object.
Below that you will find prototypes for all of the native methods
we declared. When writing the C code for native methods, you must
match these signatures exactly. <a href="5535l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2.
PGConnectionNative.c (includes PGConnection.h)</a></p><p>Now, let's (finally) write the C code.</p><p>The code for <b  >connectDB</b> is very
straightforward, and demonstrates the majority of the issues
involved in writing native code. Notice that the first argument to
<b  >connectDB</b> is not listed in the PGConnection.java
file. Java automatically passes a &ldquo;handle&rdquo; (a fancy pointer) to
the object you are dealing with as the first parameter of every
native method. In our case, this is a pointer to a struct
HPGConnection (defined in PGConnection.h), which we name &ldquo;this&rdquo;
(<a href="5535l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>, line 14. If you're
working in C++, you may want to use &ldquo;self&rdquo; since &ldquo;this&rdquo; is a
keyword). Any access to the object's data must go through this
handle.</p><p>The remainder of the parameters are the Strings we passed in
(see PGConnection.java). These are also passed as handles, or
pointers to the struct Hjava_lang_String (defined in
java_lang_string.h, included by native.h). We could access these
structures like any other handles (see below), but Java provides
several convenient functions that make it much easier to work with
strings.</p><p>The most useful of these functions are
<b  >makeCString</b> and
<b  >makeJavaString</b>. These convert Java's Strings to
char *s and vice versa, which use Java's garbage collector to
handle memory allocation and recovery automatically. (</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb81580.0x1073900"></a>Beware of a major pitfall here!</h2></div></div><p>You must store the value returned by
<b  >makeCStrin</b>g in a variable. If you pass the
return value directly to a function, the garbage collector may free
it at any time. The same is not true of
<b  >makeJavaString</b>.) Lines 30-34 in
<a href="5535l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a> show the use of
<b  >makeCString</b> and we use
<b  >makeJavaString</b> first at line 51. Lines 41-42 in
<a href="5535l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a> show our call into the
libpq library. It is called exactly as normal, and the resulting
pointer is stored in the variable tmpConn. You may notice that we
don't do any error-checking here: we do that in the Java code for
our constructor, where it is easier to throw exceptions.
</p><p>As I mentioned above, <b  >PGConnection</b> needs
to keep the <b  >PGconn</b> pointer around, so that it
can use it in later calls&mdash;all later calls, in fact.
In order to do this, we will store the
32 bit pointer in a data member with Java type <span   class="bold"><b>int</b></span>
after casting it to a C long to avoid warnings (see Table 1
for a list of type conversions).
</p><p>To access this member, we must use Java's &ldquo;handles&rdquo;.
Handles are used to access data in a Java object. When you want to
access a data member, you simply use
<b  >unhand(ptr)-&gt;member</b> rather than
<b  >ptr-&gt;member</b> (where ptr is the handle). We do
this on line 42 of PGConnectionNative.c
(<a href="5535l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>) to save the pointer
returned by setDB in a Java int (note: if you forget the unhand()
macro, you will get a warning about incompatible pointer
types).</p><p>This function has covered almost all you need to know to call
C functions from Java (calling Java methods from C is possible, but
the interface is clumsy at best at this point, and where possible,
I'd avoid it). Most of the rest of the methods (host, options,
port, etc.) simply convert the data and make the C call. We'll just
take a look at one of these,
<b  >PGConnection.db()</b>.</p><p>The only significant portion of the C function
<b  >PGConnection_db()</b> is its first line (Listing 2,
line 46). It needs a <b  >PGconn</b> to pass to
<b  >PQdb()</b>, so it must get it out of the
<b  >PGConnection</b> member,
<b  >PGconnRep</b>. It uses
<b  >cw[unhand()</b> to get the pointer as a long, then
casts that to a <b  >(PGconn *)</b>. Since this line is
so messy (and is starting to look like lisp!) I created a macro,
<b  >thisPGconn</b>, to clean up the code a little. It is
used in the remainder of the file, and its definition is at the top
of the file (don't put it in PGConnection.h, since that is
machine-generated).</p><p>All of the native methods in the Java class PGResult follow
the same basic structure, and there is no reason to go over
them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb81580.0x10742f8"></a>Jumping through Some Hoops</h2></div></div><p>There are some places where Java and C just don't get along.
The rest of this section will touch on the few I found, and how I
avoided them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb81580.0x1074400"></a>Hoop #1: Returning Java Objects
<b  >(exec()</b> Explained)</h2></div></div><p>The <b  >exec()</b> method (see, I told you I'd get
to it) needs to return a PGResult object. This is in keeping with
libpq's structure, and the OO nature of Java. However, returning an
object from a native method can get pretty hairy. The &ldquo;official&rdquo;
way to do it is to call the function:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
HObject *execute_java_constructor(ExecEnv *,
                                 char *classname,
                                 ClassClass *cb,
                                 char *signature, ...);
</pre><p>and return the HObject * it returns. Personally, I find this
interface extremely clumsy, and have managed to avoid it. However,
for completeness, the actual call in our case would be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
return execute_java_constructor(EE(), "classPGResult",
                                0, "(I)LclassPGResult;",
(long)tmpResult);
</pre><p>I found it far easier to create a buffer between the call to
<b  >exec()</b> and the call to
<b  >PQexec()</b> that could call the constructor from
Java. This is where the <b  >nativeExec()</b> method
comes from. <b  >exec()</b> simply passes the string to
<b  >nativeExec()</b>, which returns an int (the PGresult
pointer that <b  >PQexec()</b> returned). Then it calls
PGResult's constructor with that int.</p><p>The extra layer will also come in handy when we add the
asynchronous notification system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb81580.0x1074980"></a>Hoop #2: Append to Strings in Java, not C
<b  >(getline()</b> Explained)</h2></div></div><p><b  >PQgetline()</b> expects the user to
continually call it while it fills in a static buffer. This is
simply not needed in Java. A much nicer interface is to just have
<b  >getline()</b> return a String. However, building the
String (appending each return value from
<b  >PQgetline()</b>) required calling Java methods from
C&mdash;which, as we saw in Hoop #1, is very messy. By using a
StringBuffer (a String that can grow) and doing the work in the
Java code, it's much easier to understand, if a little
slower.</p><p>The flip side of this is that the return value is now the
String, so there must be another way to tell if an error has
occurred or an EOF has been reached. One solution (I'm looking for
a better one), and the one we use, is to set a data member flag. If
the flag has been set to EOF, we simply return a Java null String.
So once again, an extra layer saves us from a lot of truly gross
code!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb81580.0x1074c40"></a>Hoop #3: You Can't Get a Stream's FILE*;
<b  >(trace()</b> and <b  >formatTuples()</b>
Explained)</h2></div></div><p>This is one hoop I think the JavaSoft team should've solved
for us. There is simply no way to get a FILE * (or a file
descriptor) from a FileStream. <b  >PQtrace()</b> expects
a FILE *, so we simply open one, based on a filename passed in by
the user. We check to see if it's &ldquo;stdout&rdquo; or &ldquo;stderr&rdquo;, and act
accordingly.</p><p>We see the problem again when we try to implement
Postgres95's <b  >printTuples</b> (or
<b  >displayTuples</b> for 1.1). It also expects a FILE*,
but this time the solution is a little messier. Here, we want the
output in a String, so we open a temporary file, send it to the
libpq function, rewind it, read it, and close it. This is pretty
messy, but it does work, and is actually pretty quick about it. If
we wanted to write a cleaner version, we could certainly rewrite
<b  >displayTuples()</b> completely in Java code, using
PGResult's native methods <b  >fname()</b> and
<b  >getValue()</b> that we have already defined.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb81580.0x1075060"></a>The Finish Line</h2></div></div><p>:

here, because if we get a PostgresException on an
<b  >exec()</b>, we want to simply print the error and
continue (we handle the exception on lines 43-46). If we reach line
34, we know that the PGResult is valid. We check to see if it
returned any tuples, and use <b  >formatTuples()</b> to
print them if it did. If not, we simply print the current status
and continue.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb81580.0xf87638"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>In this segment, we've shown how to create simple Java
