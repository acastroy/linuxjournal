    Are you an absolute beginner? Here's a brief
    introduction to using the JDK.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a71580.0x1b695b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Java has taken the Internet and
programming communities by storm during the past year with its
promise to enable the creation of software that can run on any
platform from a single binary file and be used securely in a
distributed network environment.
</p><p>The Java concept is simple: a single source code file is
compiled to a single pseudo-binary file containing Java byte codes.
This binary file can be run on any platform for which a Java
interpreter or other runtime engine exists.</p><p>In order to develop and test these Java applications, it is
necessary to have access to several critical development tools,
including a compiler, a debugger and a Java interpreter for testing
applications. Numerous Java development environments already
exist&mdash;primarily for MS-Windows systems. These full professional
development tools are produced by the likes of Borland and
Symantec. For Linux, and Unix in general, this type of commercial
development tool hasn't become available.</p><p>Nonetheless, this doesn't mean that Linux users are unable to
develop Java applets and applications. Sun Microsystems has
developed a free Java Developer's Kit (JDK) which includes a
compiler, a debugger, a runtime environment and an applet viewer
for testing Java applets embedded in web pages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a71580.0x1b697c0"></a>Obtaining the JDK</h2></div></div><p>The Java Developer's Kit was originally developed by Sun for
SPARC, Solaris and Windows NT/95. These versions of the kit, along
with more recent versions for x86 Solaris and MacOS, are available
from the JavaSoft web site at
<a href="http://www.javasoft.com" target="_self">http://www.javasoft.com/</a></p><p>Sun has also allowed other organizations to port the JDK to
other platforms. The Blackdown Organization (Randy Chapman) has
ported version 1.0.1 of the JDK to Linux and makes binaries
available for x86 versions of Linux. The JDK distribution for Linux
is available from ftp://ftp.blackdown.org/pub/Java/linux/.
Blackdown also has a web page at
<a href="http://www.blackdown.org/" target="_self">www.blackdown.org/</a>.
On the web site you will find three files:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
linux.jdk-1.0.1-try3.common.tar.gz
linux.jdk-1.0.1-try3.static-motif-bin.tar.gz
linux.jdk-1.0.1-try3.shared-motif-bin.tar.gz
</pre><p>It is necessary to download two of these three files:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
linux.jdk-1.0.1-try3.common.tar.gz
</pre><p>plus either:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
linux.jdk-1.0.1-try3.static-motif-bin.tar.gz
</pre><p>or:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
linux.jdk-1.0.1-try3.shared-motif-bin.tar.gz
</pre><p>The last file requires an ELF binary of version 2.0 of the
Motif libraries (libXm.so.2). If you don't have Motif, download
linux.jdk-1.0.1-try3.static-motif-bin.tar.gz instead&mdash;it is a
larger file but will work regardless of whether you have the Motif
libraries or not. Throughout this article we will be using
linux.jdk-1.0.1-try3.static-motif-bin.tar.gz.</p><p>All versions of the Java Developer's Kit also require the
following libraries, many of which may already be on your
system:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>/lib/libc.so.5.2.16</p></li><li><p>/usr/X11/lib/libX11.so.6.0</p></li><li><p>/usr/X11/lib/libXt.so.6.0</p></li><li><p>/usr/X11/lib/libXext.so.6.0</p></li><li><p>/usr/X11/lib/libXpm.so.4.3</p></li><li><p>/lib/libdl.so.1.7.9</p></li></ul></div><p>If you are missing any of these libraries, the JDK will not
work. These libraries are all freely available on the
Internet.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a71580.0x1b6a1b8"></a>Installing the JDK</h2></div></div><p>Once the &ldquo;common&rdquo; tar file and one of the Motif tars have
been downloaded, they need to be uncompressed. The documentation
with the Linux JDK recommends installing the JDK in the /usr/local
directory (although it can be installed elsewhere). To do this,
copy the two compressed tar files to /usr/local with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cp linux.jdk-1.0.1-try3.common.tar.gz /usr/local
cp
linux.jdk-1.0.1-try3.static-motif-bin.taR.GZ
/usr/local
</pre><p>Then, the files can be uncompressed and untarred with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar xzvf linux.jdk-1.0.1-try3.common.tar.gz
linux.jdk-1.0.1-try3.static-motif-bin.tar.gz
</pre><p>This will create a directory java/ under /usr/local which
contains four subdirectories: bin, demo, include and lib.
/usr/local/java will also contain a zip file with the source and
various README and HOWTO files. The bin/ directory contains the
scripts used to execute all the components of the JDK. The
components are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>appletviewer</b></span>: A
viewer to test applets embedded in HTML documents.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>javac</b></span>: The Java
compiler: compiles Java source code to Java byte code binary files
(known as class files). The class files produced by javac can be
run by a Java interpreter on any platform.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>java</b></span>: The Java
interpreter: used to execute Java class files under Linux.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>jdb</b></span>: The Java
Debugger: a command-line debugger which is in alpha
development.</p></li></ul></div><p>Each of these scripts in java/bin actually call executable
files in java/bin/i586. These scripts expect certain tools to exist
in fixed locations in your system. Specifically, the appletviewer
script expects mkdir to be in /usr/bin and pwd to be in /bin. On
some systems, this may not be true (for instance, in RedHat-derived
systems, you may find mkdir in /bin). There are two solutions to
this problem. One is to edit java/bin/appletviewer and replace the
incorrect occurrences of /usr/bin/mkdir or /bin/pwd with the
correct full paths of these programs.</p><p>The second solution is to create symbolic links in the
directories expected by appletviewer. For instance, on RedHat
systems where mkdir is in /bin, a symbolic link could be created in
/usr/bin with the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ln -s /bin/mkdir /usr/bin/mkdir
</pre><p>If you expect to be using the JDK components frequently, you
will probably want to add the java/bin directory to your path.
Assuming you installed the JDK under /usr/local and you are running
the bash shell (the default shell for many Linux distributions),
you could add the following lines to the .bashrc file in your home
directory:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PATH=/usr/local/java/bin:$PATH
export PATH
</pre><p>If you are running C shell, the following line at the end of
your .cshrc file in your home directory will do the job:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
setenv PATH /usr/local/java/bin:$PATH
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a71580.0x1b6ab00"></a>Using the JDK</h2></div></div><p>Although the details of programming and developing Java
applications and applets are beyond the scope of this article, we
will briefly cover how to go about compiling and running Java
applications and applets. Java source code is saved in files with
the .java extension. Once compiled, a class file (with a .class
extension) will be created. Assuming the java/bin directory is in
your path as outlined above, a Java source file can be compiled
with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
javac filename.java
</pre><p>Class files for applications can be executed using:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
java filename.class
</pre><p>Applets are a little more complicated. Applets are run as
embedded pieces of web pages and are included in web pages with a
special &lt;APPLET&gt; tag. You can test an embedded applet with
appletviewer or Netscape Navigator 2.0 or 3.0. With Navigator,
simply choose Open from the File menu and then open the HTML file
with the embedded applet.</p><p>With appletviewer, simply type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        appletviewer filename.html
</pre><p>Running applets as well as some Java applications requires
that you are working in an X-Windows environment. If you don't have
X-Windows installed on your system you won't be able to test
applets or any applications which make use of Java's GUI
development capabilities.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a71580.0x1f630c0"></a>Troubleshooting Your Installation</h2></div></div><p>On most Linux systems the steps outlined above should be all
that is required to get the JDK up and running. However, on some
systems you may experience some difficulty; some of the common
errors and their solutions are outlined below:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>You get an error message referring to /dev/zero.
The device /dev/zero needs to have world read and write
permissions. Set these permissions using:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        chmod 666 /dev/zero
</pre></li><li><p>You get &ldquo;dirname: too many arguments&rdquo; or &ldquo;cannot
find class&rdquo; errors. The component you are trying to run cannot
find the native Java class files. The JDK uses the environment
variable CLASSPATH to find these files. This variable is set in
java/bin/.java_wrapper and java/bin/appletviewer. However, with
your shell, these scripts are having trouble determining the
correct directory. You can edit these files so that the CLASSPATH
gets set correctly.</p></li></ul></div><p>In .java_wrapper, change the line which reads:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        J_HOME=`dirname $PRG`/..
</pre><p>to</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        J_HOME=/usr/local/java
</pre><p>(or wherever you installed the JDK) A similar change needs to
be made in appletviewer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a71580.0x1f63590"></a>Getting More Information</h2></div></div><p>Once you have installed the Java Developer's Kit, you will
probably want more information about developing Java applications
and applets. Aside from Sun's official Java home page at
<a href="http://www.javasoft.com" target="_self">http://www.javasoft.com/</a>,
the Gamelan directory
(<a href="http://www.gamelan.com" target="_self">http://www.gamelan.com/</a>)
provides an extensive collection of applets and applications&mdash;many
with source code&mdash;as well as pointers to other reference material.
The comp.lang.java newsgroup is a high-volume newsgroup which is
actively used by many Java experts and novice programmers.</p></div></div>
