    Macintosh users can now come in from the cold&mdash;MkLinux has
    arrived. Here's how it happened, and how you can get it.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22c8580.0x23c0608"></a></h2></div></div><p>May 17, 1996 was a day of celebration
among people who are both Macintosh and Linux devotees, for it is
the day Apple and the Open Software Foundation let loose the first
Developer's Release of the anxiously awaited MkLinux. MkLinux is a
PowerPC-native version of Linux that operates on top of a MACH
kernel. Back in February, Apple and the Open Software Foundation
announced they would work together to port Linux to the
PowerMacintosh platform. Since then, the progress of the teams
working in Grenoble, France and in Cupertino, California has been
anxiously followed.
</p><p>Keeping up with the project was made easier with the creation
of mailing lists and a web site run by Nick Stephen, one of the
project's programmers laboring in Grenoble. While obviously very
busy, Nick kept an impatient community at bay with progress reports
and patient answers to both simple and complex questions.</p><p>While being harassed on an almost weekly basis to &ldquo;release
the code so we can begin hacking on it&rdquo;, the OSF and Apple teams
were adamant that nothing would be released until it was at least
marginally stable&mdash;the growing MkLinux community would have to
wait.</p><p>On May 17, that wait ended as MkLinux DR1 was released, both
on CD-ROM to the attendees at Apple's World Wide Developer's
Conference and to the world at large via the Internet. Proving they
were on top of what was to become a small whirlwind of discussions
and reports, Apple switched the old OSF mailing list to one of
their servers and created a bevy of additional mailing lists
devoted to specific topics. Apple also hosted the project's main
web site, http://www.mklinux.apple.com
(<a href="0141f1.html" target="_self">Figure 1</a>), and one of several FTP
sites where the MkLinux DR1 release could be downloaded onto
waiting hard drives. For a developmental release, it was a
professional roll-out. Now the question on everyone's mind&mdash;&ldquo;Was
the wait worth it?&rdquo;&mdash;could be answered.</p><p><a href="0141f1.html" target="_self">Figure 1. MkLinux World Wide Web
Site</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22c8580.0x23c0920"></a>The Price of Admission</h2></div></div><p>The admission price, in terms of computing resources needed
for the first MkLinux Developmental Release, is somewhat steep.
This is not a Linux you are going to be able to cram into 2MB of
RAM and a 40MB hard drive. Apple recommends that those brave
persons who try installing DR1 have at least 16MB of RAM and 400MB
free on their hard drives. Also, according to Apple, an entire hard
drive should be devoted to your MkLinux partitions, if possible.
Your choice of platforms is also somewhat limited. At this time,
MkLinux runs only on NuBus PowerMacintoshes using the PPC 601 RISC
chip. The 603 or 604 chips are not supported, nor is the PCI bus.
That situation will soon change.</p><p>The packages that have to be procured for the installation
are also huge. Apple originally put them on the Internet at
ftp://mklinux.apple.com/pub/MkLinux_DR1 for transfer and within a
week, other sites had them available for download. Packaged as
stuffed MacOS SIT files, the initial MkLinux distribution file,
MkLinux_DR1.sit, is 42MB in size. Uncompressed, this expands to
over 120MB! Additional packages, all several megabytes in size, are
also available for the MACH source code, the Red Hat Package
Management (rpm) source packages, the rpm binaries, and the X11
distribution. All in all, while you only <span   class="emphasis"><em>need</em></span>
the 42MB MkLinux_DR1.sit file to get started, the full distribution
weighs in at nearly 200MB of material.</p><p>Realizing that this could prove to be a severe problem to
many of the people who want this initial distribution, Apple made a
deal with Prime Time Freeware (http://www.ptf.com) to release to
the general public the same CD-ROM given out to the attendees of
Apple's World Wide Developer's Conference. By sending $10 plus
shipping and handling to Prime Time Freeware, you'd be saved the
time and aggravation of having to download several megabytes from
an increasingly fickle Internet. Given the weight of the
distribution, many people opted for the CD-ROM in getting this
first version of MkLinux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22c8580.0x23c0b30"></a>Of Partitions and Installations</h2></div></div><p>Once you have the required packages, either after downloading
them from the Internet or getting them off the CD-ROM, what
happens? The first job is to format and partition your drive. The
Apple/OSF team wrote MkLinux to use the same type of partitions as
Apple's A/UX product in order to make it (theoretically) easy to
partition your drives, since most Mac partitioning software
supports creating A/UX partitions. As with any developmental
release, for some of us this worked, and for some of us it didn't.
As an example of the support the community gave not only itself but
the MkLinux team, Philip Machanick of the University of the
Witwatersrand in South Africa kept track of those types of hard
drives and partitioning programs people reported were working and
not working with the DR1 release. By the time you read this, the
need for keeping such a list should be long past. Apple recommends
that you partition at least a 300MB root partition. This can be
divided into a 100MB root partition and a 200MB /usr partition, if
you want to. You must also have a swap partition that is at least
32MB in size, but not larger than 64MB. Because of how Uhix type
&ldquo;upgrades&rdquo; are done, it is best to separate the root and /usr
partitions.</p><p>Once the drive partitioning is completed&mdash;a job that Apple's
release notes call the most difficult process of the
installation&mdash;you run the &ldquo;Install MkLinux&rdquo; application to begin
the actual file copying process. When this Macintosh application
runs, it asks several questions. Most importantly, the installer
needs to know the SCSI drive number of the hard drive with the
MkLinux partitions. Once that is secured, it goes on to find each
of the partitions you've created and asks if you wish to use them.
The application is so careful in making sure you want to do what
you say that some users felt they were put through an electronic
version of the Inquisition during installation. However, once all
the questions are answered to the satisfaction of the installer, it
copies the needed files to the newly created MkLinux partitions. It
also modifies the Macintosh System Folder by adding one Control
Panel and two System Extensions. Together, these files act as the
Macintosh version of LILO, enabling you to specify which OS will
boot up on system startup. The entire installation, once started,
takes about fifteen minutes to complete.</p><p>Once the files are copied, you need to invoke the new MkLinux
Control Panel to tell the Macintosh which OS you'd like to use for
booting. At present, the options for the Mac LILO program are
rather limited. When you bring the Control Panel up, you have a
choice of selecting one of two radio buttons: MacOS or MkLinux
(Figure 2). Once you make this selection, there is a button
available to enable rebooting right then and there.</p><p><a href="0141f2.html" target="_self">Figure 2. MkLinux Control
Panel</a></p><p>Depending on which radio button you choose in the MkLinux
Control Panel, a couple of different things can happen. If you
choose to reboot MacOS, you won't even know MkLinux is available to
you (save for the space its partitions consume on your hard drive).
If, however, you're brave and elect to boot MkLinux, very early in
the Macintosh boot process, the MkLinux LILO screen appears on the
screen. This colorful and well-constructed dialog box
(<a href="0141f3.html" target="_self">Figure 3</a>) gives you the choice of
booting MkLinux or booting MacOS. The countdown in the lower
right-hand corner of the dialog box gives you ten seconds to make
up your mind before, by default, the machine boots MkLinux.</p><p><a href="0141f3.html" target="_self">Figure 3. MkLinux Dialog
Box</a></p><p>Assuming you boot MkLinux, your screen turns black, and the
white-lettered lines of a Linux system booting up scroll up your
screen. After a short pause, the screen will again clear and
print:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
MkLinux for Power Macintosh. Brought to you by Apple Computer, Inc.
Kernel 1.2.13 on a osfmach3_ppc
login:
</pre><p>Congratulations! You're now running native Linux on a
PowerMacintosh!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22c8580.0x23c1000"></a>Your Mileage May Vary</h2></div></div><p>Despite being distributed by Prime Time Freeware, MkLinux is
not yet ready for prime time. As already noted, many people have
had problems right from the start, being unable to even boot from
their drives. Sources at Apple say this problem will be solved by
the time you read this article, but if you're considering
purchasing a new drive, you will want to check whether the one
you're considering has been used successfully by someone else
before spending money on it.</p><p>Video support in the first Developer's Release is a bit
sparse. Only on-board video and the HPV card are supported, and
this has caused some problems with people who have &ldquo;AV&rdquo; Macintosh
systems.</p><p>Floppy drives and, more unfortunately, serial output, are not
supported with this first release. Thus, while you can play around
with networking if you have access to Ethernet, those of us who
connect to the Internet via PPP will have to wait a bit. The lack
of serial support also limits printing options.</p><p>On the SCSI bus, only hard drives and CD-ROMs are supported
at the moment. The release notes say other devices, such as the
Iomega ZIP drive, have not been tested, but I have not gotten mine
to work, and I know of no one on the Internet who has.</p><p>Finally, as with any developer's release, your mileage may
vary with respect to getting various programs and systems working.
For example, while I have not gotten Emacs to work, I know of
several people who've had no problem with it. On the other hand,
Apple's own Errata, as of May 25, mentions a problem regarding a
shell script that will cause you to be logged out the first time
you log on as root; I have never encountered this problem.</p><p>However, the MkLinux teams at Apple and OSF got a lot of
things right. The installation procedure (assuming you have a
MkLinux-friendly drive) is one of the smoothest installations I've
ever been through for a software package of this size. Considering
this is a developer's release, it has been remarkably stable. While
there have been some surprises, usually either some work-around has
been developed or the situation is put right on the &ldquo;to-do&rdquo; list
by the Apple/OSF teams.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22c8580.0x23c12c0"></a>MkLinux's Future Shines Bright</h2></div></div><p>According to Michael Burg at Apple, MkLinux will go through
at least one more developer's release, scheduled near the end of
the summer, before the Reference Release is distributed in
September. The MkLinux world has proven that it moves as quickly as
the Intel Linux world, with updates and patches appearing on
Apple's FTP site ftp://ftp.mklinux.apple.com/pub/) on a weekly
basis. According to a schedule that Michael Burg released to the
Internet in early June, most of the bugs and omissions from
DR1&mdash;such as video console and driver issues, SCSI driver bugs, and
the lack of serial support&mdash;should be solved and implemented by
the time you read this article. PCI bus support is scheduled for
the Reference Release with support for the PPC 603e platforms
coming some time in autumn.</p><p><a href="0141s1.html" target="_self">Sidebar: Prime Time

MKLinux FAQ</a></p><p>After autumn, what's next? To a large extent, like any Linux,
that depends on us. Apple and the OSF have released the full source
code for this project to anyone who wants it, respecting the spirit
that has guided Linux since Linus Torvalds first released it. Some
Intel Linux hackers have wondered whether there is enough of a
critical mass of MkLinux programmers to keep the project alive.
Based on the beginnings of the community that has come alive around
this first developer's release, I don't think we'll disappoint our
Intel brethren.</p><p><a href="0141s3.html" target="_self">Sidebar: As We Go To
