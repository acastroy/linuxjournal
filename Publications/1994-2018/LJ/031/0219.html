Installation</h2></div></div><p>I have a new scsi controller (aha2940) which my only hard
drive is connected to. I can get the latest boot disk for my
controller, but the kernel that gets installed by Slackware is
unbootable. How do I use the kernel on my boot disk as a kernel for
my hard drive? How can I boot from the floppy and compile a kernel
for my hard drive?</p><p>Manni Wood</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f65580.0x205d450"></a>A Work-around</h2></div></div><p>During the Slackware installation procedure, a kernel is
installed from the distribution set instead of from the boot disk
that you used to start your i system. Handling the installation
this way has the unfortunate side effect of making certain hardware
devices unrecognizable to your new system since only two kernels
are included in the distribution set&mdash;one for IDE and another for
SCSI-based systems. The installation is handled this way because
the boot disk kernels are &ldquo;all-in-one&rdquo; packages that have device
drivers for every imaginable piece of hardware. This is quite
inefficient for normal use, since many of the drivers are unused
and these extra options will waste memory. After you install Linux
you should compile and install a new kernel image with only the
options you really need.</p><p>While you are setting up your system, you can use a temporary
work-around that will let you use the boot disk's kernel to boot
your system. Slackware boot disks prompt you for a set of options
to pass to the booted kernel. One of the options will allow you to
boot a system that has no working kernel image installed. At the
prompt, type <b  >mount root=/dev/X</b> , where X
specifies the drive and partition where you installed Linux, e.g.
sda, hdb2. This boot disk can be quite handy to have in case you
forget to re-run LILO after installing a new kernel, because your
system will be unbootable without it. When it is used in
conjunction with a root diskette that also contains some diagnosis
and recovery tools, you will have a powerful pair of emergency
utility disks.</p><p>Once Linux is running you need to copy a working boot kernel
to wherever LILO (assuming you installed LILO) is looking for your
current image. As a general practice you'll want to keep a backup
copy installed as well. You can control LILO by editing
<b  >/etc/lilo.conf</b>. The default file should be
fairly well commented and you can consult the LILO documentation
for more details. If you don't have the original file you can copy
the boot diskette onto your drive as a kernel image with the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dd if=/dev/fd0 of=/tmp/myimage bs=8192
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>replacing <b>if</b> and
<b>of</b> with the appropriate input and output
locations. After the new kernel file is in place, rerun LILO by
typing <b>lilo</b> so it can rebuild its boot tables.
If you forget to take this step you will not be able to boot your
system! To recompile and install a new kernel, obtain a kernel and
extract the archive into <b>/usr/src/linux</b>. Users
with Slackware distributions set up for kernel version 1.2 need to
beware. Many things have changed as Linux has grown to version 2.0,
so many things can break. You may wish to make this step later.
Slackware 3.0 comes with the complete set of the newest version 1.2
kernel package, in the K disk set. Either install that or unpack
your desired package into
<b>/usr/src/linux</b>.</em></span>
</p><p>The easiest and safest (though not the nicest looking) way to
rebuild the kernel is to then <b  >cd</b> into
<b  >/usr/src/linux</b>, type <b  >make
config,</b> and answer all the questions. Then type
<b  >make dep; make clean; make zImage</b>. If you are
running on an Intel platform your new kernel image will be produced
in <b  >/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/zImage</b> . Be
prepared to wait, especially if you have a slow machine. If you are
using a newer kernel package, you might type <b  >make
menuconfig</b> or one of the other combinations (see Makefile
for details) for a better-looking configuration process.</p><p>&mdash;Chad RobinsonBRT Technical Services

obtain a news feed from somewhere. Your ISP should be able to point
you in the right direction, or sell you one themselves. Note that
you don't necessarily need a news feed to use INN or CNews. If you
only want to support some some local news groups, within a company
intranet for example, then you don't need an outside feed. Looked
at in that light, a Linux PC and INN can provide one of the
most-touted features of a product like Lotus Notes (group
conferencing and company-wide discussion forums) at a fraction of
the cost. Once you've made arrangements for a feed, then you need
to install the software. I recommend INN for new sites. You have a
Red Hat distribution, and Red Hat has an RPM (Red Hat Packaging
System) for INN on their ftp site under
ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/contrib/RPMS/inn-1.4unoff4-2.i386.rpm.
Download, then install with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -i inn-1.4unoff4-2.i386.rpm
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>It works right &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo;. You will, of
course, have to configure it for your site&mdash;add your feed site to
<b>/etc/news/newsfeeds, nntpsend.ctl</b> and
<b>hosts.nntp</b>. Verify that the groups you want to
carry are in <b>/var/lib/news/active</b> and
newsgroups, and then configure <b>nnrp.access</b> to
allow reading/posting from the proper IP addresses.</em></span>
</p><p>After that is all working add
<b  >/usr/lib/news/bin/news.daily</b> and nntpsend to
<b  >/etc/crontab</b>. News.daily and nntpsend should be
run as user &ldquo;news&rdquo;, not as root. These programs expire old news
and transmit your site's outgoing posts, respectively.</p><p>The RPM installs a FAQ under /usr/doc that should answer most
of your questions.</p><p>&mdash;Bob Hauck, Wasatch Communications
