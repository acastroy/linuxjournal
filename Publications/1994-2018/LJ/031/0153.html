    Have you gotten used to hypertext? Want the same mobility in your
    source code and other documentation? etags may be your answer.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16f7580.0x17ef450"></a></h2></div></div><p>You've probably used hypertext links to
browse the Web, skipping easily between pages with simple
keystrokes or mouse clicks. With etags you can browse your source
programs and documentation just as easily. In this article I'll
describe tag files and the etags and
<span   class="bold"><b>ctags</b></span> commands that generate them.
I'll also look at how <span   class="bold"><b>less</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>Emacs</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> use tag files to make your
editing easier and more productive.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16f7580.0x17ef6b8"></a>etags and Emacs</h2></div></div><p>By default, etags takes a collection of source files and
generates an index of the definitions of all the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>global</em></span> symbols of interest. For C and C++
programs, this index includes global and member functions, classes,
structures, enums, typedefs and <b  >#define</b>s. For
(La)TeX documents, it indexes chapters, sections, subsections,
figures, equations etc. etags also includes built-in support for
assembler, Fortran, lex, Lisp, Pascal, Sheme and yac.
<b  >etags --help</b> will give a complete list of
languages supported by your version.</p><p>Try running <b  >etags *.c *.h</b> in one of your
source directories. After it finishes processing, you'll find that
it has produced a file called <b  >TAGS</b>. This is a
simple text file, with a block of entries for each file parsed.
Each block contains a line for each definition in the file, with
the text of the definition and the line number and absolute
character position on which it was found.</p><p>How do you use this? Well, the simplest way is from within
Emacs. You start editing as normal in the source directory. When
you come across a call to one of your functions, and want to see
how it was defined, position the cursor on the call, and enter the
Emacs command <b  >M-.</b> (press the
<b  >esc</b> key followed by a period, or hold
<b  >alt</b> and period down at the same time). Emacs
will display the name of the function in the mini-buffer. If you
press <b  >return</b> to confirm, Emacs will
automatically open the file containing the definition and position
the cursor at its start. Suppose while looking through that
function, you are puzzled by a declaration which uses a typedef
name. Move the cursor to it, press <b  >M-H.</b> again,
and up pops the typedef. If you can't find the a
<b  >#define</b> you created, use <b  >M-.</b>,
then type the macro name in the minibuffer. Emacs looks it up in
the tags table and takes you straight to it.</p><p>Sometimes you'll have more than one tag containing the same
text, and <b  >M-.</b> will take you to the wrong place.
Simply keep pressing <b  >C-u M-.</b>, and Emacs will
move through all possible tag matches. If you're finger-tied like
me, you may find <b  >M-0 M-.</b> a simpler way to enter
a prefix for the <b  >find-tag</b> command. Entering a
negative prefix (<b  >C-u -M.</b>) takes you back to a
previous definition.</p><p>That's not all you can do with the TAGS file. Imagine that
when you were typing in some source you decided to give your
functions long, descriptive names. It seemed like a good idea at
the time but now the glow is wearing off as you're typing a call to
that function for the nth time. Again, tags can help. Type the
first few characters of the name, then press
<b  >M-</b><b  >tab</b>. Either the full
function name will appear, or a window will pop up displaying a
list of possible completions. (This might not work for XEmacs
users, and you may have to re-bind <b  >M-tab</b> to
<b  >tag-complete-symbol</b>.)</p><p>You can also use tag completion in the minibuffer whenever a
command prompts for a tag&mdash;type in the first few characters,
press <b  >tab</b>, and Emacs will do the rest.</p><p>If you're an XEmacs user, the <b  >M-?</b>i command
displays a single line summary of a function or typedef in the
modeline&mdash;really useful if you've forgotten the calling
sequence!</p><p>Tags are also a great way to perform search and replace
operations across all your source files. The
<b  >tags-search</b> command prompts you for a regular
expression, then displays the first match in any of the files in
your TAGS table. You can move on to successive matches using
<b  >M-,</b> (that's <span   class="emphasis"><em>meta-comma</em></span>).
The <b  >tags-query-replace</b> performs a egex-replace
across all the files in the TAGS table. You can stop it at any
point (with <b  >escape</b> or <b  >C-g</b>)
and later resume it with <b  >M-,</b>.</p><p>Finally, the <b  >tags-apropos</b> lists in a
separate window all tags matching the regular expression that you
enter&mdash;a great way to scan for stuff in a hurry.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16f7580.0x17f0528"></a>ctags, vi and less</h2></div></div><p>In the same way that etags works with Emacs, the ctags
program generates tag files that can be used with vi,
<span   class="bold"><b>view</b></span> and less. The basic operation
of the command is the same, but it generates a file called
<b  >tags</b> (in lower case). Once it's finished, you
can go straight from the command line to a particular function in
either vi or less using <b  >vi
-t</b><span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span> or <b  >less
-t</b><span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span>. You don't even have to give
a file name!</p><p>If you're editing with vi, you can move to a tag using the
<b  >:tag</b> command.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16f7580.0x17f08f0"></a>Keeping up to Date</h2></div></div><p>Surprisingly, the <b  >TAGS</b> and
<b  >tags</b> index files remain valid even if you insert
and delete lines in the files they reference. You really need to
run etags/ctags only when you add or remove functions or files. I
find it convenient to have a <b  >tags:</b> target in my
Makefiles for this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tags:
       etags $(SRC)
</pre><p>If you have files in many directories, you
<span   class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> generate a single tags file covering
them all by specifying directory names on the command line. This
works fine in vi and Emacs, but you'll need to set up either the
<b  >tags-file-name</b> variable or
<b  >tag-table-alist</b> if you're an XEmacs user. I
personally find this pretty clumsy, and tend to stick to a TAGS
file per directory.</p><p><a href="0153.table.new.html" target="_self">More
Information</a></p><p><b  >man etags</b> and <b  >man ctags</b>
are the obvious starting places. You'll also find good information
in the Emacs info pages, and using the Emacs
<b  >?H-a</b> command.</p><p>ctags and etags are both included in Emacs and XEmacs
distributions. You can also get various other tags programs from
the Internet&mdash;<b  >archie -c ctags</b> will find a site
near you.</p></div></div>
