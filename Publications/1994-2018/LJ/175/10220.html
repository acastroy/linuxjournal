We've had democracy for a long time. Now we finally can make it work.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16de580.0x17d63b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
During the '04 campaign, Phil Windley&mdash;then CIO for the state of
Utah&mdash;said something profound about democracy, &ldquo;Most people
just want the roads fixed&rdquo;.
</p><p>
He went on to explain that there are two sides of democracy, and they aren't
defined by parties. One side is elections. The other side is governance.
Elections hog the spotlight, because they make good stories. Governance is
how the work gets done. To Phil, governance is the real frontier, the side
of democracy that has not met its promise.
</p><p>
Phil isn't alone. In the closing sentence of his Gettysburg Address,
Abraham Lincoln said the battle's fallen soldiers had fought so &ldquo;...that
this nation...shall have a new birth of freedom&rdquo;, with &ldquo;government of the
people, by the people, for the people&rdquo;. Lincoln called this &ldquo;unfinished
work&rdquo;.
</p><p>
More than 145 years later, it's still unfinished, and will remain so until
most ordinary citizens feel free to engage their governments directly and
personally. Until we do that, we'll be stuck with too much government of
the people, and not enough by or for the people.
</p><p>
Means for citizen involvement have always been there, but the threshold of
engagement has always seemed too high. If you wanted action, you had to be
outraged, obsessed or connected by money and other currencies of favor.
</p><p>
But then the Net came along. It didn't change everything overnight, but it
provided a whole new environment where the rules of engagement were far
different, and where privileges of the few could spread to the many.
</p><p>
Nobody knows or explains this better than Steve Urquhart, who represents
the citizens of St. George in the Utah state legislature. The first time I
talked to Steve, he told me money in politics was a red herring. What
really matters, he said, are connections. Relationships. Money is often
involved, but far from always. The real challenge for democracy, he said,
is to get more citizens involved directly at every level. This is why Steve
blogs. It's a means of engagement.
</p><p>
On July 22, 2008, Steve ran a post titled &ldquo;Transparency and
Performance&rdquo;. It serves as an exceptionally detailed frame among many
moving pictures of changes in democracy enabled by the Net. Here it is:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
When I entered the Legislature eight years ago, information was hidden from
voters....
</p><p>
Fortunately, we quickly changed our tune, and offered the public access to
lots of information. Everything I have available&mdash;in terms of access
to bills, voting records, floor and committee speeches&mdash;the public
also has....
</p><p>
Giving people direct access to information has three consequences. One,
officials pay closer attention to their actions. Two, people can more
readily hold officials accountable for their actions. And, three, officials
can be bolder in their actions. The first two points are obvious. I'll
discuss the third point.
</p><p>
Transparency allows officials to be bolder, because they have a closer,
more-informed relationship with constituents; and, in any event, there is
no place to hide. Where good information is lacking, drivel flows back and
forth between constituents and their elected officials; officials can hide
behind aphorisms, and the public has a difficult time digging them out with
a rehash of the week's editorials. Available information, however,
allows people to dig in more on their elected officials; likewise, it
allows officials to cite specifics in the record, to explain actions
that contradict the wishes of the editorialists.
</p><p>
I believe we'll see a shift in voters' concerns, at least to some
degree, away from the litmus of liberal or conservative toward a litmus of
&ldquo;conversative&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-conversative&rdquo;, with the conversative candidates
having the advantage....And, I believe that this openness signifies great
things for representative democracy.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Twelve comments follow. One is by somebody named Do What Is Right. It
reads: &ldquo;Hey Steven,
if you really wanted transparency, why do the great GOP go behind
closed doors in the capitol during the legislative sessions? You guys are
such hypocrites. Explain that one Steven.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Steve replies:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Case in point on transparency. You are repeating the media's mantra. Tell
me how many times the House Republican caucus went behind closed doors last
session. Answer: zero. Yet the media keeps on printing it, so it must be true.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
And, that's why it's still early in the story of How Democracy Works in the
networked age. We not only need to be weaned from media, but from the need
for mediation. In <span   class="emphasis"><em>Leaves of Grass</em></span>, Walt Whitman wrote this brief against
mediation:

</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
You shall no longer take things at second or third hand...
nor look through the eyes of the dead,
nor feed on the spectres in books.
You shall not look through my eyes either,
nor take things from me.
You shall listen to all sides and filter them for yourself.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Whitman also called himself a &ldquo;poet of democracy&rdquo; and wrote much about the
subject. Here's one sample, from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Specimen Days &amp;
Collect</em></span>:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Did you, too, O friend, suppose democracy was only for elections, for
politics, and for a party name? I say democracy is only of use there that
it may pass on and come to its flower and fruit in manners, in the highest
forms of interaction between men, and their beliefs....I submit, therefore,
that the fruition of democracy, on aught like a grand scale, resides
altogether in the future.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
That future is here. The time has come to complete Lincoln and Whitman's
unfinished business.
