Super Talent's Pico D USB Drive</h2></div></div><p>
The folks at Super Talent have added a new model, the Pico D, to its line
of ultra-diminutive USB Flash drives. The Pico series of USB drives,
measuring in at 1.4 inches, is an inch shorter than most USB drives on
the market today, says the company. Other features include a pivoting
lid that won't get lost, shock and water resistance and transfer speeds
up to 30MB/sec. Not to mention that the little guy is kinda cute too.

Matloff and Salzman's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Art of Debugging with GDB, DDD, and
Eclipse</em></span>
(No Starch)</h2></div></div><p>
Despite the importance of debugging, many new programmers are unaware of
techniques that reduce the time needed to find and fix programming errors.
To the rescue is the new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Art of Debugging with GDB, DDD, and
Eclipse</em></span> by Norman Matloff and Peter Jay Salzman, published by No Starch
Press. Leveraging the open-source development tools GDB, DDD and Eclipse,
the book illustrates an assortment of real-world coding errors&mdash;from
simple typos to major logical blunders&mdash;to discuss how to manage memory,
understand core dumps and trace programming errors to their root cause.
The book also covers topics that the publisher says other debugging
books omit, such as threaded, server/client, GUI and parallel programming.

As the Ajax wave surges on, one of its well-known providers, WaveMaker,
is adding new Ajax-related tools, such as Visual Ajax Studio 4.0.

build visually stunning Web applications&rdquo;. The company claims that
&ldquo;with

a sleek, Web-based application&rdquo;. The new 4.0 release offers faster
development time, better-quality applications, the company's own Live
Layout data display, enhanced drag-and-drop capabilities and IDE-quality
editing that exposes the source code and offers syntax highlighting.

and Vista.

Perforce Software's SCM System</h2></div></div><p>
Perforce 2008.1 is the latest release of Perforce Software's software
configuration management (SCM) system, which versions and manages
source code and all digital assets. The 2008.1 release extends visual
differencing functionality to images, enabling enterprise developers and
engineers to manage all content with one SCM solution. Image differencing
supports most common image files, including TIFF, JPG and GIF, and
can be extended to support other image formats through the Qt API.
Another new feature is improved remote access, which is accomplished
via the Perforce Proxy, a self-maintaining proxy server that offloads
file decompression to the client.

SEH's PS56 WLAN Print Server</h2></div></div><p>
SEH says that its new PS56 WLAN Print Server interface card will make
your network printing more secure. Utilizing the highly secure WPA
and WPA2 encryption standards, the IPv6-enabled PS56 will connect
all HP output devices with an EIO port to a wireless 802.11g network.
Because the WPA and WPA2 standards have not yet been cracked, offers
SEH, they are regarded as the safest protection for WLANs. To 
enhance security further, the PS56 also includes TLS/SSL encryption and several
IEEE 802.1X authentication methods. The interface card simply slides
into the respective slot on the printer unit and is easily configurable
and manageable.

Memopal's On-Line Backup Utility</h2></div></div><p>
European companies often get the jump on their North American counterparts
regarding the addition of Linux compatibility. A fine example is Italy's
Memopal, which now offers a Linux version of its on-line backup utility.
Memopal offers automatic and continuous backup to a remote server via
a secure Internet connection, a service that has been lacking in the
Linux space. The company claims that its Memopal Global File System
archiving technology provides a distributed filesystem that supports up
to 100 million terabytes of storage, transparent read-write compression,
hot-add scalability and more. In beta at the time of this writing, Memopal
for Linux supports Ubuntu 8.04 and Debian Etch.

calls to you at a minimum.
