<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #175, November 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>PowerPC</b></span> maintainership gradually will
migrate from <span   class="bold"><b>Paul Mackerras</b></span> to
<span   class="bold"><b>Benjamin Herrenschmidt</b></span>. The reason for taking time on the transition
is because PowerPC is a very big, very active project with trees,
branches and processes of its own. Paul's estimate is that six months
should be enough time to do the transition. But in the meantime,
Benjamin will be doing a sudden two-week takeover of the project while
Paul is on vacation. This involves setting up a new git tree and
relevant branches, and starting to accept patches from the large group
of contributors. It's not clear whether success in the two-week period
will shorten the overall transition, but it certainly will be a good
test run.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>OProfile</b></span> also probably is changing
maintainership. Because this involves
both a kernel and user-space code set, there are several issues.
<span   class="bold"><b>Robert Richter</b></span> will be taking over from
<span   class="bold"><b>Philippe Elie</b></span> as maintainer of
the kernel portion. It's also unclear whether Philippe is onboard with
this change, so it may turn out that OProfile has some deeper
communication issues between the developers. The user-space portion of
OProfile also seems to be changing hands, though not as formally as
with kernel code.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>kmemcheck</b></span> code now has an official
maintainer&mdash;or actually two official
maintainers. <span   class="bold"><b>Vegard Nossum</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Pekka Enberg</b></span> will share
maintainership. The kmemcheck patch is a cool little debugging tool
that logs whenever memory is read that had not been
written previously. Clearly, there's a bug if we're trying to read data from a
location to which we never wrote.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>ZFS</b></span> filesystem may start to have more of a presence in the
official kernel tree. <span   class="bold"><b>Sun</b></span> has released a read-only version of the
filesystem under the GPL. This is pretty cool, but not as cool as if
Sun had released the whole thing. A read-write version could be useful
to anyone, but the read-only version will be useful really only to
people who've been using <span   class="bold"><b>Solaris</b></span>. In its full form, ZFS is a very
interesting filesystem&mdash;it can handle multiple exabytes of storage,
pools multiple block devices seamlessly together, checksums
everything and snapshots the history of all data changes on the
filesystem. <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span> speculates that ZFS may be one of the only things
keeping Solaris alive as an operating system, and that this is why Sun
doesn't want to GPL the full code. Even if a read-write version were
open sourced though, there still are patents covering parts of ZFS,
and those patents currently are being fiercely litigated by Sun and
<span   class="bold"><b>NetApp</b></span>. Even if the source code were fully available, the problem of
getting permission to use the patents might be too thorny to overcome.
In the meantime, <span   class="bold"><b>Kevin Winchester</b></span> has volunteered to port the
read-only code into Linux, and he'll almost certainly have help&mdash;or
at least advice&mdash;from <span   class="bold"><b>Christoph
Hellwig</b></span>. <span   class="bold"><b>Ricardo Correia</b></span> also
is attempting to rewrite ZFS from scratch as a <span   class="bold"><b>FUSE-based filesystem</b></span>.
Ricardo's work already has made great strides, to the point where
<span   class="bold"><b>Patrick Draper</b></span>, for one, has been able to use it for all his data.
However, anyone trying it out, he cautions, should be sure to back stuff
up.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Karsten Keil</b></span> submitted <span   class="bold"><b>mISDN</b></span>, a driver intended to replace the <span   class="bold"><b>I4L
architecture</b></span> for <span   class="bold"><b>passive ISDN
cards</b></span>. The new architecture is apparently
a big improvement, as folks like <span   class="bold"><b>Tillman
Schmidt</b></span>, who maintain the old
I4L drivers, are very excited to get started using it.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>touchscreen driver</b></span> continues to graft new and exciting touchscreen
hardware onto its list of supported devices. <span   class="bold"><b>Alastair
Bridgewater</b></span>
recently added support for the <span   class="bold"><b>eGalax
touchscreen</b></span> used in the <span   class="bold"><b>HP
tx1305us tablet PC</b></span> as well as in other devices. Part of the problem
with supporting all these different pieces of hardware is that the
driver has to detect them by probing their various behaviors. This can
lead to some very subtle weirdness, as Alastair discovered when his
first patch submission was rejected on the grounds that it didn't
programmatically detect the eGalax hardware.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>David Altobelli</b></span> has submitted code
supporting the <span   class="bold"><b>HP iLO/iLO2
management processor</b></span>, used by system administrators to access servers
remotely instead of at the console.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Michael Buesch</b></span> has written a driver
supporting the <span   class="bold"><b>GPIO pins</b></span> on all
<span   class="bold"><b>Brooktree 8xx chips</b></span>. GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output) pins are used
for both input and output, depending on how they're configured.
Michael's code supports that configuration. After a bit of trouble
locating the appropriate maintainer, <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew
Morton</b></span> finally pointed
Michael to <span   class="bold"><b>David Brownell</b></span>, who could receive the patch.

<h2 class="title">Lifting the Fog from Cloud Computing</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #175, November 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Back in August 2008, at LinuxWorld in San Francisco, the big buzzword was
&ldquo;Cloud
Computing&rdquo;. It's a neat concept, but after a week of hearing folks talk
about &ldquo;in the cloud&rdquo;, I was about at the end of my rope. To add insult
to injury, it seemed that the San Francisco fog confused many folks, and
&ldquo;Cloud Computing&rdquo; started to be used synonymously with
&ldquo;Grid Computing&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Clustered Virtualization&rdquo; and &ldquo;My Company Is
Cool&rdquo;.
</p><p>
For clarity's sake, I thought a brief vocabulary lesson was in order.
Cloud computing is indeed a viable, exciting idea&mdash;but it helps if we all
know what we're talking about.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The idea behind cloud computing is that services, not servers, are offered
to the end user. If people need a Web server, they buy Web services from
the &ldquo;cloud&rdquo;, and have no idea what is actually offering them the serving.
The &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; essentially hides the server infrastructure from the client,
and ideally scales on the fly and so on. Much of the confusion in
terminology happens, because the cloud of services almost always is powered
by a grid of computers in the background. Cloud computing itself, however,
is just the abstraction of services away from servers themselves.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The advantage is that a vendor can offer more reliable, diverse and
scalable services to a user without the cost of dedicating hardware to each
user. This allows for more graceful temporary spikes (Slashdot, Digg and
so on), while not letting servers sit idle during low times. Because the back
end is transparent to the user, those actual grids of computers in the
background can be geographically diverse, and oftentimes virtualized for
easy migration, all without any end-user interaction. Ideally, it offers
a reliable &ldquo;service&rdquo; to the end user, at a lower cost, and gives vendors
flexibility in the back end, so they can manage servers in the most
efficient way possible.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Most people don't realize that cloud computing ultimately is shared hosting.
Vendors avoid terms like &ldquo;shared hosting&rdquo;, because that implies multiple
people sharing a single computer. By its strictest definition, however,
cloud computing certainly could be run from a single back-end server. With
current scalability and virtualization technologies, vendors have much
more robust ways to serve to the &ldquo;cloud&rdquo;, and the traditional
hangups with
shared hosting are largely eliminated. Still, it's important to understand
what cloud computing really is, so you don't get fooled into buying more or
less than what you truly need.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
What sort of back-end servers are you running?
</p></li><li><p>
Do you have the ability to fail over to a secondary data center behind the
cloud, transparent to me?
</p></li><li><p>
How do you differ from traditional shared hosting? (This one should
spark some heated retorts!)
</p></li><li><p>
How well do you scale, and how does pricing work for occasional spikes?
</p></li></ul></div></div>

<h2 class="title">Keeping the Kernel Klean</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #175, November 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Operating systems drive devices. Linux is driven by open-source
imperatives. So, naturally, Linux's kernel developers have a problem with
closed-source kernel modules. And, just as naturally, they've hacked up a
statement they hope will discourage the closed and encourage the open.
</p><p>
On his blog, Greg Kroah-Hartman explained, &ldquo;As part of the Linux Foundation
Technical board...we wanted to do something that could be seen as a
general 'public statement' about them that is easy to understand and point
to when people have questions&rdquo;. Here it is:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Position Statement on Linux Kernel Modules, June 2008
</p><p>
We, the undersigned Linux kernel developers, consider any closed-source
Linux kernel module or driver to be harmful and undesirable. We have
repeatedly found them to be detrimental to Linux users, businesses and the
greater Linux ecosystem. Such modules negate the openness, stability,
flexibility and maintainability of the Linux development model and shut
their users off from the expertise of the Linux community. Vendors that
provide closed-source kernel modules force their customers to give up key
Linux advantages or choose new vendors. Therefore, in order to take full
advantage of the cost savings and shared support benefits open source has
to offer, we urge vendors to adopt a policy of supporting their customers
on Linux with open-source kernel code.
</p><p>
We speak only for ourselves, and not for any company we might work for
today, have in the past or will in the future.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Below that are 176 names.
</p><p>
The Linux Foundation has a slightly broader statement:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The Linux Foundation recommends that hardware manufacturers provide
open-source kernel modules. The open-source nature of Linux is intrinsic to its
success. We encourage manufacturers to work with the kernel community to
provide open-source kernel modules in order to enable their users and
themselves to take advantage of the considerable benefits that Linux makes
possible. We agree with the Linux kernel developers that vendors who
provide closed-source kernel modules force their customers to give up these
key Linux advantages. We urge all vendors to adopt a policy of supporting
their customers on Linux with open-source kernel modules.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Either way the message is clear.

<div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The slow adoption of Vista among businesses and budget-conscious CIOs,
coupled with the proven success of a new type of Microsoft-free PC in every
region, provides an extraordinary window of opportunity for
Linux....We'll work to unlock the desktop to save our customers money
and give freedom of choice by offering this industry-leading solution.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Linux should stop copying Windows circa 2001 and rather look at what Apple
is doing these days around usability and design. I understand that to gain
acceptance for new software it makes it easier for users if you mimic the
behavior of the old software, but at some time, you need to step out and
innovate in the user interface.
</p><p>
This &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; might just be driving maximum consistency in
look and feel. I want to at least feel that the system is held together by
well-engineered common design principles and APIs rather than aging string
and bubble gum.
</p><p>
Open-source projects like WordPress have attracted excellent graphic
designers to build themes and skins. We need more graphic designers
involved with open source. We need to build more software so that others
can make it look great.
</p><p>
There are certainly many in the general Open Source community who
understand this and are working toward this goal.

Here's another neutral, open network: the electricity grid. It's
transparent, open, anybody can do anything on it. As long as you know the
protocols, you can plug any technology in to it. We can imagine a world where
when you plugged something in, the network asked, &ldquo;Is it a Panasonic or a
Sony TV you're plugging in?&rdquo; &ldquo;Is it radio or
television?&rdquo; &ldquo;Is it pay TV or
free TV?&rdquo; And then, depending upon the answer to these questions, allocate
the resource according to that information. It's possible to imagine an
electricity grid like that, but would it be better?

<h2 class="title">What They're Using: Alan Robertson's Eee PC Tote-Bag Hack</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #175, November 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I ran into Alan Robertson at LinuxWorld in August 2008, at a keynote given by
an IBM executive. Alan works for IBM, where his title is Senior Software
Engineer, Business Resilience. That's biz-speak for Alan's leading work on
High-Availability Linux. It was while talking about the latter that Alan let
slip that he uses an ASUS Eee PC.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10221whatf1.large.jpg"><img src="10221whatf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Alan Robertson
</p></div></div><p>
I was fascinated by the extreme polarity in scale between Linux-HA&mdash;with
its heartbeat-enabled death-of-node detection, cluster management and other
mission-critical industrial-grade uses&mdash;and the hot little portable. When
we got to a table where he could show off the machine, Alan pulled out of
his knapsack what looked like a colorful striped purse. It was an accessory
bag Alan had hacked to hold the Eee PC as if it were nothing more than an
extra battery. It was way cool.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10221whatf2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Eee PC Bag Hack
</p></div></div><p>
&ldquo;The deal is...it's supposed to be just for cables that you carry with
your regular laptop, but it happens to fit the Eee PC&rdquo;, he said. That's
because the bag comes with three pockets on each side, and Alan removed the
two lines of stitching on one side, giving it one pocket for the Eee PC and
three for its accessories. The result is an all-in-one case that's
custom-hacked for the Eee PC, which fits snugly inside the de-stitched
side, across from its relatively tiny AC power supply and whatever other
small stuff you'd like to carry with it.
</p><p>
Alan's Eee PC has the new 9-inch screen, 20GB of solid-state storage and
stock Xandros distro. Beyond its dimensional virtues, Alan likes the Wi-Fi
signal-finding utility, because &ldquo;it shows you the DHCP
negotiation&rdquo; and
&ldquo;all that stuff you need to know&rdquo; if something isn't
working&mdash;which it
too often doesn't with Wi-Fi. He also showed off the Eee PC's multitouch,
which I hadn't seen working before outside of an iPhone. And, he noted how
well Skype is integrated with Linux. &ldquo;Skype already knows about the
Webcam...so if I were video-conferencing you, it would just come up and
work.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Alan's main laptop for work is still a Lenovo ThinkPad 360p. He notes that
the airline seat power supply for that one weighs more than the Eee PC does
by itself. Meanwhile, his Eee PC is a nice little all-in-four (pockets)
portability solution.
</p><p>
If you're interested in Alan's bag hack, you want BuiltNY's &ldquo;charger
bag&rdquo;.
It comes in four color themes: brown/mint green, wood-grain black/slate,
black/powder blue, and Alan's version, called stripe #7/lava. BuiltNY
retails the bag on its Web site for $25, but at the time of this writing, Amazon sells
it for $13.97. Either way, it's in alignment with the Eee PC's own downscale
cost.
