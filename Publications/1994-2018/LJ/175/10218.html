Read a good book about Web development lately? Reuven has and is happy
to share his latest favorites with you.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x173d580.0x1835358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Remember the Web? You know, that combination of Internet technologies
that will make paper obsolete? Well, it's true that many newspaper
and magazine publishers are hurting, and that many people (including
me) now read things on-line that we previously read on paper. And, for Web
developers in particular, the Web provides a treasure trove of
information, ranging from blogs and articles to forums and IRC
channels.
</p><p>
Based on the flurry of content that is available on-line, and the
reported death of print media, you might think that the number and
quality of Web-related books also has declined in recent years. From
what I can tell, however, the opposite is true. I continue to see a
large number of high-quality books from a number of different
publishers, on topics that are relevant and interesting. Even better,
I have found many of these books to be useful in my day-to-day work,
giving me perspective on technologies I already knew and teaching me
many things that I hadn't previously known.
</p><p>
This month, I describe a few of the books that have most recently
crossed my desk, which I have found to be the most helpful and
interesting. This is an admittedly skewed sample. During the past few
years, most of my work has been with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL and
JavaScript, and also on looking at how to make Web sites more explicitly
&ldquo;social&rdquo;, with a large number of interactions among the participants.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x173d580.0x1835618"></a>
Ruby on Rails</h2></div></div><p>
I have been working with Ruby on Rails for several years now and
continue to see it as a breath of fresh air. After years in which I
had to work directly with a database, writing explicit SQL queries,
it's a delight to be able to think about things at the object level,
rather than at the row-and-column level. Admittedly, some
performance issues exist with Rails, but when you want to create a Web
application quickly and easily, nothing else comes close. (Actually,
that's not exactly true. If I hadn't been smitten by Rails, I
probably would be using Django today. And, there are several
Rails-like application frameworks out there, including CakePHP and
Catalyst, both of which have their fans.)
</p><p>
The now-classic, standard text for beginning Rails programmers is the
second edition of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Agile Web Development with Ruby on
Rails</em></span>, written
by Dave Thomas and David Heinemeier Hansson, and published by the
Pragmatic Programmers (ISBN 978-0977616633). This edition is due to
be superseded by a third edition by the time you read this column, so
some of my comments might not be relevant anymore. But, I generally have
had mixed feelings about the first and second editions of
this book. On the one hand, it successfully got me excited about
Rails and provided me with a useful introduction back when I was
first starting with it. At the same time, I kept searching for an
introductory book with a slightly different style that I could
recommend to beginning Rails developers.
</p><p>
One particularly strong introductory Rails book is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Simply Rails
2</em></span>,
by Patrick Lenz (ISBN 978-0980455205). This book introduces a large
number of key Rails features, including the MVC architecture,
associations, testing, Ajax, some elements of Prototype and
script.aculo.us, and even debugging with tools, such as ruby-debug. Because Lenz aims to cover less ground in his book, he
manages to make a more effective tutorial than <span   class="emphasis"><em>Agile Web
Development with Ruby on
Rails</em></span>.
Frequently interspersed code samples, screenshots and diagrams make
this a particularly accessible book.
</p><p>
Once you have finished with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Simply Rails 2</em></span>, you will need a
reference guide that describes the Rails architecture in greater
depth, with a more comprehensive list of features. Obie Fernandez's
book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Rails Way</em></span> (ISBN 978-0321445612), is an excellent, detailed
and thick resource, although I think it mentions (and emphasizes)
routes and RESTful architecture a bit early for many newcomers.
That's probably fine, given that this book is not meant to be a
tutorial, but rather a reference and advanced guide. So, although I
strongly recommend this book and use it several times a week as a
reference for my own work, it doesn't do the trick as an introduction
or tutorial.
</p><p>
Good complements to <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Rails Way</em></span>, and to one another, are three
similarly named books from two different publishers: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Rails
Cookbook</em></span>,
by Rob Orsini (ISBN 978-0596527310); <span   class="emphasis"><em>Rails Recipes</em></span>, by Chad Fowler
(ISBN 978-0977616602); and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Rails Recipes</em></span>, by Mike Clark
(ISBN 978-0978739225). Each of these books follows the now-standard
format of having many short chapters, each addressing a common
problem developers might encounter. Each of these books
contains multiple recipes that have given me ideas, and even when I
haven't used the recipe directly, I have found them to be useful food
for thought. I'm also not sure whether the third book is truly as
advanced as its title would indicate.
</p><p>
Finally, the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Deploying Rails Applications</em></span>, by Ezra
Zygmuntowicz, Bruce Tate and Clinton Begin (ISBN 978-0978739201), has
a great deal of practical advice about taking a Rails application and
making it available to the general public. The authors guide you
through using version control (with Subversion), configuring one or
more production servers, deploying with Capistrano and identifying
bottlenecks. The book assumes you are using MySQL, which means
people who use PostgreSQL (like me) can ignore some of the
advice. There also is a chapter on Windows deployment that I expect
most readers of this column can ignore.
</p><p>
The authors assume you want to deploy your application with a
combination of Mongrel (for dynamic, Ruby-generated content) and nginx
(for static content), while ignoring such possibilities as Phusion
(aka mod_rails), an Apache module that some sites have been using
with great success. Then again, Zygmuntowicz is the founder of Engine
Yard, a Rails hosting company that has been enjoying great success, so it might be wise to follow his lead. Regardless of the
specific implementation choices the authors suggest, this book
helps put each aspect of Rails deployment into perspective, and it's
good reading for people who plan to make their applications public.

JavaScript and CSS</h2></div></div><p>
It used to be that a Web developer could get away with working only on
the server side, allowing designers to handle everything from
JavaScript to CSS. But, as Web applications have become more dynamic
and have incorporated more Ajax, it has become increasingly important
for all developers to understand and master these technologies.
</p><p>
For all of the buzz around JavaScript, seasoned Web developers know
that it is a flawed language, partly in its design and partly in its
implementation. One of the best-known JavaScript gurus, Douglas
Crockford, recently wrote a short (but excellent) book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>JavaScript:
The Good Parts</em></span> (ISBN 978-0596517748). My understanding of JavaScript
has been helped a great deal by Crockford's previous writing and
lectures, and the book has helped me to appreciate this language more.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em></span> has helped me understand why I have been so frustrated by
JavaScript in the past&mdash;beyond issues of browser compatibility. By
ignoring the bad parts of JavaScript, the frustration level drops
considerably.
</p><p>
Even if you take Crockford's advice into consideration, you 
almost certainly will want to choose a JavaScript library, such as
Prototype, jQuery, YUI or Dojo. I have explored some of these
libraries in this column over the past few years, with a heavy
emphasis on Prototype, because it is included with the Rails
framework. However, there are many good things to say about the
others&mdash;and in many cases, you might have no say over which library
you use. For example, I have started to do some work with the
open-source Moodle system for on-line learning, which uses YUI as its
toolkit. Similarly, the Django framework for Web development now
includes the Dojo toolkit, so you should expect to work with Dojo if
you do any Django development.
</p><p>
Although I have been very impressed with Yahoo's YUI toolkit, my default
JavaScript library remains Prototype, in no small part because of its
close relationship with Ruby on Rails. (The Prototype developers are
part of the Rails core team, and development between the two is
synchronized.) The Web site for Prototype (<a href="http://prototypejs.org" target="_self">prototypejs.org</a>)
has excellent documentation and even a downloadable PDF version of
the API. But, this wasn't sufficient for some introductory classes
that I recently gave about Prototype programming, so I have been
on the lookout for a high-quality tutorial.
</p><p>
Thus, I was pleased to discover <span   class="emphasis"><em>Practical Prototype and
script.aculo.us</em></span>, by Andrew Dupont (ISBN 978-1590599198), which is one
of the best programming books I have read in the last few months.
It introduces Prototype (and its companion GUI toolkit,
script.aculo.us) with on-target, practical and illuminating examples&mdash;along with a sense of humor I found refreshing, without
getting in the way.
</p><p>
Modern Web pages are styled with cascading stylesheets (CSS), a
technology that is quite simple to understand in theory, but it can
become complicated when it comes to execution. One book that seems to
offer a gentle introduction to CSS is <span   class="emphasis"><em>The CSS
Anthology</em></span>, by Rachel
Andrew (ISBN 978-0975841983). This book is a cross between a tutorial
and a cookbook, allowing you to learn CSS in the context of bite-sized
lessons and ideas.
</p><p>
Once you have understood the basics of JavaScript and CSS, and what
they can do for your dynamic Web sites, you might want to look at
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dynamic HTML: The Definitive Reference</em></span>, by Danny Goodman (ISBN
978-0596527402). This book looks at the DOM&mdash;the document object
model browsers use to work with HTML&mdash;and explains how
you can modify its appearance, as well as manipulate its elements,
using a combination of JavaScript and CSS. This book doesn't use any
JavaScript library, so some of the JavaScript code might seem long and
unwieldy if you are used to the brevity of Prototype. But, for sheer
comprehensiveness, nothing beats this book.
</p><p>
The similarly comprehensive latest edition of David Flanagan's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</em></span> (ISBN 978-0596101992) is useful
when you want to better understand what JavaScript is doing or how an
object is defined. Douglas Crockford has noted that this is the only
JavaScript book that actually gets the details right. That might be
true, but it doesn't change the fact that the text can be quite
dense. Don't try to learn JavaScript from this book, but you should
have it around afterward, either to refresh your memory or to gain a
clearer understanding of how things work.
</p><p>
Finally, I have found <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Ultimate CSS Reference</em></span>, by Tommy Olsson
and Paul O'Brien (ISBN 978-0-980285857), to be a useful list of CSS
selectors, properties and values. Especially useful is the table
indicating the degree to which each browser complies with the CSS
standard for each property. The information in this book is available
elsewhere, but it is particularly handy if I am not connected to the
Internet (which, I'm ashamed to admit, is sometimes the case), or if I
just want to skim through a number of related items. My main
complaint with this book is its lack of an index, and although I realize
you can read and search much of it on-line, adding 5&ndash;10 pages of
index would have changed this from a good book into an excellent one.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x173d580.0x18363d8"></a>
Social Networking</h2></div></div><p>
Facebook, LinkedIn and other social-networking sites are all the
rage, and I even have looked at some aspects of these sites in this
column.
</p><p>
If you're interested in creating your own social-networking site, two
books might be of interest to you. The first,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>RailsSpace</em></span>, 
written by Michael Hartl and Aurelius Prochazka (ISBN 978-0321480798),
describes how to create a simple social site with users, friends
and Ajax-based blogs. The source code to RailsSpace has been made
available, so you can use the code to build your own, real-world site,
rather than merely go through the tutorials. Even better, one of the
authors (Hartl) has founded an open-source project called Insoshi
(<a href="http://www.insoshi.com" target="_self">www.insoshi.com</a>), which offers a downloadable framework for
creating social networking sites.
</p><p>
A second book on the subject, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Practical Rails Social Networking
Sites</em></span>, by Alan Bradburne (ISBN 978-1590598412), is a bit more
ambitious in the projects it aims to do, showing examples not
only of users and friendship links, but also of e-mail, discussion
forums, a photo gallery, user-created themes and a mobile interface.
The code from this book is used to power the RailsCoders site
(<a href="http://www.railscoders.net" target="_self">www.railscoders.net</a>), and it similarly can be downloaded and used
to power a real-world site.
</p><p>
No matter what toolkit you use, or whether you decide to create a social
site on your own, you should consider the wider implications of what
you are doing. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Designing for the Social Web</em></span>, by Joshua Porter (ISBN
978-0321534927), is one of the most interesting books I've read on the
subject to date, and it's full of practical advice on how people
participate in a site. A slightly less practical, but no less
interesting book is Clay Shirky's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Here Comes Everybody</em></span> (ISBN
978-1594201530). His analysis of the social Web, and how groups are
now collaborating before they fully know each other and define
themselves, is full of interesting anecdotes, but also cautionary
tales about what the designers of such sites should consider when
deploying.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Perhaps the printing press is going the way of the dodo bird. But for
the time being, there are plenty of books that I find not only useful
and interesting, but also essential as I go about my daily life as a
developer and consultant. If you have read a particularly interesting
and useful book you think I should know about, please send me
e-mail. I am always happy to learn about new, high-quality books, and if it turns out to be particularly useful, I'll be happy to
share it with other readers of this column.
