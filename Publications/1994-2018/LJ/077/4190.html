privacy</p><p>&ldquo;At this stage in my life, the thing that really turns me on
is competence.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;Billy Joel</p><p>&ldquo;Science would be superfluous if the outward appearance and
the essence of things directly coincided.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;Karl Marx</p><p>&ldquo;Certum est, quia impossibile. (It is certain, because it is
impossible.)&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;Tertullianus</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell is content? Nobody buys content. Real people
pay money for music because it means something to them. Being a
&ldquo;content provider&rdquo; is prostitution work that devalues our art and
doesn't satisfy our spirits. Artistic expression has to be

art is reduced to content, they may never have the opportunity to

guesswork. Each pile of results is presented with an implication:
&ldquo;Here's what we think you want.&rdquo;</p><p>But most serious researchers (i.e., Yours Truly and all
<i  >Linux Journal</i> readers) often don't want an
engine to guess. These users want to search for specific
strings&mdash;or, as some search engines put it, phrases. These include
names, text passages, lines of code, diseases and all other series
of words.</p><p>On December 3, 1999 and June 27, 2000, I tested fifteen of
the most familiar search engines by searching for a relatively
unique phrase: &ldquo;He that by me spreads a wider breast than my
own&rdquo;, which is part of a familiar line from Walt Whitman's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Song of Myself</em></span>. The phrase occurs far from the
beginning of the work and can be found in many documents on the
Web, including one on my own site,
<a href="http://www.searls.com" target="_self">http://www.searls.com/</a>.</p><p>It's a tough test. Only those engines that deeply search an
enormous range of sites will yield results. The word &ldquo;breast&rdquo; is
also a common and controversial word, which might invite spurious
results.</p><p>Testing for strings also isn't easy on the tester, since
search engines have different ways of recognizing phrases. Most
require quotes. Others (Hotbot, FAST) have pop-out menu commands.
One (Yahoo!) requires clicking a radio button in &ldquo;advanced&rdquo;
search mode. Others (mostly at the bottom in the surveys) don't
search phrases at all.</p><p>I run this test quite often for my own purposes and rarely
record the results. But last December I did record them, and I
repeated the test again on June 27&mdash;nearly seven months later. This
time I added two more tests: one for an obscure blood disorder and
the other for a Linux system call. Here are the results:</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4190bf1.large.jpg"><img src="4190bf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Test Phrase I</p></div></div>
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4190bf2.large.jpg"><img src="4190bf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Test Phrase II</p></div></div>
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4190bf3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. Test Phrase III</p></div></div>
</p><p>As you see, FAST won the first search, by a wide margin, just
as it did in December. But Google (see Jason Schumaker's
&ldquo;Interview with Sergey Brin&rdquo;, page ??) is the clear winner of the
second and third searches&mdash;and didn't do too bad on the first,
either.</p><p>Near as I could tell, none of the engines fell for the
&ldquo;breast&rdquo; bait&mdash;at least not in phrase search mode. On that one,
they all get a passing grade.</p><p>Some of the results, however, were amazing. Go.com found
&ldquo;29,024,074 matches&rdquo; in the first search, but nothing I wanted.
The first ten results all related to breastfeeding or breast
cancer. No porn, of course. But I did get a banner ad featuring a
happy-looking woman in a cleavage bra. &ldquo;BREAST AUGMENTATION?&rdquo; it
asked. &ldquo;Looking for breast augmentation from a doctor in your
area? CLICK HERE.&rdquo; Nice guess, guys.</p><p>As we can see, search is consolidating as a business
category. By the time you read this, Yahoo! will be using Google
(in a deal struck one day before this survey). Other partnerships
and cross-investments are sure to follow (Lycos recently bought a
15% stake in FAST, for example). My guess is that there will be
fewer search engines by the time you read this.</p><p>I just hope there aren't fewer good ones.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Doc Searls (<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>) is Senior

too many bad software patents now, wait until October. USPTO
Director Q. Todd Dickinson warns of an imminent &ldquo;reduction in
patent quality&rdquo; when he has to reduce his staff by 1,000 people,
including more than 500 patent examiners, out of a total of about
5,000, and cut back or reduce examiners' access to on-line
databases. USPTO now has about 3,200 patent examiners.</p><p>In a letter to Howard Coble (R-NC) and Howard Berman (D-CA),
Chairman and senior Democrat of the House Subcommittee on Courts
and Intellectual Property respectively, Dickinson also warns that
many patents may be delayed or not issued at all because of the
tight budget for fiscal 2001, which begins in October of this year.
The letter is online at
<a href="http://www.uspto.gov/c_b_directorresponse.pdf" target="_self">www.uspto.gov/c_b_directorresponse.pdf</a></p><p>News for job hunters: the USPTO is hiring patent examiners.
As a software patent examiner, you will be responsible for
researching and understanding the history of inventions, patented
or non-patented, in your field and making the decision to grant or
refuse patents. According to the USPTO web site, salaries for
patent examiners in Engineering and Computer Science range from
$27,778 to $53,544. There's a 10% recruitment bonus for computer
science and electrical engineering specialists.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x234e580.0x2447898"></a><i  >LJ</i> INDEX&mdash;September 2000</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Percentage of people who find packaging annoying:

Kerbango!</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4190sf1.jpg"></div><p>The Kerbango Radio, one of the first true Internet
appliances, looks like a cross between an old Wurlitzer jukebox and
the dashboard of a '54 Buick. It also looks like it'll belong to
3Com soon. On June 27, 2000, 3Com announced that it was buying
Kerbango for $80 million in stock. Not bad for a company that was
only announced last Fall, employed only 28 people, and still hadn't
produced its first and only product. (Though the Kerbango radio is
expected to roll out shortly.)</p><p>Right now, Kerbango has three unique properties, the radio,
its tuning system and its web site, which gives computer users
direct access to thousands of stream sources&mdash;the &ldquo;stations&rdquo; the
Kerbango radio will tune when it sits on your kitchen counter,
plugged into the household network, listening to streams (those
modern &ldquo;signals&rdquo;) over your DSL or cable line (or even dial-up,
if you're willing to put up with modem-grade lo-fi).</p><p>The most significant fact about Kerbango, for our purposes,
is the operating system at the heart of the blue box. That would be
Linux. We're talking about the same embedded Linux that's the
subject of our cover feature this month.</p><p>3Com has reason to be eager in this market. IDC expects the
Information Appliance business to grow from $2.4 billion to $17.8
billion between 1999 and 2004. This would represent an increase
from 11 to 89 million units. Surely a significant part of that 1999
figure is 3Com's own Palm Computing business.</p><p>Kerbango was also moving along at a nice clip when the 3Com
deal was announced. In a separate agreement, THOMSON multimedia
signed a Letter of Intent with Kerbango to brand and distribute an
RCA brand Internet Radio that utilizes the Kerbango Internet Radio
Tuning Service. 3Com also said it intends to follow a similar
licensing strategy with its partners. Presumably that would include
Palm.</p><p>When this news came in, we got in touch with Jim Gamble,
Kerbango's President, and subjected him to a series of snarky
questions. Here's how the dialog went.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Will the name
stay?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: Yes.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Can 3Com actually brand
anything?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: Seems like Palm did
okay! They grew that from start up to multinational success. I've
got no problem re-running that scenario for our radio...</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Will Kerbango remain
independent?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: We will be a separate
group inside 3Com. They want us to push the radio and our tuning
service. In fact, their main input early on has been, &ldquo;how can we
help you do more faster?&rdquo;</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: What will 3Com's
&ldquo;internet audio division&rdquo; do, and where will Kerbango fit in
that? Will the brand include more than the radio?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: The radio and the
tuning service is the start. More products will come later
too.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Got any market size
projections?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: Most of the projections
are for generic &ldquo;Internet appliances&rdquo; which conceivably covers a
lot of ground. I look at the Arbitron data on Internet radio usage
and see that 11 million listeners a month in the U.S. alone is a
good market to go after. Too early to say how our numbers will
go.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Will the U.S. finally
regain market leadership at the Networked edge of what we've been
calling &ldquo;consumer electronics?&rdquo;</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: I think so. But it will
have an international flavor since companies like THOMSON/RCA (who
announced they will be shipping a Kerbango powered Internet radio)
are thoroughly multinational.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>:
What we're sensing here at <i  >Linux Journal</i> is that there is finally a
chance that previously non-communicating devices in the home will
become Net native and start relating at least with their owners, if
not with each other&mdash;and that XML-based Instant Messaging will lead
the way. Kerbango as a stand alone company didn't play a very big
potential role in this scenario; but perhaps Kerbango as the
household appliance brand of 3Com could play a huge role.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: Hope so! We view it
more as &ldquo;building a better radio&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;building an
Internet appliance&rdquo;. Maybe just semantics, but it makes sense to
us.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: We realize this is
blue-sky stuff at this point, but being part of 3Com does open the
sky a bit. Or maybe the opposite. 3Com has a fine football stadium,
but their mass market presence beyond that hasn't exactly been
obvious. Some companies are born to brand and promote and make
people want their cool stuff. Is 3Com ready to be the next
Sony?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: As we like to say at
Kerbango, Stay Tuned!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x234e580.0x27533c0"></a>THE BUZZ</h2></div></div><p>What were people talking about in June and early July? Below
