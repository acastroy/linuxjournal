in the computer lexicon [sic]. He or she represents, rather
unfairly, the dogmatist ever-ready to promote MyGol over YourGol.
They (to switch to the gender-free plural) are also wont to niggle
and squiggle over <span   class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span> jot and tittle. Not
just the jots and tittles in the source code are fair game (after
all, that misplaced semicolon can cost rockets and lives), but also
the fuzzier jots and tittles in a natural-language document such as
press releases, pattern proposals, or ISO standards.
</p><p>We should not be surprised, therefore, if fervently supported
socio-computer &ldquo;movements&rdquo; betray many of the exegetical biblical
excesses noted by historians of religion. (Not to be confused with
religious historians.)</p><p>The unavoidable keywords are &ldquo;schism&rdquo; and &ldquo;syncretism.&rdquo;
In particular, the OSS (Open Source Software) agendum, one with
&ldquo;community&rdquo; written into and between every syllable, is now
subject to inter-commune dissension. It takes only a few agendums
to create an agenda. And Church Father, Eric Raymond, added to the
religious dimension with his <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cathedral and the
Bazaar</em></span> discourse.</p><p>This columnist was tickled by the diverse opinions reported
in &ldquo;We Talk to Everybody&rdquo; (<i  >Linux Journal</i>,
June 2000). The disciples were typically opposed on vital
fundamentals (the telltale sign).</p><p>Compare this, briefly, to St. Paul's efforts in fusing
messianic Judaism and pagan Platonism to spread the gospel through
a hostile Roman empire. Christianity endures as a major world
&ldquo;belief system&rdquo; (yes, this must sound cold and offensive to
believers) in spite of almost daily &ldquo;cultic&rdquo; splits that outscore
the welcomed annual ecumenical reunions. (Walter Martin, the
original &ldquo;Bible Answer Man&rdquo;, had a marvelous term for petty
disputations: &ldquo;majoring in the minors&rdquo;.)</p><p>You may have guessed that I'm pondering impious parallels
with the Linux gospel. Of course, analogies should never be pushed
beyond luck or reason, but it's worth a try if lessons are to be
learned. It took several Trent Councils to resolve the trinitarian
bits, so let's be patient with the LSB (Linux Standard Base) canon.
But not overly patient&mdash;I'm prepared to sizzle dumb opponents with
a just auto-da-fe.</p><p>Martin Scorsese and I, about to film <span   class="emphasis"><em>Son of Last
Temptations</em></span>, have no problem casting Richard Stallman as
John the Baptizer and Linus Torvalds as St. Paul. We'll risk the
odd anachronism (U.S. viewers will hardly notice) by having the
Pauline epistolary admonishments sent by e-mail. We'll show some
messages bouncing from corinthians.org and romans.mil. Mel Brooks
has scripted a catchy letter to the Hebrews. Our studio historical
research team tells us that the Galatians were unruly Celts, so we
plan to exploit this fact for the Irish-American audience. FreeBSD
will appear as the Essenes writing those &ldquo;Dead-C&rdquo; scrolls.</p><p>Lots of cast gaps remain for major and minor prophets, not to
mention profits. I see Turing as Job, von Neumann as Abraham,
Ritchie/Thompson as Ezekiel/Isaiah and, subject to legal approval,
Gates must get the nod for Satan. Judas? All we can say at the
moment is that he or she wears a red hat. I'm currently co-favorite
with Stallone for the major messianic role. I have the edge in C++
syntax, but he just punched me in the gob, screaming
&ldquo;ggg-nooo&rdquo;.</p><p>Coming Soon (September 2000): the ultimate book on Linux
Security from Prentice Hall PTR: Bob Toxen's Real World Linux
Security&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Intrusion Prevention, Detection and
Recovery</em></span>, including a CD-ROM of vital programs to reduce
your &ldquo;vulnerabilities&rdquo;.</p></div></div>
