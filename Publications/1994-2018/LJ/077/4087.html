    How I learned to stop worrying and love the Cron.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f0580.0x1ae86b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Today, in our ongoing series on learning
to live with Linux's &ldquo;inner d&aelig;mons&rdquo;, we are going to look
at two d&aelig;mons that schedule job execution on Linux. These
d&aelig;mons are more or less exactly like those found on virtually
every UNIX out there. (Linux has separate d&aelig;mons for
<span   class="bold"><b>at</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span>. Old versions of Linux used a
program called &ldquo;atrun&rdquo;, which was run in root's crontab once a
minute to execute at requests. Some other Unix operating systems
have atd functionality directly in crond. This qualifier brought to
you by the bureau of auctorial honesty. This article will cover atd
and crond as they are distributed with most currently sold
distributions, including Debian 2.1, Red Hat, SuSE and Corel, among
others.) My test cases were all carried out on a Red Hat 6.1
installation using version 3.1.7 of at. Debian and SuSE versions I
currently have are at 3.1.8.
</p><p>As for cron, most Linux distributions use &ldquo;Vixie cron&rdquo;
which was originally written, as you might guess, by Paul Vixie.
The distributions have each done their own fixes to address a
security hole discovered in August 1999. Check your distribution's
update page for the most recent version of cron, and make sure you
have it installed.</p><p>What you think about at and cron will largely depend on what
your background is. If you are familiar with only the DOS and
Windows world, you should be fairly impressed with what atd and
crond offer, even if you have made use of the System Agent, which
has certain similarities to crond. If you are an old hand from the
world of MIS where you had JCL and various batch environment
control systems, you will probably find atd and crond lacking in
some essential features. Even so, I hope you will come away from
this introduction with a healthy appreciation for what these tools
do offer, and perhaps a few ideas about how, even with their
limitations, they significantly enhance Linux's
capabilities.</p><p>People with a mainframe background are very familiar with the
concept of job scheduling. They usually use this term
interchangably with batch processing. Alas, job scheduling is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> batch processing. Batch processing, to my
mind at least, includes the concepts of job dependencies, batch
process monitoring, checkpoint/restart and recoverability. Neither
atd nor crond provides these facilities. If you come from the world
of big iron, you may be feeling some disappointment. Don't. As you
will see, atd and crond fit in well with the overall UNIX
philosophy of simple tools that do one thing well.</p><p>If you are coming from a Windows/DOS perspective, you should
be pleased by the multi-user nature of atd and crond. Unlike System
Agent, you do not have to be logged in for your jobs to be carried
out.</p><p>If you have a UNIX background, well, you are amongst old
friends here.</p><p>For those totally unfamiliar with these concepts, what we are
talking about is running programs. So what, you say? I log in and
type commands and click on little icons. I run programs all day.
What's the big deal?</p><p>What about having programs run at a certain time of the day,
whether you are there or not? What about compiling the latest
version of WINE on a busy Linux server when it won't slow down the
branch office Intranet? What about that annoying log file the
on-line order application spits out that is about to eat up all the
free disk space on /usr/prod/orders?</p><p>This is where job scheduling comes into play.</p><p>There are two kinds of scheduled jobs. You can think of them
as &ldquo;one shot&rdquo; and &ldquo;repeating&rdquo;. One-shot jobs are single
executions of programs you want to have take place at some future
time, whether or not you are logged in. Repeating jobs are programs
you want to have run at certain times or dates, over and over
again.</p><p>The command you use to schedule one-shot jobs is called
&ldquo;at&rdquo;. The way to schedule repeating jobs is through a &ldquo;crontab&rdquo;
(which is a portmanteau word made from CRON TABle, similar to
INITtialization TABle and other *nix-y portmanteau words). Oddly
enough, the command used to view, edit and store crontabs is called
&ldquo;crontab&rdquo;.</p><p>Unlike some of the other d&aelig;mons we have covered in this
series, these two have interactive user programs that control them.
Because of this, we will cover the basics of using these two
d&aelig;mons as a non-privileged user (I hope you aren't logging in
to your Linux system as root!), then we will go over the
d&aelig;mons and how they work, then we will cover some fine points
of &ldquo;non-user&rdquo; or system-scheduled jobs, and finally some of the
little &ldquo;gotchas&rdquo; that sometimes cause commands to behave
differently than you expect when you run them through a
scheduler.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f0580.0x1ae8c90"></a>Using at</h2></div></div><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>at</b></span> command is used to
schedule one or more programs for a single execution at some later
time. There are actually four client commands:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>at: Runs commands at specified time</p></li><li><p>atq: Lists pending commands</p></li><li><p>atrm: Cancels pending jobs</p></li><li><p>batch: Runs commands when system load
permits</p></li></ol></div><p>The Linux <span   class="bold"><b>at</b></span> command accepts
a number of time specifications, considerably extending the POSIX.2
standard. These include:
<pre     class="programlisting">
HH:MM
</pre>


Run at this hour and minute. If this is already passed, the next
day is assumed. A 24-hour time is assumed, unless you suffix the
time with &ldquo;am&rdquo; or &ldquo;pm&rdquo;.
<pre     class="programlisting">
now noon midnight teatime
</pre>


You read that right. You can type &ldquo;at teatime&rdquo;, and Linux's
<span   class="bold"><b>at</b></span> is civilized enough to know
that this is 4 p.m. local time. The &ldquo;noon&rdquo; and &ldquo;midnight&rdquo;
keywords have their normal meaning. The &ldquo;now&rdquo; keyword means what
it says. It might seem like a dumb thing to have, since if you
wanted to run something now, you would type it without the
<span   class="bold"><b>at</b></span> command, but it has an
application in &ldquo;relative time&rdquo; invocations. We'll see those after
the date modifiers described below.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f0580.0x1ae9318"></a>Date Modifiers</h2></div></div><p>These time specifications may be optionally followed by a
date specification. Date specifications come in a number of forms,
including:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
today tomorrow
</pre><p>These mean what you would expect. &ldquo;at teatime tomorrow&rdquo;
will run the commands at 4 p.m. the following day. Note that if you
specify a time already passed (as in &ldquo;at noon today&rdquo; when it is 3
p.m.), the job will be run at once. You do not get an error. At
first you might think this a bad thing, but look at it this way.
What if the system had been down since 10 a.m. and was only being
restarted now at 3 p.m.? Would you want a critical job skipped, or
would you want it to run as soon as possible? The at system takes
the conservative view and assumes you will want the job run.
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;month_name&gt; &lt;day&gt; [&lt;year&gt;]
</pre>


where month_name is &ldquo;jan&rdquo; or &ldquo;feb&rdquo;, etc., and day is a day
number. The year is optional, and should be a four-digit year, of
course.
<pre     class="programlisting">
MM/DD/YYYY YYYY-MM-DD
</pre>


Don't listen to what the &ldquo;man at&rdquo; page tells you! At least in Red
Hat 6.1, it is wrong! I suspect it is wrong in certain other
releases as well, and I'm willing to bet this is because the
documentation has not caught up with Y2K fixes to this subsystem.
The at shipped with Red Hat 6.1 handles dates in the two formats
above. It appears to handle 2-digit years correctly, turning values
less than 50 into 20xx and those greater than 50 into 19xx. I did
not test to find the exact pivot point, and I do not recommend that
you bother to, either. If you use two-digit years at this point, be
prepared to pay a price! Depending on your version of at to treat
two-digit years a certain way is foolish. Use four-digit years.
Haven't we learned our lesson? (If you worked with computers from
1995 to 1999, you felt the pain as work came to an almost complete
halt while we pored over every system with microscopes, looking for
date flaws in the designs of our systems. Don't make a Y2.1K
problem! PLEASE!!!)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f0580.0x1ae9580"></a>Relative Time</h2></div></div><p>Another way you can modify a time specification is to apply a
relative time to it. The format of a relative time specification is
<b  >+ &lt;count&gt; &lt;time units&gt;</b>, where
&ldquo;count&rdquo; is simply a number and &ldquo;time units&rdquo; is one of
&ldquo;minutes&rdquo;, &ldquo;hours&rdquo;, &ldquo;days&rdquo; or &ldquo;weeks&rdquo;.</p><p>So, you can say:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
at 7pm + 2 weeks
</pre><p>and the programs will be scheduled for two weeks from today
at 7 p.m. local time.
</p><p>One of the most common forms is this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
at now + x units
</pre><p>to specify a program or programs to be run so many units from
now. Something I often use this for is in shutting down my home
machine's dial-up connection from work. I dial in before I leave
for work, and then I kill it before my wife gets home (I'm too
cheap to buy a second line). I use ssh to log in from work, and I
like to close all my windows cleanly, so I frequently do something
like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# ps fax | grep wvdial
  599 ?        S      0:00      \_ wvdial
  875 pts/2    S      0:00      \_ grep wvdial
# at now + 10 minutes
at&gt; kill 599
at&gt;
warning: commands will be executed using /bin/sh
job 9 at 2000-04-17 16:30
# exit
$ exit
</pre>


I then have ten minutes to disconnect cleanly from my home system
before my phone connection gets dropped.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f0580.0x1ae9948"></a>Runtime Environment</h2></div></div><p>Note that the plain old Bourne shell is used for all commands
run by at. (Also note: I had to type ctrl-d, the *nix EOF character
to close the interactive at session. More on this in the section on
the at command line. This is just one factor affecting the behavior
of at scheduled commands. Here are some other facts to bear in
mind. The present working directory, environment variables (with
three exceptions, see below), the current userid and the umask that
were in effect when the at command was issued are retained and will
be used when the commands are executed. The three environment
variable exceptions are <b  >TERM</b>,
<b  >DISPLAY</b> and &ldquo;_&rdquo; (which usually contains the
last command executed in the shell). The output of the commands is
mailed to the user who issued the at command. If the
<span   class="bold"><b>at</b></span> command is issued in an
<span   class="bold"><b>su</b></span> shell (meaning, if you
&ldquo;became&rdquo; another user), the output mail will be sent to the login
user, but the programs will run under the su user.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f0580.0x1ae9bb0"></a>Permission</h2></div></div><p>The ability to use <span   class="bold"><b>at</b></span> is
controlled by two files: /etc/at.deny and /etc/at.allow.</p><p>The /etc/at.allow file is checked first. If it exists, only
user names in this file are allowed to run at. If the /etc/at.allow
file does not exist, then the /etc/at.deny file is checked. All
user names <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> mentioned in that file may run
at.</p><p>If neither file exists, only the superuser may run at.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f0580.0x1ee2068"></a>Command Line</h2></div></div><p>The at command runs either the commands passed on standard
input (passed in through a pipe, or typed at the &ldquo;at&gt;&rdquo; prompts
as in the example above), or it runs the commands specified in the
file named by the <b  >-f</b> parameter.</p><p>The general form of the at command line is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
at [-V] [-q &lt;queue&gt;] [-f &lt;file&gt;] [-mld] &lt;TIME&gt;
</pre><p>where &ldquo;queue&rdquo; is a queue name. Queue names are letters, a-z
or A-Z. See the section called &ldquo;Queues&rdquo; for more details.
</p><p>&ldquo;file&rdquo; is the name of a file containing commands to
run.</p><p>&ldquo;TIME&rdquo; is a time specification as discussed in detail
above.</p><p>The remaining switches are -m (send mail to the user when the
job is complete, even if no output was produced); -l (an alias for
<span   class="bold"><b>atq</b></span>. See the atq section below);
-d (an alias for <span   class="bold"><b>atrm</b></span>. See the
atrm section below).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f0580.0x1ee2488"></a>The atq Command</h2></div></div><p>The atq command lists jobs queued by the current user (unless
run as superuser, in which case pending jobs for all users are
listed).</p><p>Here's a sample:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mars:20:~$ atq
5       2000-06-20 15:00 a
6       2000-07-04 15:00 a
10      2000-04-24 14:33 f
mars:21:~$
</pre><p>The first column is the job number, followed by the scheduled
run time, followed by the queue. In this case, two jobs are in
queue &ldquo;a&rdquo; and one in queue &ldquo;f&rdquo;. See the section on queues for
more information.
</p><p>You can use the <b  >-q</b> switch to look at jobs
only in a particular queue.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f0580.0x1ee2748"></a>The atrm Command</h2></div></div><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>atrm</b></span> command is used to
delete jobs from the atq. For example, consider the queue in the
atq example above. The following session illustrates the use of
atrm:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mars:21:~$ atrm 6
mars:22:~$ atq
5       2000-06-20 15:00 a
10      2000-04-24 14:33 f
mars:23:~$
</pre><p>You may list any number of job numbers on the command line.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f0580.0x1ee2958"></a>The batch command</h2></div></div><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>batch</b></span> command is a
variation of <span   class="bold"><b>at</b></span> that, rather than
scheduling a job for a time in the future, submits a job now, but
that job will not start until the system's load average falls below
0.8. What is load average? The simplest way to think of it is the
number of processes that are waiting to run. Most of the time,
programs are idle, waiting for hardware or for input, or waiting
for the kernel to complete a request. When a program actually has
something to do, it is in a runnable state. If the system is not
busy, the kernel generally gives control to such a program right
away. When some other program is in the middle of running, the
program that has just become runnable must wait. The instantaneous
system load is the number of runnable processes that are not
running. The load average is an average of this instantaneous load
over a short period of time. Thus, a system that is below 1.0 load
average has some idle time. A system that is at and hovers near 1.0
is fully busy, and at theoretical maximum capacity. A system that
is over 1.0 has no idle time, and processes are waiting for a
chance to run. Note that this does not necessarily mean the system
becomes perceptibly slower to users, but it does mean the maximum
capacity of the system has been reached and programs are running
slower than they might on a less busy system.</p><p>The batch command schedules a job for &ldquo;right now&rdquo;, but will
delay the start of the job until there is idle time (load average
less than 0.8) on the system. Note that this test is for starting
the job. Once it is started, it will run to completion, no matter
how busy the system becomes during the run.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f0580.0x1ee2b68"></a>Queues</h2></div></div><p>Note that this section is quite Linux-specific. Other UNIX
operating systems I have used have queues, but they are different
from those documented here. Always consult local documentation. AIX
doesn't work this way, for example.</p><p>Queues are a way of grouping jobs together in separate lists.
They are named from a-z and A-Z. The at command by default puts
jobs on queue &ldquo;a&rdquo;, whereas the
<span   class="bold"><b>batch</b></span> puts jobs on queue &ldquo;b&rdquo; by
default.</p><p>Queue names with &ldquo;greater&rdquo; values run at higher
&ldquo;niceness&rdquo;. Nice values are a way that Linux (and other UNIX
systems) set job priorities. The default nice level of a job is
&ldquo;0&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;normal&rdquo;. Jobs can have nice values from -20
(highest possible priority) to +19 (lowest possible priority). Only
the superuser can give jobs a negative nice value. We won't say
anymore about nice here, as a discussion of the kernel scheduler is
well beyond our scope. Just know that jobs in the &ldquo;z&rdquo; queue run
at a lower priority (and thus slower and with less impact on other
running jobs) than do jobs in the &ldquo;a&rdquo; queue.</p><p>Jobs that are running will be in the &ldquo;=&rdquo; queue, which is
reserved for running jobs.</p><p>Queue names are case sensitive! Rembember, there are a-z
queues and A-Z queues. The A-Z queues are special. If you use at to
put a job on a queue with a capital letter, then the job is treated
as if it were submitted to the
<span   class="bold"><b>batch</b></span> command at the run time
instead of the <span   class="bold"><b>at</b></span> command.</p><p>In other words, putting a job on an uppercase queue is like
combining at and batch. When the job runs, it runs immediately if
the load average is below 0.8, otherwise it waits until the load
average falls below that point. In no case will the job start
before its scheduled time.</p><p>Phew! All of that and we still haven't looked at the
d&aelig;mon that takes care of all this! I hope you are beginning
to see that &ldquo;at&rdquo;, while not a complete batch processing system,
certainly provides a great deal of capability.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f0580.0x1ee2f88"></a>How They Work</h2></div></div><p>The at and batch commands put jobs into the at queue. What is
the at queue? Well, there is a directory, /var/spool/at, which is
accessible only to the d&aelig;mon user and the superuser
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span> is available to the superuser).
For each job, there is a file in the directory. The file is a shell
script that sets up the environment and umask, cd's to the working
directory and then runs the programs specified to at/batch in
succession.</p><p>The commands go into the shell script exactly as they were
typed/piped to at. Each is run in turn. If you used
<b  >&amp;</b>, <b  >&amp;&amp;</b> or
<b  >;</b> to background jobs, or make jobs dependent on
one another, these will be observed.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Important note</b></span>! The shell
/bin/sh is used to run these jobs. If you normally use some other
shell, such as tcsh, be aware that you can't use the semantics of
that shell because /bin/sh will be used instead.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f0580.0x1ee32f8"></a>The atd D&aelig;mon</h2></div></div><p>At this point, documenting the d&aelig;mon is rather
anticlimactic. The atd d&aelig;mon examines the /var/spool/at
directory. The names of the files actually encode their runtimes,
queues and batch vs. at status. These files are shell scripts that
set up the environment and run the job as described above. Output
from the jobs is temporarily stored in /var/spool/at/spool until
the jobs are completed, upon which the output is mailed to the
invoking user.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f0580.0x1ee3400"></a>At Summary</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>at</b></span> is less widely known than
cron, but is in many ways the more powerful tool.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f0580.0x1ee3560"></a>Using crontab</h2></div></div><p>Potentially every user on the system has a
<span   class="bold"><b>crontab</b></span>, which is a portmanteau
word made from CRON TABle. The command to create, examine and
modify crontabs is called crontab.</p><p>There are four ways to invoke crontab.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
crontab &lt;file&gt;
crontab -l
crontab -r
crontab -e
</pre><p>Generally, crontab works on your own crontab. All four forms
accept the -u option followed by a user name. In most cases, you
will be able to view and edit other users' crontabs only if you are
the superuser. You might want to check your system security if you
are able to edit another user's crontabs. You probably have some
problems!
</p><p>The first form stores the named file as the crontab,
replacing any current crontab. The second form dumps the current
crontab to stdout. The third form removes the current crontab. The
fourth form opens the current crontab in the editor specified by
the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variable.</p><p>If you want to experiment with your crontab, it's a good idea
to do a</p><pre     class="programlisting">
crontab -l working-crontab
</pre><p>to save your current crontab if any, then use
<pre     class="programlisting">
crontab -e
</pre>


to modify your crontab in your favorite editor. you can always use
<pre     class="programlisting">
crontab -r working-crontab
</pre>


to put everything back the way it was.
</p><p>At this point, you may be wondering what a crontab looks like
and what it does.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f0580.0x1ee3a30"></a>Basic crontab Format</h2></div></div><p>A crontab is a list of program command lines along with a
specification of when to run that command line. It is a
whitespace-delimited file with a newline between commands. Blank
lines and lines beginning with a pound character (#) are
ignored.</p><p>The fields are:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
minute  hour   day of month    month    day of week    command
</pre><p>Any of the time fields may be an asterisk (*), which means
&ldquo;every&rdquo;. Thus, an entry of:
<pre     class="programlisting">
* * * * * fetchmail
</pre>


Will run fetchmail once a minute, every minute of every hour, every
day.
</p><p>Ranges of numbers are allowed. So:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p>will run fetchmail once a minute, between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.,
Monday through Friday (0 or 7 represents Sunday).
</p><p>Lists are allowed. Thus:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
0,20,40 * * * 1-5 fetchmail
</pre><p>will run fetchmail at the hour, at 20 past, and again at 40
past the hour every hour of the day, Monday through Friday.
</p><p>Step values are allowed after asterisks and ranges. They are
of the form &lt;range&gt;/&lt;step&gt;. So,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
*/5 8-17/2 * * * cp /var/log/* /log/backup
</pre><p>will run that cp command (just in case you had started
thinking you could run only fetchmail) every five minutes in the 8
a.m., 10 a.m., noon, 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. hours of every day.
</p><p>Finally, names may be used for months (jan-dec, case
insensitive) and days of the week (sun-sat, case insensitive). The
Red Hat man pages claim that you can't use names in ranges, but I
gave it a try myself and it appeared to work correctly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f0580.0x1ee4008"></a>Runtime Environment&mdash;Advanced crontab
Format</h2></div></div><p>This is the area that confuses users of cron the most. They
specify commands they run every day from their interactive shells,
and then they put them in their crontab and they don't work or they
behave differently than they expected.</p><p>For example, if you write a program called &ldquo;fardels&rdquo; and
put it in &amp;HOME/bin, then add $HOME/bin to your PATH, cron
might send you mail like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/bin/sh: fardels: command not found
</pre><p>The PATH cron uses is not necessarily the same as the one
your interactive shell uses.
</p><p>It is necessary to understand that the environment in which
cron jobs run is <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the environment in which
they operate every day.</p><p>First of all, none of their normal environment variables are
initialized as they are in their login shells. The following
environment variables are set up by the cron d&aelig;mon:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
SHELL=/bin/sh
LOGNAME  set from /etc/passwd entry for the crontab's UID.
HOME  set from /etc/passwd entry for the crontab's UID.
</pre><p>We've been holding out on you. There's another kind of entry
allowed in your crontab file. Lines of the form
i<b  >name=value</b> are allowed to set environment
variables that will be set when jobs are run out of the crontab.
You may set any environment variable except
<b  >LOGNAME</b>.
</p><p>An important one to note is <b  >MAILTO</b>. If
<b  >MAILTO</b> is undefined, the output of jobs will be
mailed to the user who owns the crontab. If
<b  >MAILTO</b> is defined but empty, mailed output is
suppressed. Otherwise, you may specify an e-mail address to which
to send the output of cron jobs.</p><p>Finally, any percent sign in the command portion of a job
entry is treated as a newline. Any data which follows the first
percent sign is passed to the job as standard input, so you can use
this to invoke an interactive program on a scheduled basis.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f0580.0x2071bb8"></a>Permissions</h2></div></div><p>The ability to have and use a crontab is controlled in a
manner very similar to the <span   class="bold"><b>at</b></span>
subsystem. Two files, /etc/cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny, determine
who can use crontab. Just as in the case of at, the cron.allow is
checked first. If it exists, only the users listed there may have
cron jobs. If it does not exist, the cron.deny file is read. All
users except those listed there may have cron jobs.</p><p>If neither file exists (and this is quite unlike &ldquo;at&rdquo;), all
users may have crontabs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f0580.0x2071d70"></a>The cron D&aelig;mon</h2></div></div><p>There is hardly anything to document here. The cron
d&aelig;mon (which is called either cron or crond) takes no
arguments and does not respond to any signals in a special way. It
examines the /var/spool/cron directory at start-up for files with
names matching user names in /etc/passwd. These files are read into
memory. Once per minute, cron wakes up and walks through its list
of jobs, executing any that are scheduled for that minute.</p><p>Each minute, it also checks to see if the /var/spool/cron
directory has changed since it was last read, and it rereads any
modifications, thus updating the schedule automatically.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f0580.0x2071ed0"></a>System crontab</h2></div></div><p>I've led you through a merry dance so far. I've got you
thinking that only users have crontabs, and that all scheduled jobs
run as the crontab's owning user. That's almost true. Cron also has
a way to specify crontabs at a &ldquo;system&rdquo; level. In addition to
checking /var/spool/cron, the cron d&aelig;mon also looks for an
/etc/crontab and an /etc/cron.d directory.</p><p>The /etc/crontab file and the files in /etc/cron.d are
&ldquo;system crontabs&rdquo;. These have a slightly different format from
that discussed so far.</p><p>The key difference is the insertion of a field between the
&ldquo;day of week&rdquo; field and the command field. This field is &ldquo;run as
user&rdquo; field. Thus:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
02 4 * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.daily
</pre><p>will run &ldquo;run-parts /etc/cron.daily&rdquo; as root at 2 minutes
past 4 a.m. every single day.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f0580.0x2072138"></a>Final Notes</h2></div></div><p>There you have it. While Linux does not ship with a mature
and complete batch process management tool, still the combination
of at and cron permit considerable flexibility and power.</p><p>Bear in mind that we have covered the Linux versions of these
tools as shipped with most current distributions. While just about
every UNIX system on the market has these tools, some things
vary.</p><p>Expect at queues to be different. Not all crons support names
or ranges. Most do not support lists of ranges or the increment
feature. No other cron with which I am familiar supports setting
environment variables in the crontab. I don't think any other
<span   class="bold"><b>at</b></span> supports &ldquo;teatime&rdquo; as a time
specification.</p><p>This boils down to a basic piece of advice. Always check the
local documentation. If in doubt, experiment.</p><p><a href="4087s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
