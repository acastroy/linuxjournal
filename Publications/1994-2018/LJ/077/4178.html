tried to find this everywhere, with no success.  &mdash;Bryan Hepkema,
bhepkema@blsc.com</p><p>If I get your question correctly, to generate an exact copy
of what is on a floppy disk, and store it on your hard disk, you
can use the command <b  >dd if=/dev/floppy
of=/tmp/floppy_image</b>. You may have to input the correct
device name for your floppy unit (possibly /dev/fd0). This will
create a binary image of whatever is on the diskette in the file
/temp/floppy_image. I would suggest you study the dd command with
man (man dd).  &mdash;Felipe E. Barousse Bou&eacute;, fbarousse@piensa.com</p><p>If you need an image from a file, just insert the floppy and
<b  >cat /dev/fd0 &gt; file</b>. The device representing
the floppy is just a file representing the whole disk. That's true
for hard drives as well.  &mdash;Alessandro Rubini, rubini@linux.it</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b7580.0x23af348"></a>Web Fonts and Printing</h2></div></div><p>How do I get Netscape to print fonts like the web pages

load and use True-Type fonts?  &mdash;Greg Crutcher,
madcrutch@earthlink.net</p><p>There is no short answer to your question. Many Xwindows
configuration issues have to be addressed. The right answers can be
found at the following URL:

It is also worth mentioning that Netscape has its own personality
regarding fonts and behavior under X.  &mdash;Felipe E. Barousse Bou&eacute;,

Pavillion 6630 computer. I can dual boot into either Linux or Win
98 and would like to be able to share files between operating
systems. Under Linux, the file directory for Windows is visible
under hda, and I browse through my Windows files and even open
them, but I cannot write to this directory. Is there any easy way
to set up a location on the hard drive where I can read and write
to files from either Linux or Windows?  &mdash;Tom Newman,
newmanth@usa.net</p><p>It looks like you don't have permission to write to the
files. That's what I would expect if you work as a user and the
directory is automatically mounted at boot. Try adding &ldquo;umask=0&rdquo;
in /etc/fstab, in the field where &ldquo;default&rdquo; appears to allow
everybody to write the files. To have it be effective immediately,
try <b  >umount /dos; mount /dos</b>.  &mdash;Alessandro Rubini,
rubini@linux.it</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b7580.0x23af768"></a>PostgreSQL on Boot</h2></div></div><p>How can I have PostgreSQL start automatically when my
computer boots up? I must start the postgreSQL server with the
command <b  >nohup postmaster -d 2 &gt; logfile 2&gt;&amp;1
&amp;</b>, and I must start it as the user &ldquo;postgres&rdquo;. I
can't figure out where in the /etc/rc.d scripts I should start it
from. Thanks for your help!  &mdash;Warren Killian, warrenk@in.net</p><p>The best way to start new programs is by writing a new
script, just for them, in /etc/rc.d/init.d (talking RH-hierarchy,
other distributions may be slightly different in the pathnames) and
then link it from /etc/rc.d/rc3.d. The instructions to write those
scripts in the right way should be part of the documentation for
your distribution; another good way to do things is to learn (and
copy) from what other scripts do. As far as links in
/etc/rc.d/rc*.d, there is also a graphic tool to make those links,
part of the control-panel tool. Note that Debian is already
packaging Postres, so you can look at that script as
well.  &mdash;Alessandro Rubini, rubini@linux.it</p><p>The script should use a syntax such as</p><pre     class="programlisting">
su postgres -c '/usr/bin/postmaster ...'
</pre><p>However, a &ldquo;postgresql&rdquo; init script is included
in the distribution so that it is installed in the /etc/rc.d/inid.d
directory.  &mdash;Pierre Ficheux, pficheux@com1.fr

when I boot to Linux, the login screen flashes and accepts
characters only when the screen is displayed (at about half-second
intervals, on and off). I cannot catch the on part in order to
successfully log in. What is wrong, and how is it fixed? I tried
typing kde at the command prompt, but it cannot load x. It runs
okay in VGA mode and logs in to kde okay. I am a total Linux newbie
but am familiar with MS-DOS and CP/M (showing my age now!) Many
thanks.  &mdash;Adam Puk, adam-puk@cwcom.net</p><p>Your symptoms may mean that the system is driving the screen
at incorrect frequencies (the PC world is too varied; it's not easy
at all to devise things that work for all possible hardware), but
there should be no relationship between that and reaction to
keboard input. What you may try is booting in single user and then
look for the command that corrupts things by executing the init
scripts one at a time. Unfortunately, to do this kind of tracing,
you'd need to already have good experience. I'm afraid your best
bet is to look for a knowleadgeble neighbor.  &mdash;Alessandro Rubini,
rubini@linux.it</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b7580.0x23afb88"></a>Cannot Access the Web</h2></div></div><p>I am trying to make the system run on my cable modem. I have
two other computers running on it, but they are Windows-operated. I
have entered all the information that is needed, IP, Gateway,
subnet mask, as well as host and domain. But every time I try to
run Netscape and go to a web page, it gives me an error message
that the web server cannot be found. I cannot seem to figure out
what the problem might be; I have tried to follow all the
documentation I could get my hands on. Hopefully you can help
me.  &mdash;Chirag Jay Patel, cjpagni@home.com</p><p>It looks like you have a routing problem. Try this
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
route add default gw &lt;ip_of_your_cable_modem_host&gt;
</pre><p>That is the IP address of the host that has
attached the cable modem (or the IP address of the modem itself,
depending on your hardware setup). What happens here is that this
command tells Linux's TCP/IP to go out through the standard and
default exit to the Internet, which is your cable modem.  &mdash;Felipe E.

is no connection. In /var/log/messages, there is the nex message:
Peer is not authorized to use remote address x.x.x.x Where x.x.x.x
is het number from the ISP. I searched the Internet for this but
got very little information. Thank you in advance.  &mdash;Wim van den
Broeke, w.vd.broeke@hccnet.nl</p><p>Try adding the line</p><pre     class="programlisting">
noauth
</pre><p>to the /etc/ppp/options file so the peer is allowed
to set the route from the ISP assigned address, which is assumed
not to be set at the moment of connection. Do a man pppd and check
all options for the pppd daemon on the &ldquo;options&rdquo; setup
file.  &mdash;Felipe E. Barousse Bou&eacute;, fbarousse@piensa.com

how to do the following:1. Set the desktop display to conform to
the monitor. 2. Set up the screen to be able to fit the size of my
monitor. 3. Change the color scoop from 16bit to more colors.
(Still monitor) 4. I am confused about Samba. Please advise on how
to connect Samba file share with Windows.  &mdash;Luke,
godmatrix@godmatrix.com</p><p>1. The Xconfigurator command will guide you on the X setup.
Use &ldquo;custom&rdquo; monitor and get the correct values of scan
frequencies from your monitor manual specs.</p><p>2. The highest resolution can be achieved with Xconfigurator,
as well. Make sure your monitor supports high resolutions!</p><p>3. After Xconfigurator, you can try editing
/etc/X11/XF86Config to define default video modes, let's say
800x600 or 1024x768 on your video card's settings section. You have
to make sure you have enough video memory to support high color
depths.</p><p>4. You need to set up the IP and host name of your Windows PC
on /etc/hosts. That is, host names must be correctly resolved. Edit
/etc/smb.conf and add your workgroup name to the line: workgroup =
YOUR_WORKGROUP_NAME. Then, add the server name to the line: server
string = YOUR_SAMBA_SERVER_NAME. Finally, edit the line to say
hosts allow = xxx.yyy.xxx. 127. You must write the first three
number groups of your IP addresses (denoting the LAN address
itself) immediately after a blank space and the &ldquo;127.&rdquo;,
indicating the localhost. Note the trailing dots after network and
localhost-network IP numbers. Lastly, share a directory from Linux
to Windows, let's say:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[linuxtemp]
   comment = Linux /tmp directory
   path = /tmp
   public = yes
   writable = yes
   printable = no
</pre><p>This will share the /tmp directory under the
&ldquo;linuxtemp&rdquo; name. Restart Samba with the command
/etc/rc.d/init.d/smb restart and double click on the network
neighborhood of your Windows box; you should see the Linux's share
/tmp directory.
</p><p>Samba is a complex service. I would suggest you look up
further details from the Linux documentation project site at
