    Phil writes about editorial changes.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xda3580.0xe9b2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>I expect most of you will already know
this from our web announcements, but just to make it official in
print, Marjorie Richardson has left <i  >Linux Journal</i>. Margie worked as Managing Editor and then
Editor in Chief of <i  >LJ</i> since 1997. Her efforts
helped us grow, and she will be missed.
</p><p>I have decided to take this opportunity to make some changes
to hone our editorial staff. First, I have done a little
re-organization. Rather than have all the responsibility for the
content of <i  >LJ</i> articles fall on one person, I
have divided it among three people. While Doc Searls has been
responsible for the upFRONT section content and business-related
articles, we now make that official.</p><p>The other two positions are Technical Editor and Editor at
Large. Our <span   class="emphasis"><em>new</em></span> technical editor takes over
responsibility for the technical articles that appear in
<i  >LJ</i>. This is intended to assure that technical
quality is upheld and consistent and that it addresses the
interests of <i  >LJ</i> readers.</p><p>The Editor at Large will be the frontman&mdash;okay,
front-<span   class="emphasis"><em>person</em></span>--for the editorial team. This
person will work with authors to get articles that fit our
editorial direction and be the first-line editorial contact for
vendors as well as readers.</p><p>To make this all go together, we need an <span   class="emphasis"><em>inside
person</em></span> who understands how we put
<i  >LJ</i> together. That person is Darcy Whitman.
Darcy has been with <i  >LJ</i> for five years and in
the editorial department for the last year. She has proven herself
in her ability to organize, and most importantly, she loves vi. So,
please welcome Darcy as our new Managing Editor.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xda3580.0xe9b8c8"></a>What New Technical Editor?</h2></div></div><p>On June 26, Don Marti joined us as Senior Technical Editor.
Don Marti is best known for his influential role as Publicity
Director of the Silicon Valley Linux Users Group, which currently
boasts over 450 members, and also for his outstanding support of
the Linux community. We are very excited to have Don Marti join our
dynamic team. He's been a part of the Linux movement from the
beginning, and has made a tremendous contribution to the community
as a whole. I am confident in his talent and leadership ability to
ensure <i  >Linux Journal</i> continues to be at the
forefront of the Linux revolution.</p><p>When we asked him about his new position at <i  >Linux Journal</i>, he replied, &ldquo;I've been a <i  >Linux Journal</i> subscriber almost since the beginning, and it's
always been one of my favorite sources for Linux news and technical
information. I'm looking forward to helping put together future
issues of a magazine that I really like to read.&rdquo;</p><p>As I write this, we are still evaluating candidates for the
Editor at Large position. It is important that we find the right
person who has publishing experience and also groks the Linux
community.</p><p>Until this person is in place, Laurie Tucker, long-time
Special Projects person with <i  >LJ</i>, and I will be
filling in as needed. In addition, Heather Mead, who originally
joined the company in a marketing position and then moved to
Circulation Manager, is transitioning to an Associate Editor
position. Heather's fine English skills will be a big plus for the
editorial team.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xda3580.0xe9bc38"></a>Call for Linux Activism</h2></div></div><p>The most-requested program in the Publishing category of our
Software Wish List  is
FrameMaker, the document layout program from Adobe. Adobe listened,
and there has been a beta release out for some time. Now beta 2 is
out, and it seems pretty clean and stable. I gave it a test drive
and am really impressed with its speed and ease of use. I was even
surprised it would import troff documents.</p><p>Now it's your turn. If you have any interest in a program
like FrameMaker, grab it from the Adobe site
(<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/tryadobe" target="_self">http://www.adobe.com/products/tryadobe/</a>),
give it a try and let Adobe know what you think.</p><p>A second activism item is SETI, the Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence. This UC Berkeley project lets people
with PCs help analyze data. The good news is that PCs include
Linux. You can go to
<a href="http://www.setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu" target="_self">www.setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu</a>
for general information, or directly to our group from the
<a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/team_list.html" target="_self">setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/team_list.html</a>
page and enter &ldquo;<i  >Linux Journal</i>&rdquo; in the search box. Come join us
and increase the visibility of Linux and <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p><a href="4182s1.html" target="_self">CALL FOR AUTHORS</a></p></div></div>
