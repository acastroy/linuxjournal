    In order to allow the acquisition of diagnostic data from an existing
    industrial plant which was not designed for the purpose, a protocol
    converter gateway has been built by using an industrial PC running
    Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b5f580.0x1c57500"></a></h2></div></div><p>A big turbocompressor in an oil
extraction plant is controlled by a 15-year-old Digital Control
System (DCS), which provides all the supervision functions, plus
the logging of significant events and data onto a printer. The
system has been running satisfactorily for years, but now the
management would like to integrate the machine into the global
plant SCADA system, where data from various machines are gathered
and processed in order to provide integrated management of the
entire plant.
</p><p>The PLC-based architecture of the existing DCS is hardly
expandable and doesn't allow, from either the hardware or software
point of view, for the addition of the data transmission functions
which would be necessary for the project. A redesign of the DCS
system to add the required functionalities was considered an
excessively high-impact solution for the purpose.</p><p>The solution proposed was thus to add to the existing DCS a
sort of &ldquo;protocol converter gateway&rdquo;, i.e., a box which captures
the printer data stream, analyzes the lines of text to extract data
values and makes them available to the SCADA (see sidebar) system.
The latter will periodically issue data queries to receive the data
values from the gateway. For this part of the connection, the
standard protocol Modbus RTU was selected because of its simplicity
and because it was already widely used throughout the plant.</p><p><a href="4140s1.html" target="_self">Definitions of Terms</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b5f580.0x1c57768"></a>System Architecture</h2></div></div><p>From the hardware point of view, what is needed is a box with
two serial ports: one to receive the printer data stream from the
DCS and the other to receive data queries from the SCADA system.
The box must run some program which decodes the printer data stream
and replies to the SCADA queries.</p><p>The main challenge in this kind of application is represented
by the particular environment: the plant is located in a
geographically remote area and the site has all the problems which
are usually found in industrial environments&mdash;dust, electrical
noise, wide ambient temperature ranges, and so on. Industrial PCs
are easily available on the market, but one must take into account
a few peculiarities which are usually not found in other
PCs:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>There is no fan on the CPU. Spinning parts are the
weak points in a PC and the miniaturized CPU fan is particularly
unreliable with time. The main fan cannot be easily avoided, and is
accompanied by suitable filters. We can do without the CPU fan,
provided that the clock speed is reduced to limit the heat
dissipation needs.</p></li><li><p>There are no disks. The hard disk is substituted by
a solid state &ldquo;Flash EPROM disk&rdquo;. The floppy disk drive may be
included, but it will be used only for software uploading. This
means that the available disk space is very limited, usually not
more than 64MB, but in our case, just 8MB.</p></li><li><p>Standard RS-232 lines are not suitable for serial
data transmission in &ldquo;noisy&rdquo; environments. The more reliable
RS-485 standard is usually adopted.</p></li><li><p>The PC will usually run without keyboard or
display. They can be reconnected for maintenance needs.</p></li></ul></div><p>As a result of some of the above constraints and due to
working conditions which are typical of embedded applications, the
software must also meet a number of requirements:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>It must work with a small disk space.</p></li><li><p>It must require limited CPU power.</p></li><li><p>It must boot with no need of human
intervention.</p></li><li><p>It must restart smoothly after power off, both
programmed and due to failures.</p></li><li><p>It must cope with untrained personnel.</p></li></ul></div>

From the point of view of the software development, it was clear
that the software which analyzes the print stream had to be written
from scratch, while existing libraries could be used to write the
code needed to implement the Modbus protocol.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b5f580.0x1c58000"></a>Choosing an Operating System</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Why not a real-time O.S.?</em></span> As it should
be clear by the description of the problem given, we are not
challenged by hard, real-time requirements. The limited speed of
the two I/O channels puts an upper limit to the data throughput and
no problem should arise from unpredictable delays in servicing the
two serial lines. This makes it possible to use a comfortable
standard O.S. and rules out any special purpose real-time operating
system as a cost-effective solution.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Why not DOS?</em></span> The problem at hand is
essentially asynchronous in nature. The system must be able both to
swallow the data stream as produced by the DCS printer output and
to reply to queries from the SCADA system, two process which are
not synchronized in any way. DOS is thus clearly not a viable
solution. Although it has the advantage of being very lightweight
and having a small footprint, it would require quite a lot of
low-level programming to solve the problem.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Why not Windows 95/98/NT?</em></span> Microsoft
Windows (especially Windows NT) is gaining consideration in
industrial applications due to the great number of third-party
packages and tools suited to any need, and because it is backed by
a major vendor. However, the hardware characteristics of the target
computer makes it challenging, if not impossible, to tailor a
version of any Windows brand to the limited file space and CPU
power available. Windows CE was not stable or reliable enough to be
worth consideration. Moreover, the peculiar (weak) multitasking
capabilities of Windows would likely make the programming of
concurrent applications slightly more difficult.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Why Linux?</em></span> Managers are usually worried
when they have to make choices which are not &ldquo;industrially
sound&rdquo;. They will have no problems in justifying the choice of a
costly product provided that it is backed by a major vendor and has
a large installed base. This is not (yet) the case of Linux, so to
foster this kind of choice the technical arguments must be
particularly strong. In this case, I believe that the advantages
provided by Linux are superior to many objections.</p><p>The choice of Linux has many pros:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Linux can be tailored to any particular set of
needs down to the level of kernel configuration.</p></li><li><p>Documentation on how to tailor the system is
thorough and easily available.</p></li><li><p>Linux can run from a RAM disk, so the Flash EPROM
disk is used only to bootstrap. In this way the disk can even be
write-protected.</p></li><li><p>Development may be made in the same environment
where the target system will run.</p></li></ul></div><p>It also obviously has some cons:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Finding drivers for non-standard devices may be
difficult or even impossible.</p></li><li><p>Support from vendors may be more difficult.</p></li></ul></div>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b5f580.0x1c588f0"></a>The Gory Details</h2></div></div><p>In this project we needed two non-standard devices, i.e., the
Flash EPROM disk and the RS-485 serial interface. This didn't cause
any problem: the Flash EPROM disk was used as a standard DOS
formatted device and the serial interface replaces the COM ports
and is managed by the standard serial driver.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b5f580.0x1c589f8"></a>Software Architecture</h2></div></div><p>The protocol converter gateway software has a very simple
structure. It consists of two independent processes: a data
swallower and a Modbus server. The data swallower receives printing
lines from the serial port, analyzes the strings, extracts relevant
data and writes the values into a shared memory buffer. The Modbus
server receives queries from the SCADA system according to the
Modbus protocol specification and sends back the requested values,
reading them from the shared memory buffer.</p><p>Two interactive programs have been added for debugging
purposes: a memory dumper which prints out values read from the
shared memory buffer, and a program to write values into the shared
memory. Both programs can, obviously, run concurrently with the
gateway processes.</p><p>All the code is written in C and the shared memory management
was implemented by using the standard System V interprocess
communication API which allows the creation and management of
shared memory segments and provides <span   class="emphasis"><em>semaphores</em></span>
for synchronizing the access to them.</p><p>Due to the very simple structure of the problem,
synchronization was easily implemented by locking access to the
entire shared buffer when doing a memory access. This simple-minded
approach is quite suitable in this case because all the accesses to
memory are performed in chunks and the low speed of the I/O
operations, with respect to memory accesses, ensures that any
process will wait for a memory lock release for relatively short
times.</p><p>As a tool for the constant verification of the proper
functioning of the gateway, a location of the shared-memory buffer
has been reserved for a counter which is incremented anytime the
data swallower process ends a reading cycle. The SCADA system
periodically reads the variable and may thus raise an alarm if the
variable is not incremented after a given period of time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b5f580.0x1c58cb8"></a>System Configuration</h2></div></div><p>Following directions found in the Linux BootDisk-HOWTO, a
small Linux system was built, starting from a standard Red Hat 6.1
installation. This is actually a trial-and-error process in that
one has to find out exactly which files are needed for one's
purposes.</p><p>Even though our Flash EPROM disk provided a comfortable 8MB
of disk space, all the software must be transferred onto the target
computer by floppy disks, thus it is desirable that the resulting
system is as small as possible.</p><p>The tailored system includes the kernel, a number of standard
Linux commands (we were fairly prodigal in adding commands: better
to have all the needed tools at hand when doing maintenance in the
future) and all the related libraries. It also includes the
loadable modules which are needed to manage DOS format volumes.
This may be useful to mount and access either DOS format floppy
disks or the Flash EPROM disk.</p><p>Needless to say, the four programs developed for the gateway,
plus a few ASCII configuration files used at startup by the two
running processes, were also included.</p><p>Due to the Linux bootstrap procedure requirements, the above
components were stored into two files: the compressed kernel image
(450KB) and the compressed root image (2500KB). Just a tiny bit
more than what would fit onto two floppy disks: we actually needed
three floppies for the full distribution. In the BootDisk-HOWTO one
can find a number of hints related to shrinking the size of the
root image, but we felt satisfied with the size reached and did not
want to work more on this aspect.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b5f580.0x1c4f7b0"></a>Bootstrapping the System</h2></div></div><p>The Flash EPROM disk selected for the project (M-Systems
DiskOnChip) is provided with a Linux driver and can be used as a
Linux bootstrap disk. This can be done by including the DiskOnChip
driver into the kernel but also requires some fiddling with a
DiskOnChip configuration utility and a special version of LILO to
make it bootstrappable.</p><p>After a few tests we preferred a different solution:
DiskOnChip was configured as a plain DOS bootstrappable disk. This
has the advantage of avoiding both rebuilding the Linux kernel and
reconfiguring DiskOnChip (it is the device's shipping
configuration) and moreover it was considered a more stable
solution with respect to future releases of the device. The Linux
image files are stored on the DOS file system and Linux is booted
by the LOADLIN utility. This adds around 160KB of DOS files to the
software.</p><p>The system's power-on sequence is thus:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Boot DOS.</p></li><li><p>Run LOADLIN from AUTOEXEC.BAT to boot Linux. The
boot sequence creates the RAM disk containing the Linux file system
and expands into it the compressed root image.</p></li><li><p>Start the protocol converter processes.</p></li></ol></div><p>The protocol converter processes are started at boot time
because they are inserted into the
<span   class="bold"><b>inittab</b></span> table. This also provides
automatic restart in case of a crash of any of the two processes.
</p><p>After booting, if the keyboard and display are connected, the
usual Linux login prompt is displayed and a root login can be done.
This allows us to perform maintenance operations and notably to
launch Linux commands or use either of the two interactive
monitoring programs described above. If needed (e.g., in order to
make modifications to the configuration files without going through
the entire process of making a new root image), the Flash EPROM
disk can be mounted as a DOS volume.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b5f580.0x1c4fcd8"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>We have shown how the use of Linux can solve a typical
problem of data acquisition in an industrial environment. Actually,
we were able to build a system which can do something useful with
32MB of RAM and as little as 8MB of disk space, but the most
noteworthy characteristic of the system is its robustness.</p><p>Disk access is limited to read-only at boot time; the
run-time file system is supported by RAM disk. This means that
restarting after a power failure will never require a file system
check, which could otherwise prevent the boot process from
proceeding. Moreover, because all the system files stay on a
read-only device, it is most unlikely that they are inadvertently
tampered with by anybody. Finally, in case of a program crash,
Linux provides the capability to restart the processes.</p><p>The native support of the compressed kernel and root images
was also very valuable because it allowed us to keep the entire
system very small.</p></div></div>
