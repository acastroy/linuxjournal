    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a46580.0x2b3e558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Over the last few months, we have looked
at Mason, the web development system written by Jonathan Swartz
that combines Apache, <span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span> and
HTML/Perl templates. Normally, Mason is associated with web
applications, especially those that use back-end databases and
produce dynamic content. Indeed, I have found Mason to be an
extremely useful tool in my consulting practice, making it possible
to create web sites quickly and easily.
</p><p>But Mason can be used for more than simple server-side web
applications. One of the most interesting Mason applications is a
set of components known as the &ldquo;Mason content manager&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Mason-CM&rdquo;. Mason-CM provides basic content management
functionality, beginning with its ability to handle the staging of
files to a production server, and continuing with built-in support
for spell checking, RCS version control and editing of Mason
components.</p><p>While Mason-CM is written in Mason and thus requires Apache,
mod_perl and the appropriate Perl modules, it can work just fine
with a static site using nothing but HTML and graphic images. In
fact, I recommend that even site owners uninterested in Mason and
mod_perl take a look at the Mason content manager, because it
provides so many useful features in a simple, free package.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a46580.0x2b3e768"></a>Why Content Management?</h2></div></div><p>As web sites have become increasingly complex, so too have
the organizations surrounding them. Whereas it used to be common
for a professional site to be a one-person operation, it is now
usual for even a small or medium-sized site to have at least three
people: a writer/editor, a designer and a programmer. Even such a
small team will eventually find multiple members trying to edit the
same file simultaneously. This problem was solved years ago by
version control systems, such as RCS and CVS&mdash;but the tools were
designed by and for programmers, and can often be daunting for a
designer or editor to use.</p><p>Moreover, the Web presents a number of challenges that are
different from development in the traditional software world. For
example, software is traditionally written, compiled, tested and
debugged, at which point the cycle begins again until the software
is released. The Web, however, works differently. As soon as an
HTML file in the web document hierarchy is edited, it is
immediately available to everyone on the Internet. This is good
news when someone finds a mistake needing to be fixed quickly, and
also means that sites can update their content on a regular basis
without having to go through long processes. However, it also means
that the results of editing a file&mdash;whether they are improvements
or mistakes&mdash;are immediately available to anyone who happens to
enter the right URL at the wrong time.</p><p>For all of these reasons, most medium- and large-scale web
sites now run two web servers. The first, known as a &ldquo;staging
server&rdquo;, is where the developers, editors and designers can write,
edit and test their changes to the site. Only after files have been
fully tested are they sent to the second web server, known as the
&ldquo;production server&rdquo;.</p><p>Of course, these two servers need not be on separate
computers. They merely need to be separate in some way, to keep
outsiders from seeing the content as it is tested and to ensure
that the staging and production servers have parallel directory
structures.</p><p>Mason-CM is a set of Mason components that makes it
relatively easy for anyone to set up a content management system on
their own server. The user interface is not beautiful, and I had
some minor problems getting it installed on my system. However, it
does the job more than adequately, and makes it possible for
multiple people to work on a project without stepping on each
other's toes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a46580.0x2b3e9d0"></a>Installing Mason-CM</h2></div></div><p>Before you can install Mason-CM, you will need to have a
working copy of Apache with
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span> and Mason installed. (If
you need help installing Mason, see the last three months of &ldquo;At
the Forge&rdquo;.) In addition, you will need to download and install
several Perl modules from CPAN, including MLDBM, Image::Size,
URI::Escape and File::PathConvert. Make sure to import these in
your Apache configuration file (httpd.conf) with the
<b  >PerlModule</b> directive, so as to increase the
amount of memory shared among the various Apache child
processes.</p><p>Mason-CM comes as a gzipped tar file from the Mason home page
(see Resources). The archive should be unpacked into a directory
under your Mason component root. I chose to put it in
/usr/local/apache/mason/cm, where /usr/local/apache/mason is my
Mason component root directory. If you have unpacked the archive
correctly, the /cm directory should contain a
<b  >README</b> and an <b  >INSTALL</b> file. I
will cover all of the steps needed for installation, but it is
probably a good idea to read through those files just in
case.</p><p>Because Mason-CM must ensure that each file is being edited
by only one user at a time, and because a content-management system
should be available to authorized users only, you must restrict
access to the /cm directory using HTTP authentication. Mason-CM
will refuse to run unless it is in a directory that has been
password protected.</p><p>The easiest way to password-protect a directory is to create
a .htaccess file in it. The .htaccess file overrides the default
Apache configuration settings for its directory, as well as any
subdirectories underneath it. For example, here is the .htaccess
file for my content management system:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
AuthName "Content Management System"
AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /usr/local/apache/conf/staging-passwords
require valid-user
</pre><p>The <b  >AuthName</b> directive defines the string
that will be displayed to users when prompted for a password.
(Without such a string, it might be hard for users to remember
which system is requesting a user name and password.) The
<b  >AuthUserFile</b> directive should point to a file
containing user names and encrypted passwords.
</p><p>The password file should be outside of the web document root
directory, so that users cannot retrieve it using their web
browsers. To create or edit the password file, you will need to use
the &ldquo;htpasswd&rdquo; program, which is installed by default in
/usr/local/apache/bin.</p><p>The &ldquo;require valid-user&rdquo; tells Apache that without a user
name and password that match the entries in AuthUserFile, the user
will be denied access to the directory.</p><p>If the .htaccess file does not have any effect, check the
AllowOverride directive in httpd.conf. This directive indicates
which Apache configuration options can be overridden by an
.htaccess file. By default, Apache servers are configured not to
let .htaccess files modify directives of type AuthConfig. You can
change this by putting the following section in httpd.conf:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;Directory /usr/local/apache/mason/cm&gt;
AllowOverride AuthConfig
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre><p>Finally, I found that there was a small bug in my
installation of Mason-CM. Many of the components lack a .html
suffix, making it difficult or impossible for Apache to identify
the content as &ldquo;text/html&rdquo;. So even though Mason-CM components
produced output in HTML-formatted text, the contents were
interpreted by my browser as if they were in unformatted ASCII. To
give Apache some help, I explicitly set the content type using the
mod_perl &ldquo;content_type&rdquo; method. The following autohandler, placed
inside of the /cm directory, automatically sets the content type to
&ldquo;text/html&rdquo; for each document within the directory:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;% $m-&gt;call_next %&gt;
&lt;%init&lt;
$r-&gt;content_type("text/html");
&lt;/%init&gt;
</pre>


Because my <b  >mason.pl</b> configuration file is set to
ignore non-text files, I can be sure that the above will not
accidentally force JPEG and PNG images to be rendered with a type
of &ldquo;text/html&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a46580.0x2b3f108"></a>Configuration</h2></div></div><p>Mason-CM is now in place. However, we need Apache to load a
number of Perl modules in order for it to work. In your Mason
configuration file (which I call &ldquo;mason.pl&rdquo;, but the Mason
documentation calls it &ldquo;handler.pl&rdquo;), insert the following block
of Perl code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
{
   package HTML::Mason::Commands;
   use Fcntl;
   use MLDBM;&lt;\n&gt;
   use Image::Size;
   use URI::Escape;
   use File::PathConvert;
   use File::Copy;
   use File::Find;
   use IO::Handle;
   use IPC::Open2;
}
</pre><p>Now that we have told Apache and Mason where to find
Mason-CM, it is time to configure Mason-CM itself. Nearly all of
the configuration is performed by modifying the cmConfig component,
located in the /cm directory. As of this writing, cmConfig is
written using the old-style Mason interface, which may seem a bit
foreign to those of us who started using Mason with version 0.80.
For example, the initialization block is called
<b  >&lt;%perl_init&gt;</b> rather than simply
<b  >&lt;%init&gt;</b>, and one component invokes another
with <span   class="bold"><b>mc_comp</b></span> rather than
<b  >$m-&gt;comp</b>. Nevertheless, the component should
be relatively easy to recognize and understand by anyone with even
a minimum amount of experience with Mason.
</p><p>The two main variables that must be set at the top of
cmConfig are <b  >$CM_HOME</b> and
<b  >$CM_DATA</b>. (These are defined on line 25 of the
default version of cmConfig, at the top of the
<b  >&lt;%perl_init&gt;</b> section.) The first refers to
the directory in which Mason-CM is installed. The second refers to
the directory in which Mason-CM can store information on the files
it manages, such as locking and version control information. On my
system, I defined them as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $CM_HOME = '/usr/local/apache/mason/cm';
my $CM_DATA = '/usr/local/apache/cmdata';
</pre><p>Both of these directories must exist in order for Mason-CM to
work. While <b  >$CM_HOME</b> should already be defined
(since cmContent is supposed to be inside of
<b  >$CM_HOME</b>), you may need to create the
<b  >$CM_DATA</b> directory. Note that this directory is
different from the Mason data directory, which I typically put in
/usr/local/apache/masondata.
</p><p>Following the definitions of $CM_HOME and $CM_DATA is a large
hash, called <span   class="bold"><b>%cm_config</b></span>. The keys
in %cm_config describe different configuration options, and the
values are the settings for those options. In most cases, the
default options are probably adequate; we will discuss only those
options that you must or should change.</p><p>The &ldquo;admin&rdquo; key refers to the e-mail address of the
Mason-CM administrator. The administrator is responsible for
undeleting files, unlocking locked files and generally managing the
content management system. By default, this is set to be cm-admin,
but you can change the value to something else.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a46580.0x2b3f840"></a>Defining Branches</h2></div></div><p>The value associated with the &ldquo;branches&rdquo; key is an array
reference describing the various &ldquo;branches&rdquo; on the version
control system. While all of the branches must be under
<b  >$CM_HOME</b>, this makes it possible to
differentiate between subsites. For example, a newspaper might have
separate branches for the news, sports and business sections. Each
branch is identified by a unique name, followed by a hash reference
identifying different characteristics associated with the branch.
For example, here is what the &ldquo;branches&rdquo; key looks like for a web
site with a single branch, called &ldquo;Primary&rdquo;:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
branches =&gt; [
      Primary =&gt; {
          path =&gt;'/usr/local/apache/htdocs/staging/content',
          trg_from =&gt; 'staging',
          trg_to =&gt; 'production',
          components =&gt; 0
      }
   ]
</pre><p>The above branch will be displayed in the Mason-CM &ldquo;branch
selector&rdquo; as &ldquo;Primary&rdquo;, and controls all of the documents under
/usr/local/apache/htdocs/staging/content. Make sure the named
directory does not end with a &ldquo;/&rdquo;, or Mason-CM will fail with a
security violation.
</p><p>The &ldquo;trg_from&rdquo; and &ldquo;trg_to&rdquo; keys are used in a simple
substitution, indicating that to move documents from the staging
server to the production server, we replace the string &ldquo;staging&rdquo;
with the string &ldquo;production&rdquo;. (Mason-CM calls the staging process
&ldquo;triggering&rdquo;.) Thus content is initially placed in
/usr/local/apache/htdocs/staging/content, and is staged to the
directory /usr/local/apache/htdocs/production/content. Finally, we
indicate that this branch contains static HTML (rather than Mason
components) by setting the &ldquo;components&rdquo; key to 0.</p><p>A more complicated site might set branches to the following
value:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
branches =&gt; [
        News =&gt; {
            path =&gt; '/usr/local/apache/htdocs/staging/news,
            trg_from =&gt; 'staging',
            trg_to =&gt; 'production',
            components =&gt; 1,
            hidden =&gt; 1
        },
        Business =&gt; {
            path =&gt; '/usr/local/apache/htdocs/staging/business,
            trg_from =&gt; 'staging',
            trg_to =&gt; 'production',
            components =&gt; 1,
            obj_dir =&gt; '/usr/local/apache/staging/obj',
            hidden =&gt; 1
}
]
</pre><p>The above Mason-CM configuration has two branches, known as
&ldquo;News&rdquo; and &ldquo;Business&rdquo;. Because &ldquo;branches&rdquo; is an array
reference rather than a hash reference, its elements are kept in
their original order. This means the branch selector will display
the branches in the order they are entered into branches above.
Changing the order in which branches are displayed is as easy as
modifying the order of elements in the branches array reference.
</p><p>If we set up the branches using the above system, we can then
modify our Apache configuration such that it takes any URL
beginning with /news and rewrites it as /production/news:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Alias /news /usr/local/apache/htdocs/production/news
</pre><p>Now the staging server is hidden from view via a web browser.
We can, however, configure our web server such that all requests to
port 8080, or any other port we choose, are directed toward the
staging server.
</p><p>The &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; tag indicates whether the branch will be
displayed by default in the branch selector. Normally, all branches
are displayed by default, and are available to all users. And any
user can customize the list of branches using the &ldquo;my.CM&rdquo; link in
the upper right-hand corner of the Mason-CM index page, adding and
removing branches from his or her menu. However, making a branch
hidden by default gives new users a relatively clean view of the
content management system.</p><p>Unlike the &ldquo;Primary&rdquo; branch, &ldquo;News&rdquo; and &ldquo;Business&rdquo; are
defined to contain Mason components. Staging a component is
different from staging a static page of HTML, in that Mason-CM will
try to compile the component and test it for errors before actually
allowing it on the production server. In this way, a broken
component will not cause the production web site to fail, but
rather only the staging server. If we want to store the compiled
Mason components in a specific directory, we can specify that with
the &ldquo;obj_dir&rdquo; key.</p><p>cmConfig can be modified in many other ways to customize your
Mason-CM. However, once you have configured
<b  >$CM_HOME</b>, <b  >$CM_DATA</b> and
branches, you can begin to use Mason-CM.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a46580.0x2b36700"></a>The Index Page</h2></div></div><p>To access the main Mason-CM interface, point your web browser
at <b  >$CM_HOME</b>. On my system, I opened the URL
<a href="http://localhost/mason/cm" target="_self">http://localhost/mason/cm/</a>.</p><p>Because this directory is password-protected, I had to enter
a user name and password. Following a successful login, I was
presented with the main Mason-CM index screen. To a large degree,
the index page is a web-based file browser, allowing you to
navigate through the directories and subdirectories in the various
defined branches, open files for reading and writing, and search
for a file by file name or content.</p><p>The index screen is easily identified by the picture of a
juggler. While you can replace this with any image you prefer
(setting the &ldquo;juggler_src&rdquo; key in cmConfig), the image seems
rather appropriate for those of us who work on web sites! Clicking
on this image from anywhere in Mason-CM brings you back to this
main index page.</p><p>Along the right-hand side of the index page is the branch
selector, listing the branches that were defined in cmConfig.
Clicking on a link within the branch selector allows you to handle
staging for that particular branch. The current branch appears in a
slightly different background color from the other branches, so
your current location should always be fairly obvious.</p><p>The current directory is identified in the middle of the
screen, with the &ldquo;current directory&rdquo; headline (and a blue default
background). Each component of the current directory path is a
hyperlink to that path, making it possible to navigate using the
mouse. To switch into a subdirectory, merely click on its name.
Alternately, you can create a new subdirectory by using the text
field in the middle of the screen.</p><p>Above the &ldquo;current directory&rdquo; line is a search system. I am
obviously not the only person who has ever reverted to
<span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span> after failing to remember
where a particular file is stored on a web site. Mason-CM puts both
of these programs into an easy-to-understand package, allowing even
non-UNIX users to search for files within the current branch. The
search supports Perl regular expressions, meaning you can look for
files by name or by content in a variety of ways. Be careful about
what you search for, however; Mason-CM will happily search through
hundreds of files for a complex regular expression, even if the
execution will take a long time.</p><p>Beneath the &ldquo;current directory&rdquo; line is a list of files
available within the current directory. Each file is identified by
name, by its last modification date, by the person who performed
the last modification and by the file's current status. The status
is one of &ldquo;staging&rdquo; (meaning it exists on the staging server
only), &ldquo;prod&rdquo; (the file is identical on the staging and
production servers) and &ldquo;modified&rdquo; (the file exists on both
servers, but has been changed on the saving server).</p><p>You can also create a new file, using a text field and the
&ldquo;create&rdquo; button, just before the list of existing files. Do not
confuse the subdirectory create button with the file create button;
I modified the button definitions in the &ldquo;dirTable&rdquo; and
&ldquo;fileTable&rdquo; components, so that they say &ldquo;create subdirectory&rdquo;
and &ldquo;create file&rdquo;, respectively.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a46580.0x2b36bd0"></a>Viewing and Editing Files</h2></div></div><p>To view the current version of a file, click on its name in
the file table. The HTML source will be displayed at the top of the
browser window. At the bottom of the page, you can ask to see a
rendering of the HTML, to wrap text after 80 columns (rather than
displaying the text verbatim), or to display line numbers along
with the HTML source.</p><p>You can also edit files from within Mason-CM, using a
primitive but functional text editor. To edit a file, click on the
&ldquo;edit&rdquo; link next to the file name. This will bring up a
&lt;textarea&gt; widget containing the file's contents. You can
modify the contents of the file by typing into the &lt;textarea&gt;
field, and can even copy or rename the file using the text field at
the top of the page.</p><p>This editor is nearly as primitive as things can get, with a
barely functioning set of Emacs key bindings for cursor movement.
However, the fact that it lets you make modifications easily and
quickly is certainly an advantage. And it is integrated into the
rest of Mason-CM, in a format that most designers and editors can
understand comfortably.</p><p>From the editing screen, you can choose from a number of
options:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The &ldquo;save&rdquo; button updates the file, and returns
to the editing screen.</p></li><li><p>The &ldquo;save and exit&rdquo; button saves the file to
disk, and returns to the main Mason-CM index page.</p></li><li><p>The &ldquo;save and render&rdquo; button displays the HTML
output produced by the file, and can be used to preview the way a
particular page or Mason component will work.</p></li><li><p>Finally, the redraw button at the bottom of the
screen makes it possible to resize the &lt;textarea&gt; widget,
adjusting its height and width.</p></li></ul></div><p>Mason-CM uses a locking mechanism to ensure that only one
user can edit a file at a given time. If you are editing a file, it
is noted inside a red box at the top of the index page. That box
lists the files on which you're currently working, offering links
to the file editor and to the &ldquo;unlock&rdquo; page.
</p><p>If you try to edit a file that someone else is editing,
Mason-CM will refuse to display the editing screen. Once the file
is unlocked another user will be able to modify it again.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a46580.0x2b371a8"></a>Staging Files</h2></div></div><p>Once a file appears to work correctly on the staging server,
you must move it to the production server. To do this, select one
or more files within a directory with the checkboxes on the
left-hand side of the file table. Then, click on the &ldquo;trigger&rdquo;
button at the bottom of the page. The files will be copied over to
the production server, instantly making them the &ldquo;current&rdquo; copies
of the web site.</p><p>You can trigger all the files in a directory by clicking on
the &ldquo;check all&rdquo; checkbox at the bottom of the page, next to the
trigger button. This is particularly useful when you have created a
new directory and want to use all of the items at once.</p><p>If someone happens to modify the production version of a
file, it is possible to &ldquo;reverse-trigger&rdquo; the file. This copies
the file from the production server onto the staging server. This
is a potentially dangerous operation, and should not be treated
lightly; as a result, Mason-CM asks for explicit confirmation
before allowing such an operation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a46580.0x2b37360"></a>Spell Checking</h2></div></div><p>Once you have the basic Mason-CM functionality working, you
may want to try some of the optional features that it includes.
Perhaps the most interesting feature is the spell checker, which is
a Mason component that uses ispell to check the spelling of the
document. The Mason spell checker ignores HTML tags, so you need
not worry about having to add &ldquo;href&rdquo; to the dictionary.</p><p>To enable spell checking, uncomment the &ldquo;ispell&rdquo;,
&ldquo;main_dict&rdquo; and &ldquo;supp_dict&rdquo; keys in the %cm_config, defined in
cmConfig. They are commented out by default; on my Linux system, I
was able to uncomment them without making any modifications:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ispell      =&gt; '/usr/bin/ispell',
main_dict =&gt; '/usr/lib/ispell/english.hash',
supp_dict =&gt; "$CM_DATA/suppDict",
</pre><p>Once you have defined these keys, the Mason-CM editor will
automatically include a &ldquo;spell check&rdquo; checkbox. This means that
every time you click on &ldquo;save&rdquo;, &ldquo;save and render&rdquo; or &ldquo;save and
exit,&rdquo; the document will be spell-checked. If a word in the
document is misspelled, a small JavaScript program allows you to
choose an alternate, ignore the misspelling, or add the word to a
dictionary. Everyone on a Mason-CM system shares a dictionary,
meaning that if one user adds a word to the dictionary, everyone
else will gain from it. (This also means that if one user
accidentally adds a misspelled word to the dictionary, everyone
will suffer, so be careful!)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a46580.0x2b37570"></a>Version Control</h2></div></div><p>Mason-CM also supports the use of RCS for version control.
This requires mason.pl to import the RCS module along with
Image::Size, URI::Escape, and File::PathConvert. Following that,
define (or uncomment) the following lines from cmConfig:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rcs_bin =&gt; "/usr/bin",
rcs_files =&gt; "$CM_DATA/archive",
</pre><p>Once Mason-CM sees that these values are defined, it adds a
&ldquo;version label&rdquo; text field to the top of the editing page. If you
enter a version label when the document is saved to disk, then RCS
will automatically be used to keep both the older version of the
file and the newer one.
</p><p>Moreover, activating version control means that the file list
will include a &ldquo;versions&rdquo; label. Clicking on this brings up a
list of the document version history, and provides a nice interface
to <span   class="bold"><b>diff</b></span> and the ability to check
out older versions. Version control is almost a necessity when
working on larger web sites, since bugs can creep in almost
anytime, and it's often more important to use a stable, older
version than an unstable, newer version with more features.</p><p>In addition to spell checking and RCS, Mason-CM includes a
number of other features: users can upload files via HTTP and FTP,
and administrators can restrict user access on a per-directory
basis. Because Mason is written in a straightforward dialect of
Perl, it shouldn't be difficult to add other features, such as the
ability to stage to other computers (rather than other directories)
and HTML validation before staging.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a46580.0x2b37830"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Mason may be a powerful tool for creating web sites, but
Mason-CM displays the versatility of this tool. Mason-CM
demonstrates that Mason components may be used to create a tool
that doesn't directly affect the content produced on the Web. I am
very impressed with the variety of tools Mason-CM offers, and while
I won't be giving up GNU Emacs as my editor of choice in the near
future, I do expect to use Mason-CM on a number of my clients'
sites&mdash;both those that use Mason for content generation, and those
that use simpler, less-advanced tools.</p><p><a href="4168s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
