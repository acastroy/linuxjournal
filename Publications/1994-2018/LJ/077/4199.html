    An interview with the CEO of LynuxWorks&mdash;a company that relies heavily
    on the success of embedded Linux.

while attending LinuxWorld. He was quite cordial, soft-spoken and
informed. His passion for his work was apparent. We talked, over
breakfast, about the future of embedded Linux, the release of
BlueCat Linux 1.0 and Linux in general. Dr. Singh is the CEO and
Chairman of LynuxWorks, a company focused on providing embedded
applications to OEMs and beyond. I spoke with him in early July
about the current and future state of the embedded Linux world.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: What made you choose
Linux? What tools/developments would like to see added to
Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Inder</b></span>: At LynuxWorks
(formerly Lynx Real-Time Systems) we have always been a strong
proponent of open standards in the field of real-time and embedded
systems. We started out with implementing a real-time operating
system (RTOS) from the ground up, LynxOS, which was highly
compatible with UNIX (just as Linux is today), and we have played a
pioneering role in the POSIX standardization effort. We were the
first to implement the POSIX real-time extensions and POSIX
threads, which are widely implemented in most UNIX systems today,
and LynxOS was the first non-UNIX system to obtain POSIX
certification.</p><p>Now, Linux has emerged as what we all hoped UNIX would be, a
POSIX-compliant open system, which is available from a large number
of suppliers on a wide array of hardware platforms and rapidly
gaining wide software support.</p><p>Thus, Linux represents a great opportunity for us and a
natural evolution of our open systems strategy. LynxOS is already a
POSIX compliant, hard real-time operating system that is scalable
down to very small footprints (minimum code size 32 Kbytes). And
LynxOS is in many ways closer to Linux than any other RTOS. As a
POSIX certified RTOS, it is highly compatible with Linux at the
source level.</p><p>Additionally, LynxOS uses the same development environment as
Linux, since both are based on the GNU tool chain. And LynuxWorks
customers have frequently used large amounts of application code
from the Linux environment (as well as from other UNIX systems such
as Solaris) and moved them to LynxOS. This generally involved
little porting work beyond recompiling and building. Similarly,
Linux device drivers are easily ported to run on LynxOS.</p><p>The LynxOS kernel provides a highly scalable, fully
preemptible hard real-time kernel specifically designed for
real-time embedded systems. However, much of the non-kernel part of
the LynxOS distribution is based on open-source technology and is
already very close to Linux. This includes the GNU C/C++ compiler
tool chain, X-windows, TCP/IP networking software, a large number
of BSDI utilities, Samba and Apache. LynuxWorks is already heavily
involved in and very familiar with the open-source model.</p><p>So it was a natural step for us to be the first established
RTOS vendor to embrace Linux. As a part of the Lynx Linux
Initiative (L2I), which we announced last November, we introduced
BlueCat, a version of Linux specifically tailored for embedded
applications that builds on our experience and infrastructure
developed over the last decade serving our embedded customers. At
the same time, we decided to evolve our LynxOS technology to bring
the manifold benefits of Linux to LynxOS users. Future releases of
LynxOS will feature full binary compatibility with Linux. The
objective of that move is to insure that a binary executable file
that runs on Linux can be loaded and executed directly on a LynxOS
system (on the same CPU architecture, of course) without requiring
recompilation or porting.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Can you briefly talk
about pros and cons of using Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Inder</b></span>: For the embedded
arena, which is very fragmented and populated with proprietary OS
solutions, Linux provides for the first time the potential of an
open, multi-vendor platform with an exploding base of software and
hardware support.</p><p>The Open Source community development model, with the Web
playing a crucial role, has been key to both the quality and
robustness of Linux, as well as its popularity, and this will
continue to be a major strength. In the embedded market, the
royalty free nature makes it very attractive for high volume,
cost-sensitive applications such as many of the emerging &ldquo;post
PC&rdquo; appliance type of products. The wide availability of source
and a huge and growing web-based developer community facilitates
quick availability of support for new semiconductor devices,
including ports to new CPU architectures. This makes Linux an
important vehicle for tracking the technology curve.</p><p>The growing population of Linux-literate programmers,
consultants and service organizations is a big plus.</p><p>The Linux kernel itself was developed for general purpose
use, and its ongoing development is likely to be driven by the
needs of the server area, particularly upwards scalability in
competition with Solaris and NT. Thus it will fall upon the
embedded Linux vendors like LynuxWorks and others to provide
distributions tailored for embedded use. These vendors are
addressing areas like cross development environments, tools for
embedded systems and support for a variety of hardware
configurations specific to the embedded world. Such embedded
versions of Linux will serve the needs of a significant subset of
embedded applications. However, many embedded applications require
hard real-time performance, or smaller footprints that have been
the province of proprietary RTOSes. There is only so much that you
can do with an implementation that was designed for a different
purpose. LynuxWorks is extending the benefits of Linux to such
applications by its unique approach of supporting the Linux APIs
and ABIs with LynxOS, which has been developed from the ground up
for such applications. One of the nicest things about open
standards is that you can have multiple implementations from
different vendors that meet the needs of different
constituencies.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: What tools/developments
would like to see added to Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Inder</b></span>: A well defined
hardware abstraction layer (HAL) would make Linux a lot easier to
port to a variety of different CPU architectures and hardware
platforms. This is particularly important for embedded systems, but
it would be very helpful for the server area as well, as the world
moves beyond the Wintel architecture. In LynxOS, we use what we
call a CSP/BSP (chip support package/board support package)
architecture which separates out the hardware dependent code
related to the CPU, and the supporting peripherals at the board
level, from the hardware independent code in the rest of the
OS.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: You recently changed
your company name from Lynx to LynuxWorks. Why, and how do you
explain the unique spelling?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Inder</b></span>: The name change makes
a clear statement about our commitment to Linux as our corporate
strategic direction. It is kind of interesting that our previous
name Lynx, which predates Linux, becomes Lynux with the addition of
a &ldquo;u&rdquo;. The unique spelling with the &ldquo;y&rdquo; emphasizes our
continuing commitment to our current LynxOS technology, which is an
integral and important part of our strategy for bringing the
benefits of Linux to the embedded world.</p><p>We have a taken a unique approach to embedded Linux by
offering our customers a choice of two kernels: BlueCat, which is
our open-source Linux distribution tailored for embedded
applications; and LynxOS, our Linux-compatible, POSIX compliant
world-class, real-time operating system (RTOS) technology with a
track record of a decade in demanding, mission-critical
applications.</p><p>The dual OS approach offers choice and flexibility to our
customers and enables us to bring most of the benefits of Linux to
a wide range of applications, including those traditionally served
only by embedded RTOSs.</p><p>From the embedded perspective, you can look upon Linux in two
ways:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>as an excellent open-source operating system
technology which can be adapted to many embedded applications;
and</p></li><li><p>as an open standard platform for software that runs
on Linux, as defined by the Linux APIs and ABIs. Both of these
aspects are very significant for the current and future success of
Linux.</p></li></ul></div><p>The former has a lot to do with the where Linux is today, but
it is the latter aspect of Linux as a platform for a growing base
of open-source as well as commercial applications, in particular,
that will make Linux have its greatest impact on the computer
industry, and especially so in the embedded industry.
</p><p>The key to Linux maintaining its momentum, and having the
huge impact on the computer industry that many proponents are
hoping for, lies in its achieving wide acceptance as an open
standard platform for applications.</p><p>The fact that Linus Torvalds chose to implement the UNIX
interfaces rather than simply create a new operating system, and
that Linux substantially conforms to POSIX, has been largely
responsible for its popularity, and it further strengthens its
position as an open standard.</p><p>In the embedded world, this aspect of Linux is particularly
significant, because this is such a fragmented industry without any
kind of a standard or leading platform. Around half of all embedded
designs still use in-house operating systems, and the leading
commercial RTOS product accounts for only a fraction of new
embedded designs. As a result, the embedded world is missing a
robust software industry such as the software industry that
developed around DOS and Windows for the desktop. Embedded
developers do a lot of reinventing the wheel and developing much
more software from scratch, instead of building on top of existing
tools and application software like their mainstream
counterparts.</p><p>Linux as an open standard has the potential to serve as the
missing platform that can foster an embedded software industry. As
embedded applications are becoming more complex, the boundary
between embedded and mainstream applications is blurring. So more
and more of the mainstream software becoming available on Linux is
already useful for embedded developers.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Congratulations on being
named to the directorial board of the recently formed Embedded
Linux Consortium. What role do you see yourself playing within the
Consortium? Will it be greater on the technical side, with regard
to developing standards, etc., or on the marketing/promotional
side, with regard to getting OEMs to consider embedded Linux as
platform?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Inder</b></span>: Thank you.</p><p>I strongly believe that Linux has an enormous and beneficial
role to play in the embedded area. In fact, Linux will eventually
have an even bigger play in embedded systems than in servers, and I
believe that the Embedded Linux Consortium can play a very
influential role.</p><p>The initial focus of the ELC is largely in the promotional,
marketing and communications area, to create greater awareness of
Linux's benefits and create market momentum, but it will
undoubtedly evolve depending in large part on the desire of the
membership.</p><p>It is very important for the embedded Linux community to
avoid a rerun of the &ldquo;UNIX Wars&rdquo;. The ELC can play a key role in
getting the embedded Linux community to rally behind standards
activity such as the Linux Standards Base and POSIX, although the
ELC is not planning to directly engage in the development of
standards at this time.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: What are the issues that
embedded Linux systems providers need to agree on, given the fact
that they are competing with each other also?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Inder</b></span>: Avoiding
fragmentation even as we compete with each other is really the most
important issue, which I have covered in answer to your previous
question on the subject. The key is to establish Linux as an open
standard platform for applications to foster the growth of an
embedded software industry around Linux. A broad agreement to build
in the standardization work of the POSIX and LSB groups instead of
creating new APIs or standards that favor a single vendor, and a
recognition that it is in our mutual interest to support Linux as
an open standard in preference to proprietary single-vendor
solutions, even as we compete and add our own kinds of unique
value, is something we should all work towards to avoid a replay of
what happened to UNIX over the last decade.</p><p>It is also important for embedded Linux providers to be good
members of the Open Source community, make meaningful contributions
to the open code base and adhere to not only the letter but also
the spirit of the open-source rules. I believe in this strongly,
even though at LynuxWorks we provide both open-source and licensed
products.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: In regards to embedded
Linux deployment: How promising is the handheld arena for embedded
Linux&mdash;given the current preference for OSes like Windows
CE/Windows Pocket PC? What are some of the other major areas for
embedded Linux that LynuxWorks' has taken or plans to take
advantage of?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Inder</b></span>:In spite of the
current dominant position of PalmOS, and the strong Microsoft push
with Windows CE and PocketPC, I believe Linux can still establish a
major position in the handheld arena. This whole field of &ldquo;post PC
appliances&rdquo; is still in a state of flux, with a plethora of new
Internet connected devices of many kinds about to hit the market
over the next year or two. As an open system supported by many
vendors, Linux is a very attractive candidate, and many large
vendors that we are working with are in fact designing many next
generation products around Linux. The low royalty costs (can't get
much cheaper than zero!), freedom from dominance by a single vendor
and the huge community of potential developers of add-on software
makes Linux a very attractive choice.</p><p>In addition to the emerging applications in this post PC
appliance arena, we are also addressing the automobile, point of
sale terminals and wireless markets, as well as the broad Internet
and communications infrastructure area, the aerospace and military
industry and instrumentation with our Linux based thrust. In fact,
I have been pleasantly surprised at the broad interest in Linux
across all the markets that we have been addressing.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: The standard C library
for Linux is the GNU C library, or glibc, which is rather large.
(libc-2.1.3.so on my box is almost 900K, and a statically linked
&ldquo;hello world&rdquo; is more than 200K.) How can embedded Linux vendors
keep embedded code small while at the same time maintain the
advantages of a large pool of contributors and testers?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Inder</b></span>:This is one of the
areas in which embedded Linux vendors can add special value by
providing facilities that offer more configurability and greater
control over the &ldquo;footprint&rdquo;. As your question makes clear, this
applies not just to the kernel, but compilers, libraries and other
parts of the environment. In the case of libraries, the objective
would be to include only the minimum amount of code required for a
given system, and cutting down on loading any unneeded code.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Everyone's talking about
preventing fragmentation, to the point where
fragmentation-prevention strategies seem to be fragmenting. What's
the One True Way to prevent fragmentation?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Inder</b></span>: The success of an
operating system is dependent on the applications support that it
generates more than any other single factor. So I would say that
the One True Way to prevent fragmentation is a strong,
industry-wide commitment to ensure that there is a clear definition
of what constitutes &ldquo;a Linux application&rdquo;, and that an
application developer has the assurance that a single version of
his or her application will run on any Linux system.</p><p>The Linux Standard Base (LSB) project, whose specific goal is
&ldquo;to develop and promote a set of standards that will increase
compatibility among distributions and enable software applications
to run on any compliant Linux system&rdquo;, is intended to prevent this
very problem. It deserves strong support from application
developers and users.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: There's a plethora of
cheap boards, free developer tools and Internet discussions about
embedded Linux. It's a virtual toy store. If I'm a Linux hobbyist
looking to build a cool toy, like an embedded Internet stereo for
my car or an autopilot for my model airplane, where do I
start?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Inder</b></span>: First I would look at
what are the requirements of the entire system that I am trying to
build. Then, I would select a basic hardware platform and a version
of embedded Linux.</p><p>For a hobbyist application, I would recommend starting with
an inexpensive Pentium PC motherboard, perhaps one of the many
small variants with smaller form factors. For a commercial
application, one would also explore other architectures, including
system-on-chip (SOC) solutions which provide a variety of different
adjunct processing functionalities (i.e., communications
controllers, display controllers, etc.) that are being added onto
the core chip and satisfy a variety of embedded system
needs.</p><p>Next, continuing to focus on a commercial rather than a hobby
application, I would find a Linux supplier that fully tests this
processor technology with their embedded Linux Product. The
available testing on the standard PC is very well supported but on
other architectures is more &ldquo;spotty.&rdquo; I would also look at the
long term stability of the vendor and if they are ISO 9001 quality
process certified. Additionally, I would look at what the chances
are that the vendor will be around for the next ten years, for
support and additional upgrades to the Linux product. Most embedded
systems have a much longer lifecycle than the lifecycle of a
standard PC. Finding the right software vendor for a long term
solution can often be most important to the success of the project.
So, in some cases, choosing the right processor might come from the
list of the supported platforms from your preferred software
provider.</p><p>I would also use the Web as a tool to look for other pieces
required for the solution, such as digital tuners and Linux drivers
to support the required hardware components. This is one of the
great benefits of using Linux&mdash;the Web based community and all of
the useful hardware and software solutions, as well as advice, that
are available.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: TiVo printed a notice in
their product manual stating that any customer who wanted a copy of
their modified Linux kernel could get one by writing to a certain
address. This is a great way for a company to both fulfill its
obligations under the GPL and build a mailing list of hackers. Is
this the plan other vendors of devices containing Linux will
adopt?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Inder</b></span>: This is a reasonable
solution to complying with the GPL requirements for device
manufacturers who use Linux as the OS for their embedded software.
They only need to do this if they make modifications to the Linux
kernel itself. If they simply use an embedded Linux product such as
BlueCat Linux from a vendor like LynuxWorks and build their
embedded application on it without making any changes to the
kernel, which is the norm, then this is not an issue for them. It
is the responsibility of the embedded Linux OS vendor to provide
the sources to all the changes made to tailor Linux for embedded
applications. We do this by including the sources in our
distribution, and we plan to make the sources available on our web
site as well.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: The Linux kernel
developers are struggling with the issue of devices that can be
added and removed on the fly, like PCMCIA cards and USB devices. Do
you think that the need to support these devices will make the
kernel too complicated for embedded systems? And how responsive do
you think the &ldquo;mainstream kernel&rdquo; is to the needs of embedded
Linux developers?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Inder</b></span>: You are going to see
increased use of both USB and PCMCIA interfaces and devices in
embedded systems. Supporting dynamic plugging and unplugging of
such devices is essential, especially for embedded products where
you should never have to reset or reboot a system. The important
thing for embedded systems is to make sure that, as for many other
facilities, this is configurable and you do not carry the code
whether your need the facility or not.</p><p>The issue is broader than USB and PCMCIA. Dynamic
reconfiguration of any embedded system is desirable whether it is
for detecting devices on system start or being able to add or
remove devices on the fly. This often allows system developers to
have one core kernel (for system support and configuration control
considerations), especially in embedded devices where the customers
might need a minimal memory footprint. In this case, only the
needed kernel drivers and applications are added to the system upon
detection. In some cases, embedded developers are looking at having
the required drivers on the piece of hardware that is inserted and,
at device installation, the driver is extracted from the hardware
and installed into the system. This level of dynamic
reconfiguration increases the usefulness of the system as a
whole.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Any plans to fund more
open-source software that can be available to embedded Linux
developers? Tools like media compression and decompression or voice
and handwriting recognition would come in handy, for
example.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Inder</b></span>: We recently announced
the contribution of our LynuxWorks Messenger technology for BlueCat
Linux to the Open Source community to establish a new standard for
advanced CompactPCI inter-board messaging in distributed and high
availability (HA) systems. Implemented as a kernel extension and
associated ApplicationProgramming Interface (API) for messaging,
LynuxWorks. Messenger is a technology that enables CPU boards
(system and non-system) to exchange information on a peer-to-peer
basis across the CompactPCI backplane.</p><p>We have also contributed multi-threading extensions to the
GDB debugger to the Open Source community.</p><p>We fully intend to continue to support and make significant
contributions to the Open Software community.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Thank you very much for
your time.</p></div></div>
