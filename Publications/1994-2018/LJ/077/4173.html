Bad</a>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Manufacturer: Axis Communications</p></li><li><p>E-mail: info@axisinc.com</p></li><li><p>Price: $499</p></li><li><p>Reviewer: Jason Schumaker</p></li></ul></div>

Axis Communications sent <i  >Linux Journal</i> one of
their 2100 network cameras for review. I was lucky enough to spend
a week playing with the thing, and I am very impressed. The camera
is running Linux (version 2.0.33) and is powered by Axis' own
chip&mdash;the Etrax-100.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2480580.0x2578b30"></a>The Camera</h2></div></div><p>Axis bills the 2100 as a &ldquo;plug and watch digital camera with
direct network attach&rdquo;. Accurate enough. It truly does have an
&ldquo;appliance&rdquo; feel. A PC is not needed&mdash;the camera operates
stand-alone, requiring only a LAN or modem connection. It has a
built-in web server, which allows you to view images through a
browser and throw those images directly out on the Internet (or
not). So, you can interact with friends, jazz up your web page,
create small movies, monitor your home/office or, ahem, start a
business.</p><p>The camera weighs, excluding mini-tripod and power supply, a
mere half of a pound. There is a feeling of fragility to the
thing&mdash;one of the few &ldquo;bad things&rdquo; about the camera (see
Sidebar). Axis does have an industrial strength camera in the
works, but no release date has been set. I actually knocked the
camera down at one point (please don't tell the folks at Axis!). It
fell about two feet and landed on the floor. The images on the
screen froze. After two hours and a $500 transfer from savings to
checking, I pushed the camera's reset button, which reboots the
camera. Everything was fine after that. A heavier, more durable
version will certainly be needed, especially for brutes like
me.</p><p>For $450-$499 you will get the camera, a mini-tripod, one 12V
AC adaptor, a null modem cable, a PS-D extension cable, along with
the user's guide. The price seems quite fair, considering the
myriad of functions it can serve, not to forget the entertainment
value. The lens can be replaced with any standard C or CS lens,
which I would recommend. The factory lens is fine, but having more
lens power is always good.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2480580.0x2578ce8"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>The Axis 2100 is itching to be used. The set up is painless
and quick, though personal error, lack of certain permissions and
little patience on my part added time. Linux/UNIX users may need to
be logged in as root, which might not sit too well with some sys
admins. I needed to be root in order to use the arp command.</p><p>The camera can be installed on a network or to a modem. I
went the network route, so will not be providing the modem
installation procedures here. That method is a bit more
complicated, but after a quick reading, I wouldn't think it to be
difficult. Axis has made the installation process easy, unless
you're completely unfamiliar with Linux.</p><p>It took nearly as long to free the 2100 from the packaging as
it did to get it running. There were some &ldquo;non-camera&rdquo; related
issues to work through. To begin with, plugging the AC adaptor into
the outlet really helped. Then, choosing a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>working</em></span> Ethernet port got me one step closer.
And, finally, reading the enclosed &ldquo;Addendum&rdquo;, which informed of
a possible need to &ldquo;reinstate the Factory Default settings&rdquo;,
proved instrumental in getting the camera operational. What can I
say, excitement got the better of me!</p><p>The accompanying &ldquo;User's Guide&rdquo; provided installation
commands for both Windows and UNIX systems. The first command
wasn't quite right for a Linux system, but a quick query to the
<i  >LJ</i> tech department provided clarification. The
following commands are what worked for me and are different from
those in the 2100 User Guide. To install the camera to my Ethernet
network, I typed (in an xterm):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/sbin/arp -s 192.168.3.72 00:40:8c:10:00:86 temp
</pre><p>where the IP address was issued from my sys admin and the
Ethernet address is the serial number from the bottom of the
camera. I then ping'd the IP address:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ping 192.168.3.72
</pre>


That's it. I opened a web browser and entered the IP address (i.e.,
http://192.168.3.72). A page quickly opened and there I was, caught
in a side view, bad posture revealed. I was immediately struck by
the quality of the image and the speed at which my movements were
followed. This camera delivers between 3-10 images/second. Speed
can be effected by bandwidth, your computer and browser type,
monitor resolution and more. The images produced were close enough
to real-time to amaze the entire <i  >LJ</i> staff.
Laurie Tucker, <i  >LJ</i>'s Special Projects person,
described it best by saying, &ldquo;It looks like a moving painting.&rdquo;
Images are a bit &ldquo;trippy&rdquo;, but the quality is one step closer to
real-time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2480580.0x2579160"></a>Viewing Images and Configuration</h2></div></div><p>Images can be viewed straight through a customized web page
or by uploading them to a remote FTP server. I didn't use the
latter, but it can be configured to alert you, via e-mail, when a
new image has been uploaded. Setting the camera to upload an image
every five minutes could work nicely for home or office security.
An adaptor on the back of the camera allows for hook up to devices
such as motion detectors and doorbells.</p><p>All camera configuration is web-based, by using the
&ldquo;Installation Wizards&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Application Tools&rdquo;. These are
presented in GUI form and are used to define the system, set
security preferences and tweak image and layout settings. Simply
click on either link, which conveniently sit just to the right of
the image(s) being displayed. The &ldquo;Application Tools&rdquo; allow you
to modify anything from image resolution, to color, time,
background color, image title and so on. The &ldquo;Installation
Wizards&rdquo; is nicely organized into the following sections:
security, date and time, image settings, focus, modem or network
and TCP/IP. You are also given the option of uploading images to an
FTP site.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2480580.0x25792c0"></a>Security and the FTP Daemon</h2></div></div><p>By default, the camera is set to allow anyone access. This
can be changed by registering the camera to a single user. That
single user is then given the ability to set security permissions
to individual users&mdash;requiring a user name and password for access.
Similar to most Linux systems.</p><p>The 2100 has telnet turned off but does run an FTP daemon. To
log into the camera, I FTP'd to the IP address of &ldquo;my&rdquo; camera's
web page, then logged in as root, using &ldquo;pass&rdquo; for the password.
Doing this allowed me to root through /proc files (see Listings 1
and 2). This is also the method for downloading upgrades to the
camera, or uploading code, which is the coolest thing about this
camera. Unlike most appliances running embedded Linux, you can go
in and change things, if you are so inclined. As Jon Corbet writes
(see Resources), &ldquo;Axis makes available everything that is needed
to do this: versions of the compiler and libraries (licensed under
the GPL) are at the Axis developer site. It's mostly a matter of
cross-compiling the code and FTPing into the camera.&rdquo;</p><p><a href="4173l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. 2100 Cpu

Linux to their products in December 1997 (kernel 2.0.33) This port,
along with their developers not wanting to spend time developing a
new OS, made Linux an obvious choice to run the 2100 web camera.
The source code to the Linux port is licensed under the GPL and can
be downloaded from the Axis site. Here's the hardware, as listed in
the user's guide:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>ARPTEC-1 compression chip; ETRAX-100</p></li><li><p>32-bit RISC</p></li><li><p>100 MIPS CPU</p></li><li><p>8MB RAM</p></li><li><p>2MB FLASH PROM</p></li></ul></div><p>The camera specifications, for those of you in the know:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Digital, 24-bit color</p></li><li><p>Image pickup device: 1/4'' inch HAD RGB progressive
scan CCD</p></li><li><p>HxV: 659x494</p></li><li><p>Backlight Compensation</p></li><li><p>Automatic AGC</p></li><li><p>White balance: automatic, fixed indoor, fixed
fluorescent, fixed outdoor and hold</p></li><li><p>Electronic shutter: 1/30s - 1/30000s, light
condition adaptive</p></li></ul></div>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2480580.0x2972220"></a>Requirements</h2></div></div><p>High bandwidth is the place to start. If you plan to transfer
files from the camera over the Internet, a DSL (or equivalent)
connection is the way to go. To view images, Axis recommends a
&ldquo;PC, ideally Pentium 300 or higher, with a high-speed graphics
card and 100MB Ethernet network card&rdquo;. The only software necessary
is TCP/IP and either Netscape Navigator (their recommendation) or
Internet Explorer. You will also need an IP address, Ethernet
cable(s) and a network hub.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2480580.0x2972328"></a>A Cool Camera and Company</h2></div></div><p>The 2100 network camera seems solid, as does the company
producing it. Axis has been around since 1984. Headquartered in
Lund, Sweden, they have more than 500 employees working at 28
offices worldwide. There Etrax-100 chip is a product in its own
right and is used in numerous Axis products, ranging from cameras
to print servers. Any product that can work with Linux, does. Axis
makes source codes available on their developer site. This includes
the code to their own Journaling Flash File System (JFFS), which
the Axis site says is &ldquo;aimed at providing a crash/powerdown-safe
file system for disk-less embedded devices&rdquo;. It allows the camera
to be turned off and on without having to reboot&mdash;providing the
necessary &ldquo;always on&rdquo; functionality.</p><p>I have spent the past week toying around with the camera, and
I am still excited about it. I want one. Though it is designed for
indoor use only, it does well with that. Images are crisp and
quick. This is embedded Linux in action and the results are
exciting. It's a Sunday, and I'm at work, playing with the camera.
That should speak volumes.</p></div></div>
