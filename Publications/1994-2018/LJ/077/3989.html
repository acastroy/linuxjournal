Tkinter, buy this book. If you need to do graphical programming in
Python but don't know what tools to use, buy this book. Now that
the hard part of the review is done, let me give you a little
background on my Tk experiences, and then get on to the details of
the book.</p><p>About five years ago, armed with John Osterhout's book,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tcl and the TK Toolkit</em></span> I started to play with
Tcl and Tk. While I appreciated how you could toss together
something very quickly, I was also very frustrated by Tcl. It just
didn't feel like a real programming language. There was always the
need for a &ldquo;trick&rdquo; to accomplish what I wanted. Because of this
bad feeling, I never did much with Tcl and Tk.</p><p>Last year, when I interviewed Guido van Rossum, I asked him
about toolkits for doing graphical programming in Python, and he
recommended Tkinter. He also pointed out that the current problem
was a lack of good documentation. Python and Tkinter has addressed
that problem, and done a fine job as well.</p><p>The book assumes the reader has a basic knowledge of Python,
but requires no knowledge of Tcl or Tk. The first part, only 28
pages, is a quick review of Python, an intro to Tkinter and a
sample application. Thus, by page 28, you will be convinced that
you, too, could write a calculator or two. Even in this
introductory chapter, the author does an excellent job of
discussing the various sections of the code.</p><p>The next part, titled &ldquo;Displays&rdquo;, goes on for close to 300
pages. This is the meat of the book, covering all the things you
will need to build your application. First, widgets are covered,
including Pmw (Python MegaWidgets) and then geometry managers. By
the end of these two chapters, you should be pretty comfortable
putting up any sort of widget you want and getting the screen
organized.</p><p>Each concept is presented with some explanatory text, some
code and a screen shot. The code is on track for teaching you the
next thing you need to know, rather than being just a book of
sample code. Part of the credit goes to Python itself, where you
can write something useful in a few lines, but the author has done
a good job of breaking up the material so that a concept can be
presented in only a few pages.</p><p>The next chapter, titled &ldquo;Using Classes, Composites and
Special Widgets&rdquo;, gets you seriously using structured programming
techniques to develop your application. While this is a little
scary for those of us who grew up on FORTRAN and moved to C, it is
well worth embracing if you want to be a good Python
programmer.</p><p>The next four chapters take you through drawing all sorts of
objects. First there are &ldquo;Dialogs and Forms&rdquo;, where you finish up
with a really fancy calculator. Next is &ldquo;panels and Machines&rdquo;,
where you learn how to do very complex graphics models. A digital
multimeter complete with rotary selector switch is one such
example. The next two chapters cover more free-form drawing and
finally charts and graphs. The part ends with a short chapter on
the window manager.</p><p>Part three, titled &ldquo;Putting it All Together...&rdquo;, is a
catch-all for the other things you need to know. This includes
extending Python, debugging and issues of performance and style.
The part ends with a chapter on distributing Tkinter
applications.</p><p>The remainder of the book, over 250 pages, consists of
appendices. This seems to be the tradition for most Python books.
It makes sense, due to the lack of printed reference documentation
on Python.</p><p>The first appendix is called &ldquo;Mapping Tk to Tkinter&rdquo;. If
you have an existing application in Tk that you want to port, this
is where you will find all the answers. It can also provide some
help if you are familiar with Osterhout's book and want a quick
translation guide.</p><p>Appendix B is a Tkinter reference. The reference includes
descriptions of the classes, along with detailed descriptions of
all options. When appropriate, graphics are also included.</p><p>Appendix C is a reference on Python megawidgets. Like the
previous appendix, the descriptions are detailed and graphics are
included when needed.</p><p>Appendix D covers building and installing Python and Tkinter.
Information is included for UNIX and MS-Windows, with a brief
mention of MacOS.</p><p>The appendices end with three short sections: Events and
keysyms, Cursors and References. While each appendix is very brief,
it covers important topics.</p><p>The book ends with a comprehensive index. As I said in the
beginning, if you are going to work with Tkinter, buy this book.
I'm not saying this because it is the only book out there. It is
well organized, easy to read and offers a great tutorial combined
with a comprehensive reference.</p></div></div>
