FFmpeg allows Linux users to convert video files easily between a variety
of different formats.

Today's affordable digital video cameras have placed the power
of digital recording within most people's reach. Unfortunately, this has been
accompanied with a corresponding increase in the variety of file formats
and codecs available. Some of these formats are more efficient
than others, and some are less encumbered by proprietary licensing
restrictions. So, having the ability to convert from one format to another
is a great help, as you can decide what format you are comfortable with
and use that one instead of being restricted to a specific file format.
</p><p>
FFmpeg is a simple and straightforward application that allows Linux users
to convert video files easily between a variety of different formats. In
this article, I walk you through installing FFmpeg and provide a few instructive examples
to demonstrate the range of applications for which it can be used.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe8c580.0xf843a0"></a>
FFmpeg Installation</h2></div></div><p>
FFmpeg is an open-source audio and video converter that supports most
industry-standard codecs and can convert from one file format to another
quickly and easily. It also lets you capture video and audio from a live
source and process it.
</p><p>
The source code for FFmpeg is available for download from the project
Web site (<a href="http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net/index.php" target="_self">ffmpeg.sourceforge.net/index.php</a>) and at
the time of this writing, the latest version available
at the site is 0.4.9-pre1.
</p><p>
Once you download the file, extract it using the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -zxf ffmpeg-0.4.9-pre1.tar.gz
</pre>
</p><p>
This creates a new directory containing the source code for FFmpeg. To
install it with the default configuration options, run
<tt  >./configure</tt>
from within the FFmpeg source directory. Once the
configuration script finishes, compile it by issuing
<tt  >make</tt>. Once the compile finishes without any
errors,
you can install FFmpeg by running <tt  >make install</tt>
as root.
</p><p>
On the other hand, if you like to have control over what is installed
and prefer customizing software installs, you can pass some command-line
parameters to the configure script. To see all the options
available for the installer, run the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./configure --help
</pre>
</p><p>
This command gives you multiple screens of the various settings that
can be modified, and you can choose any options you like. The on-screen
display does a decent job of explaining what each option does, so I will
not go into a lot of detail on this.
</p><p>
I suggest that you enable the following options, but this is not a
requirement&mdash;feel free to experiment:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
--enable-mp3lame: highly recommended&mdash;you won't be able to encode
MP3s without this. Needs lame to be installed already.
</p></li><li><p>
--enable-a52: enables GPLed A52 support, needed for decoding some
VOB files.
</p></li><li><p>
--enable-gpl: required for the previous component; otherwise, not
needed.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
As I didn't have lame installed on my system, I ran the following command
to configure FFmpeg:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./configure --enable-a52 --enable-gpl
</pre>
</p><p>
Once the configuration is complete, read through the output to make sure
no errors were generated. Then, run <tt  >make</tt>, and
go have a drink or something as this might take a little while. Once
the system finishes compiling FFmpeg, run <tt  >make
install</tt> as root to
install FFmpeg, and you are done with the installation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe8c580.0xf84ce8"></a>
Basic Usage</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have successfully installed FFmpeg, you can start experimenting
with it. The first thing you have to do is choose a video file with which to
experiment. As this is your first time with FFmpeg, making a backup
copy of this file is highly recommended. You don't want to be responsible
for ruining the only copy of a rare video.
</p><p>
This input file most probably has been encoded using a particular codec,
but because FFmpeg supports most of the popular formats, we don't need to
worry a lot about that. Formats supported by FFmpeg include MPEG, MPEG-4
(Divx), ASF, AVI, Real Audio/Video and Quicktime. To see a list of all
the codecs/formats supported by FFmpeg, run the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ffmpeg --formats
</pre>
</p><p>
A detailed list of supported file formats is also available at the FFmpeg
site.
</p><p>
FFmpeg supports a large list of command-line parameters that control
various settings in FFmpeg. To get a listing of the various options
available, run the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ffmpeg --help
</pre>
</p><p>
Don't let the multipage listing scare you from using FFmpeg, the basic
usage is actually very simple. To convert a file with the default
settings,
run the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ffmpeg -i InputFile OutputFile
</pre>
</p><p>
The -i option tells FFmpeg that the filename immediately after it is the
name of the file to be used as input. If this option is omitted, FFmpeg
attempts to overwrite that file when it tries to create the output
file. FFmpeg uses the extension of the output file to try to determine
the format and codec to use, though this can be overridden using
command-line parameters (more on this later).
</p><p>
The default settings create an output file that has radio-quality
sound (64kbps bitrate) and very bad video quality (200kbps
bitrate). Fortunately, these settings can be changed for each encoding,
which allows you to choose the quality of each file depending on the need.
</p><p>
To change the audio bitrate, add <tt  >-ab
<i>bitrate</i></tt> to the command
used earlier, where <tt  ><i>bitrate</i></tt> is the bitrate you want to use. See <a href="http://www.mp3-tech.org/tests/gb" target="_self">www.mp3-tech.org/tests/gb</a> for information on the sound
quality the various bitrates represent. I prefer to
encode files with a bitrate between 128&ndash;192kbps depending my needs,
but you can put in a higher value if you so desire. Keep in mind,
however,
that the higher the bitrate you use, the larger the output file size will be.
Also keep in mind that if your source file is encoded in a low bitrate,
increasing the bitrate won't accomplish much other than increasing
the output file size.
</p><p>
Now, getting a CD-quality audio track for the video doesn't really make
sense if the video looks like it was taken using a five-year-old Webcam
having a bad day. Thankfully, this problem also is easily solved by adding
another parameter to the command line.
</p><p>
To change the video bitrate, add the <tt  >-b
<i>bitrate</i></tt>
option to the command
line. The bitrate here can be any numeric value you like, and I have seen
bitrates all the way up to 23,000 (DVD Rips). Although the quality of video
encoded with a 23,000kbps bitrate is amazing, the resulting file size
of that encoding is also very amazing (a 90-minute video is about 4GB). In
my experience, most videos look pretty decent at bitrates between
1,000&ndash;1,400, but this is a personal preference, so play with the
numbers until
you figure out what works for you.
</p><p>
So, to encode a video with a 128kbps audio bitrate and 1,200kbps
video stream, we would issue the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ffmpeg -i InputFile.avi -ab 128 -b 1200 OutputFile.mpg
</pre>
</p><p>
If you are creating a video CD or DVD, FFmpeg makes it even
easier by letting you specify a target type. Then, it uses the target
type to
calculate the format options required automatically. To set a target
type, add <tt  >-target <i>type</i></tt>;
<tt  ><i>type</i></tt> can be vcd, svcd, dvd, dv,
pal-vcd or ntsc-svcd on the command line. So, if we were creating a
VCD, we would run the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ffmpeg -i InputFile.mpg -target vcd vcd_file.mpg
</pre>
</p><p>
FFmpeg also has support for encoding audio files. The command to
convert audio files is the same as the command to encode video files.
To convert a WAV file to a 128kbps MP3 file, issue the
following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ffmpeg -i Input.wav -ab 128 Output.mp3
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, the biggest selling point of FFmpeg is that you can customize
it to a level that you are comfortable with. So, if all you want to
do is convert from one codec to another, and you don't really care about
the advanced features, you can stop reading here and still be
able to encode/decode videos. On the other hand, if you like to have more
control over the encoding, keep reading as we cover more of the advanced options available in FFmpeg.
</p><p>
There are far too many options available in FFmpeg for me to go over each
of them here, so I cover some of the ones I found most interesting
and leave the rest for you to explore.

Forcing the Use of a Particular Video Codec</h2></div></div><p>
There are a times when you will want to encode a video using a
particular codec and file format. FFmpeg lets you choose the codec with
which you want to encode by adding <tt  >-vcodec codec</tt> to the command line,
where codec is the name of the codec you want to use. So if we want
to encode using the MPEG-4 codec at 1,200kbps video bitrate and 128kbps
audio bitrate, the command looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ffmpeg -i InputFile.mpg -ab 128 -b 1200 -vcodec mpeg4 OutputFile.avi
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe8c580.0xf85a50"></a>
Remove the Audio Stream</h2></div></div><p>
Let's say you have recorded a video that has a lot of background noise
and undesired commentary, so you decide to remove the audio
component of the video completely. To accomplish this, all you have to do is add the
-an option to the command line, and FFmpeg
automatically removes all
audio from the output. Keep in mind that using this option negates any
other option that affects the audio stream.
</p><p>
So, in our example, to remove the audio component, we would
run the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ffmpeg -i InputFile.mpg -an -b 1200 OutputFile.avi
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe8c580.0xf85c08"></a>
Remove the Video Stream</h2></div></div><p>
Let's say you downloaded a news video from the Net that you want to listen
to on your iPod on the way to work, but in order to do that, you
have to remove the video component from the output file. FFmpeg allows
you to remove the video component of the file completely by adding the
-vn option to the command line. Using this option negates any other
option that affects the video stream.
</p><p>
So, in our example, to remove the video component and save
the audio as a 256kbps MP3 file, we would run the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ffmpeg -i InputFile.mpg -vn -ab 256 OutputFile.mp3
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe8c580.0x137e010"></a>
Choose between Multiple Audio Streams to Encode the Output
File</h2></div></div><p>
Many DVDs have multiple language tracks available, and you can
choose in which language you want to watch the video. Having multiple
audio tracks is cool if you speak multiple languages and want
to be able to watch videos in multiple languages. However, if you
don't speak multiple languages, the extra audio tracks are useless
and are taking up disk space.
</p><p>
FFmpeg lets you choose which streams you want to keep
and ignore the rest. The command-line parameter that allows
you to map streams is called -map. So, if in our test file, stream 0 is
the video stream, stream 1 is the Spanish audio stream and stream 2 is
the English audio stream, and we want to keep the English audio in the
output file, we would issue the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ffmpeg -i InputFile.mpg -map 0:0 -map 2:1 -b 1200 OutputFile.avi
</pre>
</p><p>
In my experience, stream 0 in most video files is usually the video
stream, and the remaining streams are the audio streams available with the video.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
FFmpeg provides a wide range of options
for manipulating and converting video files between a variety of formats. For more information, or to download the latest version of FFmpeg for yourself, please refer to the project Web site.
