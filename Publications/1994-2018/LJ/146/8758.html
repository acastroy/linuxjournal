All about Tripwire and what it can do for you.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2735580.0x282d1e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Tripwire is an intrusion detection system (IDS), which,
constantly and automatically, keeps your critical system
files and reports under control if they have been destroyed or modified by a cracker (or
by mistake). It allows the system administrator to know immediately
what was compromised and fix it.
</p><p>
The first time Tripwire is run it stores checksums, exact sizes and
other data of all the selected files in a database. The successive runs
check whether every file still matches the information in the database
and report all changes. Tripwire initially was released in 1992. Today,
several programs share this name, one is GPLed and two are proprietary. The
rest of this article discusses only the GPL version 2.3.1.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2735580.0x282d348"></a>
When Is the Right Moment to Start Using Tripwire?</h2></div></div><p>
IDS tools are particular beasts, and Tripwire is no exception. Even if
you don't need to be an expert programmer to use this package, actually
taking advantage of it requires some patience, attention and manual
work.
</p><p>
First, using Tripwire is one of those cases in which blindly
pressing Enter at every prompt really isn't a smart thing to do.
Do yourself a favor and check at least the relevant parts of the good
documentation provided with the Tripwire programs (more on this later).
</p><p>
Second, using Tripwire for real makes sense only if it is
installed, fully configured and initialized at the very first boot after
an installation from scratch, before ever connecting to the Internet or
doing anything else. It takes only one attack to install a back door. All
you would accomplish by installing and using Tripwire after such an
event would be to guarantee that the back door remains just as open as
the day a cracker installed it! Of course, even if you don't want to or
can't re-install everything now, nothing prevents you from downloading the
package anyway and becoming familiar with it.
</p><p>
Here is how to explain to Tripwire what's important to you.
The Tripwire distribution includes several binaries, the corresponding
man pages and two files that regulate the program's behavior, which
we will call, for brevity, the Tripwire system files. The first one
(/etc/tripwire/twcfg.txt), where several variables are defined, is for
general configuration and even may be the same for all the computers
on the same LAN. Its contents go from the location of the Tripwire
database to instructions on minimizing the amount of time the passphrases
are kept in memory or the number of redundant reports.
</p><p>
Other important
parameters are the editor (the default is vi) for interactive usage and
how reports should be sent by e-mail. The complete syntax and meaning of
all possible variables is described in the twconfig man page.
</p><p>
The other
system file (/etc/tripwire/twpol.txt) contains the policy that declares
all the objects that must be monitored and what to do when one of them
is lost or altered. Unlike the configuration file, the policy could
(and almost certainly will) vary across the several computers on the
same network. For example, the packages installed on a firewall will be different
from those on a development workstation or an office laptop, even if
the same GNU/Linux distribution is used.
</p><p>
The first thing to do
to create a good Tripwire policy (and, in general, have a less stressful
sysadmin life) is to remove as many unneeded programs as possible before
starting. Next, to make your usage of Tripwire as quick and effective as
possible, your policy must cover everything you really need to monitor
and nothing else. This includes, at least, all the system binary and
library directories (that is, the contents of /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin,
/lib and so on) and the corresponding configuration files in /etc/. The
example twpol.txt files distributed with Tripwire contains
<span   class="emphasis"><em>anything</em></span> that
could be on a UNIX system, so it is guaranteed to complain about programs
that you never installed or placed in a different location. This is
an example of what you might see:

<pre     class="programlisting">
### Warning: File system error.
### Filename: /dev/cua0
### No such file or directory
### Continuing...
</pre>
</p><p>
There is a safe and easy way, even if potentially long and boring,
to remove such bogus warnings. Simply run the initial
configuration procedure described below several times. Scan the report
each time, and comment out the checks that generated false alarms until they all
disappear. Of course, before starting, do what should be done before
configuring any new package&mdash;that is, make a copy of the originals:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cp -p twcfg.txt twcfg.txt.orig
cp -p twpol.txt twpol.txt.orig
</pre>
</p><p>
A Tripwire policy is a sequence of two kind of rules. Normal ones
define which properties of a file or directory tree must be checked,
in this format:

<pre     class="programlisting">
object_name    -&gt;    property_mask (rule attribute = value);
</pre>
</p><p>
The property_mask specifies which properties must be examine or
ignored. Attributes provide additional, rule-specific information like
the rule severity or who should be informed by e-mail if that rule is
violated. The other kind of rules are stop points, which tell Tripwire not
to scan a particular file or directory. Tripwire also understands several
directives for conditional interpretation of the policy, diagnostics
and debugging. To know all the gory details, print out and study the
twpolicy man page.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2735580.0x282d8c8"></a>
Initial Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
After everything has been placed in the proper directories, either from
a binary package or compiling the sources, the first action to take as
root is to generate two robust&mdash;that is, hard to guess&mdash;passphrases. The
first one (site passphrase) is used to encrypt and sign the Tripwire
system files. The second one (local passphrase) is necessary
to launch the Tripwire binaries.
</p><p>
Theoretically, the Tripwire
distribution should include an /etc/tripwire/twinstall.sh script that
should prompt the user for passphrases and other information and then
perform all the steps below. At the time of this writing, both the
Tripwire 2.3.1 RPM package for Fedora Core 4 tested for this article
and several on-line tutorials still say to use that script, but it just
wasn't there after the installation. In any case, the utility that
performs these tasks is twadmin. Because it has a complete man page, and
it should be used anyway if you want to change keys after installation,
we just show how it works. The actions described above are executed
with the following commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
twadmin --generate-keys --site-keyfile my_home_key
 &#8618;--site-passphrase 'Hello <i  >LJ</i> readers'
twadmin --generate-keys --local-keyfile my_local_key
 &#8618;--local-passphrase 'Penguins are cool'
</pre>
</p><p>
This leaves the two keys encoded in the my_home_key and, respectively,
my_local_key files. Remember to copy these two names in the twcfg.txt
file <span   class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> running twadmin:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SITEKEYFILE	=/etc/tripwire/my_home_key
LOCALKEYFILE	=/etc/tripwire/my_local_key
</pre>
</p><p>
Once the passphrases have been stored, the configuration file must be
encrypted in this way:

<pre     class="programlisting">
twadmin --create-cfgfile --cfgfile twcfg.enc
 &#8618;--site-keyfile my_home_key twcfg.txt
Please enter your site passphrase:
Wrote configuration file: /etc/tripwire/twcfg.enc
</pre>
</p><p>
The procedure to create a binary version of the policy is similar:

<pre     class="programlisting">
twadmin --create-polfile --cfgfile twcfg.enc --polfile
 &#8618;twpol.enc --site-keyfile my_home_key twpol.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
The difference, with respect to the former command, is that now
the encrypted configuration file must be passed to twadmin. The reason
why the two files must be encrypted is that Tripwire will discover if they
are corrupted much more easily than if they were in plain-text format. In
order to directly read such files, you need (besides the passphrases,
obviously) the -print-cfgfile or --print-polfile options of twadmin.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2735580.0x282dd98"></a>
Database Creation</h2></div></div><p>
Once the passphrases and system files are all set, it's time to go into what
the documentation calls Database Initialization Mode:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tripwire --init --cfgfile twcfg.enc --polfile tw.pol
 &#8618;--site-keyfile my_home_key --local-keyfile my_local_key
</pre>
</p><p>
By default, the result is stored in
/var/lib/tripwire/YOURHOSTNAME.twd. Path and name can be changed in
twcfg.txt or given as a command-line option. Eventually, if everything
goes fine, you'll be greeted by this message:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Wrote database file: /var/lib/tripwire/YOURHOSTNAME.twd
The database was successfully generated
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2735580.0x282dfa8"></a>
Periodic Checks</h2></div></div><p>
As soon as encrypted system files, passphrases and a complete snapshot of your
system are available, Tripwire finally can do the only
thing we really care about&mdash;that is, to check the integrity
of our computers periodically. This is normally accomplished by running the program
as a cron job with this switch:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tripwire --check
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that, just to allow secure, automatic usage the program doesn't need
passphrases when launched in this way. Consequently, there is no need to
write them in plain text anywhere. The integrity report is printed
both to STDOUT (so it can be e-mailed to the system administrator) and saved
in the location specified by the REPORTFILE variable in the configuration
file. How often this operation should be performed depends on how
critical
the system is and how often it is exposed to external attacks. Although a corporate
firewall should be checked daily, a weekly check may be enough for a
department print server behind it or a regular desktop.
</p><p>
Figure 1 shows an example of what a Tripwire report looks like. It tells you,
for every rule defined in the policy, which of the corresponding files
were added, changed or modified. Command-line options are available to
check only specific sections of the policy file, or just some files. This
could be useful, for example, when nothing was modified in the system, but
there is the suspicion that some particular disc or partition was damaged.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8758f1.large.jpg"><img src="8758f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Sample Tripwire Report
</p></div></div><p>
The integrity checking procedure also can be interactive. Adding
the -interactive switch causes Tripwire to open an editor, after
the check, to allow the user to declare which files should be
permanently updated in the Tripwire database. This is a manual alternative
to the update mode described below.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2735580.0x282e3c8"></a>
Update Policies</h2></div></div><p>
Immediately after any system change, be it due to installation, update or
removal of software or configuration files, it is mandatory to update
the plain-text policy file and regenerate the binary database. Any
successive Tripwire check would be meaningless otherwise. Therefore,
run this command whenever it's necessary:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tripwire -update-policy -twrfile
 &#8618;a_previous_integrity_report.twr
</pre>
</p><p>
Because it is so critical, this operation requires both your local and site
passphrases. When launched in this way, Tripwire detects as violations
any changes that happened after the specified integrity check. In such a
case, an actual update of the policy, ignoring such violations, is
possible only if the user explicitly tells the program to run in low security
mode. The corresponding option is -Z low and is explained in detail
in the Tripwire man page.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2735580.0x282e580"></a>
Miscellaneous Tips and Tricks</h2></div></div><p>
Reading the twfiles and twintro man pages, which contain short and
up-to-date overviews of all the files and programs that compose the Tripwire
suite, is highly recommended before starting the installation. The
actual Tripwire binary, if called with the -help option, lists all
the available options. Like many FOSS programs, all the utilities of
this package accept both short and long forms of their command-line
options.
</p><p>
For example, <tt  >tripwire -check</tt> also can be written
as <tt  >tripwire
-m c</tt>. The second form is faster when one already knows Tripwire and has
to use it interactively, but the explicit command is recommended in scripts,
for documentation or didactical purposes. The -v option puts any Tripwire
command in verbose mode. Common wisdom also suggests that both the binary
and text versions of the Tripwire system files be stored on a separate
computer, write-protected floppy disk or USB drive.
</p><p>
Remember that one of
the first things a determined cracker will do is to replace just
<span   class="emphasis"><em>those</em></span>
files with her own copies, to hide any trace of attack. The periodical
reports placed by Tripwire in /var/lib/tripwire are in binary, optionally
signed format. Consequently, they can't be read straight from the
prompt, and they also can't even be processed directly by a shell script for
automatic comparison or other purposes. The solution is to use the twprint
command, which comes with its own complete man page, as in this example
(note that you must pass the binary configuration file for it to work):

<pre     class="programlisting">
twprint --print-report --cfgfile twcfg.enc --twrfile
 &#8618;/var/lib/tripwire/report/my_tripwire_report
</pre>
</p><p>
The digital signatures of each binary file can be checked directly with
the siggen utility, which also has its own man page:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/sbin/siggen /etc/tripwire/twcfg.enc
---------------------------------------------

Tripwire Competitors
</b></p><p>
Tripwire certainly isn't the only IDS solution for GNU/Linux
systems. Its more popular competitors are briefly described below. Other
similar packages in the same category are listed on a Purdue University
Web page (see the on-line Resources).
</p><p>
AIDE: the Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment is proposed as
a free software replacement for everything Tripwire does and then
some. The integrity database is defined by writing regular expressions
in the configuration file. Besides MD5, several other algorithms can be
added to verify file the integrity. Today, AIDE already supports sha1,
tormd160, tiger, haval and some others.
</p><p>
Tripwire for Servers: this is a proprietary product by Tripwire, Inc.,
the company created by the original Tripwire developers. It is targeted
at centralized monitoring of groups of Linux, UNIX or Windows servers.
</p><p>
Tripwire Enterprise: the flagship product of Tripwire, Inc., is for automated
monitoring of mixed networks of up to thousands of servers, desktops,
directory servers and network devices. Starting with version 5.2,
Tripwire Enterprise includes centralized management through a Web interface,
as well as customizable reporting and control.

Credits and a Glimpse of What's Ahead</h2></div></div><p>
The Open Source Tripwire Project had been quiescent for some
time. Luckily, just a few days before the deadline of this article,
version 2.4.0.1 was released on SourceForge, and it is the one you'll likely
find packaged for your distribution by the time you read this. Besides
the source tarball, it is also possible to download x86 static binaries
built on a Gentoo 2005 distribution. There are no remarkable changes
in functionality, so everything explained in this article should still
apply as is. The other good news is that this is the first release in
which
the old build system has been replaced by a standard autoconf/configure
environment. Unfortunately, due to some gcc 4 compatibility problems on
Fedora Core 4, it wasn't possible to test this version in time. However,
as soon as this porting is completed, it should be much easier to add
new features and package Open Source Tripwire for all modern GNU/Linux
distributions. You're welcome to join the effort and report bugs on
the developers mailing list (see Resources). Thanks to Paul Herman and
Ron Forrester for releasing this new version and the time they spent to
answer my questions.
