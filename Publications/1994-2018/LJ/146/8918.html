Red Hat Enterprise Server proves that less can be more, especially with
the help of well-implemented SELinux.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x173d580.0x18353a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This month, I conclude a three-part series on distribution-specific
security features. I began with SUSE Linux 10.0, continued on to Debian
GNU/Linux 3.1 and this month I discuss Red Hat Enterprise Linux
(RHEL) ES 4.
</p><p>
Red Hat Enterprise Linux is a general-purpose Linux distribution targeted
to both desktop and server markets. As the name implies, RHEL is intended
to be highly robust, stable and scalable; in other words, suitable for
production use across large enterprises. And, sure enough, RHEL enjoys
the reputation of delivering on all counts. Like SUSE, RHEL even runs
on IBM eServer z-Series mainframes.
</p><p>
To much greater degree than Debian, however, and to a significantly
greater degree than SUSE, Red Hat adheres to a strict philosophy of less
is more where bundled software packages are concerned. Whereas Debian
is composed of more than 15,000 packages and SUSE of more than 4,000, RHEL ES 4
weighs in at a mere 1,730 (if you include RHES Application Server and
Extras packages, which aren't part of the base OS, strictly speaking).
</p><p>
I don't think it's at all euphemistic to say that this is an
easily defended design choice. By limiting the number of packages it
officially supports, Red Hat has a much smaller attack surface (not
to mention help-desk surface). Fewer packages means less complexity;
less complexity means better stability and security (at least in theory).
</p><p>
The downside of this design philosophy is obvious. It means fewer choices in
any given tool space (network servers/d&aelig;mons, encryption tools and
so on),
less flexibility and greater likelihood that you'll end up installing
third-party packages or even compiling them yourself from source.
</p><p>
As I've said many times in this column, there's no harm in rolling your
own, especially when that means you're compiling out (excluding)
unnecessary or potentially insecure features. But, nothing beats
distribution-supported binary packages when it comes to automated security
updates. And, none of the major Linux distributions besides Gentoo has
any automated means of applying security patches directly from source
code to locally compiled software.
</p><p>
Furthermore, as I'm about to show, RHEL ES 4 is particularly thin in the
specific realms of security-enhancing software (with the sole exception
of SELinux) and security-scanning software. This doesn't mean that I
think RHEL is insecure; its smaller attack surface and its excellent
SELinux support are both highly significant. It does mean, however,
that you've got fewer choices in <span   class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> you secure your RHEL-based
server or desktop system, and even fewer choices in how you use it in
security applications, than is the case with other major distributions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x173d580.0x1835710"></a>
Installing RHEL ES 4</h2></div></div><p>
Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES 4 has a very easy-to-use installation GUI
that, besides installing the base operating system, allows you to select
additional software packages, set the root password, set up networking,
enable a simple local firewall policy and enable SELinux. After the
first reboot, this installer runs additional modules for setting up a
Red Hat Network subscription, creating the first nonroot user account
and configuring the X Window System.
</p><p>
Personally, I don't care for the Red Hat installer's software package
selection module at all. First, it allows you to select only from a
subset of the packages available on the installation medium. (That is,
as far as I could tell&mdash;it could simply be that a few packages I knew
were available but couldn't find, such as gnupg, were simply buried within
categories in which I didn't think to look). For the packages it does display,
the installer shows neither detailed descriptions nor even approximate
disk space required.
</p><p>
In addition, its dependency-checking functionality is decidedly
primitive.
If the software installer can't find something it needs, it returns an
error but doesn't give you any means of solving the problem (locating
the missing package, deselecting or uninstalling the package with
the unmet dependency and so on). Although simplicity may be a virtue, this
limited functionality doesn't compare very favorably at all with Debian's
aptitude package management tool or SUSE's YaST. If you want to run
this installer module again after installation is complete, it's located
in GNOME's Application menu under System Settings under Add/Remove
Applications, though I think you might be much happier performing
additional software installations using up2date or even good old RPM.
</p><p>
So, what security-related packages <span   class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> available in RHEL ES 4? Table
1 lists most of them. In a nutshell, if you want to secure the local
system, SELinux and your local firewall policy are very nearly the only
tools available to you. If you want to audit and analyze the security
of other systems, RHEL ES 4 has very little to offer besides Nmap.

On the face of it, this is a decent list of applications; these are all
important security-enhancing tools. Notably absent, however, are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Any sort of file-integrity checker, such as Tripwire or AIDE.
</p></li><li><p>
Syslog-NG, a much more powerful system logger than the archaic syslogd
on which RHEL still relies.
</p></li><li><p>
Any sort of virtualization environment (user-mode Linux, Bochs, Xen and
so on).
</p></li><li><p>
The ubiquitous intrusion detection system and packet-logger Snort.
</p></li><li><p>
Web security tools such as squidguard, mod_security and so on.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
You're perfectly free, of course, to download and compile the
source code of any of these tools manually. But, you won't be able to leverage
up2date's automatic update features on such packages.
</p><p>
So, both in terms of available security packages and the software installer
itself, RHEL is a bit underwhelming. On the plus side, I do like the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux installer's firewall/SELinux module (Figure
1). Both the firewall and SELinux functionality are enabled by default,
and the help window on the left-hand portion of the screen explains both
settings in plain language.
</p><p>
If you're completely new to SELinux, you can select a warn setting
that causes the kernel to log events that violate the local SELinux
policy without actually blocking those events. By default, however,
SELinux is set to active, using a default policy that restricts the
behavior of Apache (httpd), bind, NIS (ypbind), dhcpd, mysqld, ntpd,
portmap, postgresql, snmpd, squid and syslogd.

Figure 1. Firewall and SELinux Configuration in RHEL ES 4
</p></div></div><p>
The last thing worth noting about the Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES
4 installer is that both during initial setup, when you enter the root
password, and after the first reboot, when you create the first nonroot
user account, the installer performs no password complexity checks of any
kind (of the sort SUSE's installer performs). It doesn't even warn against
choosing an overly simple password via a simple text box like Debian does.
</p><p>
This is unfortunate. Password guessing and brute-force attacks are still
very much with us. I was pleased to see, however, that by default, the
XScreenSaver utility is configured to lock X sessions by
password automatically any time the screen saver kicks in. (If only those passwords that
protect XScreenSaver were required to include some combination of mixed
upper-/lowercase, punctuation and numerals, I'd be happier still!)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x173d580.0x182e410"></a>
Automated Updates with up2date</h2></div></div><p>
Keeping your system up to date with the latest security patches is
absolutely essential on any Linux system. Red Hat was a pioneer in
offering automatic updates when it introduced the combination of the
up2date utility and the Red Hat Network service offering several years
ago, and this system is even more mature now.
</p><p>
The way this works is that when you set up your Red Hat system (any
current version), after the first reboot you're prompted to configure
a Red Hat Network subscription. A subscription with an RHN Update
entitlement is included with every Red Hat product. When prompted, you
simply enter the user name and password you'd like to use (one account
can be used to manage multiple systems under the same subscription), and
then the subscription number printed on the Activate Your Subscription
card that came with your Red Hat installation media.
</p><p>
The net effect of all this (no pun intended) is that you now will have an
active subscription to the Red Hat Network service, with a system profile
corresponding to your new Red Hat system, which in turn is associated
with an RHN Update entitlement that allows your system to check for and
download the latest versions of all software packages that are part of
the version of RHEL you purchased.
</p><p>
The simplest way to check for and apply security updates is to right-click
the icon for the Red Hat Network Alert Notification Tool on your GNOME
desktop (it's a glowing red exclamation point if your system isn't up
to date, or a blue check mark if it is), and select Check for updates,
run up2date and so on, as needed.
</p><p>
You can set up automatic updates by logging on to the Red Hat Network
Web site (<a href="http://www.redhat.com/en_us/USA/rhn" target="_self">www.redhat.com/en_us/USA/rhn</a> for US users) with
your RHN credentials, clicking on the Systems tab, clicking on your
system's profile, clicking Properties and checking the box next to
Automatic application of relevant errata (Figure 2). Obviously, you
shouldn't enable this feature on high-availability or change-controlled
systems, because software patches always have the potential to introduce
other bugs or conflicts.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8918f2.large.jpg"><img src="8918f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Configuring Auto-Updates Via the RHN Web Site
</p></div></div><p>
Although the up2date/RHN system is mature and feature-rich (especially
for large organizations with the need and ability to pay for network
management and provisioning entitlements), as a Linux desktop user, I
find it more difficult to use than Debian's apt system (which is more primitive
in some ways, but easier to script) or SUSE's YaST Online Update system
(which is much easier to configure).
</p><p>
Oddly, as with many other aspects of RHEL, up2date configuration options
appear to be spread across multiple GUIs, including the Red Hat Network
Web site, unless of course you configure things from a shell (in which case
everything you need is in /etc/sysconfig). If you administer Red Hat on
servers (that may not even have the X Window System installed, which is always a
good policy on hardened systems) or are otherwise command-line-centric,
I'm sure up2date and other Red Hat functions are easy to learn.
Ironically, I find many of RHEL's GUIs, which are, of course, supposed
to simplify things, confusing. (But maybe it's just me!)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x173d580.0x182e938"></a>
SELinux on Red Hat Enterprise Linux</h2></div></div><p>
As we've seen, RHEL seems to rely very heavily on SELinux for system
security. This is hardly a sloppy or mentally lazy design choice; SELinux
provides a comprehensive and granular array of mandatory access controls
against system users, applications, processes and files. As described
in the previous section, the included targeted SELinux policy provides
default controls on some of the most commonly used applications.
</p><p>
This default policy's behavior can be tweaked easily using the Security
Level applet accessible via GNOME's Application&rarr;System Settings
menu (Figure 3). The same applet can be used to configure a simple local
firewall policy.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8918f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Security Level Configuration Applet
</p></div></div><p>
The implementation of SELinux in RHEL ES 4 is truly commendable for
its simplicity, not to mention the very fact that it's enabled by
default. That's the good news; the less-good news is that to create a
custom SELinux policy, that is, one that uses tighter or looser controls
than the included policy or one that addresses other applications,
you're going to have to do some reading. The best place to start is
the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Red Hat SELinux Guide, available at
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/enterprise/RHEL-4-Manual/selinux-guide" target="_self">www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/enterprise/RHEL-4-Manual/selinux-guide</a>.
</p><p>
You'll also probably want to install some extra GUI tools for this
purpose, too, namely the setools and setools-gui packages. These packages
provide, among other things, sepcut, apol, seaudit and seuserx. For
more information on what these tools do and how to use them, see the
documents in /usr/share/doc/setools-1.5.1 (the directory name on your
system may reflect a different version number).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x173d580.0x182ed58"></a>
Firewall Functionality in RHEL</h2></div></div><p>
I've already mentioned the Security Level applet in RHEL ES 4's GNOME
desktop. Unlike with SELinux, this applet doesn't give you much more
in the way of configuration options for the local firewall policy than
you get at installation time. This policy allows all outbound network
transactions (originating from the local system), and blocks all inbound
network transactions (destined for the local system) except the services
you select here. Those services are, as in the Red Hat installer, HTTP,
FTP, Telnet, mail (SMTP) and SSH.
</p><p>
In the Security Level applet, you also can specify a list of
other ports in the form [port #]:[protocol], for example
<tt  >689:tcp, 53:udp, 53:tcp</tt>. If you need anything fancier than
that, you have to write your own iptables statements from
scratch. Happily, you can do so simply by adding or editing lines
in the file /etc/sysconfig/iptables. See the iptables man page and
the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Security Guide for more information.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x173d580.0x182ef10"></a>
Directory Services and PKI</h2></div></div><p>
It's worth mentioning that Red Hat recently acquired Netscape
Directory Server, and has updated it and rebranded it as Red Hat
Directory Server. This is being positioned as a commercially supported
alternative to OpenLDAP or Sun Java System Directory Server. Although
not included with RHEL (it's an add-on product that costs extra), it's
worth mentioning as a key component of Red Hat's security vision. RHEL
does include fully supported OpenLDAP packages, however.
</p><p>
In the same vein, Red Hat Certificate System provides a
commercially supported PKI solution. It too is an add-on product not
included with RHEL. OpenSSL is included with RHEL, of course, but without
any additional setup tools such as TinyCA.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x173d580.0x182f070"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I have mixed feelings about Red Hat Enterprise ES 4's security
features. On the one hand, RHEL doesn't offer anywhere near as many
different security-enhancing software tools as Debian GNU/Linux or SUSE
Linux. Entire categories of security tools that are well represented in
other major Linux distributions (integrity checkers, intrusion detection
systems, virtualization environments and so on) are absent.
</p><p>
On the other hand, Red Hat has clearly maintained an unparalleled level
of control over the size and scope of its distribution. It has made hard
choices about what it will support and maintain, and what it will
not, which surely reduces the attack surface of Red Hat systems. I have
no doubt that Red Hat's security team has an easier time responding to
vulnerabilities in RHEL's 1,730 packages than the Debian security team
does with that distribution's 15,000-plus packages.
</p><p>
Furthermore, by not only including SELinux in RHEL 4 but enabling
it by default, Red Hat has taken a very bold step. The kernel-level
mandatory access controls provided by SELinux provide the potential to
mitigate many of the risks one might otherwise use add-on utilities
to address. Furthermore, because this sort of technology is proactive,
designed to prevent bad behavior, it's inherently stronger than intrusion
detection, integrity checking and other reactive technologies (though it
would be better if RHEL had <span   class="emphasis"><em>both</em></span> proactive and
reactive measures&mdash;even with SELinux, bad things can happen).
</p><p>
Whether you find RHEL to be lean and mean or limited and clunky will
depend on your particular Linux needs. I'll allow that some of the reasons
I'm not as keen on RHEL as I am on Debian and SUSE are specific to my job
as a security architect and consultant. I rely on a specialized set of
tools, most of which RHEL has judged to be unnecessary for its target
market&mdash;presumably IT professionals in corporate settings. Still, it
seems to me that if I needed to secure a corporate Web server running RHEL,
with or without SELinux, I'd still want to install mod_security,
Squidguard, Syslog-NG and other tools manually that RHEL presently lacks.
