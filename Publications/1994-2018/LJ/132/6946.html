Interrupts are how hardware gets
software's attention. Here's how they work.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x137e580.0x1476348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
A computer cannot meet its requirements unless
it communicates with its external devices. An
interrupt is a communication gateway between
the device and a processor. The allocation of
an interrupt request line for a device and how
the interrupt is handled play vital roles in device
driver development. As the number
of interrupt request lines in a system is limited,
sharing an interrupt between devices is a must to
access more devices. Any attempt to allocate an
interrupt already in use, however,
eventually crashes the system.
This article explains the basics
of the interrupt and the
fundamentals of interrupt handling and includes
an implementation of an interrupt request (IRQ) allocation for a
character device.
</p><p>
The purpose of any device is to do some useful
job, and to do so it should communicate with
the microprocessor. When a processor wants
to communicate with a device, it sends instructions to the device controller. A
device controller controls the operation of a
device. Similarly, if a device wants to reply to a
processor that says new data is ready to be retrieved, the devices
generate an interrupt to
capture the processor's attention. An interrupt
is a hardware mechanism that enables a device to
communicate with a processor.
</p><p>
Until version 2.6, Linux had been non-preemptive,
meaning that when a process is running in kernel
mode, if any higher-priority process arrives in the
ready-to-run queue, the lower-priority process
cannot be preempted until it returns to user mode.
But, an interrupt is allowed to divert CPU attention
even though it is executing a process in kernel
mode. This helps to improve the throughput of a
system. When an interrupt occurs, the CPU suspends
the current task and executes some other code,
which responds to whatever event caused the
interrupt.
</p><p>
Each device in a computer has a device controller,
and it has a hardware pin that is used to assert
when the device requires CPU service. This pin is attached
to the corresponding interrupt pin in the CPU,
which facilitates communication. The pin in the
processor connected to the controller is called
the interrupt request line. A CPU has several
such pins so that many devices can be serviced by
the processor. In a modern operating system, a
programmable interrupt controller (PIC) is used
to manage the IRQ lines between the processor
and the various device controllers. The number of
free IRQs in a system is restricted, but Linux has
a mechanism to allow many pieces of hardware to
share the same interrupts.
</p><p>
Interrupt servicing can be compared to
a programmer's job. The programmer opens
a mailbox and does his routine programming
work. When new mail arrives, he is
interrupted by a beep
or by some other notification at the corner of the
screen. Immediately, he saves the program
and switches over to the mailbox. He then reads
the mail, sends an acknowledgement and resumes
his earlier work. A detailed reply
listing the steps he has taken
is sent later.
</p><p>
Similarly, when a CPU executes a process, a device
can send an interrupt to the CPU regarding some
task, for example, data is ready for transfer. When
an interrupt comes, the CPU instantly saves the
current value of the program counter in the kernel
mode stack and executes the corresponding interrupt
service routine (ISR). An ISR is a function
situated in the kernel that determines the nature
of the interrupt and performs whatever actions
are needed, such as moving a block of data from hard
disk to main memory. After executing the ISR, the CPU resumes the
earlier process and executes.
</p><p>
A device driver is
a software module in the kernel
that waits for requests from the application
program. Whenever an application wants to read
data from a device, the corresponding
device driver is invoked immediately, and the respective
device is open for reading.
If the system is waiting for slow hardware,
it cannot do any useful job. One of the prime
aims of kernel developers is to utilize
system resources effectively.
To avoid waiting
for data from the hardware, the kernel gives
this job to the device controller and resumes
the stopped process. When reading completes, the
device notifies the CPU through an interrupt.
The processor then executes the corresponding ISR.

Interrupt Classification</h2></div></div><p>
Interrupts are divided into two broad categories,
synchronous and asynchronous. Synchronous
interrupts are generated by the CPU control unit
when it is executing an instruction. The control
unit issues an interrupt after terminating
the instructions, hence the name synchronous
interrupt. Asynchronous interrupts are created by
hardware devices at random times with respect to
the CPU clock. In the Intel context,
the first one is called exceptions
and the second is interrupts.
Interrupt is identified by an unsigned one-byte
integer called a vector. The vector ranges
between 0 to 255. The first 32 (0&ndash;31) vectors
are exceptions and non-maskable interrupts, which
was explained in my article &ldquo;Linux Signals for the Application
Programmer&rdquo;, <i  >LJ</i>, March 2003. The range
from 32&ndash;47 is assigned to maskable interrupts and
is generated by IRQs (0&ndash;15 IRQ line numbers).
The last
range, from 48&ndash;255, is used to identify software
interrupts; an example of this is interrupt 128
(int 0X80 assembly instructions), which is used
to implement system calls.

IRQ Allocation</h2></div></div><p>
A snapshot of interrupts already in use on
the system is stored in the /proc directory. The
<tt  >$cat /proc/interrupt</tt> command displays the data
related to the interrupts. The
following output was displayed on my machine:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CPU0
  0:   82821789          XT-PIC  timer
  1:        122          XT-PIC  i8042
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  8:          1          XT-PIC  rtc
 10:     154190          XT-PIC  eth0
 12:        100          XT-PIC  i8042
 14:      21578          XT-PIC  ide0
 15:         18          XT-PIC  ide1
NMI:          0
ERR:          0
</pre>
</p><p>
The first column is the IRQ line (vector ranges from 32&ndash;47), and the next
column is the number of times the interrupts are delivered in the CPU after
booting the system. The third column is related to the
PIC, and the last column is the list of the device
names that have registered handlers for the corresponding interrupt.
</p><p>
The simplest way to load a device driver
dynamically is first to find the unused IRQ line in the system. A request_irq function
is used to allocate a specified IRQ line number for a device. The syntax
for the request_irq follows and is declared in linux/sched.h:

<pre     class="programlisting">
int
request_irq (unsigned int irq,
             void (*handler) (int, void *,
                              struct pt_regs *),
             unsigned long flags,
             const char *device, void *dev_id);
</pre>
</p><p>
The details of the arguments in this function are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
unsigned int irq: interrupt number, which we want to request from the system.
</p></li><li><p>
void (*handler) (int, void *, struct pt_regs *): whenever an interrupt
is generated, we have to write ISRs to handle the interrupt;
otherwise, the processor simply acknowledges it and does nothing else
for that interrupt. This argument is the pointer to the handler function.
The syntax for the handler function is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
void
handler (int irq, void *dev_id,
         struct pt_regs *regs);
</pre>
</p><p>
The first argument is the IRQ number, which we
already have mentioned in the request_irq function.
The second argument is a device identifier,
using major and minor numbers to identify which
device is in charge of the current interrupt
event. The third argument is used to save
the process' context in the kernel stack before
the processor starts executing the interrupt
handler function. This structure is used when
the system resumes the execution of the earlier
process. Normally, device driver writers need not
worry about this argument.
</p></li><li><p>
unsigned long flags: the flags variable is used for
interrupt management. The SA_INTERRUPT flag is set
for fast interrupt handler, and it disables all the
maskable interrupt. SA_SHIRQ is set when we want to
share the irq with more than one device, SA_PROBE
is set if we are interested in probing a hardware
device using the IRQ line, and SA_RANDOM is used to seed
the kernel random number generator. For more details of
this flag, see /usr/src/linux/drivers/char/random.c.
</p></li><li><p>
constant char *device: a device name that holds the IRQ.
</p></li><li><p>
void *dev_id: the device identifier&mdash;it's a pointer to the device
structure.
When the interrupt is shared, this field points to the particular device.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The request_irq function returns 0 on success and -EBUSY when the
allocation has failed. EBUSY is the error number of 16, which is
described in the /usr/src/linux/include/asm/errno.h file. The free_irq
function releases the IRQ number from the device. The syntax for
this function is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
free_irq (unsigned int irq, void *dev_id);
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x137e580.0x1477058"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The explanation for the arguments is the same as above.
</p><p>
An ISR is invoked whenever an interrupt
occurs. The operations to be performed on the
cause of the interrupt are described in the
ISR. The kernel maintains a table in memory, which
contains the addresses of the interrupt routines
(interrupt vectors). When an interrupt occurs,
the processor checks the address of the ISR in the
interrupt vector table and then executes. The task of
the ISR is to react to the device according to the
nature of the interrupt, such as read or write data. Typically, the ISR
wakes up sleeping processes
on the device if the interrupt signals
the event for which they are waiting.
</p><p>
The amount of time the processor takes to respond to
an interrupt is called interrupt latency. Interrupt
latency is composed of hardware propagation time,
register saving time and software propagation time.
Interrupt latency should be minimal to improve
the system's performance; for this reason, the ISR should
be short and disable interrupts only for a brief
time. Other
interrupts can occur while interrupts are disabled, but the processor does not
allow them until interrupts are re-enabled. If more
than one interrupt is blocked, the processor
allows them in priority order when it is ready
for interrupt service.
</p><p>
Device driver developers should disable
interrupts in driver code only when
necessary, because the system does not update
the system timers, transfer network packets to and
from buffers and so on during the interrupt disabling.
Driver developers should write ISRs
to release the processor for other tasks.
In real-world scenarios, however, ISRs handle lengthy tasks. In such
situations, the ISR
can do only the time-critical communication with
the hardware to disable the interrupt and use
the tasklet to perform most of the actual data
transfer processing. The tasklet is
the advanced feature in the latest Linux kernel
that does certain operations related to the
interrupt during safe times. The tasklet is the
software interrupt, and it can be interrupted by
other interrupts. The internals of the interrupts
have been explained in detail by Bovet and Cesati (see the on-line Resources),
and the implementation of the interrupts in
device driver perspective is presented by Rubini and
Corbet (see Resources).

Simple Implementation</h2></div></div><p>
Any kernel module includes a device driver that can
be loaded with the existing kernel, even when the
system is running. I explain the basic dynamic
IRQ allocation procedure in a simple module shown in Listing 1. The
following simple character device driver code
describes the dynamic allocation of an IRQ line for
a device named OurDevice. When you insert
the module, the init_module function is executed.
If it is allocated successfully, an unused major
number and register for the given IRQ number for the
device and the corresponding printk message
then is printed. From here, we could check the IRQ allocation
in the /proc directory. The given IRQ is
released at the time the module is removed. The
best place to register an IRQ number is an open
entry point of a driver code, which subsequently
frees the IRQ in a release function.

The my_module.c file is compiled with the 2.6.0-0.test2.1.29 kernel. The
kernel-2.6.0-0.test2.1.30.i586.rpm was downloaded along with all
the dependent RPMs and installed. The RPM was downloaded from
 <a href="http://people.redhat.com/arjanv/2.5/RPMS.kernel" target="_self">people.redhat.com/arjanv/2.5/RPMS.kernel</a>, and the device driver
program was compiled as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -Wall -O3 -finline-functions \
-Wstrict-prototypes -falign-functions=4 \
-I/lib/modules/2.6.0-0.test2.1.29/build/include \

</pre>
</p><p>
After inserting my_module.o, if the major
number and the IRQ allocation for the device are
successful, the corresponding printk statement
output can be seen. If the IRQ number
already is in use by another device, the kernel
unregisters the device and releases the major
number. The <tt  >$cat /proc/interrupt</tt> command displays
the following output:

<pre     class="programlisting">

An entry of OurDevice along with the IRQ line can
be seen in the output. When we remove the module,
the kernel frees the IRQ number, unregisters
the device and releases the major number.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Hopefully, this article makes clear the fundamental
concepts of interrupts and the interrupt handling
routine. The discussion of the request_irq and
free_irq function is useful when we use these concepts
in device drivers. The dynamic IRQ allocation procedure
has been explained with the simple character device
driver code.
