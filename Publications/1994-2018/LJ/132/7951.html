<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #132, April 2005</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

The revision control wars have not cooled down, but
they have gone fairly quiet. For the most part, this
is because <span   class="bold"><b>BitKeeper</b></span> works much better than any
free alternative, and feature requests from kernel
folks are given top priority for development. In
November 2004, only twice did the possibility of an
alternative come up on the linux-kernel mailing
list. The first time, <span   class="bold"><b>Andrea Arcangeli</b></span> once
again presented <span   class="bold"><b>tla</b></span>, also known as arch, and
although it did seem that various other developers
also had been keeping an eye on that tool, the consensus
was that tla was not yet scalable enough for the
kernel.
</p><p>
Later on, in a completely different discussion, the
<span   class="bold"><b>darcs</b></span> revision control tool came up.
<span   class="bold"><b>David
Roundy</b></span>, its maintainer, announced a darcs mirror
of the kernel repository. This is a holy grail among
revision control systems, because even a mirror of the
kernel history is a very large and difficult hurdle.
For now, BitKeeper is still in the far lead.
</p><p>
It's always great to see documentation.
<span   class="bold"><b>Alexander Viro</b></span> recently wrote a HOWTO for
<span   class="bold"><b>cross-compilation</b></span>. According to him, it's neither
difficult nor time consuming to compile a kernel
on one architecture, for use on another, and he
typically tests all his changes for compile errors on
builds for six different architectures: i386, x86_64,
sparc32, sparc64, alpha and ppc. <span   class="bold"><b>Geert
Uytterhoeven</b></span>
had some patches to help extend this to the
m68k architecture as well, but this may be put off
for a while, because currently the m68k architecture
is not so well supported by the official kernel
sources. Several hard-core problems confront the
developers, for which no solutions have yet been
found.
</p><p>
The 2.6 kernel development model continues to undergo
transformations and clarifications under the <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds/Andrew Morton</b></span> maintainership duo. The new
<span   class="bold"><b>Signed-off-by</b></span> tag, for instance, develops new
wrinkles over time. Linus recently clarified that if
patches are passed back and forth between developers,
it is better for developers to move their
Signed-off-by tag to the top, rather than have
multiple copies reflecting each contribution they
made. He also suggests including a CC list within each
changelog entry, although he says this is unofficial,
for informational purposes only, and has no technical
protocol to follow. We'll see how long that lasts.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, a whole bunch of developers is unhappy
that, as <span   class="bold"><b>Adrian Bunk</b></span> has said, &ldquo;2.6 is currently more
a development kernel than a stable kernel.&rdquo; These
folks feel that a 2.7 development kernel should be
forked off as soon as possible, and 2.6 should be
allowed to stabilize. Although development is definitely
more fun than maintenance, <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span> has made multiple
offers to take over 2.6 maintainership, and he is
known for giving a lot of weight to stability in
his patches. His 2.6-ac patch series is currently
the preferred source tree of a significant number of
kernel developers. So far, neither Linus nor Andrew
has shown any sign of handing 2.6 off to Alan or
slowing down their pace of development. If anything,
2.6 development speed is only increasing at this time.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, Linus continues to refine his version
numbering habits in response to recent criticism. His
current thinking is that, for the 2.6 series, all
pre-releases will be tagged rc, the latest being
2.6.10-rc3. This has the virtue of simplicity, which
also motivated his decision in the 2.5 time frame
to drop the -pre and -rc tags entirely and
release full 2.5.x versions each time. Given the
relaxation of the stable/development alternation,
we'll have to see whether the 2.5 standard persists
into 2.7. For the moment, the only point of clarity
with regard to the kernel development model is that
there is no clarity. The Linux development model
is being explored, revised, carved up and mutilated&mdash;however it ends
up, it clearly will be different from
what it was before.
</p><p>
The 2.4 kernel continues to struggle toward
stability. <span   class="bold"><b>Marcelo Tosatti</b></span> has revised his goals many
times, ranging from total lock-down, to accepting
certain important new features while rejecting
everything else, to having a more relaxed acceptance
policy in general. Ever since 2.6 came out, he has
been trying to put 2.4 into deep-freeze, but with
no 2.7 anywhere on the horizon, it becomes harder to
reject features from 2.4. There are always folks who
need 2.4's stability, with more up-to-date features;
and so more and more features are backported from
2.6, and these continue to try to find their way into
the official 2.4 source tree.
</p><p>
Recently, the <span   class="bold"><b>Device Mapper</b></span> subsystem was thoroughly
rejected, as being too invasive for inclusion in 2.4
under any circumstances, and <span   class="bold"><b>iswraid</b></span>, on the other
hand (with some bumps along the way), made it in under
the wire. After 2.4.28, Marcelo made another valiant
attempt to batten down the hatches, although, as he
put it, &ldquo;New drivers are okay, as long as they don't
break existing setups and if a substantial amount
of users will benefit from it.&rdquo; In particular, new
drivers should be reviewed by someone knowledgeable
in a specific area, he said.

On-line games need bleeding-edge client-side software
with 3-D graphics, an enormous back-end server farm
and stiff subscription charges, right?
</p><p>
More than 100,000 people beg to differ. For the
LAMP issue, here's a surprise hit on the on-line
gaming scene, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Kingdom of Loathing</em></span>. The
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Kingdom</em></span> is a Web-based adventure game that combines the
problem solving of classic text adventures with the
emergent economics and politics of Internet gaming
and stick-figure graphics. It's hosted on Linux.
</p><p>
Don't expect your standard sword-and-sorcery or
space-war plot though. Start off slaying cans of
tomatoes and asparagus in the Haunted Pantry and
work your way up to beating down Orcish Frat Boys,
hippie chefs and other monsters. Sell your extra
loot in the Flea Market or the Mall. There's even
an Internet radio station where you can win in-game
prizes. It's free of charge, but we highly recommend
that you donate $10 to get a powerful magic item.

In this issue's Paranoid Penguin column, Mick Bauer reviews
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Islands in the Clickstream: Reflections on Life in a Virtual
World</em></span>, a book by Richard Thieme that explores some of the
philosophical questions and issues that have arisen as our daily lives
become more and more entwined with modern technology. Mick had the
opportunity to interview Richard about some of the themes in his book;
the transcript of their conversation is available <a href="../000/7934.html" target="_self">here</a>.
 They discuss
language, video games and Richard's religious background as a backdrop
for considering some of the questions about the intersection of humanity
and technology.

I think, fundamentally, open source does tend to
be more stable software. It's the right way to do
things. I compare it to science vs. witchcraft. In
science, the whole system builds on people looking at
other people's results and building on top of them. In
witchcraft, somebody had a small secret and guarded
it&mdash;but never allowed others to really understand
it and build on it.
</p><p>
Traditional software is like witchcraft. In history,
witchcraft just died out. The same will happen in
software. When problems get serious enough, you can't
have one person or one company guarding their secrets.
You have to have everybody share in knowledge.

If the idea of an up-to-date GNOME desktop environment
on top of an administrator-friendly Debian base
sounds good to you, then burn a Ubuntu install CD
and give it a try.
</p><p>
Ubuntu's main strong point is a thundering herd of
well-informed, helpful early adopters. As I write
this in December 2004, the Linux Web sites and mailing
lists are buzzing with Ubuntu questions and answers.
</p><p>
In the current Warty Warthog release, hardware
autodetection is a notch behind the current champ,
SuSE Linux Professional. Ubuntu didn't get the USB
Wacom tablet or set up both heads of the dual-head
video card on one test system. It did fine on a
more generic PC.
</p><p>
Ubuntu won't try to wow you with a flashy install,
so be patient through its text-based, competent first
impression. When the desktop comes up, you'll get
no surprise, just the same Mozilla Firefox/Novell
Evolution/OpenOffice.org setup that's become the
desktop Linux standard. Fans of KDE applications, such
as the Konqueror file manager/Web browser and the k3b
CD burner, will have to do some extra tweaks, though.
</p><p>
The Synaptic package manager, from Debian, is easier
to use than other distributions' tools for updating
software. You can get anybody started using the
standard GUI apps on Linux, but Ubuntu's thoughtful
choices make it easier to teach new users how to
install new software.
</p><p>
The simplicity makes this a great distribution to
carry around for lack-of-Linux emergencies you may
encounter at other people's homes and businesses.
When the local coffeehouse had a problem with spyware
on a legacy OS running on the computer for customers,
I put Ubuntu on there and gave the manager a quick
tutorial. After the install, the one issue requiring
a Web search to resolve was setting up printing to
a printer connected to a Microsoft Windows machine.
</p><p>
Because you probably know what Firefox, Evolution and
OpenOffice.org look like by now, here's Anna Goldberg,
age 5, learning TuxPaint.

Mozilla Firefox supports easy-to-install extensions,
and one of the most useful is Chris Pederick's Web
Developer Extension, which brings together many
Webmasters' ideas for viewing and testing a site's
look and functionality. For example, you can display
all classes and IDs, as shown here, to make it easy
to work on your stylesheet without viewing source on
the HTML. You also can clear out cookies and HTTP
authentication for your site to start a new
session easily or run the W3C validator on the current page.
You even can sanity-check tables with a temporary
border without changing the HTML or the CSS.
