<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #132, April 2005</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span>
are still trying to find the best way to continue
developing Linux. With the death of the idea of a
stable/unstable series, there is still a push toward
stability for each actual point release, such as 2.6.9
and 2.6.10. However, many users are reluctant to test
the 2.6 kernels because of the tremendous amount
of development going into them. Linus, Andrew and
others have been giving thought to how to attract more
testers to the now unpredictable official tree. One
idea has been to bring back the stable/unstable
concept for alternating versions. So 2.6.11 would be
a stabilization kernel, with only bug-fixes for a couple
of months, while 2.6.12 would be a new-feature kernel
for a couple months, and so on. Another possibility
would be to add a fourth number to the version, with numbers like
2.6.11.2 and 2.6.11.3, and these releases would be
used for bug-fixes, while more development takes place
on 2.6.12. So far nothing is certain, and Linus and
Andrew are still trying to figure out the impact of
abandoning the original stable/unstable development
system. Stay tuned.
</p><p>
An interesting copyright question arose when
<span   class="bold"><b>Adrian Bunk</b></span> noticed that <span   class="bold"><b>ReiserFS</b></span> files
included a notice implicitly transferring copyright
of all additions to <span   class="bold"><b>Hans Reiser</b></span>. The
authors
of the code explicitly could retain copyright by
including text with their contributions, but Adrian
felt there was something fishy about it. Linus
Torvalds has given his support to Hans' copyright
handling, and Hans himself also makes a point of
asking all contributors directly, for the copyright
assignment. According to Hans, the text is only in
the source files in order to cover his backside
from the likes of <span   class="bold"><b>The SCO Group</b></span>. And as
<span   class="bold"><b>Christoph Hellwig</b></span> has pointed out,
<span   class="bold"><b>SGI</b></span>
makes the same request for copyright assignment from
anyone contributing to the <span   class="bold"><b>XFS</b></span> filesystem. With
precedent, politeness and an affirmation from the
top Linux dog, it's possible this practice may spread
to other areas of the kernel as well.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Marcus Metzler</b></span> noticed that <span   class="bold"><b>iRiver</b></span> had
released a binary-only product based on Linux
and had refused to release any source code along
with it. They certainly have made no secret of the
fact that their multimedia player is Linux-based in
their publicity and manuals, but no copy of the GPL,
nor any offer to provide sources, have been found on
their site or in their product.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>SquashFS</b></span> compressed filesystem hovers on the brink of acceptance into
the official kernel tree. <span   class="bold"><b>Phillip
Lougher</b></span>'s code is self-contained,
functional and clean. Folks like <span   class="bold"><b>Greg
Kroah-Hartman</b></span> have been urging him to
submit the code, but Phillip is reluctant. He has many new features
to add, and whether it would be best to implement these before or after
acceptance into the official kernel is not clear to him. I think it is a
safe bet that SquashFS will have no trouble getting into 2.6, whenever
Phillip decides the time is right. The kernel dudes eagerly await his
submission.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>FUSE</b></span>, on the other hand, a user-space filesystem
actively trying to be accepted into the main
kernel tree, is running into serious problems. Linus
Torvalds, in particular, believes that filesystems simply are
not supposed to be user-space creatures. Divorcing
a filesystem from the kernel, he says, is the same as
microkernels' attempt to split the guts of a system
into discrete pieces. For the same reason that Linus
believes in a monolithic kernel structure, he believes
that a user-space filesystem is a bad idea. On the
other hand, Linus has said he'd be willing to accept
FUSE, with a restricted feature set, if it avoided
certain ugly behaviors that he feels should not be
the province of a user-space filesystem anyway. He
had a similar set of restrictions with <span   class="bold"><b>DevFS</b></span>
long ago. The DevFS situation turned into a mess,
partly because the /dev directory is so central to
Linux. A single filesystem probably will be nowhere
near as controversial.

<h2 class="title">A Hot New Linux PXA</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #132, April 2005</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

The coolest Linux product I saw at CES 2005 (the giant Consumer
Electronics Show in Las Vegas&mdash;for more, see Linux for Suits on page
46) was the new Archos PMA430 Pocket Media Assistant. Because you can
stick just about any noun you want between &ldquo;Personal&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Assistant&rdquo;,
let's call it a PXA. It's less than an inch thick, 3.1" wide, 4.9"
long and just under 10 ounces.
</p><p>
Because it's Linux, open source and a member of nobody's media management
silo, it's free to do all kinds of stuff that Apple, Sony and other
handheld makers with lock-in agendas will never support on their own
devices. For example, it will <span   class="emphasis"><em>record</em></span> digital audio as well as play it
back, which it can do in Ogg Vorbis as well as MP3 and other formats. It
will record and play back digital video (MPEG-4 SP on a 3.5" 320x240
screen). It's a full-featured PDA, using Qtopia software, and a photo
viewer with a 30GB hard drive that also serves as a peripheral storage
volume through USB 2 or USB 1. It has ten hours of battery life playing
audio and about half that playing video. It runs games. It has built-in
Wi-Fi and an Opera browser. Best of all, it's open to anything written
for its Linux OS. To that end, the company plans to have a
software development kit released by the time you read this.

Everyone likes a nice game of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tetris</em></span> every now
and then, but what about an evil game of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tetris</em></span>?
Frederico Poloni's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bastet</em></span>, short for Bastard
Tetris, is a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tetris</em></span> clone that picks the worst
possible piece to fit into your stack. It's based
on <span   class="emphasis"><em>petris</em></span> by Peter Seidler and has a lean, mean
interface. No music and no fancy graphics, only the
bastard AI and you.

Whether you're working on your <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tetris</em></span> game and hoping
to go pro, celebrating the 20th anniversary of the
original <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tetris</em></span>, or simply looking for an implementation
that will make you lose and get you back to work
sooner, this is a game to try.

<h2 class="title">On the Web</h2>
<div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>Being a publication ourselves and a part of a company that has
published books, magazines and Web sites, we're always interested in
what is happening in the world of publishing. Based on the following Web
articles, available on the <i  >Linux Journal</i> Web site,
one of the newest trends is moving publications toward an open-source
model:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
This issue's EOF discusses how the open-source paradigm is being applied
to scientific publishing to encourage equal access to information
published in scientific journals. Author Christopher Frenz explains how
this growing movement led to the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
asking that published research results funded by NIH be released without
cost after a period of six months. In his Web follow-up article, &ldquo;Voice
Your Opinion to the NIH&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8061" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8061</a>), Frenz
outlines how you can let the NIH know your thoughts about open access
for science.
</p></li><li><p>
As Clay Dowling explains, however, open-source publishing models are not
being investigated and used only for science. &ldquo;Publishing Open-Source
Documents with Open-Source Tools&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8062" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8062</a>) describes the entirely
open-source process and tools used to produce <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Shadow of
Yesterday</em></span>, written by Clinton Nixon of Anvilwerks (<a href="http://www.anvilworks.com" target="_self">www.anvilworks.com</a>). Dowling and Nixon also discuss
&ldquo;the
practical business impact of publishing an open-source document with
open-source tools&rdquo;.

<h2 class="title">Do-It-Ourselves Media</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #132, April 2005</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

Take Creative Commons, Internet Archive, podcasting and the video edge
of the blogging movement; then, combine it with a do-it-ourselves
attitude. The result is ourmedia, which founder J.D. Lasica (author of
the new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Darknet</em></span>) calls &ldquo;an all-volunteer, open-source media
project&rdquo;. Or, in the words of its slogan, &ldquo;The Global Home for
Grassroots Media&rdquo;.
</p><p>
ourmedia is an excellent example of non-programmers and programmers
getting together and creating a new infrastructure that's based on
open-source principles and attracts the participation of both open-source
programmers and free-range digital creators of all types.
</p><p>
Marc Canter, perhaps best known as the driving force behind Macromind, which later became Macromedia, is another of the leading figures in
ourmedia. His company is Broadband Mechanics, which also is involved
with ourmedia. Marc says, &ldquo;Our business model is to help create and
promulgate new standards&mdash;and then build on top of them.&rdquo; Other
partners in the project are Bryght, Creative Commons, Wikipedia and The
Internet Archive.
</p><p>
He also draws a distinction between standards based on companies and
those based on independent open-source efforts that operate outside any
company's platform-based silo. &ldquo;If Google, eBay and Amazon can be
infrastructure for Web 2.0, why can't we build our
<span   class="emphasis"><em>own</em></span> infrastructure?
This is just one of the first of many projects.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The site is Drupal on Linux, naturally. ourmedia volunteer programmers
are leveraging other open-source tools to make it easy for nontechnical
folks to upload and share their works in the free (as in beer and
speech) and wide-open spaces provided by the Internet Archive.
</p><p>
According to cofounder Marc Canter, the first handy hack uses Python
to build an uploading tool based on Creative Commons' The Publisher, a
graphical desktop application that attaches licenses to audio
and video files and uploads them to the Internet Archive. &ldquo;We're taking
the source for that tool and extending the metadata to all media types,
not just audio and video. And we're pointing it to the ourmedia
collection, where each file will have its own location and will be easy
for anybody to find as soon as it's up there. Everybody will also have
their own ourmedia page, with a listed history of every file they've
published, ready for Creative Commons-licensed use. This makes them a)
part of a community and b) able to keep track of the files they've published
and show that list of published stuff to others.&rdquo;
</p><p>
He adds, &ldquo;Of course you can still ftp to the same directory, but how
many artist types will know how to do that? This tool will let the
artist upload large files directly without going through HTTP.&rdquo;

Kurt Reisler wrote that the Digital user group DECUS
was planning a half-day seminar led by Linus Torvalds
at its May 1995 conference, plus a full day of other
Linux activities. Looking forward to the Digital
Alpha port of Linux, he wrote, &ldquo;Imagine your Linux
system running at 300+ MIPS.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The transition from a.out to ELF shared libraries was
in progress, and the issue covered both. Eric Kasten
wrote a shared library tutorial, including how to
create the then-current a.out format. &ldquo;The current
a.out shared libraries will probably need to be
supported for some time&rdquo;, he wrote. Meanwhile Eric
Youngdale contributed an introduction to ELF,
including the reasons we were all switching to ELF.
</p><p>
Joesph Brothers wrote a tour of hardware architectures
with Linux ports. At the time, only x86, Motorola
68k and Alpha would run a shell. Others in progress
were MIPS, SPARC and PowerPC. Alpha was the BogoMips
champion at 149.49. The &ldquo;bogo-fastest&rdquo; x86 listed
was a 486DX4/100 at 50.08.

Pacific Hi-Tech advertised the &ldquo;Linux Run-Time System
1.0&rdquo;, a live CD distribution that booted and ran
without installing to the hard drive, for $29.95 US.
