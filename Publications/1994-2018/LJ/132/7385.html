Save a lot of typing with these handy bash features you won't find in
an old-fashioned UNIX shell.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d74580.0x1e6c298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
bash, or the Bourne again shell, is the default shell in most Linux
distributions. The popularity of the bash shell amongst Linux and UNIX
users is no accident. It has many features to enhance user-friendliness
and productivity. Unfortunately, you can't take advantage of those
features unless you know they exist.
</p><p>
When I first started using Linux, the only bash feature I took advantage
of was going back through the command history using the up arrow. I soon
learned additional features by watching others and asking questions. In
this article, I'd like to share some bash tricks I've learned over
the years.
</p><p>
This article isn't meant to cover all of the features of the bash shell;
that would require a book, and plenty of books are available that
cover this topic, including <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning the bash
Shell</em></span> from O'Reilly and
Associates. Instead, this article is a summary of the bash tricks I use
most often and would be lost without.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d74580.0x1e6c4a8"></a>
Brace Expansion</h2></div></div><p>
My favorite bash trick definitely is brace expansion. Brace expansion
takes a list of strings separated by commas and expands those strings
into separate arguments for you. The list is enclosed by braces, the
symbols { and }, and there should
be no spaces around the commas. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo {one,two,red,blue}
one two red blue
</pre>
</p><p>
Using brace expansion as illustrated in this simple example doesn't
offer too much to the user. In fact, the above example requires
typing two more characters than simply typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo one two red blue
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d74580.0x1e6c6b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which produces the same result. However, brace expansion becomes quite
useful when the brace-enclosed list occurs immediately before, after
or inside another string:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo {one,two,red,blue}fish
onefish twofish redfish bluefish

$ echo fish{one,two,red,blue}
fishone fishtwo fishred fishblue

$ echo fi{one,two,red,blue}sh
fionesh fitwosh firedsh fibluesh
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that there are no spaces inside the brackets or between the
brackets and the adjoining strings. If you include spaces, it breaks
things:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo {one, two, red, blue }fish
{one, two, red, blue }fish

$ echo "{one,two,red,blue} fish"
{one,two,red,blue} fish
</pre>
</p><p>
However, you can use spaces if they're enclosed in quotes outside the
braces or within an item in the comma-separated list:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo {"one ","two ","red ","blue "}fish
one fish two fish red fish blue fish

$ echo {one,two,red,blue}" fish"
one fish two fish red fish blue fish
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can nest braces, but you must use some caution here too:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo {{1,2,3},1,2,3}
1 2 3 1 2 3

$ echo {{1,2,3}1,2,3}
11 21 31 2 3
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, after all these examples, you might be thinking to yourself, &ldquo;Gee,
those are great parlor tricks, but why should I care about brace
expansion?&rdquo;
</p><p>
Brace expansion becomes useful when you need to make a backup of a
file. This is why it's my favorite shell trick. I use it almost every day
when I need to make a backup of a config file before changing it. For
example, if I'm making a change to my Apache configuration, I can do
the following and save some typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cp /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf{,.bak}
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that there is no character between the opening brace and the first
comma. It's perfectly acceptable to do this and is useful when adding
characters to an existing filename or when one argument is a substring
of the other.
Then, if I need to see what changes I made later in the day, I use the
diff command and reverse the order of the strings inside the braces:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ diff /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf{.bak,}
1050a1051
&gt; # I added this comment earlier
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d74580.0x1e6cc38"></a>
Command Substitution</h2></div></div><p>
Another bash trick I like to use is command substitution. To use command
substitution, enclose any command that generates output to standard
output inside parentheses and precede the opening parenthesis with a
dollar sign, <tt  >$(command)</tt>.
Command substitution is useful when assigning a value to a variable. This
is typical in shell scripts, where a common operation is to assign the
date or time to a variable. It also is handy for using the output of
one command as an argument to another command.
If you want to assign the date to a variable, you can do this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ date +%d-%b-%Y
12-Mar-2004

$ today=$(date +%d-%b-%Y)

$ echo $today
12-Mar-2004
</pre>
</p><p>
I often use command substitution to get information about several RPM
packages at once. If I want a listing of all the files from all the RPM
packages that have httpd in the name, I simply execute the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ rpm -ql $(rpm -qa | grep httpd)
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d74580.0x1e6cea0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The inner command, <tt  >rpm -qa | grep httpd</tt>, lists all the packages that
have httpd in the name. The outer command, <tt  >rpm
-ql</tt>, lists all
the files in each package.
</p><p>
Now, those of you who have experience with the Bourne shell might point
out that you could perform command substitution by surrounding a
command with back quotes, also called back-ticks. Using Bourne-style
command substitution, the date assignment from above becomes:

<pre     class="programlisting">
today2=`date +%d-%b-%Y`

$ echo $today2
12-Mar-2004
</pre>
</p><p>
There are two important advantages to using the newer bash-style syntax
for command substitution. First, it can be nested more easily. Because the opening and closing symbols are
different, the inner symbols don't need to be escaped with back slashes.
Second, it is easier to read, especially when nested.
</p><p>
Even on Linux, where bash is standard, you still encounter shell
scripts that use the older, Bourne-style syntax. This is done to provide
portability to various flavors of UNIX that do not always have bash
available but do have the Bourne shell. bash is backward-compatible
with the Bourne shell, so it can understand the older syntax.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d74580.0x1e6d1b8"></a>
Redirecting Standard Error</h2></div></div><p>
Have you ever looked for a file using the <tt  >find</tt> command, only to learn
the file you were looking for is lost in a sea of <tt  >permission
denied</tt>
error messages that quickly fill your terminal window?
</p><p>
If you are the administrator of the system, you can become root and
execute <tt  >find</tt> again as root. Because root can read any file, you don't get
that error anymore. Unfortunately, not everyone has root access on the
system being used. Besides, it's bad practice to be root unless
it's absolutely necessary. So what can you do?
</p><p>
One thing you can do is redirect your output to a file. Basic output
redirection should be nothing new to anyone who has spent a reasonable
amount of time using any UNIX or Linux shell, so I won't go into detail
regarding the basics of output redirection. To save the useful output
from the find command, you can redirect the output to a file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ find /  -name foo &gt; output.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
You still see the error messages on the screen but not the path
of the file you're looking for. Instead, that is placed in the file
output.txt. When the find command completes, you can
<tt  >cat</tt> the file
output.txt to get the location(s) of the file(s) you want.
</p><p>
That's an acceptable solution, but there's a better way. Instead of
redirecting the standard output to a file, you can redirect the error
messages to a file. This can be done by placing a
2 directly in front
of the redirection angle bracket. If you are not interested in the error
messages, you simply can send them to /dev/null:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ find /  -name foo 2&gt; /dev/null
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d74580.0x1e6d630"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This shows you the location of file foo, if it
exists, without those pesky <tt  >permission denied</tt> error
messages. I almost always invoke the find command in
this way.
</p><p>
The number 2 represents the standard error output stream. Standard error
is where most commands send their error messages. Normal (non-error)
output is sent to standard output, which can be represented by the number
1. Because most redirected output is the standard output, output
redirection works only on the standard output stream by default. This
makes the following two commands equivalent:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ find / -name foo &gt; output.txt
$ find / -name foo 1&gt; output.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
Sometimes you might want to save both the error messages and the standard
output to file. This often is done with cron jobs, when you want to save
all the output to a log file. This also can be done by directing both output
streams to the same file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ find / -name foo &gt; output.txt 2&gt; output.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
This works, but again, there's a better way to do it. You can
tie the standard error stream to the standard output stream using an
ampersand. Once you do this, the error messages goes to wherever you
redirect the standard output:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ find / -name foo &gt; output.txt 2&gt;&amp;1

</pre>
</p><p>
One caveat about doing this is that the tying operation goes at the end
of the command generating the output. This is important if piping the
output to another command. This line works as expected:

<pre     class="programlisting">

find -name test.sh 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee /tmp/output2.txt

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d74580.0x1e6da50"></a></h2></div></div><p>
but this line doesn't:

<pre     class="programlisting">

find -name test.sh | tee /tmp/output2.txt 2&gt;&amp;1

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d74580.0x1e6dbb0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and neither does this one:

<pre     class="programlisting">

find -name test.sh 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; /tmp/output.txt

</pre>
</p><p>
I started this discussion on output redirection using the find command as
an example, and all the examples used the find command. This discussion
isn't limited to the output of find, however. Many other commands
can generate enough error messages to obscure the one or two lines of
output you need.
</p><p>
Output redirection isn't limited to bash, either. All UNIX/Linux shells
support output redirection using the same syntax.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d74580.0x2266010"></a>
Searching the Command History</h2></div></div><p>
One of the greatest features of the bash shell is command
history, which makes it easy to navigate through past commands by
navigating up and down through your history with the up and down arrow
keys. This is fine if the command you want to repeat is within the last
10&ndash;20 commands you executed, but it becomes tedious when the command
is 75&ndash;100 commands back in your history.
</p><p>
To speed things up, you can search interactively through your command
history by pressing Ctrl-R. After doing this, your prompt changes to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(reverse-i-search)`':
</pre>
</p><p>
Start typing a few letters of the command you're looking for, and bash
shows you the most recent command that contains the string you've
typed so far. What you type is shown between the ` and ' in the
prompt. In the example below, I typed in <tt  >htt</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(reverse-i-search)`htt': rpm -ql $(rpm -qa | grep httpd)
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d74580.0x22662d0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This shows that the most recent command I typed containing the string
htt is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -ql $(rpm -qa | grep httpd)
</pre>
</p><p>
To execute that command again, I can press Enter. If I want to
edit it, I can press the left or right arrow key. This places the
command on the command line at a normal prompt, and I now can edit it as
if I just typed it in. This can be a real time saver for commands with
a lot of arguments that are far back in the command history.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d74580.0x2266488"></a>
Using for Loops from the Command Line</h2></div></div><p>
One last tip I'd like to offer is using loops from the command line. The
command line is not the place to write complicated scripts that include
multiple loops or branching. For small loops, though, it can be a great
time saver. Unfortunately, I don't see many people taking advantage of
this. Instead, I frequently see people use the up arrow key to go back
in the command history and modify the previous command for each iteration.
</p><p>
If you are not familiar with creating for loops or other types of loops,
many good books on shell scripting discuss this topic. A
discussion on for loops in general is an article in itself.
</p><p>
You can write loops interactively in two ways. The first way,
and the method I prefer, is to separate each line with a semicolon. A
simple loop to make a backup copy of all the files in a directory would
look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ for file in * ; do cp $file $file.bak; done
</pre>
</p><p>
Another way to write loops is to press Enter after each line instead of
inserting a semicolon. bash recognizes that you are creating a loop
from the use of the for keyword, and it prompts you for the next line with
a secondary prompt. It knows you are done when you enter the keyword
done, signifying that your loop is complete:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ for file in *
&gt; do cp $file $file.bak
&gt; done
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d74580.0x2266748"></a>
And Now for Something Completely Different</h2></div></div><p>
When I originally conceived this article, I was going to name it
&ldquo;Stupid
bash Tricks&rdquo;, and show off some unusual, esoteric bash commands I've
learned. The tone of the article has changed since then, but there is
one stupid bash trick I'd like to share.
</p><p>
About five years ago, a Linux system I was responsible for ran out of
memory. Even simple commands, such as ls, failed with an <tt  >insufficient
memory</tt> error. The obvious solution to this problem was simply
to reboot. One of the other system administrators wanted to look at a file
that may have held clues to the problem, but he couldn't remember the exact
name of the file. We could switch to different directories, because the
cd command is part of bash, but we couldn't get a list of the files,
because
even ls would fail.
To get around this problem, the other system administrator created a
simple loop to show us the files in the directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ for file in *; do echo $file; done
</pre>
</p><p>
This worked when ls wouldn't, because echo is a part of the bash shell,
so it already is loaded into memory. It's an interesting solution to an
unusual problem. Now, can anyone suggest a way to display the contents
of a file using only bash built-ins?

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The bash shell has many great features to make life easier for its
users. I hope this summary of bash tricks I like to use has shown you
some new ways to take advantage of the power bash has to offer.
