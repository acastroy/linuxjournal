A hardware design from an unmanned aircraft project,
along with Linux and other free software, got this
project done quickly at a bargain price.

By the time you read this, TacSat-1 might already be
in orbit. We're all in suspense as our cover project
prepares to ride the first launch of the new SpaceX
Falcon-1 launch vehicle from Vandenberg Air Force
Base in California.
</p><p>
TacSat-1 aims to do for task force commanders what
commodity hardware and open-source software can
do for business managers. With the new satellite
capability, commanders in the field will be able
to track individual enemy radars and transmitters,
and get visual and infrared imagery, with minimal
bureaucracy.
</p><p>
It's a high-profile space version of what's been
happening on Earth for a long time. Information
technology is becoming faster and more responsive
to real business needs. Road maps, customer-hostile
business models, and anything else that gets in the
way are obsolete. In this issue, we're celebrating
the projects that don't merely get the job done
and more cheaply and reliably, but those that open up new information
technology avenues for people who otherwise would be
locked out by pointless restrictions.
</p><p>
Have a look at Charles Curley's &ldquo;Finding Your Way
with GpsDrive&rdquo; on page 50. Unlike a monolithic GPS
mapping product, you can combine your choice of maps
with public GPS data to get the navigation you need.
Yes, you can cruise for wireless Net access and plot
it. Please be nice. Meanwhile, if you're worried
about other people getting on your wireless network,
Mick Bauer has some good news for you in the form
of a new security standard and a way to integrate
Wi-Fi security with your existing infrastructure.
Get started with WPA on page 36.
</p><p>
Paul Barry had a problem converting his data into
the promised Microsoft PowerPoint slides. Fire up
the &ldquo;productivity&rdquo; application? No thanks&mdash;not
enough time. Run everything through a script and
OpenOffice.org, and the job's done and the carpal
tunnels in Paul's mouse hand are safe, see page 58. Keeping
up with vendors who try to lock in customers
with undocumented formats is tough. Thanks,
OpenOffice.org.
</p><p>
Sometimes you need to convert a system to Linux, or to
a special-purpose Linux distribution, temporarily.
On page 54, Daniel Barlow gets you started with
modifying Knoppix to create your own personal live CD.
Render Farm? BZFlag Zone? The choice is up to you.
</p><p>
Our Web columnist, Reuven Lerner, is celebrating his
100th column (page 22). Thanks, Reuven, for breaking through
the wild and woolly mess of the Web to bring us ideas
and technology that really work, for Linux users
and everyone else. There's plenty of other great
technical stuff in this issue, too. But even if you
don't use any of the specific advice&mdash;which I doubt,
considering we could all use a couple more shell
tricks, as Prentice Bisbal brings us on page 76&mdash;remember the reason why all this stuff is so great.
With Linux and the other software we cover, you
have the freedom to make your project happen the way
you want. See you at the launchpad.
