Keeping directories in sync on multiple machines can be difficult.
Running
Unison is one way to make the task easier.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130f580.0x1407348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Unison is a file-synchronization tool that runs on
Linux, UNIX and Microsoft Windows.
Those of you who've
used IBM Lotus Notes or Intellisync Mobile Suite probably
have an idea of what synchronization is good
for, as compared to one-way mirroring options such as rsync. You
might have mirrored a company document directory
to your laptop, for example, and then modified a
document or two. Other people might have modified
other documents in the same directory by the time you
get back. With rsync, you'd need to reconcile
the differences between the two directories manually or risk
overwriting someone's changes. Unison can sort out
what has changed where, propagate the changed files
and even merge different changes to the same file if
you tell it how.
</p><p>
Think of Unison as two-way rsync with a bit of revision control mixed
in. The most common use is keeping your local and remote home
directory, or some data directory you often use in different contexts, in
sync. It
uses the rsync algorithm to keep network traffic down and should be
tunneled through SSH over untrusted networks. No extra work is
needed&mdash;simply specify
ssh:// when adding a directory location. Quite a bit of
extra disk space often is needed for Unison, though, because the synchronizer needs to keep
track of what the files looked like on the last run.

Getting, Compiling and Installing Unison</h2></div></div><p>
Unison's home page is maintained at the University of Pennsylvania; the project
leader, Benjamin C. Pierce, is a professor in the Department of Computer
and Information Science. See the on-line Resources for the URL.
</p><p>
Unison isn't as widely deployed as rsync, so you might not be able
to find a precompiled package for your distribution. But the binaries
downloadable from the Unison home page should work for most people.
</p><p>
If you'd like to compile from source, you can. A few extra hoops must
be jumped through, however, because Unison is programmed in OCaml, not
the most common language. See Resources if there is no handy package
for your distribution.
</p><p>
Compiling and installing Unison is simple; type <tt  >make
UISTYLE=xxx</tt>. The GTK user
interface needs additional OCaml bindings for GTK, so I use the text
interface in this article. Typing <tt  >make UISTYLE=text</tt> or
<tt  >make UISTYLE=gtk</tt>
should give you a Unison executable. Simply copy the executable to
somewhere in the path on both machines you want to synchronize.
</p><p>
In this article, I'm using the current stable version of Unison, 2.9.1, unless
otherwise noted. You need to use the latest betas if you're going
to synchronize files larger than 2GB.
</p><p>
The developer versions tend to work well. They are what the developers run
themselves on their own precious data. Sign up for the unison-hackers
mailing list if you feel a bit adventurous. Jerome Vouillon,
Benjamin C. Pierce and Trevor Jim tend to hang out there discussing
improvements. Commit logs also float by, so you can track what is
going on.

Configuring and Using Unison</h2></div></div><p>
Unison keeps its config and working files in a .unison directory in your
home directory or wherever you want to put it. Set the UNISON environment
variable to specify an alternate location.
</p><p>
The default configuration is stored in .unison/default.prf. Listing
1 shows a plain config file suitable for testing. Synchronizing two
directories is now as simple as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ unison /nfsmount/dir1 /home/me/dir1
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130f580.0x1407a28"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. .unison/default.prf
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Unison preferences file
merge = diff3 -m CURRENT1 OLD CURRENT2 &gt; NEW
backup = Name *
maxbackups = 10
log = true
logfile = /home/knan/.unison/unison.log
rshargs = -C
</pre></div><p>
Unison then asks the user about any differences between the
directories and offers reasonable defaults. It does take a bit of time to
get used to Unison's way of thinking, however. And, Unison is no substitute for
backups. Unison happily propagates back the deletion of all the files
in one replica, for example, which can be a rude awakening for programmers
used to CVS. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rm dir1/* ; unison ssh://server/dir1 dir1
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130f580.0x1407c90"></a></h2></div></div><p>
doesn't do what
you expect from a:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rm dir1/*; cvs update dir1
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130f580.0x1407df0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Deleting a file is
an action that is replicated on the other side upon synchronization. So,
this example command removes all files in dir1 on both sides.
</p><p>
Once you feel comfortable, consider adding <tt  >auto =
true</tt> to the
Unison profile. This skips questions about any non-conflicting changes
but
gives you a chance to back out at the end.
</p><p>
The Unison manual is recommended reading. It is clear and well written and explains
what happens at most corner cases.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130f580.0x1408000"></a>
Keeping Home Directories in Sync</h2></div></div><p>
Once users become familiar with Unison, a common thought is to use it for keeping
one's home directory in sync between machines, say, your laptop and
desktop. This can be realized pretty easily. Listing 2 has a simple
profile that does the job, but you probably want to extend it. Listing 2,
for example,
ignores MP3 files and Unison's own files and demonstrates the use of
<tt  >include</tt> for having common settings applied to all profiles.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130f580.0x1408160"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. .unison/home.prf
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Unison preferences file
root = /home/erik
root = ssh://remotehost/home/erik
# exactly two or none "root" lines
ignore = Name *.mp3
# ignore all .mp3 files anywhere
ignore = Path .unison
# ignore all files with .unison somewhere in their full path
include default
# imports settings from default.prf
</pre></div><p>
Test our new profile like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ unison home -testserver
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130f580.0x14083c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And invoke it like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ unison home -batch
$ unison home
</pre>
</p><p>
The -batch run takes care of the easy cases without asking, backing
up and logging as needed, and the second run asks you about any tricky
business&mdash;like merging.
</p><p>
The <tt  >root =</tt> lines can be omitted if you want to specify the files to
be synchronized on the command line instead. The lines are equivalent
to this invocation:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ unison home /home/erik ssh://remotehost/home/erik
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130f580.0x1408688"></a>
Merging Conflicting Changes</h2></div></div><p>
In order to do a three-way merge, backups must be enabled. By default,
with backups disabled, Unison keeps only a checksum and metadata, such as
permissions, so it has no unmodified file to reference.
</p><p>
In version 2.9.1 of Unison, if you choose merge for a conflict and the merge
is successful without manual intervention, the changes are propagated
immediately, which doesn't give you a chance to back out. So, if you
have the space, I suggest leaving maxbackups at 5 or so, instead of
the default 2, to leave yourself the chance of recovering from automatic
mismerges. Contents of the backup directory after a merge look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls -1 .unison/backup/
shared.txt		merged version ("NEW")
shared.txt.1.unibck	changed remotely ("CURRENT2")
shared.txt.2.unibck	changed locally ("CURRENT1")
shared.txt.3.unibck	old version ("OLD")
</pre>
</p><p>
As of the newest beta, 2.10.3 at the time of this writing, Unison can invoke
different merge programs for different files. You might want to use 3DM to
merge XML files, for example, or a database merge tool for your Berkeley
databases. This functionality still is new and subject to change. It
has been noted by the project leader that the merge functionality was in
need of a rewrite and didn't really work too well in 2.9.1 and 2.9.20.
Thus, if you intend to do much merging, you will be better off tracking
the bleeding edge.
