Create your own special-purpose live CD distribution with
these little-known secrets of bootable CDs.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fb580.0x29f32f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
You've probably heard of Knoppix, the Debian-based
distribution that squeezes 2GB of applications on a single standalone
CD. It's been used as a Linux demonstration tool, a rescue disk and even
as a Debian installer. It's inspired a small raft of related
projects, ranging from CDs containing Knoppix, plus or minus a few
extra packages, to complete re-architectures of the system.
</p><p>
I recently set out to produce a live CD for a product demonstration.
I started by taking the Knoppix CD apart to see how it ticked, and
I ended up with a Makefile and a few ancillary files that are clearly
Knoppix-inspired but have little derived code. This is what I
learned.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fb580.0x29f3450"></a>
A Brief Tour</h2></div></div><p>
If you put the Knoppix CD in a CD-ROM drive and mount it, you soon notice
that it doesn't look much like an ordinary Linux installation. There
are a few graphic files and a free music track, but no init, no /dev and no
/bin. The magic is in the big file called /KNOPPIX/KNOPPIX, an
ISO9660 filesystem image compressed for the cloop device.
</p><p>
The standard loop device in the kernel allows you to access a file in
some filesystem as if it were a device; requests for blocks of the
device are mapped to requests for blocks in the underlying file.
Because you can mount the device, this effectively means you can
create images of filesystems and access them as if they were real
hardware disks. If you downloaded Knoppix from the Net, you have an
ISO9660 image that can be loop mounted to look at its contents:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# mkdir /tmp/knoppix-cd
# mount -o loop -r \
$HOME/KNOPPIX_V3.3-2003-09-24-EN.iso /tmp/knoppix-cd
</pre>
</p><p>
The cloop compressed loop device takes this a step further. In this
adaptation of the loop device, each block is compressed with gzip and
transparently decompressed when it's accessed. /KNOPPIX/KNOPPIX is an
image for this device that is mounted during startup&mdash;this is how
Knoppix gets 2GB onto a 650MB CD.
</p><p>
You don't need to install cloop in your usual kernel if you simply want
to look around the inner filesystem. Install the cloop-utils package
and use extract_compressed_fs, as shown below. You need about 2GB of free
space in
/var/tmp or wherever you decide to put the image:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# mkdir /tmp/knoppix-cloop
# extract_compressed_fs \
   /tmp/knoppix-cd/KNOPPIX/KNOPPIX \
    &gt;/var/tmp/KNOPPIX-cloop
# mount -o loop /var/tmp/KNOPPIX-cloop \
   /tmp/knoppix-cloop
# find /tmp/knoppix-cloop -print

</pre>
</p><p>
You can look, but you can't touch&mdash;the ISO9660 filesystem is
read-only. To modify the distribution, you first need to copy both
filesystem images to ordinary directories:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# mkdir $HOME/my-knoppix-tree  \
    $HOME/my-knoppix-cd-tree
# tar -C /tmp/knoppix-cloop -cf - . | \
    tar -C $HOME/my-knoppix-tree -xvpf -
# tar -C /tmp/knoppix-cd -cf - . | \
    tar -C $HOME/my-knoppix-cd-tree -xvpf -
# umount /tmp/knoppix-cd /tmp/knoppix-cloop

</pre>
</p><p>
Now, you can hack away to your heart's content. The most convenient way to do
this is to change root into the Knoppix inner tree using the chroot
command:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# mount -t proc none $HOME/my-knoppix-tree/proc
# cp /etc/resolv.conf \
$HOME/my-knoppix-tree/etc/resolv.conf
# chroot $HOME/my-knoppix-tree /bin/sh

</pre>
</p><p>
From here, you can use all the usual Debian package management commands
(dpkg, apt-get and so on) to install or delete whatever you like. When you're
done, exit the chroot and unmount proc, unless you want your development
system's process list immortalised on CD. Then, use
<tt  >create_compressed_tree</tt> and
<tt  >mkisofs</tt> to create the inner and outer
images:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# mkisofs -L -R -l -V "KNOPPIX ISO9660" -v \
-allow-multidot $HOME/my-knoppix-tree | \
create_compressed_fs - 65536 &gt; \
$HOME/my-knoppix-cd/KNOPPIX/KNOPPIX

# mkisofs -l -r -J -V "KNOPPIX with local stuff" \
-hide-rr-moved -v -b KNOPPIX/boot-en.img \
-c KNOPPIX/boot.cat -o knoppix.iso \
$HOME/my-knoppix-cd

</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, burn knoppix.iso to a CD-ROM and boot it. If you prefer, you can test without
burning by using Bochs or VMware.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fb580.0x29f3a28"></a>
Further In</h2></div></div><p>
This simple approach starts to break down, however, when you want more extensive
customizations. For example, if you want X to start a particular window
manager but don't want to use all of GNOME or KDE, you have to edit the
script yourself. This isn't hard to do, but it means that you've essentially
forked Knoppix. When a new Knoppix version comes out, you'll have to
do it again. In addition, if you intend to sell your
Knoppix-based CD commercially, you need to remain compliant with the
licenses of all the software you distribute, which means knowing
exactly what's on it. The Knoppix version I looked at contained some files
that weren't from Debian packages, and sometimes they weren't even
free software.
</p><p>
So, is there some other place we could start? Happily, yes. Between
the efforts of Progeny, which donated its installer to the Debian
Project; Klaus Knopper, the author of Knoppix and the creator of the cloop
device; and other Debian developers who are working on adding his
custom code into the main Debian repository&mdash;today we can put together
a passable live CD system from scratch using only Debian packages.
The rest of this article describes how.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fb580.0x29f3b88"></a>
Downloads</h2></div></div><p>
A tarball containing all
the scripts and files referred to here can be found at <a href="http://ftp.linux.org.uk/~dan/livecd" target="_self">ftp.linux.org.uk/~dan/livecd</a>. Due to space limits, here, most of
the code is not reproduced in the article itself. It's mostly
Makefile-driven, with some shell scripts and some simple Perl, and
it should be pretty easy to follow. You may hit a few snags if you're
not using Debian. If you make it work with some other host
distribution, be sure to send patches.
</p><p>
The debootstrap program provides the Debian base system from which you start. Given a
Debian release name and a package mirror URL, debootstrap downloads
and installs the base system into a subdirectory of your choice. This
is pretty flexible; you can chroot into it, use it as a UML root
or, if the subdirectory you chose was on its own filesystem, reboot
your computer and use it directly. You even can burn it onto a CD,
which is what we are going to do. We have some work to do first,
though.
</p><p>
Expect to do quite a lot of debootstrap and package installation as
you test your scripts. Before going much further, save yourself some
time and bandwidth by installing a proxy package archive (such as
apt-proxy) on a convenient machine.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fb580.0x29f3d98"></a>
Adding Packages</h2></div></div><p>
The fix_inner target in the Makefile adds packages to the base system.
The first thing we do is replace start-stop-daemon with /bin/true to
prevent post-installation scripts from running services in our chroot.
With that done, we chroot into the system repeatedly and run such commands
as apt-get and dpkg.
</p><p>
For testing and experimentation, we also have a Perl script,
run-chroot.pl, that simulates a system boot in the chroot area. It
doesn't start most of the services, because they're already running on
the host and would conflict, but it does run an SSH server and the X
startup script. This is a lot more convenient than writing a CD and
rebooting whenever we want to test something.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fb580.0x29f3ef8"></a>
autologin</h2></div></div><p>
There's no point in making people log in on a single-user demonstration
system. You have to tell them the password anyway, and the CD
is read-only so they can't change it beyond the current session. GDM
has an autologin feature, but to keep the image size down we want to
avoid dragging in all the GNOME dependencies. Instead, we simply use
<tt  >su</tt> to
start X as a non-root user and run the .xsession script, which opens
an xterm and Emacs and starts our application. The autologin-x script
is installed as /etc/init.d.autologin-x, with appropriate symlinks to
make it run at boot.
</p><p>
The script chooses which X server to run based on whether DISPLAY is
set already; if so, it starts up Xvnc instead of XFree86. This is done to
help with testing: when autologin-x is run by run-chroot.pl inside an
xterm, we can connect to it with a VNC client to make sure all the
usual X applications come up correctly.
Of course, for X to work on the real CD-ROM, we need to know what video
hardware the user has.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fb580.0x29f40b0"></a>
Hardware Detection</h2></div></div><p>
Hardware detection in Linux has improved a lot in the last ten years,
helped by the improvements in hardware technologies. It's a lot
easier to detect today's PCI and USB hardware reliably and safely than it
was with
the ISA devices we used to have.
</p><p>
Most Linux distributors have something that grovels through the PCI
and USB devices in the system and loads appropriate modules. Knoppix
uses Kudzu, originally written for Red Hat, but vanilla Debian uses
the discover command. The two are pretty similar in coverage; as it's all
open source, they can copy from each other's hardware
databases. The Debian X server packages already use discover to
provide defaults for X configuration questions, so we'll stick with it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fb580.0x29f4210"></a>
debconf</h2></div></div><p>
What do we do with the hardware we detect? Debian packages have
human-editable configuration files, but they typically also come with
post-installation scripts that create the initial versions of said
files interactively. Where applicable, such as for X and network
configuration, these scripts run the hardware detection tools.
</p><p>
The problem is we're installing the packages in a chroot on the host
system, and detecting the host system's hardware is not going to help
on the target. What we need to do is put the debconf database
somewhere writable, so at boot time we can use debconf-communicate
to unconfigure the package and run its .config script to make it
think it's being configured for the first time. This is a more thorough
approach
than using dpkg-reconfigure, which sometimes asks questions such as, &ldquo;Are you
sure you want to reconfigure this package?&rdquo; This can be confusing to the end user
who hasn't even configured it once yet. See the debconf-communicate
manual page and target/etc/init.d/configure-xserver in the tarball for
details.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fb580.0x29f43c8"></a>
Persistent Storage: Hotplug</h2></div></div><p>
The CD-ROM is read-only, and a ramdisk goes away when the power is
turned off. People want to save their files, though, or even have
access to the files they've created already on existing hard disks or on
removable devices, including USB keychains and Zip drives. Again, most of
the hard work has been done for us; this time hotplug and autofs are
our saviours.
</p><p>
Hotplug listens for new devices being added or removed. When it sees
a new USB storage device, it loads any necessary modules and creates
an emulated SCSI host. We still need to know what devices are
available and mount them, and that's where autofs comes in.
</p><p>
autofs mounts and unmounts filesystems on demand. Using a program
map, we can have a Perl script run whenever the user asks for
/media/list; it creates a directory with links named after the
attached devices. These links point to more autofs mount points to access
the filesystems. In the tarball, look at target/etc/auto.master and
target/usr/local/sbin/autofs-device-list.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fb580.0x29f4580"></a>
The Kernel</h2></div></div><p>
We use basically the same kernel configuration as Knoppix (look at
/usr/src/linux/.config in a running Knoppix system, or kernel-config
in our tarball), but we remove support for a few obviously unused things,
such as ZISOFS. The standard Debian make-kpkg tool patches, builds and
installs the kernel. This is a Debian dependency on the host system
(you need the cloop-src package), and as it's probably the only
nontrivial such dependency, it might be worth moving into the
chroot in a later version.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fb580.0x29f4688"></a>
The Filesystem</h2></div></div><p>
Most of a UNIX filesystem is happy mounted read-only, but we do need
to write files in some places. For example, the X server configuration
file needs to be written at boot time according to the hardware in
use, the debconf database must be updated and there are various log
and lock files too.
</p><p>
We use the tmpfs filesystem to create a RAM-based filesystem. The
system is arranged to use this ramdisk for root and expect the cloop
image on /ro. Then for read-only directories, we create symlinks, for
example, from /usr to /ro/usr.
</p><p>
We keep a list of read-only directories, and we check it twice. First, we
create a tarball of the system that excludes all these directories,
replacing them with appropriate symlinks. This tarball then is copied into the
root filesystem of the running system. Second, when we're writing out
the ISO9660 image to be cloop-compressed, this is the list of
directories to include.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fb580.0x29f4840"></a>
initrd</h2></div></div><p>
Before the system proper starts up, there are two important things
we must do. First, we need to
mount the cloop image, load whatever modules the CD-ROM needs, then
find and mount the CD. Next, we install the cloop device and mount
the inner filesystem on it.
Second, we create a ramdisk for the root filesystem and copy the root_fs.tgz
image from the CD into it.
</p><p>
We use the initrd (initial ramdisk) support to create a mini root
filesystem that the kernel mounts and runs before the real init
starts. This is a gzipped filesystem. When a kernel with initrd
support is booted with the command line
<tt  >initrd=filename</tt>, it loads
the contents of that filename and creates a ramdisk out of it. It then
starts running the /linuxrc file in that ramdisk.
</p><p>
When linuxrc has finished, it uses the pivot_root call to change onto
the real root directory, which was /ramdisk, and executes the real init.
</p><p>
The initrd and the kernel together need to be small enough to fit in
1.44MB of RAM with all the other files on the boot image. This is not a lot
of space, as GNU libc alone is about 1,200K, we're going to have to be
pretty creative.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fb580.0x29f4aa8"></a>
dietlibc, Busybox</h2></div></div><p>
Even if you've never wanted a Linux PDA or an in-car MP3 jukebox, you now
have a reason to be grateful to embedded Linux hackers. We're going to
use Busybox and dietlibc to get our quart into the proverbial pint
pot. Busybox is a small shell that can be configured at build time
to include many common utilities as built-ins, and dietlibc is an
alternative C library optimized for small size. By happy coincidence
there turns out to be a Busybox applet for everything we need on the
initrd, and by statically linking with dietlibc we can get all this
into about 100K. For comparison, the same Busybox options statically
linked against glibc get a 500K executable.
</p><p>
Applets for Busybox are enabled using #defines in its Config.h file
(in the tarball). Some of the disabled options may seem rather
arbitrary, but when you already have a choice of <tt  >echo
*</tt> and <tt  >tar cvf
/dev/null</tt> to list the current directory,
<tt  >ls</tt> really is a
luxury.
</p><p>
We create the initrd using <tt  >genext2fs</tt>, avoiding the need for a
loopback mount. This generates an ext2 filesystem from a directory
tree, which we gzip and copy into the boot floppy image (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7246f1.large.jpg"><img src="7246f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Wheels within wheels: the finished CD nests
filesystem images inside filesystem images inside filesystem images.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fb580.0x29eb808"></a>
Booting</h2></div></div><p>
The standard for booting from CD-ROM is known as El Torito and was
originally produced by the Phoenix BIOS writers. El Torito allows the
creation of one or more disk images on the CD-ROM. At boot time, the
BIOS locates these and creates an emulated disk from which it then boots.
Images may be of floppies (1.44MB or 2.88MB) or of hard disks.
There's also a no-emulation mode, in which the BIOS loads sectors
from the specified file and executes them without setting up an
emulated disk.
</p><p>
There's a catch, of course: El Torito is implemented by BIOS writers. Linux
users with laptops or other interesting hardware already know
that BIOSes are not always the least-buggy code on the planet. It's
been suggested that some manufacturers happily ignore the actual
specification as long as whatever they concoct manages to load the
current version of Windows. So, painful though the space restriction
is, to ensure maximum portability, we follow Knoppix's lead and stick
to a single 1.44MB floppy image.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fb580.0x29eb968"></a>
boot.img</h2></div></div><p>
What do we put in this 1.44MB? We could boot a raw Linux kernel, or
we could use a normal Linux bootloader such as LILO or Grub. H Peter
Anvin's SYSLINUX tool beats both of these options for ease of use,
though. SYSLINUX creates boot disks that use an MS-DOS filesystem, so
we can create the floppy disk image using the userland mtools. The
disk needs the kernel vmlinuz file, syslinux.cfg, any ancillary help
files and the initrd image. When done, we run SYSLINUX on it.
</p><p>
All that remains now is to create our filesystems and burn them, much
as we did earlier. The inner filesystem is in $(SCRATCH)/CLOOP. We
create an outer filesystem containing this, boot.img and root_fs.tgz.
We then write that to CD (a CD-RW or two would be useful) and reboot with
it. And, with any luck, it works.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fb580.0x29ebac8"></a>
Finishing Up</h2></div></div><p>
As a longtime Linux user who hasn't done a normal install in years,
it's impressive to see how much work has been done recently
on hardware detection and autoconfiguration. As time goes by, I'm sure
it'll get even better.
</p><p>
Where does this project go next? The automount support needs work;
we might try something like Volumatic instead. Other than that, it
depends on the product based on it. But all the scripts are free
software, and I'm looking forward to feedback.
