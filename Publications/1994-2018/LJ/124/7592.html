It isn't that strange, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>. Every year at this time, we talk
about the ultimate Linux box, Fran&ccedil;ois. We try to outdo one another in
terms of graphics, speed, memory, disk space and so on. The ultimate,
invariably, is also a question of the latest and greatest. The trouble
I have, Fran&ccedil;ois, is that as new as all this hardware extravaganza is,
it is all the same thing. Then it occurred to me that if my Linux box
could help out in the kitchen, that truly would be something new.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Non, Fran&ccedil;ois</em></span>, you do not have to worry, your job is safe. Besides,
this is exactly the sort of thing that might help make your job easier.
In fact, I would not be surprised if many of our
guests find that using Linux to help when it comes to cooking is
simply natural. Speaking of guests, I see they have arrived. Welcome,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois! Go to the cellar and bring back the 1997
Brunello di Montalcino, <span   class="emphasis"><em>imm&eacute;diatement</em></span>!
</p><p>
While my faithful waiter fetches the wine, I should tell you about
today's menu. In honor of this issue's theme of the ultimate Linux box,
I've located a few programs to make your Linux box cook. I don't mean
screaming performance, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, but cooking with food and wine.
</p><p>
Looking for a way to get my Linux box to help out in the kitchen led
me to <span   class="bold"><b>Krecipes</b></span> (see the on-line
Resources section). Unai Garro,
Jason Kivlighn and Bosselut Cyril have been putting together a nice
open-source package that makes creating and maintaining your own list of
favorite recipes a breeze. Krecipes lets you create and edit your own
recipes as well as import them from popular exchange formats, including RecipeML,
MasterCook, Meal-Master and others. It saves its own recipes in KreML
(Krecipes XML format). You also can maintain categories, track calories
(fiber, fat and so on), create shopping lists based on selected meals
and more.
</p><p>
Ah, Fran&ccedil;ois, you have returned. Please, pour for our guests.
</p><p>
Krecipes stores its recipes in a database, so you need to have either
MySQL or SQLite (see Resources) installed before compiling and using the
software. SQLite is a small program-embeddable database that requires
somewhat less overhead and administration than MySQL, but it's not as
full-featured or powerful. For an application such as this, users may find it
to be an attractive option. The beauty of SQLite is no database process
needs to be running on the system in order to take advantage of SQL
database capabilities, storage and access.
</p><p>
If you have both MySQL and SQLite on your system, support is compiled
for both at build time. Speaking of building, this is a classic case
of the extract and build five-step:


<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf krecipes_alpha_0.4.1.tar.gz
cd krecipes
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
su -c "make install"
</pre>
</p><p>
During your first time with Krecipes (the program name is krecipes), a wizard
guides you through some basic setup processes, including a choice of database in
which to store the information. If you have compiled the program with
both MySQL and SQLite, you can choose either. Because we've already
covered many programs that use a MySQL back end in this restaurant,
I thought it might be nice to go with SQLite. I made that my choice
and clicked Next.
</p><p>
Once you have made your selection, Krecipes offers to populate the program
with some sample recipes. Make sure you click on this check box before
continuing with the setup so you wind up with a few examples to help
familiarize yourself with the software.

details of his famous Spanish Omelette using Krecipes.
</p></div></div><p>
To create a new recipe, click File on the menubar and select New or
simply click the new recipe button in the top left-hand side of the icon
bar. The recipe dialog has three tabs. One is for the recipe
basics&mdash;the name, the author, which category it should be filed under (you can
create new categories) and how many people the dish serves. See Figure
1 for an example. The other two tabs are for the ingredients list and
the description. In all cases, you can save your work at any time or
return to it later for updates.
</p><p>
If you would rather take advantage of the many thousands of recipes
available on the Internet in Meal-Master and RecipeML format, it's
easy to import them. All this talk of food, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>,
just reinforces the importance of a well-stocked wine cellar.
</p><p>
Another great recipe manager you may want to investigate is Douglas
Squirrel's <span   class="bold"><b>LargoRecipes</b></span>. LargoRecipes (named after the author's dog)
lets you manage recipes, share them with friends (through Web pages), create
shopping lists, build meal plans and more. You also can import Meal-Master
and RecipeML format recipes. Have a look at Figure 2 for a sample of
LargoRecipes in action.

</p></div></div><p>
To install LargoRecipes, you need at least Java 1.4,
which should tell you that no compiling
is involved in the installation. Download and save two files from the
LargoRecipes Web site (see Resources). The first is the largorecipes distribution; I'll get to
the second file shortly. At the time of this writing, version 0.9.2.1
was available. To install the package, save the bundle to a directory
of your choice&mdash;I created a Largo directory in my home
directory&mdash;and
execute the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd ~/Largo
java -jar largorecipes-0.9.2.1.jar
</pre>
</p><p>
That also is the command you use to run it on subsequent uses. On
your first run, an installation dialog appears. All of the supporting
data files and directories are created from where you run the
installation. One of those directories is called demo. This
is where you save the second file you download, the LargoRecipes demo
file. It also is available from the LargoRecipes Web site's download page.
</p><p>
To activate the sample recipes, for this session only, click LargoRecipes
on the menubar and select Demonstration. If you would rather skip this
and start importing recipes, consider checking out the LargoRecipes
RecipeML archive. There are 10,000 recipes in zipped bundles available
on the site; look for the link on the main page.
</p><p>
To share your recipes with others, LargoRecipes provides a Web page
export function. Click Internet on the menubar and select Web Page, and a
list of available recipes appears in the right-hand window. Select
the ones you want, and then press Add to add them to the export list. When you
have made all your choices, choose a title for the page but don't click
Go yet. You should see a check box labeled Include XML Download. Make
sure that is checked to provide a link on each recipe's page
so that visitors to your site can download RecipeML format
copies of the recipes. They then can import those into their favorite
recipe system.
</p><p>
For those of you who are curious, check out the Resources section for a
link to the RecipeML format specification. It's always good to know how
these things work, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non?</em></span> I've also provided a link to the Meal-Master
Web site. There are plenty of links there from which you can find a huge
number of recipes ready for import into your favorite package.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon Dieu, mes amis</em></span>, closing time has arrived and all I have done
is make you more hungry. Perhaps Fran&ccedil;ois will be kind enough to refill
our glasses a final time. In the meantime, I shall bring out
my famous baked double-butter brie with spicy mixed-berry coulis. With
all these tempting tastes loaded on our Linux systems, appetizers
certainly are in order. Until next time, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, let us all drink
to one another's health. <span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute; Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
