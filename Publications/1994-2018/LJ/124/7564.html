  <div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h1 class="title"><a name="N0x10a9580.0x11a0ab0"></a>2004 Editors' Choice Awards</h1></div><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Linux Journal Staff</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #124, August 2004</div></div><div><p>
We're excited about some great new Linux hardware and software,
but we're still depending on some old favorites too.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a9580.0x11a10e0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
It's getting harder and harder to keep up with all
the great Linux-related products, services and
projects out there. Fortunately, we've expanded our
list of contributing editors over the past year,
and the panel for Editors' Choice is looking
pretty distinguished. So, without further ado,
here's Editors' Choice Awards 2004.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a9580.0x11a11e8"></a>
Server Hardware: HP ProLiant BL20p G2</h2></div></div><p>
The HP ProLiant BL20p G2, which Ibrahim Haddad
recommends, features two Intel Xeon processors,
onboard RAID, two hot-swap SCSI drives, three
Gigabit Ethernet interfaces, plus one more Ethernet
connection for management, and optional Fibre Channel.
That would be nice in a 1U rackmount server, but
this box is a blade, and you can pack eight of them,
plus up to six redundant power supplies and your
choice of two switches or other interconnect options,
in a 6U chassis.
</p><p>
If dinky laptop drives have been your reason not to
drink the blade-ade, look again at the new generation
of heavyweight blade servers. Maybe it's time to
save the pizza boxes for pizza.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a9580.0x11a1348"></a>
Personal Computer or Workstation: IBM ThinkPad T41</h2></div></div><p>
Because each editor has different, strongly held opinions
about his or her personal work environment, we
all were surprised when Doc Searls, Ibrahim Haddad and
Robert Love agreed on this: the IBM ThinkPad T41
is the Linux laptop to have. They didn't simply agree
on ThinkPad or ThinkPad T series&mdash;they all use
and like one particular model.
</p><p>
Doc praised the T41's &ldquo;Industrial-strength looks and
race-car feel&rdquo;, and he loves the high performance.
&ldquo;Everything works in Linux&rdquo;, Robert commented.
What happened to the good old days, when we waited
for kernel hackers to buy the unsupported laptops
first and get them going for the rest of us?
The T41 has a 1400&times;1050 screen and IBM's famous
three-year warranty and fast, competent repair service.
</p><p>
Any hardware whose speed gets compared to greased
rodents is at least worthy of an honorable mention,
and Greg Kroah-Hartman made that comparison in his vote for the
dual-processor version of the Apple Power Mac G5,
which is one Linux install away from being a great
system. &ldquo;It's fast, quiet and pretty to look at.
With full 64-bit goodness for a very cheap price,
what's not to like?&rdquo; he wrote.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a9580.0x11a1608"></a>
Security Tool: Clam AntiVirus (AV)</h2></div></div><p>
Reuven Lerner writes, &ldquo;ClamAV is giving the commercial
virus-checking programs a real run for their money.
The combination of ClamAV and SpamAssassin has
reduced dramatically the amount of annoying (and
potentially dangerous) mail sent through my server.&rdquo;
</p><p>
With this year's outbreak of e-mail worms for
non-Linux platforms, ClamAV has been getting quite
a workout, and Linux admins on mailing lists report
that database update times are keeping up with or
beating the proprietary alternatives.
And, yes, commercial support now is available.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a9580.0x11a17c0"></a>
Web Browser or Client: Mozilla Firefox</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;I am beginning to think that Mozilla is the new
Emacs&mdash;a cross-platform program that is solid and
extensible&rdquo;, Reuven writes. See the July 2004 issue
for a tutorial and sample code to get you started on
developing Mozilla-based apps, and see your nearest
Linux desktop for a pop-up-free, standards-compliant
browsing experience.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a9580.0x11a1920"></a>
Graphics Software: The GIMP</h2></div></div><p>
The GIMP Project has released its eagerly anticipated
version 2.0 and regained its top spot as our editors'
favorite graphics tool. Marcel Gagn&eacute; writes,
&ldquo;With the addition of EXIF handling, CMYK support
and a cleaner, better interface, The GIMP remains
unchallenged on my Linux desktop.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a9580.0x11a1a80"></a>
Communication Tool: mutt</h2></div></div><p>
Although instant messaging apps and GUI mailers get all
the demo time at Linux events, the text-based mailer
mutt, which lets you configure practically anything,
remains a cult classic. Greg writes, &ldquo;without it
there is no way I could get through an e-mail feed of
over 500 messages a day.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Don Marti uses Ximian Evolution for its calendar and
contact list but sticks with mutt for mail. Use mutt
together with Mozilla for convenient attachment
viewing, or for a healthy dose of mind-blowing
tweaked-out config files, try a Web search for
&ldquo;my .muttrc&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a9580.0x11a1c90"></a>
Desktop Software: GnuCash</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;I began to use GnuCash several months ago and was
very impressed by its features&rdquo;, Reuven writes.
&ldquo;It has an impressive array of features and can be
programmed using Guile. If you've never managed
your finances before or are shaky on the idea of
double-entry bookkeeping, the built-in tutorial will
help you get started.&rdquo; A financial tool without
double entry is like a paint program without layers.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a9580.0x11a1ea0"></a>
Software Library or Module: Pango</h2></div></div><p>
This is a new category, but it's about time we
recognized library maintainers. Library code saves
time and prevents errors by letting people
&ldquo;outsource&rdquo; parts of apps. We're always happy
to see developers use a good library instead of
reimplementing something from scratch. Reuven
writes, &ldquo;I want to thank all of the hardworking
people who have worked on Pango and the other
internationalization libraries and software that make
non-Western scripts usable with Linux. Thanks to
you, billions of people who don't speak, read or
write English still can use open-source software.
The fact that I can read and write Hebrew e-mail with
the standard version of Mozilla or documents with
the standard version of OpenOffice.org continues to
impress me.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a9580.0x11a2058"></a>
Development Tool: BitKeeper</h2></div></div><p>
Greg writes, &ldquo;It makes my life dealing with zillions
of kernel patches sane. It is the only way I
successfully can maintain seven different kernel trees and
still have time to sleep.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Linus Torvalds contributed a stunner of a quote
to a BitKeeper company press release&mdash;&ldquo;It's made
me more than twice as productive&rdquo;, he said. As if
he was slow before. With that kind of testimonial,
BitKeeper deserves a slot in any company's search
for a new source code management system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a9580.0x11a2268"></a>
Database: PostgreSQL</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;I continue to love PostgreSQL and prefer it over
MySQL because of its features, stability, scalability,
Unicode compatibility and adherence to standards&rdquo;,
Reuven writes. &ldquo;That said, the MySQL team is making
impressive inroads, and I expect to see them close the
gap with PostgreSQL in the coming years. But for now,
I strongly recommend PostgreSQL to anyone who needs
a relational database.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Marcel concurs. &ldquo;PostgreSQL is still number one
for me&rdquo;, he writes. &ldquo;This is a grown-up, powerful
database, and the first I turn to when I need to
create or use database-enabled applications.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a9580.0x11a2528"></a>
Mobile Device: Sharp Zaurus SL-6000 PDA</h2></div></div><p>
The latest Zaurus is Ibrahim Haddad's choice.
Unlike previous Zauri, this one features USB host
support, so you can use it with your USB devices
for storage, networking and input. The screen is
a pixel-licious 480&times;640, four times the area of the
original Zaurus and the same as the Japan-only Zaurus
SL-C700 we reviewed last year.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a9580.0x11a2688"></a>
Game: Really Simple Syndication (RSS)</h2></div></div><p>
Our editors are all business and turned up their
noses at selecting favorite games. These are the kind
of people you want to hire to roll out your company
desktop systems. But even though it might not look
like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span> or <span   class="emphasis"><em>Frozen Bubble</em></span> when the boss walks by,
there's a new hit game that Linux people are playing
on the Net, and whether you want to call it blogging
or social software, players are everywhere.
It's like painting <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dungeons and Dragons</em></span> figures or
collecting baseball cards, but with real people.
</p><p>
The glue tying it all together is a simple XML-based
syndication format called RSS, which sites such as
Technorati and software projects such as Planet are
using to bring together Web content in new ways.
Who's a blog king and who's a bozo? Pop in to
Technorati to check the score.
</p><p>
Reuven points out that the all-in-one social network
sites LinkedIn, Orkut and Ryze aren't particularly
useful, but he says they're &ldquo;all scratching the surface
of something new and interesting.&rdquo; It gets really
interesting when social networking info crosses site
boundaries and anyone can crawl it. Game on!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a9580.0x11a29a0"></a>
Technical Book (tie): <span   class="emphasis"><em>Real-World XML</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Hacking the Xbox</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
Paul Barry called Andrew &ldquo;bunnie&rdquo; Huang's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hacking the
Xbox</em></span> &ldquo;a darned good read&rdquo; in our January 2004 issue.
The book is a matter-of-fact introduction to
current issues in making hardware do what you want and
not what fits into some company's business model.
</p><p>
Reuven writes that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Real-World XML</em></span> by Steven Holzner
is &ldquo;another big, thick book about XML, which doesn't
really need big, thick books. But it offers some good
explanations, sample code and discusses applications,
including SOAP.&rdquo;
</p><p>
If you're into well formed documents, get Huang's
book; if you're into well formed solder joints,
get Holzner's. Expand your mind.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a9580.0x159b010"></a>
Nontechnical Book: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Free Culture</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
Did some of the members of Beatallica want to be a
Beatles tribute band, while others wanted to be a
Metallica tribute band? We can't go see them perform
&ldquo;Got to Get You Trapped Under Ice&rdquo; and &ldquo;Everybody's
Got a Ticket to Ride Except for Me and My Lightning&rdquo;,
because Beatallica is in hiding for fear of record
company lawyers.
</p><p>
It wasn't always like this. Back when Walt Disney
directed <span   class="emphasis"><em>Steamboat Willy</em></span>, a parody of Buster
Keaton's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Steamboat Bill, Jr.</em></span>, copyright law was
different and encouraged creativity, not lawyer
bills.
Professor Lawrence Lessig, in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Free Culture</em></span>, explains
copyright in a way that will help you, the Linux and
Internet native, explain today's copyright issues
to people who are new to the whole sorry scene.
Lessig represents the often-ignored middle ground in
the copyright debate.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a9580.0x159b380"></a>
Technical Web Site: LWN</h2></div></div><p>
LWN wins again. We can say the same thing about this
site that we said last year: a great mix of links to
the best Linux stories from other sites, including
<i  >Linux Journal</i>'s, plus original technical content.
A recent series profiles the various free software
choices in calendars, image viewers and drawing
programs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a9580.0x159b4e0"></a>
Nontechnical or Community Web Site: Groklaw</h2></div></div><p> If you sold your TV when
<span   class="emphasis"><em>L.A. Law</em></span> went off the air,
this is the site for you. Get sucked in to the
courtroom drama surrounding failing UNIX vendor
The SCO Group, formerly Caldera, and the company's
long-shot lawsuits against AutoZone, Daimler-Chrysler,
IBM and Novell. Will SCO dodge a lawsuit from Red
Hat? Did Novell transfer UNIX copyrights to SCO?
Will Grace get back together with Victor? Greg says
Groklaw is &ldquo;now the home page for more IBM executives
than any other site.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a9580.0x159b698"></a>
Mailing List or Other Support Forum: linux-kernel List</h2></div></div><p>
Greg weighs in to support the linux-kernel mailing
list: &ldquo;It's high volume, oftentimes rude, but
always informative and never boring. And if a
user is willing to be nice, quite helpful&rdquo;, he says.
So be nice. Or else.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a9580.0x159b7f8"></a>
Project of the Year: Ardour</h2></div></div><p>
The digital audio workstation Ardour was the centerpiece of
the Linux-based recording studio in Aaron Trumm's
article in the May 2004 issue. In his column for the
<i  >Linux Journal</i> Web site, Dave Phillips wrote, &ldquo;Ardour
has become a center of attention for those of us who
wish to use Linux in a professional audio setting&rdquo;,
and &ldquo;That Ardour has come so far and evolved so well
is a testament to the talents and dedication of its
programming crew.&rdquo; Congratulations to Paul Davis
and the rest of the Ardour team.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a9580.0x159ba08"></a>
Product of the Year: EmperorLinux Toucan</h2></div></div><p>
Remember that IBM ThinkPad T41, the laptop everyone
likes? Doc bought his through EmperorLinux, a company
full of friendly people who set up major-brand laptops
with your distribution of choice, with a patched and
tested kernel that supports the laptop hardware.
Emperor sells its Linux-enabled T41 as the &ldquo;Toucan&rdquo;,
and it will set up the system with any of six different
distributions or dual-boot with a Microsoft OS.
Best of all, EmperorLinux is quick to reply to support
calls on Linux issues and the original manufacturer's
warranty remains in effect for the hardware.
</p><p>
Now that the T41 is a hit on the Linux scene, will
IBM sell EmperorLinux an OS-less version so Linux
customers don't have to pay for a legacy OS license?
Maybe if they knock off reading Groklaw for a few
minutes and do the deal, we'll get lucky next year.
