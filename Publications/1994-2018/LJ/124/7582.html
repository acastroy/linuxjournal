Follow along with the kernel hacker's actual
problem-solving process as the quest to add support
for a new device begins.

Day 1: I open the box to see a small USB device&mdash;no bigger
than a quarter&mdash;a CD and a note from my editor,
&ldquo;Make this work on Linux!&rdquo; &ldquo;Okay&rdquo;, I think,
&ldquo;this
should be easy.&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7582f1.large.jpg"><img src="7582f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. MARX Software Security's CrypToken
</p></div></div><p>
I plug the device in to my laptop and run a small
program called usbview to learn what the Linux
kernel thinks this device is (Figure 2). This
device must be calling itself a USB CrypToken, as
that is the string contained in the device.
Unfortunately, the device name is in red, which means
no kernel driver is bound to the device.
I either have to write one or find a way to
use libusb to talk to the device from user space (see
my article &ldquo;Writing a Real Driver&mdash;in User Space&rdquo;,
<i  >LJ</i>, June 2004, for more information about libusb).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7582f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. usbview identifies the device by vendor and product ID.
</p></div></div><p>
Not content to rely on pretty GUI programs, I poke
around in the /proc/bus/usb/devices file to get the
raw device information. The section that describes
this device looks like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
T:  Bus=01 Lev=02 Prnt=03 Port=02 Cnt=01 Dev#=  4 Spd=1.5 MxCh= 0
D:  Ver= 1.00 Cls=ff(vend.) Sub=00 Prot=ff MxPS= 8 #Cfgs=  1
P:  Vendor=0d7a ProdID=0001 Rev= 1.07
S:  Manufacturer=Marx
S:  Product=USB crypToken
C:* #Ifs= 1 Cfg#= 1 Atr=80 MxPwr= 16mA
I:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 0 Cls=ff(vend.) Sub=00 Prot=ff Driver=(none)
</pre>
</p><p>
Curious to know whether any other Linux user has tried
this device, I consult the Linux USB Working
Devices List (see the on-line Resources section). Plugging the vendor
ID of 0d7a in to the Quick Search field results in
no records found. Perhaps this project will take more work
than I thought.
</p><p>
Day 2: The CD, where did I toss it? I locate it and put it
in the drive and, look, there's a file called
linux.txt on it. Wow, a vendor that acknowledges
that Linux might be a viable operating system to
support&mdash;things sure have changed over the years.
After poking around further and reading the
documentation on the CD, I realize the device
is a small crypto token that can be used to do all
sorts of fun things, such as
read a unique serial number from the device (each device is
different),
encrypt data through the device with a 128-bit
key stored only in the device and
save data on the device in a secure storage area.
</p><p>
On the CD is a shared library that can be used
to talk to the USB device to allow a program to access
the functions provided by this device. Also
present is a small test program that shows how the
different library functions work. The library uses
libusb to talk directly to the device from
user space, which means that a kernel driver is not
necessary for this device.
The library's license does not allow it to
be used within a program that would be licensed under
the GPL, however, which is unfortunate for many potential uses.
I need to find some way to allow GPL programs to talk
to the USB device.
</p><p>
Day 3: While rummaging through my old collection of USB patches, I
dig up a reference to a developer who modified the
kernel usbfs core code to log all data that flows
through it. This patch would allow anyone to read the raw
USB data for any program that uses usbfs to talk to
a USB device. Because libusb uses usbfs to
communicate with USB devices, this might offer a way
to reverse engineer this device.
Unfortunately, the patch wasn't present with the
reference, and no amount of digging on the Internet
turned up any real code.
</p><p>
Day 4: As there is no available patch to do what I want to
do, I might as well do it myself. So, off to grab the
latest 2.6 kernel source tree and dive in.
</p><p>
The files inode.c, devices.c and devio.c in the
drivers/usb/core/ directory of the kernel source
tree implement the usbfs filesystem.
The main filesystem
code is in the inode.c file. It contains all of the
various VFS code that creates a virtual filesystem
and the virtual files within it. The file devices.c
handles the creation and reading of the
/proc/bus/usb/devices file. This file shows all USB
devices and information for those devices in the
system at the present time.
</p><p>
The file devio.c controls the raw access of USB
devices through the usbfs filesystem. For a
user-space program to talk to a USB device through
usbfs, it needs to use the ioctl() command on a file that
represents the USB device. All of the different
ioctl messages that can be sent to the USB devices
through usbfs are detailed in the
include/linux/usbdevfs.h file.
</p><p>
So, in order to log all accesses to all devices
through usbfs, the devio.c file should be modified.
Digging into the file, the function usbdev_ioctl
looked like the proper place to do this logging. It
is called for every ioctl call to a usbfs file.
Within that function is a big switch statement that
calls the proper functions, depending on the
different ioctl command. That is the perfect place
to log what kind of command was sent to the device.
So, I added a simple printk() call to each case
statement, causing them to look like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
...
case USBDEVFS_CLAIMINTERFACE:
  printk("CLAIMINTERFACE\n);
  ret = proc_claiminterface(ps, (void __user *)arg);
  break;

case USBDEVFS_RELEASEINTERFACE:
  printk("RELEASEINTERFACE\n");
  ret = proc_releaseinterface(ps, (void __user *)arg);
  break;
...
</pre>
</p><p>
A simple compile, install and module load later
confirmed that every usbfs access is now logged to
the kernel log, which can be seen by running the
dmesg program. I determined that running the
lsusb program as <tt  >lsusb -v</tt>
produced a lot of usbfs accesses as the program
retrieves all of the raw USB configuration data from
all devices.
</p><p>
Day 5: Now that the different kinds of usbfs accesses can
be noticed easily, it is time to log the data
these accesses generate. In looking at the
description of the device in the
/proc/bus/usb/devices file, it appears that I care only
about the accesses to the control endpoint,
because there are no endpoints assigned to this
device.
</p><p>
Digging further into the devio.c file, I determine
that the proc_control() function handles all control
messages. There, the code determines whether the request
is a read or write control message with the code:

<pre     class="programlisting">

if (ctrl.bRequestType &amp; 0x80) {

</pre>
</p><p>
The USB bRequestType variable is a bitfield, and
the uppermost bit determines the direction of the
request. So, in the read section of this if
statement I add the lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
printk("control read: "
       "bRequest=%02x bRrequestType=%02x "
       "wValue=%04x wIndex=%04x\n",
       ctrl.bRequest, ctrl.bRequestType,
       ctrl.wValue, ctrl.wIndex);
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d84580.0x1e7d0b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to log the control request information. After the
read has completed, I add the following lines to log
the actual data read from the device:

<pre     class="programlisting">

printk("control read: data ");
for (j = 0; j &lt; ctrl.wLength; ++j)
    printk("%02x ", ctrl.data[j]);
printk("\n");

</pre>
</p><p>
After doing much the same modification to the write
section of the if statement, I build, reload the
usbcore modules and verify that I now can log
all control messages to and from the device. The
messages returned are:


<pre     class="programlisting">
CONTROL
control read: bRequest=06 bRrequestType=80 wValue=0300 wIndex=0000
control read: data 00 00 61 63
</pre>
</p><p>
Day 6: Looking at the modifications I have made to the
kernel code, I think this work might be something
other users might like to have. So, it is time
to clean up the code to a state that the USB
maintainer might accept for the main kernel
source tree.
</p><p>
First, I recognized that the calls to printk() are
incorrect. All printk() calls must be accompanied by a proper
logging level. These logging levels are
added to printk calls by pre-appending the proper
KERN_ values to the message. The file
include/linux/kernel.h contains the following valid
values that must be used:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#define KERN_EMERG   "&lt;0&gt;" /* system is unusable               */
#define KERN_ALERT   "&lt;1&gt;" /* action must be taken immediately */
#define KERN_CRIT    "&lt;2&gt;" /* critical conditions              */
#define KERN_ERR     "&lt;3&gt;" /* error conditions                 */
#define KERN_WARNING "&lt;4&gt;" /* warning conditions               */
#define KERN_NOTICE  "&lt;5&gt;" /* normal but significant condition */
#define KERN_INFO    "&lt;6&gt;" /* informational                    */
#define KERN_DEBUG   "&lt;7&gt;" /* debug-level messages             */

</pre>
</p><p>
So, I change the printk calls in the usbfs_ioctl()
function from:

<pre     class="programlisting">
printk("CLAIMINTERFACE\n);
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d84580.0x1e7d4d0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
printk(KERN_INFO "CLAIMINTERFACE\n);
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d84580.0x1e7d630"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Now the kernel janitors should not complain about
improper printk() usage.
</p><p>
In looking further at the logging messages, however, it
is hard to determine for what exact device the
message is being logged. More information needs
to be added to the printk() calls. Luckily,
some macros already in the
include/linux/device.h file can help us.
They are the dev_printk() macro and its helper
macros, dev_dbg(), dev_warn(), dev_info() and
dev_err(). These macros all need an additional
pointer to a struct device variable, which allows
them to print out the unique device ID for the
message.
So I change the printk() calls again to look like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">

dev_info(&amp;dev-&gt;dev, "CLAIMINTERFACE\n");

</pre>
</p><p>
Then the control message printk() calls are changed
to:

<pre     class="programlisting">

dev_info(&amp;dev-&gt;dev, "control read: "
       "bRequest=%02x bRrequestType=%02x "
       "wValue=%04x wIndex=%04x\n",
       ctrl.bRequest, ctrl.bRequestType,
       ctrl.wValue, ctrl.wIndex);

dev_info(&amp;dev-&gt;dev, "control read: data ");
for (j = 0; j &lt; ctrl.wLength; ++j)
    printk("%02x ", ctrl.data[j]);
printk("\n");

</pre>
</p><p>
The printk calls that dump the data do not need to
be changed, as they still are printing on the same
line as the call to dev_info().
</p><p>
Now the log messages are much more informative,
looking like the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
usb 1-1: CONTROL
usb 1-1: control read: bRequest=06 bRrequestType=80 wValue=0300 wIndex=0000
usb 1-1: control read: data 00 00 61 63
</pre>
</p><p>
I can determine exactly what USB device is
being talked to, which helps me weed out the
messages for devices I do not care about.
</p><p>
Day 7: Oops, I now realize that if I expect this kernel
change to be accepted by the community, I had better
not always generate these messages. Otherwise,
everyone would have their system logs overflowing
with messages they do not care about. How
to log messages only when asked?
</p><p>
I first look into making a new kernel build
configuration option. A simple modification of the
drivers/usb/core/Kconfig file adding a new option
is simple, but in examining the required code changes,
I soon realize that wrapping all of the
new logging statements in a
#ifdef CONFIG_USBFS_LOGGING
statement would make the USB maintainer
reject my kernel patch. #ifdef
is not generally allowed within kernel code, as it
cuts down on readability and makes maintaining
the code over time almost impossible.
</p><p>
Instead, I look at making an option that can be changed at
runtime. I add the following lines of code to the
devio.c file:


<pre     class="programlisting">
static int usbfs_snoop = 0;
module_param (usbfs_snoop, bool, S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR);
MODULE_PARM_DESC (usbfs_snoop, "true to log all usbfs traffic");
</pre>
</p><p>
This adds a new module parameter to the main usbcore
module called usbfs_snoop. This can be seen after
building the code by running the modinfo program:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ modinfo usbcore
license: GPL
parm:    blinkenlights:true to cycle leds on hubs
parm:    usbfs_snoop:true to log all usbfs traffic
</pre>
</p><p>
By loading the module with the following line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
modprobe usbcore usbfs_snoop=1
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d84580.0x2275fb8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
the option can be enabled by the user.
</p><p>
I used the definition module_param() instead of the
old-style MODULE_PARM(), as this is the proper way to
describe module parameters in the 2.6 kernel. The
main difference is this definition has a third
parameter. This third parameter, if set to
something besides 0, causes the parameter to
show up in sysfs and allows a user to query and
modify the option while the module is loaded.
With this code included, the usbcore module's directory in
sysfs looks like:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls -l /sys/module/usbcore/
-r--r--r--  1 root root 4096 May 13 15:33 blinkenlights
-r--r--r--  1 root root 4096 May 13 15:33 refcnt
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 4096 May 13 15:33 usbfs_snoop
</pre>
</p><p>
The module now can be loaded as normal:

<pre     class="programlisting">
modprobe usbcore
</pre>
</p><p>
When I decide to turn on logging I simply
do:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo 1 &gt; /sys/module/usbcore/usbfs_snoop
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d84580.0x2276328"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and the kernel variable usbfs_snoop in the devio.c
file is changed on the fly.
</p><p>
Now that I can determine whether the user wants to print
out snooping messages, I need to modify the
dev_info() calls again. I create the following
macro to do this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#define snoop(dev, format, arg...)             \
    do {                                       \
        if (usbfs_snoop)                       \
            dev_info( dev , format , ## arg);  \
    } while (0)
</pre>
</p><p>
This macro tests the value of the usbfs_snoop
variable, and if true, the dev_info() line is
called. The macro is wrapped in a <tt  >do { } while
(0)</tt> statement to allow it to be used in any kind of
code without having to worry about any side
effects. All kernel macros containing more than one
line of code are written in this way for this reason.
For more details about this, read the kernel newbies
FAQ (see Resources).
</p><p>
I next change all previously added calls to dev_info()
to a call to snoop(), causing the code
to look like:

<pre     class="programlisting">

snoop(&amp;dev-&gt;dev, "control read: "
       "bRequest=%02x bRrequestType=%02x "
       "wValue=%04x wIndex=%04x\n",
       ctrl.bRequest, ctrl.bRequestType,
       ctrl.wValue, ctrl.wIndex);

</pre>
</p><p>
But where the data is printed out, the snoop() macro
does not work properly. I need to check the value
of the usbfs_snoop variable directly, wrapping the
code in an if statement:

<pre     class="programlisting">

if (usbfs_snoop) {
    dev_info(&amp;dev-&gt;dev, "control read: data ");
    for (j = 0; j &lt; ctrl.wLength; ++j)
        printk("%02x ", ctrl.data[j]);
    printk("\n");
}

</pre>
</p><p>
I'm happy, and hopefully the USB maintainer
also will be happy with the changes. I read how to
generate a proper kernel patch by consulting the
file Documentation/SubmittingPatches, generate a
diff file and e-mail it off.
</p><p>
We now have a way to snoop all usbfs traffic, which
can help us reverse engineer any device
that uses libusb to communicate with a USB device.
It also allows us to snoop any USB accesses from
a guest OS running in a VMware session, allowing the
possibility to reverse engineer Microsoft Windows
USB drivers much more easily.
But all of that has to wait until the next
column.
