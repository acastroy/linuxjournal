Do a search these days on the word &ldquo;farm&rdquo;
on your favourite database of open-source software
applications. You'll find that the result of your
quest turns up, at best, a handful of projects
related to server farms. This is fine for those of
you who like to cultivate a roomful of servers. But
what about conventional farms&mdash;the ones that are
used to raise animals and grow crops?
Without these kinds of real-world applications,
open source is having a hard time realizing its
potential within the developing world.
</p><p>
One would imagine that some of the greatest benefits
from using open source would be realized in the
world's poorest economies. The low cost, the ethos
of sharing and community and building upon the work
of others, make open-source methodologies perfectly
suited to environments where the practice of self-help
is not an option.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, a number of factors having nothing to
do with logic are starting to cause new impediments to
open-source growth in areas where it should be most
embraced. Having failed to blunt the advance of open
source through attacks on its quality, innovation,
performance or support, opponents have resorted
to the only weapon they have left (in abundance)&mdash;cash. Proprietary software vendors have been
opening their chequebooks to developing countries
and development agencies, in an attempt to blunt the
adoption of open source that would occur in a truly
neutral environment.
</p><p>
In February 2004, FOSSFA, the main African open-source
group, issued a clarion call warning to governments
of the long-term limitations of choice that could be
associated with some of these donations. Even the $1
billion in gifts promised by Microsoft alone
certainly would come back to the company many-fold if it
could maintain long-term dependence on its wares.
</p><p>
Meanwhile at the United Nations-sponsored World
Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) conference
in December 2003, original language that supported the use
of open-source software systematically was taken out
of ongoing drafts, until the final version merely
recognized the existence of different software
models. Although the negotiations that led to this
conclusion were done behind closed doors, most
sources suggested that the main arm-twisters against
support of open source were the US delegation and
the International Chamber of Commerce.
</p><p>
So how does the open-source world fight this
blatant use of handouts and secret deals to maintain
dependence? In this writer's opinion, the answer lies
amongst the pigs and cows and vegetables mentioned at
the beginning of this piece. Without the bankroll of
open source's opponents, the community is fighting
back using a tactic that no money can buy, with
benefits right down on the farm.
</p><p>
The energy and enthusiasm of the community can&mdash;and must&mdash;go
beyond commodity software, such
as operating systems and utilities, and into
job-specific applications that will take open source
from the university lab to the village. Providing
open-source systems and graphics software is of no
value to someone who can't use the technology to
sell more grain or fabric, or operate a school or
hospital. Offering this kind of software allows for
a turnkey open-source solution that can replace an
entire proprietary system, not merely small pieces
of it.
</p><p>
Think of a foundation with a structure similar
to that of the Open Source Development Labs but
creating software for dairy farms (as an example)
instead of the kernel. Programmers get paid, costs
of development are far below the cost of importing
proprietary solutions, and the local community
maintains a stake in both process and outcome.
The idea of such a model was well received at
the Idlelo conference earlier this year in Capetown,
and some African governments already have expressed
interest in supporting such foundations.
</p><p>
At the WSIS conference as well, community triumphed
over money. While the politicians and policy makers
were watering down the language of official documents,
open-source advocates still were finding receptive
ears amongst the delegates. The Linux Professional
Institute (LPI) booth at the adjoining ICT-4D tradeshow was one of the busiest amongst hundreds of
participants, drawing visitors from hours before the
show started to hours after it ended each day. The
LPI booth had 22 staff, coming from every continent,
and included three people from the Geneva Linux user
groups. This was a perfect way to demonstrate the
strength of a movement that was global but has roots
everywhere. The message taken away&mdash;as well as the
5,000 Debian and SuSE CDs given out&mdash;offered a bright
counterpoint to the dreary and generally pointless
policy work coming from the conference.
</p><p>
It is here&mdash;in our community's strength of local
grassroots, common ownership and self-reliance&mdash;that open-source technology makes the leap from
being simply an alternative to a compelling and
undeniable option. And, that particular strength can't
be bought or sold, at any price.
