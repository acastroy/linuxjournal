Hackers, who are not always crackers, deserve a little Agape.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13a7580.0x149f3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I was sanding down the hull of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Agape</em></span>, my sloop that
I sail from time to time, trying to get the boat ready for its
annual painting when one of the younger Pollywogs,
Yury, came up to me and complained that someone had called him a
&ldquo;hacker&rdquo;.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Why does that bother you?&rdquo; I asked.  &ldquo;I do not break
into other people's systems&rdquo;, Yury said.  &ldquo;I program, I
do systems administration and I help people a lot with their computer
problems.&rdquo;
</p><p>
I stopped sanding a bit and realized that Yury had confused the term
Hacker with Cracker.  It is easy to do, as the mass media has
done much to mix the two terms.
</p><p>
&ldquo;No Yury&rdquo;, I said.  &ldquo;A hacker is a fine name to be called, it is someone
who really knows programming, has studied it, enjoys doing it and shows
exceptional skill at solving difficult problems with elegant code.  Usually
that code is relatively short, what we call a quick hack.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Seeing me talking to Yury, more Pollywogs started coming up.  &ldquo;Then what
is a cracker?&rdquo; asked one of them.  &ldquo;A cracker&rdquo;, I
explained, &ldquo;is someone
that breaks into other people's systems, sometimes to do malicious damage,
like destroy their Web site, but often just to show people that their
sites or systems are insecure.&rdquo;
</p><p>
I went on to explain that there were two main types of crackers, those who were
extremely skilled and often very hard to detect without constant diligence
and those who were less skilled, often relying on techniques developed by
others, but applied to thousands or tens of thousands of systems over the
Internet.  Often these less skilled people are nicknamed script kiddies.
</p><p>
I also explained that in a lot of countries breaking into another person's
system is against the law, even if it is relatively easy and no damage
is done, and if the person is caught, there can be dire circumstances.
</p><p>
&ldquo;But why do these people break in?&rdquo; asked Yury, &ldquo;Sometimes it is for
financial gain&rdquo;, I explained, and I continued:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Sometimes it is to steal records or change data that will
bring some type of financial benefit to the cracker.  Sometimes it is to
see what other people are doing or to change their software so people
will inadvertently send the crackers information that will be useful
to them over time.  Sometimes it is just for the challenge of
breaking in, for peer respect of having &ldquo;done the deed&rdquo;.
</p><p>
A friend of mine named Marcelo Marques in Sao Paulo, Brazil, had been
talking to the Brazilian FBI.  They had empirical information that 80% of
computer crimes were being either initiated or helped by teenagers.
The FBI spokesman expressed frustration to my friend, because he could not
understand why these teenagers were doing these things.  Marcelo talked with
me about crackers and hackers, and after planning for a while, he and his
partners from 4Linux, a consulting firm in Sao Paulo, started a
program called Hackerteen (<a href="http://www.hackerteen.com.br" target="_self">www.hackerteen.com.br</a>), under the premise that
if you gave training to young people in how to be a really good systems
administrator, programmer and community member, you could turn potential
crackers into hackers.  So far, the program has been in existence for two years
and has graduated its first class of &ldquo;Black Belt&rdquo; students.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
&ldquo;Can anyone become a hacker?&rdquo; asked Yury.  I answered:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Well, there were a lot of young people who dropped out of Hackerteen along
the way.  The Hackerteen program is not an easy one.  It is made up of on-line
work, study and even on-site visits where the students are given courses in
ethics, entrepreneurship, computer security, networks, programming and
collaboration.  My personal experience tells me that not every
person can do programming.  I have taught for too many years to say that
every person has the gifts to become a top hacker.  Nevertheless, a course
set up like this can have a very positive effect on young programmers, and some
of these graduates now have jobs with companies.  I met with the first class
of graduates, and I could see what the class meant to both them and their
parents.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
&ldquo;Do you have to go to school or take a course to be a
hacker?&rdquo; asked Jay.
</p><p>
&ldquo;No&rdquo;, I answered, and I continued:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Lots of hackers I know are self-taught.  One of the
things that I like about free and open-source software is that there is
nothing hidden from those who wish to learn.  You can see other people's
code and learn from it.  There are plenty of books on the library shelves,
magazines to read, Internet mailing lists and news groups and
even electronic books to learn from.  Things are very different now than
from when I learned to code.
</p><p>
But some people find it difficult to learn by reading books, and some really
like to have a guide or mentor along the way.  Some do best with classroom
instruction, and some are held back by it.  My experience has been that a more
structured approach gives a more balanced person, but this does not mean that
you have to take a course or go to a school, you just have to define a path
for yourself and stick with it.  Some people find that difficult.
</p><p>
Ethics are particularly difficult, for what may be ethical for one person
may not be ethical for many others.  Here is where a lot of people may make
the wrong decisions without proper guidance.  If people think that ethics in
computers are easy, they should attend a session of the Ethics Working Group
of the SAGE Executive Committee.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
&ldquo;What about girls?&rdquo; asked another young Pollywog, sort of
crinkling his nose.
&ldquo;Can girls become hackers?&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;Definitely&rdquo;, I said, and added:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
One of my favorite people of all time, one of the
earliest programmers and one of the pioneers of the Cobol language was
Rear Admiral Dr Grace Murray Hopper.  Dr Hopper encouraged early programmers
to share common segments of code, reducing duplication of effort and errors.
</p><p>
In Malaysia, more than 70% of the people in data processing are women,
and not just in &ldquo;menial&rdquo; tasks, but with jobs of influence and power.
At my job in Bell Laboratories, my supervisor was a very talented woman by
the name of Bea Fink.  My observations have been that there is no inherent
differences between a man and a woman doing a job in the computer field.
As a former board member of the USENIX Association (<a href="http://www.usenix.org" target="_self">www.usenix.org</a>), I was
very proud of the work USENIX did with organizations encouraging women
to enter the field and acknowledging the women who contributed to it.
I also met many fine women who would indeed fit the definition of hacker
through USENIX and organizations like the ACM and IEEE.
</p><p>
Some of the Linux community has recognized the need to encourage women to
enter the computer science field and started groups like
LinuxChix (<a href="http://www.LinuxChix.org" target="_self">www.LinuxChix.org</a>); GNUrias (<a href="http://www.gnurias.org.br" target="_self">www.gnurias.org.br</a>), a
Brazilian/Portuguese organization; Debian Women (<a href="http://www.women.debian.org" target="_self">www.women.debian.org</a>); and
ChicasLinux (<a href="http://www.chicaslinux.org" target="_self">www.chicaslinux.org</a>), a Spanish
organization.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
&ldquo;But how do you know you are a hacker?&rdquo; asked Yury.
</p><p>
I had to sand the bottom of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Agape</em></span> for a while before answering him.  I had to
think of all the many fine programmers that I had known over the years, all
the people who were master craftspeople.  I thought about the lists of
hackers that I had seen, and the names on those lists.  Yet, I did not
remember any of these people referring to themselves, unless it was in a
passing comment, as a hacker.  Then I knew the answer for my young friend.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Yury&rdquo;, I said, &ldquo;you are probably a hacker when some programmer that you
respect as a good programmer calls you a hacker.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Agape</em></span> is almost ready to sail.
