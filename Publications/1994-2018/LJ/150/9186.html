Did MythTV get its name because the ability to install it easily is a
myth?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fff580.0x20f72f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I miss my TiVo.  I had one of the first TiVo units ever made, and I kept
it alive through various hardware failures and it still works today.
I replaced the existing drive with a 160GB drive, which gives me
virtually unlimited storage.  Then my television failed, so I picked
up a terrific bargain on an HDTV from <a href="http://www.newegg.com" target="_self">www.newegg.com</a>.  The TiVo will
work with this television, but it doesn't really do it justice.
</p><p>
So, I've decided to do something I've been meaning to do for years now.
I'm building a MythTV box on Linux, which will serve as a multipurpose
multimedia server and perhaps even take over the jobs of my aging
all-purpose storage and IMAP e-mail server.  I've put off this project
for a number of reasons.  I didn't want to invest in the extra hardware,
and from everything I've read it is time consuming (read: royal pain)
to get a MythTV box working.
</p><p>
All the testing I did for the Ultimate Linux Box issue left me with a
lot of extra hardware to play with.  So that problem was solved for me.
The only thing I had to purchase was a TV tuner card.  I went for the
Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-500MCE, which is basically two WinTV-PVR-150 tuners
on a single card.
</p><p>
The WinTV-PVR-500 doesn't do HDTV, but there aren't many HDTV channels
either.  So the plan is to create a synergy between the MythTV box and
my HDTV-capable cable box so I can get the best from both.  In most cases,
the MythTV box should change the channel on the cable box.
</p><p>
The first thing I did was test out the card in a PC I already had running,
namely a box with an ASUS M2N32-SLI motherboard for the socket AM2 AMD64 processor.  While I had the case open to install the Hauppauge card,
I took the opportunity to install some new DDR2 memory modules, which I
plan to test for speed improvements.  After that, the PC wouldn't even
boot to the setup screen.
</p><p>
I'd read that this motherboard is finicky about memory, thanks to BIOS
issues, so I used the old memory to download and install the latest
BIOS.  That fixed the memory problem, but now every distribution of Linux
I have crashed at boot time.  I get the MP-BIOS &ldquo;8254 timer not connected
to IO-APIC&rdquo; error that plagued some earlier Linux kernels.
Although this
may be a Linux kernel issue, it's more likely a problem with the new
BIOS.  I've never had a lot of luck with ASUS fixing BIOS bugs, so I hope
the kernel developers find a way to work around the problem.  Regardless,
I added noapic to the boot command, and now Linux boots again.
</p><p>
By this time, I decide I don't want to mess with the ASUS box, so I
build the computer with the slightly older, but still powerful hardware
I planned to use for MythTV.  The Knoppix distribution customized for
MythTV called KnoppMyth is almost impossible to install, and it doesn't
work when I get it installed.  Kubuntu 6.06 installs cleanly, but I make
the mistake of using a vanilla 2.6.17 kernel to add the Hauppauge drivers
(it requires ivtv drivers from <a href="http://dl.ivtvdriver.org" target="_self">dl.ivtvdriver.org</a> and firmware from
the Hauppauge site).  Vanilla kernels break numerous things in Kubuntu,
and the Hauppauge drivers simply won't compile properly anyway.
</p><p>
So I resign myself to using an existing Ubuntu/Kubuntu kernel.  I found
numerous how-to sites for getting the ivtv drivers working on Ubuntu 5,
but nothing for Ubuntu/Kubuntu 6.  Unfortunately, there are significant
differences between these versions.  The biggest difference is how the
two versions handle third-party firmware.  After experimenting for far
too long, I find the shotgun approach solves my problem.  I put copies of
the driver modules and firmware files just about everywhere, including
my sock drawer.  Finally, the modules load and the /dev directory is
now populated with the right devices.
</p><p>
I still have miles to go before I sleep, but the rest of the MythTV
installation looks pretty simple, at least on paper (or should I say
&ldquo;on pixels&rdquo;).  However, the above experience hammered home something I've
known about Linux and Linux distributions for a long time, but haven't
spoken enough about lately.  Almost every distribution has forked
the Linux kernel and much more to deliver on its specific goals for a
Linux distribution.  I hesitate to call this a bad thing, even though it
tends to rear its ugly head when you try to do something like install
the drivers for MythTV, because updated how-to instructions almost always
trail the release of new distributions by many months.
</p><p>
There are reasons why these distributions take such liberties.  The basic
foundation isn't good enough.  Those are fighting words, I know.  And I
will leave you hanging with that flame bait.  I have much more to say
on this topic next month.
