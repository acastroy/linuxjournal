Use H.264 to create high-quality, low-bitrate digital video
with currently available tools on Linux.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10fd580.0x11f5298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The impact of H.264 on the world of digital video compression is
growing.  Companies such as Apple are already switching wholeheartedly
to it.  As part of the MPEG-4 standard (part 10), H.264 is now a part
of both the HD-DVD and Blu-ray specifications for high-definition DVD.
And for good reason&mdash;H.264 can encode video using very low bitrates
while maintaining an incredibly high perceived quality.
</p><p>
Of particular interest are the low-bitrate possibilities this video
codec provides.  Luckily for those who run Linux, the H.264 codec (also
known as the Advanced Video Codec, or AVC) has a successful
and effective open-source implementation known as x264.  In fact,
the x264 Project won the Doom9 2005 codec comparison test (see the
on-line Resources).  x264
continues to make progress and improvements, and it remains an active
project.  So let's take advantage of what it offers us: an extremely
high-quality AVC encoding tool that can be used right away for DVD
and home movie backups, to create video clips for streaming over the
Web or simply for experimenting with the latest video encoding
technology.
</p><p>
The balance of this article focuses on the basic steps involved in
creating standard .mp4 files that contain H.264 video coupled with
AAC audio (Advanced Audio Codec, also an MPEG standard).  The
vagaries and subtle corners of hard-core video encoding are beyond the
scope of this discussion.  But hopefully, this introduction will
encourage you to explore the topic further.
</p><p>
Because both AVC and AAC are now MPEG standards, it stands to reason
that many tools (commercial and otherwise) are already available that
support it.  For example, Apple's QuickTime natively supports the
video files we will be creating.  And, MPlayer, the well-known and
successful open-source media player, also supports .mp4 playback.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10fd580.0x11f54a8"></a>
Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>
Creating a standards-compliant video file involves three basic steps:
the creation of the encoded video, the creation of the encoded audio
and the combination of those two things.  Here are the software tools
we need:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
MPlayer (includes mencoder, cvs version 060109 or higher)
</p></li><li><p>
faac 1.24 or higher
</p></li><li><p>
MP4Box (part of gpac 0.4.0 or higher)
</p></li><li><p>
x264 (compiled with gpac support)
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Our goal is to produce a low-bitrate video file suitable for
posting on the Web.  It will be a small file, but the quality will be
exceptional compared with a higher-bitrate XviD encoding.  Our source
video will be a home movie clip called max.dv, which is a nine-second
raw DV file captured directly from a digital video camera.
</p><p>
Let's process the audio first, as it is a pretty straightforward
operation.  The idea is first to have MPlayer dump the raw pcm audio
directly from our video source:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mplayer -ao pcm -vc null -vo null max.dv
</pre>
</p><p>
This produces a file called audiodump.wav.  The video portion of
the source file is ignored.  Now, encode this wave file to AAC:

<pre     class="programlisting">
faac --mpeg-vers 4 audiodump.wav
</pre>
</p><p>
The --mpeg-vers parameter specifies the MPEG version.  We now have the
audio portion of our work finished and can listen to
audiodump.aac by playing it with MPlayer.
</p><p>
When it comes to encoding the video, we are faced with several
options.  The highest quality encodes can be made only by using multiple
passes.  We actually process the source video twice (or more) in order
to allow the encoder to pick the best possible distribution of bits
across the destination file.  Using multiple passes also enables
us to pinpoint the bitrate and resulting file size of the
output.  However, encoding with an AVC encoder, such as x264, is very
processor-intensive and thus can run pretty slowly, so we may not
want to sit through a lengthy multipass encoding.  Instead, we could
run the encoding with one pass.  This still will produce outstanding
results, but never as good as a multipass encode.  We also give up the
possibility of targeting the resulting file size and bitrate.  It all
depends on what is most important to you, time or quality.
</p><p>
Fortunately, x264 provides a good middle ground.  An option exists to
specify a Constant Rate Factor (or Constant Quality), which instructs
x264 to take into account the differences between high- and low-motion
scenes.  Because your eye loses details in high-motion scenes anyway,
x264 uses fewer bits in those spots so that it can allocate them
elsewhere, resulting in a much improved overall visual quality.  This
mode allows the highest quality possible without using multiple
passes, which is a great time saver.  The cost in using this mode,
however, is in giving up the ability to determine the final file size
and bitrate.  Although this is possible with multiple passes, we would be
forced to double the encoding time.  So for our example, let's stick
with one pass, utilizing the Constant Rate Factor feature (--crf) for
greatly improved quality.  Good values of the Constant Rate Factor
range between approximately 18 and 26 (where a lower value produces
higher quality but larger file sizes).  Your needs in terms of size
vs.  time vs.  quality may be different, however.  If so, you should
investigate multipass mode further to gain more control.
</p><p>
The x264 encoder accepts only raw YUV 4:2:0 input.  To do this,
simply pipe the output of mencoder directly into x264:

<pre     class="programlisting">

mkfifo tmp.fifo.yuv
mencoder -vf format=i420 -nosound -ovc raw -of rawvideo \
    -ofps 23.976 -o tmp.fifo.yuv max.dv 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; /dev/null &amp;
x264 -o max-video.mp4 --fps 23.976 --crf 26 --progress \
    tmp.fifo.yuv 720x480
rm tmp.fifo.yuv

</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, we must specify the framerate (--fps); otherwise x264
will not know what is being fed into it.  Do this similarly for the width and
height of the incoming raw video.  Encoding in this way enables
the x264 default encoding parameters, which are quite good, but
we can make a few improvements.  In particular, we can make
general improvements to some of the encoding strategies it uses
without sacrificing too much in the way of extra encoding time.  The
number and variability of the parameters you can feed into x264 is
great, and they are all geared toward improving the quality of the
resulting output in some way.  However, some options are more
expensive, time- and processor-wise, than others.  And, some options
can sacrifice compatibility with certain media players, notably
QuickTime.  In order to remain compatible with the existing install
base of QuickTime users, we need to keep a few things in mind.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10fd580.0x11f5c90"></a>
QuickTime and H.264</h2></div></div><p>
It is nice that QuickTime 7 supports H.264-encoded video.  Apple
itself encodes all of its movie trailers on-line using H.264.
Although this is good, and fosters the adoption of this codec, the
QuickTime implementation has some limitations, most notably with
B-Frames and Profile support.  We need a short detour to explain what
this means for our encoding project.
</p><p>
The MPEG standard for H.264 includes a number of profiles, such as
Baseline, Main, Extended and High.  These profiles delineate different
technical capabilities that a decoder may need to possess.  As its
name suggests, the Baseline profile is the simplest and least-demanding
profile, and Main, Extended and High require more
processing power and the interpretation of more technical features in
order to decode properly.  QuickTime 7 supports Baseline and parts of
the Main profiles; however, it chokes on features of the Extended
and High profiles.
</p><p>
B-Frames are a type of storage format for digital video.  These types
of frames reference information from other previously decoded frames
in order for the decoder to do its job properly, which is to decode
the video.  B-Frames are interleaved amongst other frame types known as
I-Frames and P-Frames.  It's a technical detail, but the QuickTime 7
H.264 decoder can support only up to two B-Frames, no more.  This is
unfortunate, because using more B-Frames would let us increase
quality under some circumstances.
</p><p>
To remain QuickTime-compatible, we need to keep these limitations in
mind.  However, the quality of our low-bitrate encoding will not really
suffer that much, even with these limitations.  And, we can enable a few
additional options to improve things quite a bit.
The first is the subpixel motion estimation (--subme) size, which
controls the precision of motion estimation calculations used by x264
during the encoding process.  By increasing this to 6, the maximum, we
gain a lot of visual quality at the cost of some additional encoding
time, but it is worth it.  We also can configure how x264 analyzes
frames to perform better motion estimation (--analyse), which
leads to higher-quality encodes.  Note that some types of analysis are
for High profile encodings only, such as 8x8 DCT, which are not
supported by QuickTime, so we avoid those settings.  We also
can disable PSNR calculations (--no-psnr) to buy back a little speed
during the encode.  PSNR is simply a quality measurement and has no
effect on the actual encoding quality.
</p><p>
Putting all this together, we can now output a high-quality,
low-bitrate, QuickTime-compatible and standards-compliant video
encoding using H.264:

<pre     class="programlisting">

mkfifo tmp.fifo.yuv
mencoder -vf format=i420 -nosound -ovc raw -of \
    rawvideo -ofps 23.976 -o tmp.fifo.yuv \
    max.dv 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; /dev/null &amp;
x264 -o max-video.mp4 --fps 23.976 --bframes 2 \
    --progress --crf 26 --subme 6 --analyse \
    p8x8,b8x8,i4x4,p4x4 --no-psnr tmp.fifo.yuv 720x480
rm tmp.fifo.yuv

</pre>
</p><p>
We can make further improvements.  Because this video file is
destined for the Web, we most likely want to reduce the frame
size to something more friendly, possibly crop out unwanted areas, and
make other adjustments.  For example, to reduce the frame size, run the
following commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">

mkfifo tmp.fifo.yuv
mencoder -vf scale=480:320,format=i420 -nosound -ovc \
    raw -of rawvideo -ofps 23.976 -o tmp.fifo.yuv \
    max.dv 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; /dev/null &amp;
x264 -o max-video.mp4 --fps 23.976 --bframes 2 \
    --progress --crf 26 --subme 6 --analyse \
    p8x8,b8x8,i4x4,p4x4 --no-psnr tmp.fifo.yuv 480x320
rm tmp.fifo.yuv

</pre>
</p><p>
Here we instruct mencoder to scale the output to 480x320 and also
tell x264 to accept that frame size.  This will further reduce the
file size, which is appropriate for video on the Web.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10fd580.0x11f6058"></a>
Final Steps</h2></div></div><p>
Based on the QuickTime format, the .mp4 container format can store
many types of media and is also the MPEG standard for storing H.264
video and AAC audio, which is how we will be using it.  Use MP4Box,
which is part of the gpac project, to combine the audio and video streams we've
just created:

<pre     class="programlisting">
MP4Box -add max-video.mp4 -add audiodump.aac \
   -fps 23.976 max-x264.mp4
</pre>
</p><p>
This produces the final output file max-x264.mp4.  You can play back
the file with MPlayer, or with Apple's QuickTime player on a non-Linux
OS.  You also can embed this file into a Web page for playback from a
browser by using Apple's instructions for embedding QuickTime
movies (see Resources).  Free software tools such as the mplayer-plugin can be
used to play this file from within Firefox on Linux.
</p><p>
By way of comparison, here are the file sizes and bitrates of the
original raw DV file max.dv, our H.264-encoded file max-x264.mp4
and a corresponding XviD encoding max-xvid.avi, which was created
from the same source video (see Resources):


<pre     class="programlisting">
mencoder max.dv -vf scale=480:320 -ovc xvid -xvidencopts \
   fixed_quant=7:qpel:nopacked -oac mp3lame \
   -ofps 24000/1001 -o max-xvid.avi
</pre>

</p></div></div><p>
As you can see, the visual quality of the H.264-encoded file is just
as high as the XviD version, arguably higher, but at a lower bitrate
and file size.  This shows that you can achieve similar results in less
space, or much better results in the same space, with H.264 compared
to other codecs such as XviD.  In addition, the work flow and options
for encoding with x264 are similar to XviD, but with greatly
improved output.  So, if you are used to encoding with XviD, many of the
concepts and options should be familiar to you when working with x264.

</p></div></div><p>
The more you experiment with x264, the more you will discover the
amazing savings in bitrates and file sizes while still maintaining an
extremely high visual quality.  The world of video encoding is
definitely a black art, as there are hundreds of variables and options
that can be brought to bear in any particular encoding project.
There is no one-size-fits-all method of video encoding.  However, the
technical superiority of H.264 over XviD or regular MPEG-2-encoded
video is too great not to take advantage of it.  And, you can start taking
advantage of it today, using the tools described above.  Because H.264 is
an MPEG-standard encoding, used with an MPEG-standard audio codec
inside of an MPEG-standard container format, all the work you invest
in using these tools to encode your video will be future-proof as well
as high-quality.  Use the techniques outlined above as a starting point
for your own H.264-encoding projects, and you'll discover why H.264 is
becoming the next standard for video encoding.
