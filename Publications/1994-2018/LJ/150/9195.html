<span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning Maya 7: Foundation with DVD</em></span> by Autodesk Maya Press
(Sybex)</h2></div></div><p>
Those of you who follow this section will wonder why products in the
high-end 3-D graphics space keep popping up.  Admittedly, your editor's
dream to work for Pixar has (foolishly) not yet been dashed.  This month,
we'll see a new book title about Autodesk's Maya package, titled
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning
Maya 7: Foundation with DVD</em></span>.  The book is authored by Maya's creators at
Autodesk and published by Sybex's Autodesk Maya Press imprint.  Maya is a
powerful program used by the film, TV and computer/video game industries
for 3-D modeling, animation, effects and rendering.  And, Maya runs on Linux
as well.  This full-color book uses a real, forthcoming Hollywood film
as material for its tutorials, teaching readers animation, modeling,
texturing and visual effects.  Also included is a DVD with instructor-led
tutorial videos and other extra features.  (Psst! Anyone out there with
connections at Pixar who can hook me up?)

Vyatta's Open Flexible Router</h2></div></div><p>
The word vyatta means &ldquo;open&rdquo; in ancient Sanskrit, and this relatively
new company that has taken on the moniker is applying this philosophy of
openness to routers.  Vyatta's product, the Open Flexible Router (OFR), is
reputed to be the IT industry's first enterprise-grade, open-source router
platform.  OFR allows users to utilize industry-standard x86 hardware to
&ldquo;create a high-performance router for WAN and LAN routing&rdquo; that offers
&ldquo;dramatically improved price/performance and open
   flexibility&rdquo; vis-&agrave;-vis
closed-source solutions.  Vyatta targets OFR at mid-sized enterprises
or branch offices of larger ones.  Product benefits include not only all
standard routing protocols and high-availability and security features,
but also the ability to customize the product and add features as needed.
The latter is intended to give users flexibility in managing future
requirements on their own terms rather than relying on the actions of
closed-source vendors.  In addition, both free and paid support options
exist.  Free support comes in the form of the Vyatta Community, which
includes tools, discussions, blogs and newsfeeds.  Paid support includes
tiered subscription packages customized to the user's needs.  The OFR
software is available for free from Vyatta's Web site.

SageTV's Media Center for Linux</h2></div></div><p>
Hear ye, hear ye, all TV freaks! SageTV recently released a product
dubbed SageTV Media Center, which, according to the the company, allows
you to turn a Linux-based computer into a full-featured PVR and media
center.  In addition, you can utilize the Placeshifter option to watch
your entire home-based media library from any remote computer with
high-speed Internet access.  Furthermore, the Media Center also
can interact with SageTV's related product, the Wireless Media Extender,
which allows every TV in the home to access all live or recorded media
content from the Media Center independently without a need for a PVR on
each set.  Meanwhile, a central, unified media library is maintained.
SageTV claims that one can set up a complete, full-home media center for
hundreds rather than thousands of dollars for other solutions, and there
is no need to pay subscription fees for PVR capabilities.

Sage Software's Sage Accpac ERP</h2></div></div><p>
Sage Software (no relation to SageTV above) recently announced
a new version, now Release 5.4, of its Sage Accpac ERP business
management system.  In essence, Sage Accpac ERP is a Web-enabled
accounting and business management solution for integrated business
management applications, including CRM, POS, HR, inventory management and
so forth.  It can be deployed either on-site or on-line.  New user features in
Version 5.4 include a new returns management (RMA) module and 267 other
product enhancements, such as improved multi-currency tax accounting.
A new technical feature of Accpac ERP is its compatibility with
Intel and AMD 64-bit processors.  Also of interest to the Linux crowd
is the ability of Sage Accpac ERP to run simultaneously on both Linux
and Windows clients in parallel against the same database, be it DB2,
Oracle, PSQL or Microsoft SQL.

FiveRuns' Systems Management</h2></div></div><p>
FiveRuns, whose name comes from the founder's favorite childhood fishing
hole, has left the world of beta releases (now 1.0) with its open-source
Systems Management product, &ldquo;complete with Web 2.0 richness and
usability.&rdquo; According to FiveRuns, its &ldquo;approach to systems management
utilizes open-source technologies, such as Ajax, Ruby and Ruby on Rails
to deliver a sleek, hosted application.&rdquo; Because IT professionals must
typically manage both open-source and proprietary environments, FiveRuns'
philosophy is to support these heterogeneous environments through a
single interface.  FiveRuns also claims that businesses of all sizes can
benefit from its products.  Other features include software-as-a-service-based monitoring, allowing users the flexibility to subscribe to the
appropriate level of service as infrastructure levels change, as well
as automated configuration discovery and auto-baseline thresholds to
keep implementation time to a minimum.  Free support for the product
is available through FiveRuns.net, a community of users that includes
troubleshooting advice.  A free 30-day trial of FiveRuns is available by
signing up on the company's Web site.

now Release 6.2, which supports Linux, Mac OS and Windows.  The product

syncing; Sticky Note support (users can create and sync Sticky Notes
in WebMail and Outlook); Clam AntiVirus plugin; and improved search,

Roaring Penguin Sofware's CanIt-Domain-Pro</h2></div></div><p>
The developers of e-mail applications are rockin' these days, and one
of the companies responsible for the buzz is Roaring Penguin Software,
who just released Version 1.0 of its CanIt-Domain-Pro.  This product
is an antispam solution designed specifically for organizations with
complex e-mail needs related to managing multiple domains, such as ISPs,
universities, governments, Web hosts and so on.  Roaring Penguin says its
product can solve problems in universities and governments &ldquo;where each
department often has its own domains&rdquo; or in the ISP world where
&ldquo;merger
activity has brought multiple domains under one roof&rdquo;.  Roaring Penguin's
approach is to simplify the management of multiple domains by allowing a
&ldquo;super system administrator to delegate system administration
rights&rdquo; to
lower-level &ldquo;realms&rdquo;, with realm administrators able to create baseline
rules, users and streams within their jurisdictions.  CanIt-Domain-Pro is
available as a software download, a soft appliance or a preconfigured
plug-and-play appliance.
