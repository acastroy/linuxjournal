You need to free your mind, Neo.

I started working full-time for <i  >Linux Journal</i> in 1999, when we were
headquartered in the Ballard District of Seattle&mdash;a place I still miss
visiting.  One day, we took a break and headed over to a local theater
where <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Matrix</em></span> was showing.  It was early April, and the movie had
just come out.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Matrix</em></span> immediately became my favorite movie of all time.  Which is
saying a lot, as I'm now 59 years old, and I've seen a lot of movies.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Matrix</em></span> doesn't have the best acting or direction.  It did break new
ground in special effects, but so did many lesser movies.  In its many
fight and chase scenes, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Matrix</em></span> and its sequels are derivative of
countless other products of Hollywood and Asia.  (Yes, they were fun and
over the top, if you're into that stuff, but they were still derivative,
and some of the scenes go on forever.) What made <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Matrix</em></span> powerful
and important was its exceptionally strong metaphor for closed systems
that become so familiar and comfortable we fail to realize
they treat us like cattle&mdash;or worse, as disposable batteries.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Matrix</em></span> and its two sequels tell a familiar sci-fi story: a small
rebel force overthrows an oppressive and overpowering empire.  In this
case, the setting is a future Earth in which machines and their programs
have defeated and enslaved almost the entire human race.  In this future
world, nearly every human is trapped in a vast power plant where each
individual serves as a source of electrical power for the machines.  The
movie's setting&mdash;the apparently real world of 1999&mdash;is in fact a
collective illusion programmed and maintained by machines of vast
intelligence.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, a population of free humans lives deep underground in a city
called Zion and sends hovercrafts to sneak through abandoned sewers,
where they can hack into The Matrix and free human prisoners who
correctly suspect that something is not right with the only world
they've known.  It's not worth going further into the details of the
movie.  I'd be surprised if more than a handful of <i  >Linux Journal</i> readers
haven't seen it.  What matters is what we gain from it.
</p><p>
I gained a realization that The Matrix was a metaphor for marketing.  For
me this was personal.
</p><p>
When I began writing for <i  >Linux Journal</i> in 1996 (as a contributing
editor), I was fairly new to Linux and to the free software and
open-source concepts that Linux embodies.  But I had been working in
marketing&mdash;mostly advertising and PR&mdash;for two decades.  For a stretch of the
late 1980s and early 1990s, Hodskins Simone &amp; Searls was one of the top
high-tech advertising agencies in Silicon Valley.  When I left the agency,
I went on to become a successful marketing consultant.  So I knew how the
sausage was made.
</p><p>
Oddly, marketing (including advertising and PR) is not as powerful as
you might think.  Given the extraordinary inefficiencies involved, the
actual influence exerted by marketing (and by advertising and PR in
particular), is remarkably small.  Even the accountabilities introduced
with pay-per-click advertising still involve ratios of
&ldquo;impressions&rdquo; to
clicks that run in the lottery range.
</p><p>
Far more powerful is a belief, held by nearly everybody in the developed
world, that the best markets are captive ones.  In the Free Software and
Open Source movements we call captive markets &ldquo;walled
gardens&rdquo; or
&ldquo;silos&rdquo;.  But to most producers in the developed world, these are ideal.
And to most consumers, they are business as usual.
</p><p>
Even after the Net obsoleted closed on-line systems, Yahoo, AOL and
Microsoft continued to silo instant messaging inside their own walled
gardens.  In 2006, there should be no excuse for this.
</p><p>
Yet there is.  We continue to believe, as both producers and consumers,
that silos are okay.  And worse, that a &ldquo;free&rdquo; marketplace is one where
you get to choose the best silo.
</p><p>
We see this in the US today with our &ldquo;choice&rdquo; of services from phone
and cable carriers.  We even think the Net itself is a grace of telecom
and cablecom carriage.  After all, those are the guys we pay to get it.
Those are the guys who have gradually increased our connection speeds.
</p><p>
Even the most broad-minded techies can get trapped inside the conceptual
silo constructed by the telecom and cablecom carriers.  As I write this,
the debate over &ldquo;Net Neutrality&rdquo; is conducted almost entirely inside
that silo.
</p><p>
The carriers claim to be fighting government regulation, when in fact
they have known life only inside a regulatory habitat they built
themselves and continue to control through an exceptionally powerful
lobbying apparatus.  Together with the lawmakers and regulators they
control, the carriers have created what Bob Frankston (a father of both
the spreadsheet and home networking) calls the Regulatorium.
</p><p>
The Regulatorium provides the building codes for telecom and cablecom
silos.  Telecom (including cablecom) &ldquo;reform&rdquo; is entirely about changing
the building codes to make the silos more competitive with each
other&mdash;not to free the captives of those silos or to blow the silos up altogether.
</p><p>
To the Regulatorium, a &ldquo;free market&rdquo; for Internet service means you get
to choose between a cable and a telephone provider.  That's it.  These
carriers can no more appreciate a truly free market than an agent in The
Matrix can imagine a world not run by machines.
</p><p>
Carriers naturally oppose &ldquo;Net Neutrality&rdquo; because they've never
provided it and don't want to start.  No household customer of cable or
ADSL service has ever experienced symmetrical, uncrippled service.  For
most of those same customers, the Internet is a secondary service
offered alongside telephone or cable-TV services.  As with human
batteries inside The Matrix, a choice between two captors is all these
customers have ever known.  (Mobile telephony in the US is a little
better, because there are more competing silos.  But they're still silos.
And not very open.)
</p><p>
On the other side of the debate are techies led by Google, Yahoo,
Microsoft and other &ldquo;content providers&rdquo;, all fighting for Net Neutrality
inside the Regulatorium: the carriers' home turf.  The techies want the
silo maintainers to play fair with Net traffic passing to captive
customers inside the silos.
</p><p>
Regardless of how one defines &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo;, locating the argument inside
the Regulatorium requires admitting that the Net is a grace of silo'd
carriage.  Even pleas to restore &ldquo;common carriage&rdquo; (an enforced
indifference by carriers to the contents or passengers they carry) serve
to reify the silo'd nature of the carriers.  In effect, these pleas say,
&ldquo;Because we are captive, and because you have no motivation to treat us
all fairly, we must insist upon regulations that force you to do
that.&rdquo;
(Not surprisingly, this appeals to Democrats while offending
Republicans, guaranteeing defeat in a Republican-majority Congress.)
</p><p>
One recent evening, I was explaining Net Neutrality to my wife, giving
her a rundown of the various combatants in the debate and how they were
doing.  She listened patiently and replied on a level so high it reduced
all the silos below to the dimensions of molecules.  She said,
&ldquo;We're in the middle of a 100-year transition from analog to digital
technology.  That means we'll have another fifty years of prosperity
and growth.&rdquo;
</p><p>
I realized instantly that the Net is not just about TCP or Neutrality or
peer-to-peer or end-to-end or anything other than connecting digital
devices across distances.  It's about reducing those distances to
zero&mdash;or as close to zero as possible.  &ldquo;The Internet is just a
path&rdquo;, Bob
Frankston says.  And carriers, so far, have existed to create &ldquo;billing
events&rdquo; in the middle of that path.
</p><p>
In &ldquo;0 to 1 in 100 Years&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/1000056" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/node/1000056</a>), an
essay I wrote for the <i  >Linux Journal</i> Web site in July
2006, I said this:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
&ldquo;Broadband&rdquo; is like &ldquo;long distance&rdquo;: just another name for transient
scarcity.  We want our Net to be as fast, accessible and unrestricted
as a hard drive.  (And in time even that analogy will seem too slow.)
</p><p>
The only way that will happen is if the Net becomes ubiquitous
infrastructure&mdash;something which, in a practical sense, nobody
owns, everybody can use and anybody can improve
(<a href="http://worldofends.com/#BM_8" target="_self">worldofends.com/#BM_8</a>).
</p><p>
There is infinitely more business in making that happen, and using
the results, than Congress can ever protect for the carriers alone.
</p><p>
And guess who is in the best position to make money doing that?
Right: the carriers.
</p><p>
Will somebody please tell them?
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Of course that's a red herring.  Telling something like that to a carrier
is like telling an android to get a real body.  Carriers can't do it.
They're inside, not outside.  They're a bus with a billing system.
</p><p>
You have to be free to see how absurd silos can be.  You have to see
markets as wide-open spaces opened by ubiquitous relationships, and
potential relationships, between digital devices and the human beings
who use them.  You have to see unrestricted possibilities for the people
and organizations putting those devices, their applications and their
data to work.  Those possibilities lose their limits once you set your
mind free of the notion that a free market is just a choice of
silos.
</p><p>
So.  What does it mean to be free?
</p><p>
Richard M. Stallman and the Free Software Foundation have something to
say, at least in respect to software:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Free software is a matter of the users' freedom to run, copy,
distribute, study, change and improve the software.  More precisely,
it refers to four kinds of freedom, for the users of the software:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).
</p></li><li><p>
The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to
your needs (freedom 1).  Access to the source code is a
precondition for this.
</p></li><li><p>
The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your
neighbor (freedom 2).
</p></li><li><p>
The freedom to improve the program, and release your
improvements to the public, so that the whole community
benefits (freedom 3).  Access to the source code is a
precondition for this.
</p></li></ul></div></blockquote></div><p>
The cognitive linguist George Lakoff has come out with a new book,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Whose Freedom? The Battle Over America's Most Important
Idea</em></span>.  In a
chapter titled &ldquo;Why Freedom is Visceral&rdquo;, he says:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Freedom requires access&mdash;to a location, to an object, or to the
space to perform an action.  Access is a crucial idea in human
thought....Freedom requires not just the absence of impediments to
motion, but also the presence of access.  Inhibiting freedom is,
metaphorically, not just throwing up roadblocks, holding one back,
taking away power, imposing burdens or threats or harm, but also
failing to provide access.  Freedom thus may require creating access,
which may involve building.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
I've said countless times that Linux (and the whole LAMP stack, which
now potentially includes more than a hundred thousand components) is just
building material.  Its primary value is not in itself, but in what it
makes possible&mdash;in what I call the &ldquo;because effect&rdquo;.  Far more money is
made <span   class="emphasis"><em>because</em></span> of Linux than <span   class="emphasis"><em>with</em></span> it.  Same goes for all kinds of other
ordinary things, including buildings, cars and cell phones.  The
difference is that Linux was created in the first place with freedom as
a primary purpose.  So are countless other examples of free and open-source software.  So is the Net.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Free software is about free speech, not free beer&rdquo;, the Free Software
Foundation says.  In the same way, free markets are about free
enterprise.  In a free market, participants have the freedom to make and
sell and service whatever they want.  Free and open-source building
components are commodities by intent.  The abundance of a commodity may
drive down prices for itself, but it also drives up the number and
variety of purposes to which it can be put, and therefore drives up the
number and variety of businesses it makes possible.  When a commodity is
free as in beer as well as free as in speech, the sum of business it
makes possible is infinite.  Yes, some of those businesses may be silos.
But after a while, it becomes clear that the cost of maintaining silos is
exceeded by the benefits of freedom&mdash;for everybody involved.
</p><p>
In <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Matrix Reloaded</em></span>, the hero of the story, Neo, meets the
architect of The Matrix.  With the hauteur and condescension of a stuffy
college professor, the architect leads Neo to a conclusion.
&ldquo;Choice&rdquo;,
Neo says.  &ldquo;The problem is choice.&rdquo; The architect agrees, and presents
Neo with two choices, each leading to a determined outcome.  Neo doesn't
agree.  He sees more possibilities than the architect, because Neo is
human.  He is not a program.  He is capable of creation at a level
machines cannot achieve, no matter how intelligent they may be.  Human
beings can be profoundly creative, and vastly original.
</p><p>
With original technologies, we can be exceptionally good at opening
possibilities, at multiplying choices.  This is what we do with free and
open-source software.
</p><p>
What we do <span   class="emphasis"><em>with</em></span> Linux is also what we want
<span   class="emphasis"><em>from</em></span> it.  Both are about
choice.  You can't get full openness to possibilities&mdash;and choices
among them&mdash;without full access to source code, and the freedom to
improve that code as well as put it to use.  In the techie world, we know
about the virtues involved, and the effects as well.
</p><p>
But there is another path of access to sources that needs to be opened.
This is the one between users and engineers&mdash;between the people who
use code and the people who write it.  The same goes for makers of
hardware and nonsoftware products.  In fact, just about everything.  Yes,
there are trade secrets and recipes and drug formulas and other kinds of
stuff for which one can justify isolating creators from users.  But in
most cases, creators and users can benefit far more from interaction than
from isolation.
</p><p>
In the free world we're building, isolation of creators is also becoming
increasingly impractical.  What David Weinberger called &ldquo;Fort
Business&rdquo;&mdash;the building with the working space isolated inside physical as well
as digital firewalls; the badges for employees, the escorts for
visitors, the nondisclosure agreements for contractors&mdash;is becoming
more anachronistic and absurd by the minute.  Workers operate in the
outside world as well as the inside one.  Information customarily kept
secret may prove to be more valuable in the open.
</p><p>
It is still common in Silicon Valley to see, in the vast empty cubicle
farms of failed companies, posted warnings not to let secrets out of the
building.  This is the kind of insanity we have come to expect from
marketing: a category of activity that works to control customers on the
outside and creativity on the inside.
</p><p>
Marketing, advertising and PR have lots of warm BS about the good that
they do.  But the verbs give away their true intentions.  Marketers want
to &ldquo;grab&rdquo;, &ldquo;capture&rdquo; and &ldquo;hold&rdquo; people's attention.  Customer
&ldquo;Relationship&rdquo; Management (CRM) systems are mostly devoted to Silo
Inhabitant Retention.
</p><p>
Yes, I know that's wrong and unfair and not even close to marketing's
ideals.  But there is one good reason why customers hate advertising,
journalists hate PR and engineers hate marketing.  Put simply, it gets in
the way.
</p><p>
In most companies, marketing stands between users and engineers.
Obstruction may not be formal, but it's there.  We have this
notion&mdash;programmed, Matrix-like, into Business As Usual&mdash;that says we need
marketing to guide creation on the inside and to produce demand on the
outside.  We envision a process of product (or service) creation and
sales that works in a linear, value-chain way.  Feedback from the market
comprises the return side of a cycle that needs to be formalized and run
through a System.  Marketing is in charge of that.  Engineers aren't.
They're back at the beginning of a process that doesn't involve them
directly with customers or users.  That's up to sales, marketing,
customer support or some other non-engineering part of the corporate
bureaucracy.
</p><p>
That whole mentality is a silo too.  Maybe even a Matrix.  Because we're
trapped inside it, and we need to free our minds from it.
</p><p>
Survival and prosperity for technical companies in the long run will
require more and more contact between makers and users.  As with the
trapped inhabitants of The Matrix, we need to start over in a new world
that lacks the familiar comforts of the old one.  There was comfort in
the distance put by the silo between engineer and user.  The engineer
could work in peace.
</p><p>
But that distance is gone.  That peace is gone.  We have to make a new
world where we know first-hand how our stuff works for real customers
and real users.  We need to engage and relate.  Reports from marketing on
studies and focus groups aren't going to cut it anymore.  We'll need to
know more and more on a first-hand basis.
</p><p>
Of course, engineers will still enjoy their privileged positions.  &ldquo;Show
me the code&rdquo; will always be the base price of admission to the software
meritocracy.  But meritocracies will be built on meritocracies.  More
products, more services, more possibilities, more choices, more
opportunities, more value and more money.  For everyone involved.
</p><p>
Code comes down to ones and zeros.  We're building a whole new world
with those.  My wife is right.  It will take a long time.  We'll make a lot
more business happen&mdash;faster&mdash;by opening markets up than by closing
them down.  And we'll get a lot more done by connecting freedoms to
create with freedoms to choose and buy and use and re-use.
</p><p>
Liberating ourselves won't be easy.  But it's necessary.
