If you've read this book from Chapter 1, by this stage, you no doubt have
become comfortable with Ubuntu.  You've started to realize its advantages
and are on the way to making it your operating system of choice.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2b932f0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b><span   class="emphasis"><em>Beginning Ubuntu Linux: From Novice to

But things might still not be quite right.  For instance, you might find
the color scheme is not to your tastes.  Or perhaps you feel that the mouse
cursor moves a little too fast (or too slowly).  Maybe you simply want
to stamp your own individuality on your system to make it your very own.
</p><p>
That's what this chapter is all about.  We look at personalizing Ubuntu
so that you're completely happy with your user experience.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2b936b8"></a>
Changing the Look and Feel</h2></div></div><p>
Ubuntu is similar to Windows in many ways, but the developers behind
it introduced improvements and tweaks that many claim make the software
easier to use.  For example, Ubuntu offers multiple virtual
desktops&mdash;long
considered a very useful user-interface feature that seems to have passed
Microsoft by.  It also moves the programs menu to the top of the screen,
leaving the whole width of the screen at the bottom to display taskbar
buttons.  This is very sensible, because the buttons don't look cramped
when more than a handful of applications are open.  However, if you're not
satisfied with Ubuntu's out-of-the-box look and feel, you can change it.
</p><p>
You might be used to changing the desktop colors or wallpaper under
Windows, but Ubuntu goes to extremes and lets you alter the look and
feel of the entire desktop.  Everything from the styling of the program
windows to the desktop icons can be altered quickly and easily.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2b93818"></a>
Altering the Theme</h2></div></div><p>
Ubuntu refers to the look of the desktop as a theme.  Because it's built
on the GNOME desktop, Ubuntu allows you to radically personalize your
desktop theme.  Several different themes come with the distribution,
and you can download many more themes.  Each lets you change the way
the windows look, including the buttons and the icon set (although some
themes come without additional icons).
</p><p>
However, unlike Windows themes, most GNOME themes don't change the fonts
used on the desktop, and the wallpaper and color scheme will probably
remain broadly the same.  You can change these manually, as described in
the &ldquo;Setting Font Preferences&rdquo; and &ldquo;Changing the
Wallpaper&rdquo; sections a
bit later in this chapter.
</p><p>
To alter the theme, select System&rarr;Preferences&rarr;Theme.  Then it's simply
a matter of choosing a theme from the list in the Theme Preferences dialog
box, as shown in Figure 1.  A useful hint is to open a Nautilus file
browser window in the background (Places&rarr;Desktop), so you can see how
the changes will affect a typical window.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Note:</b></span> The default Ubuntu theme is called Human and is designed to represent
the skin tones of the world's population.  This is intended to reflect
Ubuntu's mission of being accessible to everyone, no matter where or
who they are.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9166f1.large.jpg"><img src="9166f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1.  Ubuntu comes with several theme choices.
</p></div></div><p>
My favorite themes are Clearlooks and Mist, largely because they're simple
and uncomplicated.  Remember that you'll be working with the theme on a
daily basis, so it should be practical and not too distracting.  Those
miniature close, minimize, and maximize buttons might look stylish,
but they're useless if they're so small that you can't reliably click
them with your mouse.
</p><p>
As well as changing the overall theme, you can also modify individual
theme components, and even download more theme components.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2b93d98"></a>
Changing Individual Theme Components</h2></div></div><p>
You can alter the three aspects that constitute a GNOME theme: the
controls (sometimes known as widgets), the window borders, and the
icons.  Controls are simply the elements you click within dialog boxes
and windows: buttons, scroll bars, and so on.  The window borders are,
as seems obvious, the borders of program windows and dialog boxes, with
particular attention paid to the top of the window, where the program
name appears along with the minimize, maximize, and close buttons.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Note:</b></span> To make matters a little confusing, some window borders have their
own selection of close, minimize, and maximize controls, which can't be
overridden with individual selections for controls.
</p><p>
To make changes to a theme, click the Theme Details button in the Theme
Preferences dialog box (Figure 1), and then click each tab to see your
choices, as shown in Figure 2.  Unfortunately, there are no thumbnail
previews of each style, but as soon as you click each option, it will
be automatically applied to the currently open windows.  To preview
the effects fully, the best policy is to keep a Nautilus window open
(Places&rarr;Desktop).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9166f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2.  You can create a theme by choosing your own controls, window
borders, and icons.
</p></div></div><p>
When you've made your choices, you can save the theme for further
use.  Simply click the Save Theme button in the Theme Preferences dialog
box.  You'll need to give the theme a name and, if you wish, a short
description for future reference.  If you don't save the theme, as soon
as you select another one, the changes you made will be lost.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2b941b8"></a>
Installing Additional Components</h2></div></div><p>
If you get tired of the built-in possibilities, you can download
additional theme components, such as window borders and controls, to
enhance your desktop experience.  You have two ways of getting new themes:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Download themes from the official Ubuntu repositories.
</p></li><li><p>
Visit the GNOME Art web site (<a href="http://art.gnome.org" target="_self">art.gnome.org</a>) and download items
from there.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2b944d0"></a>
Downloading from Ubuntu Repositories</h2></div></div><p>
To get theme components from the Ubuntu software repositories, you use
the Synaptic Package Manager.  Setting up Synaptic Package Manager to
use the online repositories is described in Chapter 8.
</p><p>
Select System&rarr;Administration&rarr;Synaptic Package Manager, click the
Search button, and enter <tt  >gtk2-engines</tt> as a search term (gtk2-engines is
how Ubuntu refers to theme components).  In the list of results will be
those gtk2-engines already installed, indicated by a dark green check box,
and several that are available for download.
</p><p>
Icons rarely come in gtk2-engines packages, and instead are contained
in their own packages.  To find icons, use the Synaptic Package Manager
to search for <tt  >gnome icon theme</tt> (without any dashes).
</p><p>
Although each theme component comes with a description, you won't
really know what it looks like until you see it.  The best policy is to
download all of them and audition them one by one.  However, be aware
that themes can be large, so they may take some time to download on a
slower connection.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Caution:</b></span> Unless you've already installed the KDE desktop, don't download
gtk2-engines-gtk-qt.  This is a piece of system software designed to give
KDE applications the same look as GNOME applications.  Selecting it will
cause the entire KDE desktop subsystem to download, too.
</p><p>
Don't forget that you're downloading theme components, rather than entire
themes.  To use your new theme components, select
System&rarr;Preferences&rarr;Theme, click the Theme Details button, and choose from the various lists.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2b94898"></a>
Downloading from the GNOME Art Web Site</h2></div></div><p>
Visiting the GNOME Art site (<a href="http://art.gnome.org" target="_self">art.gnome.org</a>), shown in Figure 3,
gives you access to just about every theme ever created for GNOME.  In
fact, the site also contains wallpaper selections, icons, and much more
besides.  All of the offerings are free to use, and most of the packages
are created by enthusiasts.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9166f3.large.jpg"><img src="9166f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3.  The GNOME Art site contains the latest themes, and you can
use all of them with Ubuntu.
</p></div></div><p>
Installing new theme components is easy.  If you wish to install a
new window border, for example, click the link to browse the examples
and then, when you find one you like, click to download it.  It will be
contained in a .tar.gz archive, but you don't need to unpack it.  Simply
select System&rarr;Preferences&rarr;Theme and click the Install Theme button
in the Theme Preferences dialog box.  Then browse to the downloaded theme
and click Open.  You can delete the downloaded file when you're finished.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Note:</b></span> The same principle of sharing that underlines the GPL software
license is also usually applied to themes.  This means that one person
can take a theme created by someone else, tweak it, and then release it
as a new theme.  This ensures constant innovation and improvement.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2b94cb8"></a>
Changing the Wallpaper</h2></div></div><p>
The default Ubuntu wallpaper, Lagoon, is a love-it-or-hate-it affair.  Some
find its emphasis on dark colors depressing; others appreciate its
humanist metaphor.  If you're one of those who prefer something different,
it's easy to switch.  Simply right-click the desktop and click Change
Desktop Background.  If you want to use a picture of your own as wallpaper,
click the Add Wallpaper button, and then browse to its location.
</p><p>
In the Style drop-down list, you can select from the following choices:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Centered: This option places the wallpaper in the center of the screen.  If
the wallpaper is not big enough to fill the screen, a border appears
around the edge.  If it's bigger than the screen, the edges of the
wallpaper are cropped off.
</p></li><li><p>
Fill Screen: This option forces the picture to fit the screen, including
squashing or expanding it if necessary (known as altering its aspect
ratio).  If the wallpaper isn't in the same ratio as the screen, it will
look distorted.  Most digital camera shots should be okay, because they use
the same 4:3 ratio as most monitors (although if you have a wide-screen
monitor, a digital camera picture will be stretched horizontally).
</p></li><li><p>
Scaled: Like the Fill Screen option, this option enlarges the image
if it's too small or shrinks it if it's too big, but it maintains the
aspect ratio, thus avoiding distortion.  However, if the picture is in a
different aspect ratio than the monitor, it may have borders at the edges.
</p></li><li><p>
Tiled: If the picture is smaller than the desktop resolution, this option
simply repeats the picture (starting from the top left) until the screen
is filled.  This option is primarily designed for patterned graphics.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Don't forget that the GNOME Art web site (<a href="http://art.gnome.org" target="_self">art.gnome.org</a>) offers
many wallpaper packages for download.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Tip:</b></span> Looking for some good wallpaper?
Visit Flickr (<a href="http://www.flickr.com" target="_self">www.flickr.com</a>).  This
is a community photography site where many people make their pictures
publicly available.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2f8d538"></a>
Setting Font Preferences</h2></div></div><p>
Ubuntu lets you change the fonts that are used throughout Ubuntu (referred
to as system fonts).  You can also alter how they're displayed.
</p><p>
To change a system font, select System&rarr;Preferences&rarr;Font.  In the Font
Preferences dialog box, shown in Figure 4, click the button next to
the system font you want to change, and then choose from the list.  You
can also set the font point size so, for example, you can make the labels
beneath icons easier to read.
</p><p>
By clicking the entries under the Font Rendering heading in the
Font Preferences dialog box, you can change how fonts look on
your monitor.  This will alter the antialiasing and hinting of the
font.  Antialiasing softens the edges of each letter to make them appear
less jagged.  Hinting affects the spacing and shaping of the letters.  Used
together, they can make the on-screen text look more pleasant.  Try
each Font Rendering setting in sequence to see which looks best to
you (the text in the dialog box will update automatically to show the
changes).  Nearly everyone with a TFT-based screen, including notebook
users, finds the Subpixel Smoothing option best.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9166f4.large.jpg"><img src="9166f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4.  You can alter the way fonts appear on screen by using the
Fonts Preferences dialog box.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2f8d8a8"></a>
Bytecode Hinting</h2></div></div><p>
Two font hinting subsystems are available under Ubuntu: Autohinting and
Bytecode Interpreting.  There's a lengthy debate about which produces the
best results.  Personally, I prefer to use the Bytecode Interpreter because
I believe it leads to the cleaner fonts, but others say Autohinting is
better in this regard.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the Bytecode Interpreter is protected
by patents in the United States (for more information, see
<a href="http://www.freetype.org/patents.html" target="_self">www.freetype.org/patents.html</a>).  This means that individuals in the United
States can't use it without paying a license fee to the patent holder
(in theory, at least).  Those in the rest of world should be fine.
</p><p>
It's easy to activate the Bytecode Interpreter.  Follow these steps:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Open a GNOME Terminal window (Applications&rarr;Accessories&rarr;Terminal).
</p></li><li><p>
In the terminal window, type the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
On the first screen of the configuration program, select Native to
activate the Bytecode Interpreter.  Alternatively, you can choose
Autohinting or even None, which will turn off the hinting system.
</p></li><li><p>
On the next screen, you can select whether subpixel rendering is
activated.  This is useful only for TFT screens (including notebooks),
so either select Automatic or, if you use a TFT monitor and want to ensure
the option is activated, select Always.
</p></li><li><p>
The third screen offers the option of using bitmap fonts.  These are
fonts that, unlike the TrueType fonts used within the rest of Ubuntu,
don't scale beyond their original size.  There's no harm in enabling them
because they can sometimes be useful as system fonts.
</p></li><li><p>
Once the program has finished configuring the software, restart your X
server by logging out and then back in again.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2f8df88"></a>
Configuring Input Devices</h2></div></div><p>
Mouse and key repeat speeds are personal to each user, and you may find
the default Ubuntu settings not to your taste, particularly if you have
a high-resolution mouse such as a gaming model.  Fortunately, changing
each setting is easy.  You'll find the relevant options under the
System&rarr;Preferences menu.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2f8e090"></a>
Configuring Mouse Options</h2></div></div><p>
Select System&rarr;Preferences&rarr;Mouse to open the Mouse Preferences dialog
box, which has three tabs:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Buttons: This tab lets you set whether the mouse is to be used by a
left-handed or right-handed person.  Effectively, it swaps the functions
of the right and left buttons.  Beneath this is the double-click timeout
setting.  This is ideal for people who are less physically dexterous
because the double-click speed can be slowed down.  On the other hand, if
you find yourself accidentally double-clicking items, you can speed it up.
</p></li><li><p>
Cursors: On this tab, you can select from any mouse cursor themes that
are installed.  You can also activate the Locate Pointer option, which
causes a box to appear around the mouse cursor when you press the Ctrl
key.  This can help you find the cursor on a busy desktop.
</p></li><li><p>
Motion: This tab, shown in Figure 5, lets you alter the speed of the
mouse pointer, as well as the drag-and-drop threshold.  Changes are made
as each setting is adjusted, so to test the new settings, simply move
your mouse.  Here's what the settings do:
</p></li><li><p>
The Acceleration setting controls how fast the mouse moves.  Whenever
you move the mouse, the pointer on screen moves a corresponding
amount.  However, the cursor actually increases in speed the more you move
your hand (otherwise, you would need to drag your hand across the desk
to get from one side of the screen to the other).  This is referred to
as acceleration.  If you set the acceleration too high, the pointer will
fly around the screen, seemingly unable to stop.  If you set it too slow,
you'll need to ramp the mouse several times to make it go anywhere.
</p></li><li><p>
The Sensitivity setting controls how quickly the acceleration kicks in
when you first move the mouse.  Choosing a higher setting means that you
can move the mouse relatively quickly before it starts to accelerate
and cover more screen space.  A low setting means that acceleration will
begin almost as soon as you move the mouse.  Higher sensitivity settings
give you more control over the mouse, which can be useful if you use
image-editing programs, for example.
</p></li><li><p>
The Threshold setting determines the amount of mouse movement allowed in
a click-and-drag maneuver before the item under the cursor is moved.  This
setting is designed for people who have limited dexterity and who might be
unable to keep the mouse perfectly still when clicking or double-clicking
an icon.  In such cases, a large threshold value may be preferred.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9166f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5.  The Mouse Preferences dialog box lets you tame that mouse.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2f8e7c8"></a>
Changing Keyboard Settings</h2></div></div><p>
Select System&rarr;Preferences&rarr;Keyboard to open the Keyboard Preferences
dialog box.  This dialog box has four tabs:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Keyboard: Using the Keyboard tab, you can alter the rate of key
repeat.  This can be useful if you often find yourself holding down the
Backspace key to delete a sentence; a shorter setting on the Delay slider
and a faster setting on the Speed slider can help.  However, if you get
the settings wrong, you may find double characters creeping into your
documents; typing an f may result in ff, for example.  Beneath the Repeat
Keys setting is the Cursor Blinking slider.  Altering this may help if
you sometimes lose the cursor in a document; a faster speed will mean
that the cursor spends less time being invisible between flashes.
</p></li><li><p>
Layouts: On the Layouts tab, you can choose to add an alternative
keyboard layout, as shown in Figure 6.  For example, if you write in
two different languages on your keyboard, it may be helpful to be able to
switch between them.  Click the Add button and select the second language
from the list.
</p></li><li><p>
Layout Options: This tab lets you select from a variety of handy tweaks
that affect how the keyboard works.  For example, you can configure
the Caps Lock key to act like a simple Shift key, or you can turn it
off altogether.  You can configure the Windows key so that it performs
a different function, too.  Put a check alongside the option you want
after reading through the extensive list of options.
</p></li><li><p>
Typing Break: This tab features a function that can force you to
stop typing after a predetermined number of minutes.  It does this by
blanking the screen and displaying a &ldquo;Take a break!&rdquo; message.  Note that
a notification area icon will appear before the break time to give you
advanced warning of the lockout.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9166f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6.  You can have more than one language setting in place for a
keyboard, which is handy if you need to type in a foreign language.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2f8edf8"></a>
Creating Keyboard Shortcuts</h2></div></div><p>
Ubuntu lets you define your own keyboard shortcuts for just about any
action on the system.  To create a shortcut, select
System&rarr;Preferences&rarr;Keyboard Shortcuts.  In the dialog box, search through the list for
the action you want to create a shortcut for, click it, and then press
the key (or key combination) you want to use.  For example, you might
locate the Volume Up and Volume Down entries in the list, click each,
and then press Ctrl+left arrow and Ctrl+right arrow.  Then you will be
able to turn the volume of your sound card up or down by holding down
Ctrl and tapping the left or right arrow key, respectively.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Caution:</b></span> Be careful not to assign a shortcut to a popular key.  It might
be nice to make Totem Media Player appear when you hit the spacebar, for
example, but that will mean that it will start up several times whenever
you type a sentence in a word processor! Also be aware that some key
combinations are used by applications.  Within OpenOffice.org's Writer,
for example, the Ctrl+left/right arrow key combination moves you from word
to word in a paragraph.  If you define those combinations as shortcuts,
you will no longer have this functionality.
</p><p>
I like to configure my /home folder to appear whenever I press the Home
button on the keyboard.  This can be done by locating the Home Folder
option under the Desktop heading.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2f8f008"></a>
Personalizing Login Options</h2></div></div><p>
You can even personalize the login screen under Ubuntu.  This is
known technically as the GNOME Display Manager, or GDM.  To access its
configuration options, select System&rarr;Administration&rarr;Login Screen
Setup.  The dialog box has eight tabs:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
General: In the Local drop-down list, you can choose the type of login
screen: Themed Greeter, which is to say one that includes the Ubuntu
graphic, or GTK+ Greeter, which is a basic login box into which you
can type your details.  By unchecking the Use Default Welcome boxes,
you can type your own Welcome and Remote Welcome text (the remote text
is what appears if someone logs in graphically via GDM across a network;
it isn't something you should worry about).  The Automatic Login heading
lets you do away with the login box completely and go straight to the
desktop from bootup.  Simply put a check in the box and provide the login
username.  This presents obvious security issues, but if you're the only
person using the computer and if it's located in a secure location, you
might want to choose this option.  The Timed Login option lets you select
a user who will be logged in by default after a given period.  This is
useful if you want to present the opportunity to log in as a different
user but also want to have the failsafe of logging in automatically, too.
</p></li><li><p>
GTK+ Greeter: Here, you can change the appearance of the simple GTK+
Greeter that will appear if you chose the relevant option on the General
tab.  You can change the picture by clicking the Browse button, or get rid
of it completely by clicking No Logo.  You can also alter the background
so that there's a picture or color.
</p></li><li><p>
Themed Greeter: The Themed Greeter is the default under Ubuntu, and
it makes the standard login page appear.  You can select from a couple
of other themes from the list on the left.  Particularly handy is the
Happy GNOME with Browser option, which shows a list of all users on
your system during login.  To log in, just click the appropriate entry
and type the necessary password.  Clicking the Install New Theme button
lets you install a Themed Greeter theme from disk.  You can download
these from <a href="http://art.gnome.org" target="_self">art.gnome.org</a>.
</p></li><li><p>
Security: This tab lets you alter login settings that might present a
security risk to your system.  For example, if the Happy GNOME with Browser
option is activated in the Themed Greeter tab, you can activate the Face
Browser, which will show a picture on the login screen.  This is considered
a security risk, because it removes the need for people to type in their
usernames, thus potentially handing valuable information to hackers.  You
can also activate the X Display Manager Control Protocol (XDMCP) for GDM,
which will let users log in graphically using GDM from a remote computer
(this requires the remote system to be specially configured).
</p></li><li><p>
XServer: This tab lets you specify settings that can be passed to the
X server when it's started by GDM.  In most cases, you can ignore this tab.
</p></li><li><p>
Accessibility: Here, you can allow activation of the GNOME Assistive
Technology modules.  You can also have
GDM make sounds when various events occur, such as a bad login.  This
can help partially sighted people.
</p></li><li><p>
XDMCP: If you activated XDMCP for GDM in the Security tab, this tab lets
you fine-tune various settings, such as the network port it listens
on as well as the maximum number of remote sessions.  Unless you have
specifically activated XDMCP, you can ignore this tab.
</p></li><li><p>
Users: Here, you can specify which users are offered as choices within
GDM if the Face Browser option is activated in the Security tab.  Bear in
mind that Linux has many system user accounts that aren't designed to
allow logins.  By default, all users who have a password are displayed,
which is the best way of working (the system accounts don't have passwords
because they aren't login accounts).
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2ea0050"></a>
Setting Up Assistive Technology Support</h2></div></div><p>
You might know about the Accessibility tools under Windows, which help
people with special needs use the computer.  It's possible to use an
on-screen magnifier so that users can better see what they're typing or
reading, for example.
</p><p>
Under the GNOME desktop, the Accessibility tools are referred to as
Assistive Technology Support.  To use them, you need to install additional
software packages, and then enable them.  Follow these steps:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Assuming the Synaptic Package Manager is set up to use the online
repositories (see Chapter 8), open the program
(System&rarr;Administration&rarr;Synaptic Package Manager).
</p></li><li><p>
Click the Search button and enter gok as a search term.  In the list of
results, click the check box alongside the gok entry, and then click
Mark for Installation.
</p></li><li><p>
Click the Search button again and search for gnopernicus.  Again, mark
its entry for installation.  Then click Apply.
</p></li><li><p>
Once the packages are installed, select
System&rarr;Administration&rarr;Preferences&rarr;Assistive Technology Support.  Click the check box alongside
Enable Assistive Technologies.
</p></li><li><p>
Choose from the list the features you would like to use.  They will then
start automatically the next time you log in.  The options work as follows:
</p></li></ol></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The Screenreader uses a speech synthesizer to announce whatever you
click on, as well as whatever you type.  To alter its settings, click
the Preferences button in the Gnopernicus dialog box, and then click
the Speech button in the Preferences dialog box.
</p></li><li><p>
The GNOME Onscreen Keyboard (GOK) can be used by a mouse, but is
most useful when an alternative input device is used, such as a touch
screen.  As well as presenting a virtual keyboard, it shows the options
on screen as a large and easy-to-activate series of buttons.  For more
information, click the Help button when GOK starts.
</p></li><li><p>
The Magnifier divides the screen into two halves.  The right side displays
a magnified version of the left side.  To learn more, click the Help
button in the Gnopernicus dialog box.
</p></li><li><p>
Gnopernicus also includes support for Braille output devices.  To learn
more, click the Help button.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2ea0890"></a>
Changing Your Login Picture</h2></div></div><p>
If you activate the Face Browser feature along with the Happy GNOME
with Browser option, GDM will display a picture alongside your username
on the login screen, as shown in Figure 7.  You can then click this
and type your password to log in.  You might be familiar with a similar
system under Windows XP.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9166f7.large.jpg"><img src="9166f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7.  The Face Browser lets each user choose an icon to appear on
the login screen.
</p></div></div><p>
You can choose your login picture by clicking
System&rarr;Preferences&rarr;Login Photo.  Ubuntu offers several pictures to choose from, or you can
click the Browse button to locate your own.  Ideally, the image you choose
should be square and 96&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;6 pixels, although if the picture is too large,
it will be automatically scaled down.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2ea0ba8"></a>
Adding and Removing Desktop Items</h2></div></div><p>
Virtually the entire Ubuntu desktop can be redesigned and
restructured.  You can move the Applications menu from the top of the
screen to the bottom to be more like Windows, for example, or you can
add numerous desktop shortcuts to popular applications and/or files.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2ea0cb0"></a>
Adding a Shortcut</h2></div></div><p>
Ubuntu's nearest equivalent to a Windows-style desktop shortcut is
a launcher.  An important difference, however, is that launchers are
designed to run a certain command.  Therefore, they can only point at
programs (although you could create a launcher that contained a command
chain required to run a particular program and file; to use The GIMP to
open a picture, you might create a launcher that ran <tt  >gimp
picture.jpg</tt>,
for example).
</p><p>
If you want to make a shortcut to a data file, such as a picture, you
need to create a link.  This is just as easy as creating a launcher.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2ea0e68"></a>
Creating a Launcher</h2></div></div><p>
You can create a launcher two ways.  One way is to simply click and drag an
icon from one of the main menus to the desktop.  This effectively copies
the menu's launcher to the desktop, rather than creating a new launcher,
but the effect is the same.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Note:</b></span> Not all menu items can be dragged and dropped to create launchers.  In
particular, most items on the System menu cannot be dragged and dropped.
</p><p>
The other way to create a launcher is to right-click the desktop and
select Create Launcher.  In the Create Launcher dialog box, you need
to fill in only the Name and Command field; the others fields can be
left blank.  The Command field must contain a Linux executable program,
command, or script.  If you use a command-line program or script, you must
check the Run in Terminal box.  This will open a GNOME Terminal window
automatically and run the command or script within it.  The terminal
window will disappear as soon as the command has finished.
</p><p>
To choose an icon for your launcher, click the Icon button in the Create
Launcher dialog box.  If you don't choose an icon, the stock GNOME one is
used (the same icon as is used for unidentified and/or system files).  You
can select from several predefined icons or choose your own picture by
clicking the Browse button, as shown in Figure 8.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9166f8.large.jpg"><img src="9166f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8.  Creating a launcher is easy.  Just fill in the Name and Command
fields, and choose an icon.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2ea1288"></a>
Creating a Link</h2></div></div><p>
Although you can create a link to a program, which will then work the same
as a launcher, links are usually used to create shortcuts to files.  If
you then double-click the shortcut, the application associated with that
file type will open the file.  If you create a shortcut to a picture, for
example, when you double-click it, the Eye of GNOME previewer will start.
</p><p>
To create a link, locate the file you want to create the link to,
right-click it, and select Make Link.  Then copy the new link to wherever
you want it to appear, such as the desktop.  You don't need to choose
an icon, because the link inherits the icon of the original file.  For
example, if it's a picture link, it will inherit the thumbnail preview
icon.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Note:</b></span> If you find the Make Link option grayed out, it's likely that you
don't have sufficient permissions to write the link to the directory
in question.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2ea1498"></a>
Adding and Removing Menus</h2></div></div><p>
You can add either the Applications menu or the entire set of menus
(Applications, Places, and System) to the bottom of the screen.  This
can help those who long for the Windows Start button approach to access
programs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2ea15a0"></a>
Adding All the Menus to a Panel</h2></div></div><p>
To add the Application, Places, and System menu to the Panel at the
bottom of the Ubuntu desktop, follow these steps:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Right-click a blank spot on the bottom Panel and select Add to Panel.
</p></li><li><p>
In the dialog box that appears, click the Menu Bar option to add all
three menus.
</p></li><li><p>
Click the Add button at the bottom of the dialog box.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2ea1910"></a>
Adding the Applications Menu to a Panel</h2></div></div><p>
When you add just the Applications menu, it appears as a single icon.  To
move it to the bottom-left side of the desktop, in the same location
as the Windows Start menu, you need to delete and then re-create the
Show Desktop icon and the Window List.  Here are the steps:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Right-click a blank spot on the bottom Panel and select Add to Panel.
</p></li><li><p>
In the dialog box that appears, click the Main Menu option.
</p></li><li><p>
Click the Add button at the bottom of the dialog box.
</p></li><li><p>
Right-click the Window List's grab bar and select Delete.
</p></li><li><p>
Right-click the Show Desktop icon and select Delete.
</p></li><li><p>
Right-click the new menu icon, select Move, and relocate it to the
bottom left.
</p></li><li><p>
Right-click the Panel and select Add to Panel.
</p></li><li><p>
In the Desktop &amp; Windows category, select Window List, and then click Add.
</p></li><li><p>
Repeat steps 7&ndash;8 to add the Show Desktop button.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
When you're finished, the Applications menu should appear as shown in
Figure 9.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9166f9.large.jpg"><img src="9166f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9.  If you just can't do without that Start button, you can
re-create one on your Ubuntu desktop.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x311df90"></a>
Deleting a Menu</h2></div></div><p>
Creating new instances of the menus won't delete the old ones.  If you
create a new Applications menu at the bottom of the screen, for example,
the old Applications menu will remain at the top of the screen.  In fact,
you can have as many instances of the menus on the desktop as you wish,
although this won't be a good use of desktop space!
</p><p>
To delete any menu, simply right-click anywhere on that menu and select
Remove from Panel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x311e0f0"></a>
Give Me My Trash Can!</h2></div></div><p>
The developers who designed Ubuntu's desktop decided to keep the desktop
clean of icons.  This included relegating the Wastebasket icon to its own
applet at the bottom-right side of the screen.  Many people find using
the applet a little difficult and miss the desktop trash can icon, which
has been present on Windows and Mac OS desktops for more than 20 years.
</p><p>
The good news is that it's easy to get the trash can back.  Click
Applications&rarr;System Tools&rarr;Configuration Editor.  In the program
window that appears, click the down arrows next to Apps, then Nautilus,
and then Desktop.  On the right side of the program window, put a check
in the trash_icon_visible entry.
</p><p>
Alternatively, in the Configuration Editor, click Edit&rarr;Find
and enter trash_icon_visible as a search term.  Make sure that the
Search Also In Key Names box has a check in it.  Then click Find.  The
results will be listed at the bottom of the program window.  Click the
/apps/nautilus/desktop/trash_icon_visible entry.  Then make sure there's
a check in the trash_icon_visible box.
</p><p>
Be careful when using the Configuration Editor program.  It lets you
configure just about every aspect of the GNOME desktop and doesn't warn
you when you're about to do something devastating, so the potential for
accidental damage is high!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x311e300"></a>
Personalizing the Panels</h2></div></div><p>
Panels are the long strips that appear at the top and bottom of the
Ubuntu screen and play host to a choice of applets and/or icons.  You can
add a new panel by simply right-clicking an existing one and selecting
New Panel, or you can remove a panel by right-clicking it and selecting
Delete This Panel.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Caution:</b></span> If you delete a panel, the arrangement of applets it contains
will be lost.  Of course, you can always re-create the collection of
applets on a different panel.
</p><p>
By right-clicking a panel and selecting Properties, you can change its
size and dimensions.  For example, by unchecking the Expand box, you
can make the panel shrink to its smallest possible size.  Then, when you
add new applets (or, in the case of a panel containing the Window List,
a new program is run), the panel will expand as necessary.  This can be
a neat effect and also creates more desktop space.
</p><p>
Selecting the Autohide feature will make the panel slide off the screen
when there isn't a mouse over it.  Choosing Show Hide Buttons will make
small arrows appear on either side of the panel so that you can click
to slide it off the side of the screen when it's not in use.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x311e568"></a>
Working with Applets</h2></div></div><p>
Almost everything you see on the desktop is an applet, with the exception
of shortcut icons and the panels.  A menu is a form of applet, for example,
as is the Workspace Switcher.
</p><p>
Ubuntu provides many more applets that you can choose to add to the
desktop to provide a host of useful or entertaining functionality.  To
add an applet, right-click the Panel and select Add to Panel.  As
shown in Figure 10, you have a wide choice of applets, divided into
categories.  Many require configuration when they've been created, so you
may need to right-click them and select Properties.  For example, you'll
need to set your location in the Weather Report applet's properties so
it can provide accurate forecasting.
</p><p>
To remove an applet, simply right-click it and select Remove from Panel.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9166f10.large.jpg"><img src="9166f10.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10.  A wide variety of applets are available.  Some are informative;
others are just fun.

Setting Power-Saving Features</h2></div></div><p>
Ubuntu includes a number of features to use the power-saving features of
your computer, including the ability to switch off the monitor after a
set period of inactivity.  However, some quick configuration is necessary
to set up the system just the way you want it.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Tip:</b></span> If your computer has a CPU that can adjust its clock speed on the fly,
such as a mobile processor or an AMD chip with the PowerNow! function,
Ubuntu will automatically install software that will make this work.  To
see the speed of your processor, right-click the Panel, select Add to
Panel, and choose the CPU Frequency Scaling Monitor.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x311ea90"></a>
Controlling the Monitor Shutoff</h2></div></div><p>
You can configure the monitor to go into standby mode after a certain
amount of time has passed.  This can save a lot of electricity should
you happen to leave your computer unattended for long periods.
</p><p>
To configure this aspect of Ubuntu, select System&rarr;Preferences&rarr;Screensaver, and click the Advanced tab, as shown in Figure 11.  In
the Display Power Management section, make sure the Power Management
box is checked.  Set the desired timings in the Standby, Suspend, and Off
boxes.  Not all monitors support all three features.  Consult your monitor's
manual to determine which you should configure.  If you're unable to find
this information, simply set all three to similar values.  For example,
set Standby to 30 minutes, Suspend to 31, and Off to 32.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9166f11.large.jpg"><img src="9166f11.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Spinning Down the Hard Disk</h2></div></div><p>
All modern hard disks come with the ability to spin down their motors to
save energy.  Then, when data is requested, the motors spin up again.  There
may be a slight delay while this happens, and some people dislike using
disk spin-down because of this.  However, on a notebook, it can lead to
a substantial increase in battery life.  On a desktop system, it's worth
considering, because over the lifetime of a computer, it can save a lot
of electricity (and therefore money!).
</p><p>
The spin-down settings are contained in the /etc/hdparm.conf file,
which you'll need to edit by hand.  Follow these steps to adjust the
spin-down settings:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Open a GNOME Terminal window (Applications&rarr;Accessories&rarr;Terminal).
</p></li><li><p>
Type the following in the terminal window:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo gedit /etc/hdparm.conf
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
Click Search&rarr;Find and, in the box, type
<tt  >spindown_time</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
Click the Find button, and then close the Search dialog box.
</p></li><li><p>
Change the line the Find routine has highlighted to remove the hash mark
from the beginning, so it reads like this: <tt  >spindown_time =
24</tt>.  You can alter the value to anything you want.  Each time
unit is five seconds, so 24 equates to 120 seconds (24x5 seconds), or
2 minutes.  To set a time of 20 minutes, enter 240 (240x5 seconds).  If
you specify a number above 240, the time units are increased to 30
minutes.  In other words, a value of 241 will equate to 30 minutes,
a value of 242 will equate to 60 minutes, and so on.
</p></li><li><p>
When you've finished, save the file.
</p></li><li><p>
Reboot for the settings to take effect.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x311f538"></a>
Power Saving&mdash;Is It Worth It?</h2></div></div><p>
An average computer draws anywhere between 100 to 500 watts of power.  An
average light bulb draws around 150 watts of power, so you can see that,
relatively speaking, computers are low power consumers compared to many
household devices.  However, it's still worth considering employing
power-saving techniques.  You might not save yourself a lot of money,
but if you switch on power saving, and your neighbor does too, and her
neighbor does, then the cumulative effect will add up, and we can all
contribute less towards global warming.
</p><p>
Try to avoid leaving your computer turned on overnight, or when you're
away from it for long periods.  As well as saving power, switching off
your computer will avoid wear and tear on its components.  Although
the CPU can work 24/7 without trouble, it's cooled by a fan that's a
simple mechanical device.  There are other fans in your computer too,
such as the graphics card fan and case fan.  Each of these will eventually
wear out.  If your graphics card fan stops working, the card itself will
overheat and might burn out.  The same is true of the CPU fan.  However,
by shutting down your computer overnight, you can effectively double
the life of the fans and radically reduce the risk of catastrophic
failure.  Isn't that worth considering?

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
In this chapter, you've learned how to completely personalize Ubuntu to
your own tastes.  We've looked at changing the theme so that the desktop
has a new appearance, and we've examined how to make the input devices
behave exactly as you would like.
</p><p>
In addition, you've learned how to add and remove applets from the
desktop in order to add functionality or simply make Ubuntu work the
way you would like.
</p><p>
Finally, we looked at the power-saving functions under Ubuntu and how
you can avoid your computer wasting energy.
</p><p>
In the next chapter, we will look at what programs are available under
Ubuntu to replace those Windows favorites you might miss.
