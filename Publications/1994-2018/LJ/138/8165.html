Need to equip an office with terminals and phones, all on a small budget?
With LTSP and KPhone, you can do it with only terminals, sound cards
and headsets.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d2580.0x26ca240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
A new customer approached us with a need to provision
the office. The customer was receptive to open-source
software and was interested in using Linux. Being a
nonprofit organization, the budget for the project
was tight.
</p><p>
We provisioned the new office with a server running
software from the Linux Terminal Server Project
(LTSP) to make the desktop economical from the
start. We then installed an Asterisk server as a PBX
for the call center. To make things easier for the
staff, we wanted to have a working soft phone on their
terminals with headsets for hands-free operation.
</p><p>
This article discusses the installation and use of the
LTSP build environment to build Qt and KPhone so
the staff members could run KPhone locally on their terminals.
I do not discuss the installation of Linux or Asterisk
here, but I have included the relevant context
for KPhone, which resides in the Asterisk sip.conf file.
We used Gentoo for this particular LTSP server, but any Linux
distribution can do the job.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d2580.0x26ca3f8"></a>
Software Needed</h2></div></div><p>
The main software packages needed for this project
were LTSP, KPhone and the LTSP build environment
(LBE). LTSP easily provides thin-client access to a main
server. We often recommend LTSP as an economical
way to equip an office, because it focuses monetary
resources on the main server rather than on the
individual stations. The incremental cost of adding
a new user to the office is relatively small, and
administration is simplified.
</p><p>
The customer's new office is intended to be a small call center,
so hands-free phone operation is a big benefit. We wanted to try
using headsets and amplifiers that use a computer sound card for their
connectivity rather than hardware phones. These headsets, coupled with
software SIP phones on each user's local station, allowed us to meet their
phone needs without having to buy separate phone equipment.
</p><p>
Because we already were using Asterisk (see the on-line Resources) as the PBX for
the office, it seemed logical to use an open-source software phone.
We decided to use KPhone (see Resources) as the software SIP phone, because
it had proven reliable on standalone systems previously tested.
One of the drawbacks of every SIP soft-phone package we investigated at
the time was none supported a network-enabled sound protocol. As a
result, they were required to run locally on the station that physically has the
sound card. As these stations are thin clients that boot from the
main server, KPhone needs to be resident in the filesystem on each
station. When a user runs KPhone from the desktop, which runs on the
server, the KPhone process needs to start in the local terminal
environment. </p><p>
KPhone is not a standard part of the LTSP package, so
we needed to build it inside the local stations'
root filesystem that is NFS-mounted from the server
at boot time. Building software for the terminals'
root filesystem requires LBE (see Resources).
Building software in LBE also requires that all
necessary libraries be present in the filesystem.
One of the other benefits of KPhone is the Qt library is the only
library required beyond those already in LTSP.
</p><p>
Installation and
configuration of LTSP are detailed in the LTSP documentation (see
Resources). One deviation from the standard install of LTSP is
that the DHCP configuration file must reference the root filesystem
that LBE builds rather than the root filesystem installed with the
LTSP package (Listing 1).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d2580.0x26ca660"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. Our LTSP Section of dhcpd.conf
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
# LTSP Path Options

  "192.168.42.254:/usr/local/src/lbe/opt/ltsp/i386";

#LTSP boot image (relative to the TFTP root)
filename
  "/pxe2/pxelinux.0";
</pre></div><p>
Technically, we did not need the LTSP package because LBE includes
the necessary boot image and root filesystem. However, if you are not
already familiar with LTSP, I recommend you install that package first
and get it operational. Deploying LTSP involves the configuration of other
standard software included with almost all Linux distributions: DHCP for
assigning IP addresses, boot images and root filesystem information for
the stations; TFTP for client stations to retrieve their boot images;
and NFS for thin clients to remote-mount their root filesystems and
the /home filesystem for running remote applications. Installing LTSP
provides demo configurations for all of these packages that makes setup
much easier for a novice.
</p><p>
The main LTSP documentation describes well most of the preparation for
running applications locally on the clients. Their installation and
configuration also are covered on the LTSP 4.1 Web page. In addition to
the software mentioned above, you also need to configure SSH client and
NIS on the server.
</p><p>
SSH is the means we used for starting the process on the remote client.
Notice that the LTSP 4.1 documentation demonstrates the use of rsh for
launching the applications. Although that would work, the required d&aelig;mons for
rsh no longer are part of the LTSP package. SSH is now the norm for launching
local applications. You can find information about preparing for SSH launching of local
applications in the Local Applications section of the LBE documentation.
</p><p>
NIS is needed because the thin clients need to authenticate users
through SSH as they launch the applications. NIS configuration
is guided by the NIS HOWTO. One item that was not immediately
obvious from the documentation was that NIS would complain that
/etc/publickey was not present. Creating that file with <tt  >touch
/etc/publickey</tt> solved the problem.
</p><p>
Once all the supporting software is in place, configuring LTSP to run local
applications is easy: set <tt  >LOCAL_APPS = Y</tt> in
/etc/lts.conf within the LTSP root filesystem. This
causes the clients to mount the /home directory from
the server with NFS. Also, NIS is made active by /var/yp/nicknames,
/etc/yp/conf being created on the clients,
domainname being run with the value of the NIS_DOMAIN
entry in the lts.conf file and ypbind being run. The
sshd d&aelig;mon also is activated on the client.
</p><p>
For SSH operations to be transparent to users, we need SSH keys created
without expecting users to do it themselves. To accomplish that, we installed
superadduser in Gentoo, which is reported to be
adduser from Slackware (see Resources) and modified it to generate the
SSH keys automatically for the user when the user is created
(Listing 2).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d2580.0x26caad8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

#
# update the NIS stuff
(cd /var/yp; make &gt; /dev/null)
</pre></div><p>
Aside from configuring local applications to run on the client terminals, we
also need to make sure the sound cards are active when the thin clients boot.
Normally, one would set <tt  >SOUND = Y</tt>,
<tt  >SOUND_DAEMON = &lt;nasd or esd&gt;</tt>,
<tt  >VOLUME = &lt;default volume level&gt;</tt> and possibly
<tt  >SMODULE_01 = &lt;ISA configuration string&gt;</tt>. However, doing so not only causes
the sound driver to be loaded into the kernel, but it starts the sound d&aelig;mon,
which we do not want. We need the sound card to be
available for KPhone when it starts on the terminal.
</p><p>
What we do instead is set <tt  >SOUND = N</tt> to keep the normal sound
system from being activated and <tt  >MODULE_01 = &lt;kernel module for the
PCI soundcard&gt;</tt>, because LTSP does not have isapnp support, so audio needs a
PCI audio device. We also set <tt  >RCFILE_10 = "kphone"</tt> to run the initial configuration script
to ready the system for KPhone by using the audio device. Then, in
/etc/rc.d in the clients' root filesystem, we put the
KPhone script (Listing 3) to enable access to the
/dev/sound/* files. -rwrwrw access is not the most
secure, but because only one user is running processes on the terminal at
a time, it works fine. Finally, we turn on the microphone and adjust the gain and
volume levels.

Building Qt and KPhone</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have the LTSP environment configured and operational, you can
build the LBE. Getting LBE from CVS is as simple as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.ltsp.org:/usr/local/cvsroot checkout -s
</pre>
</p><p>
You then need to <tt  >su</tt> to root&mdash;using
<tt  >sudo</tt> with the LBE doesn't reliably work&mdash;and run
<tt  >./build_all</tt>. You can take a break here, as the build
of LTSP in LBE takes some time to complete.
</p><p>
Once you have the new root filesystem for the terminals built, change your DHCP
configuration to refer to that boot image and root filesystem, and restart your
DHCP server. You probably want to move /etc/lts.conf from your old LTSP root filesystem to
the new one. You also should move the system-wide SSH known-host
keys&mdash;the ones you created as per the Local Applications section of
the LBE document&mdash;to the new filesystem.
</p><p>
Now we need to build the Qt libraries and then KPhone inside the clients' root
filesystem. The LTSP Build Environment (LBE) makes this much more manageable.
Adding packages for building in the environment amounts to creating a
package.def file in a directory named for the package. The package.def files
describe how to get, verify the download, unpack, configure, build and
install the package software. The build script in the ltsp-src directory then
does a chroot and executes the build process.
</p><p>
Through trial and error and
discussions on the LTSP IRC channel (see Resources), we were able to construct
the required package.def files (see Resources for those files).
Constructing the package.def file for building Qt, in
ltsp-src/qt under the LBE root,
was a straightforward process. Each build exported the same variables
to the build environment. Notice, also, that threading is turned on explicitly
at the CONFIGURE stage. KPhone builds much more easily if Qt has threading enabled,
but it is not enabled by default in Qt.
</p><p>
Building KPhone was a bit more complicated. The package.def file (see
Resources) works well enough, but the x-includes configuration option does
not seem to change the resulting Makefiles. This would cause compilation
errors when building trayicon.cpp. Manually adding
<tt  >-I/usr/X11R6/include</tt> to
CFLAGS in kphone/kphone/kphone/Makefile (Listing 4)
after the configuration stage seemed to fix the problem, however. The
steps to build KPhone in LBE are then:

<pre     class="programlisting">

ltsp-src# ./build --configure --only=kphone
ltsp-src# vi kphone/kphone/kphone/Makefile
   (Add "-I/usr/X11R6/include" to CFLAGS)
ltsp-src# ./build --only=kphone

</pre>
</p><p>
We also noticed that the icons were not being located properly by KPhone at
first. Making a link to ../../share/kphone in opt/ltsp/i386/usr/share from
the LBE root&mdash;/usr/share from the clients' root&mdash;allowed KPhone
to find the icons correctly.

</pre></div><p>
To run KPhone, we put a script in /usr/bin on the
terminal server called kphone (Listing 5). This script simply opens
access to the xserver, determines the terminal at which the user
is sitting and starts the KPhone process on that terminal.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d2580.0x26cb898"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

HOST=`echo $DISPLAY | awk -F: '{ print $1 }'`
export HOST
ssh ${HOST} env DISPLAY=:0.0 /bin/kphone
</pre></div><p>
To make things easier for the users, we created an entry in the KMenu for
KPhone that they can select or move onto their docks if they wish. This entry
is created by adding the file kphone.desktop
(Listing 6) to /usr/kde/3.3/share/applications/kde on
the terminal server.

The user then can select the KPhone menu item and launch KPhone (Figure
1). The first time the application is run, the user has to
select File&rarr;Identity to open the Identity dialog (Figure 2) and enter the connection
information. The data to enter here must match that information for the SIP accounts
on the VoIP server (Asterisk in our case). Because KPhone stores its
configuration in the user's home directory, it need be configured only
the first time the user starts KPhone. Because /home is NFS-mounted from the
server, the station where users log in is their phone, so the phone
effectively follows them if they should change workstations.
Once users have registered with the server, they can make calls from the
call dialog and DTMF panel (Figure 3).

</p></div></div><p>
Initially we had KPhone running, but the response time for any action was
horrible. Any time the user would perform an action
that caused an SIP message to be sent&mdash;dial a number, press a phone
button on an active call, answer or hang up the phone&mdash;it would take nearly a
minute for the action to occur.
</p><p>
We determined that this problem was occurring because of a DNS name resolution issue that was
waiting to timeout. The solution was to put entries into
/etc/hosts for each of the stations that would
be running KPhone, install dnsmasq on the terminal server and have the
terminals reference the terminal server as their DNS server, configured in
dhcp.conf. There are other, perhaps better, ways to solve this issue, but this
solution took minimal time to configure and run, and it worked. Finding the source
of the problem was the hard part.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d2580.0x2ac44e0"></a>
Gotchas</h2></div></div><p>
There have been a couple drawbacks to this system. Occasionally KPhone
closes for no given reason, which can be quite annoying. We have not yet
determined the cause of this problem, and we hoped that upgrading KPhone to
4.1 might help.
</p><p>
The KPhone package.def file contains the necessary lines for building
KPhone 4.1.1. The change to the Makefile mentioned above for 4.0.5
still applies as of 4.1.1. Our preliminary tests indicate, however, that
4.1.1 has the same problem of closing suddenly for an unknown reason. We have
inquired with the maintainers of KPhone to see if they can help, but so far we
do not know the cause of the problem.
</p><p>
Another drawback is that when the phone rings, it rings through the headset
and gives a visual alert on the screen. If users are not in front of
their terminals with their headsets on, they will not know that their phones
are ringing. Once the call center is in full operation, operators
probably will spend most of their time at the terminals, so this may not be
a problem.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d2580.0x2ac4698"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
We now have KPhone installed and able to be run from any terminal attached to
the LTSP server. Adding another user is as simple as creating an account for
them on the server, adding a SIP phone entry for them on the phone system
and having them configure KPhone. The terminal server is the single point of
maintenance for everyone's desktops. Even though KPhone runs locally on each
terminal, the LTSP build environment is the single point of maintenance
for all of them.
</p><p>
The cost for the system is concentrated in the terminal server and phone
system. The incremental cost for each new user is the cost of a low-end
terminal and a sound card headset. This expense is much more cost
effective than putting a full workstation at each desktop along with a
headset-capable hard phone.
