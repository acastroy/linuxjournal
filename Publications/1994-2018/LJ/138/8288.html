This Linux Dad got the young members of his family set up with
educational software, art tools and games.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd1580.0x1ec9298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
When pressed to answer truthfully, most parents agree that raising
kids is a big experiment. In the December 2004 issue of
<i  >LJ</i>, Diego Betancor's
letter motivated me to experiment with something I've
been meaning to do for some time. Diego wanted to see more content in
<i  >LJ</i> aimed at kids, and his suggestion was the inspiration for the next
phase of my child-rearing experiment: moving the kids to Linux.
</p><p>
My wife Deirdre and I have three young children: Joseph, age nine; Aaron,
age seven; and and Aideen, age five&mdash;see Figure 1. As shown in the photo, indoctrination
starts early in the Barry household: there's a fluffy Tux in the
foreground and an electronic Tux on the screen.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8288f1.large.jpg"><img src="8288f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
With his dad being a longtime computer geek, it came as no
surprise when Joseph took to the computer at a
young age. For years, our home computer was a first-generation
iMac, running Mac OS. A great 3-D shoot'em-up game came with the iMac,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Nanosaur</em></span>, that Joseph just loves. Despite this,
our household software policy always has been to try
to ensure that any software brought into the house
is classified as educational. Therefore, Joseph also has a bunch
of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Land Before Time</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Zoombini</em></span> titles,
as well as kiddie-strategy games, such as <span   class="emphasis"><em>Darby
the Dragon</em></span>. Other software includes the usual
encyclopedia, dinosaur and space-exploration titles.
</p><p>
Aaron is the sporty child in the house as well as the artist, and he
has been happy to sit and play with the paint application
integrated into ClarisWorks, the simple office suite that came with the
iMac. Aaron also likes to play with Joseph's software, as well as some
of Aideen's titles, which include <span   class="emphasis"><em>Green Eggs and
Ham</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sammy's
Science House</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Thinking Things</em></span>.
</p><p>
As long as there's a lot of bright colors and funny sound effects,
Aideen's happy, even though this five-year-old's attention span is not
at all lengthy.
</p><p>
As great as it is, the iMac had been showing its age
for some time. It also has become increasingly difficult
to find original software titles for its effectively
discontinued OS version. Trying to upgrade to Mac OS
X or any modern version of Linux was not an option
for the iMac; it's simply too underpowered. Without new
titles, the kids were getting bored with the iMac
and had been asking for a new computer. They also
constantly bugged both me and their Mum to install
various Windows titles on our laptops&mdash;especially
the demo software that comes free inside various
cereal packets. As Deirdre has to run Windows 2000
for work, her laptop was the one infected with a
growing collection of these types of titles.
</p><p>
A few months back, a new computer arrived in the form of a Dell Optiplex
GX270, with 512MB of RAM, a 40GB hard disk and a flat-panel monitor. As I'd
rather eat the new PC than allow the kids to use the factory-installed
Windows XP, I looked for a family-friendly Linux distribution to install
instead. Having recently experimented with Ubuntu Linux as my office
desktop, I downloaded and burned a copy of the Warty Warthog release
for use at home.
</p><p>
Like most big kids, I love experiments, and now my experiment had a
plan: replace the Dell's factory-installed OS with Ubuntu, pack it full of
kid-friendly software, let the kids at it and see how they got on.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd1580.0x1ec9b30"></a>
Going Cold Turkey</h2></div></div><p>
I deliberately decided against installing any type of emulation that would
have allowed the kids to run any of their existing software titles, even
though such technology is well established within the Linux community. My
main reason for doing this was to see if the kids would identify
any titles that they missed. If they did, I'd try to find native alternatives,
install them and see if the yearning subsided.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd1580.0x1ec9c38"></a>
Installing and Configuring Ubuntu</h2></div></div><p>
Ubuntu installed easily on the Dell, taking about one hour from
start to finish. Once the base OS was up and running, I installed a bunch
of stuff for the kids to use. I created a user ID called kids with a
password of dinosaur and then set up a window in Nautilus to mimic the
look and feel of the Mac OS Launcher program, as shown in Figure 1.
Nautilus hopefully would provide a familiar
look and feel for my pint-sized,
Mac-loving user community.

Software for the Kids</h2></div></div><p>
In an attempt to ease the introduction of a new&mdash;and somewhat
different&mdash;computer into the house, we decided to relax our household software
policy and install a few nice Linux games along with the
educational software. Here's a quick rundown of the titles we decided
to make available on the desktop launcher. Unless stated otherwise,
these titles were downloaded into Ubuntu using the included Synaptic
Package Manager. It helps to refer to Figure 1 while working through
this list.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>AisleRiot Solitaire</em></span> (/usr/games/sol) is a Linux version of the classic
solitaire game. It came pre-installed on Ubuntu and was elevated to
the Launcher in an attempt to provide a familiar piece of software on
the new desktop.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Bug Squish</em></span> (/usr/games/bugsquish) is a bit mindless but fun all the
same. Little bugs drop down and try to land on an arm. Your
mission&mdash;should you accept it&mdash;is to squish as many bugs as you can by clicking
your mouse on them. As I said, it's mindless, but it does allow little
people to practice their mouse skills while having some fun.
</p></li><li><p>
Calculator (/usr/bin/gcalctool) is the GNOME calculator.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Four-in-a-Row/Connect 4</em></span> (/usr/games/gnect) is just like the board
game. You can play against another human opponent or an increasingly
more skillful computer user.
</p></li><li><p>
G Compris (/usr/games/gcompris) has to be the real
find of the experiment. This is a single program
that has many, many parts. It is an entire suite of
educational tools packaged together and aimed at 3&ndash;8
year olds. Within the suite are&mdash;among many other
things&mdash;word and number games, color-matching and
memory exercises and geography quizzes. There's
loads of educational functionality in G Compris,
and it is graduated, which means the child
cannot proceed to a later exercise until they have
mastered the earlier ones.
G Compris can be installed
in one of a number of languages and has a friendly
soundtrack and voice-over. I initially thought
Aaron and Aideen would spend a lot of time in this
program and was surprised to find Joseph enjoying
it too. There's so much in G Compris that it really
needs to be experienced to be believed.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>K Tuberling, The Potato Guy</em></span> (/usr/games/ktuberling) is a simple little
program that provides a blank picture upon which you can place, for
example, ears, eyes, noses, spectacles, hats and hair. The default
blank picture is a potato, but a blank Tux also is provided. Aideen
loves this program, as do the boys. The boys love it so much that they
used <span   class="emphasis"><em>K Tuberling</em></span> to create a gallery of Tux and his family. Check out
Tux's mother-in-law, as shown in Figure 3.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>MathWar</em></span> (/usr/bin/mathwar) is a simple X-based math-drill program.
</p></li><li><p>
Office Draw (/usr/bin/oodraw) and Office Writer (/usr/bin/oowriter),
both part of the OpenOffice.org suite, were included primarily for
Aaron, who likes to draw with the computer as well as write short
stories and poems. I'd recently convinced the kids' school teacher to
try OpenOffice.org for Windows in their school, in an effort to fix file
format compatibility problems she was having with the school's existing
choice of office suite. So, making OpenOffice.org available on the kids'
PC made perfect sense.
</p></li><li><p>
Play a DVD (/usr/bin/xine) allows the kids to view any of the DVDs that
they own. To get DVD playing to work on Ubuntu, I had to search Goggle
for the libdvdcss library, which allows for the DVD movie encoding
to be deciphered. Once the library was installed, DVD viewing worked.
Xine was a big hit, not only because it supports DVD menus
and the like but also because it allows viewers to capture snapshots
of the currently playing movie. Once he discovered this Xine feature,
Joseph wasted no time and created a gallery of snapshots of his current DVD
favorite, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Incredibles</em></span>. An added bonus to being able to view
DVDs on the new computer is that the main household TV and DVD player
are freed-up for Mum and Dad to use. Xine was chosen over the
Ubuntu-installed Totem, which did not work as well as Xine in any of my tests.
</p></li><li><p>
Play a Music CD (/usr/bin/gnome-cd) turns the PC into a CD player, with
the default GNOME CD player popping up whenever an audio CD is popped
into the CD drive.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Super Tux</em></span> (/usr/games/supertux) is a classic,
Mario-style, jump-and-bump-level game that should be familiar to many readers. Saying that
the boys love this game would be a complete understatement: they
are totally besotted with it. A little animated Penguin jumps and
bumps his way through increasingly difficult levels in search of his
goal. The soundtrack to this game is great, as are the effects and
configurability. If anything, it's a little too addictive and, of all
the programs described in this article, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Super Tux</em></span> is the program most
likely to be on-screen when I enter the playroom. This has caused Deirdre
to worry that the boys are playing it <span   class="emphasis"><em>too much</em></span>. However, as the
game allows players to design and use their own levels, and as the boys
have started to do just that, I've been happy to let <span   class="emphasis"><em>Super
Tux</em></span> survive. I figure that building a level is the first tentative step
toward getting the computer to work the way the kids want it to, which
isn't a huge leap away from that other popular customization technique:
programming. So, highly addictive or not, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Super Tux</em></span>
stays for now&mdash;unless the boys are cheeky to their Mum, in which case
it'll be wiped from the PC faster than they can say &ldquo;yahtzee!&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tali - Yahtzee</em></span> (/usr/games/gtali) is a nice implementation of the classic
dice game. The iMac had a great version of this game that the boys
always liked to play, and the GNOME version is similar and familiar.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tux Kart</em></span> (/usr/games/tuxkart) is an arcade-type racer game. Little
Tux sits in a go-kart and races around one of a selection of pre-built
tracks. The music is fun, and the game is not too hard to play, which means
that even Aideen can play without too much trouble. I've seen some games
of this type that take the physics to the extreme, making them incredibly
hard to play well. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tux Kart</em></span>, thankfully, does not fall into this category.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tux Paint</em></span> (/usr/bin/tuxpaint) is a great kids-targeted drawing
program. The sound is great, the effects are wonderful and it is
easy to use. Aideen spends more time in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tux Paint</em></span> than in all of the
other installed programs combined, and Aaron enjoys using it, too. The
in-built collection of stamper shapes especially are appreciated by our
budding Picassos.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tux Racer</em></span> (/usr/games/tuxracer) is the one program that's fired-up and
shown-off whenever either of the boys have a friend over to play.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tux Racer</em></span> is, quiet simply, one very cool program. Watching Tux slide on his
belly at 90km/ph in stunning, realistically rendered graphics
remains&mdash;for me, anyway&mdash;one of the best examples of just how
far Linux has come as a multimedia platform.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tux Type</em></span> (/usr/games/tuxtype) is a fun typing tutor. All three of the kids
play it, and Aideen loves the way Tux eats the letters as they drop from
the sky and correctly are identified on the keyboard. Aideen especially
likes the cartoon-type sound effects and animation that occur when Tux
eats a fish at the last possible moment, which usually results in
Tux making a mad dash across the screen.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>X Tux</em></span> (/usr/games/xtux) is a 2-D, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pac
Man</em></span>-type game that works well and is fun to play. Although not
as popular with the boys as <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tux Racer</em></span> or
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Super Tux</em></span>, it still is played quite often.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8288f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Problems</h2></div></div><p>
Thankfully, there are no show-stopper problems to report. The Warty Warthog release of Ubuntu did have some problems with
sound. After a restart or a new login, the sound configuration would be
lost, resulting in no more sound. Upon investigation, I discovered that
the GNOME volume controls were being set automatically to zero. To
fix this temporarily, I popped a shortcut to the GNOME Volume Control
applet on the desktop and then used it to reset all the volume sliders. This
fixed the sound problem, until the next restart or login, of course. I
planned to research a permanent fix but then quickly realized that the
complaints about the new computer having no sound had stopped. It turned
out that Aaron had watched me fiddle with the volume controls, he'd told
his siblings what to do, and all three of them had developed the habit
of sliding up the volume controls immediately after logging in.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd1580.0x22c39b0"></a>
Upgrading Ubuntu</h2></div></div><p>
In the last few weeks, I upgraded the PC to the most recent release of
Ubuntu, Hoary Hedgehog. This resulted in much merriment, primarily
because of the inclusion of a newer release of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Super
Tux</em></span> that, I'm told, is much
better, has improved graphics, animation and sound. Speaking of sound,
this Ubuntu release is better but still has a few problems. Any that
surfaced were all fixable, permanently, and all I needed to do was
search the Ubuntu support wiki for sound and the name of the program
that was misbehaving. The fixes found in the wiki worked, and sound is
no longer a problem.
</p><p>
With the upgrade, Joseph asked if the shared login ID could be replaced
by individual IDs, which I did. This is less to do with privacy and more
to do with his little sister's fondness for pressing the Delete key
when viewing Joseph's <span   class="emphasis"><em>K Tuberling</em></span> Tux family collections. By the way,
Tux's family has been extended to include cousins, friends and neighbors.
</p><p>
Once the novelty factor started to wear off, I began to get requests
for some of their older software titles. Most of these, despite being
targeted to Mac OS, did come in dual-install format, in that they can be
installed on Windows too. In an effort to see how much work was involved,
I decided to play around with Wine in an attempt to install some of the
titles the kids were asking for. After a few hours of research on
the Internet and some reading, I spent about a day trying to get the
latest release of Wine to work on Ubuntu. I managed to run
the installers successfully for a lot of the Windows titles that the kids had, but none of
the programs would run properly once installed, so I had to abandon the
effort. Since giving up&mdash;and since the upgrade to the latest
Ubuntu&mdash;the requests for the older titles have become less frequent; although
Aaron misses one of the freebie, cereal-pack soccer games that he used to
play on his Mum's laptop. As I finish off this article, I'm in the process
of downloading and evaluating a small collection of Linux soccer games
from <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Linux Game Tome</em></span>. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Eat The
Whistle</em></span> technology looks the most promising. If this does not
satisfy Aaron's craving for a soccer game, I plan to dedicate additional time to
configuring Wine.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd1580.0x22c3cc8"></a>
Is Linux Ready for Kids?</h2></div></div><p>
The answer is yes, of course it is! It's not that Linux is a better
platform than the others for kids to use, it's that Linux is as good
as any other. Children are happy to sit down and play with most
any computer as long as the software titles provided are engaging and
fun. This is true of Linux, Windows and Mac OS. Of course, the point
to make is that if Linux is as good as the others, there's nothing
stopping anyone from using Linux as a primary OS for children. It's not
a case of &ldquo;is Linux ready for kids?&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;why
not Linux for kids?&rdquo;
</p><p>
The Barry household has made the move to Linux and won't be turning
back. The wealth of software available on the Internet and within Ubuntu's
Debian archives has been only scratched. There's loads out there for
me to evaluate and install for my kids as they grow out of the programs
they currently are enjoying. If you have any suggestions for programs
you think they might like, drop me a note and we'll take a look.
