To understand the IT industry, start with <span   class="emphasis"><em>On
Bullshit</em></span> by Harry G. Frankfurt. Prof. Frankfurt
poses, but doesn't answer, the question of why there
is so much B.S. in our society. He compares his
subject to shoddy construction, and that's an analogy
we can work with, because in software we're working
at the thrilling edge of language and craftsmanship.
We have the tools for dealing with B.S. in computer
languages. Try to B.S. a compiler and that's a bug.
It's time to tackle the B.S. problem head-on and
start reporting bugs in human communications too.
</p><p>
Consider this filler, I mean essay, to be a bug
report on the big companies that are doing Linux for
the desktop. &ldquo;Let's 'position' Linux as a simplified
desktop for 'transactional users'&rdquo;, they say. That's
right&mdash;employees, if your company gives you Linux,
that means Management thinks you're a human servlet.
Decision-makers and content creators get a proprietary
desktop OS.
</p><p>
Of course, offending the employees' pride might
not show up on a TCO spreadsheet. But no executive
would want to admit to running a division full of
transactional, replaceable, outsourceable &ldquo;human
resources&rdquo;.
</p><p>
But what about Clayton Christensen, disruptive
innovation and <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Innovator's Dilemma</em></span>?
Doesn't the cheap, good-enough contender always grow
the features and stability it needs to win? Yes,
when it lets in the customers left pressing their
noses against the Expensive Stuff Store window.
The Macintosh lets you do layouts even if you can't
afford phototypesetting. Linux lets you put up a Web
server without blowing the price of a Coupe De Ville
on a UNIX box.
</p><p>
But selling less-capable products to customers who
can get the good stuff doesn't fly. Seen an F-20 at
an air show lately? It was a capable airplane, but it was
positioned as an &ldquo;export fighter&rdquo; for air forces that
weren't allowed to have, or couldn't afford, the F-16.
Naturally, countries held out for the &ldquo;real&rdquo; fighter.
Information freedom ideals can only go so far when
vendors are patronizing Linux customers. &ldquo;Aww,
the little transaction worker filled out a Web form!
Isn't that cute?&rdquo;
</p><p>
Desktop Linux marketing is doing more harm than good,
but work is under way to make Linux out-perform the
other OSes. Robert Love's Project Utopia is bringing
together the desktop interface and the necessary
tweaking of hardware to make things work smoothly,
not just securely (page 66).
</p><p>
Michael George has an example of how a thin-client
environment almost works to solve a problem, but the
project needed one key local app, the soft phone.
See a hybrid approach to a VOIP station that works
as a phone and a PC on page 72.
</p><p>
One of the projects where software excellence, not
transaction-workerism, has triumphed, is Mozilla
Firefox. Mozilla expert and author Nigel McFarlane
died last month, leaving us with one last article
(page 52). Let Firefox serve as an example for the
standards the desktop is coming to meet.
