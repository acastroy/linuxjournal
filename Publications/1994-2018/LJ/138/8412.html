If your computer's clock is wrong, scheduled tasks,
such as backup and virus scans, might run during
the day, or your log files could become worthless.
The pool.ntp.org project has an answer.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23ff580.0x24f72f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In theory, setting a computer's clock over the network
is easy: simply send a query to the time server and
get the current time in return. For low-precision
usage on a trusted network, this process does indeed work
fine, as demonstrated by the old UNIX &ldquo;time&rdquo;
protocol. For today's Internet, however, and for millisecond
(ms) or even sub-ms precision, problems such as
authentication, reliability of the time servers and
network delays need to be considered. This is where
the Network Time Protocol (NTP), with its reference
implementation, steps in. The specification and
the reference implementation are being written by
Professor David Mills of the University of Delaware,
his graduate students and many other volunteers.
</p><p>
To allow everybody to use NTP to synchronise
computers' clocks over the public Internet,
Prof. Mills has long maintained a list of public
time servers. Most of these servers are operated
by universities or national standardisation
organisations. Today, this list is maintained by
the NTP Public Services Project, under the umbrella
of the Internet Systems Consortium. However, the
growth of the Internet and the prevalence of small,
cheap appliances, such as cable or DSL routers, with
built-in NTP clients lead to a rapidly growing load
on these public time servers. One of the most famous
cases involved a severe firmware problem in a range of such
devices, resulting in more than 150Mbps of NTP traffic
to the University of Wisconsin's NTP server.
</p><p>
After reading the discussion of one time server operator's request to
be taken off the public time servers list, I wondered if there was
a better approach to this whole problem&mdash;instead of having tens of
thousands of clients targeting one single time server, the load should
be distributed on many different time servers all over the network. So I
went ahead and created the original time.fortytwo.ch DNS round-robin
in January 2003. The project quickly acquired many interested volunteers
and was well received by Prof. Mills and his team. It soon became
the pool.ntp.org project with a somewhat more official status.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23ff580.0x24f7500"></a>
The Road Ahead</h2></div></div><p>
During the next two years, the project continued to grow, thanks to all
the people who mentioned it in various Web forums, HOWTO
documents and the like. Today, the project consists of more than
300 servers, offering service to tens of thousands of clients, in a very
rough estimate. Also, pool.ntp.org is now the default time server in several
operating system distributions, including Debian GNU/Linux, NetBSD
and Gentoo Linux.
</p><p>
So far, the growth in servers could more or less match the growth of
the user base of the project. However, the future remains challenging,
and discussions on the project's discussion mailing list have
shown that the project needs to deal with an inherent conflict between
providing easy service for as many clients as possible and assuring good
quality of the time servers participating in the project. That aside,
the big challenges for the near and medium future are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
IPv6 integration.
</p></li><li><p>
More automation&mdash;currently, I process server additions and removals mostly
manually.
</p></li><li><p>
Better, more novice-friendly documentation on the Web.
</p></li><li><p>
Of course, we always need more servers too.
</p></li><li><p>
And above all, we need to deal with abusive clients. In one example, the
six worst clients were responsible for 25% of the traffic on one
time server.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Although the first three items are not technically difficult and the
&ldquo;getting more servers&rdquo; plan should see a big leap ahead with the
publication of this article, we don't currently have a good plan to
educate the hundreds of users with sub-optimally configured clients.
Due to their number, they are a serious problem for the project. At
the same time, the bandwidth per client is small enough that the big ISPs'
abuse departments are not prepared to help in any way.
</p><p>
In the medium to long term, we will need to face
the issue that DNS round-robin, as currently
implemented, is not a good solution for
load balancing on the scale of several hundred
servers with a hundred thousand or more clients.
Wide deployment of IP multicast together with the
existing multicast support in ntpd would
be a good solution to this problem, but obviously
not one the NTP and pool.ntp.org crew can deploy on
their own. Another possible solution is to make the
ntpd d&aelig;mon aware of the pool.ntp.org project and,
in some generic way, similar such databases and have
the d&aelig;mon configure itself to use such a resource.
</p><p>
Finally, on a personal note, I honestly can say that it was fun to get
this project started and see it grow, but I now see the need for
somebody new, with fresh ideas, to take over from here. Indeed, as I
write this, I am talking with several people about the project's future,
and I am certain that the involvement of a new &ldquo;father
figure&rdquo; will do the project much good as new ideas are looked at
and implemented by a new crew.
