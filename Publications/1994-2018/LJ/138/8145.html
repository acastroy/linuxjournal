When it's time to get a new device working on Linux,
every piece of information helps, whether it's
reading the hardware documentation, snooping data,
reading sample code or even running utilities on a
non-Linux OS.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2834580.0x292c240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The Matrix is a USB bill validator, sometimes
known as a note reader or bill acceptor, made by Validation Technologies International.
The
bundled software was developed for Microsoft Windows, but fortunately
the device comes with low-level technical documentation that defines
device-specific aspects, such as flow control, status bytes and local
status LEDs.
</p><p>
The device is a Human Interface Device (HID), as
identified by an enumeration process upon connection.
The Windows device manager reports the device
as such, as does usbfs on Linux. This article is specific
to this particular HID device, so including all of its code
probably is unnecessary, but it should provide help for
developing for other HID-class devices.
</p><p>
After some initial research, I decided to develop
user-space code using an in-development library called libhid,
which provides a cross-platform way to access and interact with
USB HID devices. libhid is implemented on top of libusb,
so it does not depend directly on the kernel's USB support.
</p><p>
Another option for driving the Matrix is to use
libusb directly, but doing so would be re-inventing
the libhid wheel. A third option is to implement the Matrix
as a kernel module, but it would incur the large overhead of learning
kernel particulars. This option also would render the code
platform-specific.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2834580.0x292c450"></a>
Investigation</h2></div></div><p>
USB devices are categorized into device classes. A modem is in the
communications class, and a speaker falls into the audio class. The HID
class mainly consists of devices that people use to control computers.
Examples of HID devices are mice, joysticks and force-feedback game
controllers. Also included in the HID class are devices that may not
require human interaction but do provide data in a similar format to
HID-class devices, such as bar-code readers and, in my case, the Matrix
note reader.
</p><p>
Information about a USB device is stored in segments
of its ROM called descriptors. A diagram of
the descriptor structure is provided in Figure 1, where
an overall view of the hierarchy can be seen. When a
USB device is attached to a USB bus, an enumeration
process takes place that equates to the descriptors
on the device being read into memory. Information
about an HID-class device is contained in its HID
report descriptors.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8145f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. A USB device's descriptors, stored in its
ROM, hold information about it.
</p></div></div><p>
I plugged the device in to the Linux box in order to read the descriptors
and monitor the device, the machine and the communications. I did this
to try to get as much information as possible so I could have a better
understanding of how to write code for the device.
</p><p>
A key component of these report descriptors is the
usage information, which is defined in the USB HID
Usage Tables (see the on-line Resources). Usage values describe three
basic types of information about the device:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Controls&mdash;information about the state of the device such as on/off or
enable/disable.
</p></li><li><p>
Data&mdash;all other information that passes between the device and the
host.
</p></li><li><p>
Collections&mdash;groups of related controls and data.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Taken together, the usage page and usage number define
a unique constant that describes a particular type
of device or part of that device. For example, on
the Generic Desktop usage page (page number 0x01),
usage number 0x05 is a game pad, and usage number
0x39 is a hat switch.
</p><p>
Because my device is unique&mdash;it isn't a mouse,
joystick or something commonly found in the examples
of HID-class devices&mdash;the usage page is set to 65,440,
which is a vendor-defined value. In comparing
outputs of lsusb for other HID-class devices, they
all had a defined usage page, such as Generic Desktop
Controls or Game Controls. Because libhid still is in
development, few previous examples of code are available to
browse for reference. My work was much like an exploratory
investigation.
</p><p>
On Linux, with a standard Debian 2.6.9 kernel and usbutils, I was
able to see that Linux recognises the device as a USB HID device,
bInterfaceClass = HID, and loads the hiddev kernel module. This module,
or piece of kernel code, is a generic driver for HID devices. It is not
specific to our needs&mdash;it mainly is used for mice, joysticks and
the like&mdash;so it needs to be detached from the device or disabled
(see the Communicating with the Device section).
</p><p>
The device, like all USB devices, is enumerated upon connection to the
USB bus. So looking at the output of <tt  >lsusb -vvv</tt>,
run as root, for more information is helpful in determining what the
device capabilities are. lsusb parses the usbfs filesystem into a more
readable format:

<pre     class="programlisting">

The above output&mdash;some of the information has been omitted&mdash;follows the
hierarchy depicted in Figure 1. Some values of note are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
idVendor and idProduct&mdash;unique identifiers for all USB devices,
used for identifying and accessing the device in code.
</p></li><li><p>
bNumEndpoints&mdash;lists the number of endpoints available in a device.
This value actually means the number of endpoints in addition to the default
endpoint, endpoint 0, available in every USB device.
</p></li><li><p>
bInterfaceClass&mdash;the value that determines that a device is an HID-class
device.
</p></li><li><p>
bInterfaceSubClass&mdash;the subclass of a device, in this case, HID. For
example, the boot interface subclass of the device must be bootable or
available to the BIOS, such as a mouse or keyboard.
</p></li><li><p>
bInterfaceProtocol&mdash;the protocol used. Possible values are 0 for
none, 1 for keyboard or 2 for mouse; additional information is available
in the HID spec.

Communicating with the Device</h2></div></div><p>
A block diagram depicting the flow of control of data is shown in Figure
2. It may help in picturing where your code fits in with respect to the
libraries and the device. From my investigation, I know that control messages
periodically are written by way of the control pipe, and interrupt reads are
made through endpoint 0.
</p><p>
The control pipe is used for three tasks: receiving and responding to requests
for USB control and class data; transmitting data when polled by the HID class
driver, using the Get_Report request; and receiving data from the host.
The Interrupt pipe is used for two tasks: receiving asynchronous, or
unrequested, data from the device and transmitting low-latency data to the
device.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8145f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The new driver uses libhid, which depends on libusb.
</p></div></div><p>
The kernel has a DEBUG feature that
can be activated in order to log extra information
about what is happening when communicating
with the device. To do this, a file in the
kernel source needs to be modified. In the
/usr/src/linux/drivers/usr/input/hid-core.c file,
these two lines need to be changed from:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#undef DEBUG
#undef DEBUG_DATA
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2834580.0x292d478"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#define DEBUG
#define DEBUG_DATA
</pre>
</p><p>
The module needs to be recompiled and installed. Once this is done, the
modules should prove helpful in determining whether your code is working and
doing what you expect.
</p><p>
Sample code containing some helpful comments comes with libhid. The
file test_libhid.c in the libhid/test directory is a good place to start
writing code for the device. Below is a snippet of that code, along with
some more explanation of the functions; details are omitted for brevity:


<pre     class="programlisting">

HIDInterface* hid;
hid_return ret;

HIDInterfaceMatcher matcher =
	 { 0x0ce5, 0x0003, NULL, NULL, 0 };
ret = hid_force_open(hid, 0, &amp;matcher, 3);

int const PATH_LEN = 2;
int const PATH_IN[2] = { 0xffa00001, 0xffa00003 };

int const WRITE_PACKET_LEN = 8;
char write_packet[8] =
	 { 0x04,0x7f,0x7f,0x00,0x02,0x00,0x00,0x00 };

int const READ_PACKET_LEN = 5;
char read_packet[5];

ret = hid_set_output_report(hid,
 PATH_IN,
 PATH_LEN,
 write_packet,
 WRITE_PACKET_LEN);

ret = hid_interrupt_read(hid,
 USB_ENDPOINT_IN+1,
 read_packet,
 READ_PACKET_LEN,
 0);

</pre>
</p><p>
The first thing to do is identify the particular
device we want to talk to. This is done with the
HIDInterfaceMatcher call simply by entering the
vendor ID and the product ID. These two identifiers
are all that is required to identify any USB
device. If you have more than one identical device, it is possible to
separate them by serial number, that is, two matrix note readers would have
the same vendor ID and product ID but different serial numbers. The
HIDInterfaceMatcher call can do this; see the comments in the test_libhid.c
file.
</p><p>
After some variable setup, the next is to detach the kernel driver
from the HID device. Upon insertion of the HID device, the kernel
usually loads the usbhid module, which we don't want. We do have a few
options, however, for unloading it or for not loading it in the first
place. One such way is to enter this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost #&gt; modprobe -r usbhid
</pre>
</p><p>
When the hid_force_open function runs, it attempts, n times, to detach
the device before it fails. The device is now free from any control,
so our code now &ldquo;opens&rdquo; the device. As with any USB device,
it is necessary to send control information to the device to activate
it. This information must be sent periodically in order for the device
to remain active. If the control poll stops, the device deactivates
after a certain timeout.
</p><p>
Writing to a device requires the HID usage path and its length, plus a packet
and its length. To find this out, we need to parse the usage
tree&mdash;the output of <tt  >lsusb -vvv</tt>&mdash;and obtain the path
to the interface we want. As with everything else, there are various
methods for determining the path. At this stage, a lot of time was spent determining what
path to write to, and a number of tools are helpful here, such as:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
The test_libhid.c code: when the correct vendor and product ID
are entered in the code, the function hid_dump_tree, which uses the
MGE hidparser (see Resources), which parses the HID usage tree and places the
available usages at its leaves, outputs the available paths.
</p></li><li><p>
A Windows application available from Arnaud, one of the libhid authors,
also parses the usage tree and produces a nice GUI output, as shown in
Figure 3.
</p></li><li><p>
By parsing the output of <tt  >lsusb -vvv</tt>, run
as root, it is possible to parse the tree manually to determine the
path. This process is explained in the comments of test_libhid.c code.
</p></li></ol></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8145f3.large.jpg"><img src="8145f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Understanding a device: one way to browse
the available nodes of the HID tree is to use
the SystemSoft HID Browser.
</p></div></div><p>
From the above methods, we now have a path value we can use for the
hid_set_output_report. Once we know where to write to, it's a
matter of what to send. This information should be in the technical
documentation that comes with the device, and it can be verified with the
USB-sniffing tools. As with the particular device I was using,
verifying the format of a packet with the sniffing tools turned out to be
important, as the information in the documentation didn't match what the sniff
log reported (see the Snooping section).
</p><p>
Once the control message or output report is sent, we can start to
read from the read pipe, endpoint0. The function needed is an interrupt
read function. It already exists in libusb, but a corresponding libhid
function doesn't. The developers of libhid simply hadn't come across
a device that required it yet, so I studied the format of the other
functions and implemented it appropriately. I also added a new error
code to the existing list. These additions are being considered for
inclusion in the latest version of libhid.
</p><p>
At this stage, once the interrupt read value is stored, I then parse
this value, as per the Matrix documentation, to display the results
to the user. For this device, that equates to information such as,
&ldquo;A ten-euro note has been inserted&rdquo; or &ldquo;The cash box is
disconnected&rdquo; and other such device-specific information. The
details are unnecessary for the purposes of this article, but if anyone
requires this detail, feel free to contact me.
</p><p>
This process is repeated for as long as the driver is running. We
must keep polling the device to keep it active. There is a status LED
on the device that turns green when the device is active and remains
orange when inactive. The goal for quite some time was to make the
little light go green.

Snooping</h2></div></div><p>
Snooping can be done with a number of utilities.
This is where I learned about the discrepancies between
what the Matrix documentation says and what actually
happens:

</pre>
</p><p>
From the snoop log, we see the control message sent to the device at
the start, followed by a series of interrupt reads. According to the
documentation, &ldquo;The Host sends [a] poll to request information from Matrix
at a periodic rate. Matrix answers to the poll and reports all the
happening events.&rdquo; So, my interpretation of this was to send periodic
control write messages to the device and read the responses from the
interrupt endpoint. Also according to the documentation, the format of the write
message is five bytes in length, so with this information, I used the test_libhid.c
file included with libhid to see what happens. I found that functions within libhid
give error codes if they fail and that the /var/log/messages file,
with the extra DEBUG information from the modified kernel file, reports
useful errors.
</p><p>
Upon closer inspection of the snoop log, I saw that
the control write was, in fact, eight bytes in length.
See SetupPacket in snoop log output. The five bytes
described in the documentation seemed to represent
the first five bytes of the packet, and the last three bytes
seemed to be padding. That is, changing these last three bytes
doesn't seem to affect the operation. Subsequent
error-free testing, with the packet set to eight bytes,
confirmed that the documentation had been misleading.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
In terms of where to start with this project, I found the mailing list
for libhid to be helpful. The libusb mailing list also provided
guidelines. The Linux usbutils are quite useful in determining what
interfaces are available on the device and the meaning of the descriptors.
</p><p>
The libhid source code, still in constant development,
also is a source of help. Because the code constantly is
being developed, it is a good idea to keep an eye
on the Subversion repository for changes, including
documentation changes such as helpful comments in
the code.

Special thanks to Charles Lepple and Arnaud Quette, the original authors
of libhid, and also to Martin F. Krafft, who later joined and led the
rewrite. They all provided me with a lot of help, and without them I
certainly wouldn't have gotten my little light to go green.

Also, thanks to my supervisor, Dr Paul O'Leary, at WIT, for his
encouragement and analytical skills. It always is good to have an experienced
pair of eyes to guide me in the right direction.
