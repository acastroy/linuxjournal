&ldquo;Edison's light bulb was important not because he was the first
with the idea; as many as ten others envisioned similar schemes. Rather
it was significant because he conceived not just a bulb but a whole
electrified world.&rdquo;&mdash;Teresa Riordan, <span   class="emphasis"><em>US
News</em></span>

We've been fighting closed and proprietary software for a long time
now. And we've had lots of success&mdash;enough, I think, that we need to
move to the next stage: to the marketplace. We can see the problem when
we look at how many closed systems have open foundations: Google and
Amazon on Linux, Apple's Mac OS X and Yahoo's search infrastructure on BSD.
Also, countless closed Web habitats served up by Apache.
</p><p>
Am I being unfair here? Perhaps a little. You can't be open in every
possible respect, right? Some stuff needs to be locked down or closed
off. Customer data, future product plans, trade secrets and &ldquo;secret
sauces&rdquo;
of one kind or another. But those aren't the issue.
</p><p>
The real issue is silos: closed habitats that serve as private
marketplaces that lock customers in and competitors out.
</p><p>
Dick Hardt of Sxip Networks gives a killer talk about &ldquo;Identity
2.0&rdquo;. As
Dick puts it, Identity 1.0 is a province of walled gardens. Amazon,
eBay, Flickr and Skype are all walled gardens. They may be lovely places
to hang out, but they are also enclosed and private market spaces, as
false in their own way as the faux Venetian canals and Parisian streets
in Las Vegas hotels.
</p><p>
What makes them most different from closed systems of the traditional
sort is not a lack of interoperability&mdash;often they have that&mdash;but
the lock-in of personal data. You can't take your eBay reputation, or
the business you've built inside eBay's walled garden, over to Amazon.
Even trivial data, such as your Skype contact list, isn't portable. It's
locked inside a space that is not your own.
</p><p>
To hear Dick describe it, Identity 1.0 is barely past medieval. It's a
country of duchies and city states. But since we're so used to it, we
can barely think outside its walls. Yet that's where we belong, he says.
The world we want&mdash;the Identity 2.0 world&mdash;is one of independent
actors: free-range customers, conducting business and building
relationships in ways that each individual controls and that work with
many different vendors.
</p><p>
The problem with the walled garden metaphor is that all the familiar
examples are native to the Web. Silos, on the other hand, are
everywhere, both on the Web and off. Nearly every familiar business category
you can name&mdash;banking, hospitality, retailing, commercial aviation,
car rental...even office equipment, such as copiers and printers&mdash;is
a forest of silos. Take airlines. I am a registered frequent flyer with
United, American, Delta, America West and Southwest. Yet the only common
way I can relate to any of the five is money. None of my data in the
United silo is available for my dealings with American or Delta.
</p><p>
We've lived in a world packed with silos for so long that we now confuse
them with a free marketplace. We actually believe that a choice of silos
comprises all the conditions required for a free market. We can see how
limited this is when we look at the market category we call computers. A
quarter century ago, we thought the category was free and open because
we had a choice of silos from IBM, Digital, Data General, Wang and HP.
We thought the same way about networks when our choices were OmniNet,
WangNet, IBM Token Ring, Sytek, Corvus, 3Com and Ungermann-Bass.
</p><p>
I remember a long conversation I had with Ralph
Ungermann about how his company's goods were &ldquo;open&rdquo;
because they interoperated with other networks. In
a relative sense, they may have been. But the market
was essentially a field of silos. What he offered
was inter-silo-operability. Good for its day, but
nothing like the Net that was to come&mdash;and which
didn't come from any one vendor at all.
</p><p>
I remember Earl Gillmor talking about silos, way back in 1980. Earl
enjoyed a small measure of notoriety as a member of a splinter group at
Data General that lost &ldquo;the shoot-out at the Holiday Inn&rdquo; in Durham,
North Carolina&mdash;an event immortalized in the early pages of Tracy
Kidder's book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Soul of a New Machine</em></span>. After the shoot-out, Earl
left DG and formed a new systems integration company in Raleigh called
BAS, for Business Application Systems. BAS's goal was to produce what
they called &ldquo;machine-independent software&rdquo;. To be independent, Earl
explained, you needed software that was independent of every hardware
vendor's silo.
</p><p>
One day, early in my company's relationship with BAS, Earl explained the
ideals of machine independence, all of which are familiar to anybody
acquainted with open source today. (Although, naturally, BAS's code was
proprietary.) When he was done with his rap, my business partner asked
the impolite question, &ldquo;So how do you make your money?&rdquo; &ldquo;We're
whores&rdquo;,
Earl replied. &ldquo;We walk the streets with the rest of them.&rdquo; His point:
they had no choice&mdash;except among silos. (BAS, it turned out, bet on the
wrong silo: Texas Instruments' DS990s.)
</p><p>
Silo was just one container metaphor kicking around in those days.
Others were smokestacks and stovepipes. Today those metaphors have
fallen behind silo in popularity. I suspect that's because silos are
completely contained. Unlike smokestacks and stovepipes, they don't have
an opening at the top.
</p><p>
The prototypical office building is a silo of sorts. With its security
systems, its employee and visitor badges, it comprises what David
Wieinberger calls &ldquo;Fort Business&rdquo;:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
This fort is, at its heart, a place apart. We report there every
morning and spend the next eight, ten or twelve hours inaccessible
to the &ldquo;real&rdquo; world. The portcullis drops not only to keep out our
enemies, but to separate us from distractions such as our families.
As the drawbridge goes up behind us, we become businesspeople,
different enough from our normal selves that when we first bring our
children to the office, they've been known to hide under our desks,
crying.
</p><p>
Within this world, the Web looks like a medium that exists to allow
Fort Business to publish on-line marketing materials and make credit-card
sales easier than ever....The Web isn't primarily a medium for
information, marketing or sales. It's a world in which people meet,
talk, build, fight, love and play. In fact, the Web world is bigger
than the business world and is swallowing the business world whole.
The vague rumblings you're hearing are the sounds of digestion.
</p><p>
The change is so profound that it's not merely a negation of the
current situation. You can't just put a big &ldquo;not&rdquo; in front of Fort
Business and say, &ldquo;Ah, the walls are coming down.&rdquo; No, the true
opposite of a fort isn't an unwalled city. It's a conversation.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
David wrote that more than six years ago, in Chapter 6 of <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cluetrain
Manifesto</em></span>. We still aren't having the conversation required to bring the
walls down. True, there are some significant conversations growing out
of employee blogs. For example, nothing has done more to bring down
Microsoft's walls than interaction with outsiders by Robert Scoble, Kim
Cameron (a subject of last month's column) and about 2,000 other
blogging Microsoft employees.
</p><p>
But the problem isn't communication. It's the structure of markets
themselves. I'm not talking about structure in an architectural sense,
but in a deeper way that's more like geology. Because the Internet is
geological, not just architectural. It has a nature that goes deeper
than whatever structures private efforts can provide. But that nature is
hard to see when your frames of reference are closed and proprietary.
</p><p>
Like many in the Linux community (including my good
friend Eric Raymond), I have strong Libertarian
sensibilities. I understand the liberating
advantages of private property to societies and their
economies. Ownership matters, and ownership works. But
we in the Free Software and Open Source communities
also know there are some things that are beyond
the scope of ownership and the control ownership
naturally implies. Earth below the crust is as beyond
the practical scope of ownership as the weather
and the stars. Yet they provide us with services so
fundamental we couldn't live without them. One of
those services is a deep and easily ignored context for
property: gravity. Real estate would be meaningless
without the gravitational pull provided by a mass
we'll never see. The Net's geology is like that.
</p><p>
I've written many times about the NEA nature of the Net, and of all free
and open-source software: Nobody owns it, Everybody can use it and
Anybody can improve it. The same applies to markets, and it's time we
started improving the ones we've got, by putting silos in a context that
makes clear their limited advantages.
</p><p>
The Supreme Court missed a chance to do that with the Brand X case. In a
6&ndash;3 decision that was handed down on June 27, 2005&mdash;the same day as
Grokster, which is a big reason why not much of a fuss was made about
it&mdash;the Supremes upheld a 2002 FCC ruling that classified cable broadband
as a deregulated &ldquo;information service&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;telecommunications
service&rdquo;. Unpacked, that means the cable and telephone companies can
(and will) be exclusive Internet service providers. Independent ISPs
like Brand X and Earthlink, which don't own physical connections to
homes and businesses, are out of luck if the cable and phone companies
want to keep captive customers to themselves.
</p><p>
More importantly, the FCC's understanding of the Internet achieved the
stature of law with the Brand X decision. That understanding is
basically feature-rich broadcast. It's a concept of service anchored on
the supply side of the highly asymmetrical distribution system the FCC
has governed for most of the last century.
</p><p>
Former FCC Chairman Michael Powell, in a speech at the VON (Voice On the
Net) conference one year ago, said, &ldquo;To realize the innovation dream that
IP communications promises, however, we must ensure that a willing
provider can reach a willing consumer over the broadband
connection.&rdquo; He
generously acknowledged &ldquo;the importance of consumer
empowerment&rdquo; and
rights such as &ldquo;Freedom to Access Content&rdquo;, which he explained with
&ldquo;Consumers should have access to their choice of legal
content.&rdquo;
Generous as that may have been, it was no less top-down than anything
owned by Rupert Murdoch. Nowhere did he acknowledge the Net's most
profound commercial grace: supporting the ability of anybody to go into
business, and to do business, with anybody they please, anywhere.
</p><p>
Thomas Madsen-Mygdal, a young serial entrepreneur in Denmark who hosts
the delightful annual reboot conference in Copenhagen, recently told me
he likes and appreciates Flickr&mdash;the on-line photo gallery phenomenon
that has taken the world by storm (and which was built on LAMP)&mdash;but
that it has &ldquo;lock-in&rdquo; issues:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I don't mean &ldquo;a total lock-in&rdquo; in the traditional BigCo IT sense.
More like that if open data standards existed, the collective value
would be in the commons&mdash;not on one photo sharing site. The London
bombings wouldn't be about the &ldquo;flickr tag&rdquo;, but about the
&ldquo;photo
tag&rdquo; or just the <span   class="emphasis"><em>tag</em></span>&mdash;which in my book is much more aligned
with our values and the society we want to create.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Thomas' higher-level concern is that &ldquo;we're selling out on values of open standard and
decentralization&rdquo;. What Tim O'Reilly calls the
&ldquo;architecture of participation&rdquo;, Thomas says, is turning
into something that is &ldquo;based on silos&rdquo; in practice. So, he
adds,
&ldquo;I'm gonna try and push some open standards in the photo
sharing space to level the competition.&rdquo;
</p><p>
He'll do that, he says, by &ldquo;dividing what is the commons from
what is the product. That way, thousands of photo sharing products can
create a collective value that's a lot greater. Competition will be on
the product side, rather than on who aggregates most of the
commons.&rdquo; Thomas' site, 23people.com, is open for beta.
</p><p>
This month, O'Reilly is putting on its second Web 2.0 conference.
(Shouldn't they call it Web 2.1?) In September 2004, Tim O'Reilly
described Web 2.0 as &ldquo;the Internet as a platform&rdquo;. Then he
added:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We heard about that idea back in the late 1990s, at the height of the
browser wars, but that turned out to be a false alarm. But I believe
we're now starting the third age of the Internet&mdash;the first being
the telnet-era command-line Internet, the second the Web&mdash;and the
third, well, that tale grows in the telling. It's about the way that
open source and the open standards of the Web are commoditizing many
categories of infrastructure software, driving value instead to the
data and business processes layered on top of (or within) that
software; it's about the way that Web sites like eBay, Amazon and
Google are becoming platforms with rich add-on developer
communities; it's about the way that network effects and data,
rather than software APIs, are the new tools of customer lock-in;
it's about the way that to be successful, software today needs to
work above the level of a single device; it's about the way that the
Microsofts and Intels of tomorrow are once again going to blindside
established players because all the rules of business are changing.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
That was a lead-in to the Web 2.0 conference. After the conference, in
an interview with Richard MacManus, Tim said:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I actually ran a couple of panels on this at our Open Source
convention, a year and a half or two years ago&mdash;called &ldquo;Open
Data&mdash;Do We Need a Bill of Rights for Web Services?&rdquo; We had people from
Amazon, eBay and others trying to answer that question: what does it
mean when we're investing our on-line data in these sites? Will we
end up with something like the Open Source movement because the
companies have ended up locking in their users?
</p><p>
....But the actual data ownership is maybe less important, in some
areas, than people think. When we talk about user-contributed data,
we're not just talking about my data proper (as in having your mail
stored on Gmail or Yahoo! Mail or whatever). We're also talking
about a kind of content that users are contributing to a collective
work. So for example, Amazon Reviews&mdash;people don't really care
about that in the same way. They're not saying, &ldquo;Oh I created that
review and I want to be able to export it to Barnes &amp; Noble as
well.&rdquo; They're creating it in a particular context of that
community.
</p><p>
....Despite what I've said...data lock-in absolutely should be a
concern. I believe that data lock-in of various kinds is going to be
one of the key tools of business advantage in the Internet era. I
think that as companies realize this, they will figure out how to be
evil&mdash;so to speak (to use Google's terminology)&mdash;and I predict
that we will in fact have some major battles in that area.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
As I said last month, one answer is to create ways to do what Drummond
Reed calls &ldquo;Company Relationship Management&rdquo; (or CoRM), which should
look far more interesting and useful to companies than their own
Customer Relation Management (CRM) systems, which by nature have no view
outside the company's own silo. In fact, CRMs are one of the main ways
companies <span   class="emphasis"><em>maintain</em></span> their silos.
</p><p>
Another is to pay more attention to where the Net's deep, almost
geological market-making infrastructure comes from. It's not from the
physical cables that run to homes or from the &ldquo;services&rdquo; available
exclusively from cable and phone companies, but from the open protocols
that define the Net's environment. It's also not from fancy private
services inside corporate walled gardens but from the raw building
materials that make deploying those services so free and easy.
</p><p>
Which brings us back to the L in the LAMP suite that makes possible the
last phrase above.
</p><p>
What makes Linux so different, and so successful, is that it's not
designed as a silo. Linux didn't come from a silo, and it had no
ambitions to be a silo. At one point, Linus talked about &ldquo;world
domination&rdquo;, but his tongue was in his cheek&mdash;even if he was indulging
in prophesy that would prove out in the long run.
</p><p>
Linux was never a business. It was, and remains, a great way to build
anything, to support anything, for anybody. That's the fundamental
virtue we need to fight for when we go to battle.
</p><p>
Our battle, however, is not with the companies that use open code to
build walled gardens and silos. Our battle is with the closed, top-down
silo-oriented value system that has been with us since the dawn of the
Industrial Age. It's that lame old value system that prevents us from
imagining how we can improve markets that nobody owns and anybody can
improve.
</p><p>
The best way to shed the old mentality is to embrace our customers
and not only their money. Today the preponderance of inventiveness and
productivity is out in the free world, in the hands of free-range
individuals. Linus Torvalds is the prototypical example of one of those
individuals. There are countless more like him, producing all kinds of
goods, expressing all kinds of demand&mdash;much of which they are able to
supply for themselves, as Linus did, and with the help of others, as the
Linux community has done.
</p><p>
In fact, the only silo that matters is the most fundamental and
indivisible unit in the marketplace, the individual. What we need is to
create and support independence, not dependence.
</p><p>
Work to free individuals, and to take advantage of what they do with
that freedom, and you'll have a winning strategy in the new marketplace
we're all making together.
