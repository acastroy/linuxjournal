investor who thought that the value of office space in urban high
rises was about to take a big dive. His rationale was that
telecommuting was going to get <span   class="emphasis"><em>big</em></span> real soon.
Well, here we are five years down the road, and I don't think
telecommuting really has exploded. I've done it a couple of times.
Some people here at SSC telecommute a couple of days a week. But in
downtown Seattle, high rises are going up all over the place. On
any given day there are 10-20 construction cranes on the skyline.
</p><p>I wonder if my professional investor friend also was selling
interests in pulp and paper companies. Tomorrow's office will be
paperless, right?</p><p>Whether you telecommute or not, you probably use some form of
electronic connectivity to the office when you are not there. Can
you check your work e-mail at home? Do machines send e-mail to your
cell phone? Can you access your company's intranet from the Web?
Or, maybe you have never even been to the corporate headquarters,
and you rove the globe packing a laptop that connects to your
company's headquarters via a virtual private network (VPN).</p><p>If you don't have your VPN set up yet by your IT staff with
its unlimited budget, you might be interested in ssh.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span>--oh yeah, that's a
secure Telnet program, right? Yes, it is, and it's much, much more.
You're not still using Telnet, are you? Previous issues of
<i  >Linux Journal</i> have talked about the &ldquo;much,
much more&rdquo; of ssh (see Resources). In this article I show a
specific example of using ssh to do &ldquo;much, much more&rdquo;. I also
demonstrate how to use ssh's port-forwarding feature to connect the
printing systems on different networks across the Internet, at the
same time securing the data while in transit.</p><p>Imagine that you work at Example Company. Example Company has
a traditional office with a network of computers that contain all
the data and programs that you and the company use to produce
widgets. You are at home and use ssh to connect to Example's
network over the hostile-worm-infested-jungle known as the
Internet. <span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> allows you to log
in, read mail and start X11 programs. You also can use scp to pass
files back and forth securely. If you have a fast connection to the
Internet and through to your company's network, things can be very
similar to working at your desk inside the traditional office&mdash;up
until the time you want to burn a hard copy. What can you do? Well
you can print to a file, scp the file to your home computer and
submit the job to the local printer with lpr. This method works,
but it takes three steps and does not work if you cannot print to
file.</p><p>Hmmm...well you could turn all three steps into one big
command-line juggernaut. On your home computer, typing</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ssh -f rory@example.com cat secretdata | lpr
</pre><p>fires up an ssh session over to example.com and concatenates
the file called secretdata in your remote home directory. The f
option makes ssh go into the background after password
authentication but before the cat command is run. Piping to lpr
takes the standard out of ssh and directs it to standard in for lpr
on the local computer. As long as your home lpr system is working
and knows how to handle the file format of secretdata, out pops a
hard copy on your home printer. Now, where did you put that ream of
paper?
</p><p>It would be nice just to be working away in your shell at
Example Company and type <b  >lpr secretdata</b>. That
would save 30 typed characters and be easier to remember. What
about printing from a mail reader or printing a report from a
database application? An integrated print system would be even more
useful for these activities.</p><p>One way to make the printing system seamless is to set up a
relay system that gets the print job from the lpr system at
example.com and passes it over to the lpr system at home.</p><p>Let's do this by using the port-forwarding features of ssh.
What this does is allow you to connect an arbitrary port on your
local system to a port on the remote system or vice versa. Then you
can use programs that talk to a port to connect to the remote
machine. Let's look at an example. Say you wanted to run your
browser on your local machine but to look at your company's
intranet, which is hosted on the company server at example.com but
is not available to the public. Using ssh you forward the local
port 8080 to example.com's port 80 with the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ssh -L 8080:example.com:80 example.com
</pre><p>After authentication you get a shell on example.com. Then, on
your home computer open up your favorite browser, and enter the URL
http://localhost:8080/.
</p><p>Your browser sends its requests to the local port 8080, which
gets passed over to port 80 at example.com, which processes the
request and sends the answer back over the same channel to be
displayed in your browser. Similarly, you could do a MySQL query or
talk to an SMTP server by forwarding a local port to the
appropriate port on a remote host.</p><p>Now that we have a handle on forwarding ports, let's talk
about printing. First, we need a relay program that runs between
the two different lpr systems.</p><p>Let's use a client/server system. The idea is that when we
ssh to example.com, we fire up a local client program that connects
to a server over at example.com using a forwarded port. If the
server has a print job waiting, it sends it back to the client,
which passes it off to the local lpr.</p><p>Examples of a simple server and client are shown in Listing 1
and Listing 2 [Listing 2 is available at
<a href="../listings/094/5462.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue94/5462.tgz</a>].</p><p><a href="5462l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. rlserver</a></p><p>The server will be started by lpr on the remote system and
will run only if there is a print job waiting to be sent from the
remote machine over to the home machine. The remote lpr system host
is set up to pass the print job off to the rlserver program using
this entry in /etc/printcap:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Remote Printer for Rory
rory
        :lp=|/usr/local/scripts/rlserver 8888
        :sd=/var/spool/lpd/rory
        :lf=/var/spool/lpd/rory/log
        :mx#0
        :sh
</pre><p>Printcap entries vary slightly on lpr systems; this one is
for LPRng. The 8888 is an argument to rlserver telling it which
port should be used for Rory. Other users can be set up with
different ports&mdash;just make sure the ports aren't in use by some
other program. Ports 1-1024 usually require special privileges.
</p><p>What the client does is poll the server once every five
seconds. It connects to the local port that has been forwarded. If
there is a job waiting, then there is a server to connect to.
Otherwise the connection is refused and the client tries again in
five seconds. When a connection is made, the server sends the print
job data over to the client, which copies it down into a temporary
file. After the client receives all the data, the temporary file is
sent to the local lpr. Now there are a few other things we need to
do to set this up to run smoothly.</p><p>If you actually work in the corporate office part of the
time, you want to use the office printer while you are in the
office. But when you log in from home, you want the lpr-forwarding
printer to be selected. This can be set up automatically by using
an ssh feature and the shell initialization files. In
$HOME/.ssh/enviroment, add the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
REMOTE=yes
</pre><p>Once you ssh to a remote host, this variable will be set in
your remote environment.
</p><p>Next, add this stanza to your .bashrc on the remote
host:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if [ "$REMOTE" = "yes" ]; then
    PRINTER=printername
fi
</pre><p>This will set your printer to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>printername</em></span> when ssh starts a bash session.
Make sure printername is the same as what is set up in the printcap
file. If you don't use bash, do whatever your shell needs in its
startup file.
</p><p>Next, let's make sure the port forwarding takes place behind
the scenes. That way we can simply type <b  >ssh
example.com</b> without remembering a lot of options and port
numbers. Edit the $HOME/.ssh/config file, and add</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Host example.com
    LocalForward 8888 example.com:8888
</pre><p>This will forward the local port 8888 to example.com's port
8888.
</p><p>If you have a slow internet connection you may want to bump
up the compression level from the default of six. Add these two
lines before the host-specific sections of
$HOME/.ssh/config:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Compression yes
CompressionLevel 9
</pre><p>Copy the program rlclient (Listing 2) to your home computer.
Make sure the first line has the correct Python path in it. Execute
rlclient in a shell. In a separate shell ssh to example.com. Your
port 8888 should be forwarded, compression turned on, and your
printer variable all should be set up. Check the printer variable
with:
<pre     class="programlisting">
echo $PRINTER
</pre>


It should say whatever you set up as your printername.
</p><p>Now make sure your local (home) lpr system is up and running,
and send a file to print on the remote system (example.com):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
lpr mytestfile.txt
</pre><p>Check on the status of the print job with
<b  >lpq</b>. Also, watch the shell where rlclient is
running. It will display output of what is going on.
</p><p>I had some problems with new versions of ssh that use
Protocol 2 not forwarding ports or complaining each time rlclient
tried to connect. The error messages were of this sort:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
channel_request_forwarding: cannot listen to port: 8888
channel_open_failure: 3: reason 2 Connection refused
</pre><p>In these cases, it was necessary to force the protocol level
to 1 by using <b  >-1</b> on the command line or adding
Protocol 1 to the $HOME/.ssh/config file under the other entries
for example.com.
</p><p>In addition to the lpr client and server, I found two very
simple programs useful in debugging port forwarding. These are
called time.client.py and time.server.py (Listings 3 and 4,
respectively). Both programs take one argument, which is the port
number you want them to use. The server waits for connections,
sends out the time of day when it receives a connection, and the
client simply prints out the time. They can be used over ssh or on
the same machine.</p><p><a href="5462l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3.
time.client.py</a></p><p><a href="5462l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4.
time.server.py</a></p><p>Once everything is debugged, it is much easier to use a
script to start the rlclient in the background when sshing to
example.com. Then use the script (or an alias to the script) to
ssh:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
# Start up the rlclient and ssh to example.com.
$HOME/rlpr/rlclient &gt; $HOME/rlpr/log &amp;
echo "$!" &gt; $HOME/rlpr/pid
ssh example.com
kill -9 $(cat $HOME/rlpr/pid)
</pre><p>In this example, we have looked at how to relay print jobs
from one location to another over a port secured by ssh. Uses for
this port-forwarding feature are limited only by your imagination.
Go forth and ssh.
