    Laptops are cheap, WiFi cards are cheap and
    well-supported...maybe it's time to build your own LAN.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13fa580.0x14f26b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you've been to a Linux conference
lately, you've probably seen a lot of people with wireless network
cards, happily checking their e-mail while they sip refreshing
beverages. The 802.11b, or &ldquo;WiFi&rdquo;, cards are really cheap,
convenient and well supported under Linux.
</p><p>If you want to do wireless networking at home, though, just
plugging in a base station might not be too smart. Even with the
largest key sizes, the badly named Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
encryption protocol that WiFi uses is vulnerable to people walking
nearby&mdash;for large values of &ldquo;nearby&rdquo;. Security consultant Peter
Shipley reports connecting to WiFi networks 25 miles away using a
directional antenna. And as little as half an hour of intercepted
traffic could be enough time for someone to break WEP and get on
the Net using your base station (see Resources).</p><p>You can do some things to make WEP stronger, but it's
inadequate as protection. (Adobe Systems, Inc. reportedly shut down
all their WiFi base stations after they got the government to
arrest programmer Dmitry Sklyarov. They may be trying to set
software and free speech back 500 years, but they aren't
stupid.)</p><p>The threat to WiFi is not that people might read your
data&mdash;you're using ssh and SSL to protect sensitive information
anyway. The threat is people using the network you're responsible
for to do bad things. If a spammer or a script kiddie gets on the
Net using your base station, it's almost impossible to find him or
her. Who gets the blame? You do.</p><p>If you do decide to provide public connectivity via 802.11b,
that's mighty neighborly of you. Get a separate net connection, put
up a base station, join the relevant mailing lists and have fun. If
someone uses your public base station to send spam or break into
people's computers, and your ISP cancels the account, you'll still
have your regular net connection.</p><p>So if off-the-shelf base stations are bad, what's the
alternative? How about an old laptop? In case you haven't noticed,
prices are coming down, and you probably can get a new laptop with
half a gig of RAM and a 1600 &times; 1200 display for about eight
dollars by the time you read this. So treat yourself to a new
laptop and convert your old one into the base station. The on-line
auction sites also have made damaged laptops really cheap. Busted
hinge? Missing battery latch? Might not be the best thing to carry
around, but with a little duct tape, there's your base
station.</p><p>I put Debian on mine because it has packages for all the
software mentioned in this article and a good automatic upgrade
system. But any current distribution will work. (I didn't have to
compile anything from source or reboot to do this article, although
I did reboot a couple times after configuration to make sure
everything came up in the right order.)</p><p>I shouldn't have to say this, but buy WiFi cards that are
well supported by your distribution of choice. I got a pair of
Orinoco cards.</p><p>Since your base station will be exposed to anyone who walks
by with a WiFi card, take a few basic administration and security
measures (which apply to any internet server) before you plug the
card in.</p><p>First, forward root's mail to your real e-mail address, so
important messages don't go unread.</p><p>Check that log rotation is working and that plenty of space
is available in /var/log.</p><p>Configure the mailer d&aelig;mon to listen only on the
loopback interface.</p><p>Set up either ntpd or a cron job to run ntpdate, so all times
in the logs will be correct.</p><p>Remove all unused software, and apply any security fixes or
updates.</p><p>Copy your main ssh key into .ssh/authorized_keys2 in your
home directory on the base station, so that you never need to send
your password over the Net, even encrypted. Configure sshd to
refuse passworded or root logins.</p><p>Make sure you are subscribed to the security mailing list for
the distribution the base station is running.</p><p>Finally, run Nmap against the base station from outside to
make sure that no unnecessary services are running. From outside
you should see ssh and that's it.</p><p>Just in case your base station does get compromised, make
sure that no information or keys on the base station would help
people get into any of your other systems. For example, accounts on
the base station should not have ssh keys.</p><p>In this article, I use 10.2 addresses for the underlying
WiFi, and 10.3 addresses for the VPN. Now it's time to get on the
air.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13fa580.0x14f2df0"></a>Set up the PCMCIA Cards in the Base
Station</h2></div></div><p>The actual order of eth0, eth1 numbering depends on the order
in which the drivers are insmod-ed, and the cardmgr d&aelig;mon
probes the slots in order on boot. On my laptop (now base station)
the WiFi card and conventional Ethernet card will only fit if the
WiFi card is in the top slot, slot 0. That means that my WiFi
interface is eth0, and my regular Ethernet is eth1.</p><p>By default, when you boot the base station, the PCMCIA script
will start the cardmgr d&aelig;mon and possibly exit before all the
cards are initialized. If you're running a server of any kind, this
is not what you want to happen. All the interfaces should be up
before d&aelig;mons try to start. Pass the -f option to cardmgr by
putting it in the PCMCIA init script or configuration file; on
Debian it's /etc/pcmcia.conf (see Listing 1). Below is
/etc/pcmcia/wireless.opts:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# use "Ad-Hoc" mode to act as a base station.
# Set your own ESSID.
case "$ADDRESS" in
*,*,*,*)
    ESSID="wifi.ssc.com"
    MODE="Ad-Hoc"
    ;;
esac
</pre><p><a href="5470l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.
/etc/pcmcia/network.opts</a>
</p><p>To check your work, do an <b  >ifconfig</b> and an
<b  >iwconfig</b> on the base station, and make sure the
information is correct. Make sure that you can still log in to the
base station over the regular Ethernet.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13fa580.0x14f3160"></a>Set up WiFi on the Client</h2></div></div><p>All you should have to do is put in an extended service set
ID (ESSID) that matches the one on the base station.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13fa580.0x14f3268"></a>Set up the DHCP Server on the Base
Station</h2></div></div><p>To make the base station work as a DHCP server, you also will
need to add a route to 255.255.255.255, which is the destination
address for DHCP traffic. Unless the 255.255.255.255 route exists,
DHCP packets will take the default route instead of the WiFi
interface, which is not what you want. You can add this route to
the dhcp init script. While you're editing this script, make dhcpd
run it only on the WiFi interface (in the case of solanum, eth0).
You don't want the base station spewing DHCP traffic to places it
isn't wanted. So replace</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/sbin/dhcpd
</pre><p>with
<pre     class="programlisting">
route add -host 255.255.255.255 dev eth0
/usr/sbin/dhcpd eth0
</pre>


Set up a dhcpd.conf file on the base station to give out IP
addresses only to your own systems:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# /etc/dhcpd.conf for solanum
# run the DHCP server on the WiFi interface only!
default-lease-time 1800;
max-lease-time 7200;
subnet 10.2.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 {
}
subnet 198.144.202.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
}
host cannabis {
    hardware ethernet 00:02:2d:2e:56:df;
    fixed-address 10.2.0.2;
}
</pre>


This is not a security measure, but it will keep your DHCP server
from wasting time on any of your neighbors who set up their clients
incorrectly.
</p><p>At this point you should be able to ping the base station
from the client over WiFi.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13fa580.0x14f3528"></a>VPN</h2></div></div><p>There are many virtual private network (VPN) options for
Linux, and you might have one installed already for a different
reason. If so, you can skip installing a separate VPN just for
WiFi, and simply configure IP masquerading on the base station to
allow traffic only from the WiFi network to the VPN server and vice
versa, and you're done. If you need to set up a VPN between several
locations for travelers or for home offices, and you also need VPNs
for WiFi at each location, save time by picking one VPN that works
for both.</p><p>Otherwise, choose and install a VPN just for WiFi. For this
article, I chose vpnd (see Resources), which has the advantages of
working with an &ldquo;out-of-the-box&rdquo; kernel, being available as a
Debian package and being simple to configure.</p><p>The kernels of clients and the server will need to have the
kernel random number generator and SLIP support as a module. The
stock kernels that come with distributions have this, but if you
built your own kernel and didn't compile any modules you didn't
need then, you'll have to go back, <b  >make
menuconfig</b>, choose SLIP and then do:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make modules &amp;&amp; make modules_install.
</pre><p>The good news is that you don't have to reboot to do this if
you're running a modular kernel and still have the kernel source
and kernel .config that you built from. If you took out kernel
random number generator support, shame on you&mdash;put it back in, as
not only vpnd but much other fine crypto software depends on it.
</p><p>To set up keys for vpnd, run <b  >vpnd -m</b> on
the base station, then copy the resulting /etc/vpnd/vpnd.key to the
client. Configuration files for vpnd are pretty simple; Listing 2
shows an example.</p><p><a href="5470l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2.
/etc/vpnd/vpnd.conf</a></p><p>At this point you should be able to ping the base station's
virtual address (10.3.0.1 in this case) from the client, and vice
versa. If not, check the logs for vpnd errors, and use
<b  >ifconfig</b> and <b  >route</b> at both
ends to make sure the IP address and routing information are
correct.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13fa580.0x14f3a50"></a>IP Masquerading</h2></div></div><p>Every distribution has its own IP masquerading setup tool,
and IP masquerading articles are as common as pig tracks, so turn
it on however it says in the book. You will need to make sure that
the WiFi network (10.2.0.0/16 in our example) doesn't get
masqueraded&mdash;just the VPN. To test that masquerading is set up
correctly, don't only surf the Web and send mail from the
client&mdash;temporarily change the default route on the client to go
over the WiFi directly instead of the VPN, and make sure that you
can't.</p><p>Many exciting future developments in wireless networking are
on the way. Future security protocols should make the VPN dance
unnecessary, and community networks such as NoCatNet are working
out protocols to let you share your access point with neighbors
without opening yourself up to abuse. But, today's 802.11b cards
are going to be common and serviceable for a long time.</p><p><a href="5470s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
