    Although its reputation suggests the contrary Freenet does
    have many mirroring uses.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea5580.0x1f9d558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Freenet has generated a lot of hype for
being the &ldquo;son of Napster&rdquo; or some equally degrading report. For
Freenet to survive, it needs to get away from being just another
way to get illegal MP3s. In legal terms, Freenet needs &ldquo;massive
non-infringing use&rdquo;. Sorry, but getting the latest copy of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span> doesn't count as non-infringing.
</p><p>This article describes a use for Freenet that few will find a
problem with (unless you use an RPM-based distro, to which I say
&ldquo;Get a real package manager!&rdquo;). It also once again illustrates
the power of small, flexible tools that do one thing and do it
well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea5580.0x1f9d710"></a>I Want My .debs!</h2></div></div><p>As a Debian user who often uses my distribution of choice in
production environments, I am confronted with problems in choosing
mirror FTP sites from which to download new packages. Sometimes a
mirror site is already overloaded with users, sometimes it isn't
holding the packages I need and still other times it fails
completely. I could resort to using the official
<a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org" target="_self">ftp.debian.org</a>, but
that's not very polite. It would be nice if I didn't have to think
about any of this.</p><p>Fortunately, the creators of Freenet have given me an answer
and didn't even realize it at first. While Freenet has much to do
with anonymity, it also provides a highly efficient mirroring
system that no centralized system could hope to achieve.</p><p>The system described in this article requires no new code for
either Freenet or Apt-get. It employs a standard user interface
add-in for Freenet called FProxy, which originally was intended for
the user to access Freenet through a web browser. Since it
communicates with the browser via HTTP, and Apt-get already
understands how to talk HTTP, this process only requires running a
few simple commands and modifying the /etc/apt/sources.list.</p><p>Before proceeding, be sure to download the latest version of
Freenet (0.3.9.1 as of this writing, although it will probably
change by the time you read this) from
<a href="http://www.freenetproject.org" target="_self">www.freenetproject.org</a>.
Set up a node on your local machine and use some test files to
insert and request. Open your favorite browser and point it to
http://localhost:8081. If it brings up a page for requesting and
inserting files, everything should be set up correctly. Be warned
that it may take awhile for FProxy to come up, depending on the
speed of your machine and which Java Virtual Machine you're
running.</p><p>On a side note, you can get a Debian package that installs
Freenet for you. It is available either at the web site above or in
Debian unstable. Unfortunately, due to a buggy implementation of
the big number classes, Freenet cannot work on the current version
of Kaffe (1.0.6), and thus it can only run on a non-Free virtual
machine; you'll find it in &ldquo;contrib&rdquo;. If you have a problem with
this, you either can use a patched version of Kaffe, the latest CVS
version of Kaffe or wait until the next stable version arrives.
Current plans are to make future releases of Freenet compliable
under GCJ, which brings Java code into native machine code,
bypassing the problem of a non-Free VM completely.</p><p>In case you were wondering, Freenet makes rather heavy use of
strong cryptography, so you'll find it in the non-US area, too.
Edit your sources.list as needed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea5580.0x1f9da80"></a>What to Do</h2></div></div><p>FProxy was meant to be the default user interface for
Freenet. Although it is not a full proxy server, it communicates to
the browser through HTTP (this is what was shown earlier when you
opened up your browser to http://localhost:8081). After realizing
that Apt-get could already understand HTTP, it was seen that
getting packages from Freenet would be quite simple.</p><p>Before going any further, make a backup of your current
/etc/apt/sources.list. I didn't do this the first time, and it took
a few annoying hours to get that system to download packages
correctly again.</p><p>Now, add this line to the real sources.list:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
deb http://localhost:8081/debian-test/dists stable
</pre><p>For more information, see the sources.list(5) man page.
You'll need to modify http://localhost:8081 to reflect the port on
which FProxy is running. This port is set in the configuration file
.freenetrc, located in the top-level directory in which the Freenet
tarball was decompressed. If you used the Debian package, it will
be in /etc/freenet/freenetrc.
</p><p>You also need to add application/x-debian-package to FProxy's
passthroughMimeTypes. This will be in fproxyrc (prior to 0.3.8.1)
or you can find it in freenetrc under
services.fproxy.passthroughMimeTypes.</p><p>Next, go to a Debian mirror and download (from the directory
/debian/dists/stable/main/binary-&lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>your-arch</em></span>&gt;/,
replacing &lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>your-arch</em></span>&gt; as necessary)
Packages, Packages.gz and Release. Insert all of these (see below).
Now download the &ldquo;hello&rdquo; package from the devel directory on the
Debian mirror and insert that too, being sure to place it under
exactly the same name. Now you should be able to run
<b  >apt-get update</b> (which will download the Packages
file off your node) and then <b  >apt-get install
hello</b>, which will download and install the GNU Hello
program. If it worked, congratulations! You can now get packages
off Freenet.</p><p>To insert these packages, first you will need to create an
SVK key pair. This allows you to insert into a subspace that only
someone with the private key can access. To do this, enter</p><pre     class="programlisting">
freenet_insert -makeKeypair &amp;&gt; keypair.svk
</pre><p>Now, open up keypair.svk in your favorite text editor and
delete everything except the value of the private key, and save the
result into prv.svk. You now can insert with:
<pre     class="programlisting">
freenet_insert -serverAddress 127.0.0.1:&lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>port</em></span>&gt;
SSK@`cat prv.svk`/&lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>dir</em></span>&gt;/&lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span>&gt;
&lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span>&gt;
</pre>


replacing &lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>port</em></span>&gt; with the port number
your Freenet node is running on, &lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>dir</em></span>&gt;
with the &ldquo;directory&rdquo; (Freenet doesn't really have directories,
but we can pretend it does) that you want to insert under and
&lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span>&gt; with the name of the file.
You can retrieve the document by going back into keypair.svk,
deleting everything except the value of the public key and saving
it under pub.svk. Then type
<pre     class="programlisting">
freenet_insert -serverAddress 127.0.0.1:&lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>port</em></span>&gt;
SSK@`cat
pub.svk`/&lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>dir</em></span>&gt;&lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span>&gt; &lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span>&gt;
</pre>


replacing things as described above. You can allow others to access
these files by sending them the public key.
</p><p>This method avoids a problem that arises with a simpler,
guessable key type called KSK, which is actually a subspace where
the private key is publicly known. The problem is, there is no way
of knowing if a KSK actually has the data it's supposed to. Thus,
it can be replaced by an attacker inserting a different document at
a hops-to-live value of 1 and cutting the link before the
transmission to the next node is done. Doing this enough times will
replace the document completely for the majority of Freenet. This
means that it would be easy to replace, say, the libc6 package with
a virus. Think about how packages generally have to be installed
from root, and you see what kind of damage this could do. Even with
a subspace, it is strongly suggested that you check the MD5 sums of
the packages you're downloading.</p><p>The Everything Over Freenet (EOF) Project keeps a list of
currently maintained distributions that are under subspaces, which
cannot be taken over without knowing the private key associated.
Subspaces are slightly more complicated to use but infinitely
safer. Please see
<a href="http://eof.sourceforge.net/APT" target="_self">eof.sourceforge.net/APT</a>
for instructions on this.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea5580.0x1f9e580"></a>What Else Is There?</h2></div></div><p>So you can get Debian packages off Freenet. Big deal. You
could have done this with the FTP or HTTP servers you had been
using all along. Not only that, but now you have to worry about
packages dropping out of the store just because they aren't popular
enough.</p><p>Well, it is a big deal. The huge list of mirrors that are a
pain to keep maintained are now largely unnecessary, replaced by
automatic updating within Freenet. This relieves a lot of bandwidth
congestion.</p><p>Still, how do we keep packages from falling out? On a healthy
Freenet, a file would have to be very unpopular to ever fall out.
Needless to say, the current Freenet isn't so healthy (although
having a few thousand <span   class="emphasis"><em>&uuml;ber</em></span>-stable Debian
boxen might help). However, we need a way to ensure that
little-known but oh-so-needed packages will remain
available.</p><p>One suggestion is to create a wrapper script around Apt-get.
This will first invoke <b  >apt-get install
&lt;<i><tt>package</tt></i>&gt;</b> through a
Freenet request. If the package is unavailable, it will
automatically download it from an FTP or HTTP mirror, e-mail the
Freenet maintainer for your particular Debian distribution
(provided you have mail set up properly on your machine) and warn
them the package has dropped out of Freenet. Then it actually will
install the package it downloaded.</p><p>But that won't work. You would have to know the private key
of the subspace for it to be of any use to anybody except you. On
the other hand, documents in a subspace are almost always going to
be redirects to a CHK (a key where the name is a hash of the data,
so the same data will result in the same CHK name). If the redirect
still exists but the data under the CHK has fallen out, you could
re-insert the CHK. However, the best we can hope for if the
redirect document fell out is to e-mail the maintainer to ask them
to re-insert.</p><p>Moving along to other thoughts, we come to the problem of the
unstable distribution, which provides a unique challenge to
Freenet. Current versions provide no real means to update content.
This does not work well with the fast-moving Debian unstable. A
hack of using date- and version-based redirects actually was put
into Freenet in response to the problem of keeping Debian unstable
the same in Freenet and FTP servers. Even so, this still takes a
lot of bandwidth to accomplish.</p><p>The concept of date-based updating (putting the date in the
name of the key and re-inserting every day) was brought up,
specifically due to the question of how to update Debian packages.
My personal feelings are that date-based updating is fine for
relatively small web sites, but it's too much for the number of
files being put into an entire Debian distro. Others may
disagree.</p><p>In any case, those FTP or HTTP mirrors still will be needed
to some extent. However, most of the mirrors are now unnecessary as
most of the bandwidth can be distributed efficiently by
Freenet.</p><p>Also note that many new means to make Freenet more efficient
are being placed in the upcoming 0.4 version of Freenet. The 0.3
version was broken in some fundamental ways, making only the most
popular files easily available. With any luck, we should see more
files survive in version 0.4 of the network, which may very well be
available by the time you read this.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea5580.0x1f9ea50"></a>Help Us Mirror</h2></div></div><p>One great way to help the Freenet and Debian projects is to
help us mirror the Debian packages in Freenet. Scripts are
available to aid in this; we just need people with a lot of
bandwidth to help.</p><p>Basic requirements for helping the mirroring effort are that
you have a Freenet node running and are willing to use a lot of
bandwidth all at once. These are preferable so your ISP won't come
knocking because you blew up a T3 trying to insert all this stuff.
This isn't something to do casually; the current Debian 2.2r2 main
archive for i386 weighs in around 2GB. The non-US version is quite
a bit smaller, so if you don't live in the US and don't have much
bandwidth, this might be a good option for you.</p><p>Complete information on helping mirror Debian packages can be
found on
<a href="http://eof.sourceforge.net/APT" target="_self">eof.sourceforge.net/APT</a>.
There you will find the script for mirroring and a list of what
distributions need to be mirrored.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea5580.0x1f9ec60"></a>Freenet Is for Music Pirates and
