years back. He said the new search engine, then in public beta, was
going to kick butt because they were building it on Linux servers.
I didn't believe him. At the time my preferred search engine was
HotBot, which consistently outperformed all the other search
engines at what I cared about most: finding documents based on text
strings, some of them buried deep in a page's text. HotBot recently
had supplanted AltaVista as my first-choice search engine. Before
AltaVista I liked InfoSeek (I was one of those few who actually
subscribed to InfoSeek's services). And before that I liked Lycos,
which was still an academic project at Carnegie-Mellon. Eventually
HotBot lost out to FAST, the BSD-based engine with an utterly
mismatched URL:
<a href="http://alltheweb.com" target="_self">alltheweb.com</a>. But
resistance was futile. Google got me.</p><p>At first I didn't like Google because it was too simple and
too insistent about knowing what I wanted. I hated that. Still do.
But I came to love Google, because dammit, they did seem to know
what I wanted&mdash;not always, but often enough. Now, like most of us,
I hardly use anything else.</p><p>Today the other engines are also-rans. With each new step
forward in functionality (image and newsgroup searches, file-type
searches, additional languages), Google seems to leave the others
farther and farther behind.</p><p>I hadn't spoken to the Google folks in a while, so thought
I'd check in and get some specifics, including the answer to the
most existential question of all: are they making money yet? So I
went to my old neighbor Cindy McCaffrey, Google's vice president of
marketing, who told me:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We're profitable. Advertising has been a big
contributor to that profitability. Both of our ad programs (Premium
Sponsorships, AdWords) are ramping up quickly. We have thousands of
advertisers and have just begun expanding our advertising
internationally with the opening of small ad sales offices in the
UK, Japan and Germany.</p></blockquote></div><p>This was particularly interesting to me because the ads are a
lot like newspaper classifieds, which are the only form of
advertising for which there is high reader demand. Like
classifieds, ads on Google are unobtrusive and contain no graphics.
When I asked one advertiser how well the ads work, he said, &ldquo;Very
well. All our advertising is on Google.&rdquo; In fact, they work so
well that he advertises in spite of his objection to Google's
policy of seeking patents for its technologies, a practice he
despises. Cindy added:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The keyword-targeted approach is working well for
us. Our click-through rates average about 2+ percent, about four to
five times higher than the industry average for traditional banner
ads. We also offer search services to other companies such as
Yahoo!, Cisco, Sony, etc.&mdash;about 130 customers in about 30
countries. The split between these two revenue sources is roughly
50/50.</p></blockquote></div>

I asked if the company's mission had changed at all. My guess was
that it hadn't, since it never succumbed to the distractions that
trivialized vanquished competitors: stock prices, sports scores,
cross-promotions with entertainment sites, etc. She said no, their
mission is what it's always been: &ldquo;To organize the world's
information, making it universally accessible and useful.&rdquo;
</p><p>It might not be a stretch to say that Google has, for many of
us, become part of the web's infrastructure&mdash;its search interface.
To get some sense of how far that interface reaches, I asked Cindy
to send me some numbers. Here they are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>data centers: 4</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Linux computers: &gt;10,000</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>searches per day: &gt;150 million</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>index of web pages: &gt;1.6 billion</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>image base: &gt;330 million</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Usenet messages: &gt;650 million</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>newsgroups: &gt;5,000</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>language subsets in the index: 28</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>international domain sites: 23</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>PDFs: &gt;22 million</p></li></ul></div><p>Many of those are &ldquo;most on the Web&rdquo;, she modestly added.
But she declined to confirm the hypothesis offered by that geek who
turned me on to Google in the first place: that Linux was the
reason. Guess we have to draw our own conclusions.</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x142e580.0x1527898"></a><i  >LJ</i> Index&mdash;February

FTC Offers Hope</h2></div></div><p>In the last few days (as we go to press in mid-December
2001), the cause of free speech, which has been dear to the heart
of the Linux community&mdash;and without which we might not have either
Linux or the Internet&mdash;has taken a couple of heavy hits in the
courts. The only ray of hope comes from the FTC.</p><p>In both court cases the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright
Act) prevailed. The DMCA, which was signed into law in October
1998, expands the scope of copyright to criminalize circumvention
of copyright schemes, among other things.</p><p>In Felten vs. RIAA, Professor Edward Felten (currently on
leave from Stanford) and others sued the Recording Industry
Association of America, claiming that the RIAA used threats of
lawsuits to prevent him from presenting his work at an academic
conference. Felten had planned to show how he and his researchers
had disabled digital watermarks but backed down after a threatening
letter from an RIAA lawyer. RIAA officials later said they had not
intended to sue. The case was dismissed by US District Court Judge
Garrett E. Brown, who found that Felten had no legal
complaint.</p><p>Context: Dmitry Sklyarov, a Russian academic was imprisoned
and is still awaiting trial for DMCA violations he allegedly
committed when he gave a presentation at a conference where he
detailed weaknesses in Adobe's eBook technology software. At the
behest of Adobe, Sklyarov was arrested in his hotel in Las Vegas on
July 16, 2001 while preparing to return to Russia. He spent three
weeks in jail and still awaits trial, even though Adobe has
withdrawn its support for the case.</p><p>In a statement, Cary Sherman, senior executive vice president
with the RIAA, said:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We are happy that the court recognized what we
have been saying all along: there is no dispute here. As we have
said time and again, Professor Felten is free to publish his
findings.</p></blockquote></div><p>In a press release following the dismissal, Electronic
Frontier Foundation (EFF) Legal Director Cindy Cohn said:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Since the government and industry cannot agree on
what the DMCA means, it is not surprising that scientists and
researchers are confused and decide not to publish research for
fear of prosecution under the DMCA....Regardless of specific
government or industry threats in the past, scientists should not
have to experience the ongoing chilling effects of this vague
digital copyright law.</p></blockquote></div>

In Universal vs. Reimerdes, the 2nd US Court of Appeals affirmed a
district court ruling against the defendants. The plaintiffs
included Universal Studios, plus Tri-Star, Disney, 20th Century
Fox, Paramount, Columbia Pictures and MGM. The defendants were Eric
Corley and <span   class="emphasis"><em>2600</em></span> magazine, which had published
DeCSS, a DVD decryption program that has circulated widely on the
Net (<span   class="emphasis"><em>2600</em></span> provided a download) and that allows
users of Linux computers to watch DVDs. Corley's attorneys argued
that DeCSS was protected as free speech. The studios argued that
harm to their industry outweighed free speech protections. The
court agreed with the plaintiffs. The EFF's Cindy Cohn, who helped
represent Corley in the case, said, &ldquo;I think it's a setback for
free speech. It appears that the court is upholding censorship of
the magazine on-line.&rdquo;
</p><p>It is also significant that the DMCA, in the words of Eric S.
Raymond of the Open Source Initiative, serves to &ldquo;protect the
cartelization&rdquo; of playback devices. Jon Johansen and MoRE (Masters
of Reverse Engineering) in Norway developed DeCSS basically so DVDs
could be played back on Linux devices&mdash;something the movie studios
and their partners in the consumer electronics business hadn't
bothered to deliver.</p><p>On one positive note, the US Federal Trade Commission
announced hearings on &ldquo;Competition and Intellectual Property Law
and Policy in the Knowledge-Based Economy&rdquo;, starting in January
2002 (when this issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> should
be hitting the streets). You can learn more about it and submit

fewer features, until, one day, it's down to its core, the bare few
features that make it a killer app.</p><p>&mdash;Brent Simmons</p><p>We've recently...found that Linux&mdash;if you look at the overall
cost of ownership including the hardware, software, staffing, and
purchasing and retirement costs&mdash;ends up being significantly less
expensive than UNIX over a three-year period for things like web
serving.</p><p>&mdash;Dan Kusnetzky, International Data Corp. (IDC)</p><p>A teacher who establishes rapport with the taught becomes one
with them, learns more from them than he teaches them. He who
learns nothing from his disciples is, in my opinion, worthless.
Whenever I talk with someone I learn from him. I take from him more
than I give him. In this way, a true teacher regards himself as a
student of his students. If you will teach your pupils with this
attitude, you will benefit much from them.</p><p>&mdash;M. K. Ghandi</p><p>He had the startling individuality of a man who had never

tide of big money contributed by a narrow, unrepresentative elite

organizations or their competitors knowing what they're running.
They'd rather get kudos for a job well done than criticism for how
they got the job done.</p><p>&mdash;Dan Kusnetzky, International Data Corp. (IDC)</p></div></div>
