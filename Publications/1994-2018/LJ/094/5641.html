the right thing to do.</p><p>by Richard Vernon</p><p>The idea of the small and/or home office is one that is
receiving an increasing amount of attention. As technology and the
multiple demands on our time make working from home a better
option, the home office is something of which we are seeing more.
And, as many once medium-sized businesses have shrunk with the
current economy, the small office is becoming a more frequent
element in the business landscape.</p><p>A principal attraction of the home office is avoiding a long
commute. My own commute involves riding a bicycle seven and a half
miles in the Seattle rain (though I must confess that it's only
slightly uphill in one, not both, directions) and an hour ride on a
ferryboat each way. I always thought in my narrow-minded way that
the advantages of working from home were limited to the personal
luxury of working in my socks and underwear and saving the commute
time. But of course I was missing the big picture. Last month we
ran an interview that our publisher, Phil Hughes, did with Costa
Rica's Minister of Science and Technology Guy F. de
T&eacute;ramond. T&eacute;ramond is a key figure in bringing
universal internet connectivity to Costa Rica. He mentions that
part of his motivation for this project was to allow more Costa
Ricans the opportunity to telecommute, not only for improved
quality of life, but because the increasing population in urban
centers was placing too great a stress on the transportation
infrastructure. An increase in telecommuters should lighten that
load. Living in the Seattle area, which has one of the worst
traffic problems in the world, I now work from home when I can, not
for selfish reasons, but because hey&mdash;I'm just doin' my part to
make the world a better place.</p><p>Our two feature articles this month should be appealing to
anyone who uses Linux to work from home. If Don Marti's prediction
that used laptop computers will be down to eight dollars by the
time you read this, then maybe I can set up the wireless home
network he describes in his article. Being as I share my current
&ldquo;home office&rdquo; with the furnace and lovely asbestos wall hangings
because any other room is too inconvenient a distance from my
wife's computer for our collection of cat 5 cables, this would be a
real benefit.</p><p>Rory Krause's article on printing documents located on a
remote office system at home using ssh's port-forwarding feature
eliminates yet another reason for not working from home. With the
script included in Rory's article, you can print remote documents
without having to use scp or print to a file.</p><p>Between the instructional content in both articles, you
should be able make some substantial improvements to your small
office and/or reap the benefits of working in your socks and
underwear while saving the environment.</p></div></div>
