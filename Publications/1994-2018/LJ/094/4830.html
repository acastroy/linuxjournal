Linking against large 3-D libraties increases compilation time.
Because a lot of fine tuning is often necessary for everything to
look perfect, stretches of minor changes buried between long builds
are commonly encountered. These lengthy debug cycles make 3-D
graphics an ideal application for prototyping in a high-level
language like Python.
</p><p>Extensions to a number of 3-D graphics APIs are available for
Python. For IRIX systems, the Python distribution comes with a
module providing access to the SGI IRIS GL library. Python programs
can make use of the Java3D API from inside JPython, an
implementation of Python that runs inside a Java Virtual Machine.
This article focuses on the OpenGL library because of its
widespread use and excellent support for Linux and Python.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c46580.0x1d3e768"></a>Downloading and Installing PyOpenGL</h2></div></div><p>PyOpenGL is a suite of Python modules that provides access to
OpenGL as well as an assortment of helper utilities and extensions
to complement OpenGL's low-level interface. It was originally
created by James Hugunin, Thomas Schwaller and David Ascher. Tarn
Burton recently has taken over as lead developer, and Rene
Liebscher and Michael Fletcher also maintain the package.</p><p>Since OpenGL wrappers make up the bulk of PyOpenGL's
functionality, you will need a basic understanding of OpenGL to
write programs with it. There are many excellent tutorials and
references available on OpenGL, see Resources for a list of
recommendations.</p><p>The first requirement for PyOpenGL is OpenGL itself. If you
don't have an OpenGL implementation installed already, check your
GNU/Linux distribution to see if it includes the packages, or
download the Mesa 3-D graphics library from
<a href="http://www.mesa.org" target="_self">www.mesa.org</a>. For PyOpenGL
to work at full capacity, the module Numerical Python must be
installed. Sources for Numeric and PyOpenGL can be found at
<a href="http://numpy.sourceforge.net" target="_self">numpy.sourceforge.net</a>
and
<a href="http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net" target="_self">pyopengl.sourceforge.net</a>,
respectively. Compilation and installation is easy thanks to Greg
Ward's distutils module, which is included in Python as of version
1.6. Running the command <b  >python setup.py install</b>
from inside the unpacked source directories should build and
install the modules. Before installing from source, you may want to
check if your GNU/Linux distribution already provides these
modules. They were included as part of my Debian distribution.
Note: the version I worked with is PyOpenGL 1.5.7, since the time
of this writing, version 2.0 has become available.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c46580.0x1d3ea80"></a>A Simple Python OpenGL Application</h2></div></div><p>The OpenGL specification does not define specifications for
interaction with windowing systems. Consequently, programs using
OpenGL must use an external GUI toolkit. The program in Listing 1
uses GLUT, a cross-platform windowing toolkit for OpenGL. Unless
you are using a commercial OpenGL implementation, you probably
already have GLUT installed.</p><p><a href="4830l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Opening a Window, Setting
up Lighting and Drawing a Teapot with GLUT</a></p><p>This code opens a window, sets up lighting and draws a
teapot. Aside from the added syntactic compactness Python affords,
it looks much like the equivalent program written in C. One minor
difference is how the display function callback is set. Setting the
display function callback in C or C++ would only require calling
the function glutDisplayFunc(display). Setting the callback in
PyOpenGL is done in two steps: invoking glutSetDisplayFunc() and
then glutDisplayFunc(). This idiosyncrasy also applies for setting
other callbacks such as glutMouseFunc() and
glutReshapeFunc().</p><p>While GLUT is suitable for most small OpenGL applications, it
still requires a fair amount of work to implement functionality
that is often desirable when testing, such as mouse control for
zooming, panning and rotation. Togl is a Tkinter widget that
automatically provides these features as well as default lighting.
Listing 2 shows the same program using Togl.</p><p><a href="4830l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Same Program Using
Togl</a></p><p>Notice it uses considerably less code but provides much more
functionality. The cost of this is flexibility. If Togl's default
lighting and user interface don't meet your requirements, you will
need to re-implement them yourself. Togl is excellent for
prototyping, as it eliminates the need to write and debug
boilerplate lighting and navigation code.</p><p>PyOpenGL also integrates well with other GUI toolkits that
have 3-D widgets. Bindings exist for wxWindows, FLTK, FOX and
GTK.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c46580.0x1d3ee48"></a>Using Texture Maps</h2></div></div><p>Texturing mapping is the technique of taking image data, like
a photograph, and &ldquo;gluing&rdquo; it to a polygon. Using textures
requires converting the external texture images into one of the
low-level internal formats supported by OpenGL. While the code
required for setting textures in Python does not differ much from
normal OpenGL code, Python does simplify the process of loading and
manipulating texture image files.</p><p>The Python standard library includes rgbimg, a module for
reading SGI imglib(.rgb) files. While this may seem like an obscure
format, its simplicity allows its inclusion in Python's standard
library without causing too much bloat. Using the GIMP or
ImageMagick, you can convert images from formats like PNG, JPEG or
TIFF to SGI imglib. The command
<b  >rgbimg.longimagedata(<i><tt>file</tt></i>)</b>
will read and decode the specified SGI imglib formatted file and
return it as a binary string of four-byte RGBA pixels. This data
can be passed to OpenGL functions like glTexImage2D, using the
format parameter GL_RGBA and the data type GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE.</p><p>Another useful module in the Python standard library is
imageop. This module includes functions for cropping, scaling and
grayscale conversions for images. The imageop functions operate on
data in the same GL_RGBA/GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE format as the data
returned from rgbimg.longimagedata().</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c46580.0x1d3f0b0"></a>PyOpenGL Utility Functions</h2></div></div><p>In addition to wrapping the core libraries and toolkits,
PyOpenGL also includes a number of utility functions to perform
high-level tasks. Have you ever wanted to grab a still image of an
OpenGL scene? You always can use programs that support screen
capture, such as xv or The GIMP, but what if you want to grab a
still at a specific point in time? Taking screenshots manually
won't work if the program needs to run without user control, like a
CGI script. You also can't grab a dozen stills a second manually to
create a movie. PyOpenGL has a couple helper functions for
automatically grabbing scene shots in various formats.</p><p>Listing 3 is an adaptation of the previous program that saves
a PostScript image of the scene to disk, then exits. You can take a
look at the image that was saved in Figure 1.</p><p><a href="4830l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Saving a PostScript
Image, Then Exiting</a></p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4830f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Results from Listing 3
</p></div></div><p>The scene is saved using the command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
openglutil.glSaveEPS('ex3.eps', 240, 240)
</pre><p>The first argument is the name of the file to save to. The
second is the width in pixels to capture, and the third is the
height. Using the same syntax with the glSavePPM() command will
save an image of the scene in the portable pixmap file format.
Additionally, if you have compiled PyOpenGL with TIFF support, the
command glSaveTIFF() is available for saving scene shots in the
TIFF format.
</p><p>PyOpenGL also provides a convenience wrapper for OpenGL's
object selection or &ldquo;picking&rdquo; mechanism. The selection mode of
operation in OpenGL automatically tells you which objects fall
within a given region of the view screen. This means you can pass
the selection mechanism to a point on the screen where a mouse
click occurred, and it will tell you what object was clicked
on.</p><p>Here are the basic steps for setting up the selection
mechanism in PyOpenGL:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Write a method or function that draws each object
in the scene wrapped in between a call to glPushName() and
glPopName(). Pass a different integer as an argument to
glPushName() for each independent object in the scene. OpenGL will
use this value to indicate which objects were selected.</p></li><li><p>Set up the event handler for mouse clicks. The way
this works depends on the toolkit you are using. In Tkinter,
mouse-click event handlers are set up by passing a method or
function reference to the bind() method.</p></li><li><p>Once a mouse click has occurred, pass the mouse x
and y coordinates, along with a reference to the method or function
created in part one, to the function
OpenGL.GL.glSelectWithCallback(). This function will return a list
of tuples of the form (near, far, names) where near and far
represent integer depth values, and names is a tuple of the names
passed in glPushName() for the selected objects. If no objects were
selected, an empty tuple is returned.</p></li></ol></div><p>Listing 4 demonstrates use of the selection mechanism in
PyOpenGL. This demo draws a cube and a sphere on the screen.
Experiment with holding down the Ctrl key and pressing the left
mouse button with the pointer in different places.

A 3DStudio Model Rendered Using PyOpenGL
</p></div></div><p>The selection mechanism is the simplest way to perform this
task, but it is by no means the only way. Another technique is to
render the objects to a back buffer that OpenGL does not send to an
output device. To do this, render each object using a different
color. Once done, the back buffer should contain the 2-D rendering
of the scene. By examining the color at a particular point you can
determine which object was drawn in that region of the screen. This
back buffer is called the feedback buffer in OpenGL.</p><p>Yet another method for object picking is to do the
intersection testing by hand. This means you would have to project
a ray from the view screen and test each object in the scene for
intersection. Once you have found a list of intersected objects,
you then must sort by depth values to see which was closest to the
view screen. While this may offer more control over the process, it
is an arduous task and is difficult to do efficiently in
Python.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c46580.0x1d369c0"></a>Improving Performance</h2></div></div><p>Now that you have seen how to write simple OpenGL programs,
you are probably wondering if Python can scale up to the demands of
more advanced 3-D applications. While the performance of a PyOpenGL
program generally lags behind that of its C or C++ counterpart,
optimization techniques can narrow the gap considerably.</p><p>The main strategy in improving execution speed is to reduce
the amount of time spent within the Python interpreter by moving
expensive operations into native code. One means of accomplishing
this is to rewrite sluggish parts of the program in a fast,
natively compiled language like C or C++. Implementing these
compiled portions of the program as Python extension modules allows
the remaining interpreted Python code to access their
functionality. While this approach certainly has potential for
speeding things up, it lacks the simplicity of a pure Python
solution. It also requires you understand how to write Python
extension modules in a language that compiles to native code.
Besides, if you wanted to do it in C, you wouldn't have started
messing around with Python in the first place!</p><p>OpenGL display lists provide a way to move operations into
native code without any of the headaches associated with the former
approach of writing extension modules. Display lists allow OpenGL
programs to cache a set of commands further down in the rendering
pipeline. In some environments, OpenGL even can store display lists
on the graphics card itself, far away from the bottleneck of the
Python interpreter.</p><p>The glGenLists() command creates an array of empty display
lists. It takes a single integer argument, the number of display
lists, to generate. It returns the number of lists that were
successfully created. Wrapping a set of OpenGL operations with the
commands glNewList() and glEndList() fills a specified display
list. Once stored, subsequent invocations of that set of operations
requires only a single command, glCallList(). The syntax for using
display lists in PyOpenGL is pretty much the same as in OpenGL with
C.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c46580.0x1d36bd0"></a>Next Steps</h2></div></div><p>We have just begun to scratch the surface of OpenGL
