wrong&mdash;Doc reflects on the backlash against Linux in the
press.</p><p>by Doc Searls</p><p>On my browser is a CNET piece titled, &ldquo;Got Linux? Many
Companies Say No&rdquo;, by Sergio G. Non. The subhead reads, &ldquo;News
Analysis: Linux penguins are braying louder, but companies don't
plan to adopt many of them in the near future.&rdquo; The opening text
paints fact as speculation, then shoots it down: &ldquo;...because the
economy is still weak, many tech observers believe that Linux&mdash;and
its price tag of 'free'--will attract more businesses looking to
cut costs. At least that's the theory. Practice indicates something
else.&rdquo;</p><p>The &ldquo;practice&rdquo;, however, is anything but. It's a Goldman
Sachs survey of 100 technology executives who were asked to name
their highest and lowest spending priorities. Top priorities were
migrating to new versions of Windows, security software and UNIX
servers. At the bottom were mainframes, supply-chain management
software and Linux servers. Again, these were spending priorities.
No practice involved. Also no respect for the virtues of Linux as
an instrument of savings.</p><p>We finally run into actual practice about halfway through the
piece, when the author reports that Amazon.com has just &ldquo;saved
millions by switching to Linux from UNIX in many areas of its
business&rdquo;. Then we read quotations from an IT consultant who says,
&ldquo;Many of our clients consider Linux to be a very real option for
cost savings&rdquo;, and &ldquo;There's a definite ROI.&rdquo; The same consultant
later adds, &ldquo;I would agree that many companies are scaling back
forward-looking projects.... However, the feedback we get from our
clients is that they are very interested in Linux.&rdquo;</p><p>In fact, the weight of evidence in the piece actually favors
Linux, on the whole. But that's not the story this CNET writer
wanted to tell. There's a backlash against Linux right now in the
business press, and this guy was just doing his part. To be fair,
there's a backlash against everything associated with the dot-com
bubble, from venture capitalists and day traders to the countless
wacky ideas that attracted hugely speculative investments.</p><p>But I think the backlash hits Linux worse for a number of
reasons. One reason is that there aren't many pure Linux companies
left. The Business Tux population has thinned to the point where it
looks like an endangered species, even while a lot of big companies
like IBM are crooning their love for Linux.</p><p>Last week I purged my collection of business cards collected
over the last several years, and all but a few of them went in the
trash. The ones I tossed were mostly from companies that are now
dead, absorbed into other companies or busy repositioning
themselves as something else.</p><p>And another problem was the brief but spectacular moment
Linux had in the spotlight on Wall Street, a spotlight that fell on
Tux at the very peak of the Street's speculative fever. In late
1999, no fleece was more golden than Linux, even though very few
investors knew what Linux did, other than appear to threaten
Microsoft. Between August and December of 1999, Red Hat, Cobalt,
Andover and VA Linux all had huge IPO successes. VA's debut run-up
was the biggest in Wall Street history.</p><p>Today, the only one of those four companies that still
proudly flies the Linux flag is Red Hat&mdash;and I say hats off to
them. Cobalt was acquired by Sun. Andover was acquired by VA, which
recently filed to change its name to VA Software; they've even rid
its stock of the once-valuable LNUX name.</p><p>The larger problem was that too many dot-com companies were
not companies at all. They were projects&mdash;ventures. They were like
those businesses with false fronts that lined the streets of mining
towns built overnight in the Old West and abandoned almost as fast
when the lode ran out, if it was ever there in the first place.
From the street they looked like real businesses in real towns, but
in fact, everything in sight was a gamble.</p><p>But Linux isn't a gamble, not as a technology. But it also
isn't a business&mdash;and that brings us to our third problem, which is
trying to understand and explain it to real businesses. The Goldman
Sachs study cited by that CNET article typifies the problem. Linux
in its pure state isn't for sale. You can't look at its popularity
in terms of sales.</p><p>Worse, prognostications have ways of flat-out sucking anyway.
Yesterday I went through boxes in the garage looking for a document
I've been saving for a dozen years because it was so spectacularly
wrong, right from the minute it was printed. I couldn't find it,
even though it was thick as a phone book and chock-full of evidence
for the continued growth of OS/2, Novell and other brand-name LANs,
the likely success of AT&amp;T in the computer business, the
continued growth and proliferation of a dozen different UNIX
brands, especially AT&amp;T's original UNIX, recently bought by
Novell and rebranded as UnixWare, a lot of stuff about Lotus Notes,
and the continuing share losses for Apple. There was nothing, of
course, about the Internet, and nothing about Linux. There was no
idea that a PC would ever be hooked up to anything more significant
than a printer and a fileserver.</p><p>But I did find some wonderful other nuggets. A
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Sports Illustrated</em></span> from November 30, 1981, had
a cover story on the preseason, number one North Carolina Tar
Heels, with four of the team's stars: James Worthy, Matt Doherty,
Jimmy Black and Sam Perkins. Not shown is the player that would
emerge not only as the team's biggest star, but the best player in
the history of the sport: Michael Jordan. And there was a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Popular Electronics</em></span> from July 1976.
&ldquo;Exclusive! Now You Can Build a High-Quality Intelligent
Terminal!&rdquo; it says. I page through it. There are a lot of ads for
CB radios and stereo gear, electronics courses and antennas. But
near the front is a two-page spread, the headline of which reads,
&ldquo;Imagine a Microcomputer&rdquo;. Below is a box with LEDs and switches
on the outside and an inside that's all backplane and power supply.
The copy went on:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Imagine a microcomputer with all the design
savvy, ruggedness and sophistication of the best minicomputers.
</p><p>Imagine a microcomputer supported by dozens of interface,
memory and processor option boards. One that can be interfaced to
an indefinite number of peripheral devices....</p></blockquote></div><p>It was an ad for the MITS Altair 8800-b. It didn't succeed,
but the vision sounds mighty familiar, doesn't it?
