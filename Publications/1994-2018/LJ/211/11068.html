This article should acquaint you with basic Arduino programming
and show you how to write programs that interact with objects in the real world. (A
mandatory disclaimer: the last time I really studied
electronics was way back in high school, so this article focuses more on the
programming aspects, rather than the electronic side of things.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x174b580.0x1843460"></a>
Physical Computing</h2></div></div><p>
Before I start talking about this really cool thing called Arduino
(Italian for &ldquo;good friend&rdquo;), let me say a few things about the
fascinating subject of physical computing. Physical computing has been
defined in various ways, but the central idea seems
to be the same: physical computing is concerned with developing
software that interacts with the world beyond the host computer through
a combination of hardware and software&mdash;it's aware of the world, so to
speak. Such awareness makes these applications capable of sensing
external events and responding to them in a predefined way. This is
accomplished by the use of sensors and actuators (which I describe next).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x174b580.0x18435c0"></a>
Actuators and Sensors</h2></div></div><p>
The Arduino interacts with the world through actuators and sensors.
Sensors are electronic components that describe the world to
your application. One common way sensors work is that their
electrical properties change (in a mathematically known way) as an effect
of the changes in the conditions in which it's operating. For example,
the resistance of a photo-resistor changes when the intensity of light
incident on it changes. Thermistors are another example of such sensors
whose resistance changes when the operating temperature changes. A flex
sensor is a different category of sensor, where the resistance changes
depending on the extent of the flex or &ldquo;bend&rdquo;. Such changes can be
read as electrical signals on the Arduino's input pin. Depending on
the kind of sensor, the signal either can be digital (on or off)
or analog (a continuous stream of values). The latter part of this article
shows how to work
with analog sensors.
</p><p>
Actuators, on the other hand, are electronic components that are used to
react to an external event. For example, when it gets dark, the light
should be switched on. Sensors and actuators, thus, are used to achieve
complementary objectives: one senses, and the other reacts. Examples of
actuators are solenoids and servos. Later in this article, I explain how to
control a servo using Arduino.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x174b580.0x1843778"></a>
Arduino</h2></div></div><p>
The Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform composed
of two major parts: the Arduino board (hardware) and the Arduino IDE
(software). The Arduino IDE is used to write the program that will
interact with your Arduino and the devices connected to it. In the
Arduino world, such a program is called a sketch, which has its origin
in its mother language, Processing (see Resources).
</p><p>
The Arduino board is a small-form microcontroller circuit board. At the
time of this writing,
a number of Arduino boards exist: Arduino UNO, Nano, Mega, Mini,
Pro and others (see Resources for a complete list). The Arduino UNO (Figure
1) is the latest version of the basic Arduino board, and you need one
of these to follow this article (see Resources for the UNO's detailed
specifications).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11068f1.large.jpg"><img src="11068f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Arduino UNO (Courtesy of
<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno" target="_self">arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno</a>)
</p></div></div><p>
Besides the UNO, you need the following hardware to work
through this article:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Breadboard to set up the circuit.
</p></li><li><p>
Some LEDs.
</p></li><li><p>
Resistors: 330 Ohm (at least as many as LEDs), 10 kOhm resistors.
</p></li><li><p>
Continuous rotation servo (SpringRC SM-S4303R continuous rotation servo:
<a href="http://www.robotgear.com.au/Product.aspx/Details/482" target="_self">www.robotgear.com.au/Product.aspx/Details/482</a>).
</p></li><li><p>
Flex sensor.
</p></li><li><p>
Linear potentiometer.
</p></li><li><p>
Connecting wires.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
One excellent way to get started with Arduino is the Arduino starter kit
from Sparkfun. This starter kit contains all the hardware and more
that you need to follow this article (except the servo).
</p><p>
If you haven't already opened up your Arduino and plugged it in to your USB
port, plug it in. For the purposes of this article, it will be sufficient to
use the power supply via the USB connection. If you connect more devices,
you will need to connect an external supply.
</p><p>
You will program the Arduino in a language that looks very similar to C
and is based on Processing. You can download the Arduino IDE from the
Arduino Project Web site.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x174b580.0x1844220"></a>
Arduino IDE</h2></div></div><p>
As you might guess, the IDE is as always the front end. The
real pieces are the compilers, linkers and libraries that need to
be present to communicate and program the AVR microcontroller-based
Arduino. Depending on your Linux distribution, the exact names of the
packages will vary, so I just list the software by name here:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The GNU C and C++ compiler for AVR.
</p></li><li><p>
AVR binutils.
</p></li><li><p>
AVR libc.
</p></li><li><p>
avrdude (a program for uploading code to the microcontroller board).
</p></li><li><p>
rxtx (for serial communication).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Once these packages are installed, fire up your Arduino IDE. Take a
moment to explore the IDE. The buttons for compiling (verifying) and
uploading the sketch are the important ones.
</p><p>
The communication between your computer and the Arduino will be via the
USB cable that has been packaged with your Arduino board. Once you plug
the USB cable in to your computer (with the other end plugged in to the
Arduino board), it should show up in the Arduino IDE under Tools&rarr;Serial
Port as /dev/ttyACMx. If you have more than one USB serial device
communicated, be careful to select the correct one. You need to
set up user permissions correctly to access the serial port (see Resources
for distribution-specific instructions).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x174b580.0x18447a0"></a>
Blink Those LEDs</h2></div></div><p>
For the first sketch, let's blink an LED and then extend it to blink
multiple LEDs alternately. Before the software part, let's first
set up the circuit to connect the LED to the Arduino. The completed
circuit should look like Figure 2.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11068f2.large.jpg"><img src="11068f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Circuit for a Single LED Blink
</p></div></div><p>
Next, in your Arduino IDE, open the sketch in Examples&rarr;Basics&rarr;Blink, which
should look like Listing 1.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x174b580.0x1844b10"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. Simple LED Blink Sketch</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
/*
 Blink
 Turns on an LED on for one second,
 then off for one second, repeatedly.
 This example code is in the public domain.
 */

void setup() {
 // initialize the digital pin as an output.
 // Pin 13 has an LED connected on most Arduino boards:
 pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
 digitalWrite(13, HIGH);   // set the LED on
 delay(1000);              // wait for a second
 digitalWrite(13, LOW);    // set the LED off
 delay(1000);              // wait for a second
}
</pre></div><p>
As you can see from that sketch and the circuit diagram, the LED
is connected to the digital pin 13 of the Arduino. Once you verify
(compile) the sketch and upload it to the Arduino board, you should see
the blinking LED.
</p><p>
Because this is your first sketch, take some time to understand
the general framework of an Arduino sketch. If you are familiar with
C or C++, you will notice that you have two functions in this sketch:
setup() and loop(). The code that you write in setup() is meant for
initialization and is executed once the sketch is uploaded to the
board. The code in loop() is executed repeatedly as long as the power to
the Arduino is supplied. Even if you power off the Arduino and power it
back on, the sketch still resides until you overwrite it with another sketch.
An Arduino sketch should be saved in a file with the extension pde and is
stored in a directory of the same name.
</p><p>
For the next sketch, let's connect multiple LEDs and blink them
alternately to create a cool rippling effect. (You might want to connect
more than three LEDs of different colors.) The circuit for this sketch
is shown in Figure 3.

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11068f3.large.jpg"><img src="11068f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

// constants won't change. Used here to

const int numPins = 3;
const int ledPin [] =  {11,12,13};   // the number of LED pins

int interval = 100;    // interval at which to blink (milliseconds)

void setup() {
  // Iterate over each of the pins and set them as output
  for(int i=0;i&lt;numPins;i++)
    pinMode(ledPin[i], OUTPUT);
}

/* Loop until death */
void loop()
{
  for(int i=0;i&lt;numPins;i++)
  {
    digitalWrite(ledPin[i],HIGH);
    delay(interval);
    digitalWrite(ledPin[i],LOW);
    delay(interval);
  }
}

</pre></div><p>
Once you have uploaded this sketch to your Arduino UNO board,
your LEDs should put on a colorful performance.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x174b580.0x1c3d548"></a>
Analog Sensors</h2></div></div><p>
In the first sketch, you turned the LED on and off by writing to the Arduino's digital
pin. What if you wanted something in between&mdash;say, to fade on
and off? Say hello to a tiny little device called a potentiometer. To
set up the circuit, connect the central pin of the potentiometer to
the analog pin 0, and the other two pins to the +5V supply and ground,
respectively. The LED should be connected as in the first sketch.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x174b580.0x1c3d6a8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

int sensorPin = 0;
int ledPin = 13;
int sensorValue = 0;

void setup() {
     //declare the ledPin as an OUTPUT:
     pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
     Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
        sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin);//

        digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);

        delay(sensorValue);

        digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);

        delay(sensorValue);
}
</pre></div><p>
In Listing 3, you can see that the reading from the potentiometer is
used to control the delay time, so the effect of fading in and
out is produced.
</p><p>
Next, let's use an electronic component called a flex sensor
to (you guessed it) control an LED. Basically, let's use the flex
sensor in place of the potentiometer of the earlier circuit. A flex
sensor is an analog sensor whose resistance changes with its bending
angle. You will see that the resistance changes as you bend on either
side&mdash;increasing on one side and decreasing on the other. The Arduino
sketch is shown in Listing 4.

  //Use the average as a delay value
  delaytime = sensorValues/10;

  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  delay(delaytime);
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);

delay(delaytime);
}

</pre></div><p>
The flex sensor has two pins: one end should be connected to the +5V
input, and the other pin should be connected to the analog pin 0 and
farther on to the ground via a 10 kOhm resistor.

Serial Communication</h2></div></div><p>
All the sketches so far have made use of the Arduino library calls
to read and write to the Arduino pins. You haven't directly made use
of the serial communication between the host computer and the Arduino
board. First, I'll describe how to write a basic client/server
style program.
</p><p>
The &ldquo;server&rdquo; program is a sketch that lives on the Arduino board
waiting
for serial data to be available (an integer in this case) and sends back
the number by adding 1 to it to the &ldquo;client&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x174b580.0x1c3dde0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

int number;

void setup()
{
  // Open the serial connection, 9600 baud
  Serial.begin(9600);

      Serial.println(number + 1);
    }

}
</pre></div><p>
The client side of the program is written in Processing using its serial
library (Listing 6).

To run the client, download the processing IDE and create a new sketch with the
code as shown in Listing 5. Run this code after you have uploaded
the server sketch (Listing 5) to the Arduino.

Controlling a Servo</h2></div></div><p>
Now, let's make things move with your
Arduino code. For this example, let's control the movement of a servo&mdash;that
is, start and stop the servo and control its speed and rotation. 
Three wires protrude out of the servo: control (white/yellow),
power (red) and ground (black/brown). First, set up the circuit such
that the the control wire is connected to the Arduino's digital pin 2,
the red wire is connected to the Arduino's 5V input and the
black wire to the ground. Now, upload the sketch (Listing 7) to your
Arduino. You also optionally may connect an LED to the digital pin 13
(in the same way you connected a single LED earlier), which will turn
on or off depending on whether the servo is rotating.

Once the sketch is uploaded, open a serial communication channel

&ldquo;servo prompt&rdquo; at your service:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Arduino Serial Servo Control
Keys:'(s)lower' or '(f)aster', spacebar to center and o to stop
</pre>
</p><p>
Pressing the keys to the servo should produce the desired behavior. If
you see the code listing for the servo mechanism, you will see that
the key to controlling the speed is basically the duration of the delay
(variable pulseWidth) between sending a HIGH and LOW signal to the
servo. Here, we are simulating an analog behavior using
the important technique called Pulse Width Modulation, which you
can read about elsewhere.

I'm drawing toward the close of this article, and I hope you
have had a lot of fun. However, if you are like me, you already
have started wondering what's going on behind the scenes&mdash;the journey of the
processing sketch to the bytes getting executed on the Arduino board.
</p><p>
The real work behind the scenes is done by the GNU C/C++ compilers,
linkers and libraries for the AVR microcontroller. If you hold the
Shift key when you compile your sketch, you will see that the commands
<tt  >- avr-g++</tt>, <tt  >avr-g++</tt>,
<tt  >avr-ar</tt> and <tt  >avr-objcopy</tt> are invoked.
First, your Arduino
sketch is converted to a suitable C++ file (with the .cpp extension), which
then is compiled, linked and finally converted to the hex file that
is uploaded to the Arduino board. You can see all these intermediate
files in the /tmp/build*.tmp directory. Knowledge of this build process
can enable you to bypass the IDE for your Arduino development by writing
an appropriate Makefile. See the &ldquo;Command-Line Arduino development&rdquo;
article listed in Resources for an example.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I've described a few simple but cool things that can be done with
an Arduino, but this article barely scratches the surface.
A number of
excellent books are available that list a great number of Arduino projects
you can build for fun and profit. These are, of course, in addition to all the excellent on-line
resources available. During exploring Arduino purely from
the various blog posts on the Web and a trial-and-error-based approach to
learning, I discovered many great
projects in the Arduino ecosystem. Be sure to see the Resources for this article
for some of the most interesting Arduino books, articles and projects.
</p><p>
Also note that wires are good, but only when you want to limit
yourself to the confines of your tabletop or even your room. If you want your
Arduino to be out there, decoupled from your host machine, you need
to explore ways of wireless communication. Say hello to XBee modules,
which allow communication with the ZigBee communication standard.
</p><p>
And before I end, you might face issues with erratic serial communication.
Especially during extended periods of experimenting with serial communication,
I found that the serial ports would remain locked or just
be plainly not accessible from the host computer. My advice is to be patient.
Unplug and plug back in a few times, and try killing the lock file manually.
Now, you should be good
to go.
