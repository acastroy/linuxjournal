<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #211, November 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
As <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> released <span   class="bold"><b>Linux 3.0</b></span> at long last, there followed a cascade
of minor breakages related solely to the change in version number. Some of
these had to do with the kernel sources themselves; others had to do with
user scripts out in the wild. The <span   class="bold"><b>git</b></span> tree had to be renamed to
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git, because
the previous tree had &ldquo;2.6&rdquo; in the URL. Then the <span   class="bold"><b>kernel.org</b></span> page
pointed to the wrong git tree, so that had to be sorted out. 
</p><p>
The kernel build scripts also expected a three-numbered version number,
with an optional fourth (for the stable series), while the 3.0 kernel will
have only two, with an optional third. But, it turns out that there's no
easy answer, because the kernel is so used to recognizing itself as a
three-numbered entity, that it couldn't (for now) be made to identify
as 3.0 internally.
</p><p>
A related problem is that some third-party software, including some that
exists in binary form only, can't tolerate the version number change. As
<span   class="bold"><b>Andi Kleen</b></span> reported, this means that Linux
3.0 is not fully backward-compatible with Linux 2.6, even though the only cause of that
incompatibility is the version number. He posted a patch to cause the
kernel to masquerade as a 2.6 kernel, with an additional string tacked onto
the version number, indicating the proper 3.0 version. It's about as
ugly a solution as you could imagine, but Andi said that there didn't
seem to be any better workaround that would still allow the binary-only
software to run under the new kernels.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>OpenRISC architecture</b></span> will be included in the Linux kernel. OpenRISC is
a really cool hardware project for creating an open-source CPU design. The
project has gone through various vicissitudes, including being virtually
dead for a while. But, now there are about 25 developers on the project, and
they've had a kernel port in development since 2.6.35. <span   class="bold"><b>Jonas Bonn</b></span>
recently submitted that code to Linus Torvalds for inclusion, and it was
accepted readily enough, after a small moment of confusion over whether a
related patch by <span   class="bold"><b>Rusty Russell</b></span> would be cleaner to accept before or after
Jonas'.
</p><p>
Another architecture also is well on the way to being accepted into the
kernel. The <span   class="bold"><b>C64x</b></span> from <span   class="bold"><b>Texas Instruments</b></span> recently got a GCC port, which
means it's now possible to compile a full system for that chip. The GCC
port is actually in a relatively early stage, but it's still promising
enough that <span   class="bold"><b>Mark Salter</b></span> felt the time was right to post his patch
introducing the C64x architecture into the kernel. He also set up a
developer wiki at <span   class="bold"><b>linux-c6x.org</b></span>.
</p><p>
An interesting detail about the C64x processors is that they don't
support <span   class="bold"><b>cache coherency</b></span>. In other words, multiple CPU cores are not
guaranteed to see the same data when they check a given location in a
shared data store. Without cache coherency, supporting <span   class="bold"><b>SMP</b></span> (Symmetric
Multiprocessing) systems is much more difficult. For now, C64x systems may
have to remain single-processor only.

<h2 class="title">Tweak Your Android Memory Management System</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">James Coyner</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #211, November 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In my travels, I've discovered that not only does the Linux community have
a robust following, but so does the Android hacking community. My journey began
two years ago with the release of the Original Droid. I had come from a
Windows Mobile world and didn't know that phone hacking even existed. Now
hacking around on my Droid is almost an everyday task.
</p><p>
Most of you own Android phones now, and many of you already are running
hacked versions of Android, and many of you already heavily tweak your builds.
This article is not for you. It's an introduction to the world of Android
customization, intended for Android users who don't yet
know how to tweak their devices.
</p><p>
You've probably heard of Cyanogen and CVPCS if you are at all
involved in the community. They are, in fact, a couple of the most
influential developers of CyanogenMod, an open-source customized version of
Android&mdash;a distribution of sorts. With this distro, you get the kernel for
your device as well as the latest version of Android.
</p><p>
Before I begin, the most important requirement is that you are rooted. You
can find many guides on-line to do this. Once you obtain root, let's begin
with the tweaks.
</p><p>
Android comes with the Linux kernel, which, if you have not already
inferred,
means that many of the mainline kernel tweaks can be applied to the Android
version of the kernel through the use of various configuration files. For
this guide, you're going to edit build.prop, which is located under
/system, and the local.prop, which is under /data.
</p><p>
On Linux, you can edit these files with vim or nano, but Android is slightly
different. On Android, you need a file browser that is able to run and edit
files as the superuser or root. There are many root-level browsers on the
Android market, but I have been quite successful with an application called
Root Explorer, so I use that for the remainder of this
guide, but any root browser with text editor support will suffice.
</p><p>
Now that you have rooted your device and have the version of Android
installed that you want to tweak, you can begin tweaking. The first thing I
normally do is optimize my TCP stack for faster 3G download speeds. To
do this, open your file browser of choice (I used Root Explorer), navigate
to /system/build.prop or /data/local.prop, and open it in the text editor.
</p><p>
Every Android device has a build.prop file, but not all will have the
local.prop file. If the local.prop file exists, it's generally safer to
edit this file rather than the build.prop file. So edit whichever you feel safer
editing, and copy the code below into your file of choice:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ro.ril.hsxpa=2
ro.ril.gprsclass=12
ro.ril.hep=1
ro.ril.enable.dtm=1
ro.ril.hsdpa.category=28
ro.ril.enable.a53=1
ro.ril.enable.a52=1
ro.ril.enable.3g.prefix=1
ro.ril.htcmaskw1.bitmask=4294967295
ro.ril.htcmaskw1=14449
ro.ril.hsupa.category=9
ro.ril.def.agps.mode=2
ro.ril.def.agps.feature=1
ro.ril.enable.sdr=1
ro.ril.enable.gea3=1
ro.ril.enable.fd.plmn.prefix=23402,23410,23411
</pre>
</p><p>
I generally tend to add my tweaks of preference to the local.prop file, but
after you edit it, reboot your device and enjoy the faster download and
browsing speeds. This method is generally the more difficult of the two
methods that are available. The easiest way to apply tweaks is to do it
with a script. To run a script on Android, you can, in fact, run your script
of choice exactly the same as you do on your Linux desktop, through the
terminal.
</p><p>
Two scripts that I now use to accomplish the above are the V8/V6 Supercharge
and 3G Turbocharger scripts. The V8/V6 script modifies how Android
manages the available system memory as well as various kernel tweaks to
provide a smoother and more fluid Android experience. A simple Web search
will help you find both of these scripts. You can run these scripts in either
of two ways: through the terminal application or a script manager. To run
the script from the terminal, <tt  >su</tt> to root, then navigate to where you
downloaded it to your SD card and run it. To run it from a script manager,
again navigate to the directory where it is located, and run it as root. It
will ask you which scrolling speed you prefer, so select one. Next, the V8/V6
script will present you with 14 different options from which to choose. I like to
multitask without my applications forcibly closing, so I choose option 7,
but there also are options for gaming, aggressive memory management and
balanced management.
</p><p>
It's that simple. Happy tweaking!

<h2 class="title">Elmer for PDEs</h2>

Elmer is an open-source multiphysics simulation software that has been
around since 1995. It is developed by the CSC &mdash; IT Center for Science
Ltd. This group is administered by the Ministry of Education, Science
and Culture in Finland. With Elmer, you can model physical systems, such
as fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, heat transfer and acoustics. All
of those problem areas have one thing in common&mdash;they are all described
by partial differential equations (PDEs).
</p><p>
A PDE is a differential equation that depends on more than
one variable, usually more than one space variable. For example, an
equation that describes how heat gets transferred across a metal plate,
where a is the thermal diffusivity of the metal plate,
would look like the formula shown in Figure 1. 

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11143elmerf1.large.jpg"><img src="11143elmerf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Sample Equation
</p></div></div><p>
Very simple PDEs have exact solutions, 
but anything more complex that describes
more physical situations just can't be solved exactly. This is where
numerical solutions come into play. There are three widely used methods:
finite element, finite volume and finite difference methods. Elmer uses
the finite element method. The basic idea is to break up the problem space
into some kind of a mesh of smaller spaces, and then either eliminate
the PDE completely, by reworking it into a steady state problem on the
mesh, or approximating the PDE with a system of ordinary differential
equations that then are integrated using standard methods, like Euler's
method or Runge-Kutta.
</p><p>
Elmer is distributed under the GPL, so you always can download the source
and compile your very own version. Binaries are available for all
those poor users still stuck on Windows. Packages should be available for
most Linux distributions. For Ubuntu-based distros, you 
simply can use the following to install Elmer and all the necessary libraries:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install elmer
</pre>
</p><p>
Elmer is broken into several parts. ElmerSolver is the
part that actually takes the input files and does the calculations to
evolve the PDE you are interested in. ElmerPost is the
visualization and post-processing tool. With this tool, you actually
can see the results of your calculations. ElmerGrid is the meshing tool
that can create simple 1-D, 2-D and 3-D meshes that will be used to evolve
your PDE. It also can be used to import meshes generated using other
software packages, such as those created using the Ansys tools. 
</p><p>
There
also is a GUI interface called ElmerGUI. ElmerGUI allows you to define
and generate input files for ElmerSolver, as well as import external
meshes from other software (Figure 2). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11143elmerf2.large.jpg"><img src="11143elmerf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. ElmerGUI
</p></div></div><p>
Looking at all of this, you may be thinking, &ldquo;This is
perfect!&rdquo; So, I also should mention some of Elmer's downsides.
Elmer
actually is a suite of tools, and those tools are not always at the same development
level. The documentation tends to lag behind the newest features, and
ElmerGUI may be missing some of the more esoteric methods and models
that ElmerSolver can use. Elmer is a huge system, and like any large
software package, it has a steep learning curve. The tools available
(ElmerGrid) can handle generating only relatively simple meshes. This
means that if you have a very complicated system, you likely will need
to use some other tool to generate the mesh and then import
it into Elmer. If you can work around these possible deficiencies,
Elmer may be exactly the right solution for you.
</p><p>
ElmerGUI is likely to be what most people prefer using. You
can import element mesh files in various formats, generate element
partitionings for geometry input files, set up the PDE systems you want to
solve, and export model data to hand in to ElmerSolver. Most conveniently,
ElmerGui also provides an interface to the parallel version of the solver,
ElmerSolver.mpi. There also is a built-in post-processor that allows you
to view your results right there from ElmerGUI. The menus in ElmerGUI are
fully programmable as well, so you can tune the interface
to match your specific problem area better.
</p><p>
A user forum, wiki and other resources are available at
<a href="http://www.elmerfem.org" target="_self">www.elmerfem.org</a>, and
a very good tutorial is available from the main Elmer Web
site (<a href="http://www.csc.fi/english/pages/elmer" target="_self">www.csc.fi/english/pages/elmer</a>). Along with the tutorial documentation, sample files
are available for each of the cases. Those files can be great starting points
for your own calculations and help you as you are learning the
system. As an example, let's look at the sample &ldquo;Computation of fringe
capacitance&rdquo;. Once you have downloaded the sample files and unpacked
them, you can load the project with File&rarr;Load Project... from
the menu. Once it is loaded, all the input data also is loaded. A
project is simply a directory containing all the files required to
do a computation. The actual mesh is defined by the files mesh.header,
mesh.nodes, mesh.elements and mesh.boundary. The current settings
and state are stored in the file egproject.xml. There also is a solver
input file called case.sif that is handed in to ElmerSolver when you
actually are ready to do your calculations. You can edit this file via
Sif&rarr;Edit... (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11143elmerf3.large.jpg"><img src="11143elmerf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Solver Input File
</p></div></div><p>
You can edit the model details
(like physical constants) via Model&rarr;Setup.... When you are
ready to run your calculation, you can use Run&rarr;Start Solver. This
opens a log window and shows its progress. A convergence monitor
shows how quickly Elmer converges on the results (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11143elmerf4.large.jpg"><img src="11143elmerf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Convergence Monitor
</p></div></div><p>
This creates a new file named case.ep in your project directory
containing the results of your calculation. You can view it using
either Run&rarr;Start Postprocessor or Run&rarr;Postprocessor (VTK)...
(Figure 5). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11143elmerf4.large.jpg"><img src="11143elmerf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Viewing the Results
</p></div></div><p>
As you can see, several tools are available
to help you visualize the results of your calculation.
</p><p>
Now that you have seen a basic example of running one of the tutorials,
what else can Elmer do for you? The solver can handle solving linear
systems. It can do this by using direct methods, through the LAPACK
library, for example. You can use a set of Krylov subspace methods to
do iterative solutions. In order to get rapid convergence though,
you usually need to use some form of preconditioning. A
class of iterative methods called multilevel methods are used for
large linear systems. Elmer provides two options: geometric multigrid and
algebraic multigrid.
</p><p>
More complex, and hence more physically accurate, problems tend to be
nonlinear. This nonlinearity may be as simple as what you see in the full
equation for pendulum motion to the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid
flow to the equations of General Relativity. Elmer deals with nonlinear
systems by first linearizing the equations at each iteration step. How
the equations are linearized depends on exactly which solver method is
being used. For example, the Navier-Stokes solver can use either the
Picard linearization or the Newton linearization.
</p><p>
There are methods for solving time-dependent systems. First-order time
derivatives can be discretized using either the Crank-Nicolson method
or the Backward Differences Formulae. You also can solve eigenvalue
problems with Elmer. These tend to crop up in structural analysis problems,
including factors like elasticity and damping.
</p><p>
For really large problems, you likely will want to look into running
your computation in parallel. Elmer uses MPI as the parallelization
technique, along with domain decomposition as the method of dividing up
the work. The first step is to take the mesh and subdivide it into chunks
or partitions, which, depending on the actual calculation to perform,
will divide the load evenly across all the CPUs. These chunks 
then are sent out to individual CPUs, and the calculation is done. At the end of
the run, the results are combined back into a single result. Because
of the work involved in partitioning and so forth, most users likely will take
advantage of ElmerGUI's parallelization tool.
</p><p>
The last of Elmer's selling points is its modular nature. The solver is
written in FORTRAN 90. This means if you want to add your own
user functions or a complete solver, it is simply a matter of writing
a FORTRAN module and including it in Elmer.
The main Elmer site provides good documentation covering the steps involved. 
</p><p>
Hopefully, this
introduction has given you some ideas of what you can do with Elmer. If you
are studying multiphysics problems, Elmer probably is a very good tool
to learn. It also might be a good tool to introduce in a numerical physics
course, because you can model so much. If you do end up using it in your research
or studies, I would love to hear about it.

Our recent transition to a fully digital magazine has been exciting,
stressful, tumultuous and, thanks to our readers, collaborative. As we
were converting our traditional publishing skills into the digital arena,
we tried hard to preserve the things that make magazines popular. We
didn't want the magazine to become less; we wanted it to become
more. Unfortunately, with all our efforts to maintain useful layouts
and provide interactive reading apps, we did miss an important consumption
model: the traditional e-reader.
</p><p>
We're so thankful for all the feedback we received, and continue to
receive, regarding our digital transition. Thanks to that feedback, we
now offer an epub edition of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, complete with flowing text
