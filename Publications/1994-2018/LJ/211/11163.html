Why has IBM remained sane while HP's gone nuts? One word: engineers.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15f4580.0x16ec300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
When I arrived in Silicon Valley, in August 1985, HP loomed large&mdash;literally. My office was in Palo Alto Square, on the corner of El Camino
Real and Page Mill Road. Across the street on another corner was a little
building preserved as the original post-garage location of Hewlett-Packard.
(It's gone now.) The next block up Page Mill was the sprawling headquarters
for what Hewlett-Packard had become: the largest and most prestigious
company in the whole valley and one of the most desirable places in the
world for an engineer to work.
</p><p>
HP in those days was what people called a &ldquo;Theory Y&rdquo; company
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_X#Theory_Y" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_X#Theory_Y</a>): a place where
work was as enjoyable as play. (&ldquo;Theory X&rdquo; referred to the more-common
form.) Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard were both alive and active then, and
&ldquo;The HP Way&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.hpalumni.org/hp_way.htm" target="_self">www.hpalumni.org/hp_way.htm</a>)
still meant what it said: &ldquo;trust and respect for
individuals...high level of achievement and contribution...uncompromising
integrity...teamwork...flexibility...innovation...&rdquo; and so on.
</p><p>
In his autobiography, <span   class="emphasis"><em>iWoz</em></span>, Steve Wozniac calls the old
HP &ldquo;just the most
perfect company&rdquo;:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
This was in January of 1973, and for an engineer like me, there was no
better place to work in the world. Unlike a lot of technology companies,
Hewlett-Packard wasn't totally run by marketing people. It really respected
its engineers. And that made sense, because this was a company that had
made engineering tools for years&mdash;meters, oscilloscopes, power supplies,
testers of all types, even medical equipment. It made all the things
engineers actually used, and it was a company driven by engineers on the
inside so far as what engineers on the outside needed. Man I loved that.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The distinction between marketing people and engineers is the one between
today's HP and the one that died along with its founders. You could see it
in 1999, when the instrument business&mdash;the original heart and soul of
HP&mdash;was spun off. The name for the new company was Aligent, which
sounds like something you squirt up your nose so you won't sneeze. It still
exists, but who cares? It's not HP.
</p><p>
Spinning off and anonymizing the soul of the company was the last thing
most engineers inside HP would have done, for the simple and obvious reason
that no engineers (or anybody) outside the company wanted it. The same was
true when HP bought Compaq. Both moves were typical of &ldquo;marketing
people&rdquo;,
even as they violated the original function of marketing, which was finding
and serving the true wants and needs of customers.
</p><p>
One could see the same disconnect&mdash;between marketing fantasy and
engineering reality&mdash;in HP's purchase of Palm for $1.2 billion in
April 2010, and its announced decision to kill what was left of Palm's old
business in August 2011. That announcement came at the same time as the
company also revealed that its entire PC division&mdash;including what it
obtained from Compaq (for $25 billion in stock) in 2002&mdash;was for sale.
(The marketing spin was &ldquo;Evaluate Strategic Alternatives&rdquo;:
<a href="http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2011/110818xb.html" target="_self">www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2011/110818xb.html</a>.)
</p><p>
At that moment, HP still was the world's #1 PC vendor, with $40.1 billion in
revenue and $2 billion in operating income for the most recent fiscal year
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></span>
<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/09/08/h-p's-pc-chief-hopes-for-speedy-spinout" target="_self">blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/09/08/h-p's-pc-chief-hopes-for-speedy-spinout</a>). It had a 17.5% market share, with
shipments of 14,888,086 units in Q2 2011 (Gartner:
<a href="http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1744216" target="_self">www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1744216</a>), ahead of Dell
(12.5%), Lenovo (12.0%), Acer (10.9%), ASUS (5.2%) and Toshiba (5.2%). The
more telling difference was in growth. HP's was 3.0%. Dell's was 3.3% and
ASUS's was 3.7%, while Acer was down &ndash;20.4% and Toshiba was down &ndash;1.9%. The
only bright spot was Lenovo, which had a whopping 22.5% growth rate.
</p><p>
And, who's surprised? Which would you rather have&mdash;a ThinkPad from
Lenovo or a whatever-they're-called from one of those other guys? Even
given Lenovo's faint-hearted support for Linux, ThinkPads are the least
clone-like of all the &ldquo;compatible&rdquo; PC laptops. Meanwhile, HP's PCs have
long been nearly anonymous but for the company logo they bear. Without that
small bit of value, what's their distinction? The answer is none, which is
why no other PC maker has bought the division. They already make no-name
computers. So, by announcing the hunt for &ldquo;strategic
alternatives&rdquo;, HP put
a giant &ldquo;GOING OUT OF BUSINESS! EVERYTHING MUST GO!&rdquo; sign in its store
window.
</p><p>
Predictably (to all other than HP, apparently), this wacky move has spooked
the enterprise customers HP intends to serve with more products, services
and devotion. Ray Barnard, chief information officer for Fluor Corp., told
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></span> that his company, which normally spends $25 million
per year on hardware and software, has put on hold its plans to buy new
high-end computers from HP, because &ldquo;It appears they are lost right
now&rdquo;
(<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903895904576544822297017068.html" target="_self">online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903895904576544822297017068.html</a>).
Frank Purdue, vice chancellor for information services at Purdue University
Calumet, told the paper that he has to &ldquo;reassess his tablet
plans&rdquo; and was
unsure how to proceed on other fronts with HP. It's not even worth going
into the circus around the death, rebirth, re-death and persistent
purgatorial state of HP's Android-based TouchPad tablets.
</p><p>
The US National Library of Medicine (<a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov" target="_self">www.nlm.nih.gov</a>) defines psychosis
as &ldquo;a loss of contact with reality, usually including false beliefs about
what is taking place or who one is (delusions) and seeing or hearing things
that aren't there (hallucinations)&rdquo;. There is no better characterization of
HP today, and for the last 12 years or more.
</p><p>
Back at the turn of the Millennium, when IBM announced its love affair
with Linux, I wrote this in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4339" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/4339</a>):
&ldquo;One of the things I observed about the IBM announcement, when they
essentially declared themselves a Linux company, was that this was clearly
a company that was now in full compliance with its own engineers.&rdquo;
</p><p>
That's one more reason why the sale of IBM's PC division to Lenovo made
sense, while HP's rejection of its PC division did not. IBM remains driven,
to the degree it remains sane, by its engineers. HP lost its Way when Dave
and Bill died.
