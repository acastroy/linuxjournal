Reuven's annual list of recommended books and podcasts for open-source developers.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16ce580.0x17c6300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Each year, I like to step back and write an article describing and
recommending some of the computer-related books I have most enjoyed during
the previous 12 months. I'm fortunate to
come across a very wide variety of books, as well as journals and
podcasts, and I enjoy sharing the best of what I've found. I
believe that everyone in our industry should try to keep their skills
up to speed not only by practicing software development, but also
by learning more about it.
</p><p>
My rules for these reviews are pretty simple. If I discovered and read
a book during the past 12 months or so, it's fair game for me to
mention it. It's possible that some of the books I discuss here were written and
published long ago, but if it's new to me, I include it. I
don't promise to be comprehensive. I can judge only the books that
came my way. And, I obviously have my favorite technologies, which
tend to get more of my attention.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16ce580.0x17c6510"></a>
Ruby and Rails</h2></div></div><p>
Ruby continues to be my favorite programming language, one I use
every day, and it pleasantly continues to surprise me. Much of my
work in Ruby is as a Web developer, using the Ruby on Rails framework.
I do share the concerns some have expressed&mdash;that Rails is
becoming too complicated for newcomers, in part because of its
adoption of many new, unusual or Rails-specific technologies in
recent versions. However, I still think that if you're writing a Web
application, you would be wise at least to consider Ruby on
Rails.
</p><p>
I'm not the only person who feels this way, which is why a torrent of
Ruby books continues to be published. One of the best I've seen in
the past year is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Eloquent Ruby</em></span> by Russ Olsen (Addison-Wesley, ISBN
978-0321584106). This book is aimed at intermediate-to-advanced Ruby
programmers who want to write code that's not only functional, but
also takes advantage of the language's best characteristics. Some of
the techniques are a bit advanced, but I'm all in favor of learning
such techniques, even if I never use them, because they deepen my
understanding of the language. This book has deservedly received a
great deal of praise.
</p><p>
For people new to Ruby and who want to learn how to develop Web
applications using Rails, Michael Hartl has produced a book, &ldquo;Ruby on
Rails 3 Tutorial&rdquo; (Addison-Wesley, ISBN 978-0321743121) and an
accompanying video. I must admit I haven't yet watched the
video, but the book is a great introduction to the environment,
spirit and techniques of Rails development. The book has the
attitude that you can learn the Ruby language while you're also
learning Rails, and although I think that a better foundation probably
is appropriate before jumping into Web development, it's far from a fatal
flaw. The book, which is aimed explicitly at beginners, is full of
useful tidbits and hints on Ruby, includes hosting an application on Heroku,
and also is about Rails and Web development in general.
</p><p>
One of the first books about Ruby to be published is <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Ruby
Way</em></span>
by Hal Fulton, and a second edition was published several years ago.
In the wake of this success, Obie Fernandez published <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Rails
Way</em></span>,
an almost encyclopedic description of Ruby on Rails and the way
it can (and should) be used. This past year, Fernandez published an
updated version of this book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Rails 3 Way</em></span> (Addison-Wesley, ISBN
978-0321601667), and although there are many improvements and interesting
tidbits in this book, it's no longer as extensive and encyclopedic as
the previous edition. Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing, given
that Fernandez is well known in the Rails community, and he's trying
to show what technologies he uses, as opposed to the ones that others
might use. That said, I learn something new every time I read through
this book, typically saving me time in the future. So, I recommend
that Rails developers read this book, but only after they've had
sufficient grounding in Rails.
</p><p>
Two more books, both from the Pragmatic Programmers, are worth a look
for Rails developers: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Continuous Testing with Ruby</em></span> by Ben Rady and
Rod Coffin (ISBN 978-1934356708) gives a step-by-step introduction to
the world of automated testing and how you can incorporate it into
your Ruby development environment. Meanwhile, Jose Valim, author of
the popular &ldquo;Devise&rdquo; gem for authentication in Rails, has written
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Crafting Rails Applications</em></span> (ISBN 978-1934356739), which is less an
introduction to Rails applications than a tour of interesting projects
you can do with Rails, using advanced techniques that might well
come in handy.
</p><p>
Finally, I read at least two nice short, independently published books
during the past year. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Rails 3 Upgrade Handbook</em></span> by Jeremy McAnally
(<a href="http://www.railsupgradehandbook.com" target="_self">www.railsupgradehandbook.com</a>) is a short but extremely useful
guide to moving your Rails applications from version 2 to version 3.
If you haven't yet made this change, McAnally walks you through
many of the necessary steps to get it done.
Separately, Avdi Grimm, an independent developer, blogger and
podcaster, published a great little book about exceptions and how to
use them called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Exceptional Ruby</em></span> (<a href="http://exceptionalruby.com" target="_self">exceptionalruby.com</a>).
Unless you're thoroughly schooled in the way Ruby exceptions
work, this is a great book to read through, understand and then put
into practice in your own projects.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16ce580.0x17c6bf0"></a>
JavaScript</h2></div></div><p>
It seems I'm not the only programmer whose feelings about
JavaScript have changed dramatically during the years. First, I dismissed
it as a toy language that wasn't good for much. Next, I cursed it every
time I had to deal with it, because of the strange syntax and
conditions, and then I cursed the implementations of the language, which
were slow, buggy and incompatible with one another. Then, almost
overnight, JavaScript changed&mdash;or at least, my attitude toward it
did. The differences between browsers were easily ignored, thanks to
libraries like Prototype and jQuery. Bugs were fixed, and
JavaScript engines were tuned and re-tuned, making it a very
fast-executing language. And libraries grew over time, such that you
now can do amazing things with JavaScript. I still find the language
to be a bit verbose and annoying in some ways, but there's no doubt
that JavaScript development is an integral part of any modern Web
developer's toolbox, and understanding the way it works is
essential.
</p><p>
Two great books that can help push you forward are <span   class="emphasis"><em>Eloquent
JavaScript</em></span> by Marijn Haverbeke (ISBN 978-1593272821, and at
<a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net" target="_self">eloquentjavascript.net</a>), which introduces programming at a
basic level, but does so by showing many powerful and
interesting techniques JavaScript has to offer. Even if you're a
seasoned JavaScript hacker, it's worth looking at this book. A nice
thing about the on-line edition, available for free at the
URL listed above, is that you can run the code right in your browser.
I've also seen many mentions of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>JavaScript
Cookbook</em></span> by Shelley
Powers (O'Reilly, ISBN 978-0596806132). It doesn't aim to be a
JavaScript tutorial, but rather a collection of short techniques, ideas
and articles describing common tasks that JavaScript coders might need. If
you're using JavaScript&mdash;and nearly all Web developers are doing so
nowadays&mdash;you probably will get a lot out of this book.
</p><p>
Now that JavaScript executes so quickly and is universally available
in browsers, we've seen the beginning of two new trends: Web
frameworks that operate within the browser, using only JavaScript, and
languages that compile into JavaScript, rather than into byte code or
binary executables. For now, the only reference to Backbone.js that I
have seen is a screencast from Peepcode
(<a href="https://peepcode.com/products/backbone-js" target="_self">https://peepcode.com/products/backbone-js</a>), which I enjoyed and from
which I learned quite a bit. Meanwhile, if you're interested in
trying CoffeeScript&mdash;a language that compiles into JavaScript, which
is mandatory in Rails 3.1, and which has taken the JavaScript world by
storm&mdash;you probably should read Trevor Burnham's <span   class="emphasis"><em>CoffeeScript:
Accelerated JavaScript Development</em></span> (Pragmatic Programmers, ISBN
978-1934356784), which introduces the language and describes how you
can use it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16ce580.0x17c6fb8"></a>
Other Technologies</h2></div></div><p>
Although my main language is Ruby, I still like and appreciate Python
quite a bit, and I still get to use it in some of my projects. Mark
Lutz, who has written many editions of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning Python</em></span>
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming
Python</em></span> for O'Reilly has come out with his latest book,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming
Python</em></span> 4th edition (ISBN 978-0-596-15810-1). If you're using Python,
you probably want to have this book on your shelf, so that you can
refer to it on a regular basis. More-advanced Python programmers
would do well to read <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pro Python</em></span> (Apress, ISBN 978-1430227571),
which describes the behind-the-scenes implementation of many Python
idioms, such as metaclasses and common protocols, which really
can come in handy.
</p><p>
HTML and CSS form the foundation of the Web, and HTML5 includes so
many new features that learning them can take some time. From the
Pragmatic Programmers comes <span   class="emphasis"><em>HTML5 and CSS3</em></span> by Brian Hogan. This
book is written well, providing (I think) a gentler introduction to
the subject than many other books. Another great introduction, but
one that focuses on other aspects of HTML5, is Mark Pilgrim's on-line
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dive into HTML5</em></span> (<a href="http://diveintohtml5.org" target="_self">diveintohtml5.org</a>), also available as a
print book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>HTML5: Up and Running</em></span> (O'Reilly, 978-0596806026).
</p><p>
Regular readers of my articles know that I have long used PostgreSQL
for all of my relational database needs. Although I believe that
PostgreSQL is a better fit for most projects than MySQL and offers a
powerful host of features that is a serious match for open-source and
commercial databases alike, it's a sad fact that there aren't very
many books about PostgreSQL on the market. Fortunately, Packt Press
has released two very high-quality books in the past year: <span   class="emphasis"><em>PostgreSQL
9 Administration Cookbook</em></span> by Simon Riggs and Hannu Krosing (ISBN
978-1849510288) and <span   class="emphasis"><em>PostgreSQL 9.0 High Performance</em></span> by Gregory
Smith (ISBN 978-1849510301). I personally refer to these books all
the time when working on clients' projects, and I always learn something
from them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16ce580.0x17c7538"></a>
Other Languages</h2></div></div><p>
Lisp is one of those languages that people either swoon over and dream
about or despise with a passion. I'm strongly in the first category,
and, thus, I continue to enjoy the fact that Lisp books still
are published. A hilarious and excellent introduction to Lisp, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Land of
Lisp</em></span>, teaches Lisp programming and concepts by writing games. I
really enjoyed reading this book, and I think it's worth the time
even if you don't write programs or plan to develop in Lisp.
</p><p>
I'm still working my way through it, but I want to mention
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!</em></span> (No Starch Press, ISBN
978-1593272838), which is both funny and interesting, and it finally
has managed to keep my attention for a while on learning Haskell. I'm not
sure if I'll ever use Haskell in a real project, but I feel like at
least I'm in a better position to understand its strengths and
weaknesses.
</p><p>
R is a statistics language that I've been using for many years, and
it seems to be getting more popular over time. O'Reilly has
published the <span   class="emphasis"><em>R Cookbook</em></span> (ISBN 978-0596809157), which, in contrast to
the many free books available on-line, takes a very practical approach
to doing things in R, whose data types and functions are a bit
different from other languages I've used.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16ce580.0x17c77f8"></a>
Podcasts</h2></div></div><p>
I've become quite a fan of podcasts during the past few years, in part
because I tend to sit on the train a great deal, as well as walk to
clients' offices from the nearest train stop, which isn't always
nearby! Fortunately, many high-quality, interesting
podcasts exist&mdash;far more than I have time to listen to. I'm
listing here those that have to do with open-source and Web
development; obviously many others are available on-line on a
variety of other interesting topics.
</p><p>
Two of my staples are done by the pair of Jason Seifer and Peter
Cooper: &ldquo;The Ruby Show&rdquo; (<a href="http://rubyshow.com" target="_self">rubyshow.com</a>) and its younger sibling
&ldquo;The JavaScript Show&rdquo; (<a href="http://javascriptshow.com" target="_self">javascriptshow.com</a>) are half-hour, weekly
news updates on the state of each of these languages and the
development frameworks built on them. I imagine their humor
is not for everyone, but I find Jason and Peter to be entertaining as
well as informative, and regret when they (or I) miss a week.
</p><p>
Another good open-source podcast is the &ldquo;Changelog&rdquo;
(<a href="http://thechangelog.com" target="_self">thechangelog.com</a>), a weekly hour-long interview podcast
hosted by Adam Stacoviak and Wynn Netherland.
</p><p>
Finally, one of the most thought-provoking and interesting podcasts
I've started to listen to is &ldquo;Ruby Rogues&rdquo; hosted by Charles Max
Wood (<a href="http://rubyrogues.com" target="_self">rubyrogues.com</a>) with a panel of distinguished
Rubyists every week. Now, it's true that the panel comes from the
Ruby world, and the discussion centers around the Ruby language, but
the panelists are serious and clever software engineers who take pride
in their craft and always are learning how to do things better, which
means the discussion is deeper than most other blogs and podcasts
I follow. If you're interested in hearing how truly great
software engineers think, this is a great weekly one-hour dose.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16ce580.0x17c7cc8"></a>
Non-Computer Books</h2></div></div><p>
It's true that I tend to read a great many computer-related books
during the year, but I'm happy to report that I read about other
subjects as well. Two of the most interesting books I've read in
the past year are <span   class="emphasis"><em>Country Driving</em></span> by Peter Hessler (ISBN
978-0061804090), the former China correspondent for the <span   class="emphasis"><em>New
Yorker</em></span>,
who provides an interesting and nuanced picture of modern China.
</p><p>
Another book about that area of the world, which was haunting and
disturbing more than anything else, was <span   class="emphasis"><em>Nothing to
Envy</em></span> by Barbara
Demick (ISBN 978-0385523912), in which she describes what life is like
in North Korea. The stories she tells in this book, based on
interviews with North Koreans who escaped, are beautifully told but
horrifying to read all the same.
</p><p>
I also read two books by Gail Collins, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>New York
Times</em></span> columnist,
about the history of women in America: <span   class="emphasis"><em>When Everything
Changed</em></span>
(covering the 1960s through the present) and <span   class="emphasis"><em>America's
Women</em></span>
(ISBN 978-0060185107), describing the history of the United States
from colonial times through the 1960s, but from a woman's perspective.
</p><p>
Finally, I'm currently in the middle of <span   class="emphasis"><em>How Rome Fell</em></span> by Adrian
Goldsworthy (ISBN 978-0300137194). My high-school history classes
didn't go into much detail on most subjects, and I'm learning through
this book just how much I don't know about an empire that ruled the
part of the world in which I currently live, and whose influence 
still can be felt today by a very large number of people. Although the book
is about how the Roman empire fell, I'm using it as a way to better
understand how it worked when it did, and I'm enjoying having that
opportunity.
</p><p>
I'm sure I could recommend many other books, but
these were the first that came to mind.
My next article will return to our regularly scheduled program, looking
more at open-source Web technologies that can help us put the ideas
from these books into practice for ourselves and our clients.
