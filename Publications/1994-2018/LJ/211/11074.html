How-to: replace a large, inefficient custom-built file server with the Trim-Slice.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16b4580.0x17ac250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For the past several years, I've used a custom-built file server at
my house. I've upgraded it many times, but it began life, as near
as I can recall, in April 2000. When I say &ldquo;upgraded&rdquo;, I mean the
internals have been swapped completely on at least two occasions among
other things. The most-recent major upgrade was in 2006 (or thereabouts)
when I added a software RAID5 with three 500GB hard drives (later expanded to
six). It has chugged along merrily for years, but lately
it has begun showing its age. For starters, two terabytes of space isn't all
that much anymore. Also, it's not as efficient power-wise as I would
like (in my measurements, it draws between 1.8 and 2.0 amps continuously,
depending on load). Finally, the case for this server takes up way too
much space (it's a full tower).
</p><p>
As an experiment, and finally to get rid of that large, inefficient
and ugly tower case, I decided to use the new Trim-Slice as the base for
an ultra-low-power, ultra-small replacement file server. The Trim-Slice is
built on the NVIDIA Tegra 2 platform, and the specific model I purchased
features a 1GHz dual-core ARM Cortex A9 processor, 1GB of RAM
and a 32GB SATA SSD. Did I mention that it's really small? You
know, teeny&mdash;like, I-can't-believe-this-is-a-full-computer small. The
dimensions are 130mm x 95mm x 15mm. For comparison purposes, a standard
3.5" hard drive has dimensions of approximately 146mm x 102mm x 25mm.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11074f1.large.jpg"><img src="11074f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 2. Size Comparison: the Trim-Slice Next to a Nokia N900 and the Ben NanoNote
</p></div></div><p>
On the outside, it has an RS232 serial port, SD and microSD card slots
(both SDHC-compatible), four USB ports, HDMI and DVI-D video out ports,
802.11n and a Gigabit Ethernet port. Inside, it comes with Ubuntu
pre-installed on the SSD (10.10 &ldquo;Maverick&rdquo; was installed on the one I
received, but there is now an update to 11.04 &ldquo;Natty&rdquo;, which I applied
and which I expect is now shipping on newly ordered units).
</p><p>
The full Ubuntu Linux inside is what set this solution above alternatives
like the Drobo FS, ReadyNAS and others, at least in my mind. The
price is in the same ballpark too. The model I ordered, complete with
shipping from Israel, came to $335.
</p><p>
The main downside for my purposes is that there is no place to connect
internal hard drives. I have to make do with external USB drives
instead. I don't like the thought of running a software RAID over USB,
so I further decided simply to use multiple large external USB drives
(each with at least one corresponding backup drive).
</p><p>
To start with, my goal was to replace the old tower server, which
just requires the Trim-Slice and two 2TB external USB hard drives. Yes,
a single hard drive, especially a USB drive, is not as reliable or nearly
as fast as a RAID5 array, but it's a compromise I'm willing to make for
the power, space and noise savings. USB is plenty fast for my needs,
and besides, with two drives, I have a backup.

Anatomy of a File Server</h2></div></div><p>
The purpose of a file server is to serve files over a network. There
are many ways to do this, but I focus on the most common ones here.
</p><p>
First, there is classic &ldquo;file server&rdquo; software: NFS and Samba. These
systems don't care what your data is. All they see are files, and no
file is any different from the next (apart from size and permissions).
</p><p>
The new kids are content-aware file servers like UPnP and DAAP. This
type of file server software does care about content types, and it serves
up metadata about your files along with the files themselves. It will
refuse to serve files it doesn't recognize or support. But, it can do some
tricks that NFS and Samba can't, like alter data on the fly for clients
who can't read the original data. So, they're more fussy than classic
file server software, both to set up and run, but they do have advantages.
</p><p>
UPnP and DAAP are
designed specifically for serving audio, video and image files. DAAP is
built-in, or available as a plugin, for many popular audio jukebox apps,
such as Rythmbox, Amarok and Banshee, but there also are standalone
server applications available. UPnP Media Server support is built in
to various consumer devices, such as the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and
various handheld and set-top media players.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16b4580.0x17accf8"></a>
NFS</h2></div></div><p>
NFS is the classic Network File System, and it is has been in use for
decades on Linux and UNIX. The Popcorn Hour media player connected to
my TV supports NFS, and I don't have any Windows computers, so NFS is
really the only classic file-serving protocol I need (or want) on my
network. NFS has very limited security, so it's not ideal for everyone,
but it's lightweight and easy to configure. In my opinion, if you have
a device that supports NFS and SMB, go with NFS.
</p><p>
On Ubuntu, the NFS server I use is called nfs-kernel-server, and you can
install it with the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server
</pre>
</p><p>
To create an nfs share, edit the /etc/exports file, and add the directory
you want to export. Here is an example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
/mnt/disk01 popcorn(ro,sync,root_squash,no_subtree_check)
</pre>
</p><p>
The above line exports the /mnt/disk01 directory to my Popcorn Hour,
with the following flags:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >ro</tt> &mdash; read only: in other words, don't allow
anything that
could change the filesystem. The Popcorn Hour has the
ability to delete items, but I don't want to let my kids
delete things arbitrarily or accidentally with the remote.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >sync</tt> &mdash; reply to requests only after the changes have been
committed to stable storage.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >root_squash</tt> &mdash; map requests from uid/gid 0 to the anonymous uid/gid. This
makes things a little more secure.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >no_subtree_check</tt> &mdash; from the man page: &ldquo;This option disables subtree checking,
which has mild security implications, but can improve
reliability in some circumstances.&rdquo; See the man page for
more information (<tt  >man exports</tt>).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
With the line in place, I run the <tt  >sudo exportfs
-ra</tt> command to
refresh the exports. Then on the Popcorn Hour, I can mount the exported
directory, and away I go. There are several other options you can use in
the /etc/exports file. See the exports man page for details.
</p><p>
The example entry above can't be mounted on any other host, but to
permit other hosts to do so, I either can change
<tt  >popcorn</tt> to the
IP address and netmask of the network I want to share it with (for
example, 192.168.10.0/24 for every host with an IP address starting with
192.168.10.), or I can add additional host definitions to the end of
the line.
</p><p>
With the exports file updated and refreshed, I can mount the export with
something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo mount -t nfs trimslice:/mnt/trimslice/disk01 
 &#8618;/mnt/trimslice/disk01
</pre>
</p><p>
Or, I could add an entry like the following to my /etc/fstab file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
trimslice:/mnt/trimslice/disk01  /mnt/trimslice/disk01  
 &#8618;nfs  defaults  0 0
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16b4580.0x17ad850"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and the NFS share always would be mounted at boot time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16b4580.0x17ad958"></a>
Samba SMB/CIFS</h2></div></div><p>
Samba, aka SMB/CIFS, is how you go about sharing files with computers
running Windows. If I had a Windows machine or two, using Samba would be
a given. I don't, but I'll go ahead and describe the process here. For
starters, Samba is installed on the Trim-Slice with the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install samba
</pre>
</p><p>
After installation, edit the /etc/samba/smb.conf file to set up your
shares (add them to the end of the file). A read-only share equivalent
to the NFS one described above is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[disk01]
    comment = trimslice disk01
    path = /mnt/disk01
    browsable = yes
    guest ok = yes
    read only = yes
</pre>
</p><p>
Add the above to the end of the smb.conf file, and the share will pop into
existence on the network. With Samba, there is no need to restart the
service or run a command after editing the smb.conf file; any changes
are applied automatically as soon as the file is saved.
</p><p>
It's a good idea to uncomment the <tt  >security = user</tt> line in the smb.conf
file to add some security (and if you do want security, you should set
<tt  >guest ok</tt> in the above example to
<tt  >no</tt>). And, if you have a proper Windows
network, you should change the <tt  >workgroup</tt> name in the smb.conf file to
the actual name of your Windows workgroup.
</p><p>
As with NFS, you can enter a lot more settings in the smb.conf
file to tweak things just the way you want them. The default file
is filled with examples, and the Samba documentation goes into even
greater detail.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16b4580.0x1ba6020"></a>
DAAP</h2></div></div><p>
DAAP, in case you are interested, stands for Digital Audio Access
Protocol. An older, but serviceable, standalone DAAP server for Linux
is mt-daapd, also known as the Firefly Media Server. Unfortunately,
it is not under active development. Some forks are in the works
(which aren't in the Ubuntu repositories yet), so maybe the situation
will improve in the future. To install it, do the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install mt-daapd
</pre>
</p><p>
After installing mt-daapd, set the password for the admin account in the
/etc/mt-daapd.conf file. Technically, the password already is set,
but it's good practice to change it. You can
tweak other settings in the file, but the GUI is easier.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11074f3.large.jpg"><img src="11074f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. mt-daapd, aka the Firefly Media Server
</p></div></div><p>
After changing the password, restart mt-daapd with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo /etc/init.d/mt-daapd restart
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, go to the Web interface to configure it:
http://trimslice:3689
(replace &ldquo;trimslice&rdquo; in the URL with the correct IP address or
name).
</p><p>
The configuration page is simple and self-explanatory. You can set the
name, change the admin password and set a password for listening to
the music (in case you don't want to share your collection of classic
Dr. Who music with everyone on your network). You also set which folder
or folders contain your music (multiple folders can be specified). Finally,
you can configure how often to have mt-daapd rescan your music folder(s).
</p><p>
Once the changes are to your liking, pressing the Save button 
saves the settings to the /etc/mt-daapd.conf file. But, the GUI is there
so you might as well use it.
</p><p>
All should be well and good at this point. Unfortunately, mt-daapd,
as packaged in the repository the Trim-Slice uses, does not support
FLAC files. If your collection is mostly MP3 files, that won't be an
issue. If it is an issue, your options are to compile your own, live
with the limitation or find an alternative.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16b4580.0x1ba65f8"></a>
UPnP</h2></div></div><p>
For serving up video files to my PS3, I use the MediaTomb UPnP
media server. Or at least, I would, if I didn't have the Popcorn
Hour. MediaTomb, like mt-daapd, is a nice piece of software and
works just fine for what it does, but devices like the PS3 can be very
picky about what file types they will support. On-the-fly transcoding
(supported by both mt-daapd and MediaTomb) can eliminate some of
these issues, especially with audio files (for example, by transcoding
a FLAC file to WAV while it is being transferred, so that iTunes can play
it). Transcoding isn't practical for video files though. It can be done,
but the CPU requirements are hefty to say the least, especially when
you start talking about 720p and larger video files.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11074f4.large.jpg"><img src="11074f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The Media Tomb File Browser
</p></div></div><p>
Limitations aside, installing and configuring MediaTomb is similar to
mt-daapd. First, enter the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install mediatomb-daemon
</pre>
</p><p>
After the install completes, edit the /etc/mediatomb/config.xml file to
enable the graphical user interface (GUI) and set the default user and
password. To do this, change <tt  >enabled="no"</tt> in the following lines to
<tt  >enabled="yes"</tt> (both of them), and set the password to something more
secure:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;ui enabled="no" show-tooltips="yes"&gt;
  &lt;accounts enabled="no" session-timeout="30"&gt;
    &lt;account user="mediatomb" password="mediatomb"/&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The above lines should be near the top of the file. Save the file, and
restart the server with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo /etc/init.d/mediatomb stop
sudo /etc/init.d/mediatomb start
</pre>
</p><p>
Once restarted, connect to 
http://trimslice:49152/.
Enter the user name and password, and you will be in the GUI. To add a
folder, click the Filesystem link, and browse to the folder you want
MediaTomb to index. With the correct folder selected in the left pane,
click on the plus, or plus-with-a-circle icon, to have MediaTomb scan
the contents of the folder. The plus-with-a-circle icon adds the folder
as an autoscan folder, meaning it will rescan the folder periodically
looking for new files.
</p><p>
For PS3 support, a couple lines need to be changed in
the config.xml file; they are commented and easy to find if you
search for &ldquo;PS3&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16b4580.0x1ba6c80"></a>
Backups</h2></div></div><p>
With this new file server, I lose the protection of RAID, so backups are
more important. RAID, of course, does not eliminate the need for backups;
it just makes the primary filesystem more reliable. Because I already
needed backups with my old setup, I had a backup system in place.
</p><p>
The &ldquo;system&rdquo; itself is a custom rsync backup shell script. The backup
drive contains several directories: one named current and then 14
others named 01, 02, 03 and so on, up to 14. The basic flow of
the script is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rm -rf '14'
mv '13' '14'
mv '12' '13'
...
mv '01' '02'
cp -al 'current' '01'
rsync drive-to-back-up to 'current'
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >-al</tt> part of the copy command above is important. It tells the command to
operate in archive mode, which preserves attributes and copies directories
recursively, and to create hard links instead of actually copying the
files. When rsync comes upon a changed file, it will de-link the file
before updating it, so the combination of rsync and the cp command gives
me 14 days of backups (assuming the script is run once a day).
</p><p>
The extra space required for these backups is low, so I can use the same
size drive for the backups that I do for the primary. Once a backup drive
starts nearing its limit, the primary drive likely will be close to its
limit too, and it will be time to shop for an additional pair of drives.
</p><p>
I've used variations of this script for years, and if I had to start
from scratch today, I might use it or something else. Lots of
excellent backup programs are available for Linux. The point is to 
<span   class="emphasis"><em>make</em></span> backups, as many as necessary.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16b4580.0x1ba70a0"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The Trim-Slice has worked out very well as a file server. The built-in
serial port lets me operate it completely without a monitor, and the
hardware has so far been more than adequate for my household's modest
file-serving needs.
</p><p>
With dual 2TB external USB disk drives (and more to come), the Trim-Slice
is even more energy-efficient than I thought it would be. My consumer-grade &ldquo;Kill-a-Watt&rdquo; power meter (which I admit is probably not very
accurate) shows an average power draw of 0.28 amps, which, completely
accurate or not, is much better than the 1.8 to 2.0 amps the old server
was pulling. The power draw of the Trim-Slice by itself is an astounding
0.08 amps.
</p><p>
Power is just one benefit. I also like the smaller footprint. Noise is
much better too. The old case needed several fans, but the Trim-Slice
is passively cooled. There are fans in the external drive enclosures,
but they don't come on very often, and when they do, I don't notice them
at all. The Trim-Slice does get a bit hot to the touch, but I suppose
that's what you get when you make the outer casing a heat sink.
</p><p>
The jury is still out on how long this new setup will last. I consider USB
drives to be less reliable, and although the build quality of the Trim-Slice
appears high, it's a new product with no history. To mitigate this,
I am going to be very careful to make sure important stuff is copied
across all future drives. Despite my worries, I must admit, I did replace
a few of the drives in my RAID5 over the years, and I don't imagine the
difference in reliability will be so great as to cause any huge problems.
