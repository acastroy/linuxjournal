    Speakeasy was conceived around March of 1994. The main impetus
    was that while the Internet was fascinating to me, I found the
    necessity of access only at home to be both socially debilitating
    and much too slow.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfbc580.0x10b4240"></a></h2></div></div><p>I interviewed Mike Apgar, owner of the
Speakeasy Caf&eacute; in Seattle, by e-mail on July 15. I not only
got answers from Mike but also from Chris Osburn, Speakeasy Network
Administrator. Mr. Apgar has a varied history of work in computers
as a programmer and analyst. He started Speakeasy with a team of
people including an architect, a designer, an attorney, a systems
administrator, a playwright and a business executive (his dad).
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Let's start with a
few questions about Speakeasy. What factors convinced you to open a
cybercaf&eacute;?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mike</b></span>: Speakeasy was
conceived around March of 1994. The main impetus was that while the
Internet was fascinating to me, I found the necessity of access
only at home to be both socially debilitating and much too
slow.</p><p>One evening a friend was visiting me, and he needed to find
some specific information about a health topic for a play he was
writing. We had a great time searching the Web and discovered that
the Web can be a lot more fun when you're browsing it with other
people.</p><p>One day, not more than a week later, I heard an interview
with William Gibson in which he mentioned SFNet (the network of
public access, &ldquo;local-net&rdquo; at the time) terminals.</p><p>I thought of creating a caf&eacute; at that very moment&mdash;one
that would be a caf&eacute; as you usually think of one: a casual
place to have a cup of coffee, not necessarily
&ldquo;computer-centric&rdquo;.</p><p>My wife Gretchen and I talked about it that evening and
decided on the name &ldquo;speakeasy&rdquo;&mdash;we loved the double entendre and
had always held a certain fascination for the old speakeasies of
the prohibition era.</p><p><a href="2422f2.jpg" target="_self">Figure 1</a></p><p>We knew that it would be about people connecting but had no
idea what a success it would be, only that we would run a &ldquo;nice
little caf&eacute;&rdquo; and &ldquo;do our own thing&rdquo;.</p><p>Later, months before opening, we got more ambitious&mdash;please
see our mission statement at
http://www.speakeasy.org/speakeasy/cafe/mission.html.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: When did you open?
your location?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mike</b></span>: We opened in June of
1995 at 2304 2nd Ave in Belltown, downtown Seattle.</p><p><a href="2422f3.jpg" target="_self">Figure 2</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: What is your repeat
customer percentage? How big is your regular clientele?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mike</b></span>: Our repeat customer
rate is very high, though I don't have a specific percentage. We
probably have around 800-1000 very regular customers&mdash;meaning at
least once a week.</p><p>We believe there is a natural tendency for people to form a
community in order to trade ideas, tips, secrets, hints and simply
communicate about collective situations. Internet computer
technology is a powerful tool that helps create such a community.
This very thing has happened twice before in this century: first
with radio, next with television. As we live in an ever more
pressing age for people to communicate and resolve, reason and
understand one another, our efforts are designed to facilitate that
information exchange.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Do you get a pretty
varied clientele? Any particular age group or profession that come
more than others?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mike</b></span>: It seems to be
weighted in a couple of directions&mdash;twenties mostly, with a large
number of people &ldquo;in multi-media fields&rdquo; as well as people in
computers and the arts in general. Another large part of our
customer base is more of the thirties and forties crowd that are
professional and often net-savvy.</p><p>In general, our service appeals to people of all ages. For
example, the virtual tours we hold on a regular basis have wide
appeal to people who do not associate themselves with the computer
age. These classes and special events showcase and educate users on
specific opportunities on-line and examine the current and
potential roles for technology in our communities.</p><p><a href="2422f1.jpg" target="_self">Figure 3.</a></p><p>The caf&eacute; is a place for people to gather at any hour.
People stop in before work to get their espresso. While waiting,
they read news from around the world, send e-mail to a friend
across the country or post an article to the local Speakeasy
newspapers, electronic magazines or classified advertisements.
After work they drop by to read through personal ads, send a bit of
electronic mail to the mayor or vote on future Speakeasy
events.</p><p>Also, in the evenings we draw a large variety of customers,
young and old, for our entertainment: the art gallery, live music,
poetry readings, film or readings&mdash;most happen once a week. The Art
Gallery, curated by Tina LaPadula, rotates a new show every 6
weeks.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: How many computers
do you have?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mike</b></span>: We have 9 graphical
workstations and 12 text-only &ldquo;VT100&rdquo; style terminals&mdash;that's 2
PCs, 1 Mac and 6 X terminals. All graphical terminals have 17-inch
color monitors.</p><p>We are bringing Windows applications to the X-terminals
through a new server application called Win-Center by NCD. This is
currently in beta&mdash;we're hoping to provide access to the major
Windows applications that don't have a Unix counterpart, such as
MS-Office and Adobe Photoshop. We are, however, planning to offer
WordPerfect on the X-terminals as soon as possible, perhaps the
entire Corel Office Suite.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: How do you charge
for computer time? If you have a monthly membership rate, how many
people take you up on it?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mike</b></span>: Our graphical
terminals are anywhere from $6-10 per hour, depending on whether
you are a Speakeasy member. The PCs and Macs have a higher hourly
rate.</p><p>Members can buy &ldquo;bulk-time&rdquo; and get rates as low as
$3.50/hour. Monthly membership is $10/month, $50/6 months or $90
for a year and includes an e-mail account (mike@speakeasy.org),
10MB of disk space for non-commercial web pages or simply file
storage, <span   class="emphasis"><em>free</em></span> use of our text-only terminals
and access at all RAIN sites (Remote Access Internet Nodes). For
more details on RAIN, see our web site at
http://www.speakeasy.org/rain/.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: What kind of
services do you offer? I hear the Pacific Northwest Ballet has a
web page set up through you.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mike</b></span>: In short, we provide:
Web Design, Web Hosting, Dedicated Connectivity (Modem, ISDN),
Firewalls, Mail and File Servers (often Linux), LAN Integration and
general LAN assistance and quite a bit of general small business
consultation related to the Internet.</p><p>For even more details, I'd kindly refer you to
http://www.speakeasy.org/speakeasy/network/, and our own web site
at http://www.speakeasy.org/.</p><p>We provide some or all of the above services to over 300
commercial clients/organizations including: The Seattle Symphony,
Virginia Mason, Pyramid Brewery, The Seattle Opera, Washington
CEO/Fivash Publishing, Media Index/Media-Inc, KeyStaff, LifeSpan
BioSciences, Sonus Pharmaceuticals, Bumbershoot, AT&amp;T Summer
Nights, AT&amp;T Family Fourth, Puget Sound Community School and
many many more&mdash;our full client list is available at
http://www.speakeasy.org/speakeasy/clients/.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Chris</b></span>: And yes, the Ballet,
at http://www.pnb.org/.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: I understand you are
using the Linux operating system. How are you using it and why did
you choose it?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Chris</b></span>: We currently have
four Linux servers in the caf&eacute;. We use them for internal
routing, Usenet and WWW service. We are using a couple as X
workstations&mdash;one runs SAMBA to serve files to the inevitable
Windows PCs. We chose Linux because of its price and its reputation
for stability.</p><p>One exciting application is the RAIN sites, mentioned
earlier. RAIN sites are terminals we've placed in other coffee
shops and public locations around Seattle. At RAIN sites with more
than one terminal, we've placed a small 386 with a multiport serial
card to act as a terminal server. Over time, we've actually gotten
everything we need to fit on one floppy, eliminating the need for a
hard drive. The whole OS and necessary services run on a RAM
disk.</p><p>We typically specify Linux when setting up mail servers and
firewalls for clients, mainly to ease remote maintenance of these
resources.</p><p>And in the caf&eacute;, our developers are so CPU-hungry that
NT may as well be &ldquo;Not There&rdquo;.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Give us the details
of how you have the system configured. Are you using the Apache web
server?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Chris</b></span>: We generally start
with Slackware, though we've been using Red Hat as well. We do use
Apache for our web servers. Again, the price is right, and we can
modify the server for our own needs.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Does Linux work well
for you? How do you compare it to other operating systems that you
have used?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Chris</b></span>: I find Linux easy to
install, fast in execution, and very well supported. (I may be
biased&mdash;I learned Unix well before Microsoft got the DOS contract.
As far as I'm concerned, they've been playing catch-up ever since.)
The operating system is extremely stable. One system, primarily
used as a development machine, but also serving as an internal
router, web server and development box, has been up 160 days as I
write this. We've actually been putting off hardware upgrades,
waiting for it to crash.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Do you feel
cybercaf&eacute;s are here to stay or will they go the way of other
fads?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mike</b></span>: Public Internet Access
is definitely here to stay. Many &ldquo;cybercaf&eacute;s&rdquo; (we don't
describe ourselves that way, by the way) are trying to build a
business on the novelty of high-speed Internet access or just plain
Internet access in a caf&eacute;, and there is no more of a certain
future in that approach than in any other restaurant/caf&eacute;
business, I'm afraid&mdash;probably even less.</p><p>From the beginning, we planned for the long-term. I think the
variety of services we offer, and the atmosphere of the caf&eacute;
describes that well. It seems to have worked for us; we're
beginning our third year in business and are growing very
fast.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: What role do you
think Linux will play in the future of cybercaf&eacute;s?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Chris</b></span>: I don't know about a
role for Linux in cybercaf&eacute;s in general&mdash;however, I can
speak for our business. Linux continues to play an ever larger role
in everything we do. Look for us to bring Linux forward as a part
of our advertising and marketing efforts. It's very fast, very
stable and growing in sophistication many times faster than other
versions of Unix and certainly has more to offer at this point than
other popular operating systems.</p><p><a href="2422s1.html" target="_self">Mission Statement</a></p></div></div>
