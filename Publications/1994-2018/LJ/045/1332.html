    Need to get rid of a job that's gotten into a loop and
    refuses to end? Here's a command that will take care of the
    problem.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187c580.0x19744a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Linux is a powerful operating system.
With its demand-paged memory management and swap file facility, it
lets you start as many processes as you choose. Of course, that
number is subject to overall system memory capacity (physical
memory plus swap) and your CPU's ability to perform all the tasks
you have requested. Starting processes is easy, and when things
slow to a crawl, stopping them is just as easy.
</p><p>The Linux <span   class="bold"><b>kill</b></span> command is
one of two that will meet your need when you grow tired of waiting
for a process to terminate. With it, you can, in the words of my
1992 Linux Programmer Manual, terminate a process with extreme
prejudice. All you need to know is a number called the process PID.
Note that kill doesn't always terminate another process. In
essence, kill sends a signal to a specified process. If that signal
is not caught and handled by the process (not all can be), the
process is terminated. All of the resources that were in use by the
process are released for use by other running processes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187c580.0x1974660"></a>Processes and PIDs</h2></div></div><p>What are processes, PIDs and signals? How are they
discovered?</p><p>Recall that Linux is a multi-tasking operating system. When
Linux boots, it starts a program called
<span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span>, which in turn starts other
programs. Many of these are background tasks like
<b  >update</b>, which periodically flushes data to the
disk. Another example is <b  >getty</b>, which watches a
serial port for some sign of activity. A more visible example is
the shell you use to perform useful work. It runs in the
foreground, which means that it waits on your keystrokes. Each copy
of each program running on your system is called a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>process</em></span>.</p><p>Just as the US government passes out Social Security Numbers
(we use Social Insurance Numbers here in Canada) to uniquely
identify each individual, Linux assigns each process a unique
number as an identifier. This number is called the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>process ID</em></span> or <span   class="emphasis"><em>PID</em></span>.</p><p>When a process is started, it is given the next available
PID, and when it terminates, its PID is released for eventual
re-use. To determine the PID of any process belonging to you, enter
<b  >ps</b> at the prompt. The <b  >ps</b>
command will print, for each of your processes, a line containing
the process's PID, the amount of time the process has used and the
command with which the process was started. The output from
<b  >ps</b> looks like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 PID  TT STAT   TIME COMMAND
 6651  p0 S      0:01 -ksh&lt;\n&gt;
 6661  p1 S      0:00 -ksh
 6738  p2 S      0:00 -ksh
 6746  p2 S      0:00 wheel
 6747  p2 S      0:00 wheel
 7002  p0 S      0:01 elm
 7193  p1 R      0:00 ps
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187c580.0x1974be0"></a>Signals</h2></div></div><p>Signals are a form of process communication. Because they can
come from another process, the kernel or the process itself, they
might be better thought of as events that occur as a program runs.
A crude example might be the bell most of us remember from our
early days in school; when the bell rang, we reacted by switching
from playful children to industrious students.</p><p>The signals we will use below are the termination signal
<b  >SIGTERM</b>, the interrupt signal
<b  >SIGINT</b> and the kill signal
<b  >SIGKILL</b>. These signals usually occur because
another process sent them. You probably already use one of them;
typing ctrl-c sends the interrupt signal <b  >SIGINT</b>
to your current foreground process. Other signals&mdash;such as
<b  >SIGPIPE</b>, which is sent to a process writing to a
broken pipe&mdash;usually come from the kernel. There are about 30
signals, all of which can be referred to by numbers or by names,
but the numbers change between platforms and some signals are
unavailable on some platforms. The complete list of signals can be
found on the signal(7) manual page; enter <b  >man 7
signal</b> to see it or enter <b  >kill -1</b> for
a short version of this list.</p><p>For each signal there is a default action, almost all of
which terminate the process. For most signals, a program may
specify another action&mdash;this is called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>catching</em></span> or <span   class="emphasis"><em>handling</em></span> the
signal&mdash;or may specify that no action occurs, which is called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ignoring</em></span> the signal. The signal
<b  >SIGKILL</b> cannot be caught or ignored; it always
terminates processes.</p><p>For example, suppose you use <b  >cat</b> to list a
large text file without first determining the size of the file.
Instead of watching hundreds, perhaps thousands of lines scroll by
too quickly to read, you send the <b  >cat</b> process
the interrupt signal by pressing Ctrl-c. Fortunately,
<b  >cat</b> was not programmed to catch
<b  >SIGINT</b>, and the <b  >cat</b> process
is terminated immediately.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187c580.0x1975370"></a>Using kill</h2></div></div><p>Suppose we had inadvertently started <b  >cat</b>
in the background; Ctrl-c would be ineffective, because the signal
wouldn't get to the <b  >cat</b> process. So we need to
send it a signal some other way. With the command
<span   class="bold"><b>kill</b></span>, you can send any signal to
any process you own. The command's syntax is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
kill -SIGNAL
</pre><p>If no signal is specified on the
<span   class="bold"><b>kill</b></span> command line, the terminate
signal <b  >SIGTERM</b> (default) is sent. This will
normally terminate the process in question. If it fails to do
so&mdash;that is, <b  >SIGTERM</b> was caught or ignored&mdash;you
can send the signal <b  >SIGKILL</b>, which will always
terminate the process.
</p><p>Thus, we might do the following to terminate our runaway
<b  >cat</b> process commands. First determine the
PID:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ps
  PID  TT STAT   TIME COMMAND
 2037  p0 S      0:01 cat
</pre><p>Now, kill process 2037, which is the <b  >cat</b>
process:
<pre     class="programlisting">
kill 20371
</pre>


If <b  >cat</b> had been written to catch
<b  >SIGTERM</b>, we would have to use a signal that
cannot be caught or ignored.
<pre     class="programlisting">
kill -SIGKILL 20371
</pre>


In addition to killing errant processes, kill can be used to inform
processes that the status of something has changed. For example,
suppose you are writing a program and you wish to have it change
its mode of operation on the occurrence of some external event. By
coding what is called an &ldquo;interrupt handler&rdquo; in your program, you
can have it catch any number of signals which have meaning to you.
In particular, you might choose SIGUSR1 or SIGUSR2, which are
non-specific. By sending your chosen signal, you can make your
program aware of the change in circumstances, so it can proceed
into its alternate mode of operation.
</p><p>When you use kill, the desired signal is sent only to
processes you own (that is, processes that you invoked). This
prevents inadvertent termination of the wrong process. The
exception is that the superuser (root) can use kill to send a
signal to any process. Similarly, any process owned by root can
send a signal to any other process.</p><p>An orderly shutdown of your system can occur in this way.
While the kill command is not used at shutdown, the equivalent
system call <b  >kill(2)</b> is used to terminate
everything. This guarantees that no files are left open and that
all buffers are written to disk. For a description of
<b  >kill(2)</b>, enter <b  >man 2 kill</b> at
the prompt.</p><p>A related command is
<span   class="bold"><b>killall</b></span>, which takes the name of
the process as an argument rather than the process ID (PID). (Some
versions of kill can take process names too.) This is a convenient
way to terminate all processes with the same name. If a path is
used to identify the process to be signaled, only the processes
executing that particular file are selected. In addition, you can
ask to be consulted before <span   class="bold"><b>killall</b></span>
kills a particular process, and you can receive confirmation that
the signal was actually sent.</p><p>Although full details are listed in the
<b  >man</b> page, an example may be useful here. Suppose
you have two programs that are different but have the same
name&mdash;perhaps different release levels. In order to be different
and have the same name, they must be stored in different
directories. Assume they have the name
<b  >sample_prog</b>, but one is stored in /usr/a and the
other in /usr/b. Entering <b  >ps</b> gives the following
output:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 PID TTY STAT  TIME COMMAND
123 pp0   S     0:03  /usr/a/sample_prog
124 pp1   R     0:02  /usr/b/sample_prog
</pre><p>The following commands perform different actions:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# To kill both processes
killall sample_prog
# To kill only process 123
killall /usr/a/sample_prog
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187c580.0x196c860"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>In summary, the <span   class="bold"><b>kill</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>killall</b></span> commands can be useful
tools to control the execution of processes on your Linux system.
In combination with other tools described in previous &ldquo;Take
Command&rdquo; columns, they will allow you to become true masters of a
very powerful desktop appliance. For specific information on their
very few options, and for a description of the signals they can
invoke, read the relevant manual pages (enter <b  >man
kill</b> or <b  >man killall</b> at the
prompt).</p></div></div>
