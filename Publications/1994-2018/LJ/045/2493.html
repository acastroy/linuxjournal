use the Ricochet modem radio. The reality is that these devices
work quite nicely on desktop systems as well as on laptops.</p><p>I read of these modems in the local free computer newspaper,
but since I was quite happy with my 56Kbps frame-relay connection,
I didn't give them much consideration. Then one day my connection
failed and I realized I had no backup for Internet access. After a
quick trip to a local computer store and a few minutes configuring
a PPP connect script, I was back in action. The frame relay was
fixed shortly thereafter, but I still have my Ricochet modem. I use
it when visiting client sites and when testing firewall
configurations, and I used it on the one occasion when the frame
went down again. I've also loaned it to friends suffering from
phone noise and ISP mismanagement.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbaf580.0xca7978"></a>How Does One Use It?</h2></div></div><p>Plug it into your serial port. It has two connections: one
for external power and one to connect to your computer. The
computer sees it as a Hayes-compatible modem with a few additional
AT (i.e., standard modem) commands.</p><p>I mentioned that I had to fiddle with the PPP connection
scripts. As with most computer hardware, Metricom provides software
for operation with the Apple and Microsoft operating systems. Since
Linux comes with support for PPP dial up, there is no need to load
their software. One has only to make some small but crucial changes
to the scripts. The <span   class="bold"><b>ppp-on-dialer</b></span>
script needs to send the strings:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ATZ
ATE0X4Q0V1&amp;C1&amp;D2&amp;K3
</pre><p>to the modem to ensure that the configuration is correct. My
<span   class="bold"><b>ppp-on</b></span> script needed the line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
route del default
</pre>


because my system is also on a local LAN and normally gateways
through the frame relay. The phone number, 777**PPP, looks unusual;
it means &ldquo;connect to the regular Internet service using the PPP
protocol.&rdquo; The script doesn't need a user name or password because
the modem's serial number is used for authentication. As long as
your account is current, your connection is established with a
dynamically allocated IP address. Listings of these two scripts are
available by anonymous download in the file
<a href="../listings/045/2493.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue45/2493.tgz</a>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbaf580.0xca7ce8"></a>How Does It Work?</h2></div></div><p>First, the Ricochet is not a cell-phone modem. It is based on
an infrastructure which is independent of the various telephone
systems. Metricom has been in the wireless communication business
since 1985&mdash;providing remote-access monitoring of meters to public
utilities. The Ricochet division was started two years ago in order
to offer wireless Internet connectivity to the public. They're
currently offering service in the metropolitan areas of Seattle,
San Francisco Bay, West Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. Metricom
plans to extend coverage in the Los Angeles area by the end of this
year and installation is underway in New York City.</p><p>If you pay attention, you'll see cell-phone antenna towers or
roof-top clusters appearing everywhere. The Ricochet system is
quite a bit harder to spot. There are three elements: the &ldquo;modem
radio&rdquo; attached to your computer, a shoe box sized &ldquo;microcell
radio&rdquo; attached to streetlamp poles at quarter mile intervals and
&ldquo;wired access points&rdquo; to serve thirty or so microcell radios.
(Seattle has 1800 microcell radios and 50 wired access points.) For
instance, in this map of a Seattle neighborhood the small dots are
the microcell radios, the red stars are wired access points, and
the blue star is the home of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.
(The map is a product of a U.S. Census bureau server using the URL
(without breaks) http://tiger.census.gov/cgi-bin/mapbrowser?
lat=47.676&amp;lon=-122.366&amp;wid=0.10&amp;ht=0.050&amp;
on=GRID&amp;murl=http://www.aa.net/~bentson/tms&amp;
iwd=640&amp;iht=720. (See Figure 1.)</p><p><a href="2493f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Seattle Area Map</b></span></a></p><p>Just as the Internet uses a store-and-forward model to get
data from one place to another, Ricochet packets are forwarded from
pole to pole from the modem radio to the wired access point, at
which point they enter the conventional Internet routing. Because
this service is packet based, you don't consume resources when
you're not sending or receiving bits. Therefore, you're welcome to
establish a connection and leave it live for as long as you wish.
This is a dramatic change from telephone-based Internet
services.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbaf580.0xca8000"></a>What's The Future?</h2></div></div><p>Since I got my modem last fall, Metricom has offered two new
products: a modem (without battery) for fixed stations and a newer,
lighter weight version (8 ounce versus 13 ounce) of the portable
modem. An even lighter version is being tested for palm-top
computers. In addition, Ricochet has distributed a firmware upgrade
that allows a roaming user to remain connected while moving from
one wired-access-point coverage area to another.</p><p>The current technology operates in the 908-926MHz band,
dividing it into 162 channels, each 160KHz wide. Each connection
hops among these channels using spread spectrum technology. Modem
radios provide a connection with performance comparable to a
28.8Kbps modem, but may burst higher. (That's why they recommend
setting the serial port to 57.6Kbps.) Future models will use more
channels and other bands to provide better coverage and higher
speeds (128Kbps to 512Kbps).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbaf580.0xca8160"></a>What If You're Not In One of The &ldquo;Blessed
Cities&rdquo;?</h2></div></div><p>If you're traveling, you'll find service outside of these
cities in airports such as Minneapolis-Saint Paul International
Airport, Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport and La Guardia Airport in New
York City.</p><p>Several schools, including Austin College, California
Polytechnical Institute, George Washington University, Oregon State
University, San Francisco State, Stanford University, UC Berkeley,
UC Santa Cruz, University of Miami and University of Oregon, have
established local service areas for their students, staff and
faculty.</p><p>In addition to service provided in big cities, schools and
airports, Metricom has teamed up with local utility companies to
provide coverage in smaller towns&mdash;systems are being installed in
Casper, Gillette, Laramie, Lander and Torrington in Wyoming and
Scottsbluff, Gering, Kearney, Alliance and McCook in Nebraska. The
nature of the Ricochet system allows Metricom to offer localized
service wherever there are enough users to support it&mdash;I have
visions of service in places like Durango, Colorado.</p><p>Remember the strange phone number? You can also enter the
serial number of another modem radio. If it's nearby and not
currently engaged, it will see a &ldquo;RING&rdquo; and the other user's
program can answer the phone. In this way a peer-to-peer service is
established between two modems.</p><p><a href="2493f3.jpg" target="_self">Figure 2. Map of Puget Sound
Coverage</a></p><p>There's another form of operation as well&mdash;called Star mode.
In normal mode, the modem acts like a Hayes-compatible modem; in
Star mode, the modem delivers packets into space (the original
ether) and other modems see these packets and deal with them in a
manner similar to an Ethernet card. This mode only works in
modem-to-modem communication; however, the greater bit capacity
makes it worth exploring. If you look in the Linux kernel
configuration, you'll find support for this mode is already
available. With this code compiled in, you and your co-workers and
friends can have your own wireless LAN wherever you go. It's very
convenient for conferences.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbaf580.0xca8478"></a>About The Laptop...</h2></div></div><p>I finally broke down and bought one. Naturally, it runs
Linux, and when I'm out of the office, I unplug the PCMCIA Ethernet
card and turn on the Ricochet modem.</p><p>When the microcell radios are installed, they're configured
with their latitude and longitude. One of the extra
<span   class="bold"><b>AT</b></span> commands causes the modem to
report the location and signal strength of up to ten nearby
microcell radios. I've wandered around Seattle getting these
reports and looking for microcell radios. I edited these reports
into the tms file cited in the URL above&mdash;that's how I built the
map.</p><p>Needless to say, I had to check out the roaming feature once
I got my laptop. As I drove around town, I issued a ping command
directed at my home system. Sometimes the latency was quite high,
but it also seemed to go down when a second ping was issued. I
suspect that routing tables are updated often enough that the
system quickly finds the best route. Now I've got to check it while
riding the ferry across Puget Sound.</p><p>Visit http://www.ricochet.net/ for more information.</p></div></div>
