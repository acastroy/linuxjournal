    Mr. Niederreiter tells us all about his graphical user
    interface for writing data to a CD-ROM.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d1580.0x26c9500"></a></h2></div></div><p>X-CD-Roast is a fully X-based CD writer
program. It is a front end for the command-line utilities
<span   class="bold"><b>cdwrite</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>mkisofs</b></span>. X-CD-Roast therefore
reduces the task of creating your own CDs to a few simple mouse
clicks instead of a long study of any command-line parameters.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d1580.0x26c96b8"></a>Feature List</h2></div></div><p>The newest version of X-CD-Roast (0.96a in August 1997)
provides the following features:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>point and click X11 interface</p></li><li><p>automatic IDE and SCSI hardware setup</p></li><li><p>copying of ISO-9660 CDs, non-ISO-9660 CDs (like Mac
or Sun CDs), Mixed-Mode CDs and Audio CDs.</p></li><li><p>mastering of ISO-9660-data CDs</p></li><li><p>creation of audio CDs</p></li><li><p>quick CD-to-CD copying (no need for a CD image
saved on hard disk)</p></li><li><p>soundcard support</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d1580.0x26c9ce8"></a>Limits</h2></div></div><p>At this time, it is not possible to create or copy
multi-session CDs with X-CD-Roast. You also cannot master a CD
without creating a CD image on a hard disk; you must provide the
disk space for the data and for the mastered CD-image. Therefore,
you need approximately 700MB times two of free disk space when
creating a 650MB CD. Version 0.96a supports only a very limited set
of CD writers. The next major update to 0.97 will include the
<span   class="bold"><b>cdrecord</b></span> program which will handle
most writers on the market. Non-SCSI writers will not be supported
in the near future.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d1580.0x26c9e48"></a>System Requirements</h2></div></div><p>Prior to the installation of X-CD-Roast you should check
whether you satisfy all system requirements.</p><p><a href="1341s1.html" target="_self">Required Hardware</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d1580.0x26ca000"></a>How Does It Work?</h2></div></div><p>First, the basic steps when burning a Data-CD: The copying is
very simple: first, an image of the original-CD is created on a
free hard disk partition (called &ldquo;image&rdquo; or &ldquo;image partition&rdquo;
from now on). This image contains every byte of the original CD and
can therefore be up to 650MB in size. Now, you can do a
verification run to compare the contents of the image with the
original CD. This enables you to track down any read errors that
might have damaged the image. The next step is to copy that image
back to a CD-Recordable, a process called &ldquo;burning&rdquo;. At this
point you can choose whether to simulate the burn process (the
writer goes through all the motions and processes, but the write
laser is off) or to do the real thing. I recommend that you do your
first tests using the simulation mode&mdash;it could save you a few
CD-Recordables.</p><p>Audio and mixed-mode CDs (CDs with one data track and
additional audio tracks) can be copied as well, but this takes more
effort. Each track of the original CD is read into a single file
and saved onto the image partition. These tracks can now be written
in any sequence you like, and you can also read tracks from more
than one CD and so create your own &ldquo;best-of&rdquo; audio CD.</p><p>If you want to create a CD with your own files, you must
first &ldquo;master&rdquo; the data. Collect all the files you wish to have
on CD in a single directory tree mounted on your system. X-CD-Roast
then converts this directory tree into a ISO-9660 CD image.
Remember, this image will occupy about the same amount of space on
your hard drive as your data to burn does. So, to master 600MB of
data, you must have about 1.2GB of space. Finally, you burn this
image on to a CD-Recordable.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d1580.0x26ca1b8"></a>What is a CD-Recordable?</h2></div></div><p>In this section I briefly explain how a CD-Recordable and a
CD writer work. This information is not necessary to use
X-CD-Roast, but it can help you to understand the process.</p><p>The most common types of CD-Recordables are those with 63 and
74 minutes audio runtimes or 553MB and 650MB data capacities. The
structure of a pressed &ldquo;silver&rdquo; CD is quite similar to a
CD-Recordable. A pressed CD is built from a polycarbonate layer in
which the information is pressed as pits. The sequence of &ldquo;pit&rdquo;
or &ldquo;not-pit&rdquo; represents the data on the CD. After the press
process, the layer is laminated with aluminum (giving it the silver
look) for better reflection of the reading laser of a CD-ROM
drive.</p><p>On the writable CD, the polycarbonate substrate, has a spiral
groove that helps the laser stay on course during burning and
playback. On that substrate a thin gold layer is laminated to
provide the best possible reflection to a reading laser. Over the
gold layer is a photosensitive dye layer, and over that is a clear
protective lacquer. While you use a weak laser to read a CD, you
need more power to write. The laser beam heats the photosensitive
layer and creates a kind of hole that shows us the gold layer. When
you read such a CD-Recordable, the holes in the photosensitive
layer can be interpreted as &ldquo;pits&rdquo;, making it possible to read
such a CD with all common CD-ROM and audio players. However, the
&ldquo;pits&rdquo; are not as sharp as on a pressed CD and can cause troubles
on a few older CD-ROM drives, which report occasional read errors,
while others perform flawlessly.</p><p>Some recommended precautionary measures when dealing with
CD-Recordables:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Label only on pre-marked label side using a soft,
felt tip marker.</p></li><li><p>Don't use stickers.</p></li><li><p>Store only in cool and dark places.</p></li></ul></div><p><a href="1341f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.

the newest version of X-CD-Roast. You can download it from
http://www.fh-muenchen.de/home/rz/xcdroast/. On this web page you
will also find the complete documentation and further information.
You can also get X-CD-Roast from
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/ and its mirrors. More
detailed information about installation and usage can be found in
the X-CD-Roast README file. In this article I discuss only the
basics.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d1580.0x26ca840"></a>First Steps</h2></div></div><p>At this point, I assume that you have installed X-CD-Roast
and connected all your necessary hardware correctly. Now start
X-CD-Roast as root, and you will be prompted to specify your
hardware settings.</p><p><a href="1341f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2. Title
screen</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d1580.0x26caa50"></a>The Setup Menu</h2></div></div><p>In this menu you specify all the hardware X-CD-Roast needs,
including your CD writer, the hard disk partition that will store
any CD images, your sound device and so on.</p><p>A screen shot showing an example setting for the CD devices
is shown in Figure 3. You can always use your CD writer to read
data or audio from a CD. It's not necessary to use an additional
CD-ROM drive as shown in Figure 3.</p><p><a href="1341f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3: Part
of the Setup Menu</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d1580.0x26cacb8"></a>Data CDs</h2></div></div><p>Use the Copy menu to copy pure data CDs. A data CD is a CD
containing only one track written in a certain file system. Usually
the file system ISO-9660 is used, but a few special file systems
like those from Sun or Apple can also be used. X-CD-Roast is able
to copy such a CD independent from the file system by doing a
byte-to-byte copy.</p><p>First, X-CD-Roast dumps the entire contents of a original CD
to the image partition on the hard disk. It is done in this
way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat /dev/sr0 &gt;/dev/sdb4
</pre><p>Note that any existing file system on that image partition is
overwritten by the CD image. Then, the image is burned to a
CD-Recordable using the cdwrite utility.
</p><p><a href="1341f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4. The
Copy CD Menu</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d1580.0x26c1860"></a>Audio and Mixed-Mode CDs</h2></div></div><p>When you wish to copy an audio CD (a music CD) or a
mixed-mode CD (a CD that contains one data track and some music
tracks), you must copy each track to a single file. X-CD-Roast is
equipped with a built-in player so you can listen to each track via
a sound card. You can read audio tracks in any sequence and from as
many CDs as you wish, as long you keep in mind that only about 74
minutes (or 63 minutes) fit on one CD-Recordable.</p><p>The reading of raw audio data from a CD is quite complicated.
X-CD-Roast does not simply play a track and record it
simultaneously via a sound card, but it does get the audio data via
the SCSI bus. X-CD-Roast includes a program
<span   class="bold"><b>cdda2cdr</b></span> which uses the generic
SCSI interface to request the audio data from a CD-ROM drive (or
the CD writer) and saves it raw to a file. After you have finished
reading in audio tracks, all audio files are burned with the
cdwrite utility to the CD-Recordable.</p><p>Additional information about the generic SCSI interface can
be found in the SCSI Programming HOWTO at
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/SCSI-Programming-HOWTO.</p><p><a href="1341f5.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 5.
Reading Audio Tracks from a Mixed-Mode CD</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d1580.0x26c1b78"></a>The Quick Copy Menu</h2></div></div><p>If you have a CD-ROM drive as well as a CD writer connected,
you can speed up the process of copying a data CD considerably. Put
the original CD in the CD-ROM drive and a CD-Recordable in the CD
writer, and X-CD-Roast will simultaneously read from the CD-ROM
drive and write to the CD writer. Thus, there is no need for an
image partition, and the time to copy a CD is halved. On the other
hand, this procedure can be quite risky. If your CD-ROM drive
provides the writer with the data too slowly, you can experience
buffer problems that result in a wasted CD-Recordable. For this
reason the CD-ROM should be twice as fast as the CD writer. Use
this feature with caution.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d1580.0x26c1c80"></a>The Master Menu</h2></div></div><p>If you want to create a CD using your own data, you have to
master the data. First you provide a directory tree that contains
all the files you wish to burn on a CD-Recordable. This tree can be
about 650MB large and mounted anywhere in your file system. (It can
even be on a NFS-exported directory.) Now, tell X-CD-Roast how to
master the data (see Figure 6) and specify a volume label and,
then, start the master process. All your files to burn are now
converted into an ISO-9660 CD image that can be burned on the CD as
the last step.</p><p>X-CD-Roast calls the utility program called mkisofs to do the
master job. How long the master process takes depends on the speed
of the hard disk, the speed of the processor and the available
memory. A 650MB image can be created within 10 minutes on a fast
Pentium, but a slower computer can take up to several hours to do
the same task. For more detailed information on mkisofs, please
consult the man page for this program.</p><p><a href="1341f6.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 6.

mind that X-CD-Roast is just a front end to a lot of utilities, and
at this time, is quite limited compared with the command-line
interface of those utilities. I will be developing new versions to
add new features such as multi-session on most writers, bootable
CD-support, mastering without image-creation on a hard disk and
more. Please also check out cdrecord, which can be found at
ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord. It is command-line based,
but supports a lot of CD writers. A future version of X-CD-Roast
will use cdrecord instead of the older cdwrite.</p><p>For more information about CD writing under Linux, consult
the documentation for X-CD-Roast, cdwrite, mkisofs and cdda2wav. I
thank all of the great people who put a lot of effort into coding
the basic utilities X-CD-Roast uses. Keep up the good work.</p><p>An older version of this article was first published in the
