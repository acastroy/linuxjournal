    Higher speed Internet connections are on the horizon with
    U.S. Robotics' XS modem and Rockwell International's
    K56Plus.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1204580.0x12fc3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Most of us are deeply concerned about the
speed of our Internet connections. As we browse ever more complex
and graphical pages on the World Wide Web, we often have time to
read the newspaper while waiting for the desired information to
appear on our screens. And we have all heard that our V.34 modems,
which can communicate at up to 33.6 thousand bits per second (Kbps)
are the final word in speed over our normal phone lines. The
technological advances which used to double our connection speeds
every few years have finally come to an end. So why are major modem
players like U.S. Robotics and Rockwell International announcing
new modems which can communicate at up to 56Kbps?
</p><p>A major shift in how the Public Switched Telephone Network
(PSTN) is constructed has taken place and has opened the door to
this latest increase in speed. For over 100 years the telephone
system was an incredibly complex analog switching system of
circuits connecting telephones to other telephones. Recently, the
PSTN was substantially upgraded to digital high-speed connections,
often carried over fiber-optic cables. This modern telephone
infrastructure can now be utilized for ever-higher data
speeds.</p><p>Also, a new method of data encoding has been developed and
will soon be available. This technology is called X2 by U.S.
Robotics and K56Plus by Rockwell International. The systems are
similar enough to be considered the same for the purpose of this
discussion, and I refer to both as 56Kbps technology. It remains to
be seen whether the implementations chosen by these two companies
will be compatible.</p><p>In order to explore this new technology, a little background
information on the public telephone system is in order. When you
place a call to another person you probably don't think about how
the connection is made. The telephone system is so reliable and
easy to use that any 5-year-old can easily place and receive calls.
Behind the scenes, however, is a very complex system of electronic
equipment which is not widely understood. Most connections today
are handled by digital switching equipment while almost all
residential telephones are still analog. In fact, your residential
line has changed little in the past 70 years. The changes have
occurred inside and between the Central Offices (COs). Normal
modems, including the latest 33.6Kbps models, assume they are
communicating over a connection that is completely analog. This
assumption is no longer always valid. There are still many analog
switches in use in the United States, especially in rural areas,
but they are being quickly upgraded to digital systems.</p><p>Your phone line is basically two copper wires which carry
current between your telephone and your CO. Your voice is
inherently analog, which means it is continuously variable and
contains an infinite number of discrete levels. Your telephone
converts your voice to fluctuations in the current carried over
your phone line. Upon receipt at the CO, however, a major change
occurs. Your phone line is connected to a piece of equipment which
converts analog signals to digital and digital signals to analog.
This equipment is called a <span   class="emphasis"><em>codec</em></span>, which stands
for COder/DECoder. After your voice has been converted to a digital
signal, it can be processed by the digital switching matrix in the
CO and transported over digital lines to another CO or to another
line in the same CO. Another codec converts this signal back to
analog fluctuations in current on the copper wires which lead to
another telephone. The other telephone then converts this current
into an audio signal which can be understood by a listener. A
similar process occurs going the other way, and you hear the other
person's voice, no matter how far away from you he may be.</p><p>This digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital conversion is
the area of interest to the designers of this new modem technology.
A coding standard has evolved in the United States, and similar
standards are in place in Europe and other parts of the world. The
analog signal is sampled 8000 times per second by the codec and
each sample generates an 8-bit byte of data, which can take on 256
distinct values from 0 to 255. These samples are taken
continuously, resulting in a stream of data which is 8,000 X 8 =
64,000 bits per second or 64Kbps. It is this data stream which
actually gets transported between COs and is usually combined
(&ldquo;multiplexed&rdquo;) into another, higher-speed, connection. For
example, 24 of these 64Kbps streams can be combined into one T1
line, which results in 1.544 million bits per second (Mbps). This
rate is greater than 24 X 64,000 because additional bits are used
for timing.</p><p>It is important to note that sampling is inherently
imperfect. The codec attempts to quantify an infinitely variable
signal into 256 discrete levels. Each of these levels is
necessarily a best estimate of the actual value. The error
introduced is called quantization noise and is measured in relation
to the desired signal in decibels (dB). This is known as a
signal-to-noise ratio. It is important to note that the
corresponding conversion of digital to analog does not cause
quantization noise since no error occurs: each of the 256 levels is
correctly translated to a distinct voltage.</p><p>Because the telephone system was designed for voice, it was
proper engineering practice to tailor the circuits to the
characteristics of the human voice. Almost all of the energy in a
human voice is contained in a band of frequencies from 300 Hertz to
3300 Hertz. (Hertz signifies cycles per second and is a measure of
frequency or pitch.) Thus, the telephone circuits have been limited
by design to this range of frequencies. This 3,000 Hertz range is
known at the <span   class="emphasis"><em>bandwidth</em></span> of the telephone
connection. It is this bandwidth which limits the speed at which
data can be transferred.</p><p>The recent development of V.34 modems makes maximum use of
this bandwidth and approaches the theoretical maximum speed of
33.6Kbps. This limit is due to quantization noise as discussed
above, and is determined by Shannon's Law. Shannon's Law defines
the maximum data rate over a connection as a function of the
connection's signal-to-noise ratio. This calculation is beyond the
scope of this discussion but results in a theoretical upper limit
of approximately 35Kbps for an analog phone line.</p><p>Now that we understand a little about the phone system, let's
look at what happens to data as it travels from your computer to a
local Bulletin Board System (BBS). Your data is born digital in
your computer and translated to analog by your modem. At the phone
company's Central Office, the analog signal is sampled and
converted to a digital stream. This digital stream is switched and
transported to the CO serving the BBS, where it is converted to
analog for the local loop serving the BBS. At the BBS modem, the
data is finally converted from analog to digital one last time, and
it can now be understood by the BBS computer. If you were following
closely, you noticed four separate conversions, two
analog-to-digital and two digital-to-analog. Remember, when an
analog-to-digital conversion takes place, quantization noise is
introduced.</p><p>Now we start to understand why our bandwidth is limited.
Recent technologies, such as ISDN (Integrated Services Digital
Network), can bring 64Kbps, or even 128Kbps, to our computers. But
ISDN requires expensive upgrades at the CO, and, therefore, much
higher monthly charges when compared to normal analog phone
service. 56Kbps technology requires no change to an already digital
CO.</p><p>The good news, and the enabling factor for the new 56Kbps
technology, is that most large service providers now use modems
which skip two of the above-mentioned conversions. Because these
service providers connect to the Central Office by way of digital
lines such as T1s (1.5Mbps) or T3s (45Mbps) and ISDN, digital
modems can be employed which do not need to translate data for
transport over an analog local loop from the service provider to
the CO. Here lies the secret behind 56Kbps technology. Recall that
quantization noise results from an analog-to-digital conversion. If
the service provider can avoid this conversion, the noise is not
introduced. Theoretically, if this conversion step is eliminated,
the entire 64Kbps data channel cad be exploited.</p><p>However, in the real world, only 128 of the possible 256
voltage levels will be used, resulting in 56Kbps transmission from
the service provider to the home. Notice that the analog to digital
conversion step from the home to the service provider has not been
eliminated and, therefore, no increase in speed is afforded in that
(upstream) direction, so standard V.34 33.6Kbps transmission
continues to be employed. This indicates that the 56Kbps technology
is asymmetrical in nature, resulting in different speeds in
different directions. Also note, 56Kbps technology will only work
when connecting to another modem which is served by a fully digital
connection&mdash;you will not be able to enjoy 56Kbps transfer speed
when calling your friend or a small bulletin board system. Normal
data compression techniques will still be used as they are today to
increase throughput. For example, a text file transmitted over a
56Kbps data link using V.42bis compression will result in a
transfer speed of 230.4Kbps. That is quite an improvement over
today's available transfer rates.</p><p>To wrap all this up, let's note a few important facts. A
service provider must have a fully digital connection to the
Internet, either T-carrier or ISDN. The service provider must have
56Kbps modems which are compatible with your modem. U.S. Robotics
announced the availability of X2 upgrades in January 1997, and
other modem manufacturers are expected to make upgrades available
sometime in the first quarter. Some modems will require only
software upgrades, while other modems will require hardware changes
or will not be upgradable at all. In general, a late-model modem
will be software upgradable if it uses FLASH ROM (the on-board
firmware can be upgraded without physical replacement of ROM
chips). As noted earlier, it is far from certain that the different
manufacturers' implementations of 56Kbps will be compatible, so
care must be taken to ensure your modem is using the same encoding
scheme as your service provider's modems.</p><p>Further information on 56Kbps technology can be obtained on
