    This article explains how kernel modules can add new binary
    formats to a system and show a pair of examples.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2932580.0x2a2a450"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of the roles that kernel modules can
accomplish is adding new binary formats to a running system. A
&ldquo;binary format&rdquo; is basically a data structure responsible for
executing program files&mdash;the ones marked with execute permission.
The code I'm going to introduce runs with version 2.0 of the
kernel.
</p><p>Kernel modules are meant to add new capabilities to a Linux
system, device drivers being the best known such &ldquo;capabilities&rdquo;.
As a matter of fact, the highly modular design of the Linux kernel
allows run-time insertion of many features other than device
drivers&mdash;we saw a few months ago how /proc files and
<span   class="bold"><b>sysctl</b></span> entry points can be created
by modularized code.</p><p>One other such loadable feature is the ability to execute a
binary format; this includes both executable files and shared
libraries. While the mechanism of loading compiled program files
and shared libraries is quite elaborate, the average Linux user can
easily add loaders that invoke an interpreter for new binary
formats. Thus, the user is able to call data files by name and have
them &ldquo;executed&rdquo;, after invoking <b  >chmod +x</b> on
the file.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2932580.0x2a2a6b8"></a>How a File Gets Executed</h2></div></div><p>Let's start this discussion by looking at how the
<span   class="bold"><b>exec</b></span> system call is implemented in
Linux. This is an interesting part of the kernel, as the ability to
execute programs is at the basis of system operations.</p><p>The entry point of exec lives in the architecture-dependent
tree of the source files, but all the interesing code is part of
fs/exec.c (all pathnames here refer to /usr/src/linux/ or the
location of your sources). To check architecture-specific details,
locate the function by typing the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
arch/*/kernel/*.c
</pre><p>Within fs/exec.c the toplevel function,
<span   class="bold"><b>do_execve()</b></span>, is less than fifty
lines of code in length. Its role is checking for errors, filling
the &ldquo;binary parameter&rdquo; structure (<b  >struct
linux_binprm</b>) and looking for a binary handler. The last
step is performed by
<span   class="bold"><b>search_binary_handler()</b></span>, another
function in the same file. The magic of
<span   class="bold"><b>do_execve()</b></span> is contained in this
last function which is very short. Its job consists of scanning a
list of registered binary formats, passing the
<b  >binprm</b> structure to all of them until one
succeeds. If no handler is able to deal with the executable file,
the kernel tries to load a new handler via
<span   class="bold"><b>kerneld</b></span> and scans the list once
again. If no binary format is able to run the executable file, the
system call returns the <b  >ENOEXEC</b> error code
(&ldquo;Exec format error&rdquo;).
</p><p>The main problem with this kind of implementation is in
keeping Linux compatible with the standard Unix behaviour. That is,
any executable text file that begins with <b  >#!</b>
must be executed by the interpreter it asks for, and any other
executable text is run by /bin/sh. The former issue is easily dealt
with by a binary format specialized in running interpreter files
(fs/binfmt_script.c), and the interpreter itself is run by calling
search_binary_handler() once again. This function is designed to be
reentrant, and binfmt_script checks against double invocation. The
latter issue is mainly an historical relic and is simply ignored by
the kernel. The program trying to execute the file takes care of
it. Such a program is usually your shell or
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span>. It's interesting to note
that while recent versions of
<span   class="bold"><b>gmake</b></span> execute properly when a
script has no leading <b  >#!</b> line, previous versions
didn't call a shell resulting in a &ldquo;cannot execute binary file&rdquo;
message when running unadorned scripts from within a
Makefile.</p><p>All the magic handling of data structures needed to replace
the old executable image with the new one is performed by the
specific binary loader, based on utility functions exported by the
kernel. If you would like to take a look at such code, the function
<span   class="bold"><b>load_out_binary()</b></span> in
fs/binfmt_aout.c is a good place to start&mdash;easier than the ELF
loader.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2932580.0x2a2adf0"></a>Registration of Binary Formats</h2></div></div><p>The implementation of <span   class="bold"><b>exec</b></span>
is interesting code, but Linux has more to offer: registration of
new binary formats at run time. The implementation is quite
straightforward, although it involves mucking with rather elaborate
data structures&mdash;either the code or the data structures must
accomodate the underlying complexities; elaborate data structures
offer more flexibility than elaborate code.</p><p>The core of a binary format is represented in the kernel by a
structure called <b  >struct&lt;\!s&gt;linux_binfmt</b>,
which is declared in the linux/binfmts.h file as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
struct linux_binfmt {
        struct linux_binfmt *next;
        long *use_count;
        int (*load_binary)(struct linux_binprm *,
                struct pt_regs *);
        int (*load_shlib)(int fd);
        int (*core_dump)(long signr,
                struct pt_regs *);
        };
</pre><p>The three functions, or &ldquo;methods&rdquo;, declared by the binary
format are used to execute a program file, to load a shared library
and to create a core file. The <b  >next</b> pointer is
used by search_binary_handler(), while the
<b  >use_count</b> pointer keeps track of the usage count
of modules. Whenever a process <b  >p</b> is executing in
the realm of a modularized binary format, the kernel keeps track of
<b  >*(p-&gt;binfmt-&gt;use_count)</b> to prevent
unexpected removal of the module.
</p><p>A module, then, uses the following functions to load and
unload itself:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
extern int register_binfmt(struct linux_binfmt *);
extern int unregister_binfmt(struct linux_binfmt *);
</pre><p>The functions receive a single argument instead of the usual
pointer,name pair because no file in the /proc directory lists the
available binary formats. The typical code for loading and
unloading a binary format, therefore, is as simple as the
following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
int init_module (void) {
  return register_binfmt(&amp;bluff_format);
}
void cleanup_module(void) {
  unregister_binfmt(&amp;bluff_format);
}
</pre>


The previous lines belong to the
<span   class="bold"><b>bluff</b></span> module (Binary Loader for an
Ultimately Fallacious Format), whose source is available for public
download from ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue45/2568.tgz.
</p><p>The structure representing the binary format can declare as
NULL any of the functions it offers; NULL functions are simply
ignored by the kernel. The easiest binary format, therefore, looks
like the following, which is the one used by the bluff
module:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
struct linux_binfmt bluff_format = {
        NULL, &amp;mod_use_count_, /* next, count */
        NULL, NULL, NULL    /* bin, lib, core */
};
</pre><p>Yes, <span   class="bold"><b>bluff</b></span>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a bluff; you can load and unload it at
will, but it does absolutely nothing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2932580.0x2a2b580"></a>The Binary Parameters</h2></div></div><p>In order to implement a binary format that is of some use,
the programmer must have some background information about the
arguments that are passed to the loading function, i.e.,
<b  >format-&gt;load_binary</b>. The first such argument
contains a description of the binary file and the parameters, and
the second is a pointer to the processor registers.</p><p>The second argument is only needed by
<span   class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> binary loaders, like the a.out and ELF
formats that are part of the Linux kernel sources. When the kernel
replaces an executable file with a new one, it must initialize the
registers associated with the current process to a sane state. In
particular, the instruction pointer must be set to the address
where execution of the new program must begin. The function
<span   class="bold"><b>start_thread</b></span> is exported by the
kernel to ease setting up the instruction pointer. In this article
I won't go so deep as to describe real loaders but will limit the
discussion to &ldquo;wrapper&rdquo; binary formats, similar to binfmt_script
and binfmt_java.</p><p>The <b  >linux_binprm</b> structure, on the other
hand, must be used even by simple loaders, so it is worth
describing here. The structure contains the following
fields:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >char buf[128]</b>: This buffer holds
the first bytes of the executable image. It is usually looked up by
each binary format in order to detect the file type. If you are
curious about the known magic numbers used to detect the different
file formats, you can look in the text file /usr/lib/magic
(sometimes called /etc/magic).</p></li><li><p><b  >unsigned long
page[MAX_ARG_PAGES]</b>: This array holds the addresses of
data pages used to carry around the environment and the argument
list for the new program. The pages are only allocated when they
are used; no memory is wasted when the environment and argument
lists are small. The macro <b  >MAX_ARG_PAGES</b> is
declared in the binfmts.h header and is currently set to 32 (128KB,
256KB on the Alpha). If you get the message &ldquo;<b  >Arg list too
long</b>&rdquo; when trying to run a massive grep, then you need
to enlarge <b  >MAX_ARG_PAGES</b>.</p></li><li><p><b  >unsigned long p</b>: This is a
&ldquo;pointer&rdquo; to data kept in the pages just described. Data is
pushed to the pages from high addresses to low ones, and
<b  >p</b> always points to the beginning of such data.
Binary formats can use the pointer to play with the initial
arguments that are passed to the program being executed, and I'll
show such use in the next section. It's interesting to note that
<b  >p</b> is a pointer to user-space addresses, and it
is expressed as <b  >unsigned long</b> to avoid an
undesired de-reference of its value. When an address represents
generic data (or an offset in the memory &ldquo;array&rdquo;) the kernel
often considers it a long integer.</p></li><li><p><b  >struct inode *inode</b>: This inode
represents the file being executed.</p></li><li><p><b  >int e_uid, e_gid</b>: These fields
are the effective user and group ID of the process executing the
program. If the program is
<span   class="bold"><b>set-uid</b></span>, these fields represent
the new values.</p></li><li><p><b  >int argc, envc</b>: These values
represent the number of arguments passed to the new program and the
number of environment variables.</p></li><li><p><b  >char *filename</b>: This is the full
pathname of the program being executed. This string lives in kernel
space and is the first argument received by the
<span   class="bold"><b>execve</b></span> system call. Although the
user program won't know its full pathname, the information is
available to the binary formats, so they can play games with the
argument list.</p></li><li><p><b  >int dont_iput</b>: This flag can be
set by the binary format to tell the upper layer that the inode has
already been released by the loader.</p></li></ul></div><p>The structure also contains other fields that are not
relevant to the implementation of simple binary formats. What is
relevant, on the other hand, are a pair of functions exported by
exec.c. The functions are meant to help the job of simple binary
loaders such as the ones I'll introduce in this article.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
unsigned long copy_strings(int argc,char ** argv,
        unsigned long *page, unsigned long p,
        int from_kmem);
void remove_arg_zero(struct linux_binprm *bprm);
</pre><p>The first function is in charge of copying
<b  >argc</b> strings, from the array
<b  >argv</b> into the pointer <b  >p</b> (a
user space pointer, usually <b  >bprm-&gt;p</b>). The
strings will be copied before the address pointed to by
<b  >p</b> (argument strings grow downwards). The
original strings, the ones in <b  >argv</b>, can either
reside in user space or in kernel space, and the array can be in
kernel space even if the strings are stored in user space. The
<b  >from_kmem</b> argument is used to specify whether
the original strings and array are both in user space (0), both in
kernel space (2) or the strings are in user space and the array in
kernel space (1). <span   class="bold"><b>remove_arg_zero</b></span>
removes the first argument from <b  >bprm</b> by
incrementing <b  >bprm-&gt;p</b>.

Images</h2></div></div><p>To turn the theory into sound practice, let's try to expand
our <span   class="bold"><b>bluff</b></span> into
<span   class="bold"><b>bloom</b></span> (Binary Loader for
Outrageously Ostentatious Modules). The complete source of the new
module is distributed together with bluff.</p><p>The role of bloom is to display executable images. Give
execution permission to your GIF images and load the module, then
call your image like it was a command, and
<span   class="bold"><b>xv</b></span> will display it.</p><p>This code is neither particularly original (most of it comes
from binfmt_script.c) nor particularly smart (text-only people like
me would rather use an ASCII viewer, for instance, and other people
prefer a different viewer). I feel this kind of example is quite
didactic anyway, and it can be easily run by anyone who can run an
X server and has root access to the computer in order to load
modules.</p><p>The source file is made up of little more than 50 lines and
is able to execute GIF, TIFF and the various PBM formats; needless
to say, you must give your images execute permissions
(<b  >chmod +x</b>) in advance. The viewer is
configurable at load time and defaults to /usr/X11R6/bin/xv. Here
is a sample session copied from my text console:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# insmod bloom.o
# ./snowy.tif
xv: Can't open display
# rmmod bloom
# insmod bloom.o viewer="/bin/cat"
# ./snowy.tif | wc -c
1067564
</pre><p>If you use the default viewer and work within a graphic
session, your image file will bloom on the display.
</p><p>If you can't wait to download the source file, you can see
the interesting part of bloom in Listing 1. Note that
<span   class="bold"><b>bloom.c</b></span> falls under the GPL,
because most of its code is copied from
<span   class="bold"><b>binfmt_script.c</b></span>.</p><p><a href="2568l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. The Core of
bloom.c</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2932580.0x2a236d0"></a>Registering the Format with
<span   class="bold"><b>kerneld</b></span></h2></div></div><p>The next question that I hear you ask is &ldquo;How can I set up
things so that <span   class="bold"><b>kerneld</b></span> can
automatically load my module?&rdquo;</p><p>Well, actually it isn't always possible. The code in
fs/exec.c only tries to use kerneld when at least one of the first
four bytes is not printable. This behaviour is meant to avoid
losing too much time with kerneld when the file being executed is a
text file without the <b  >#!</b> line. While real binary
formats have one non-printable byte in the first four, this isn't
always true for generic data types.</p><p>The net result of this behaviour is that you can't
automatically load the bloom viewer when invoking a GIF file or
when calling a PBM file by name. Both formats begin with a text
string and will therefore be ignored by the auto-loader.</p><p>When, on the other hand, the file has a non-printing
character within the first four, the kernel issues a kerneld
request for binfmt-number, where the exact string is generated by
this statement:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sprintf(modname, "binfmt-%hd",
        *(short*)(&amp;bprm-&gt;buf));
</pre><p>The ID of the binary format generated by the above statement
represents the first two bytes of the disk file. If you try to
execute TIFF files, kerneld looks for
<b  >binfmt-19789</b> or <b  >binfmt-18761</b>.
A gzipped file calls for <b  >binfmt--29921</b>
(negative). GIF files, on the other hand, are passed to /bin/sh
shell due to their leading text string. If you want to know the
number associated with each binary format, look in the
/usr/lib/magic file and convert the values to decimal.
Alternatively, you can pass the debug argument to kerneld and look
at its messages when you execute your data files and it tries to
load the corresponding binary format.
</p><p>It's interesting to note that kernel versions 2.1.23 and
newer switched to an easier and more significant ID by using the
following line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sprintf(modname, "binfmt-%04x",
              *(unsigned short *)(&amp;bprm-&gt;buf[2]));
</pre><p>This new ID string represents the third and fourth byte of
the binary file and is hexadecimal instead of decimal (thus leading
to strings with a better format and no ugly &ldquo;minus-minus&rdquo;
appearing now and then.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2932580.0x2a23ca8"></a>What's This Worth?</h2></div></div><p>While calling images by name can be funny, it has no real
role in a computer system. I personally prefer calling my viewer by
name, and I do not believe in the object-orientedness of the
approach. This kind of feature in my opinion is best suited to the
file manager where it can be tailored by appropriate configuration
files without introducing kernel bloat to lie in the way of any
computational path.</p><p>What <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> really interesting about binary
formats is the ability to run program files that don't fall in the
handy <b  >#!</b> notation. This includes executable
files belonging to other operating systems or platforms, as well as
interpreted languages that have not been designed for the Unix
operating system&mdash;all those languages that complain about a
<b  >#!</b> in the first line.</p><p>If you want to play one such game, you can try the
<span   class="bold"><b>fail</b></span> module. This &ldquo;Format for
Automatically Interpreting Lisp&rdquo; is a wrapper to invoke Emacs any
time a byte-compiled e-lisp program is invoked by name. Such
practice is definitely failure-prone, as it makes little sense to
invoke several megabytes of program code to run a few lines of
lisp. Moreover, Emacs-lisp is not suited to command-line handling.
Together with <span   class="bold"><b>fail</b></span> you'll also
find a pair of sample lisp executables to make your tests.</p><p>A real-world Linux system is full of interesting examples of
interpreted binary formats such as the Java binary format. Other
examples are the binary format that allows the Alpha platform to
run Linux-x86 binaries and the one included in recent DOSEMU
distributions that is able to run old DOS programs transparently
(although the program must be specifically tailored in
advance).</p><p>Version 2.1.43 of the kernel and newer ones include generic
support for interpreted binary formats.
<span   class="bold"><b>binfmt_misc</b></span> is somewhat like bloom
but much more powerful. You can add new interpreted binary formats
to the module by writing the relevant information to the file
/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc.</p><p>  Listing 1 and all other programs referred to in this
