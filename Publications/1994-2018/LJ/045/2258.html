    PVM is a software application that allows you to turn TCP/IP
    networked computers into a single virtual machine in order
    to run parallel programming.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bd9580.0x1cd13f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>PVM is free software which provides the
capability for using a number of networked (TCP/IP) machines as a
parallel virtual machine to perform tasks for which parallelism is
advantageous. We use PVM in one of our computer laboratories at
Eastern Washington University (EWU), mixing Linux and Sun machines
together, to comprise various virtual machines. PVM comes with a
rich selection of examples and tutorial material allowing a user to
reach a reasonable level of proficiency in a relatively short time.
There is no new programming language to learn, presuming one
already knows C, C++ or FORTRAN. With two or more Linux boxes
networked one can run PVM and investigate parallel programming.
With only one Linux box, one can still run applications and emulate
the parallelism.
</p><p>PVM was developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory in
conjunction with several universities, principal among them being
the University of Tennessee at Knoxville and Emory University. The
original intent was to facilitate high performance scientific
computing by exploiting parallelism whenever possible. By utilizing
existing heterogeneous networks (Unix at first) and existing
software languages (FORTRAN, C and C++), there was no cost for new
hardware and the costs for design and implementation were
minimized.</p><p>A typical PVM consists of a (possibly heterogeneous) mix of
machines on the network, one being the &ldquo;master&rdquo; host and the rest
being &ldquo;worker&rdquo; or &ldquo;slave&rdquo; hosts. These various hosts
communicate by message passing. The PVM is started at the command
line of the master which in turn can spawn workers to achieve the
desired configuration of hosts for the PVM. This configuration can
be established initially via a configuration file. Alternatively,
the virtual machine can be configured from the PVM command line
(master's console) or during run time from within the application
program.</p><p>A solution to a large task, suitable for parallelization, is
divided into modules to be spawned by the master and distributed as
appropriate among the workers. PVM consists of two software
components, a resident daemon
(<span   class="bold"><b>pvmd</b></span>) and the PVM library
(<span   class="bold"><b>libpvm</b></span>). These must be available
on each machine that is a part of the virtual machine. The first
component, pvmd, is the message-passing interface between the
application program on each local machine and the network
connecting it to the rest of the PVM. The second component, libpvm,
provides the local application program with the necessary
message-passing functionality, so that it can communicate with the
other hosts. These library calls trigger corresponding activity by
the local pvmd which deals with the details of transmitting the
message. The message is intercepted by the local pvmd of the target
node and made available to that machine's application module via
the related library call from within that program.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bd9580.0x1cd16b8"></a>Obtaining and Learning to Use PVM</h2></div></div><p>The PVM home page is at
http://www.epm.ornl.gov/pvm/pvm_home.html. From there one can
download the PVM software, obtain the tutorial, get current PVM
news, etc. The software, tarred and zipped, only comprises about
600KB. The README file found therein is sufficient to get up and
running, but the value of the tutorial must be stressed. The
tutorial can be downloaded from the PVM home page and is also
available in book form.</p><p>With the tutorial as guide, one can work through the
selection of examples packaged with the software. The example
source files are well documented internally so that one can become
comfortable with the usual PVM library calls. The tutorial has a
very nice chapter explaining each of the library calls clearly and
in detail. This process was essentially how we started using PVM at
EWU.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bd9580.0x1cd1818"></a>Our Experience</h2></div></div><p>The network we used at EWU has a variety of machines,
architectures and Unix flavors. The first challenge was learning
how to configure such a mix of machines to form a PVM. It becomes
less straightforward as the heterogeneity increases with the
complicating factor being the diverse Unix flavors. One of the
methods for configuring a PVM uses the Unix
<span   class="bold"><b>rsh</b></span> (remote shell) command. This
relies on the existence of a .rhosts file on the target machine.
From the master one starts the PVM daemon (pvmd) on a slave in
order to incorporate the slave into the virtual machine&mdash;the master
uses rsh to do this. However, the target (slave) machine only
allows the master access if the master is listed in the target's
.rhosts file. The various flavors of Unix do not agree in the finer
details for the syntax of the .rhosts file, nor could we always
find pertinent documentation. There are several other methods for
configuring PVM and, in most cases, we found it a black art.
Nevertheless, we persevered and documented our experience on an
embryonic web site for a PVM WebCourse
(http://knuth.sirti.org/cscdx/) for those who discover similar
problems.</p><p>It is instructive to look at an example (see Listings 1 and
2) to get the flavor of the programming. The executable for the
source in <a href="2258l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> is started at
the command line of the master host which, in turn, spawns the
second executable on a slave. For simplicity, no error checking is
included. However, PVM provides easy ways to check for failure on
such library calls as <span   class="bold"><b>pvm_spawn</b></span>.
The example, adapted from one in the tutorial, merely measures the
time it takes for a simple interchange of passed messages, master
to slave and slave to master. In particular, the master sends an
array to the slave, the slave doubles each of the elements and
sends it back. The master prints out the initial array, the final
array and the array's round trip time.</p><p><a href="2258l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>PVM has found a regular place in our curriculum. It provides
a way to investigate parallel programming in an inexpensive yet
realistic way. Thinking through an involved parallel-programming
exercise is a new and sometimes difficult evolution for those
accustomed only to sequential programming. Once the students have
worked through the tutorial material, they move on to problems in
which they take a design role and, finally, to substantive
projects.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bd9580.0x1cd1b88"></a>The Future of PVM</h2></div></div><p>Although PVM rather quickly became a de facto standard,
critics pointed out that in actuality there was no formal, enforced
standard. It was also clear that the message passing was slower
than optimized protocols native to an architecture. Very soon after
the spread of PVM, a standard was put forward called MPI, the
Message-Passing Interface. MPI has advantages (e.g., faster message
passing, a standard) and disadvantages (e.g., not interoperable
among heterogeneous architectures, not dynamically reconfigurable)
with respect to PVM. PVMPI is a newer project which will combine
the virtues of both approaches. The success of this project
together with any standardization efforts of PVMPI may determine
the future viability of PVM.</p><p><a href="2258s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
