Java with Java DataBase Connectivity (JDBC) is
very hot. This Art Taylor book, published by Informix
Press/Prentice Hall, is rich with content and worthy of more
careful study by anyone but the most astute Java professional
working with JDBC.</p><p>True to its cover, Taylor's book features:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A tutorial and reference in one volume</p></li><li><p>Examples of every key JDBC method</p></li><li><p>CD-ROM containing JDBC/ODBC drivers from
Intersolv</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>JDBC Developer's Resource</em></span> also comes
very close to being &ldquo;Everything a developer needs to build
database-enabled Java applications.&rdquo; Not reported on the cover,
but inside, are examples of two and three-tiered applications. The
JDBC tutorial offers a hands-on, step-by-step approach to
implementing the power of JDBC, that is not for those afraid of
getting their hands dirty in properly commented code. The one
buzzword missing from the cover is &ldquo;practical&rdquo;--it is a practical
book, and its &ldquo;Quick Reference&rdquo; enforces that impression.</p><p>Generally speaking, I like the book. In fact, I was asked to
review it, because I am very involved in database design and am a
systems and software engineer. Currently, about 90% of the code I
write is for server-side Java applications for the Internet. About
99% of these applications use some kind of database back end. Of
these, I'd guess that 75-85% use the JDBC-ODBC Bridge. While these
relational database management systems (RDBMS) may not be as
exciting to me as object-oriented database management systems
(ODBMS) with native Java bindings, they are by far the largest
contingent of installed systems. It is this portion of the database
world addressed by JDBC.</p><p>The content of this book addresses the many issues
surrounding implementation of JDBC in Java applications by
providing many excellent, working examples through a logically
structured presentation of information. It starts with basics and
develops into a number of higher level concepts. It even has a
brief SQL introduction for newcomers to RDBMS. I am not overly fond
of the graphical layout of this manuscript, but I consider layout
to be a matter of personal taste rather than a design flaw. Many
code samples feature black ink on a rather dark gray background.
The included CD-ROM features a number of cool goodies including a
collection of drivers from Intersolv.</p><p>In a classroom grading scale, I'd give it a B+ for content
and structure, and a C+ for presentation. I'd give the JDBC quick
reference guide an A-. Would I buy this book? Based on the content,
I'd certainly buy it, but while shopping for a book, I'd look at
other books on the shelf for matching content with a better visual
appeal to me. If you're new to JDBC and want a quality tutorial,
buy this book.</p><p><a href="2366s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
