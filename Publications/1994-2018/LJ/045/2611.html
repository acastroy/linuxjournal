the letters.</p><p>John Barnitz wrote that he has problems with up and

the power-saving settings.</p><p>Are Tysland wrote of problems with

<span   class="bold"><b>sudo</b></span> for a while, but now I am
using <span   class="bold"><b>su1</b></span> (also on sunsite). Using
sudo, it is only possible to allow or disallow a command for a user
or a specified group of users. With su1 you can control the
parameters, e.g., user A can only mount CDs while user B or group B
can mount disks. You can control nearly every parameter and command
with this tool. I don't believe in a separate group for su users
because you have to switch the group before using it. If you don't
switch back after using su, you will probably have a
problem.</p><p>&mdash;Martin Fuerstenau, Bilm,

Owen in the July 1997 <i  >LJ</i>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Registering in the U.S. Domain (For Free)</em></span>.
Using Mr. Owen's carefully spelled out procedures, I tried to
register a domain with the berkeley.ca.us &ldquo;delegated authority&rdquo;,
Cliff Frost cliff@ack.berkeley.edu. The response was totally
underwhelming, and months later I still do not have my requested
domain registered.</p><p>This whole US domain registration system seems to be
operating at the level of the US Postal Service. (Hmm. Wait, that's
uncharitable. The USPS is a whiz in comparison to these
characters.)</p><p>For example, this morning I went to the page:
http://www.isi.edu/us-domain/ and tried to use the web-based
registration form, since the Berkeley delegated authority is not
responding to me. Clicking on the &ldquo;Web Based Registration
Template&rdquo; and arriving at the URL:
http://www.isi.edu/cgi-bin/usdomreg/template.pl, I got a &ldquo;Not
Found&rdquo; message.</p><p>It appears that the San Jose, CA delegated authority that R.
K. Owen used is better organized. I hope your other readers have
better luck using the article's procedures than I did.</p><p>Keep the good stuff flowing from <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>&mdash;Robert Lynch rmlynch@best.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24c9580.0x25c19d0"></a>E-mail Correction</h2></div></div><p>The October issue is great, but there is a small error&mdash;my

of Alpha Chip Family&rdquo;. [<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux and the Alpha</em></span>,
David Mosberger]</p><p>David Mosberger surprised me when he stated in the Alpha
article that gettimeofday() &ldquo;returns the current real time at a
resolution of typically one timer tick (about one millisecond on
the Alpha)&rdquo;. The gettimeofday() API allows a resolution of one
microsecond, and Linux on the i386 gives you that (courtesy of a
hardware counter that is incremented at approximately one
megahertz). A quick look at the 2.0.29 kernel sources
(arch/*/kernel/time.c) suggests to me that gettimeofday() gives you
high resolution on the i386, m68k, mips and ppc, but not on the
Alpha or SPARC. Are there plans to fix this inequity?</p><p>&mdash;James R. Van Zandt jrv@vanzandt.mv.com</p><p>No, it's not. Correct table is printed below.</p><p>I think you raise three different questions:&lt;\n&gt;1. What
does _typical_ resolution mean?2. Would gettimeofday() with one
microsecond be sufficient for the kinds ofmeasurements I wanted to
discuss?3. Will Linux/Alpha support resolutions finer than 1 clock
tick?</p><p>The answers:</p><p>1.To user X, &ldquo;typical&rdquo; is what user X happens to own, I
suppose. Seriously though, the traditional gettimeofday()
implementation provided timer-tick resolution. The API obviously
always has allowed for up to microsecond resolution, but that's not
relevant for actual implementations. If you're writing a portable
program, you cannot rely on gettimeofday() returning better than
timer-tick resolution, hence my claim of this being
&ldquo;typical&rdquo;.</p><p>2. One microsecond resolution is far from sufficient for
modern CPUs. Even on a (relatively slow) 200MHz P6 this would
correspond to 200 cycles, so it would not be possible to measure
low-level events such as primary cache-misses. Even if the
resolution were sufficient, keep in mind that getimeofday()
typically involves a system call. For example, on a 200MHz P6, it
appears to take on the order of four microseconds just to execute a
pair of gettimeofday() calls. In summary, there are plenty of
scenarios where a CPU cycle counter is advantageous over
gettimeofday(). Of course, the converse is also true. What I'm
saying is that both techniques have their place for the time
being.</p><p>3. I don't know. 2.1.xx may already do that, but I haven't
had a chance to keep track of recent kernel development.</p><p>&mdash;David Mosberger davidm@azstarnet.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24c9580.0x25c28f0"></a>I2O and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Stop the
Presses</em></span></h2></div></div><p>I have just read Phil Hughes' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Stop the
Presses</em></span> in the October issue of <i  >LJ</i>.
Being a manufacturer of intelligent multiport cards, Cyclades has
been following I2O for a while.</p><p>I2O has been around for a few years now. It started to gain
momentum only this year, due to the persistence of Intel. SCO,
Microsoft and Novell seem to be going to support it. At this point,
there are no real implementations of I2O, and the standards are
only now becoming stable. I have doubts whether this will actually
become real or not. The idea of a standard architecture is good,
but I2O is a very heavy interface designed to sell Intel
processors.</p><p>Besides the fact that you have to pay to get the specs (not
necessarily bad, PCI does the same thing), there is another catch.
The I2O specs were designed so that there is only one possible CPU
to be used on a I2O card: the Intel 960RP. More, only Wind River
(working with Intel) has a software implementation of I2O
messaging. Intel bundles a runtime license of IxWorks (the RTOS
that runs the I2O messaging inside the board) with every
960RP.</p><p>Thus, I2O is not an &ldquo;open&rdquo; standard. It is an attempt by
Intel to standardize intelligent I/O around the Intel 960RP and
Wind River's IxWorks.</p><p>With I2O gaining some momentum, other hardware companies (PLX
is one of them) are designing PCI chips compliant with I2O
messaging. But, still, the choices are limited, and the viability
of I2O is still to be verified.</p><p>Phil also mentioned the &ldquo;Open Hardware&rdquo; initiative.
Cyclades was the first company to certify products for Open
Hardware and is, still, the only one.</p><p>&mdash;Marcio Saito, Cyclades
