is written toward the technically oriented and somewhat Unix aware?
If so, <span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX for the Hyper-Impatient</em></span> may be
worth your consideration.</p><p>The book is actually a hypertext repackaging of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX for the Impatient</em></span>, Second Edition. The
content of the original book contained many internal cross
references and pointers to related information. I believe the
existence of these &ldquo;links&rdquo; is one of the reasons the book was
released in an all-electronic hypertext format. There seems to be
little difference between the content of the electronic and hard
copy versions of the book.</p><p>The book is organized functionally and divided into fourteen
chapters and six appendices. You might want to read the
Introduction and Concept chapters sequentially. Then again, you may
find yourself randomly skipping in and out of the other chapters.
Chapters 3, 4 and 5 are functionally arranged to answer the
question &ldquo;What command(s) can I use to ___&rdquo; (you fill in the
blank). Chapter 3 focuses on operations that may be performed on
files. Chapter 4 addresses data manipulation using filter commands.
Chapter 5 discusses utility programs used to monitor and manage
your Unix environment. Titles of the remaining chapters include
Chapter 6 &ldquo;The KORN and POSIX Shells&rdquo;, Chapter 7 &ldquo;Other
Shells&rdquo;, Chapter 8 &ldquo;Standard Editors&rdquo;, Chapter 9 &ldquo;The GNU Emacs
Editor&rdquo;, Chapter 10 &ldquo;Emacs Utilities&rdquo;, Chapter 11 &ldquo;Mailers and
Newsreaders&rdquo;, Chapter 12 &ldquo;Communicating with Remote Computers&rdquo;,
Chapter 13 &ldquo;The X Window System&rdquo; and Chapter 14 &ldquo;Managing Your
System&rdquo;. The Appendix contains an Alphabetical Summary of
Commands, Comparison of MS-DOS and Unix, a Resource list, a
Glossary and an Index.</p><p>Chapters 6 through 14 are largely factual in nature. These
chapters often state the basic facts, concepts and identify the
relevant files. To me, these chapters seem to present the &ldquo;what&rdquo;,
&ldquo;where&rdquo; and a little of the &ldquo;why&rdquo; of the selected topic. An
example of this approach is the X chapter, which opens with an
explanation of what the X Window System is and what it does for
you. It continues by describing how the various parts of X look and
what they do. This chapter then describes the high level flow of
events that initiate an X session, including the role the X
initialization files play in the initialization process.
Descriptions often contain information as to why one would be
interested in the particular X file, or would want to use the
particular X feature or function being discussed. This chapter on X
is a complete walk through the X environment, files and file
contents. From a user's perspective, few stones have been left
unturned. This type of reference would have saved me a lot of angst
when I encountered my first X environment.</p><p>The Alphabetical Summary of Commands is divided into an
alphabetical listing and a summary of the commands. There are two
hypertext links for each command in the alphabetical listing. One
link jumps to a summary of the command and the other jumps to a
detailed explanation of the command. The command summary provides
the level of detail I associate with O'Reilly's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux</em></span> (or <span   class="emphasis"><em>Unix</em></span>)
<span   class="emphasis"><em>in a Nutshell</em></span> book. Detailed command
explanations are well written descriptions that include
examples.</p><p>Addison-Wesley's web site provides access to the preface of
this book. Reading the on-line preface will give you a feel for
reading an entire book on-line. It is also a good example of the
authors' style.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc0f580.0xd07d98"></a>The Hypertext Browser</h2></div></div><p>A product called DynaText displays the hypertext book and
provides the user interface (see Figure 1, Reader Window). In
addition to the expected read, browse, search and print functions,
DynaText provides the user with the ability to define his own
bookmarks, notes, and cross references. A journal feature allows
the user to record and retrace his path through a series of
topics.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2400f1.large.jpg"><img src="2400f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Reader Window
</p></div></div><p>About ten short pages describe how to use the DynaText
software and supply the meaning of the various icons. The DynaText
on-line User's Guide is also useful, as some of the interface
features work a bit differently than what you might expect. For
example, the &ldquo;Bookmark&rdquo; button remains greyed out&mdash;until you
actually highlight some text. Clicking on the active Bookmark
button produces a dialog box to record your bookmark. The button
greys out again after the bookmark is defined. The same process is
true for the &ldquo;Notes&rdquo; button. User-specified names are assigned to
bookmarks and notes at the time of creation. DynaText did not allow
me to use the same name for a bookmark and a note I associated with
it. Buttons on the tool bar are nice, yet I got more utility out of
the bookmark and notes accelerator keys. The appropriate
&ldquo;Annotation Manager&rdquo; menu option must be used to access any
user-created bookmarks or notes.</p><p>Most of the hypertext links are colored green and quite
obvious. These green hypertext links may be a title, a Chapter
section number, a page number or an Appendix reference number.
Another set of hypertext links is indicated with one of several
icons. A third type of hypertext link presents no immediate visual
indication of its existence. If a pointing finger cursor appears
when you place the cursor over a word, then there is an active
hypertext link. This style of a hypertext link is used with
glossary words. Clicking on any one of these hypertext links opens
another window containing the referenced content.</p><p>Every predefined hypertext link opens a new window. This
technique makes it easy to see text at both the point of origin and
destination. On the other hand, this technique can quickly cause
the screen to become cluttered with windows. With several windows
open, I found it difficult for me to tell which window belonged to
which hyperlink jump.</p><p>Considering the keyword search capability of the browser, I
was disappointed not to find an accelerator key that placed the
cursor into the on-screen search field. I found one other search
characteristic annoying. The browser left the search word in the
search field upon completion of the search. Since each jump opens a
new window, as soon as a new window opened, the browser would
search for the word in the previous window's search field. I
received several &ldquo;not found&rdquo; dialog boxes that I had to clear
after making a jump.</p><p>A VCR style button panel is used to represent the
&ldquo;Journal&rdquo;. A Journal is created by clicking on the &ldquo;Record&rdquo;
button and navigating through the book. There is no need to worry
about wrong turns or jumps. The Copy, Paste and Cut buttons allow
you to re-sequence or remove topics. You can even add topics you
may have missed. Once established, this journal may then be used to
retrace the same path or to guide another person through the same
set of topics. There are two journal playback modes: continuous and
frame by frame. Out of the box, the continuous playback interval is
set to three seconds, but can be adjusted. Frame by frame uses the
VCR fast forward and reverse buttons to page forward or page
backward, one page at a time. The VCR panel is a bit large for my
tastes. I found myself moving it around the screen to get it out of
the way while recording and during the playback.</p><p>If you do not feel the predefined links meet your needs, you
can add your own one- or two-way hyperlink to the book. A hyperlink
simply jumps from one book location to another. Creating a user
hyperlink is as simple as marking text at the starting point, the
ending point, indicating one- or two-way link and naming the link.
A user-created hyperlink does not open a new window. This type of
link jumps directly, within the same window, to the destination
point. As with Bookmarks and Notes, you may have to use the
Annotation Manager to locate user-created hyperlinks.</p><p>Printing excerpts produced some odd results. I selected two
short chapter topics to print (Chapter 6.5 and 13.1). Each of these
sections happens to have a &ldquo;Page Icon&rdquo; on it. These sections were
printed across two pages. The first few lines of the section were
printed on one page and the remainder was printed on another page.
Several words were dropped from the sentence split between the two
pages. Selections and chapter sections did not contain a Page Icon
printed as expected.</p><p><a href="2400s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc0f580.0xd08370"></a>Where does one go for help?</h2></div></div><p>I had a Win95 installation glitch that did not make sense.
The hypertext links would not display properly. A large majority of
the hypertext links kept appearing as a green &ldquo;fred.&rdquo; I repeated
the installation a couple of times to make sure I wasn't missing
anything in the instructions. (Yes, I really do read them.) After a
couple of reinstalls the glitch remained, and it was time to seek
assistance.</p><p>The book's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Installation and User's Guide</em></span>
published the e-mail address help@qsep.com for installation
assistance along with a voice and a FAX number. A Web search for
Quickscan produced a web site hit (http://www.qsep.com/). I was
unable to reach any of these choices. I later learned that QSEP was
having major difficulties with their web server and support line at
the time I was reviewing this product. Prior to making contact with
QSEP I had stumbled my way through the hyperlink display glitch by
installing the program to run directly from the CD-ROM. It seems a
couple of other people encountered a similar symptom. Not having
had a chance to work through this problem directly with QSEP, I am
unable to comment on their quality or level of support.</p><p>Buried in Addison-Wesley's list of titles for Mr. Abraham's
web page is a URL pointing to browser update information
(http://www.qsep.com/unixbook.htm). Other than this URL, I was
unable to locate any form of software support for this specific
title on the Addison-Wesley web site. I did locate an &ldquo;Ask/Tell
Us&rdquo; web page that provided the means for sending Addison-Wesley a
comment and the ability to indicate the comment was technical
support related. While Addison-Wesley maintains a link to QSEP, I
would not count on Addison-Wesley for <span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX for the
Hyper-Impatient</em></span> technical support.</p><p>Inso Corporation's technical support for DynaText is password
protected and specifically directed toward individuals who have
purchased the DynaText product directly from Inso, or have
purchased a maintenance contract. Inso clearly states that persons
who are seeking DynaText support and did not buy it directly from
Inso need to contact the &ldquo;third party&rdquo; vendor who sold them the
DynaText-based product. I was also informed that any of the updated
browsers would have to come from the &ldquo;third party&rdquo; vendor as
well. So it seemed one can't even get a copy of the browser's
current release from Inso. In spite of Inso's &ldquo;We didn't sell you
the product so don't ask us for the latest browser policy,&rdquo; Inso
was very helpful. They provided prompt responses to any question
regarding DynaText product plans and Unix OS compatibility.</p><p><a href="2400s2.html" target="_self">Supported Operating
Systems</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc0f580.0xd086e0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>I liked the book's no nonsense approach and content. Each
chapter seems to be focused on &ldquo;What do I need to know to do this
task.&rdquo; Whenever I read a book, I'm always making notes and
inserting cross references and notes of my own. This book is rich
with internal cross references and footnotes.</p><p>I'm not really sure about the DynaText browser though. The
lack of a supported Linux browser for this review was
disappointing. I did have limited access to an AIX 4.1 client
machine. That avenue of review was a dead end as well, since the
browser for AIX 4.1 was still in the works. I would have liked to
see how the DynaText product behaved in a supported X or Common
Desktop Environment. Before purchasing this CD-ROM, I'd suggest
checking the above sites to verify that there is an available
DynaText browser for your flavor and version of Unix. Downloading a
browser could be a lengthy endeavor. One browser reference
indicated it was close to 17MB.</p></div></div>
