If knowing what the weather is gets your blood pumping and your heart
racing, you need to get wview and hook it up to your other
great passion, which is, of course, Linux.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2973580.0x2a6b250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Are you fascinated with weather? Do you often find yourself
checking local weather conditions? Is the weather your favorite part
of the news broadcast? If so, you may be a weather geek, and wview may
be the application for you.
</p><p>
wview is an open-source weather application that retrieves sensor
readings from a weather station. The sensor data is stored in SQLite3
databases. Aggregate data, such as minimums, maximums and averages,
are computed and stored in the database back end. Optional uses of
the stored data include weather Web site generation; generic file
generation for external applications; data submission to third-party
organizations, including Citizen Weather Observer Program (CWOP) and
Weather Underground; and store-forward to remote data collection centers.
A user-friendly HTML interface is provided for configuring your
weather station as well as for optional features.
</p><p>
To set up your weather station and publish your data with wview,
you need a weather station. Supported stations include Davis
Vantage Pro/Pro2 (Figure 1) or Vantage Vue, Texas Weather Instruments, Vaisala
WXT510/520, Oregon Scientific WMR9X8 and La Crosse WS-23XX. Next, you
need a platform to host the wview application. Desktop computers
of any vintage work well, but it often is desirable to host wview on a
low-power, unattended system. The now discontinued Linksys NSLU2 has
been a popular choice. The new SheevaPlug quickly is gaining popularity
as a wview host also. Industrious people even have used a Western Digital
Worldbook NAS as their wview host. Because wview is modular and designed
for embedded applications, it can be hosted on low-horsepower systems.
</p><p>
Next, you need to install a Linux distribution of your choice.
The Debian (and derivatives) wview packages provide the most idiot-proof
installation path, but source installs also are straightforward for any
Linux distribution. 
</p><p>
Finally, you need an interface cable. This may
be a simple 9-pin serial cable or perhaps a USB-serial adapter if your
host has no serial ports.

Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
To configure wview, open your favorite browser and
point it to the wview management Web site, typically
http://[your_wview_server]/wviewmgmt/login.php. An HTTP server
is required on the wview host (this will be installed automatically if you
use the APT packages). Use the default administration password
&ldquo;wview&rdquo;
(you can change this later). After logging in successfully, the System Status
page is displayed (Figure 2). The System Status page displays the current state
of all wview services as well as other status information.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10782f2.large.jpg"><img src="10782f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. System Status
</p></div></div><p>
Configuration is broken up into logical sections with context-sensitive
help available by mousing over the configuration items. Click the
Station tab to configure the station parameters (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10782f3.large.jpg"><img src="10782f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Station Configuration
</p></div></div><p>
The critical parameters here are the station type and the interface
characteristics. Select Save Changes when you are done. Next, click
the Services tab (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10782f4.large.jpg"><img src="10782f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Services Configuration
</p></div></div><p>
This page provides the configuration of wview services, log verbosity for
the services and e-mail alerts. Services available are File Generation,
Alarms, CWOP, HTTP (Weather Underground and Weatherforyou), File Export
(SSH or FTP) and Process Monitoring. For now, let's not enable any
additional services until you have confirmed your station interface.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2973580.0x2a6bf08"></a>
Station Confirmation</h2></div></div><p>
Now, let's proceed to the station interface verification. Open a shell on
the system that is running wview, so you can follow updates to the system log.
At the prompt, enter the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
</pre>
</p><p>
This displays new system log messages as they are generated. Here, you 
will monitor wview startup and status messages. Open another shell, and
execute the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo /etc/init.d/wview stop
$ sudo /etc/init.d/wview start
</pre>
</p><p>
You will see a flurry of activity in the system log from the wview
processes as they start up. It is a good idea to familiarize yourself
with these wview log messages, as a wealth of detail is included
that can be very helpful.
</p><p>
Return to the System Status page and observe the status of the station
interface and the file generation. If both are not status
&ldquo;green&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Running&rdquo;, further investigation in the system log file will be
required to find any configuration or station interface issues.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2973580.0x2a6c278"></a>
Default Web Site</h2></div></div><p>
If all is well, you now can view the default wview weather site. This is
typically found at http://[your_server_url]/weather/index.html (Figure 5).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10782f5.large.jpg"><img src="10782f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Default Web Site
</p></div></div><p>
Current conditions are given in the table on the left and by the dials in
the center and on the right. These values are updated every time station data is polled
(default is 30 seconds). The weather site pages are regenerated every
60 seconds (configurable). Observing changes in the current conditions
is an easy way to confirm proper station interface operation.
</p><p>
Historical data for the last 24 hours are presented as graphs. Graphs of
the last 24 hours, the last 7 days, the last 28 days and the last 365
days are available on other site pages.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2973580.0x2a6c5e8"></a>
Citizen Weather Observer Program (CWOP)</h2></div></div><p>
CWOP is a system
by which individuals with weather stations and the proper software can
submit their weather data to an APRS-based data storage system, so that
others, including NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration),
can use the data however they see fit. There are
some really neat station display Web sites, including some Java apps to
look up station data, position, maps and so on.
See <a href="http://www.findu.com/cgi-bin/wxpage.cgi?call=CW4097" target="_self">www.findu.com/cgi-bin/wxpage.cgi?call=CW4097</a>
for an example weather station.
</p><p>
CWOP participation requires registering for an APRS callsign. Once
you have configured wview for CWOP properly and confirmed your data
on-line, you must contact the maintainers via e-mail to confirm your
registration. Then your data will be available for anyone to see and
possibly be used in NOAA forecast models and so on.
</p><p>
When CWOP support is enabled and configured properly, wview transmits
a new WX packet to the APRS server every ten minutes, based on the last
digit of your callsign.
</p><p>
wview supports the APRS-IS Rollover (Automatic Packet Reporting System-Internet Service)
functionality by enforcing the definition of three APRS-IS server:port
pairs. The
goal is to avoid data
loss to the CWOP system caused by connection errors. Select three different
servers from the list at <a href="http://www.wxqa.com/activecwd.html" target="_self">www.wxqa.com/activecwd.html</a>.
</p><p>
Click the Services tab and enable CWOP submission and CWOP verbose
logging. Click Save Changes. Next, click the CWOP tab, and enter your
callsign, latitude and longitude (see the mouse-over help for format
details),
the CWOP servers (three should be entered) and port numbers.
Go ahead and enable &ldquo;Log CWOP Packet?&rdquo;; you can disable it after
submission is confirmed. Click Save Changes.
</p><p>
Now, restart wview:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo /etc/init.d/wview restart
</pre>
</p><p>
You can monitor CWOP packet submission in the system log (and on the
CWOP status pages).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2973580.0x2a6cab8"></a>
Weather Underground</h2></div></div><p>
The Weather Underground (Wunderground) is a
privately held organization that provides many weather services&mdash;some
free and some not. Among the free services is the ability to register
your weather station and submit your data to them, so you can access
your data and some nice graphs from the Wunderground site. Weatherforyou.com 
also is a privately held outfit with similar capabilities to Wunderground.
</p><p>
Register for a Weather Underground Station ID (unless you already have
one) at <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/weatherstation/usersignup.asp" target="_self">www.wunderground.com/weatherstation/usersignup.asp</a>.
Determine your accurate latitude and longitude:
<a href="http://www.topozone.com/viewmaps.asp" target="_self">www.topozone.com/viewmaps.asp</a>.
</p><p>
Click the Services tab and enable the HTTP service. Click HTTP
Services and configure the Weather Underground settings. Click Save
Changes.
</p><p>
Look in the system log for something similar to:


<pre     class="programlisting">
"WUNDERGROUND: configured to submit \
               station KTXCOLLI1 data to wunderground.com"
</pre>
</p><p>
Confirm your data at the Wunderground server:
http://www.wunderground.com/weatherstation/WXDailyHistory.asp?ID=XXXXXXX,
where XXXXXXX is your Wunderground Station ID. This should start
displaying your weather data graphically and as a packet list.

Data Archive and External Applications</h2></div></div><p>
A number of simple open-source weather station applications
are available that do little more than extract the data from the weather
station and archive it for later post-processing or retrieval by another
server for multisite analysis. Researchers wanting to gather weather
data for their own purposes is one example of such an implementation.
</p><p>
It is often (incorrectly) asserted that wview is &ldquo;more
application&rdquo;
than is needed for simple archival purposes. In fact, wview allows
for much configuration as to &ldquo;how much&rdquo; it does for you. Designed as
a series of loosely coupled UNIX processes, wview easily can be
configured as an archive-only server. It also is easy to add CWOP and/or
Wunderground/Weatherforyou to the archive server&mdash;all without any
&ldquo;fancy&rdquo;
HTML or other file generation. If you don't want to generate a Web site,
you don't have to have one!
</p><p>
After installation and typical configuration, disable all wview Processes
(under the Services tab in wviewmgmt). The station interface process
always is enabled and, thus, is not configurable. Start wview as normal.
Only the wviewd_&lt;station&gt; d&aelig;mon will be running, collecting data from the
station and archiving records and HILOW values in the archive databases.
</p><p>
Because wview stores archive data in SQLite3 databases, it is a simple
matter to implement scripts or applications that access the data via
SQL. Many wview users create their own custom Perl/PHP/Java/WordPress
applications for their weather data.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2973580.0x2e65440"></a>
Weather Site Customization</h2></div></div><p>
The default generation model for wview is to generate a weather Web site
based on a series of HTML file templates and images. For any template
file named example.[ext]x and listed in html-templates.conf, wview
will generate a file named example.[ext]. Thus, myscript.phpx
listed in html-templates.conf and found in $prefix/var/wview/html
will have all wview tags replaced, and the resulting file will be named
myscript.php. For any template file named example.htmx and listed
in html-templates.conf, wview will generate a file named example.htm.
The resulting files are stored at the location specified on the wviewmgmt
File Generation page: &ldquo;Generation Target Path&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Changing HTML templates in $prefix/etc/wview/html does not require you to
restart 
wview. The changes you make will take effect at the next
htmlgend (HTML generation d&aelig;mon) generation cycle. Changing the config files images.conf,
html-templates.conf and (if supported) forecast.conf does not require
restarting wview, but it does require an HUP signal to be sent to htmlgend
to cause these files to be reread. Do this as follows (this also
will toggle log verbosity):


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo kill -s HUP `cat $prefix/var/wview/htmlgend.pid`
</pre>
</p><p>
wview supports template macro file inclusion in template files. The
meta-tag is &lt;!--include filename.xxx--&gt;. Any template macro file that
is to be included in one or more template files should be listed
<span   class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span>
any templates including it in the $prefix/etc/wview/html-templates.conf
configuration file. There is no restriction on the levels of inclusion,
just be sure you specify macro templates early in the html-templates.conf
file. The wview default Web site templates utilize several header
macro files.
</p><p>
HTML template files (in $prefix/etc/wview/html) can be customized
to your language and design preferences. The configuration
file html-templates.conf specifies the template files to be used for
generation. You may add or remove from this list as needed. Weather
image captions can be edited in the $prefix/etc/wview/images.conf
file for your language preferences. The configuration parameter on
the File Generation Page &ldquo;Enable Metric Units For Generation?&rdquo; allows
for configuration of metric units. If set to &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, it causes wview to
output all images (buckets and charts) as well as all values for HTML
tags in metric units. The file images.conf can be edited to translate
the English labels, titles and units to any language. By editing this
file and the HTML template files, any language can be supported by wview.
In fact, you easily can switch back and forth between US and metric units
by toggling this configuration parameter and restarting wview.

Advanced Features</h2></div></div><p>
wview provides a number of features that allow advanced
use of the weather data collected from your station. Alarms may be
defined such that if an upper or lower bound is exceeded, a user-defined
script will be executed. These scripts may send a notification e-mail
or trigger an external application. It's also possible to connect to
the wview server via TCP/IP socket and receive an unsolicited, periodic
data feed of weather data. By using the &ldquo;Virtual&rdquo; station
type, you can
connect to another wview server remotely and receive the station data
as if it were connected directly to the station hardware.
