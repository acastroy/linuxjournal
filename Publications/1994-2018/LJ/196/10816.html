Yes, you still need a firewall. How about a transparent one?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a47580.0x1b3f460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
When I started writing this column in autumn of 2000, I had the
day job of firewall engineer. I enjoyed that type of work, but I was enough
of a big-picture kind of guy to be aware that every year, firewalls
were becoming less important in the overall scheme of things. In fact,
I was convinced that within a decade or so, firewalls would be nearly
if not completely obsolete.
</p><p>
But, I was wrong! Firewalls aren't dying. They're
<span   class="emphasis"><em>evolving</em></span>, and
even though traditional firewall technologies probably achieve less
than they did ten years ago, the threats we'd face if we did without
them still justify the effort and expense of keeping them around.
</p><p>
So, I think the time is ripe for me to return to my roots, so to speak.
This month, I kick off a series of articles I've been meaning to tackle for some
time: how to build a transparent firewall using Linux. To begin, I set
the stage by explaining why firewalls are still relevant in the first
place and the difference between &ldquo;routing&rdquo; and
&ldquo;bridging&rdquo;
(transparent) firewalls.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a47580.0x1b3f7d0"></a>
What Firewalls Do and Don't Do</h2></div></div><p>
I was tempted to begin with a primer on firewall architecture and
design, discussing the difference between the multihomed and
&ldquo;sandwich&rdquo;
topologies, rule design methodology and so forth. But my April 2007 article
&ldquo;Linux Firewalls for Everyone&rdquo; does that just fine, and you
still can read it on-line (see Resources). Instead, I'm 
going to talk about why firewalls are still useful.
</p><p>
An IP firewall, as opposed to an application firewall or XML gateway,
inspects network traffic at the IP and TCP/UDP layers, possibly with
some very limited amount of application intelligence (for example, being
able to distinguish between FTP &ldquo;get&rdquo; and &ldquo;put&rdquo;
commands, HTTP &ldquo;post&rdquo;
vs. &ldquo;get&rdquo; and so forth). In actual practice, most packet-filtering
and &ldquo;stateful&rdquo; IP-filtering firewalls evaluate traffic primarily based
on source and destination IP addresses, and source and destination UDP
or TCP ports.
</p><p>
When I started out in network engineering, just filtering traffic based
on these few criteria seemed plenty powerful enough for most practical
firewall applications, especially if the firewall was smart enough to
track network traffic by session rather than by individual packet. (In
olden times, it wasn't enough to program your IP-filtering firewall to
allow outbound DNS queries on UDP port 53; you also had to put in a
corresponding rule to allow DNS replies <span   class="emphasis"><em>originating</em></span> from UDP port
53. State-tracking, or &ldquo;stateful&rdquo;, firewalls automatically correlate
packets to already-allowed sessions.)
</p><p>
Because in those days of yore different network applications all used
different TCP and UDP ports&mdash;TCP port 23 for telnet, TCP and UDP ports
53 for DNS, TCP ports 20 and 21 for FTP and so forth&mdash;filtering by
port number equated to filtering by application type.
</p><p>
This didn't mean firewalls could detect or prevent evil that
might occur over an <span   class="emphasis"><em>allowed</em></span> source/destination/address/port
combination. We had no illusions that the firewall could stop, for
example, Apache buffer overflow attacks against a public Web server
reachable from the entire world on TCP port 80. The firewall
<span   class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span>
(and can), however, prevent attempts to connect to that Web server via
Secure Shell on TCP port 22, except perhaps from some internal, authorized
access point.
</p><p>
The problem is that every year, we're less able to rely on the assumption
that the things we should be worried most about will happen on ports
that the firewall can block altogether. This is because so much of what
people use networks for happens on only two TCP ports: TCP 80 (HTTP)
and TCP 443 (HTTPS).
</p><p>
Even ten years ago, developers were racing to migrate from client-server
application architectures, in which every network application used its
own communication protocol, to the Web services model, in which there
are really only two types of network transactions, Web sessions and
database transactions. Well before then, people started figuring out
ways to do practically everything that can be done over networks&mdash;from
browsing a filesystem to running a remote desktop session&mdash;over HTTP using a Web browser.
</p><p>
But does this really mean that firewalls are obsolete? Definitely not,
not even in contexts where Web servers are involved. Let's suppose
it were true that <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> network traffic between two security zones
happened over TCP port 443. By restricting traffic by source IP address
and destination IP address, you still could make decisions about which
hosts could initiate <span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> transactions to any other given host.
</p><p>
If one filters traffic strictly based on source and destination IP
addresses and, in practical terms, not by TCP/UDP port (service type),
you may think that you haven't achieved much. All an attacker has to do
in order to attack a protected system is gain access to some other
system that the firewall allows to initiate transactions with your
actual target. But, what if none of those &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; systems that the
firewall considers trusted is externally reachable? If that's the case,
your &ldquo;crude&rdquo; firewall rules may, in fact, have effectively mitigated
the risk of remote compromise for that system.
</p><p>
This scenario is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows a firewall that
sits in between two different networks, Zone A and Zone B, and the
Internet. The firewall blocks all inbound traffic from the Internet
to either zone, but allows hosts in Zone B to initiate transactions
with hosts in Zone A. In this case, the firewall is highly effective in
making it unfeasible for Internet-based attackers to exploit the trust
relationship between Zones A and B, even if the firewall filters only
on source IP address.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10816f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Filtering Only by Source IP Address
</p></div></div><p>
But, I'm not really advocating address-only
filtering. The fact is there
<span   class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> still plenty of important network services that use ports
and protocols besides TCP 80/443 and HTTP/HTTPS. Domain Name Services
still use TCP and UDP 53; Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (Terminal
Services) still uses TCP port 3389; Oracle still uses TCP port 1521;
and so on. Modern firewalls still make plenty of meaningful decisions
about what traffic to allow, based on service type.
</p><p>
Another argument against the usefulness of firewalls is the fact
that malware (viruses, trojans, worms) has evolved from being mainly
a nuisance to becoming a sophisticated means of infiltrating even
well-secured networks. Ten years ago, the most likely impact of a virus or
worm outbreak in one's organization was a disruption of service. Malware
tended to strain system and network resources, but by its indiscriminate
nature, it wasn't very useful for stealing data or breaching sensitive
systems.
</p><p>
Nowadays, however, malware often is targeted at specific organizations
by attackers who first go to great lengths to learn what data and
systems to have their malware seek out, based on known (or highly
probable) vulnerabilities on those systems. In other words, nowadays
malicious hackers often deploy worms as &ldquo;avatars&rdquo; of themselves!
</p><p>
Such targeted malware is extremely difficult to detect, remediate against
or trace back. Often, it's placed directly on target networks or systems
by co-opted insiders. Therefore, firewalls frequently have little useful
role in blocking the activity of targeted malware. It doesn't matter how
thick your fortress walls are if your mailroom guys have been bribed to
ignore the fact that the large package addressed to your king is
ticking.
</p><p>
But I ask you, does the fact that bad guys may simply
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mail</em></span> your
king a bomb, mean that you can safely replace those expensive castle
walls&mdash;the tuckpointing-bill for which in any given year is probably
astronomical&mdash;with cardboard? I, for one, don't think you can.
</p><p>
Just because attackers are developing ever-more sophisticated tools
doesn't mean they'll forget how to use the old ones. Remember the
LAND attack from the late 1990s? It involved sending spoofed TCP packets
bearing the same source IP address as the target to which you're sending
them, causing a massive &ldquo;reply to myself&rdquo; sort of loop, which impairs
system performance (potentially cripplingly). LAND was made obsolete by
system patches and firewall protections&mdash;or so we thought. But in
2005,
a security researcher named Dejan Levaja discovered that Windows Server
2003 and Windows XP SP2 were vulnerable to the LAND attack.
</p><p>
The fact that LAND attacks are (still) trivially blockable by firewalls is
actually beside the point. What I'm really trying to illustrate is that
no attack is truly obsolete for as long as it's still feasible and as
long as systems are vulnerable to it. In theory, if your organization
rigorously hardened every single computer connected to the network,
if you took down your firewalls you might not get infected or attacked
right away. But I guarantee you would, sooner rather than later, and
not strictly by completely cutting-edge attack techniques.
</p><p>
So, to summarize,
even if you think all your firewall does is block traffic from
unexpected sources, it still provides meaningful protection.
Modern network traffic does not, in fact, consist solely of HTTP and
HTTPS; it still plays out over a surprisingly wide range of different
ports and protocols.
And, the rise in use of targeted malware and attacks against Web applications
aren't arguments against firewalls; they're simply reasons that firewalls
<span   class="emphasis"><em>alone</em></span> aren't sufficient to protect critical systems.
</p><p>
Can we agree, then, that firewalls are still an important tool in the
network security toolkit? I hope so, because I'm about to spend several
months showing you how to build a particularly clever type of Linux
firewall: a transparent firewall.

Routing vs. Bridging Firewalls</h2></div></div><p>
Normally, a firewall acts like a router. It receives traffic from two
or more network interfaces and makes decisions about whether and how
to route that traffic. Any host that needs to send traffic through the
firewall must either use the IP address of the firewall interface that
faces it as its default gateway, or a router between that host and the
firewall must be configured to use the firewall as a route to whatever
networks are on the other side of the firewall.
</p><p>
Figure 2 shows a routing firewall. As you can see, each firewall
interface has its own IP address that is valid on the network to which
that interface connects, and that IP address serves as the route to the
other side of the firewall. In this example, hosts in Network A have to
know (or send packets to some router that knows) that 10.20.30.254 is the
gateway to reach Network B. Hosts in Network B have to know (or speak to
a router that knows) that 44.55.66.254 is the gateway to reach Network A.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10816f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. A Standard (Routing) Firewall
</p></div></div><p>
One ramification of the &ldquo;firewall as router&rdquo; approach is that
normally, if you have a big bunch of existing systems you want to
divide into two security zones, one &ldquo;trusted&rdquo; and the other
&ldquo;non-trusted&rdquo;,
you'll probably need to re-IP-address the hosts in one or both zones
(or re-mask the subnet they're on, which may not be possible) and insert
a firewall configured as a gateway between those zones. In other words,
inserting a routing firewall into an existing network usually means
reconfiguring both the network and the systems connected to it.
</p><p>
But, what if you wanted to insert a firewall between two parts of the
same network, without re-addressing <span   class="emphasis"><em>anything</em></span>? Is it possible to
configure a firewall to act more like a bridge than a router?
</p><p>
Indeed, it is. And best of all, the firewall's rules will look and behave
in much the same way as if it were a standard routing firewall! All the
trickery is in the firewall's network configuration.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a47580.0x1b376b8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
What Is Bridging, Exactly?</b></p><p>
This month's column assumes you know something about networking. IP
firewalls, whether standard/routing or transparent/bridging, are at
least an intermediate-level topic, and you really can't expect to
configure either kind unless you have a working understanding of how
TCP/IP protocols work.
But even if you do, you might be a bit rusty on the difference between
bridging and routing. Here's a quick, simplified primer.
</p><p>
Routers operate at Layer 3, the IP layer. They evaluate network packets
based on their IP headers. In contrast, bridges operate at Layer 2,
the Data Link (most commonly Ethernet nowadays) layer. Bridges evaluate
Ethernet headers. A &ldquo;switch&rdquo; is simply a bridge with lots of ports.
</p><p>
To &ldquo;route&rdquo; is to make decisions on what to do with a packet based on its
destination IP address&mdash;specifically, to determine the most efficient
&ldquo;route&rdquo; (series of forwarding routers) by which to deliver the packet
to its destination. These decisions can be complicated. There may be
many possible routes, and because individual &ldquo;hops&rdquo; between gateways in
a given route may become congested or otherwise slow down, the
&ldquo;best&rdquo;
route for a stream of packets may change during the course of a single
network transaction.
</p><p>
For this reason, routers use a combination of routing algorithms, routing
tables and forwarding tables to compute routes &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo;. Note,
however, that although firewalls act <span   class="emphasis"><em>like</em></span> routers, they seldom
have to make nearly so complicated routing decisions as true routers
typically do. Typically, a firewall uses a single gateway for all routes
to &ldquo;internal&rdquo; networks and another for all other
(&ldquo;outside&rdquo;) networks,
where both gateways are actual routers.
</p><p>
Bridging, in contrast, is much simpler. A bridge, or switch, looks at each
incoming Ethernet frame entering each bridge/switch port and determines
its destination Ethernet address (also known as a MAC address). It then
matches this against the entries in its local MAC table (which is simply a
list of the MAC addresses of all devices currently attached to active
ports) and delivers the frame to the corresponding local port.
</p><p>
For more complete discussions of how routers and bridges/switches work,
Wikipedia is a good place to start.
</p></div><p>
Figure 3 shows a transparent (bridging) firewall. In this example, the
firewall has been configured to treat both of its network interfaces as
switch ports. Neither interface has an IP address bound to it! Instead,
the virtual switch that they comprise has a <span   class="emphasis"><em>shared</em></span> IP address of
44.55.66.254. Although the firewall might be reachable by this IP address
(actually there are good reasons for it <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to be), none of the
hosts in Zone A need to use that IP as a gateway in order to reach
the hosts in Zone B, or vice versa. Just as with any other switch,
the firewall will propagate packets automatically without needing to be
explicitly routed through.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10816f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. A Transparent (Bridging) Firewall
</p></div></div><p>
However, the firewall will propagate packets only after first matching
them against its firewall rule set and determining whether it even
<span   class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> propagate them. If you want to evaluate packets based on
Ethernet header attributes, you can do so using ebtables. However,
in this series of articles on building your very own transparent Linux
firewall, we'll use plain-old iptables to evaluate packets in the same
way that routing firewalls do, using IP/TCP/UDP header information.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
But, that will have to wait until next time. Hopefully, you now understand
the difference between a standard, routing firewall and a transparent,
bridging firewall. In my next column, I'll sketch out an example usage
scenario (conceptually very similar to the network in Figure 3), describe
a couple different approaches to selecting Linux firewall hardware
and begin showing how to configure a transparent firewall, starting with
bridge/switch setup. Until then, be safe!
