Retrieve your CouchDB data using views and map-reduce functions.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcab580.0xda3358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month's column was an initial look at CouchDB, a non-relational,
open-source database server, now sponsored by the Apache Software
Foundation. CouchDB uses many Web-related standards: data is stored
in JSON format, communication takes place using JSON and RESTful
resources, and functions are written in JavaScript. CouchDB is not as
speedy as some of the other non-relational (NoSQL) databases, such as MongoDB and Cassandra. However, CouchDB is designed to
be dependable and easily replicated across multiple servers&mdash;a far cry
from relational databases, for which replication remains slightly
annoying at best.
</p><p>
Last month, I explained how once you have created a CouchDB database, you can
use the curl utility to insert, update and remove documents. Each
&ldquo;document&rdquo; is nothing more than a JSON object, which means it's
basically a hash (a Python dictionary), which then may contain
arbitrarily nested levels of arrays, hashes and scalar values (that is,
strings and numbers). So, I can create a database with an HTTP
<tt  >PUT</tt>
request:

<pre     class="programlisting">
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5984/atf
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, I can add some documents to that database with HTTP
<tt  >POST</tt>
requests:


<pre     class="programlisting">
curl -X POST http://localhost:5984/atf
     -d '{"first_name" : "Atara", "middle_name": "Margalit", 
          "sex":"f", "last_name" : "Lerner-Friedman", 
          "birthday" : "2000-dec-16"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:5984/atf
     -d '{"first_name" : "Shikma", "middle_name": "Bruria", 
          "sex":"f", "last_name" : "Lerner-Friedman", 
          "birthday" : "2002-dec-17"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:5984/atf
     -d '{"first_name" : "Amotz", "middle_name": "David", 
          "sex":"m", "last_name" : "Lerner-Friedman", 
          "birthday" : "2005-oct-31"}'
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, I can check to see that there are three documents, by using an
HTTP <tt  >GET</tt> request on the database:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-3.2# curl -X GET http://localhost:5984/atf

   {"db_name":"rmltest","doc_count":3,
    "doc_del_count":0,"update_seq":3,"purge_seq":0,
    "compact_running":false,"disk_size":12377,
    "instance_start_time":"1273430793169153","disk_format_version":4}
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, the <tt  >"doc_count"</tt> attribute shows that
there are, indeed, three documents in this database.
</p><p>
Now, if you have only three documents, querying them doesn't make
much sense. But, if you have 300, or even 300,000 documents, 
you certainly are not going to want to iterate over them just to
determine which is the best match and/or most appropriate.
</p><p>
If you were using a relational database server, you would use SQL
to retrieve the rows that match a particular set of criteria. Even
MongoDB, which I covered earlier this year, offers a query language
that is vaguely SQL-like. CouchDB, however, offers a completely
different query system, based on JavaScript functions and the
map-reduce paradigm. CouchDB's syntax takes some getting used to,
especially if you are relatively new at writing JavaScript functions.
However, a few small functions can give you a great deal of
power, which is (perhaps) the secret behind CouchDB's success.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcab580.0xda3ae8"></a>
CouchDB Views</h2></div></div><p>
I've already explained that CouchDB refers to each stored data item as a
&ldquo;document&rdquo;. CouchDB defined a special kind of document, known as a
&ldquo;design document&rdquo;, which contains a &ldquo;view&rdquo;&mdash;JavaScript code that is
executed when you want to perform the query. (Design documents also may
contain &ldquo;show&rdquo; functions, which can sort or otherwise modify the
way in which data is displayed, but I won't discuss &ldquo;show&rdquo; functions in
this column.) If you are developing only a database or applications,
you might want to avoid the overhead of a permanent view by
creating a temporary view instead. Temporary views take less time to
set up and are a bit more flexible, but they execute much more
slowly.
</p><p>
So, let's begin by creating a temporary view and some basic JavaScript
views. For the data, I'm using the information I entered
above, about my three children. (Feel free to substitute information
about your own children, if you prefer.) I find it easiest to create
temporary views using Futon, the Web-based administrative and
maintenance tool that comes with CouchDB. Simply point your Web browser
at the server on which CouchDB is running, on port 5984, and go to your
database of choice. Then, select temporary view from the
pull-down menu in the top right-hand corner.
</p><p>
Your screen now should consist of two parts: on the left side, you
have a simple JavaScript function, under the header &ldquo;map&rdquo;:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function(doc) {
  emit(null, doc);
}
</pre>
</p><p>
If you ever have used &ldquo;map&rdquo; in a language such as Ruby, Python,
JavaScript or Lisp, this function already might make sense to
you: your function is invoked repeatedly for a list of documents. If
it produces a key-value pair, that pair is added to the output
from the function running across all documents.
</p><p>
For instance, the example function (which is anonymous) takes a
document as an argument, and returns a null key and the document
itself as the value. If you click &ldquo;Run&rdquo; under the code, you get a
set of results: three &ldquo;null&rdquo; keys on the left side and the original
documents (with their mandatory _id field) on the right.
</p><p>
You can, of course, modify the function such that it outputs
only information about girls. To do that, write:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function(doc)
{
    if (doc['sex'] == 'f')
    {
        emit(null, doc);
    }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice how by using a simple if statement, you can eliminate
unwanted rows. Now, what if you're interested in getting all the
documents, but sorted. CouchDB orders the results by their keys,
which means the key you use is useful not only for
identifying the resulting documents, but also for ordering them. You
could, for example, sort the results by first name:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function(doc) {
        emit(doc.first_name, doc);
}
</pre>
</p><p>
In my case, this means I first get the record for my son
(Amotz), followed by Atara, followed by Shikma. Sorting by last
name in this particular case doesn't help very much, because they all
have identical last names. But, keys can be any data type, which means
you even can use an array to arrange items, by last and then first
name:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function(doc) {
        emit([doc.last_name, doc.first_name], doc);
}
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can sort them by birthday:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function(doc) {
    emit(doc.birthday, doc)
}
</pre>
</p><p>
However, this will not necessarily have the effect you want. The
&ldquo;birthday&rdquo; field is a text string, which means the sorting will
be done as a string, rather than as a date. (In the case of my
children's birthdays, the sorting happens to work out fine, but this
is a happy accident, not inherent to CouchDB.)
</p><p>
If you want to create a permanent view, there are a few ways to
do so. You can use the Futon (Web-based) interface, and any
temporary view can be turned into a permanent one by clicking on save
as from the temporary view's screen. But another way, and one that's
a bit more flexible if you're writing complex code, is to use curl
to <tt  >PUT</tt> a new design document on the server. This document contains
JSON, like all other documents in CouchDB, but it has a number of
fields that are treated specially by CouchDB. Here is my file, which
I called simpleview.json:


<pre     class="programlisting">
{
    "_id" : "_design/example",
    "views": {
        "show_by_birthday": {
            "map" : "function(doc){ emit(doc.birthday, doc) }"
        }
    }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, I uploaded the contents of this file using curl, as follows:


<pre     class="programlisting">
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5984/atf/_design/simpleview 
 &#8618;-d @simpleview.json
</pre>
</p><p>
By using the -d flag and the @ sign, I was able to tell curl to upload
the JSON from a file, rather than the command line. I uploaded it to
a design document (as you can see from the
<tt  >"_design/"</tt> at the beginning
of its name), with the view called simpleview. Once uploaded, I
then could run it from Futon (by going to the menu item
<tt  >"show_by_birthday"</tt>), or by again using curl:


<pre     class="programlisting">
curl -X GET http://localhost:5984/atf/_design/simpleview/
&#8618;_view/show_by_id
</pre>
</p><p>
The results of the query are the same no matter what. Futon displays
them in a nicer format, but it obviously would be easier for a program
to work with the JSON output via HTTP. If you want to
edit the view, you can either re-upload it via curl or use Futon
to go to the view and edit the JavaScript function.

Reduce</h2></div></div><p>
So far, the examples here have focused on writing &ldquo;map&rdquo; functions, which take the list of
documents and outputs a series of key-value pairs. But, as you might
imagine, the map-reduce paradigm has two parts, the second of which is
called reduce. The idea is that you use map to filter and transform
the data into a list, and then use reduce to turn that list into
something even more useful, typically a single value. For example, you
can define the reduce function as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function(keys, values, rereduce) {
    return 1;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
From within Futon, this returns a list of three documents, the
keys of which are the birthdays, and the values of which is the
number 1. This isn't very interesting, to be honest, because you could
have accomplished the same thing from within the &ldquo;map&rdquo;
request. But, if you invoke the same query from curl, you get something else entirely:

<pre     class="programlisting">
{"rows":[
    {"key":null,"value":1}
]}
</pre>
</p><p>
Why the difference? And, why is there only a single row now?
</p><p>
The answer is that reduce is designed to, well, reduce things.
That means instead of returning a result for each row, it
returns a single result from all rows. The reduce function actually can
be invoked in two ways:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The usual way, in which the &ldquo;keys&rdquo; and &ldquo;values&rdquo; represent
document keys and values. In such cases, the &ldquo;rereduce&rdquo;
parameter is set to false.
</p></li><li><p>
For rereducing, the &ldquo;rereduce&rdquo; parameter is set to true, the
keys are null, and the values represent values from a previous,
partial run of the &ldquo;reduce&rdquo; function.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
As the CouchDB Wiki states, this means the reduce function must
be both commutative (that is, the order in which arguments are processed
doesn't matter) and associative (that is, the order in which operations
are executed doesn't matter). This often (but not always) means
the reduce function ends up performing addition or multiplication,
returning the result of executing the function on all documents. One
example of a reduce function that I found calculates the standard
deviation from mapped results, so you can find out how similar the
documents are along at least one dimension.
</p><p>
Learning to use map-reduce in CouchDB can take some time. However,
this paradigm has proven itself for a decade or so. For example, as
the backbone for Google's search system, map-reduce has demonstrated
excellent performance and flexibility. Granted, Google is using
something (or some things) that are not CouchDB, but with a similar
interface and paradigm.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
If you like the idea of using JavaScript, MVCC, easy replication and
JSON documents, CouchDB might be a good choice. It 
apparently is not as fast as some of its non-SQL competition, such as
MongoDB and Cassandra. However, CouchDB's built-in (and
sophisticated) Web interface, RESTful communication and the
flexibility of map-reduce are all good reasons to use it. CouchDB is
so easy to set up and use, why not try it out? Even if you end
up not using it, CouchDB is a great way to learn about map-reduce and
to try to create some small functions using it.

Resources</b></p><p>
The home page for CouchDB is at the Apache Project
(<a href="http://couchdb.apache.org" target="_self">couchdb.apache.org</a>). There, you not only can download the
software, but also read documentation, from tutorials to an active wiki.
The CouchDB Web site also has links to drivers for the various
languages you're likely to use when working with CouchDB.
</p><p>
If you're interested in the JSON format used by CouchDB, you can learn
more about it at the main Web site: <a href="http://json.org" target="_self">json.org</a>.
</p><p>
Finally, two good books on CouchDB were released in the past few
months. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Beginning CouchDB</em></span> by Joe Lennon, published by Apress, is
aimed more at beginners, but it has a solid introduction to CouchDB,
Futon and how you might use the system. <span   class="emphasis"><em>CouchDB: The Definitive
Guide</em></span> by J. Chris Anderson, Jan Lehnardt and Noah Slater, published
by O'Reilly, is a bit more advanced and meaty, but it might not be
appropriate for beginning users of non-relational databases.
