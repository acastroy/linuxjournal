With an inexpensive camera and a Linux system, you can be producer,
director, editor and even the grip of your next blockbuster.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d3580.0x1acb300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
By profession, I'm a music teacher. Four times a year, my students perform
a show at a local coffeehouse called Coffee Amici. The room hosts
regularly scheduled performers, open-mic nights and various community
events. My students love to play there. It's a great opportunity for them
to show their stuff for an attentive crowd, and eventually, they asked
about the possibility of doing video recordings of the shows. I looked into
the affordability of the requisite gear, the extent of Linux support for
recommended hardware, and the availability of software that would help
me produce a simple DVD from my recordings. I was happy to discover that
the project was well within my price range and that my software choices
included more than one adequate solution.
</p><p>
This article describes how I recorded a student show with an inexpensive
camcorder and how I produced a movie from that footage with Kdenlive,
a non-linear editor (NLE) for Linux. Kdenlive is a powerful program,
but my project was simple, and the methods I describe here should be
usable in other Linux NLEs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d3580.0x1acb510"></a>
Learning about the Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
First, I needed a video camera. My research and my budget led me to
the Samsung SC-D382 miniDV camcorder (Figure 1). For about $100,
I got a camera with a remote control, a DV interface (IEEE 1394,
aka FireWire) and advanced settings that can be configured for
a relatively good-quality recording. It's lightweight, and I found it
easy to operate and control. Obviously, more money gets more camera,
but I intended to keep expenses as low as possible without compromising
the quality of the basic material.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10746f1.large.jpg"><img src="10746f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Samsung SC-D382 miniDV Camcorder
</p></div></div><p>
By default, the camcorder produces video in an NTSC 4:3 display format,
commonly associated with the square screen of a television in North
America. The default audio setting appears to be with a sample rate
of 32kHz with a resolution of 12 bits. The camera's advanced settings
allow me to set the preferred display format to NTSC 16:9, also known as
widescreen, and to increase the audio bit resolution to 16 bits. Alas,
the audio sample rate is fixed, so CD-quality sound is not possible with
the Samsung, a limitation I overlooked when purchasing the unit.
</p><p>
Of my two studio machines, only one has an integrated IEEE 1394
connection. I planned to use both boxes for video work, so I bought and
installed an inexpensive PCI board that added three IEEE 1394 ports to my
main machine. If you plan to make a connection with a FireWire-enabled
camera, check for a port on your motherboard and make sure you have an
available slot for an extension board if you need one. And by the way,
even the cables need attention. FireWire cables have a variety of pin
configurations, so be sure you have the right connectors on both ends
of the cable. For example, my camcorder wants a 4-pin connector, and the
ports on my machines require a 6-pin adapter.
</p><p>
I also bought a carrying case for the cameras and a good tripod with
bubble levels and a variety of gizmos to position the camera in just about
any direction. I've been especially happy with the tripod, and I
advise anyone interested in amateur video recording to invest in a
decent stand for your camera. Yes, you can solve a lot of problems in
your edit stage, but you'll save time and energy if your basic material
is centered correctly from a stable position.
</p><p>
I drew the line for my expense account at lighting. The camera provides
autocorrection for lighting and focus, and my project didn't need a
dedicated light system. I was ready to consider my software requirements.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d3580.0x1acb930"></a>
The Software Side</h2></div></div><p>
I had two primary concerns on the software side. I needed to ensure that
the kernel versions included the IEEE 1394 modules and that I would find
a video editor user-friendly enough for a total newbie. The modules
issue was non-problematic. My main box runs 64 Studio 2.1, a by-now
old Debian-based system running on a 2.6.21 kernel compiled for 64-bit
hardware and real-time operation, while my secondary 32-bit machine
runs a more-modern Ubuntu Jaunty system with a 2.6.29 kernel optimized
for real-time performance. Both systems provide the required
modules&mdash;raw1394, ohci1394, ieee1394&mdash;all of which are autoloaded when the
machines go through their hardware discovery during the boot process.
</p><p>
The process of finding the right video editor consisted of trying out the
available NLEs for Linux to determine which one offered the most amenable
work flow. During the process, I wrote a series of profiles on Linux NLEs
that you can read at LinuxJournal.com. I worked on a simple project
in each editor, and I found that more than one program could serve my
purpose. I finally decided that Kdenlive (Figure 2) provided the tools I
needed in a layout that was easy for me to understand and operate. For
the project described in this article, I used Kdenlive 0.7.6, but since
then, I've been building the program from the latest SVN codebase. By
the time you read article, this minitutorial Kdenlive should be available in a
shiny new version 0.7.7.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10746f2.large.jpg"><img src="10746f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

The Shoot</h2></div></div><p>
The coffeehouse is a single room with good acoustics and lighting that
poses no special problems for a video recording. Coffee Amici also has
an excellent in-house sound system manned by co-owner Craig Allen,
so I knew the original sound source would be well balanced. I
planned to perform with most of the students, so I needed to position
the camcorder where I could operate it remotely. I also needed to get
a good shot of the performance area and a good audio level. Fortunately,
I had no problems with my setup, and the shoot was trouble-free.
</p><p>
Incidentally, I learned that the camera's battery will last just long
enough to record a complete 60-minute miniDV tape. The student shows
routinely last at least that long and often longer. Wherever possible,
I plan to use the camcorder's power supply, but now I know how long I
can expect the battery to perform before I need to switch it out for
a recharge.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d3580.0x1acbe00"></a>
The Transfer</h2></div></div><p>
Kdenlive records real-time video over a FireWire connection or from
a Video4Linux (V4L)-compliant Webcam. The program also utilizes the
RecordMyDesktop software for capturing on-screen actions, such as mouse
movements, window placement, program controls and so forth. I used
Kdenlive's Record Monitor panel (Figure 3) to transfer the videotape
recording to my computer. The panel provides full transport control of
my camcorder, and I quickly searched for and found the sections I wanted
to transfer to disc. I clicked on the Record control when I wanted to
transfer the video, and I clicked it off until the video reached the next
interesting point.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10746f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Kdenlive's Record Monitor Panel
</p></div></div><p>
When I was finished with each transfer, Kdenlive asked if I wanted
to import the resulting DV file. I said yes, and my transferred video
appeared in the Kdenlive Clip list. When my clip collection was complete,
my project was ready for the editing stage.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d3580.0x1acc118"></a>
Into the Editing Room</h2></div></div><p>
I dragged and dropped my clips along the timeline in the multitrack
display. I wasn't concerned with their accurate placement yet, because
I had three main jobs to do first as an editor:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Trim excess footage.
</p></li><li><p>
Add audio and video fades to the start and end of each clip.
</p></li><li><p>
Create title clips to introduce each performance clip.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Kdenlive's Scissor tool made quick work of the excess footage. The
fade-ins and fade-outs are drag-and-drop effects with user-definable
lengths and auto-sync between the audio and video fades, a handy default
action. The material had no need for color correction or other repair,
so I proceeded to create my title clips.
</p><p>
The name and length of the title clip can be redefined at will, and a
titling editor is provided for adding text, images and background colors
to the clip. The editor has a number of amenities, including some handy
positioning tools and animation effects. However, I intended to use the
title clips only for introducing each performer's footage, so I kept
things simple again with a yellow text against a basic black background.
</p><p>
After editing my title clips, I could then drag and drop them as
needed. Thanks to Kdenlive's Snap function, they aligned themselves
instantly when I placed them near their respective footage, yet another
friendly default action. I added fades to those clips too, and I was
effectively done in the edit room.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d3580.0x1acc5e8"></a>
Configuring the Output</h2></div></div><p>
Kdenlive's Render button opens a dialog for preparing your movie for its
eventual output format (Figure 4). I selected the DVD option from the
Destination list, named the output VOB file, and defined the format as
NTSC. I set the encoder for a 2-pass rendering to a widescreen display,
ticked the option to open the DVD Wizard after rendering, and clicked
the Render To File command. Next I made some coffee (it seemed the
appropriate thing to do) while Kdenlive did the rest.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10746f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d3580.0x1acc8a8"></a>
Making the Disc</h2></div></div><p>
The DVD Wizard (Figure 5) stepped me through the process of preparing an
ISO image to burn to disc. I selected my files, defined the disc chapters
and made a basic menu. The menu builder can set the background to a color,
an image or a video file. I selected an image of the coffeeshop at
night and added a text overlay of menu items. Each item is linked to a
particular target&mdash;that is, one of the chapters defined during the Wizard's
configuration. The whole process was uncomplicated enough to bring me
quickly to the final stage of creating the DVD image. I clicked on the
Create ISO Image and again let Kdenlive do the rest while I finished
that coffee I brewed earlier.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10746f5.large.jpg"><img src="10746f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
The ISO image creation dialog includes an option to start a disc-burning
program when the image is ready. I selected the K3B option and followed
that program's instructions until I had successfully burned the number of
discs I needed. Some discs were specially prepared media for use in my
laptop's Lightscribe drive. Templates for making detailed CD/DVD labels
are available for various Linux graphics programs, and the Lightscribe
technology will burn the label graphics directly to the surface of the
special discs, giving them a professional appearance.
</p><p>
Simplicity and ease were my prime directives throughout this project, so
when I wanted to make inserts for the disc jewel cases, I availed myself of
the services of Avinash Chopde's cdlabelgen, an on-line insert creation
utility. I selected a background, added titles, songlists and credits,
and saved the output as a PDF file to be printed as needed (Figure 6).

Notes for Fellow Novices</h2></div></div><p>
I'm definitely an amateur in the video domain, but I'm having a lot of
fun learning about it. I've benefited from the advice and suggestions
from many people far more knowledgeable, so in keeping with the spirit
of sharing helpful information, I've assembled the following notes in
the hope that they might benefit other newcomers.
</p><p>
First, take the time to learn about your hardware. You need to
know exactly what to expect from it during and after the shoot. Buy an
extra battery and keep it charged. Buy a good stand and extra tapes.
</p><p>
On the set, set up your shoot carefully and take extra care for camera
position and lighting. Record your audio and video at the highest
quality your camera allows. Record your audio at a strong level, but
avoid clipping. Normalize audio only as a last resort. Bear in mind that
normalization raises the level of the noise floor along with all other
sound in the normalized track.
</p><p>
Be generous when transferring your video from camera to
computer. Approximately 13GB of storage space is required for 60 minutes
of DV-formatted video, but massive storage is cheap these days. Restrict
your edits to simple functions. Avoid fancy transitions and don't get
distracted by effects. Yes, effects are great fun, but unless they truly
add something to the final product they are best left for another project.
</p><p>
Know your target destination (disc, stream, file), and format your
rendering options accordingly. Two passes are better than one, but life
is short. Do what you can with the time you have, then move on.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d3580.0x1ac38c8"></a>
The Wrap</h2></div></div><p>
I felt that I had done my homework, that I had made my choices as wisely
as possible. Nevertheless, I was a newbie at video production, and I
expected surprises. As my work progressed, I was surprised indeed, but
only at how easily the entire process flowed along. My hardware behaved
as expected, Linux provided the necessary low-level support, and the
applications software worked without troubles throughout the process.
</p><p>
Kdenlive was a special pleasure. I had no problems with its interface,
and its tools and utilities were easy to learn and apply. Since my first
project, I've learned more about Kdenlive, and I continue to work with it
as my primary video production software. There's far more to the program
than the few features presented in this article, so if you're interested
in affordable video production with Linux, be sure to check out Kdenlive.
</p><p>
I hope you've enjoyed this little introduction to amateur video production
with Linux. I've had a lot of fun making my own movies with my little
setup, and I hope to improve its capabilities in the future. It may be
some time before I can afford a better camcorder, but in the meanwhile,
I can look forward to new releases of Kdenlive to keep me busy.
