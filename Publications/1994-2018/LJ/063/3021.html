    The PVM system helps us in designing parallel processing
    programs for multi-computer systems. The implementation of
    the parallel algorithm enables the solving of large mechanic
    problems requiring large amounts of computer time and
    memory.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ab580.0x1aa3500"></a></h2></div></div><p>In scientific calculations, we often
process a large amount of data, requiring much computer time. Thus,
the studying of parallel and distributed algorithms is a serious
requirement in the developmental computer age. In this paper, I
discuss the implementation of algorithms solving engineering
mechanics problems in the form of parabolic differential equations,
in particular the problem for transfer and diffusion of pollution
in underground water. The problem's algorithms are implemented in a
heterogeneous network of computers running Linux. Thus, we will
obtain a distributed network including many processors in the form
of a multi-computer. This multi-computer has formed a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Parallel Virtual Machine</em></span> (PVM). Developing
applications for the PVM system follows the traditional paradigm
for programming distributed-memory multiprocessors such as the
nCUBE or the Intel family of multiprocessors. This paradigm can be
subdivided into two categories:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The master-slave (host-node) model in which a
separate <span   class="emphasis"><em>control</em></span> program termed the master is
responsible for process spawning, initialization, collection and
display of results, and timing of functions. The slave programs
perform the actual computations; they are either allocated their
workloads by the master (statically or dynamically) or they perform
the allocations themselves.</p></li><li><p>The node-only model where multiple instances of a
single program execute, with one process (typically the one
initiated manually) taking over the non-computational
responsibilities in addition to contributing to the
computation.</p></li></ul></div>

We used the master-slave model to implement the parallel algorithms
for our water pollution problem. We also proposed and proved some
mathematical questions; for example, the establishment of an
approximated solution and an estimation of the error contained in
the approximated solution.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ab580.0x1aa3870"></a>Parallel Algorithms</h2></div></div><p>In this paper, we apply the parallel algorithm to calculate
the diffusion S(t,x,y) of polluted matter resource of underground
water by using the following equation. This is the evolution
problem in the form of a quasilinear equation:</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3021f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1
</p></div></div><p>where the variables are defined as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >- s</b>: spongy coefficient of
environment</p></li><li><p><b  >- K</b> : coefficient of
penetration</p></li><li><p><b  >- L</b>: dispersion</p></li><li><p><b  >- z = z(t,x,y)</b>: free surface of
underground water</p></li><li><p><b  >- zd = zd(x,y)</b>: director
surface</p></li><li><p><b  >- Q = Q(t,x,y)</b>: resource of
polluted matter</p></li></ul></div><p>We discrete the problem by using the difference method.
Therefore, we will obtain two tridiagonal systems of linear
equations. Using these equations, we can calculate to find the
concertrantion of pollution Sn+0.25, Sn+0.50 at the point in time
equal to (n+0.25)Dt and (n+0.50)Dt. The flow-chart of the parallel
algorithm is shown in Figure 1.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3021f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Flow-chart
</p></div></div><p>The values Sn+0.25 and Sn+0.50 are calculated concurrently on
two processors of our virtual machine that form a shared or
local-memory multiprocessor.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ab580.0x1aa4478"></a>Parallel Virtual Machine</h2></div></div><p>PVM is a portable message-passing programming system designed
to link separate host machines to form a &ldquo;virtual machine&rdquo; that
is a single, manageable computing resource. The virtual machine can
be composed of hosts of varying type in physically remote
locations. PVM applications can be composed of any number of
separate processes, or components, written in a mixture of C/C++
and FORTRAN. The system is portable to a wide variety of
architectures, including workstations, multiprocessors,
supercomputers and PCs. The most common PVM platform is UNIX, and
it currently runs on more than 30 different platforms.</p><p>In the master-slave model, the master program spawns and
directs a number of slave programs which perform computations. PVM
is not restricted to this model. For example, any PVM task can
initiate processes on the machines; however, a master-slave model
is a useful programming paradigm and simple to illustrate. The
master calls <span   class="bold"><b>pvm_mytid</b></span>, which, as
the first PVM call, enrolls this task in the PVM system. It then
calls <span   class="bold"><b>pvm_spawn</b></span> to execute a given
number of slave programs on other machines in PVM. The master
program contains an example of broadcasting messages in PVM. The
master broadcasts to the slave the number of slaves started and a
list of all the slave tids (task IDs). Each slave program calls
<span   class="bold"><b>pvm-tid</b></span> to determine its task ID
in the virtual machine, then uses the data broadcast from the
master to create a unique ordering from 0 to nproc minus 1
(nproc-1), where nproc is the number of slave processes.
Subsequently, <span   class="bold"><b>pvm_send</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>pvm_recv</b></span> are used to pass messages
between processes. When finished, all PVM programs call
<span   class="bold"><b>pvm_exit</b></span> to allow PVM to
disconnect any sockets to the process, flush I/O buffers and keep
track of which processes are currently running.</p><p>The SPMD (single-program, multiple-data) model contains only
a single program, and no master program directs the computation.
Such programs are sometimes called hostless programs. However, all
processes still need to get started initially. The user starts the
first copy of the program; by checking
<span   class="bold"><b>pvm_parent</b></span>, this first copy can
determine it was not spawned by PVM and can thereby know itself to
be the first copy. It then spawns multiple copies of itself and
passes them the array of tids. At this point, each copy is equal
and can work on its partition of the data in collaboration with the
other processes. Using pvm_parent precludes starting the SPMD
program from the PVM console because pvm_parent will return the tid
of the console. This type of SPMD program must be started from a
UNIX prompt.</p><p>For our program, we used a master-slave programming model.
The master program spawns a copy of the slave program to the other
processor to calculate Sn+0.25, and calculates Sn+0.50 itself. When
both processors have completed the calculation, the master program
will calculate the sum Sn+1 = 0.5(Sn+0.25 + Sn+0.50). The program
will finish when the final step time is completed. The progress of
parallel computing in calculating Sn+0.25 and Sn+0.25 is shown in
Figure 2.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3021f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Progress of Parallel Computing
</p></div></div><p>Linear system equations are also in the master and slave
programs, so we also use the master-slave programming model to
solve the tridiagonal systems by Linear Recurrence of order two.
Horner's algorithm can be implemented to evaluate a polynomial of
degree <b  >n</b> at a single point to run in O(log2n).
If we use sequential algorithms of the LDU factorization of a
tridiagonal matrix, we will run it in O(n).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ab580.0x1aa4b58"></a>Results</h2></div></div><p><a href="3021f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3. Xndd
