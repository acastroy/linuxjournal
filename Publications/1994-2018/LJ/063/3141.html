    The experience of one company selling Windows software using
    Linux to build a reliable e-commerce solution.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d15580.0x1e0d3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Through the use of Linux, open tools, and
a few commercial components, my company built a reliable e-commerce
solution that through its flexibility has enabled us to make our
business more effective and explore opportunities that would
otherwise have been unreachable.
</p><p>The capabilities required to implement such a system used to
be solely in the domain of larger organizations that could afford
large cash outlays and dedicated personnel. Linux has changed this
by making a top-quality, open platform available at virtually no
cost.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d15580.0x1e0d500"></a>Background</h2></div></div><p>In the beginning, we were selling our Windows shareware
stock-tracking software, Personal Stock Monitor, through a third
party. It soon became clear this service didn't offer the
flexibility we needed. When looking at other options, we realized
no third party would be able to do what we wanted. For starters, we
wanted to be able to do the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Make the purchase process as easy and quick as
possible.</p></li><li><p>Get to know our customers better and take the
opportunity to get more feedback from them.</p></li><li><p>Experiment with various business ideas, change our
pricing, provide upgrade incentives, provide discounts, etc.</p></li><li><p>Track sales through multiple distribution channels
and get a much better understanding of how and why people were
buying our software and, more importantly, why people
weren't.</p></li></ul></div><p>Clearly, we needed a better solution that could be changed
quickly as the need arose without a great deal of effort or
expense. Being a small company, we were constrained by limited
resources. However, we were convinced that doing e-commerce
ourselves was a business necessity.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d15580.0x1e0d978"></a>The Business Case for Linux</h2></div></div><p>After looking at a number of options, we chose to build our
own solution and base it on Linux for reasons both technical and
business-related, including:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>We could use inexpensive hardware and share it
between a number of tasks. This meant we didn't need to buy an
extra box and didn't need to upgrade the one we had.</p></li><li><p>We could administer the server remotely as easily
as from the local keyboard. For a small company like ours, this was
one of the many reasons we didn't even entertain using Windows
NT.</p></li><li><p>Linux is rock-solid reliable. As eight months of
operational experience would show, Linux never seems to crash. It
just runs, and as a result, we have more time to focus on
business.</p></li><li><p>All development tools and applications we needed
are available for Linux and most of them are either Open Source or
carry the GPL. All are of high quality.</p></li><li><p>The &ldquo;openness&rdquo; of Linux provides a significant
business benefit. We can always get the answers we need when we
need them at no cost. We've never been slowed down due to lack of
information when using Linux.</p></li><li><p>All critical applications we needed were available
for Linux.</p></li></ul></div><p>We could have chosen other options that would have worked
equally well, but they would have cost significantly more money and
required much more expensive hardware. For our particular needs, we
couldn't find anything we believed could do the job better at any
price.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d15580.0x1e0df50"></a>The Pieces and Parts of an E-Commerce
Solution</h2></div></div><p>Once we decided on Linux, the rest of the system fell into
place.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Transaction Service</b></span></p><p>The first thing we needed was a way to authorize
transactions. We looked at a number of e-commerce tool providers
with varying levels of sophistication. It turns out these
e-commerce companies provide the equivalent of the credit card
machine you see at convenience stores. This means all order
tracking, accounting features, reconciling, demographic reporting,
feedback gathering and interactions with the customer along with
most of the administrative features you need are left for you to
provide.</p><p>For technical reasons, we ended up choosing the Cybercash
service. This provides a library of C routines and Perl modules
supported under Linux. Cybercash calls this software development
kit (SDK) their Merchant Connection Kit. It's essentially a credit
card transaction SDK and makes no assumptions about the rest of
your business. It provides the kind of flexibility we need.</p><p>The Cybercash account didn't cost any money upfront, but it
did have a transaction fee. More information is available on their
web site at
<a href="http://www.cybercash.com" target="_self">http://www.cybercash.com/</a>.</p><p>We especially liked the fact that it wasn't tied to a web
interface. It's just an SDK with which you can build your own
e-commerce desktop applications, CGI scripts or server modules.
It's a very flexible toolkit and was exactly what we were looking
for.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Merchant Account</b></span></p><p>The second component we needed was a Merchant Account that
supported the transaction service we chose. In order to process
credit card transactions, you need to have a merchant account that
acts as an intermediary between your bank account and your
customer's credit card company. Getting a merchant account involves
a large amount of paperwork, a credit check and a setup fee.</p><p>Other than finding a merchant account that supported
Cybercash, we didn't see much difference in the offerings aside
from cost. There's typically a setup fee and fixed transaction
fees. Then the credit card companies take their cut. However, when
all transaction fees are totaled, you're still usually under 4%.
Compared to the fees typically charged by third-party e-commerce
companies, the difference can add up to non-trivial sums. In our
case, we earned back the money we spent setting up our Linux based
e-commerce solution in a couple of months based on this percentage
difference. Typically, on-line software stores for shareware will
charge between 15% and 40%.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>SSL Server</b></span></p><p>The next component we needed was an SSL (secure sockets
layer) server that encrypts traffic to and from the web server. It
increases your customer's confidence and improves the security of
on-line transactions. We were comfortable with the Apache web
server, so we wanted to find an SSL server based on Apache. We
looked at a couple of vendors and ended up making our decision
based on price. We chose the Raven SSL web server, and it has
worked well for us. Their tech support has been very helpful.
Today, a number of other options are available.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Certificate Authority</b></span></p><p>In order to set up an SSL server, you need a &ldquo;certificate&rdquo;
from a third party known as a Certificate Authority. The SSL vendor
will give you a temporary invalid key to use for testing
purposes.</p><p>The certificate is designed to verify the identity of you and
your company. It provides assurance to the customer that they are
actually dealing with your company. Unfortunately, getting a
certificate can be paperwork-intensive, as you must verify your
identity to the Certificate Authority. This usually means giving
them your incorporation paperwork. In our case, it took slightly
over two weeks to go through the certificate process. The
Certificate Authority then issues you a certificate key via mail.
It's just an encrypted block of text that you cut and paste into
your SSL server setup.</p><p>We ended up choosing Thawte for our certificates because they
were less expensive. The only problem we've had has been with older
browsers that no longer recognize the certificate authority. This
generates some spurious errors. However, since fewer people are
using the 3.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> versions of Netscape and MS
Internet Explorer each day, we don't see this as a major
problem.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Database</b></span></p><p>We wanted to be able to do more with our e-commerce solution
than just process fixed transactions. We wanted to have a system
that could easily be extended as the need arose. Additionally, we
wanted to keep track of all kinds of variables so we could answer a
number of questions, such as:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Is the purchase process easy enough?</p></li><li><p>Where do customers hear about us?</p></li><li><p>What versions sell better?</p></li><li><p>Is our pricing effective?</p></li><li><p>Are there any trends in our sales that might shed
some light on our customers?</p></li></ul></div><p>As a result, we needed a robust and flexible database back
end to store and organize all of this data. We needed to balance
the speed and scalability of the database back end with reliability
and ease of programming. Additionally, we needed easy access to the
data and the ability to alter the structure on the fly. Beyond
that, we didn't want to spend much money.</p><p>We decided on MySQL
(<a href="http://www.mysql.com" target="_self">http://www.mysql.com/</a>).
It's extremely fast, multi-threaded, flexible and supports a large
subset of the SQL standard. It's a very popular database for web
applications, and a good Perl interface is available for it. In
addition, the licensing is flexible, and in many cases you are
allowed to use it at no cost. An active mailing list and a
tremendous amount of information is available on their web
site.</p><p>Unlike the SSL server or the merchant account, our choice of
database ended up being a critical one, as it was one of the
components that made a difference when it came time to go after new
business ideas.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Perl</b></span></p><p>We talked about implementing a &ldquo;commercial grade&rdquo;
e-commerce solution in C or C++. This implied a major development
effort and a lot of work if we decided to modify it later.</p><p>Being afraid to lock ourselves into a solution we couldn't
change easily, we opted to develop in Perl, which saved us a great
deal of time at the expense of some runtime speed. We figured since
we were running under Linux that the overhead added by using Perl
would be negligible, and by the time it became an issue we would be
making so much money we could buy a faster machine.</p><p>Another key advantage of developing in Perl is that the code
is quickly and easily changed. On-line business changes so fast
it's hard to keep up. Anything we could do to make it easier on
ourselves was in our business interest.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d15580.0x2207170"></a>Putting It All Together</h2></div></div><p>Once we had all the pieces identified, it was fairly easy to
put it all together. Just two pieces of code were left to write.
The first managed the experience customers have when they come to
our web site to place an order. The second was an administration
interface that enabled us to do some maintenance tasks. The first
version of our solution worked as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Display a form on the secure server that allows the
user to enter their credit card information. It's linked to a CGI
script that does the bulk of the work.</p></li><li><p>In the Perl CGI script, verify the FORM fields and
make sure all required fields are filled with values that make
sense. If there is an error, let the user know, log the error in
the database and send an e-mail notice to the administrator. We
wanted to know how well users were doing with our order form. As a
result of this tracking, we ended up improving the order process
significantly.</p></li><li><p>If no errors are found in the form, format a
Cybercash transaction package with all the relevant fields and pass
it to the Cybercash Perl module for submission to the Cybercash
servers.</p></li><li><p>Take a look at the response codes from Cybercash.
Quite a few fields are returned, but the key ones are the
transaction status and the AVS (address verification service)
code.</p></li><li><p>If the transaction was not authorized, log an error
in the database, let the customer know and fire off an e-mail
message to the administrator.</p></li><li><p>If the transaction was authorized, check the code,
which is a simple test designed to reduce fraudulent transactions.
It compares the numerals in the address and zip code provided by
the customer to the address and zip code present in the records at
the credit card company. The reasoning is that if someone steals
your credit card, it is unlikely they have your address as well.
AVS codes include &ldquo;Y&rdquo; for everything matched correctly, &ldquo;A&rdquo; for
only the address matched, &ldquo;Z&rdquo; for only the zip matched and &ldquo;N&rdquo;
for nothing matched. Unfortunately, the AVS system is available for
US addresses only.</p></li><li><p>Send the customer a thank-you message by e-mail,
log the transaction in the database for later perusal and send the
administrator e-mail indicating that a transaction was
authorized.</p></li></ul></div><p>The administration interface allows us to enter orders by
hand for phone orders, mail-in orders and fax-in orders. It also
allows us to edit individual records and review all transactions
and errors. We use this interface on a daily basis to manually
examine each transaction for signs of fraud. (A complete discussion
of fraud detection is outside the scope of this article.) We've
been seeing a fraud rate of around 1-2%, which we are told is about
industry average.
</p><p>The way our system is set up, transactions get &ldquo;authorized&rdquo;
but do not automatically get &ldquo;settled&rdquo; until we've had a chance
to review them. It is possible to automate the entire process so
that no human is involved, but we prefer to look over all
transactions prior to letting them go through.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d15580.0x2207850"></a>Operational Experience/Lessons Learned</h2></div></div><p>Having our own e-commerce solution built on a reliable
platform with flexible tools has meant we can change our system to
experiment with various methods for improving our business.</p><p>First, we noticed through all of the error tracking we built
into the system that quite a few customers would come to the order
form, try to enter their information once, make some simple error
such as not filling in a zip code and not return. We made some
changes to our data entry form and reduced the number of fields
down to the bare minimum. This seems to have improved things
dramatically&mdash;there was a noticeable increase in sales.</p><p>One afternoon, we decided to add a &ldquo;comments&rdquo; box to the
order form to obtain more feedback from our customers. Strangely
enough, we've found that customers are much more likely to provide
us with detailed feedback while they're ordering our product than
they are at any other time. Because we chose MySQL and Perl to
build the system, adding this option was literally 30 minutes of
work and gave us a whole new opportunity to know our customers. It
has proved surprisingly valuable.</p><p>Another lesson we've learned through experimentation is that
making our product easy to buy makes an incredible difference in
the quantity we sell. You can have a great product, but if it's not
easy to license, few will buy it. Again, the flexibility of the
tools we chose allowed us to try a number of different approaches
until we found one that worked for us.</p><p>On October 20, 1998, we came out with the 3.0 version of our
stock-tracking application. Based on quite a few different
parameters, not the least of which were comments from customers, we
decided to change our pricing and bring out two editions of the
product: a standard and a gold. We also realized we could offer
&ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; incentives on-line. We ended up taking our single
product e-commerce solution and modifying it quickly to sell
essentially four products: two editions and two upgrades, each at a
different price point.</p><p>Another interesting side effect of running our own e-commerce
solution and being able to modify it quickly for new situations was
&ldquo;affiliate transactions&rdquo;. We were presented with a few
opportunities to have other companies promote our software from
their web sites and on their CDs. Obviously, the question arose of
how to account for the sales. Again, the flexibility of the tools
we had chosen allowed to us to respond to these new opportunities.
Had we not chosen Linux and this set of tools, we would not have
been in a position to go after this new business.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d15580.0x2207b10"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Choosing to build a Linux-based e-commerce solution has
provided a critical benefit for our business and allowed us to
effectively respond to constant change.</p></div></div>
