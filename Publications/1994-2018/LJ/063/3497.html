simple question. I would like to know how to get information from a
CD using the X Window System. Can you help me with this? &mdash;Anthony,
DrexelDG@aol.com</p><p>First, mount your CD-ROM using the command
<b  >mount&nbsp;/cdrom</b> if /etc/fstab is properly
configured. Otherwise, as root use
<b  >mount&nbsp;/dev/hdb&nbsp;/cdrom.</b> Your
distribution probably offers some graphic tools to help with the
task; remember <b  >man mount</b> is your
friend.  &mdash;Alessandro Rubini, rubini@prosa.it</p><p>First, in an xterm, log in as root
(<b  >su&nbsp;-root</b> and type in the root password
when prompted). Then, create a directory where the CD will appear
to be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir /mnt/cdrom
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Next, insert the CD and mount it on the directory
you created:</em></span>
<pre     class="programlisting">
mount -t iso9660 -o ro /dev/hdd /mnt/cdrom
</pre>


<span   class="emphasis"><em>Then, you should be able to cd to /mnt/cdrom and use the
files on the CD. When you're done, the command</em></span>
<pre     class="programlisting">
umount /mnt/cdrom
</pre>


<span   class="emphasis"><em>will tell Linux to &ldquo;let go&rdquo; of the CD so you can eject
it and work on another.  &mdash;Scott Maxwell,

saying, &ldquo;BIOS32 extension does not exist. Sorry, this release
still depends on it!&rdquo; I am unable to boot Linux because of this.
What should I do? &mdash;Mark, msudnick@ionsys.com</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>LILO must be installed on your MBR (Master Boot
Record), on a floppy disk</em></span> or the first sector of your
Linux partition. If you have an IDE drive, it must be located
before the 540MB limit; if you have a SCSI drive, it must be lower
than cylinder 1024. Is your LILO installed in the proper
location? &mdash;Daniel Lafraia, lafraia@iron.com.br</p><p>This message is printed by a SCSI driver which is compiled in
your default kernel and is benign as you don't have that SCSI
controller. Most drivers don't print any message when they fail
detecting the hardware; in my opinion, this is good. It looks as if
your kernel is locking when probing for some other hardware, but I
can't tell which one. You should try to remove any strange ISA
device installed in your system, then compile your own kernel,
leaving out everything of no interest to you.</p><p>Note that most modern distributions use modules for each
device driver in order to avoid probing for uninstalled
peripherals.  &mdash;Alessandro Rubini, rubini@prosa.it</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18a4580.0x199c978"></a>Modem Speed</h2></div></div><p>At what speed is my modem connecting? I have
<b  >REPORT&nbsp;CONNECT</b> in my
<span   class="bold"><b>chat</b></span> script, but it always
indicates I am connected at 57600. How do I query the modem or
<span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> to find out the speed at
which I am actually connected? &mdash;James M. Pothering,
jmpothering@netscape.net</p><p>You need to make a change in your modem settings. Consult
your modem's manual to learn which string to send, then use a
terminal program such as <span   class="bold"><b>minicom</b></span>
to instruct your modem to return the modem-to-remote (DCE) speed,
not the computer-to-modem (DTE) speed. For example, for my modem I
would type <b  >ATW2&amp;W</b>. This turns on &ldquo;Report
connection rate only as CONNECT XXXX&rdquo; (W2) and saves the settings
for the next use (&amp;W).  &mdash;Chad Robinson, chadr@brt.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18a4580.0x199cc90"></a>Applications Stopped Running</h2></div></div><p>I've upgraded to glibc 2.1, but certain older applications
(StarOffice in particular) don't want to run now. How do I either
convince StarOffice to like the new glibc, or else keep the old
2.0.7 installed just for StarOffice's use?  &mdash;Tim Pepper,
tpepper@calpoly.edu</p><p>Here's a shot in the dark... Instead of executing &ldquo;soffice&rdquo;
by itself to start StarOffice, execute the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/<span   class="emphasis"><em>glibc_libraries_path</em></span> soffice
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Be sure to have the 2.0.7 libraries in a directory
separate from all the rest of your system libraries (they typically
reside in /lib). The command above should make StarOffice look for
shared libraries in the <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b> first
before moving on to look elsewhere. Note that you do not want this
particular <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b> variable to be
permanent; you just want to execute it when you start StarOffice.
(Of course, replace <b>/glibc_libraries_path</b> with
the actual path to your glibc 2.0.7 libraries.) &mdash;Erik Ratcliffe,
erik@calderasystems.com</em></span>
</p><p>You can influence how any application searches for shared
libraries by setting the <b  >LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b>
environment variable (don't forget to use <b  >export
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=</b>..., so the environment variable's value
will be visible to applications you run). The value of this
variable should be a colon-separated list of directories to be
searched before the usual locations.</p><p>Writing a simple shell script will make life simpler. Do
something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/<span   class="emphasis"><em>path_old_glibc/</em></span>
exec soffice
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>If necessary, you can also force the issue with
LD_PRELOAD:</em></span>
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
export LD_PRELOAD=/<span   class="emphasis"><em>path_old_libc.so</em></span>
exec soffice

5.1 or 5.2 system from a parallel port Zip drive.  &mdash;Chris Bensch,
chrisbensch@iname.com</p><p>Yes, it should work. The distribution won't autodetect your
Zip drive (I'm fairly certain), but you can tell it you have a SCSI
controller and select the <b  >ppa</b> controller, which
really is SCSI, over your parallel port. You should then be able to
do your install. However, Red Hat will not fit on a Zip drive. You
will have to get rid of many of the packages in the /RPMS
directory, and the installer will complain about not finding those
packages, but should proceed with the install anyway. If you
carefully choose which packages to install on the Zip drive, you
may end up with a working system. In other words, it's much easier
to use a Jaz drive or some other device that can hold at least half
a gigabyte.  &mdash;Marc Merlin, marc@merlins.org</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18a4580.0x199d5d8"></a>Creating Mount Points</h2></div></div><p>I am trying to install the Oracle8 database and don't know
how to create mount points. On the installation guide, it says I
need to make one software mount point /u01 and three DB mount
points /u02, /u03 and /u04. Please tell me how to create them and
what the difference is between these mount points.  &mdash;Tim Wu,
tim@vbisd.org</p><p>A mount point is just a directory. On a UNIX platform, file
systems are not referred to with drive letters. They are mounted,
at which time they become part of the root file system mounted on
/. It is at this location that you create /u01, /u02, /u03 and
/u04. You may need to check the permissions required for those
directories. Also, Oracle may require you to create partitions to
actually mount, but that is another issue.  &mdash;Chad Robinson,
