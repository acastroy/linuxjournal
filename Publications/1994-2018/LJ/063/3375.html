    Mr. Phillips gets the low down on 4Front technologies and
    what's happening in the world of sound.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e40580.0x1f383a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>4Front Technologies is in the business of
supplying UNIX sound card drivers for AIX, BSD, Solaris, SCO,
HP-UX, Linux and other systems. The company has maintained a
particularly amenable relationship with Linux for several years:
4Front's Hannu Savolainen has provided the kernel sound driver and
the system sound applications programming interface. The company
also sells an enhanced supported version of the kernel driver.
</p><p>With warm greetings to Dev Mazumdar and Hannu Savolainen, we
begin:</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>David</b></span>: When, where, why and
how did 4Front go into business?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Hannu</b></span>: Actually, our story
began in August 1992 after I got Linux working for the first time.
I had started writing a Sound Blaster driver for Minix, but dropped
the project for various reasons. I ported it to Linux and released
the first hack after a couple of weeks. What happened after that is
a long story.</p><p>Then in September or October 1994, Dev contacted me. He was
selling an MCA-based sound card and asked if he could port my
driver to AIX. After a few e-mail messages, we decided to join
forces and port the driver to everything that moves.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3375f1.jpg"></div><p>Initially, our idea was to sell commercial Open Sound System
(OSS) only for operating systems other than Linux, since there
didn't seem to be any market for OSS/Linux. However, we decided to
release OSS/Linux because the software was ready. We just had to
check that there were no copyright issues.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Dev</b></span>: I began writing the
sound drivers for the Creative Labs Sound Blaster MCA on IBM's new
RS/6000s that had MCA slots in 1992/3. Back then, the Internet was
small and only about three or four of us were doing sound drivers
for UNIX.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>David</b></span>: Who currently does
what at 4Front?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Hannu</b></span>: By definition, my
responsibility is design and programming while Dev does support,
marketing and also maintenance of our web site. However, these days
Dev does almost as much programming as I do.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Dev</b></span>: I also run the copier
and take out the trash! ;-) In all seriousness, my main functions
are mainly to run the day-to-day business operations of 4Front. I
make customer calls and visit various companies that we partner
with. I always defer to Hannu's technical expertise whenever I'm
bug hunting.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>David</b></span>: How many sound
systems are supported, i.e., sound cards, on-board and
external?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Hannu</b></span>: Actually, we
implement support for sound chipsets rather than sound cards. The
same chips are usually used by many sound card vendors, especially
in the Far East. I haven't the faintest idea how many different
sound cards we support.</p><p>Our configuration program currently knows 250 different
&ldquo;sound card&rdquo; names. I think about 150 of them are unique in one
way or another and have required at least minor modifications to
OSS. The remaining 100 names in the list are some kind of alias
names for some chipsets. We had to add them because so many
customers keep asking why this or that sound card is not in our
supported card list.</p><p>We support or are currently working on about 40 to 50
&ldquo;major&rdquo; sound card architectures or chipsets.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Dev</b></span>: A better picture is to
multiply the number of sound chips by the number of UNIX versions
by the features for each sound device (audio, MIDI, mixing, synth,
etc.) to get the size and complexity of OSS!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>David</b></span>: How do you decide to
support a card or system?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Hannu</b></span>: Mainly, decisions are
based on customer feedback, but sometimes just because some cards
look particularly interesting in some way. It's actually easy to
figure out which chipsets need to be supported by looking at how
many potential customers are asking if they are supported.</p><p>At this time, our focus is on the popular PCI-based chipsets
made by big vendors such as Creative, ESS, Aureal and
Yamaha.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Dev</b></span>: As far as operating
systems are concerned, system vendors are coming to us and
requesting OSS, since they've seen it in action on Linux.
Additionally, with the booming number of applications with OSS,
we're finding many UNIX and real-time vendors are taking notice of
the fact and are approaching us. A recent example is HP
(Hewlett-Packard). We approached HP a while back about porting OSS
to HP-UX and only now have we entered into a development agreement
because of the attention Linux has been receiving.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>David</b></span>: What sort of work
goes into creating, testing and eventually marketing a sound
driver?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Hannu</b></span>: The first thing is to
get the programming specifications for the sound card or chipset.
This usually takes a very long time, since hardware manufacturers
simply don't have suitable documentation available
immediately.</p><p>The programming can start after getting the specs. The tough
part is getting the first sound from the device. With complex 3D
PCI audio accelerators, this takes months, since the complexity of
these chips is at least in the i286 class. Usually everything has
to be done in complete darkness, since there is no way to see what
the chip is doing internally. After the first sound, everything is
much easier since we can at least hear what the chip is
doing.</p><p>After the card seems to work, we test the driver for about a
month in two or three different machines. After that time, it's
released as a beta version so that everyone willing to try it can
do so. Finally, the beta status is removed after several months, if
no significant problems have been reported.</p><p>Actually implementing low-level drivers for different sound
cards is just one part of the picture. Another big task is trying
to figure out why certain applications are constantly causing
problems. If something in OSS should be improved, we do it.
However, we will not try to fix buggy applications by changing our
code.</p><p>Another big task is making the installation easier. After
all, a large number of our customers are those who don't want to
spend their time getting things working. If they don't get sound
working quickly, they just leave it alone. So we have to make it
possible to download and install OSS in two minutes without reading
any manuals. This is actually an endless battle, since Linux and
the PC architecture is a rapidly moving target. All Linux
distributions are slightly different, as are the different kernel
versions. We currently support all 2.0.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and
2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> releases.</p><p>Finally, users have an infinite number of different CPU,
chipset, SMP/UP, sound card and other hardware combinations (I
almost forgot to mention overclocking). In addition, many users
compile the kernel themselves and install all kinds of UFPs
(unidentified flying patches) to their machines. It's a big
challenge to identify the problems caused by these differences and
find a workaround. We generally release a new OSS revision every
two to four weeks (usually after a new kernel version is released)
just to address these kinds of issues.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>David</b></span>: Please describe how
your relationship with Linux has evolved over the years.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Dev</b></span>: I have a UNIX
background and worked on the IBM RT 4.2 BSD-based kernel, as well
as the AIX 3<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> kernel for IBM (in a joint
project with USC). One of my first drivers was the console driver
for the IBM Megapel 5081 graphics card, and following that was the
first color X Window System X11R1 server for the card.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3375f2.jpg"></div><p>I began to run Linux for the first time in 1994 when 1.2.13
came out (until then, I had a monstrous AIX/RS6000 530 at my desk).
From my point of view, Linux has the best device driver programming
environment, and it's developer-friendly compared to other UNIX
environments. Of course, supporting customers on Linux is much more
difficult than on RISC-based UNIX systems, due to the PC
architecture's ISA bus.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Hannu</b></span>: I have a minicomputer
background. I started programming with an HP3000 Series III at
Lappeenranta University of Technology
(<a href="http://www.lut.fi" target="_self">http://www.lut.fi/</a>) in
1981. For this reason, I never liked DOS or anything else that ran
on a PC. I had my first contact with UNIX (HP-UX) in December 1984,
and it was the only OS I was interested in. So it was natural that
I bought Minix in May/June 1991 soon after my first 386/25 PC. I
installed the i386 extensions and GCC and had just finished porting
a myriad of applications to it when I made my first contact with
Linux. I was one of the lucky guys who saw the historic message
posted to comp.os.minix by Linus (August 25, 1991).</p><p>At that time, I was already disappointed with Minix and I had
started to plan my own OS called SKUNKX (for Smells liKe UNiX) but
had not actually started writing it. My immediate first reaction
about that no-name UNIX clone was slightly negative, because it was
a competing project. I forgot the whole thing (both Linus and my
project) for some time until I saw some information about the
release of the first Linux version. I decided to skip the first
ones, mainly because my machine had nonstandard disks (SCSI) not
supported by Linux. After the first AHA1542 driver, it took a few
months before I figured out how to get the card to work with Linux,
which used a different IRQ than was available in my system. I don't
remember what the solution was, but eventually I got Linux
installed in summer 1992. After that, I formatted my disk for Linux
and have used it as my main operating system ever since. It was
amazing how reliably it worked even in those days.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, I soon started working on the Sound
Blaster driver in my spare time. After the first release, it
quickly got the attention of a few users who made suggestions and
sent some fixes. Together with Craig Metz, we expanded the Sound
Blaster driver to support the Pro Audio Spectrum PAS16. A few
months later, I started adding support for the Gravis Ultrasound
and received significant help from Greg Lee. Within a year, support
for some other cards was added and finally the driver was included
in the kernel.</p><p>In addition to developing OSS, I also use Linux for almost
everything I do with computers, mainly all kinds of programming,
e-mail, news, Net surfing, web server, Samba and reading
documentation with Acrobat. All these features have worked very
well since I started using Linux, or actually after I upgraded my
machine to run X. Now, after getting StarOffice, there really
aren't many reasons to use any other OS. I'm sure this will get
even better in the near future.</p><p>As Dev said, Linux is a very good (if not the best)
environment for device driver development work. Hardware
interfacing is very easy, since Linux doesn't try to hide the iron
behind a stack of abstraction layers. Also, Linux doesn't try to
enforce any particular programming model, so you can do what you
want in the way you deem most suitable.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>David</b></span>: How does 4Front
regard the evolution of Linux itself?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Dev</b></span>: As a commercial
company, we would love to see Linux go to the desktop because
that's where sound support makes a great deal of sense compared to
the server arena that Linux has now begun to dominate.</p><p>Make no mistake&mdash;commercial applications will continue, and a
lot of bright minds are tied up writing &ldquo;non-open-source&rdquo;
applications. We expect the Open Source movement maturing and
becoming all-inclusive of proprietary and GPL applications. We also
expect to see a number of companies to use our hybrid
open-source/proprietary model. Many companies will release part of
their application under open source and still sell a proprietary
version that has additional functionality, yet maintains API
compatibility with the free version.</p><p>This allows for clean healthy competition between the
open-source and proprietary development teams. We are in some ways
competing with the OSS/Free kernel drivers that are now maintained
by really talented folk like Alan Cox. Some cards are supported
only in OSS/Free, such as support for the Apple PowerMac audio and
the Sun SPARC SS20 audio.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Hannu</b></span>: I think our first and
biggest mistake with OSS was the stupid idea that we could control
all sound driver development for Linux. Actually, it's best for all
(even for us) that independent groups continue developing the
freeware drivers. This gives us some peace to concentrate on the
features and sound cards most important to our current and future
customers. Of course, this means there will be competing drivers
for many sound cards, but I actually see this competition as a
challenge rather than a problem.</p><p>The fact that we are making commercial, binary-only software
doesn't mean we are against open-source ideology. We are here only
because Linux and the original &ldquo;VoxWare&rdquo; sound driver was Open
Source. Our original idea was to maintain one common source base
for both OSS and OSS/Free. In this way, it would have been possible
to easily incorporate most additions made to OSS to OSS/Free. This
model was brain-dead, because it made it very difficult to adopt
contributions to OSS/Free. The current model for how OSS/Free is
maintained is much better. The internal architecture of OSS/Free is
now significantly different than OSS, so our code is not very
useful for the OSS/Free team. However, I'm sure we can find a way
to make contributions to OSS/Free in the future.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3375f3.jpg"></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Dev</b></span>: You will see our
concept used by many open-source developers&mdash;Sendmail, Ghostscript
and others are examples of how developers have come up with a
&ldquo;proprietary/open-source&rdquo; model to generate revenue. It takes
complete commitment from the authors, and this means giving up day
jobs and concentrating on the software. We have received kudos from
many customers about OSS and this is what keeps us going.</p><p>4Front has been profitable, and we are not funded by venture
capital or by sound-card or OS vendors. We may be in a position to
hire some people next year if the pace of Linux's growth
continues&mdash;it's all about being able to grow from a garage shop
into a professional company by doing what you do best.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>David</b></span>: What can Linux users
expect from future releases of 4Front drivers?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>4Front</b></span>: We are currently
working on support for all those popular PCI sound cards. Support
for some high-end audio cards should be released during the second
half of this year. Features of the base OSS will remain almost
unchanged this year, but we are implementing some features which
will make OSS useful in simulators (3D sound effects) and radio
(on-air) systems. Next year, the focus will most likely be on
adding new features to the API, at least on the MIDI programming
side, like support for DLS samples in the SoftOSS virtual synth and
support for MIDI patchbays.</p><p>Of course, we will continue our work in making OSS even
easier to install and use than it is today.</p><p>We're also looking at more OS support. For example, we'll be
working on BeOS support later this year. We may look into Mac OSX
when it comes out later this year, as it's rumored to have a
UNIX-like core.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>David</b></span>: Is there anything you
would like to add beyond these questions?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>4Front</b></span>: We would like to
thank all the developers who have been writing audio applications
for Linux. OSS couldn't have done it without your support. We hope
your foundation work will bring more talented people from other
operating systems into the Linux and OSS platform.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>David</b></span>: Please tell <i  >LJ</i>
readers something about what you guys do outside of your
involvement with the company.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Hannu</b></span>: My family takes up
most of my time outside work. My hobbies are reading, listening to
music, movies, bicycling, swimming, cooking and digital
photography. I collect all kinds of electronic gadgets. I'm also
trying to get some experience in the electronic engineering side,
but don't seem to have enough time.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Dev</b></span>: My hobbies include
playing volleyball on the beach all year (one of the luxuries of
living in Los Angeles). I also like skiing and golf (I'm a horrible
hack at that!). I used to build electronic gadgets as a kid. I'm
