    How to let the site visitor know which documents he hasn't
    seen.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2143580.0x223b5b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Like many people, I spend a great deal of
time on the Web. Some of that time is spent working&mdash;writing and
debugging programs for various clients. I also spend quite a bit of
time reading on the Web, keeping track of the latest news from the
real world and the computer industry, and even exploring new sites
that friends and colleagues have suggested I visit.
</p><p>A common feature on web sites, one which never fails to annoy
me, is the proliferation of graphics indicating which items are
new. I don't mind the fact that the site's author is letting me
know the most recently changed or added items. Rather, it bothers
me to know that these tags indicate whether the document is new,
rather than whether the document is new for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>me</em></span>.</p><p>When I visit a site for the first time, all of the documents
should have a &ldquo;new&rdquo; indication, since all are new to me. When I
return to the site, only those added since my previous visit should
have the &ldquo;new&rdquo; graphic, perhaps including those modified since my
last visit. In other words, the site should keep track of my usage
patterns, rather than force me to remember whether I have read a
particular file.</p><p>This month, we will take a look at this problem. Not only
will we see how to create a web site that fails to annoy me in this
particular way, but we will also look at some of the trade-offs
that often occur when trying to handle site maintenance, service to
the end user and program maintainability.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2143580.0x223b818"></a>The Simple Way</h2></div></div><p>Now that I have disparaged the practice of putting &ldquo;new&rdquo;
labels on a web site's links, let me demonstrate it, so we can have
a clear starting point. Here is a simple page of HTML with two
links on it, one with a &ldquo;new&rdquo; graphic next to it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;Head&gt;&lt;Title&gt;Welcome to My Site&lt;/Title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt;
&lt;Body&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Welcome to My Site&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Read &lt;a href="resume.html"&gt;my
resume.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Read &lt;a href="deathvalley.html"&gt;&lt;img src="new.gif"&gt;
about my recent trip to Death Valley!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/Body&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p>When the page's author decides enough time has passed, the
&ldquo;new&rdquo; logo will go down. These labels are updated by modifying
the HTML file, inserting or erasing the graphics as necessary.
</p><p>This technique has a number of advantages, the main one being
that the site requires less horsepower to run. Downloading text and
graphics does not require as much of the server's processor as a
CGI program, which requires additional memory as well as processing
time.</p><p>However, this technique also has many disadvantages. First of
all, the labels change only when the webmaster decides to modify
the HTML file, rather than on an automatic basis. Secondly, the
labels fail to take users' individual histories into account,
meaning first-time users will see the same &ldquo;new&rdquo; labels as daily
visitors.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2143580.0x223ba80"></a>Auto-expiring the Labels</h2></div></div><p>How can we approach this problem? Let's begin with a simple
solution that does not use personalization, but does provide more
accurate labels than the above approach. We can auto-expire the
labels, printing &ldquo;new&rdquo; during the first week a file is made
available and &ldquo;modified&rdquo; the second week. Files more than two
weeks old will not have a label.</p><p>The easiest way to do this is via server-side includes. SSIs
execute as if they were CGI programs, but their output is inserted
inside an HTML file. SSIs are useful when you want dynamic or
otherwise programmable text inside an HTML file, but don't have
enough dynamic output to justify burying the HTML inside a CGI
program.</p><p>In this particular case, we can take advantage of Apache's
advanced server-side include functionality, which allows us to
execute a CGI program and insert its output into an HTML file. For
example, we can slightly modify our file like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;Head&gt;&lt;Title&gt;Welcome to My Site&lt;/Title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt;
&lt;Body&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Welcome to My Site&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Read &lt;a href="resume.html"&gt;my resume.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Read &lt;a href="deathvalley.html"&gt;
&lt;!-#include
virtual="/cgi-bin/print-label.pl?deathvalley.html"
-&gt;
about my recent trip to Death Valley!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/Body&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p>As you can see, the second link includes an SSI. One nice
thing about SSIs is they look like HTML comments, so if you
accidentally install an SSI-enabled file on a server that does not
know how to parse them, the entire SSI will be ignored.
</p><p>SSIs work thanks to a bit of magic: before the document is
returned to the user's browser, it is interpreted by the server
(hence the term &ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>server-side</em></span> includes&rdquo;).
Apache replaces all of the SSI commands with the result of their
execution. This could mean printing something as simple as a file's
modification date, but might be as complicated as inserting the
results of a large database-access client invoked via CGI.</p><p><a href="3473l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.
print-label.pl</a></p><p>In the above example, we run the CGI program print-label.pl,
the code for which is in Listing 1. While this program is run via
SSI rather than a pure CGI call, it works just like a CGI program.
We use CGI.pm, the standard Perl module for writing CGI programs,
to retrieve the <span   class="emphasis"><em>keywords</em></span> parameter, which is
another way of describing a parameter passed via the GET method
following the question mark.</p><p>Once we have checked to make sure the file exists, we use the
<b  >-M</b> operator to ask Perl to tell us the number of
days which have passed since the file was last modified . If
<b  >$ctime</b> is equal to less than 7, the file was
modified within the last seven days, meaning the file should be
considered &ldquo;new&rdquo; for our purposes. We use a
<b  >font</b> tag to tell the user that the file is
new.</p><p>If we use SSI with each link on our site, the &ldquo;New!&rdquo;
message will appear for all links less than one week old.</p><p>I considered several ways of handling errors within
print-label.pl, including using Perl's
<span   class="bold"><b>die</b></span> function to exit prematurely
and print an error message on the user's screen. In the end, I
decided the program should exit silently if the file does not
exist, or if no file name is specified at all. You may wish to send
a message to the error log, which can be accomplished from within a
CGI program by printing to STDERR as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
print STDERR "No such file \"$filename\"\n";
</pre><p>A major problem with this arrangement is that CGI programs
are inherently resource hogs. If we have ten links on a page, using
this technique involves running ten CGI programs&mdash;which means
launching ten new Perl processes each time we view this page. For
now, we will ignore the performance implications and focus on how
to get things working. I will discuss performance toward the end of
this article and in greater depth next month.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2143580.0x223c210"></a>Bringing the User Into the Picture</h2></div></div><p>The above technique is a good start, but it still ignores the
user's perspective. That is, the links are expired on an absolute
time scale. But a user who visits the site less than once per week
will see too few &ldquo;new&rdquo; labels, while someone who visits it more
often than once per week will see too many &ldquo;new&rdquo; labels.</p><p>How can we take care of that situation? One way is to keep
track of when the user last visited our site, and make the
comparison to that time stamp rather than to the file's creation or
modification date. How can we know when the user last visited our
site? Since HTTP, the protocol used to transport most Web
documents, is &ldquo;stateless&rdquo;, each transaction takes place in a
vacuum. When a web browser makes a request to a server, the request
is not connected to any previous or following request. No
information about previous requests is passed along, and nothing we
do in our request is saved for later ones.</p><p>The best and easiest way is to use HTTP cookies, which nearly
every browser supports. Cookies are variables set by the server and
stored on the client's computer. Cookies allow us to track state
across transactions by storing information on the user's computer.
When the server next encounters the user, it can compare the time
stamp on the cookie with the time stamp on the file.</p><p>Thus, we can rewrite the above program so that it
auto-expires the labels based on when the user last visited the
site. Each time the user visits our site, we set a cookie. The
cookie's expiration date is set to be one week in the future,
meaning that if the cookie exists, this user visited our site
within the last week. Our labeling program (Listing 2,
print-label.pl) then has a simple way to determine whether it
should print &ldquo;new&rdquo; next to a link&mdash;the label should be printed
only if the cookie does not exist.</p><p><a href="3473l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. print-label.pl with
Cookie Check</a></p><p>Because we are using CGI.pm, which includes all necessary
functionality for writing CGI programs, we can check whether the
cookie exists in this way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $visited_recently = $query-&gt;cookie('RecentVisitor');
</pre><p>We can then print the label with the following code:
<pre     class="programlisting">
if (!$visited_recently)
{
        print "&lt;font color=\"red\"&gt;(New!)&lt;/font&gt;\n";
    }
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2143580.0x223c630"></a>Setting the Cookie</h2></div></div><p>That about does it for reading the cookie. But how do we
write the cookie? This is a stickier problem, one which has a
number of potential solutions. The cookie specification requires
that an expiration date be written with a full UNIX-style time and
date stamp, as in</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Thu Apr  8 02:25:30 IDT 1999
</pre><p>We cannot simply create and send a cookie with an expiration
of &ldquo;one week in the future&rdquo;. We also have to figure out a way to
set the cookie from within our HTML file&mdash;unless we want to use a
CGI program to send the text, which would defeat the purpose of
using SSIs to begin with.
</p><p>One solution, although admittedly not the most elegant or
efficient one, is to take advantage of the <b  >META</b>
tag supported by standard HTML. <b  >META</b> tags have a
number of uses, among them the ability to send data that would
otherwise be sent in an HTTP header.</p><p>Since HTTP cookies are sent as part of the header in the
browser's HTTP request, it's possible to set the &ldquo;RecentVisitor&rdquo;
with the following HTML at the top of our page, within the
<b  >&lt;Head&gt;</b> section:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Set-Cookie"
CONTENT="RecentVisitor=1;expires=Thu Apr
15 02:19:17 1999; path=/"&gt;
</pre><p>This tells the browser it should pretend a
<b  >Set-Cookie</b> HTTP header was sent from the server,
and the <b  >content</b> attribute should be handled as
if it were the header's value. That is, the above
<b  >META</b> tag sets the
<b  >RecentVisitor</b> cookie to <b  >1</b> and
allows the cookie to be anywhere in my domain. The cookie is set to
expire on April 15, 1999.
</p><p>Creating this <b  >META</b> tag is a bit difficult,
since the date depends on when the user loads the page. If the user
loads the page on April 8, the cookie should be set to expire on
April 15. If the user loads the page on April 10, the cookie should
expire on April 17. We need to modify the output according to when
the user visits.</p><p><a href="3473l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3.
send-cookie.pl</a></p><p>The fact that the cookie's expiration date must change with
time means we need to insert a program somewhere. The easiest way
to do this is with another program invoked via SSI, which will
create the <b  >META</b> tag for us. Such a program,
send-cookie.pl, is shown in Listing 3. With that installed and in
place, we can say</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;!-#include virtual="/cgi-bin/send-cookie.pl" -&gt;
</pre><p>Our program, send-cookie.pl, sets the cookie's value by
creating a <b  >META</b> tag based on when the user
accesses it. With this in place, each visit to our site will
produce a cookie that disappears (or &ldquo;crumbles&rdquo;, if you prefer)
within one week. Our SSI checks to see whether that cookie was
sent, and if it was, prints an appropriate &ldquo;new&rdquo; label.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2143580.0x2635170"></a>Problems with this Approach</h2></div></div><p>The above approach has two major problems, one having to do
with the user interface and the second with performance.</p><p>Let's address the user interface issue first. In short, what
happens if the user reloads the page? The first time he viewed the
page, the cookie was set with the <b  >META</b> tag,
regardless of whether the cookie had been set before. The next time
the user loads the page, even if it is just a few seconds later,
the &ldquo;new&rdquo; labels no longer appear, because the cookie has been
set, indicating the user visited the site within the last week. We
need a finer-grained method for keeping track of these
labels.</p><p>The second is a more serious problem&mdash;the performance hit. In
order to implement this solution, we need to invoke at least two
CGI programs for each document on our system. Given how
resource-hungry even the most innocent CGI programs can be,
particularly when written in Perl, this adds a tremendous load to
the web server. Add to this the time it takes to start up a Perl
process and execute such an external program, and our users will
suffer as well, unless we make a significant investment in
hardware.</p><p>We can solve the user interface problem with the
<span   class="bold"><b>Text::Template</b></span> module, written by
Mark-Jason Dominus and recently re-released as version 1.20. This
module, as is the case for most modules, is available from CPAN
(see Resources) or by using the CPAN module that comes with modern
installations of Perl.</p><p>Text::Template allows us to mix Perl and HTML within a file.
Everything within curly braces, {}, is considered to be a Perl
program. The results of the block's evaluation are inserted into
the document in place of its code block. Thus, if we say</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;P&gt;This is a first paragraph.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;{ 2 + 5; }&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is a second paragraph.&lt;/P&gt;
</pre><p>the end user will see
<pre     class="programlisting">
This is a first paragraph.
7
This is a second paragraph.
</pre>


on his or her screen.
</p><p>Remember, the result of evaluating a block is not the output
from that block, but rather the return result from the final line
in the block. So if we say:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;P&gt;This is a first paragraph.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;{ print 2 + 5;}&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is a second paragraph.&lt;/P&gt;
</pre><p>we will see
<pre     class="programlisting">
7 This is a first paragraph.
1
This is a second paragraph.
</pre>


The &ldquo;7&rdquo; comes from evaluating &ldquo;print&rdquo;, while the &ldquo;1&rdquo; is the
returned value from the final line of the embedded Perl block.
</p><p><a href="3473l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4.
template.pl</a></p><p>In order to use Text::Template, we will need to write a small
CGI program that invokes the module and parses the indicated file.
The program template.pl, shown in Listing 4, does the trick simply
and easily. If we install it in our CGI directory, we can then go
to /cgi-bin/template.pl?file.tmpl, and the template file.tmpl will
be interpreted by template.pl, then returned to the user's
browser.</p><p>In order to deal with potential security problems from people
specifying unusual file names, we remove any occurrences of the
string &ldquo;../&rdquo; and ensure all file names start in the directory
/usr/local/apache/share/templates/. You may want to define a
different templates directory on your system.</p><p>Now that we have our templating system in place, we can
rewrite our template cookie, in which contents and &ldquo;new&rdquo; labels
are printed only when necessary. The final result is shown in
Listing 5.</p><p><a href="3473l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5.
travel.html</a></p><p>We create the dynamic <b  >META</b> tag with the
following code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Set-Cookie"
CONTENT="RecentVisitor=1;
expires={scalar localtime(time + 604800}; path=/"&gt;
</pre><p>As you can see, this <b  >META</b> tag contains a
small Perl block that returns an appropriate expiration date. The
date is set to be 604,800 seconds in the future, better known as
&ldquo;one week from today&rdquo;.
</p><p>We retrieve the cookie later in the template, just before
deciding whether to print a &ldquo;new&rdquo; tag:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
use CGI;
my $query = new CGI;
my $visited_recently =
$query-&gt;cookie('RecentVisitor');
$outputstring .= "&lt;font color=\"red\"&gt;(New!)&lt;/font&gt;\n"
unless $visited_recently;
$outputstring;
</pre><p>Notice how we can import the CGI module within a block of the
template. We can then create an instance of CGI and use it to
retrieve one or more cookies. We don't use CGI.pm to print output
to the user's browser, since that will be done by the templating
system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2143580.0x2635c18"></a>Next Month</h2></div></div><p>It would seem that my obsession with &ldquo;new&rdquo; labels has led
us in all sorts of new and interesting directions. This month, we
looked at cookies, server-side includes, CGI programs and HTML/Perl
templates. While templates did reduce the load on the server
somewhat, they still require the invocation of a CGI program, which
is inherently more costly than serving a straight HTML file.</p><p>One solution to this problem is to make the labeling an
inherent part of our web server. If the server could keep track of
the cookies and the labeling, things would work fine. Most people
don't want to mess around with their web server software to that
degree; Apache might be free software that allows you to mess
around with the source, but few of us are that daring.</p><p>However, as we have seen in previous installments of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ATF</em></span>, we can easily modify parts of the server
with Perl, rather than with C, by installing the
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span> module. While such a
system still requires some code for each retrieved document, the
overhead for running a Perl subroutine to Apache via mod_perl is
much lower than that required for an external CGI program.</p><p>Next month, we will examine a mod_perl module that goes
through the links on a page and adds a &ldquo;new&rdquo; label for each item
new to the user accessing the site. When we're done, we will have
made the web a bit better and easier for pedants like me and for
users who should not have to remember when they last visited a
site.</p><p><a href="3473s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p>All listings referred to in this article are available by
