    A report on a community-based initiative to develop a
    professional certification program for Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d6f580.0x1e67348"></a></h2></div></div><p>Some time ago, the idea for a
certification program for Linux existed only in the minds and
discussions of individuals and small groups of people in different
locations and all working separately. Over the past year, many of
these separate people have come together in a community-based
effort to define a Linux certification program. Who is this group?
How did they come together? What have they accomplished to date?
</p><p>We call ourselves the Linux Professional Institute (LPI). As
stated on our web site
(<a href="http://www.lpi.org" target="_self">http://www.lpi.org/</a>), our
mission statement is:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We believe in the need for a standardized,
multi-national and respected program to certify levels of
individual expertise in Linux. This program must be able to satisfy
the requirements of Linux professionals, as well as organizations
which would employ or contract them.
</p><p>Our goal is to design and deliver such a program from within
the Linux community, using both volunteer and hired resources as
necessary. We resolve to undertake a well-considered, open,
disciplined development process, leading directly to the
establishment of a recognized and widely-endorsed Linux
certification body.</p></blockquote></div><p>With these words, we put in writing our overall goal, a
remarkable initiative that emerged from mailing list discussions
over much of the past year. In this article, I will discuss how the
initiative evolved, what our current plans are, and how you can
become involved.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d6f580.0x1e67660"></a>A Brief History</h2></div></div><p>One part of our effort began with an article I wrote for the
October 1998 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span>
(<a href="http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue33/york.html" target="_self">www.linuxgazette.com/issue33/york.html</a>).
In that article, I outlined the reasons I felt a certification
program would help the growth of Linux, and encouraged people to
contact me. The response was tremendous, and we immediately
established a mailing list to help coordinate our discussions.
Along the way, we found other individuals and groups who were also
working on certification and tried to find ways to work together on
this certification effort.</p><p>Meanwhile, a separate effort was underway, coordinated by
Evan Leibovitch of the Canadian Linux User's Exchange (CLUE).
Starting in April 1998, they established a mailing list focusing on
certification and had gone quite far in discussing how a
certification program might be implemented. The list grew rapidly
and came to include people from around the world. At one point,
their list included representatives of three distributions:
Caldera, SuSE and Debian.</p><p>Last November, Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall of Linux International
introduced me to Evan. We immediately saw the similarities between
our two efforts and explored ways of combining the energy of our
two groups After our groups united, we implemented an
organizational structure to help work together and proceed along
multiple paths to develop our program. As we proceeded, the
initiative attracted a highly talented pool of volunteers, many of
whom contributed (and continue to contribute) very long hours
toward bringing our collective program to reality.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d6f580.0x1e678c8"></a>The Need for Certification</h2></div></div><p>Many of us believe a certification program for Linux
<span   class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> occur. The question is whether we want
that certification program to come from a particular vendor or have
it evolve from within the Linux community.</p><p>The people who have come together behind our effort believe
there are a number of reasons why certification is necessary.
Briefly, we feel certification will do the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Accelerate corporate adoption of Linux. As more and
more people learn about Linux and pursue certification, they will
speed up the adoption of Linux within corporate
environments.</p></li><li><p>Create industry recognition. Microsoft, Novell,
Lotus and others have spent millions of dollars convincing the IT
industry of the value of certification. A Linux certification
program will allow those who value certification to see that Linux
&ldquo;has emerged as a viable option&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p>Counter the &ldquo;no-support&rdquo; argument. As more
candidates earn certification, it becomes a statistic that can be
used to indicate how many Linux support professionals are available
in the IT industry.</p></li><li><p>Provide a learning path for new users. Often,
people who want to learn about Linux do not know where to start. A
certification program can provide a path for learning.</p></li><li><p>Provide an organizational mechanism for training
centers and publishers who want a path to help educate their
clients (students or readers).</p></li><li><p>Expand the marketing of Linux. Every training
center and every book that focuses on the path to certification of
a product creates more marketing of that product. Until now,
marketing budgets have been used to promote other operating
systems. We want to see a share of this money promote Linux and
recruit new users.</p></li><li><p>Turn students into advocates. If students learn
about Linux and how to install, configure and use the operating
system, they will become advocates for Linux as they move into the
IT industry. People recommend products they know. We need them to
know Linux.</p></li><li><p>Provide other means of employment for Linux-skilled
individuals. Each person who can be employed writing or teaching
about Linux becomes yet another advocate, potentially full-time,
for Linux.</p></li><li><p>Recognize capabilities of Linux professionals. A
well-done certification program provides a mechanism to recognize
the accomplishments of individuals who use Linux.</p></li><li><p>Assist in the hiring process. Most controversially,
a certification program can assist a hiring manager in
understanding what level of expertise someone has. It cannot be
used as the sole criterion and is not a replacement for years of
experience. However, many IT managers want to start using Linux and
are seeking people knowledgeable in Linux. If the managers don't
know Linux, how can they be certain of the type of background
someone actually has? A certification program helps managers know
that an individual has at least a basic level of Linux
knowledge.</p></li></ul></div><p>A longer description of some of these points can be found in
my October 1998 article in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d6f580.0x1e68268"></a>Developing a Consensus</h2></div></div><p>After recognizing the need, the people who joined our mailing
lists rapidly came to a consensus on a number of issues,
including:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The cost of attaining Linux certification should be
as low as possible. Costs of exams should be targeted to cover
delivery of the exam, with perhaps a slight portion to help offset
development of future exams.</p></li><li><p>The mechanism we develop for delivering Linux
certification must be global in scale. People in any nation must be
able to take exams toward certification.</p></li><li><p>The Linux certification program must be
distribution-neutral and vendor-neutral. It should not be seen as
biased toward any one Linux distribution, nor toward any vendor of
education or other services.</p></li></ul></div><p>Through our program development, we decided we would handle
distribution differences through a distribution-specific exam. We
would create a separate exam for each distribution and cover the
items unique to that distribution, such as installation, graphical
administration tools and file locations.
</p><p><a href="3447s1.html" target="_self">Exam Structure</a></p><p>In order to be global and able to deploy on a massive scale,
we also decided that for at least the first levels, we would need
to use standardized computer-based testing systems such as those
offered by VUE and Sylvan Prometric. We debated at length about
utilizing web-based testing, but could not at this time determine
any mechanism for preventing fraud. As long as someone could have a
friend nearby providing answers (or taking the exam for them), the
potential for abuse is too high. We agreed to continue monitoring
technologies in the hope that someday a solution might be
found.</p><p>In the meantime, we will be working with the computer-based
testing vendors to make our exams available throughout the world.
We are also considering other forms of proctored testing in
locations where testing centers are readily available. For the
highest level of our certification program, we are still debating
whether to have some form of &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; testing. That discussion
and decision is still ongoing.</p><p>Throughout our discussions, we also realized we wanted our
program to focus only on certifying individuals. We want multiple
paths to certification. One person might download our exam
objectives off the Web, work with their system at home, then go and
take the exam, paying only the minimal cost of the exam. On the
other hand, a candidate could also spend a great deal of money on
instructor-led classes to prepare for certification. Someone else
could also go to the bookstore and buy books that would prepare
them for certification. Computer-based classes and web sites will
certainly be options as well. We decided that our effort would be
spent on <span   class="emphasis"><em>certification</em></span>, leaving the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>education</em></span> of candidates to training centers,
publishers and others interested in providing such services.</p><p>Our program is a community effort open to all who want to be
part of the process. For that reason, we continue to use open,
public mailing lists for the majority of our work.</p><p>Finally, a common refrain has been that we do not want our
program to be as weak as many perceive other IT certification
programs to be. We want to be sure this program is done
right.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d6f580.0x1e68948"></a>Our Program</h2></div></div><p>While developing our program, Evan Leibovitch brought in much
of the work developed through the CLUE mailing list. The mailing
lists discussed and debated the program at length. Eventually, a
Program Committee led by Tom Peters took over responsibility and
fleshed out more of the details.</p><p>Through our program, certification will eventually be
available at three levels, though the names of these levels have
not yet been finalized at the time of writing (March 1999). The
exams will be developed gradually, with the required exams for the
first level being created before the second level and so on. In the
short term, this will allow participants to complete lower-level
certification while more-advanced exams are under
development.</p><p>Content for the exams is presently under active development,
although by the time this article is published, much of the first
level of exams should be nearing completion. Although the exact
content and objectives for each exam are still under development,
the exam structure (we chose to label individual tests as &ldquo;T#&rdquo;)
is shown in the sidebar &ldquo;Exam Structure&rdquo;.</p><p>Our intention is to create a separate T2 exam for most major
distributions. The list of T5 exams is merely a set of examples of
the kind of specialized exams which may be produced at this level;
the exact list has not yet been determined.</p><p>As we have currently defined the program, candidates will be
required to pass certain tests to reach the various levels of
certification:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>To achieve Level 1, an applicant must complete T1
and one or more of the T2 exams.</p></li><li><p>To achieve Level 2, an applicant must complete
Level 1, as well as exams T3 and T4.</p></li><li><p>To achieve Level 3, an applicant must complete
Level 2, as well as any two of the T5 exams.</p></li></ul></div><p>The choice of T2 and T5 exams completed will be indicated on
the participant's certificate as endorsements.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d6f580.0x22610c0"></a>Where We Are Today</h2></div></div><p>Throughout early 1999, much of our work occurred in the
individual committees focused on very specific tasks. As outlined
below, we developed a job analysis survey, began our public
relations, built an Advisory Council to provide additional feedback
and formed an independent nonprofit corporation.</p><p>Among our pool of volunteers were several individuals with
degrees in psychometrics, who spent considerable time working on
methods to validate the results of our exams. One of these
individuals, Scott Murray, chairs our Exam Development committee
and has been working hard on ensuring our exams are developed in
the best method possible.</p><p>In March and April 1999, Scott and Tom Peters developed a
web-based system through which we conducted an extensive job
analysis survey. The main purpose of this survey was to aid us in
developing the objectives of our first level of exams. Hundreds of
volunteers took time to complete our surveys and help us
statistically validate the tasks Linux system administrators do on
a daily basis. The results of this survey were used to help us
derive the exam objectives we have posted on our web site.</p><p>During this time, we wanted to ensure our program met both
the needs of the Linux community and the organizations which will
employ the successful candidate; therefore, Evan, Chuck Mead and I
along with other members of our Corporate Relations Committee built
an Advisory Council. This council consists of individuals and
organizations who can provide us with the feedback we require.
Members of our Advisory Council are part of a private mailing list
to which questions are occasionally posted and feedback solicited.
Their assistance is sought to help guide the overall direction of
the LPI program, as well as in helping solve questions that arise
from time to time within the mailing lists where a wider industry
perspective may be useful. As a consultative body, the Advisory
Council provides input to the LPI Board when it makes decisions
related to LPI. In the process of building our Advisory Council, we
had very successful meetings, both at trade shows such as
LinuxWorld and CeBIT, and also separately with individual people
and companies. We announced a large council including
representatives from several distributions, Linux International,
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, UniForum, publishers,
information technology companies and others who believe in the need
for Linux certification. We appreciate their support and assistance
in making our program a reality. Visit our web site (see Resources)
for the full listing of our Advisory Council.</p><p>Meanwhile, Evan and the Public Relations Committee were
collecting names and addresses of reporters and web sites. Evan
coordinated our work to regularly distribute news releases
publicizing our efforts. His work resulted in a great increase in
the number of visits and added participation in our plans.</p><p>We also began to work with the System Administrator's Guild
(SAGE), a special technical group within USENIX, whose members are
working on developing a certification program for UNIX. We shared
information about efforts and designated a few individuals to act
as liaisons between the programs.</p><p>Finally, our Steering Committee began the process of becoming
a formal Board of Directors and incorporating as a nonprofit
corporation. Our board also began the process of submitting funding
proposals to finance the exam development already underway.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d6f580.0x2261430"></a>How You Can Help</h2></div></div><p>By the time you read this, several of our exams should be
nearing completion. Yet even as those exams are nearly done, we
have many more still to develop. Over 200 people are now on our
various mailing lists, and there is no shortage of tasks to
complete. Please visit our web site, read about how you can become
involved, and join in our efforts to make a strong certification
program for Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d6f580.0x2261538"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>It has been a wild ride since we began our discussions last
fall. We have had vigorous debates and put in some very long hours.
Above all, though, our effort has shown the power of many people
working together to accomplish a common goal. We've been able to
take on large tasks and accomplish them primarily because we could
divide the effort between many people. It has truly been a
community project which we believe will result in the finest
certification program in the information technology industry. We
invite you to visit our web site and join with us.</p><p><a href="3447s2.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
