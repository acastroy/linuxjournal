Caldera's OpenLinux Beta 2.2 and was having problems with
<span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span>. Following the suggestions of
Stephan Seyboth (sseyboth@linuxland.de) and Erik Ratcliffe
(erik@caldera.com), I finally got a working ssh. Stephan suggested
I add <b  >-D_GNU_SOURCE</b> to the top-level Makefile,
and Erik suggested I comment out any offending
<b  >HAVE_SYMBOLS</b> in the config.h file. The define
Stephan suggested is not a silver bullet, but it did make a
difference in some cases.
</p><p>I also ended up commenting out <b  >HAVE_UTMPX</b>
in the sshconfig.h, and ssh compiled fine. I am now running
<span   class="bold"><b>egcs</b></span>, which is a bit different
from <span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span>. Apparently, OpenLinux is
much happier being told it is working with GNU source. OpenLinux
uses glibc-2.1, and <span   class="bold"><b>utmpx</b></span> exists
in glibc-2.1. However, somewhere between glibc-2.1, egcs and ssh,
this symbol just isn't recognized (or not handled properly) during
the build.</p><p>This month's packages were all compiled and installed on
Caldera 2.2. I haven't seen Red Hat 6.0 yet, but I will guess it
will have egcs, glibc-2.1 and a 2.2.x kernel. So, Red Hat users
will likely see the same things I have. Since these applications
were built on my system, they will most likely build on Red Hat,
the new Slackware system when it is released, SuSE and Debian. I no
longer offer any assurances about packages compiling on glibc-2.0.7
systems, since I no longer test them on that system.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>netsaint:</b></span><a href="http://netsaint.linuxbox.com" target="_self">http://netsaint.linuxbox.com/</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>netsaint</b></span> is a network
monitoring tool that can monitor network services and notify
administrators of problems via e-mail or page. Unlike the &ldquo;Big
Brother&rdquo; package
(<a href="http://maclawran.ca/bb-dnld" target="_self">http://maclawran.ca/bb-dnld/</a>),
netsaint doesn't require any client-side installations. Initial
installation and configuration can be difficult and would be
enhanced by a web configuration tool. Once installed, you can
review (but not change) the configuration from a web browser. The
current status is also monitored from the web browser. It requires
glibc, Apache (or another web server) and a (preferably graphical)
frames-capable web browser.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>UdmSearch:</b></span><a href="http://search.udm.net/about" target="_self">http://search.udm.net/about/</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>UdmSearch</b></span> is a web indexing
tool that uses MySQL to store words and references found on web
pages. It is extremely easy to configure and use. Searches are
quite fast, and common words to exclude can easily be added to the
package's list. It is also simple to embed the search function into
your own pages. The search function can use either
<span   class="bold"><b>php3</b></span> or a CGI program (both
included). Some preliminary results from large sites suggest that,
once indexed, this search tool offers a faster search engine for a
large web site than most native web sites have. It requires MySQL,
Apache with php3 compiled with MySQL support, glibc, libm, libnsl,
mysqlclient and a web browser.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>phpgen:</b></span><a href="http://www.byggsoft.se/~mikaelu" target="_self">http://www.byggsoft.se/~mikaelu/</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>phpgen</b></span> looks like a good
start toward automating the creation of
<span   class="bold"><b>php</b></span> web pages. Since much of this
type of code is repetitive and subject to error, phpgen could be a
welcome addition to your toolkit. It could use a few more
instructions on the web page where creation takes place, and maybe
a few more Themefiles, but the code is usable. It requires MySQL,
Apache with php3 compiled with MySQL support and a web
browser.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>stamos:</b></span><a href="http://privat.schlund.de/K/Knut_Grahlmann/english/stamos.html" target="_self">privat.schlund.de/K/Knut_Grahlmann/english/stamos.html</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>stamos</b></span> (some things about my
operating system) will display certain statistics about your
system, including OS version, RAM, load average, bogomips, uptime
(requires <span   class="bold"><b>uptimed</b></span>) and hard drive
usage. When run, stamos creates a web page with this information
nicely formatted. This Perl script reads uptimed and some /proc
files. It could easily be extended to provide more information, and
optimally, a way for root to change some of the proc files via the
web interface. It requires uptimed and Perl 5.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>quicklist:</b></span><a href="http://www.quicklist.org" target="_self">http://www.quicklist.org/</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>quicklist</b></span> is a working,
finished-looking start on a list maker. You can concoct address
books or phone lists and quickly be entering data. The lists are
saved as ASCII text files. Standard quicklist format is
backslash-separated data. You can also specify tab-separated,
comma-separated or HTML format for the file. The only annoying
thing I noticed was that the file extension used the abbreviated
&ldquo;.htm&rdquo; rather than the standard &ldquo;.html&rdquo;. Quicklist also had
trouble reading an .html file it wrote, although other file types
could be read just fine. A number of options remain to be
completed, but this package looks very promising. It requires
gtk+-1.2 (including gdk and glib), dl, Xext, X11, libm and
glibc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>stunnel:</b></span><a href="http://mike.daewoo.com.pl/computer/stunnel" target="_self">http://mike.daewoo.com.pl/computer/stunnel/</a></p><p>In the beginning was ssh, and ssh took care of secure TELNET
and FTP sessions. Now we have
<span   class="bold"><b>stunnel</b></span>, which is meant to
complement ssh. The stunnel program does not do TELNET or FTP, but
it does permit secure communications with SMTP servers, POP servers
and others. Note that the home page and FTP site are located in
Poland, so there is no hassle with US ITAR laws. When you build
stunnel, you can build it with either the ssleay library or the
openssl library. If you want stunnel to read your hosts.allow file,
you can also build it with libwrap, the tcp wrappers library. It
requires glibc, nsl, pthread, ssleay or openssl, and optionally,
libwrap.</p></div></div>
