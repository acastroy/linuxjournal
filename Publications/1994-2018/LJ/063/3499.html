    Linux has been embraced from the beginning by

the science labs of universities and the research departments of
both scientific and engineering companies. Schools and new
companies looking for their niche in the marketplace often have
restricted budgets and a need for highly robust systems. For both
these reasons, Linux has been embraced from the beginning by
research departments in universities, business and government.
</p><p>I have always had in interest in science. My degree is a B.S.
(math and physics), one of my hobbies is astronomy, my job for many
years was programming geophysical applications, and my husband is a
physicist. As a result, our Science &amp; Engineering issue is
always one of my favorites. I enjoy reading about the cool ways
Linux is being put to use in these fields. And this issue is no
exception&mdash;we even have an article about geophysics.</p><p>Ed Petron's article on teaching computers to think brings
science fiction to everyday reality. This new method of programming
is a quite a step from the usual algorithmic approach. Speaking of
science fiction, take a look at the pictures of Fermilab and the
great article by Jon Hall.</p><p>Inside, Wolf-Rainer Novender describes SCEPTRE, a simulation
tool for electric circuits, and on the Web, Alasdair McAndrew gives
us a comprehensive tutorial for the mathematical tool, MuPad. Also
in &ldquo;Strictly On-line&rdquo; are articles about using GPS technology to
do precision farming and calculating underground water quality
using parallel algorithms. Two unique uses of Linux that I would
never have dreamed up.</p><p>As long as students continue to be exposed to Linux at school
in their science labs, Linux will continue to make inroads into
engineering and scientific applications.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25bb580.0x26b34a8"></a>Caldera Lizard</h2></div></div><p>Ransom Love of Caldera dropped by our office in April to give
us a copy of their new release, OpenLinux 2.2. I installed it on a
test machine to see if the much-touted &ldquo;new and easy&rdquo; Lizard
install truly worked. Basically, it did, but I had one problem: the
install was hanging while probing for the SCSI device, a 2-channel
UW Adaptec on-board controller. A message from Caldera support
recommended I use the boot parameter
<b  >er=cautious</b>. I did, and it worked. I also had to
use the custom install option and define partitions, since the
machine I was using already had the Be OS installed. If the OS had
been Windows, Lizard would have automatically built the partitions
using PartitionMagic. Even with the custom install, the entire
procedure took about ten minutes and I had a working Linux system
with KDE, WordPerfect8, Star Office and other goodies. It was so
fast, that by the time it offered to let me play Tetris, the
installation was complete. When Linux detractors say Linux needs an
easy install, this is what they want. We'll have a full review next
month.</p><p>Marjorie Richardson, Editor in Chief</p></div></div>
