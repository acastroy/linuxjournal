over the Linux market. I feel compelled to point out a few
important points regarding Red Hat:</p><p>One, Red Hat Linux is GPL, which means they cannot squeeze
out <span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> distribution of Linux by introducing
proprietary system components. An excellent example is the RPM
system; anyone can incorporate a Red Hat package manager into their
system, and this is encouraged by Red Hat. Intel's investment in
Red Hat will be beneficial to all Linux users and
distributions.</p><p>Two, Red Hat is not out to crush competition. Red Hat
software has been used as the basis for new distributions such as
Linux-PRO. Anyone can freely download, use, modify, sell and
incorporate their work.</p><p>Three, Red Hat embraces new technologies, such as glibc,
before other commercial distributions. This may make certain
programs which use these technologies incompatible with other
distributions, but this isn't the fault of Red Hat. Other
distributions are just slower to adopt these non-proprietary
technologies.</p><p>Four, Red Hat isn't significantly harder to configure than
other Linux distributions. Everything is hard until you know how to
do it.</p><p>Five, no one forces anyone to use Red Hat. No one even tries
to do so.</p><p>I have had experience with Red Hat, SuSE, Caldera and
Slackware; I see strengths and weaknesses in each. Red Hat is not
my favorite distribution. However, it bothers me to see people
criticizing Red Hat and comparing them to Microsoft when to me most
of these criticisms are unwarranted.</p><p>&mdash;Michael O'Brien mobrien@unm.edu</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1936580.0x1a2e4a8"></a>gawk 3.1</h2></div></div><p>I read Juergen Kahrs' excellent article in the April 1999
issue, &ldquo;Network Administration with AWK&rdquo;, on using
<span   class="bold"><b>gawk</b></span> to access live net
connections as files. Now I am watching for the announcement of
gawk 3.1, which has the network features.</p><p>This article advertises gawk's net functions as a Swiss Army
knife for network administration, and one can easily see how it
would help with network monitoring, housekeeping, security and
optimization. Also hinted at in the article and dealt with in more
detail at
<a href="http://home.t-online.de/home/Juergen.Kahrs" target="_self">home.t-online.de/home/Juergen.Kahrs</a>
are many other selling points for gawk's net functions, such as
learning and prototyping artificial intelligence, agents and web
server functions.</p><p>It would be ideal if gawk was using callbacks internally
rather than looping to wait for activity. Is this what is meant by
the term &ldquo;non-blocking read&rdquo;? I would think wrappers of other
languages or mere shell functions might work for gawk 3.1's missing
features of broadcasting, non-blocking read, timeout and forking
server processes. Thanks.</p><p>&mdash;Bob recbo@erols.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1936580.0x1a2e768"></a>DOSEMU and Wine</h2></div></div><p>Although I am a new user of Linux, I have noticed a tendency
to either make applications that communicate well with Windows or
use emulators to run DOS-native programs. This seems to contradict
the philosophy behind Linux, to create a free operating system.
With the superior file system of Linux, why would people want to
run DOS or Windows programs? Some program managers have gone so far
as to use a Windows 9<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>-style toolbar. I think
programmers should be more original in program design.</p><p>&mdash;Matthew Stapleton bifflinux@juno.com</p><p>At present, this is a Windows world, so good communication
between Linux and Windows is a must. Many Windows and DOS
applications are not available for Linux, so fans of those programs
want emulators such as DOSEMU and Wine. Those same people want
their desktop to look familiar, so developers tend to provide
managers with which the user will be comfortable rather than
developing a completely new design &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1936580.0x1a2e978"></a>Music and Linux</h2></div></div><p>Great magazine! I'm a newcomer to Linux and it was quite
amazing to browse the magazine stand and find a
non-Microsoft/Apple-based magazine. I really enjoyed the interview
with John Ousterhout and the reviews. If I might make one request,
though: in all the documentation I've found, there's little to no
mention of the sound manipulation capabilities of Linux systems.
I'm a musician and have used quite a few good programs on the
Windows platform, but I can't seem to find anything similar on
Linux. If you could print an article on this subject, it would be
greatly appreciated by at least one person.</p><p>&mdash;Matt Nelson mnelson@nelcomail.com</p><p>A very good article on Linux and sound can be found in our
February 1999 issue: &ldquo;Csound for Linux&rdquo; by David Phillips. Also,
back in September 1998, we had a review of a music publisher called
MUP by Bob van der Poel &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1936580.0x1a2eb30"></a>Correction to grep Article</h2></div></div><p>In the syntax section of the April article &ldquo;grep: Searching
for Words&rdquo;, Jan Rooijackers mistakes shell expansion with regular
expressions. The grep command <b  >grep flip *</b> does
indeed use the regular expression &ldquo;flip&rdquo;, but it never sees the
*, as the shell has expanded that asterisk to be each file in the
directory. Mr. Rooijackers incorrectly explains that grep is using
the asterisk as a regular expression meaning all the files in the
directory.</p><p>&mdash;Michael Jones mjone4@amfam.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1936580.0x1a2ece8"></a>Minor Correction</h2></div></div><p><i  >Linux Journal</i> is amazing, and issue #60
was no exception. However, I'd like to point out a minor typing
mistake in the article &ldquo;Linux 2.2 and the Frame-Buffer Console&rdquo;;
the text says the frame buffer device files are /dev/fd*. Shouldn't
that be /dev/fb*?</p><p>&mdash;Celso Kopp Webber webber@sj.univali.rct-sc.br</p><p>Yes, you found a typo we missed. Thanks for pointing it
out &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1936580.0x1a2eef8"></a>URL in May 99</h2></div></div><p>I received my free issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> today and began reading the article &ldquo;Creat: An

http://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/uCinux/ for the Linux/Microcontroller
