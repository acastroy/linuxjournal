trade shows, COMDEX Spring and ISPCON, I can confirm what you
already know&mdash;the IT community has not only heard of Linux, but is
also embracing it. A major reason for this is the growing
prominence of Linux at trade shows. In Chicago, there were about 15
Linux-related exhibitors, a respectable number for a
non-Linux-specific show. Most ironic was the location of VA
Research (now VA Linux Systems) directly across from Linux Hardware
Solutions. The following week, the former acquired the latter for
an undisclosed price. Any cautions given at the show by Kit Cosper,
President of LHS, to put off purchasing decisions were well-heeded.

</p><p><i  >Linux Journal</i> and Linux International
sponsored an impressive pavilion and theater, with informative
presentations from companies such as Caldera, Cygnus and the always
entertaining &ldquo;BRU Guys&rdquo;. Also presenting was Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall,
who wasted no time in challenging the FUD (fear, uncertainty and
doubt) that was leaching from the Microsoft area of the show. All
of these talks were broadcast live on &ldquo;The Linux Show&rdquo;, an
Internet-based radio show about Linux (http://www.ttalk.com/).
Linus Torvalds drew an enthusiastic crowd of at least 300 while
being interviewed by Jeff Gerhardt, host of &ldquo;The Linux Show&rdquo;.
Kudos to Jeff for asking Linus to autograph his <i  >Linux Journal</i> hat.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3500f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>Obviously afraid of offending their largest exhibitor, the
folks at COMDEX were on a non-committal tightrope walk that proved
discouraging, and at times, offensive. As Doc Searls mentions in
his <span   class="emphasis"><em>Open Sources</em></span> review in this issue, the
drawing power of Linus Torvalds' keynote speech was obviously
underestimated. A standing-room-only crowd of 1200 included not
only those who wanted to learn more about Linux, but an impressive
number of media people who were there to cover the event as well.
The concept of the Gates keynote being pitted against the Torvalds
keynote was more a blatant effort on the part of COMDEX to draw
attention to the show than actual rivalry, although the idea of
showing up in a penguin costume during the Gates keynote crossed my
mind. With any luck, the lessons COMDEX learned from this show will
improve their treatment of the Linux crowd this fall in Las
Vegas.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3500f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Linux-friendly and knowledgeable crowd. <i  >Linux Journal</i> sponsored a &ldquo;Linux Luncheon&rdquo;, with Phil Hughes
challenging the crowd of 500 to answer Linux-related trivia
questions. Phil also moderated a discussion panel with
representatives from VA Linux Systems, Cobalt and Rebel.com's (name
subject to change) Netwinder division. It was good to see hardware
vendors getting along so nicely.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3500f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>The untold story behind all these trade shows is the folks
lucky enough to work them. Sure, they are grueling and expensive,
but at the same time, they give the feeling that you are a part of
something larger than yourself, an ambassador or spokesperson to
the uninitiated, unwashed masses. The Linux &ldquo;trade show circuit&rdquo;
has engendered family of its own, and always, for some unknown
reason, results in daily hangovers, not entirely caused by
&ldquo;virtual&rdquo; beer. What do we talk about after discussing Linux all
day? Linux, of course, and the nice part is that we are getting
paid for it&mdash;truly a dream job. Chicago also allowed me the
opportunity to have dinner with Linus Torvalds not once, but three
nights in a row. I will always remember, although a bit hazily,
sitting in Trader Vic's with Linus and maddog, drinking some
obnoxious concoction from a two-foot-long straw. What I can draw
from this experience is: don't challenge maddog to a drinking
contest&mdash;he will always win; $8 drinks should be bought only on a
company expense account; and the earliest we can expect to hear
something from Transmeta is this fall.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3500f7.large.jpg"><img src="3500f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>My fear for the future is that the growth of so many
Linux-related companies will result in less communication among the
people who drive each of them. The presidents and CEOs of these
companies are being replaced by self-proclaimed &ldquo;booth bimbos&rdquo;.
There is something to be said for an evening I spent at a
restaurant in Chicago. Joining me were folks from Red Hat, SuSE and
Caldera, all of us sharing a pitcher of beer. Trade shows are, in a
sense, the only chance we get to have a Linux &ldquo;company&rdquo; meeting.
It is my hope that with the growth of these companies, the
importance of the trade show in maintaining and promoting a feeling
of community will not be lost.</p></div></div>
