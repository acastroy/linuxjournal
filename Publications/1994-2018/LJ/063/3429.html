    One man's experience with installing, configuring and running
    Linux on a laptop computer.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad8580.0xbd0450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Linux is known to be a stable operating
system that does an excellent job of managing the PC's hardware.
With that comes the challenge of getting Linux to work properly on
some hardware. One particular example is getting Linux to work on
laptops. Some brands can be tough to configure, while others are a
piece of cake. A particular brand of laptop that works great with
Linux is the IBM Thinkpad series. It can be hard to get working at
first, especially the X Window System. I am a happy user of Linux
on my IBM Thinkpad 750Cs, and this article is a description of what
I did to get Linux functioning perfectly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad8580.0xbd0558"></a>The Hardware</h2></div></div><p>The IBM Thinkpad 750Cs has an Intel 80486 DX processor. The
750Cs has approximately 20MB of memory and 330MB of hard drive
space. The hard drive and floppy drive are both made specifically
for IBM. The floppy drive is a 2.88MB drive which shows up in a few
Thinkpads, and the video card is a VGA card. These hardware specs
are important to know for someone who will be configuring
Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad8580.0xbd0660"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>I am using Red Hat Linux 5.1 with kernel version 2.0.35.
Installing this version of Linux went smoothly. I downloaded the
boot and root disk installation images and put them on two
floppies. I used a Backpack, 4x speed external CD-ROM drive from
Microsolutions Inc. for the installation. The installation program
is capable of finding this drive, so that made the rest of the
installation run without problems. My only difficulty was with
X.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad8580.0xbd0768"></a>The Thinkpad Floppy Problem</h2></div></div><p>The Thinkpad floppy drive has an inverted disk change sensor
that Linux doesn't automatically support. Thus, in order to fix
this, I had to pass <b  >floppy=thinkpad</b> to the
kernel at the LILO boot prompt. This must be done for the
installation to complete properly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad8580.0xbd08c8"></a>X Window System</h2></div></div><p>Getting X to work on my 750Cs was the toughest part. The
problem lies in the 75xCs series of Thinkpads and their dual-scan
monitors. X starts, but displays only a black screen with an
occasional vertical line. The only way around this problem is to
use a program, written by Michael Steiner, that disables the upper
512K of video memory. This program can be downloaded from
http://www.zurich.ibm.com/~sti/tplinux.html. After downloading it,
I ran <span   class="bold"><b>xf86config</b></span> and chose the
smallest option for the monitor and a standard VGA card. Since the
video card is a VGA card, the only server available is XF86_VGA16.
Then Michael Steiner's program must be enabled once before starting
X. Use the following command: <b  >tpdualscan -e</b>.
Note that when the problem first occurred, pressing
<b  >ctrl-alt-delete</b> wouldn't shut down the computer
under that black screen. First, I had to end X by pressing
<b  >ctrl-alt-backspace</b>, then
<b  >ctrl-alt-delete</b> to shut down my computer,
eliminating the black screen.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad8580.0xbd0b88"></a>PCMCIA</h2></div></div><p>Linux supports the Thinkpad's PCMCIA slots perfectly, and
since my individual cards were supported, I had no problem here. I
personally recommend 3Com's Etherlink III 3c589D card for Ethernet
networking, because <span   class="bold"><b>cardmgr</b></span> found
this card easily and it works fine. I didn't have to edit any of
the PCMCIA configuration files.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad8580.0xbd0ce8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The two main problems with the Thinkpad are the floppy drive
and the XFree86 problem. Linux supports the rest of the computer
perfectly. Problems with other Thinkpads shouldn't be too hard to
fix, and Michael Steiner's web page is a good place to start for
help.</p></div></div>
