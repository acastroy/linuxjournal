Don't throw away that old laptop; use it as a mobile
VoIP and Web server.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xef4580.0xfec240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Resourceful people can use an old desktop as a server of some sort,
but they also may have an old laptop around collecting dust. Although most of today's
desktop environment software runs too slowly on these older laptops,
you may not want to get rid of yours yet. These cast-offs easily
can be transformed not only into a low-power server, but also into a mobile
VoIP and Web server.
</p><p>
Let's look a three Linux distros with this in mind and test two different
Web servers. The Ye Old Laptop used in this article is a Dell Latitude with
a 1.0GHz Intel Pentium III Mobile CPU and 256MB of RAM. Keep in mind
that Web 2.0 software may be too much for these old cast-offs. So, if
you need to serve the latest-and-greatest flashy content, you're better
off buying a new desktop computer. The server configuration I used and
tested on every Linux distribution is Apache 1.3.34, Lighttpd 1.4.13,
PHP 5 and MySQL Server 5.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xef4580.0xfec450"></a>
Xubuntu 7.04</h2></div></div><p>
Xubuntu is an official Ubuntu distribution for old or slow systems. The
main difference between it and Ubuntu is that Xubuntu uses the Xfce window
manager instead of GNOME. An X-less Ubuntu or Kubuntu installation should
have the same performance results as an X-less Xubuntu. With X running,
Xubuntu requires at least 128MB of RAM, but the minimum requirements for
the Xubuntu Alternate CD without X are 64MB of RAM. It uses the Ubuntu
repositories, which are filled with programs that satisfy nearly every
system administrator's needs. I installed Apache 1.3 and Lighttpd 1.4,
MySQL Server 5 and PHP 5 with <tt  >apt-get install apache
lighttpd</tt> and <tt  >apt-get
install mysql-server-5.0 php5</tt>. For some reason, I had to install Apache
2.0 (and all its dependencies) to get PHP to work with Apache 1.3. After
I got it working, I then uninstalled Apache 2.0.
</p><p>
After configuring Apache and Lighttpd, I stress-tested the Web server
over a 100Mb Ethernet connection with Siege, a benchmarking and
HTTP regression-testing utility. It is designed to let Web developers
measure the performance of both their code and their servers to see
how well the server functions on the Internet under a heavy load. Siege
supports basic authentication, the HTTP and HTTPS protocols, and even
cookies. This utility allows system administrators to hit their Web
server with both a concurrent and configurable number of simulated users.
</p><p>
I generated a 5KB file with dd and ran a stress test with <tt  >siege
192.168.1.179/5kb -c10 -r10</tt> on a fairly new computer, simulating ten
clients refreshing ten times each second (a fairly heavy load). To
improve results, I turned off all unneeded services, including Xorg,
Samba, the FTP server and the IRC server. If you run Siege with the
-b command-line argument, it runs the test without any delay for
throughput benchmarking. This means that the server gets all the
hits at once (but that isn't a very realistic scenario). Without the
-b flag, Siege invokes each simulated user with a delay of at least
one second. Table 1 shows the performance differences between Apache
1.3 and Lighttpd 1.4.13.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0xef4580.0xfec710"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. Performance Differences between Apache 1.3 and Lighttpd

The tests performed on Xubuntu 7.04 (Table 1) reveal that the
transaction rate is high, and the shortest transfer time is about
a millisecond or less. (Siege can't calculate anything below a
millisecond.) This is mainly because my network consists of only 20
feet of cable. Depending on your connection, testing over the Internet
will show a greater latency than over a local network. According to
the Siege man page, concurrency is the average number of simultaneous
connections. When the number rises, the server performance decreases,
especially on slower hardware.

The tests performed on the 1MB file (Table 2) show that under a
heavy load, Lighttpd 1.4.13 performs the best with smaller files (such
as blog posts without any pictures). Performance, however, is still
higher than Apache with 5KB files. Interestingly, the heavier the load,
the better Apache performed. Results from tests on 5MB files under a
very heavy load of 50 clients at ten connections per second showed a
0.1 second higher response time and a 0.1MB/sec higher throughput than
Lighttpd. Lighttpd still had shorter transaction times that were four
seconds less than Apache though.
</p><p>
On Xubuntu, Lighttpd is the fastest performing server for static
documents,
although Apache follows close behind. For best results in Xubuntu, turn off
all unneeded services, so that if the server gets a heavy load, it will
have a few more resources to improve speed. I found Xubuntu to be quite
fast and easy to get running, but there are other distros to consider,
such as Vector Linux.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xef4580.0xfe4de0"></a>
Vector Linux 5.8</h2></div></div><p>
Vector Linux is another distro tuned for slower systems. It is based
on Slackware 11, but unlike Slackware, Vector strives to retain legacy
drivers for very old hardware. Its forum actively supports users of
equipment that is considered to be outdated. It is even used for software
development and Web serving, even though the distribution's focus is on
the desktop environment.
</p><p>
Vector Linux comes with Slapt-get, an apt-like package manager for
Slackware-based systems, by default. It is quite compatible with most
Slackware packages on <a href="http://linuxpackages.net" target="_self">linuxpackages.net</a>, so installing Web server
software is quite straightforward. I couldn't get a package list from
Linux Packages (at the time of this writing), so I gave up and compiled
Apache, Lighttpd, PHP and MySQL from scratch. I copied over the Apache
and Lighttpd configuration files from Xubuntu and made sure everything
was working. Then, I fired up Siege and stress-tested it.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0xef4580.0xfe4f98"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 3. Performance Differences between Apache 1.3 and Lighttpd

Similar to the results with Xubuntu, Lighttpd is a clear leader
in speed on Vector Linux as well (Table 3). On Vector Linux,
Lighttpd has a noticeably higher transaction rate than Apache, and
Apache's longest transaction is practically three seconds slower than
Lighttpd's! Throughput is just a tiny bit greater with Lighttpd than with
Apache, and the concurrency is shockingly low. This speed gap closes when
Lighttpd is presented with a 1MB file. Just like working with Xubuntu,
you should turn off any unneeded services and even cron jobs in Vector
Linux for optimal performance.

Lighttpd on Vector Linux is the fastest performing server for static
documents (Table 4). Apache follows with good results. Results
from tests on 5MB files also under a considerably heavy load of 50
clients at ten connections per second showed that Apache had an average
response time about 150 milliseconds faster than Lighttpd. Lighttpd and
Apache had nearly equal transaction rates and throughput, but Lighttpd's
concurrency was higher than Apache's. Interestingly, Lighttpd's longest
transaction time was a full ten seconds shorter than Apache's!
</p><p>
Slackware is often known for its almost legendary server qualities,
and it appears that Vector Linux measures up to them. What happens
though, when you go even smaller&mdash;as small as the 50MB Damn Small Linux?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xef4580.0x12fa320"></a>
Damn Small Linux 3.3</h2></div></div><p>
Damn Small Linux (DSL) is known for its small size and for running well
on slower systems. It also has the apt package manager. With the right
apt repository, you can practically turn DSL into a full-fledged distro!
It was designed to run on very old hardware, including processors such
as the 386, 486, Pentium, Pentium II, Pentium III and the older AMD
equivalents. Unlike Vector Linux and Xubuntu, DSL uses the
&ldquo;classic&rdquo;
2.4 Linux kernel and BusyBox, rather than the 2.6 kernel and the GNU
utilities. Like Knoppix, it is designed to run off a Live CD (or USB
thumbdrive), but it serves as an excellent desktop operating system
too&mdash;if you don't mind using older versions of your frequently used
software.
</p><p>
DSL is somewhat crippled for anything but Web browsing and music
playing. To use DSL as a server OS, you will need to install the GNU
utilities by selecting Apps&rarr;Tools&rarr;Upgrade to GNU Utils in the System
menu. This will make the DSL system more fully GNU-compatible. If you
plan to use apt, you need to click on Apps&rarr;Tools&rarr;Enable Apt in the
System menu. Now that the GNU utilities are installed, you can install
Apache or Lighttpd. I recommend compiling everything&mdash;PHP, MySQL and
the http server&mdash;from scratch. Although this takes some time and
effort, it
is far less complex than trying to get everything working correctly with
apt or MyDSL (Damn Small Linux's own spartan package system). By compiling
the Web software from source, you have complete feature control as well.
</p><p>
For those who don't need or want Apache 1.3, the XAMPP Project has a
completely configured and working standalone Apache 2, MySQL and PHP
binary package that can install anywhere on the system.

The speed difference between Apache and Lighttpd is quite noticeable (Table 5); Apache is clearly the faster of the two. I used the Apache
package in the MyDSL package manager though, which could be optimized
for older systems. Interestingly, Apache had a higher transaction rate
than Lighttpd did. It also had quite a low concurrency. Although Apache
is noticeably faster than Lighttpd, the hardware constraints of the
laptop make any Web server lousy at anything but small files under a
heavy load. However, it could serve small blogs or PHP, Perl, Ruby and
Python scripts under a medium load without getting too overloaded.
</p><p>
Although it may seem like Lighttpd is slacking off on the first test,
when it has to pull a load, it does it efficiently.

Shortest transaction</td><td>0.08 secs</td><td>0.08 secs</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
Test results show (Table 6) that Lighttpd quickly regained its
customary speed over Apache. Lighttpd's average response time is only
a fraction faster than Apache's, but the transaction rate is almost a
full megabyte per second more than Apache's. Lighttpd, however, has a
higher concurrency, but that didn't pose a problem when I ran a test
with 50 clients connecting ten times a second, as Lighttpd was still
faster. Running this test on a 5MB file returned very disappointing
results. Apache had the lowest of the longest transaction times but was
otherwise the same as Lighttpd in throughput and transaction rates.
</p><p>
Overall, DSL is the smallest of the three distros tested in this
article. When fleshed out with Apache/Lighttpd, GNU and other server
utilities, the disk space used is less than 100MB. In general, Lighttpd and
Apache on Damn Small Linux tie in practically every aspect. You will
notice some minor speed improvements with X turned off, and although there
aren't many, you still may want to turn off all unneeded services. In
these days of broadband, even a quarter of a second can be a quarter
second too slow. Damn Small Linux may seem like a strange distribution
to use as a server OS, but there is no real reason why it can't be used
as one&mdash;it's just one of the few actively developed distros that uses
the 2.4 Linux. Like all distros, DSL needs to be tweaked so that you
can get the most out of it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xef4580.0x15780a8"></a>
Getting the Most out of the Server</h2></div></div><p>
Configuration is everything in a server. To milk some more speed from
your server, you will want to configure it to your needs. Turn off all
server modules you don't plan to use. Apache limits the number of users
that can connect to the server at one time to around 5,000 clients. For
a laptop with such limited capacities as the one used in this article,
you most likely will want to lower this to 500&ndash;1,000 clients, depending
on what kind of content you will be serving. For best results, eliminate
unneeded features from the SQL Server and languages such as PHP, Python,
Ruby or Perl, by recompiling from source, if need be.
</p><p>
SQL Servers can be resource hogs, so if you want to extract the most
speed from your computer, you should configure the SQL Server to
your needs. Both PostgreSQL and MySQL have pages on speed optimization
on their Web sites (see Resources). In
addition to functioning as Web servers, old laptops are great Voice-over-IP servers as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xef4580.0x1578208"></a>
TeamSpeak</h2></div></div><p>
TeamSpeak is proprietary VoIP software that works similarly
to a telephone conference call. Like IRC, users connect to a
TeamSpeak server and join different chat channels. Its primary target
audience is gamers, but it can be used for meetings and discussions or
just to chat. Unlike Asterisk, TeamSpeak was designed for networked
computer-to-computer voice calls, and it does not interact with the SIP
protocol or any type of phone. It has similarities to IRC, such as channel
administrators, protected channels and voiced channels. TeamSpeak can
give various abilities and privileges to clients, ranging from server
administrators who control the way the server or channel operates
to anonymous users who have no privileges and can only chat.
</p><p>
The TeamSpeak Web site explains that the current game communication
services, such as Roger Wilco or Microsoft's GameVoice, did not fulfill the
creators' needs. Some of the primary problems with these services are the
lack of Linux compatibility and the issues with high-bandwidth utilization
and routers. The TeamSpeak server, however, runs with surprisingly low
system requirements&mdash;a minimum of 32MB of RAM and a 100MHz CPU. With
TeamSpeak on a laptop, you can have a LAN party and move from house to
house to improve team communication while playing games such as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Warsow</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tremulous</em></span> or even console games. Another possibility is to meet with a
few people at someone's house and have a meeting over the Internet with
a few others around the planet.
</p><p>
Installing TeamSpeak on Xubuntu, Vector Linux and DSL was a piece
of cake. I downloaded the server from its Web site, but ran into
some dependency problems. I then stumbled across a how-to on the site
that gave me a link to a version on an FTP site and included
dependencies.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xef4580.0x1578470"></a>
Which Distribution and Server Is Best?</h2></div></div><p>
In the Open Source world, myriad choices exist. The tests performed
in this article cover different file sizes on two different Web servers
running on three different Linux distributions.
</p><p>
The winner for the 1MB file tests is Lighttpd on Vector Linux. The
transaction rate was an average of ten transactions per second and a
throughput of 9.7MB per second. Damn Small Linux came in second place
with an average of 9.3 transactions per second and a throughput of 9MB
per seconds.
</p><p>
The competition for the 5KB file resulted in a tie between Apache on
DSL and Lighttpd on Vector Linux. Both Lighttpd and Apache had average
transaction rates of 14.2 transactions per second on Vector Linux and
DSL, respectively. Throughput was the same for Apache on DSL as it was
for Lighttpd on Vector Linux, weighing in at 0.07MB per second.
</p><p>
So, with all the different options and servers, making a selection boils
down to three criteria: your machine, your needs and your abilities. When
it comes to servers, Apache is an 800-pound gorilla that can do
almost anything. Its extensibility through a variety of modules has made
it the most common Web server on the market. If you're not looking to run
a hosting service for Web developers on a laptop, Lighttpd's smaller size
and simplicity could fill the bill. When it comes to Linux distributions,
the three factors to take into consideration are size, simplicity
and speed. If you are looking for speed, explore Vector Linux. If ease
and simplicity are your highest priorities, try Xubuntu. If space is a
problem, consider Damn Small Linux.
</p><p>
If you want a the fastest Web server that is also mobile, combine
TeamSpeak with Lighttpd on Vector Linux. If you want to display LAN-party score results or serve pictures and short videos while maintaining
communication with teammates anywhere in the world, or if you want to
have a central meeting place and wiki or content management system with a
few people around the globe, then Lighttpd, TeamSpeak and Vector Linux
are right for the job.
</p><p>
Even though they have slower hardware, old laptops definitely can be used
in place of desktops&mdash;so long as you don't expect very heavy loads.
Figure out
your priorities of speed, simplicity and size in distributions; then
simplicity or speed in servers; and finally, simplicity, frugality and
speed in VoIP. Resurrect ye old laptop, blow off the dust, and give it
new purpose in life.
