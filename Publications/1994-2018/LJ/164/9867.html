Back in the summer of 2005, id Software released the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake
3</em></span> engine to
the public under the GPL license. For open-source enthusiasts, it was
amazing news, but to the general public, it seemed like mostly marketing
nonsense. Releasing the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake 3</em></span> engine, unfortunately, wasn't the same
as releasing the game, so the average gamer didn't gain
anything&mdash;at least, not at first. In this article, I introduce some great
new games that use the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake 3</em></span> engine. They're all free,
and they all run natively under Linux.
</p><p>
First, let's talk about what id Software really did when it released the
engine under the GPL. As Linux users, we're familiar with terms
like, &ldquo;Free as in speech and free as in beer&rdquo;. For the record, I have
never understood the latter part of that motto. Beer is rarely free.
Nonetheless, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake 3</em></span> engine is indeed free in several ways:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The program is free to download. You don't have to pay for it, and
it's not crippled in any way whatsoever. You can give it to your
friends,
for free, and you won't be a pirate. (This is the &ldquo;free as in
beer&rdquo; part.)
</p></li><li><p>
The program is free to modify, change, repackage and even
sell&mdash;provided you include your source code. (This is the
&ldquo;free as in speech&rdquo;
part.)
</p></li><li><p>
The engine is not the whole game. You can't install the program
and expect to frag your little brother in the next room. The graphics,
models, maps and such are not free. If you distribute those things
(from the retail <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake 3</em></span> CD), you, in fact, will be a pirate. That part
is not free.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I tried to explain the significance of releasing the engine to 
non-techie friends of mine, but, alas, they had no idea what I was talking
about. So, for those of you who have never really understood the whole
game engine versus actual game thing, check out the 
&ldquo;Grandma's GPL Cookie Recipe&rdquo; sidebar.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb8d580.0xc85be0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Grandma's GPL Cookie Recipe</b></p><p>
When id Software released the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake 3</em></span> engine in the summer of 2005, it
wasn't the same as releasing the entire game for free. It was more like
Grandma giving you her cookie recipe. Let's say Grandma had an
incredible cookie recipe, and she sold cookies like crazy for five years.
After five years, Grandma decided to give away her recipe. Sure, you could
make your own cookies based on Grandma's recipe, but Grandma didn't
actually send you any cookies in the mail. In fact, Grandma still sold
her cookies, and people bought them.
</p><p>
The great part is that not only can you take Grandma's recipe, you
can add to it. You can make your own cookies and base the recipe on
what Grandma gave you. That's pretty much what happened with the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake 3</em></span>
engine. The only caveat with releasing a new cookie recipe is that you
need to include your recipe for free as well. And, that's just how
Grandma wants it.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb8d580.0xc85ef8"></a>
My Gaming System</h2></div></div><p>
Before I begin talking about the games, I have a few confessions to make. First,
I'm not a gamer. I am the player you want on the opposite team in pretty
much any gaming situation. I'm horrible. Second, my computer is just
about as adept at gaming as I am. Here are the specs:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Pentium 4 2.4GHz
</p></li><li><p>
Onboard Intel 915 graphics (shared 8MB memory)
</p></li><li><p>
20GB IDE hard drive
</p></li><li><p>
512MB of RAM
</p></li><li><p>
Ubuntu Linux 7.04
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I chose Ubuntu because it's very common and easy to use. It doesn't
really matter what distribution you have; they'll all work, but some of
my examples might not look exactly the same. I'll try to be as generic
as possible.
</p><p>
One key issue with getting any 3-D game working is to make sure you're
using an accelerated driver in the X Window System. It's possible your computer
already has this. A simple way to check is to open a terminal window
and type:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# glxinfo | grep endering &lt;enter&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb8d580.0xc864d0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And, look for:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# direct rendering: Yes
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb8d580.0xc86630"></a></h2></div></div><p>
(I purposefully left off the r in the grep statement, in case
the word Rendering happened to be capitalized.) If you don't have
direct rendering, you need to configure your video card for
acceleration before you can run any of the games covered in this
article.
In my case, I had to change my video driver to &ldquo;intel&rdquo;
instead of &ldquo;i810&rdquo;.
You might have to do some research on the type of card you have.
Most semi-modern video cards are capable of acceleration in Linux,
so it likely will be worth the effort. Now that you (hopefully)
have your video system running properly, let's get down to the games!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb8d580.0xc86840"></a>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Open Arena</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
This first game is basically an attempt to re-create <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake
3 Arena</em></span>, but with free graphics, models and so on. If you
ever played <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake
3 Arena</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Open Arena</em></span> will look very
familiar. Because it uses the new-and-improved engine (ioQuake3, based
on the original <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake 3</em></span> engine),
I think it's actually more fun than the original. Don't tell id.
</p><p>
For Ubuntu users, simply
type the following to install <span   class="emphasis"><em>Open Arena</em></span>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# sudo apt-get install openarena
</pre>
</p><p>
If you are using a distribution that doesn't have a package available, you
can download the zip file from <a href="http://www.openarena.ws" target="_self">www.openarena.ws</a>, and follow
the simple directions for installation. (Basically, unzip the files,
and start the executable for your architecture. It's pretty simple.)
</p><p>
Once you start the game, you first need to configure things.
Because my video card is on the slow side of pokey, I set my resolution to
640x480, and most of the other details to low. Unlike some of the
other games, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Open Arena</em></span> has a single-player version. That's great news
for me, because on the &ldquo;I Can Win&rdquo; setting, I actually can do fairly well.
Figure 1 shows a screenshot of me dying (note that most of the screenshots in
this article are of me dying&mdash;I'll pretend it's on purpose).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9867f1.large.jpg"><img src="9867f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Shawn Dying in <span  class="emphasis"><em>Open Arena</em></span>
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Open Arena</em></span> is fun. It's fast, simple and you get to blow stuff up.
Even though the game says it requires 16MB of video RAM, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Open
Arena</em></span> ran
extremely well on my 8MB system. It's the kind of game you can actually
play during a television commercial and frag 20 people (or get fragged 20
times) before the show starts again.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb8d580.0x107f328"></a>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Urban Terror</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Urban Terror</em></span> started as a game mod for the original
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake 3</em></span>. I actually
played it back when it required <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake 3</em></span>, and apart from being more mature,
the game play is very similar. The difference, of course, is that now
it runs on the open-source ioQuake3 engine, so it's completely free.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Urban Terror</em></span> is designed to take the
first-person-shooter-type game
into an urban landscape. As creepy as that sounds, it actually makes
for some interesting maps and allows for realistic firearms.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Urban Terror</em></span> has the least-friendly Linux installer. If you read the
installation instructions closely enough, it's not too difficult, but my
suggestion is to use the handy-dandy installation script available on
the forums (see Resources). One important installation note is that if you run the installer
as root, the game will be accessible by all the users on your computer.
It's also important to follow the directions on the forum post. If you
do so, it will download all the needed files, create icons and download
some common maps.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Urban Terror</em></span> is a multiplayer game. Generally, this means you play
on-line or set up a server and play on your local network. It is possible
(although unsupported) to add bots to your server, so in theory, you
could play alone. Not all maps support bots, and bots tend to cause
random crashes. If you're like me, however, and can't hack it against
real people on the Internet, it might be worth the effort. Because bots
aren't officially supported, I'll leave it to the reader to add them (see
Resources).
</p><p>
It's a little more complicated to jump into an <span   class="emphasis"><em>Urban
Terror</em></span> game than
playing a quick game of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Open Arena</em></span>. The weapon selection is done at the
beginning of a round, and without doing some research, it's hard to tell
which guns are best. I tend to stick with the default choice. I also
tend to get shot a lot, so the default weapons might not be the best bet.
Figure 2 shows an example of the realistic maps in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Urban
Terror</em></span>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9867f2.large.jpg"><img src="9867f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. <span  class="emphasis"><em>Urban Terror</em></span>'s Realistic Maps
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb8d580.0x107fb10"></a>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tremulous</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tremulous</em></span> is an interesting game. It's kind of a
cross between a first-person-shooter and a real-time strategy game.
Although the game is played
in first person, and indeed, you frag the other team, you also build
devices and set up bases. Unlike most other first-person-shooter games,
the two races in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tremulous</em></span> are drastically different. The humans are,
well, humans. The aliens, however, are spider-like and tend to attack
without weapons. The idea behind <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tremulous</em></span> is really remarkable, and
the two separate races make for radically different game play.
</p><p>
This is another game that is simple to install on Ubuntu. All it takes
is a quick:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# sudo apt-get install tremulous
</pre>
</p><p>
If you have a different distribution, <a href="http://www.tremulous.net" target="_self">www.tremulous.net</a> supplies a
generic installer. Honestly, installing <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tremulous</em></span> is painless.
I wish I could say the same about actually playing the game.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tremulous</em></span> is hard&mdash;really, really, really hard. Unfortunately, there
is no single-player version, nor is there any support for bots. The only
way to play <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tremulous</em></span> is against other people. Other people, as a group,
all tend to be better than I am. I played for more than an hour, both as a
human and as an alien, and I didn't get a single kill&mdash;not a single one.
</p><p>
I'm sure there are other folks who understand the game better than I do,
and I know there are other people who can play the game better than I do.
Sadly, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tremulous</em></span> is the game I was most excited about, and the game I
enjoyed the least. No matter what race I chose, or what character I
chose to play, I just couldn't get the hang of playing. Figure 3 shows
me dying. So does Figure 4.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>World of Padman</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
The last game on the list has many similarities to the first. <span   class="emphasis"><em>World of
Padman</em></span> has the same sort of fast-action and easy-to-learn features that
make <span   class="emphasis"><em>Open Arena</em></span> so great. The interesting twist is
that <span   class="emphasis"><em>World of Padman</em></span> is staged
in a cartoon-like, oddly proportioned environment. All the players
are tiny mouse-sized, and the &ldquo;maps&rdquo; are generally rooms in a house.
I absolutely love the graphics, and apart from a few annoyances, it is
easily the most visually appealing of the four.
</p><p>
Although <span   class="emphasis"><em>World of Padman</em></span> isn't distributed as a package for
Ubuntu, the installer is very easy to use. On its Web site,
<a href="http://www.worldofpadman.com" target="_self">www.worldofpadman.com</a>, it even offers a live DVD version of
the game. (Actually, several games are on the DVD.) Once the
installer was done, I did have one small issue. It wouldn't start.
When I started from the command line, I could see the game was complaining
it didn't have libvorbisfile installed. After I installed it
(<tt  >sudo
apt-get install libvorbisfile3</tt>), the game started just fine. I was
a little surprised the installer didn't check for stuff like that,
but all in all, it wasn't too hard to fix.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>World of Padman</em></span> is demanding on the video card. Even with details and
resolution turned way down, I still could tell the video card was holding
me back. In high-action scenes, like the one shown in Figure 5, the screen started to
stutter. As the requirements mention a need for a 128MB OpenGL video
card, I guess I can't complain that my 8MB shared memory video was a
bit underpowered. The game was still very playable, even with my system.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9867f5.large.jpg"><img src="9867f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. High-Action Scene in <span  class="emphasis"><em>World of Padman</em></span>
</p></div></div><p>
This game is pure fun. The weapons range from a water-balloon launcher
to a bubble-gum gun. The maps are extremely detailed and enjoyable to
explore. My only real complaint is with the pictures on the main menu
and on the loading screen. A game that would otherwise be perfect for
young gamers quickly becomes inappropriate due to the sexually explicit
cartoons. If there were a G-rated version of the game, I would 
install it for my kids to play and use it for the after-school
gaming club at our school. Unfortunately, it's a little to risqu&eacute; for
such an environment.
</p><p>
Also, although the single-player mode isn't yet complete, <span   class="emphasis"><em>World of
Padman</em></span> has excellent bots. If you have a poor Internet connection or poor gaming skills, it's possible to have tons of fun with a local
server full of bots. Honestly though, <span   class="emphasis"><em>World of
Padman</em></span> is easy enough that while
playing on-line, I actually fared quite well. Although I really enjoyed
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Open Arena</em></span>, I think <span   class="emphasis"><em>World of
Padman</em></span> might be my favorite game
of the bunch.
