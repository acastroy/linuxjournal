<span   class="emphasis"><em>Beginning Game Development with Python and Pygame: From Novice to
Professional</em></span> by Will McGugan (Apress)</h2></div></div><p>
Our poor monthly book selections were bumped last month by the LinuxWorld
announcement binge, so let's get back to it. Apress has a fun new
book out: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Beginning Game Development with Python and Pygame:
From Novice to Professional</em></span> by Will McGugan. The idea is to train the
budding game developer (but not Python expert) as both a game creator
and proficient user of Python and the Pygame games development library.
In creating your own tank warfare game, you learn how to deal with gaming
preferences, sound, visual effects, keyboard/joystick interactions,
multiple platform issues and so on.

Attensa's Feed Server Virtual Appliance</h2></div></div><p>
Making RSS a snap is the idea behind the new Feed Server Virtual Appliance
from Attensa. Essentially, Attensa has merged its existing Feed
Server&mdash;an application for complete management of enterprise-wide RSS
coordination&mdash;with the rPath Linux-based virtual appliance platform. The virtual
appliance format, says Attensa, simplifies the hassles of installation,
integration, maintenance and administration. A free trial version of
the Feed Server is available at Attensa's Web site.

2X's ThinClientServer</h2></div></div><p>
The company 2X is touting its new ThinClientServer 5 as not just a
secure and cost-efficient solution but an environmentally friendly one
as well. 2X claims that the thin-client model utilizes up to 50% less
electricity than its fatter counterpart. ThinClientServer 5 deploys a
small-footprint, always-up-to-date, Linux-based OS to popular thin-client
devices. Some of Version 5's new features include full redundancy of
configuration and settings, load balancing and high availability for
PXE booting, ThinClientOS USB disk boot and installer, and Jetdirect
print-server support. A free trial version is available on 2X's Web site.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>Zimbra: Implement, Administer and Manage</em></span> by Marty Resnick (Packt
Publishing)</h2></div></div><p>
The nifty Zimbra messaging and collaboration suite now has the honor of
its own book, namely Packt Publishing's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Zimbra: Implement, Administer and
Manage</em></span> by Marty Resnick. The book shows how to install and configure
the multiplatform and open-source Zimbra server for use with Zimbra's
Ajax Web client, Outlook and mobile devices. Some of the topics covered
include application architecture, administration, security and
Zimlets&mdash;the mashups that make Zimbra so unique and cool.

MontaVista's Mobilinux</h2></div></div><p>
MontaVista has high hopes for its new Mobilinux 5.0, a mobile operating
system used in a large number of Linux-based smartphones. The company
says that Version 5.0, with its sophisticated development environment,
will allow manufacturers to create new mobile devices (such as, phone
handsets, GPS devices and wireless POS terminals) to consumers more quickly.
Key highlights of this upgrade include NSA-level mobile security using
MicroSELinux, dynamic power management, built-in connectivity (SDIO,
Wi-Fi and so on), integrated real-time response, quick startup (less than seconds),
smaller footprint, and support for multicore processors and the Linux
2.6.21 kernel. The first platforms supported will be Texas Instruments'
OMAP 2430 and 3430, followed by six additional platforms in early 2008.

Anawiki Games' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Path of Magic</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
It always has been tough for small games publishers from outside
the US to make their mark on our shores. Shipping boxes of air for
mafia-controlled shelf space at CompUSA is no way to make a living.
Thanks to the Internet, you can download cool (and Linux-based) games
from publishers like Poland's Anawiki Games. Anawiki's new adventure
is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Path of Magic</em></span>, sequel to its previous
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Runes of Magic</em></span>. Playable
without its predecessor, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Path of Magic</em></span> is a puzzle-driven game with
more than 51 challenging levels, six image puzzles and two bonus games. The
main character Evelyne continues her quest through Avalon and must find
her way home on the &ldquo;Path of Magic&rdquo;. 3-D-accelerated OpenGL is required.

Intel's LessWatts.org</h2></div></div><p>
LessWatts.org is a new green project plus Web site from the Open Source
Technology Center at Intel. The mission is to create &ldquo;a community
around saving power on Linux by bringing developers, users and sysadmins
together to share software, optimizations, tips and tricks&rdquo;. The site
covers mobile devices, desktops and servers and uses both software and
hardware solutions to reduce power consumption. One example of available
solutions is PowerTOP, a tool for assessing how well a system is doing
at saving power and which components are &ldquo;misbehaving&rdquo; while the computer
is idle.

Arcom's TITAN PC/104 PXA270 Single-Board Computer</h2></div></div><p>
Arcom's new arrival is its TITAN PC/104 PXA270 single-board computer.
TITAN is based on the Intel 520MHz PXA270 XScale RISC processor and
is targeted at ultra-low-power, fanless embedded systems. Typical
consumption is merely 1.5W, and additional dynamically adjusted sleep
modes to reduce its power needs further are supported. The TITAN has
ready-to-run development kits for embedded Linux and Microsoft Windows
CE 5.0, each containing the requisite documentation and tools for
immediate deployment.
