Protect your laptop files with FUSE and an on-line storage service.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x280a580.0x2902240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Information on a filesystem can be encrypted to protect against
unintended disclosure when a laptop is stolen; however, doing so doesn't allow you to access
the files you've been working on if someone steals your laptop.
If you have been traveling for a few weeks, making modifications to
source code or office documents with your laptop, and it is lost or stolen,
you still need to be able to access those updated files when you
return home. On the other hand, if your laptop isn't stolen, you
probably would like the peace of mind knowing the hard disk in the
laptop is not the single point of failure for your important changes.
</p><p>
This article describes how to set up a system allowing backups to one
or more on-line storage providers. You can choose either a free on-line
storage provider or a paid service, depending on the consequences of
losing your data or not having guaranteed immediate access to your
backups.
</p><p>
You might find that many Internet connections made available to you
when traveling have a very &ldquo;protective&rdquo; packet filtering
system. For
example, some hotels will filter all traffic that is not HTTP or
HTTPS. Many on-line storage systems are made accessible over HTTP using
the same HTTP operations performed by Web browsers. So,
you still can upload your changes even when using very
restrictive Internet connections. In this situation, other solutions, such as direct
use of rsync over SSH, most likely will be filtered out.
</p><p>
One of the combinations described here should work with the most
restrictive Internet connections. Two applications of on-line backups
come to mind. If you are working on some documents or a smallish code
tree, using Omnidrive for storage is a good free backup solution. If you
have a nice digital camera and an on-line storage space that is larger, 
you can back up digital pictures incrementally as
you travel. So, if the external 80GB drive to which you transfer
your digital pictures goes missing, you won't lose your memories.
The latter requires a reasonably fast (and free-of-charge)
Internet connection at your hotel and that you leave the laptop on to upload
overnight.
</p><p>
The key to making access to storage easy is using FUSE to mount
the on-line storage service. Using FUSE makes all storage services look the
same (or similar, to be more accurate) to the higher-level encryption and
synchronization software. However, some FUSE filesystems for mounting
on-line storage offer slightly different implementations, which might
require some working around at higher
levels.
</p><p>
Because you are backing up important data to a server you don't
control or perhaps fully trust, the next layer should provide security
to your precious data. The eCryptfs filesystem was described in the
April 2007 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>. EncFS is a FUSE filesystem offering
filesystem encryption. Both eCryptfs and EncFS take an existing
filesystem (the base) and offer a new filesystem (the encrypted
filesystem). Any data that is written to the encrypted
filesystem is encrypted transparently and stored onto the base
filesystem. Reading data will decrypt the information 
transparently from the base filesystem.
</p><p>
So, you can have storage mounted as FUSE (call this ~/rawfs) and then
remounted with EncFS (at another mountpoint, ~/backupfs). Files
copied to ~/backupfs are encrypted and saved to ~/rawfs, which then
saves them to the on-line storage (Omnidrive, GMailfs, sshfs, Openomy,
Amazon S3&mdash;whichever you mount using FUSE at ~/rawfs).
</p><p>
The simplest way to keep your backup fresh is to use rsync(1) from your
local data (perhaps in ~/documents) to your encrypted on-line
filesystem.
</p><p>
Testing for this article was performed on a Fedora 7 machine. Some of the commands
shown here, such as package installation commands, may be specific to the Fedora
distribution.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x280a580.0x2902818"></a>
Mounting Web Storage</h2></div></div><p>
Depending on your Linux distribution, you may need to add your user to
the fuse group to be able to mount FUSE filesystems as a nonroot
user. On Fedora 7, you would run the following command 
to enable the user ben to mount FUSE
filesystems:

<pre     class="programlisting">
usermod -a -G fuse ben
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, let's examine some different on-line storage providers
and how to mount them with FUSE.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x280a580.0x29029d0"></a>
OmniFS</h2></div></div><p>
OmniFS allows you to mount the Omnidrive storage provider as a FUSE
filesystem. Installation and use of OmniFS goes like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar xjvf omnifs-0.3.0.tar.bz2
$ cd ./omnifs-0.3.0
$ ln -s /usr/include/fuse /usr/local/include/fuse
$ ./configure
$ make

$ su -l
# make install
# ldconfig

# cp sample.cfg ~ben/my-omnifs.cfg
# chown ben.ben ~ben/my-omnifs.cfg
# exit

$ id -u -n
ben
$ cd ~
$ edit my-omnifs.cfg
...
change login, password, api-key and api-private-key
set
omnifs-log-file = /home/ben/omnifs.log

either comment out the proxy setting
or set proxy settings to be valid

...
$ mkdir ~/rawfs
$ omnifs -c my-omnifs.cfg ~/rawfs
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x280a580.0x2902b30"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Building omnifs fails to find FUSE during
configure unless I create the link in /usr/local.
</p><p>
To configure the FUSE filesystem, first log in to Omnidrive's Web
interface (<a href="http://web.omnidrive.com" target="_self">web.omnidrive.com</a>), and note the API and
API-private keys for use in the configuration file. After logging in,
the keys are available by clicking the Settings button in the top
right of the browser and then the API tab in the center of screen.
</p><p>
By default, the omnifs command runs in the foreground, so it blocks
the terminal as long as the FUSE mountpoint is valid. After running
the omnifs executable to mount the FUSE filesystem, the remote
storage appears just like any filesystem:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd ~/rawfs
$ date &gt;| foo.txt
$ cat foo.txt
Thu Aug 23 17:50:23 EDT 2007
$ ls -l
total 0
drwx------ 0 ben ben  0 2007-08-31 03:15 Downloads
-rwx------ 0 ben ben 29 2007-08-31 08:50 foo.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
I found that omnifs occasionally can hang at &ldquo;DEBUG: OMNI_ReadDir
Called&rdquo; in its log file. Restarting the omnifs executable usually
helps get things going again.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x280a580.0x2902e48"></a>
SSH FUSE Filesystem</h2></div></div><p>
Using SSH as the underlying transport for the FUSE filesystem
limits usage to Internet connections that do not filter out non-Web
traffic. 
</p><p>
Given that you can use SSH directly with rsync, you might be wondering
why bother with FUSE at all. Using SSH protects the transport of your
information to the SSH server. Note that once the files you rsync to
the server have been sent, they are not encrypted on the server's
filesystem. If you don't have complete faith in the security of the
SSH server, using sshfs to provide FUSE access lets you use
the same cryptography discussed in the next section to protect your backups on the
SSH server. Also, having all of your on-line storage accessible through
FUSE lets you quickly change where you are storing an on-line backup
without affecting the rest of the system.
</p><p>
In Fedora, sshfs already is packaged and can be installed with yum.
Installation from source follows the standard configure path:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# yum install fuse-sshfs
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x280a580.0x29030b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Or:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ ./configure &amp;&amp; make;
$ su -l
# make install

</pre>
</p><p>
Assuming you are using public keys on the server into which you are
ssh-ing,
starting to use sshfs is easy. As shown in Listing 1, I first add
the server's key to my SSH agent before ssh-ing into the server and
creating a directory to use for my on-line storage. I exit the
connection and mount the SSH server to ~/rawfs and touch a file in a
predictable way. The last command is ssh-ing into the server again to
verify that the date has been added to a file in the on-line storage
directory.
</p><p>
The mounting of sshfs can be tucked away into a script file, as shown
in Listing 2. This can be convenient if you do not have a
passphrase on the SSH key or if you do not always add (or want to add) that SSH
key to your SSH agent.

Security</h2></div></div><p>
If you are running a 2.6.20 kernel or later, eCryptfs should be
ready for use without any setup work. Running a 2.6.22 Fedora 7
updated kernel, I had major problems getting eCryptfs to work properly
where the base filesystem was stored on a FUSE filesystem. When I did
get eCryptfs to mount, there were errors with trying to use rsync to the
eCryptfs filesystem, which finally resulted in a kernel oops. I have
eCryptfs working fine using a local ext3 filesystem to store its
encrypted data, so I suspect it is an issue with eCryptfs and FUSE
interaction. Depending on which distribution you are running, setting
up eCryptfs to allow nonroot users to mount an encrypted filesystem
also can require some tinkering with PAM.
</p><p>
EncFS is a FUSE filesystem that takes a &ldquo;raw&rdquo; filesystem and presents
a new filesystem. Any files created on the new filesystem will be
encrypted and stored to the raw filesystem. EncFS requires FUSE,
OpenSSL and rlog. The FUSE EncFS filesystem can be installed either
from your distribution's package repository or manually, like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
yum install fuse-encfs
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x280a580.0x29038f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Or:

<pre     class="programlisting">

tar xzvf rlog-1.3.7.tgz
cd rlog-1.3.7
./configure &amp;&amp; make
make install
cd ..
tar xzvf encfs-1.3.2-1.tgz
cd encfs-1.3.2
./configure &amp;&amp; make
make install

</pre>
</p><p>
The first time you attempt to mount a raw filesystem to an encrypted
filesystem, EncFS will ask you what level of cryptography you desire
and what passphrase to use. The same command is used to create an
encrypted filesystem and to mount one. Subsequent mounts of the raw
filesystem with EncFS will prompt you only for the passphrase. Initial
mounting and remounting of EncFS on a rawfs (backed at the time by sshfs) is
shown here:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ encfs ~/rawfs ~/backupfs
Creating new encrypted volume.
Please choose from one of the following options:
 enter "x" for expert configuration mode,

Performing the Backup: Synchronization</h2></div></div><p>
We now have a ~/backupfs filesystem that encrypts anything written to
it and stores it on an on-line storage system somewhere. A great tool
for keeping your on-line backup up to date is rsync(1). 
</p><p>
The rsync manual page states:
&ldquo;The rsync remote-update protocol allows rsync to transfer just the 
differences between two sets of files across the network
connection.&rdquo;
</p><p>
In our case, both the data to be backed up and the place to which we are backing
up appear through the Linux kernel. Because ~/backupfs needs
to read and write to the Internet, we very much would like to limit the
amount of data that is written to it.
</p><p>
Some differences between a normal Linux kernel filesystem like ext3
and our layered setup might have to be worked around with command-line
options to rsync. Listing 3 shows an rsync on an EncFS,
which is using sshfs to provide the on-line storage. The first
time rsync is run, the whole file is uploaded to the on-line
storage. The second time, only some metadata is sent and received.
</p><p>
The -a option to rsync is similar to the -a option to the cp command;
it attempts to preserve everything in the source filesystem at the
destination. The --no-g command-line option to rsync tells it not to
try to sync the destination file's group to the source file's
group. In this case, the sshfs does not allow me to change the group of
the destination file, so rsync would generate a warning when it failed
to set the remote file's group. The --delete-after cleans up any files
that exist only in the on-line storage filesystem. In this case, I also
use --include to sync only the plain-text files. This can be quite
handy for keeping backups of only OpenOffice.org documents in a larger
filesystem.

</pre></div><p>
Another rsync option that can be invaluable is --modify-window=n,
where the parameter n is the number of seconds that the two timestamps
can differ between the local and remote files and still be considered
the same. When using a filesystem showing on-line storage, the
modification time might range from not being perfectly accurate to
being a few days off. Setting the --modify-window correctly can hide
these slight timestamp drifts or large fixed timestamp offsets and
allow rsync to continue to work efficiently.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Running EncFS on top of OmniFS requires some special parameters when
first mounting the EncFS. The main issue I found with using the
default settings for EncFS was that file contents, when read back, would
sometimes have trailing garbage. When using OmniFS and first creating
the EncFS, choose expert mode, cipher=AES, keysize=256, blocksize=4096,
filename encoding=Stream, filename IV chaining=Yes, per-file IV=no and
block authentication code headers=no. The main issues seem to stem
from the per file IV settings and something going missing with the
round-trip latency of OmniFS. Listing 4
shows some combinations of expert mode settings to EncFS when using OmniFS
as the base filesystem and the resulting filesystem interaction.

</pre></div><p>
Some filesystem people dislike FUSE because of the extra
context switches it can introduce. The use of two FUSE filesystems
layered on top of each other, as shown in this article, means there is quite a
bit of context switching going on in order actually to get data to the
network. For the purposes of this article, the overhead of these
context switches is irrelevant when compared to Internet connection
speed.
</p><p>
Encrypting your home directory can give peace of mind in the event
that your laptop is stolen. With on-line backups, you also are protected
against losing your important changes along with your laptop or its
crashing hard disk.
</p><p>
By using FUSE to expose the on-line storage as a filesystem, the
encryption and synchronization can be left intact when you decide to
change your on-line storage provider. The OmniFS filesystem uses HTTP
to communicate with the on-line storage provider, so it should work even
when your Internet connection has aggressive packet filtering.
