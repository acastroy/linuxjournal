Stored procedures bring the legacy advantages and challenges to MySQL.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a7a580.0x1b72348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Stored procedures (or stored routines, to use the official
MySQL terminology) are programs that are both stored and executed within
the database server. Stored procedures have been features in closed-source relational databases, such as Oracle, since the early 1990s.
However,
MySQL added stored procedure support only in the recent 5.0 release and,
consequently, applications built on the LAMP stack don't generally
incorporate stored procedures. So, this is an opportune time to consider
whether stored procedures should be incorporated into your MySQL
applications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a7a580.0x1b72500"></a>
Stored Procedures in the Client-Server Era</h2></div></div><p>
Database stored programs first came to prominence in the late 1980s and
early 1990s, during the client-server revolution. In the client-server
applications of that time, stored programs had some obvious advantages:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Client-server applications typically had to balance
processing load carefully between the client PC and the (relatively) more powerful
server machine. Using stored programs was one way to reduce the load on
the client, which might otherwise be overloaded.
</p></li><li><p>
Network bandwidth was often a serious constraint on client-server
applications; execution of multiple server-side operations in a single
stored program could reduce network traffic.
</p></li><li><p>
Maintaining correct versions of client software in a client-server
environment was often problematic. Centralizing at least some of the
processing on the server allowed a greater measure of control over core
logic.
</p></li><li><p>
Stored programs offered clear security advantages because, in those
days, application users typically connected directly to the database,
rather than through a middle tier. As I discuss later in this article, stored
procedures allow you to restrict the database account only to 
well-defined procedure calls, rather than allowing the account to
execute any and all SQL statements.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
With the emergence of three-tier architectures and Web applications,
some of the incentives to use stored programs from within applications
disappeared. Application clients are now often browser-based, security
is predominantly handled by a middle tier, and the middle tier possesses
the ability to encapsulate business logic. Most of the functions for
which stored programs were used in client-server applications now can be
implemented in middle-tier code (PHP, Java, C# and so on).
</p><p>
Nevertheless, many of the traditional advantages of stored procedures
remain, so let's consider these advantages, and some disadvantages, in
more depth.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a7a580.0x1b729d0"></a>
Using Stored Procedures to Enhance Database Security</h2></div></div><p>
Stored procedures are subject to most of the security restrictions that
apply to other database objects: tables, indexes, views and so forth. Specific
permissions are required before a user can create a stored program, and,
similarly, specific permissions are needed in order to execute a
program.
</p><p>
What sets the stored program security model apart from that of other
database objects&mdash;and from other programming languages&mdash;is that stored
programs may execute with the permissions of the user who
<span   class="emphasis"><em>created</em></span>
the stored procedure, rather than those of the user who is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>executing</em></span> the stored procedure. This model allows
users to
perform actions via a stored procedure that they would not be authorized
to perform using normal SQL.
</p><p>
This facility, sometimes called definer rights 
security, allows us to tighten our database security, because we can ensure
that a user gains access to tables only via stored program code that
restricts the types of operations that can be performed on those tables
and that can implement various business and data integrity rules. For
instance, by establishing a stored program as the only mechanism
available for certain table inserts or updates, we can ensure that all
of these operations are logged, and we can prevent any invalid data
entry from making its way into the table.
</p><p>
In the event that this application account is compromised (for instance,
if the password is cracked), attackers still will be able to
execute only our stored programs, as opposed to being able to run any ad hoc
SQL. Although such a situation constitutes a severe security breach, at
least we are assured that attackers will be subject to the same checks
and logging as normal application users. They also will be denied the
opportunity to retrieve information about the underlying database schema
(because the ability to run standard SQL will be granted to the procedure,
not the user), which will hinder attempts to perform further malicious
activities.
</p><p>
Another security advantage inherent in stored programs is their
resistance to SQL injection attacks. An SQL injection attack can occur
when a malicious user manages to &ldquo;inject&rdquo; SQL code into the SQL code
being constructed by the application. Stored programs do not offer the
only protection against SQL injection attacks, but applications that
rely exclusively on stored programs to interact with the database are
largely resistant to this type of attack (provided that those stored
programs do not themselves build dynamic SQL strings without fully
validating their inputs).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a7a580.0x1b72d40"></a>
Data Abstraction</h2></div></div><p>
It is generally a good practice to separate your data access code from
your business logic and presentation logic. Data access routines 
often are used by multiple program modules and are likely to be maintained by a
separate group of developers. A very common scenario requires changes to
the underlying data structures while minimizing the impact on
higher-level logic. Data abstraction makes this much easier to
accomplish.
</p><p>
The use of stored programs provides a convenient way of implementing a
data access layer. By creating a set of stored programs that implement
all of the data access routines required by the application, we are
effectively building an API for the application to use for all database
interactions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a7a580.0x1b72ea0"></a>
Reducing Network Traffic</h2></div></div><p>
Stored programs can improve application performance radically by
reducing network traffic in certain situations.
</p><p>
It's commonplace for an application to accept input from an end user,
read some data in the database, decide what statement to execute next,
retrieve a result, make a decision, execute some SQL and so on. If the
application code is written entirely outside the database, each of
these steps would require a network round trip between the database and
the application. The time taken to perform these network trips 
easily can dominate overall user response time.
</p><p>
Consider a typical interaction between a bank customer and an ATM
machine. The user requests a transfer of funds between two accounts. The
application must retrieve the balance of each account from the database,
check withdrawal limits and possibly other policy information, issue
the relevant UPDATE statements, and finally issue a commit, all before
advising the customer that the transaction has succeeded. Even for this
relatively simple interaction, at least six separate database queries
must be issued, each with its own network round trip between the
application server and the database. Figure 1 shows the sequences
of interactions that would be required without a stored program.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9652f1.large.jpg"><img src="9652f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Network Round Trips without Stored Procedure
</p></div></div><p>
On the other hand, if a stored program is used to implement the fund
transfer logic, only a single database interaction is required. The
stored program takes responsibility for checking balances, withdrawal
limits and so on. Figure 2 shows the reduction in network round
trips that occurs as a result.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9652f2.large.jpg"><img src="9652f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Network Round Trips with Stored Procedure 
</p></div></div><p>
Network round trips also can become significant when an application is
required to perform some kind of aggregate processing on very large
record sets in the database. For instance, if the application needs to
retrieve millions of rows in order to calculate some sort of business
metric that cannot be computed easily using native SQL, such as average
time to complete an order, a very large number of round trips can
result. In such a case, the network delay again may become the dominant
factor in application response time. Performing the calculations in a
stored program will reduce network overhead, which might reduce overall
response time, but you need to be sure to take into account the
differences in raw computation speed, which I discuss later in this
article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a7a580.0x1b73478"></a>
Creating Common Routines across Multiple Applications</h2></div></div><p>
Although it is commonplace for a MySQL database to be at the service of a
single application, it is not at all uncommon for multiple applications
to share a single database. These applications might run on different
machines and be written in different languages; it may be hard, or
impossible, for these applications to share code. Implementing common
code in stored programs may allow these applications to share critical
common routines.
</p><p>
For instance, in a banking application, transfer of funds transactions
might originate from multiple sources, including a bank teller's
console, an Internet browser, an ATM or a phone banking application.
Each of these applications could conceivably have its own database
access code written in largely incompatible languages, and without
stored programs we might have to replicate the transaction logic,
including logging, deadlock handling and optimistic locking strategies,
in multiple places and in multiple languages. In this scenario,
consolidating the logic in a database stored procedure can make a lot of
sense.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a7a580.0x1b735d8"></a>
Not Built for Speed?</h2></div></div><p>
It would be terribly unfair of us to expect the first release of the
MySQL stored program language to be blisteringly fast. After all,
languages such as Perl and PHP have been the subject of tweaking and
optimization for about a decade, while the latest generation of
programming languages&mdash;.NET and Java&mdash;has been the subject of a
shorter, but more intensive optimization process by some of the biggest
software companies in the world. So, right from the start, we might
expect that the MySQL stored program language would lag in comparison
with the other languages commonly used in the MySQL world.
</p><p>
Still, it's important to get a sense of the raw performance of the
language. First, let's see how quickly the stored program language
can crunch numbers. The first example compares a stored procedure
calculating prime numbers against an identical algorithm implemented in
alternative languages.
</p><p>
In this computationally intensive trial, MySQL performed poorly compared
with other languages&mdash;five times slower than PHP or Perl, and dozens of
times slower than Java, .NET or C (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9652f3.large.jpg"><img src="9652f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Stored procedures are a poor choice for number crunching.
</p></div></div><p>
Most of the time, stored programs are dominated by database access time,
where stored programs have a natural performance advantage over other
programming languages because of their lower network overhead. However,
if you are writing a number-crunching routine, and you have a choice
between implementing it in the stored program language or in another
language, such as PHP or Java, you may wisely decide against using the
stored program solution.
</p><p>
If the previous example left you feeling less than enthusiastic about
stored program performance, this next example should cheer you right up.
Although stored programs aren't particularly zippy when it comes to
number crunching, it is definitely true that you don't normally write
stored programs simply to perform math; stored programs almost always
process data from the database. In these circumstances, the difference
between stored program and PHP or Java performance is usually minimal,
unless network overhead is a big factor. When a program is required to
process large numbers of rows from the database, a stored program can
substantially outperform programs written in client languages, because it
does not have to wait for rows to be transferred across the
network&mdash;the stored program runs <span   class="emphasis"><em>inside</em></span> the
database. Figure 4
shows how a stored procedure that aggregates millions of rows can
perform well even when called from a remote host across the network,
while a Java program with identical logic suffers from severe
network-driven response time degradation.

factor.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a7a580.0x1b73c08"></a>
Logic Fragmentation</h2></div></div><p>
Although it is generally useful to encapsulate data access logic inside
stored programs, it is usually inadvisable to &ldquo;fragment&rdquo; business and
application logic by implementing some of it in stored programs and the
rest of it in the middle tier or the application client.
</p><p>
Debugging application errors that involve interactions between stored
program code and other application code may be many times more difficult
than debugging code that is completely encapsulated in the application
layer. For instance, there is currently no debugger that can trace
program flow from the application code into the MySQL stored program
code.
</p><p>
Also, if your application relies on stored procedures, that's an
additional skill that you or your team will have to acquire and
maintain.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a7a580.0x1f6c068"></a>
Object-Relational Mapping</h2></div></div><p>
It's becoming increasingly common for an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
framework to mediate interactions between the application and the
database. ORM is very common in Java (Hibernate and EJB), almost
unavoidable in Ruby on Rails (ActiveRecord) and far less common in PHP
(though there are an increasing number of PHP ORM packages available).
ORM systems generate SQL to maintain a mapping between program objects
and database tables. Although most ORM systems allow you to overwrite the
ORM SQL with your own code, such as a stored procedure call, doing so
negates some of the advantages of the ORM system. In short, stored
procedures become harder to use and a lot less attractive when used in
combination with ORM.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a7a580.0x1f6c170"></a>
Are Stored Procedures Portable?</h2></div></div><p>
Although all relational databases implement a common set of SQL syntax,
each RDBMS offers proprietary extensions to this standard SQL, and MySQL
is no exception. If you are attempting to write an application that is
designed to be independent of the underlying database, you probably
will want to avoid these extensions in your application. However, sometimes
you'll need to use specific syntax to get the most out of the server.
For instance, in MySQL, you often will want to employ MySQL hints,
execute non-ANSI statements, such as LOCK TABLES, or use the REPLACE
statement.
</p><p>
Using stored programs can help you avoid RDBMS-dependent code in your
application layer while allowing you to continue to take advantage of
RDBMS-specific optimizations. In theory, stored program calls against
different databases can be made to look and behave identically from the
application's perspective. You can encapsulate all the
database-dependent code inside the stored procedures. Of course, the
underlying stored program code will need to be rewritten for each RDBMS,
but at least your application code will be relatively portable.
</p><p>
However, there are differences between the various database servers in
how they handle stored procedure calls, especially if those calls return
result sets. MySQL, SQL Server and DB2 stored procedures behave very
similarly from the application's point of view. However, Oracle and
Postgres calls can look and act differently, especially if your stored
procedure call returns one or more result sets.
</p><p>
So, although using stored procedures can improve the portability of your
application while still allowing you to exploit vendor-specific syntax,
they don't make your application totally portable.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a7a580.0x1f6c380"></a>
Other Considerations</h2></div></div><p>
MySQL stored programs can be used for a variety of tasks in addition to
traditional application logic:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Triggers are stored programs that fire when data modification
language (DML) statements execute. Triggers can automate denormalization
and enforce business rules without requiring application code changes
and will take effect for all applications that access the database,
including ad hoc SQL.
</p></li><li><p>
The MySQL event scheduler introduced in the 5.1 release allows stored
procedure code to be executed at regular intervals. This is handy for
running regular application maintenance tasks, such as purging and
archiving.
</p></li><li><p>
The MySQL stored program language can be used to create functions
that can be called from standard SQL. This allows you to encapsulate
complex application calculations in a function and then use that
function within SQL calls. This can centralize logic, improve
maintainability and, if used carefully, improve performance.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a7a580.0x1f6c6f0"></a>
You Decide!</h2></div></div><p>
The bottom line is that MySQL stored procedures give you more options
for implementing your application and, therefore, are undeniably a
&ldquo;good thing&rdquo;. Judicious use of stored procedures can result in a more
secure, higher performing and maintainable application. However, the degree to
which an application might benefit from stored procedures is greatly
dependent on the nature of that application. I hope this article helps
you make a decision that works for your situation.
