A wide variety of vendors&mdash;now including Dell and Lenovo&mdash;sell preloaded
Linux laptops. This buying guide should help you find the right laptop for
your needs and budget.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x128a580.0x1382298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Although installing Linux on desktop PCs with standard hardware has become
a snap, the same cannot be said as confidently for laptops. Getting all
of a laptop's functionality to work on your own generally requires an
investment of time and effort, which may not yield dividends in the end.
If you need a Linux laptop that lets you open the box and get to work,
we recommend the purchase of a preloaded machine from one of the many
excellent vendors in today's marketplace.
</p><p>
When you begin your search for the perfect preloaded Linux laptop,
you'll quickly learn the hard truth that we in the faithful Linux nation
have fewer cutting-edge laptops than our Windows-running counterparts.
Nevertheless, there is much to celebrate as life gradually becomes more
fair for us. Innovation and new options are plentiful among both our
old standby Linux hardware vendors and new, larger providers, such as
Lenovo and Dell. Although we Linuxers most likely can't make every laptop out there
run Linux, we have a wide selection from every category, with more
variety arriving every day.
</p><p>
In addition to commending the ongoing efforts of the Linux hardware
specialists, we warmly welcome Dell and Lenovo to the club of Linux
laptop providers, happy the big vendors finally see the light.
Unfortunately, both companies have started small and conservatively at
one laptop apiece, each with fewer features than the exact same model
with Windows Vista preloaded. Regardless, we wish these firms success
and encourage them to let buyers purchase every PC they sell with
Linux preloaded. We also hope this new competition will spur 
longtime Linux vendors to push themselves to offer even more variety and
options at lower prices.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x128a580.0x1382558"></a>
What's Out There?</h2></div></div><p>
If you venture into the vast on-line PC marketplace, you'll find nearly
a dozen US and Canadian firms (many more elsewhere, of course) peddling a
wide range of laptop computers with Linux preloaded. Most of these firms are
Linux specialists that load Linux onto and configure a third-party machine.
In these firms' on-line stores, you'll have absolutely no problem finding
a great selection of powerful, practical, business-oriented laptops with a
14.1", 15.4" or 17" display, a robust Core 2 Duo processor, buckets of RAM
and a mammoth hard drive that cost less than $2,000. Almost without
exception, you can configure your laptop as either a Linux-only or a
dual-boot machine, with some vendors offering only Windows XP and others
offering a choice between Windows XP or Vista. Unfortunately, the generalists,
Lenovo and Dell, have decided to forgo the dual-boot option for now,
which we predict will reduce their sales&mdash;we Linux folks demand a high degree of choice
and control.
</p><p>
Specialty machines are harder to find in the Linux space,
as are functioning specialty features on many of the available
machines. Regarding specialty machines running Linux, if you
want a screaming gaming machine, a media center or an ultraportable, your
options are much more limited. In addition, when you're buying one of the
available Linux machines, be a wary buyer because oftentimes a laptop
will ship with, for example, a built-in Webcam, fingerprint scanner,
cellular broadband capability or 802.11n Wi-Fi, but the vendor hasn't
gotten it to work yet under Linux.
</p><p>
Despite the above complaints, you can find a limited number of interesting
specialty laptops if you know where to look. One company to watch is
Taiwan's ASUS, manufacturer of the most common laptops onto which the
Linux specialists (such as R Cubed, LinuxCertified and HPC Systems) choose
to preload Linux. The must-have device at the close of 2007 is the new
ASUS Eee PC, a brand-new two-pound ultraportable with a 7" display that will
sell for $259 and up. See below for more details.
</p><p>
If you have a quirky laptop need, perhaps the best place to look is at
EmperorLinux, a company specializing in Linux-based laptops from a number
of manufacturers, including Dell, Lenovo, Panasonic and Sony. Not only
does
EmperorLinux attempt to cover nearly every niche, including ultraportable, rugged,
tablet and desktop replacements, but it also does the best job of making
advanced features, such as GPS, cellular broadband, tablets and 802.11n Wi-Fi,
work out of the box. See below for reviews of two laptops from
EmperorLinux.
</p><p>
It also is heartening to know we have more options for protecting
the environment when choosing a Linux laptop, as many of them are
Energy Star-compliant. This means the device meets or exceeds
criteria from the Environmental Protection Agency for energy consumption.
Among other things, Energy Star-compliant notebooks must consume no more
than 1W of power when off, 1.7W when hibernating and 22W when idle.
</p><p>
So that's the big picture; now, let's find a laptop that meets
your needs. To give you a sense of what preloaded Linux laptops
are available, we've created this laptop buyer's guide. We asked all the
vendors we could find to send us their two most compelling machines for
review. Although not every company took part, the ones below did. This guide
is not intended to be exhaustive but rather a taste test of some 
currently available preloaded Linux laptops.
</p><p>
Below are mini reviews of seven different preloaded Linux laptops
(eight if you include the ASUS Z84J sent by two different vendors) that you can
buy today. The primary emphasis of these reviews is on the overall Linux
experience and functionality, which surprisingly varies greatly among
vendors. The secondary emphasis is on the feature sets. 
All machines, unless otherwise noted, came with integrated 802.11a/b/g Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, which are standard features nowadays.

EmperorLinux Rhino D830 (Dell Latitude D830)&mdash;Power and Graphics in a
Portable Package</h2></div></div><p>
The Rhino D830, the Linux edition
of the Dell Latitude D830, is a desktop replacement machine for those
who want a mid-sized presence (15.4" WUXGA display at 1920x1200) with
a blend of solid features and excellent performance at a decent price.
Weighing in at just more than seven pounds, the Rhino D830 may become annoyingly
heavy in transit. Nevertheless, the machine has a sturdy, sleek and
durable magnesium alloy frame, responsive keyboard and long-lasting
9-cell battery.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9908f1.large.jpg"><img src="9908f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
EmperorLinux Rhino D830
</p></div></div><p>
Our test Rhino D830 came with a 2.2GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 2GB
of RAM, 160GB hard drive (7,200rpm), DVD+/-RW drive (Blu-ray optional),
the NVIDIA Quadro NVS 140M1 video card with 256MB of video RAM and
accelerated OpenGL for workstation-level graphics applications, such as
video editing and 3-D modeling. You can order the Rhino D830 with up to 8GB
of RAM.
</p><p>
In our experience, EmperorLinux is hands-down the most fanatical vendor regarding
attention to detail and making sure every feature works well under
Linux.
EmperorLinux also provides the most complete documentation. The Rhino D830
we tested ran 64-bit Fedora 7 with EmperorLinux's own custom kernel,
as well as Windows XP Home. As expected, nearly everything worked
as promised, including the Fn keys and fingerprint scanner. Furthermore,
EmperorLinux has ensured that the optional Verizon EV-DO cellular data modem
works, although it must be activated one time under Windows. This is the
only laptop we tested with this functionality working. Finally,
EmperorLinux
says it is vigilantly improving the 802.11n Wi-Fi on this machine as it
begins to ship the IPW4965 wireless Ethernet cards and the state of the
driver improves.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Pros:</b></span>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The best documentation in the business.
</p></li><li><p>
Decent built-in speakers.

Lenovo IBM ThinkPad T61&mdash;Ergonomic Business Machine</h2></div></div><p>
Although you already can purchase the Lenovo IBM
ThinkPad T61 from EmperorLinux under its Toucan line, it's refreshing
to see Lenovo developing preloaded Linux laptops as well. For this article,
we were able to acquire a preview machine that should be available
to the general public before Christmas 2007. To its credit, Lenovo has
retained the original ThinkPad ergonomic quality in the T61. We liked
the intelligent keyboard layout, the keyboard response and the presence
of both a pointing stick and touchpad for navigating this machine.
Furthermore, although we don't much appreciate that the battery juts
out the back and that the casing is the same old plastic (and not a lighter
alloy), the classic ThinkPad aura is easy to like. At 5.2 pounds, this
machine would work for a road warrior seeking portable power.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9908f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Lenovo IBM ThinkPad T61
</p></div></div><p>
Our review ThinkPad T61 ran SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop (SLED)
and had a 14.1" WXGA+ (at 1440x900) display, an Intel Centrino Core 2
Duo T7700 at 2.40GHz, 2GB of RAM, 160GB hard drive, DVD+/-RW drive
and an NVIDIA Quadro NVS 140M video card with 128MB of video RAM.
</p><p>
We caught Lenovo in product-development mode
when reviewing the T61, which was evident in the hobbled state of its
Linux-based functionality. Therefore, it is unfair to complain about the
many things that aren't working just yet. My contact at Lenovo, despite
his Tony Snow-worthy evasions, has assured me that its engineers are
working quickly and furiously to provide full support for SUSE Linux
Enterprise Desktop. Some issues in development include full support
for the NVIDIA video card (for 3-D acceleration and Xgl/Compiz) and
power management (suspend to disk and suspend to RAM). The machine
we received had a fingerprint reader, which unfortunately will not be
present on the Linux-based production machine.
</p><p>
Politics aside for a moment, it was a smart choice aesthetically and
functionally for Lenovo to go with SLED. Not only is SLED an excellent,
well-planned distribution with an attractive menu system and the sexy
Xgl graphical environment, it offers useful applications, such as Novell
AppArmor. At the time of this writing, Lenovo was unsure whether it will offer
dual-boot or Linux-only machines.
</p><p>
Although we cannot yet fully judge whether Lenovo has scored a touchdown
with the ThinkPad T61, it is clear that the company is trying hard,
in cooperation with Novell/SUSE, to offer a top-quality Linux laptop
with a competitive (and functional) feature set. We encourage Lenovo
to continue its efforts over the long term and not just give Linux a
halfhearted try, only to prophesy Linux's lack of viability.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Pros:</b></span>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The most ergonomically pleasing machine of those tested.
</p></li><li><p>
Useful reading light.
</p></li><li><p>
Has both pointing stick and touchpad.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Cons:</b></span>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>

EmperorLinux Wasp CF-19 (Panasonic Toughbook CF-19)&mdash;Battle-Ready
Rugged Notebook</h2></div></div><p>
Because your company likely will be 
ponying up the $4,250 for this notebook, you should read on. The Wasp
CF-19 is EmperorLinux's Linux-based iteration of the Panasonic Toughbook
CF-19. Indeed, this tough cookie is no ordinary laptop. Built like an M1
Abrams tank (and used by the US military), the rugged Wasp CF-19 was
a joy to review because we got to see how much thought and effort the
Panasonic engineers put into creatively armoring a computer's exterior.
The Wasp CF-19 is the kind of laptop to accompany you on the construction
site, surveying job, research expedition or field maneuver. It has
been tested independently as MIL-STD-810F (US military standard)
compliant, meaning it can withstand punishment, such as a fall of one
meter, 15,000 feet of altitude and an operating temperature range of
&ndash;20 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Other tests include vibration, dust,
humidity, water resistance, thermal shock and so forth.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9908f3.large.jpg"><img src="9908f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
EmperorLinux Wasp CF-19
</p></div></div><p>
Given its rugged exterior, the Wasp CF-19 is quite light at five pounds with
its magnesium alloy casing. Other features include a shielded yet very
daylight-readable 10.4" XGA display (1024x768), recessed and snugly
capped ports, tablet with handwriting recognition, a tough swivel and
a strong metal clasp that can secure the lid closed or in tablet-up
position. The latchable compartment containing the Wi-Fi on/off switch,
PC card slot, express card slot and SD reader is another smart addition.
</p><p>
Our test machine was configured as follows: Fedora Linux 7 + Windows XP
dual-boot, 1.067GHz Intel Core Duo U2400 ultra-low voltage processor,
1.5GB of RAM, 80GB hard drive and no optical drive (an external USB
DVD/CD-RW costs an extra $400).
</p><p>
As mentioned previously, EmperorLinux appears to be the most fanatical
vendor
as far as offering a rich Linux-based experience, and the Wasp CF-19 lets
EmperorLinux show its stuff. In addition to expected features, such as
working Fn keys, the Wasp CF-19 has a number of features that are atypical for Linux
laptops&mdash;for example, the tablet functionality with screen rotation and
cellular broadband (EV-DO or HSPDA) and GPS support
work out of the box. The custom documentation also is excellent,
explaining what does work (and how) and what does not work, saving the
user precious time and headaches. If only EmperorLinux would add a custom menu
like R Cubed's for custom application installation, system and kernel
updates and direct support options, it'd have the best of all worlds.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Pros:</b></span>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Tablet works flawlessly despite well-protected display; tablet also works
out of the box.
</p></li><li><p>
Custom GNOME application to toggle tablet between landscape and portrait.
</p></li><li><p>
Energy Star-compliant.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Cons:</b></span>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Be sure a machine this small will meet your needs.

R Cubed XW1760 (ASUS Z84J) and LinuxCertified LC2520DC (ASUS
Z84J)&mdash;Low-Frills Desktop Replacements</h2></div></div><p>
Both LinuxCertified and R Cubed
Technologies offer this same ASUS Z84J platform system, a powerful,
handsomely styled, mid-level desktop replacement with some nice multimedia
boosts. Although the S-Video and HDMI outs will come in handy, the four
speakers and subwoofer raised expectations but never rose above tinny
computer audio. With its 17" widescreen display and nearly nine pounds of
gravitational tug, this is a beast that generally stays put. In addition,
although other ASUS machines offer excellent industrial design, less can
be said for the Z84J, which feels a bit more Soviet-era than, say, the
Dell Latitude due to its solid plastic (not metal or carbon-fiber alloy)
construction. The keyboard is comfy enough; however, the touchpad buttons
are sticky, and the body is a little bulky. On such a large spread of
real estate, it also would be nice to have the option to choose between
a pointing stick and touchpad, as Dell and Lenovo offer, but ASUS does
not here. Similarly, it's surprising that the Z84J lacks nice features,
such as indicator lights for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi or a Wi-Fi shutoff switch.
Cellular broadband and 802.11n also are not options for this machine.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9908f4.large.jpg"><img src="9908f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
R Cubed XW1760 (ASUS Z84J)
</p></div></div><p>

<span   class="bold"><b>The Linux Experience from R Cubed</b></span>
</p><p>
Here is the configuration of the R Cubed test machine: Ubuntu Feisty
Fawn, 17" WSXGA+ display, Intel Core 2 Duo T7500 2.2GHz processor, 2GB of
RAM, 60GB 5,400rpm SATA hard drive, a DVD-RW Super-Multi drive
and the NVIDIA G73M 7600 video card with 512MB of video RAM.
</p><p>
If you want to do more with this machine right out of the box, we
recommend the R Cubed experience over LinuxCertified. R Cubed is a
scrappy young company that seeks to offer a range of tools that aid in
package installation and tech support. For instance, in the Applications
menu of the installed Ubuntu Feisty Fawn distribution, R Cubed has its own
custom menu item, which in addition to kernel, patch and system updates,
offers a package installer for applications, such as Google Earth, VMware
Server and multimedia applications with codecs. The system updater works
without breaking any of R Cubed's customizations, and soon distribution
upgrades will be available using this route. There also is a remote
support option, which creates an SSH connection to R Cubed, allowing
technicians to tunnel securely to the machine to gain shell or VNC access
and resolve support issues. Regarding documentation, although R Cubed
has a useful knowledge base on its Web site, nothing comes in the box
beyond the invoice and login information. Although paper may be pass&eacute;,
we strongly feel that good printed materials specific to the machine in
front of you never will go out of style.
</p><p>
Finally, an accurate price from R Cubed was unavailable, as the quoted
price from R Cubed for this configuration did not match the last-minute
check on the on-line configurator, and some minor hardware selections
were unavailable. We regret this lack of information.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Pros:</b></span>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>

R Cubed Technologies provides a nicely customized desktop experience,
including its own menu item for kernel and system updates, package
installation, remote support and more.
</p></div></div><p>

<span   class="bold"><b>The Linux Experience from LinuxCertified</b></span>
</p><p>
Here is the configuration of the LinuxCertified test machine: 17"
WSXGA+ display, Intel Core 2 Duo T7200 2.0GHz processor, 3GB of RAM,
60GB 7,200rpm SATA hard drive, a DVD-RW Super-Multi drive and the
NVIDIA GeForce Go 7700 video card with 512MB of video RAM.
</p><p>
Getting this machine from LinuxCertified means getting a system that's
working but with few added luxuries. Customization generally is up
to you. Some nice surprises include preloaded Google Earth on the
desktop and the myriad preloaded video and audio codecs. On the other
hand, hibernation is not enabled, the Wi-Fi on/off function key doesn't
work, and the Webcam is not supported. Unfortunately, LinuxCertified takes
last prize for documentation&mdash;the on-line information
is sparse, and nothing at all comes in the box.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Pros:</b></span>

R Cubed XW1580 (ASUS S96S)&mdash;Value-Oriented, All-Purpose Laptop</h2></div></div><p>
The R Cubed XW1580 is the Linux edition of the ASUS S96S platform,
preloaded with Ubuntu Feisty Fawn. Sporting a 15.4" WXGA widescreen
display, the overall impression of the XW1580 is cheap chic&mdash;that is, a little
sportier than the very low-end but definitely not Sony-VAIO sexy either.
The XW1580's construction is solid, utilitarian and, at nearly seven pounds,
heavy for its size. However, if you want to get a feature-filled
laptop at a decent price&mdash;and you're not a road warrior&mdash;this may be
your machine.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9908f6.large.jpg"><img src="9908f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
R Cubed XW1580 (ASUS S96S)
</p></div></div><p>
Our test machine came loaded with Ubuntu Feisty Fawn and equipped with
an Intel Core 2 Duo T7300 2.0GHz processor, 2GB of RAM, 80GB 7,200rpm SATA hard drive, DVD-RW drive, and the NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GS with
video card with 256MB of video RAM.
</p><p>
Like R Cubed's other machine reviewed here (the XW1760), you can expect
an above-average, customized Linux experience with the XW1580.
Unfortunately, although nearly all functionality
exists under Linux, some of the same limitations as discussed with the
XW1760 hold here&mdash;no Webcam or modem support under Linux.

HPC Systems V1J-Linux (ASUS V1J)&mdash;Portable Desktop Replacement</h2></div></div><p>
At the time of this writing, HPC Systems, a company
better known for its servers and high-end workstations, was preparing
to market a line of laptops preloaded with Linux. The
V1J-Linux is HPC's first batter to the plate, and we can confidently say
that HPC has gotten on base with a stand-up double. The V1J-Linux, which is a
Linux-loaded ASUS V1J, is a well-built, attractive, full-featured laptop
that will work well for those who put functionality over portability,
though it is not a beast. It has a sleeker, more appealing design and
sufficiently large (in our view) 15.4" WXGA screen when compared with
its larger, bulkier cousin, the ASUS Z84J platform, which is found
elsewhere in this article. One thing that helps this machine over
the ASUS Z84J is its carbon alloy casing, which makes it much lighter
(around six pounds) and visually appealing. This also was the only machine
we tested with a spill-proof keyboard.

</p></div></div><p>
Another bonus feature is the V1J-Linux's RoHS compliance, meaning that
it meets the strict European Union specifications for levels of hazardous
substances, such as lead, cadmium, mercury and others (see Resources
for more information).
</p><p>
Our Ubuntu/Windows Vista Business test machine arrived with an Intel
Core 2 Duo T7200 2.0GHz processor, 1GB of RAM, 120GB hard drive,
a DVD-RW drive and the ATI RADEON X1700 video card with 256MB of video RAM.
</p><p>
Despite the fact that our review machine was preproduction, it is
obvious that HPC Systems has the means and desire to offer a great
Linux experience. Our V1J-Linux came dual-booted with Ubuntu Feisty Fawn
and Windows Vista Business, with nearly every function working well,
including fingerprint scanner, 3-D acceleration, FireWire, Fn keys and so
on.
Unfortunately, however, the built-in Webcam is not working, and we
hope that someone someday will get these ASUS Webcams working once and
for all.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Pros:</b></span>

ASUS Eee PC 700/701&mdash;Long-Awaited Ultra (Ultra)
Portable</h2></div></div><p>
Darn it! At the time of this
writing, ASUS just pushed back the release of its forthcoming Eee
PC from September to October 2007, making a review in time for this issue impossible. The Eee PC
is a new, ultraportable, Linux-based laptop priced at $259 and up.
The lower-end 700 model has 2GB of Flash storage and 256MB of RAM,
and the juiced-up 701 model has 4GB of Flash storage and 512MB
of RAM. Both models feature the following: preloaded Xandros Linux, Intel
Celeron-M 900MHz processor, 7" display, 10/100Mbps LAN, 802.11b/g wireless, three USB 2.0 ports, MMC/SD card reader, VGA out, Windows
XP compatibility/drivers, built-in camera (optional on the 700) and a
4-cell battery with three hours of runtime. There are no optical drives,
and
both models weigh in at two pounds. The word on the &ldquo;blog
street&rdquo;
appears to be that many otherwise Windows users would choose a Linux
device for their mobile needs. ASUS projects that dealers should have
the Eee PC by late October 2007.

Dell Inspiron 1420 N&mdash;Flexible Workhorse Laptop</h2></div></div><p>
Although Dell has embraced Linux by
offering laptops and desktops with Ubuntu preloaded, we suspect that
most of the company is ambivalent at best about selling and supporting
Linux machines. Most of the Linux-specialist companies responded
promptly to our requests for review machines and information; however, a month's
worth of pleading for the same from Dell resulted in no review machine,
creative excuses and receipt of information only after a threat of
negative publicity. Although the people at Dell are extremely friendly
and competent, our impression is that Linux falls far down on their
priority list. Furthermore, Dell's sole (yes, one!) Linux-based laptop
discussed here offers far fewer options than its Windows counterpart.
We fear that Dell will not support Linux with the same kind of passion
that our Linux specialists do, resulting in a self-fulfilling prophesy
along the lines of &ldquo;Look, we tried Linux, but nobody bought it! We told
you there was no market!&rdquo; Unless Dell can weave Linux into its
&ldquo;corporate
DNA&rdquo;, we predict it will fail in this desktop endeavor.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9908f9.large.jpg"><img src="9908f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Dell Inspiron 1420
</p></div></div><p>
Despite those criticisms, it is undeniable that Dell offers its popular
Inspiron 1420 N (the N designates the Linux version) laptop with Linux
preloaded for the same price as its Windows counterpart. More machines
may be on the way, but we received no firm commitment about this. In any case,
although we were unable to get our hands on a review machine, other reviews
have billed the Inspiron 1420 as a workhorse machine that offers a huge
range of options and strikes the right balance between display size
(14.1" widescreen) and portability (six pounds).
</p><p>
Our virtual test configuration included Ubuntu Feisty Fawn, an Intel
Core 2 Duo T5250 1.5GHz processor, 2GB of RAM, a 14.1" widescreen
display at 1280x800, 120GB 5,400rpm SATA hard drive, Intel Graphics
Media Accelerator X3100, CD-RW/DVD player combo drive and, in honor of
John Waters, a &ldquo;Flamingo Pink&rdquo; casing.
</p><p>
Yes, Dell, we Linuxers are grateful that you now sell a preloaded Linux
laptop. Nevertheless, we think you can do better, because you're still
not giving us the Full Monty. Unfortunately, the Linux edition of the
Inspiron 1420 has far fewer options than its Windows Vista cousins.
Here are some differences between the Windows and Linux versions of
the 1420:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The default hard drive with Windows is 120GB, with a maximum
size of 320GB; with Linux, the default is only 80GB and maximum is
160GB. (Insider tip to Dell: Linux users want big storage!)
</p></li><li><p>
On Windows, you can opt for the NVIDIA GeForce 8400M GS or Intel Graphics
Media Accelerator X3100 video cards; on Linux, only the latter is
available.
</p></li><li><p>
Each of the following features is available for Windows but
not Linux: mobile broadband (EV-DO or HSDPA), Webcam, Bluetooth support
and Blu-ray drive.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
What's more, the only Linux-based OS offered is Ubuntu 7.04, with no
dual-boot option available&mdash;a major drawback. Furthermore, our contact
at Dell tells us that all the functionality works fine under Linux,
including the Fn keys, except that the integrated multicard memory
readers won't be supported until a later date. Regarding support,
Dell offers its typical range of warranties on its hardware for up to
four years. As for the software side, Canonical is the entity performing the
support with options ranging from no support up to one year of full OS,
application and networking support.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Support on configured machine:</b></span>
one-year in-home warranty with service, parts and labor. Also includes
24x7 phone support.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Sample configuration:</b></span> $1,049.

Other Companies to Check Out</h2></div></div><p>
We are disappointed that some great companies decided not to send us
evaluation machines and get some free publicity. Despite the snub
(yes, you are forgiven because we know you're busy selling computers),
we encourage you to consider these firms when making your next
Linux laptop purchase.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
CompAmerica:</b></span>
this is a very interesting company that, despite not marketing itself
within the Linux community, is fully committed to Linux. CompAmerica's
CEO, Jack Schulman, is a driven 30+ year industry veteran who has shared
with us his passion for meeting the demanding needs of discriminating
Linux users. Jack told us that CompAmerica offers Linux on every laptop
it sells, including its economy, high-end and &ldquo;super-exotic&rdquo; series.
One example from the latter is the 20" Tiger Shark 9500 with up
to 4GB of RAM, dual NVIDIA Quadro FX Go 2500M GPUs, two hard drives and
two optical drives. The option to choose Linux is not marketed heavily
on the CompAmerica Web site, but at least the option exists.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Polywell Computers:</b></span>
Polywell offers a wide range of preloaded Linux laptops in nearly every
category, such as the 12.1" 4.1-pound PolyNote M212SC ultraportable,
the 13.3" 4.2-pound PolyTablet tablet notebook, and the many business and
specialty laptops with displays from 14" all the way up to 20". In addition,
the five different laptops in the V series all have interchangeable parts
(for example, battery packs, optical drives and hard drives). 
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>ThinkMate:</b></span>
ThinkMate features its a versatile Jetbook line of business-oriented
15.5" and 17" laptops. You can load up your laptop with Fedora 7 or SUSE
10.2 on the Linux side and Windows Vista or XP on the Redmond side&mdash;a
nice touch. All laptops come with a three-year warranty.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Sub300.com/Sub500.com:</b></span>
Although Toronto's Sub300.com/Sub500.com is shy of the press, it has long
been a favorite destination for bargain-hunting hardware aficionados.
This no-frills firm's laptop offering consists of two configurations
of the same ultraportable model: a 3.1-pound device with a 12.1" TFT
display running Linspire (its motto is &ldquo;No Microsoft Mess&rdquo;), and
it maxes out at $1,200. The price is a little steep considering the lack
of built-in optical drive and low-end processors (1GHz Via Centaur or
Intel Pentium M Centrino 1.4GHz). A rugged notebook to compete with
the Panasonic Toughbook also is in the works at the time of this writing.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x128a580.0x190e198"></a>
Let the Good Times Roll</h2></div></div><p>
We hope that this information, although partial, will assist in
planning your next purchase of a preloaded Linux laptop. You should
now have a better idea of what companies sell preloaded Linux laptops,
what key models they sell, and how features, functionality and prices
vary among models. Although we Linux fanatics cannot get every specific
laptop model we want, with some research, most of us can find a machine
that gives us the functionality we demand.
</p><p>
You can find a machine you want due to the plethora of companies that
now offer Linux laptops, and that number is sure to grow and provide
more options from which to choose. Because of this variety, differences exist
among vendors in the devices, features, dual-boot policies, prices, extra
services, warranties and Linux-based functionality they offer.
We cannot recommend strongly enough that you do your homework and keep an open
mind. If you follow this advice, you should find yourself in front of a
Linux laptop that will keep you productive and happy for years to come.
Good luck!
