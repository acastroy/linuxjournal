<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #164, December 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Every once in a while, someone tries to shrink the kernel by removing
support for something old. Typically, a lively debate ensues, and the
end result usually makes sense. This time, the question was does the
kernel really need to support versions of <span   class="bold"><b>GCC</b></span> older than 4.0? The
answer, apparently, was yes. At least for now, <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> feels
that end users could be using a wide variety of compilers, and those
users should be encouraged to compile their own kernels and report on
any bugs they discover. The fewer folks compiling their own kernels,
Linus said, the fewer bug reports come in, and the less the kernel
developers can rely on a global base of testers.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Adrian Bunk</b></span> was the main proponent of ditching the older compilers.
Adrian is one of very few people who put serious time into cleaning up
the kernel sources. He's pointed out that eventually some reduction
in the number of supported compilers will be necessary to reduce code
complexity. The only question then is when would the developers have to
do it. He's also made the case that by supporting all of these different
versions of GCC (and other compilers), any particular bug might be
tightly related to both the kernel version and the compiler version,
in which case, it would be much less likely that the bug would be fixed,
or even verified, by anyone in a position to hunt for it.
</p><p>
Folks like <span   class="bold"><b>Russell King</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Kyle McMartin</b></span> have made the practical
point that GCC 4.0 is still unstable on the <span   class="bold"><b>ARM</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>PARISC</b></span>
architectures. GCC 3.4 also runs faster and generates better code. To
this, Adrian countered that the kernel could still ditch support for
older compilers under architectures other than ARM and PARISC. He
had no counter to the &ldquo;better code&rdquo; argument, but maybe the difference
in code quality would not really be so significant, considering that
most kernel developers use GCC 4.0 anyway.
</p><p>
So, Linus' verdict is in. At least for the moment, older compilers
will continue to compile the kernel. But, for those of you stuck with a
development environment that requires these older compilers, you
probably should start working toward an upgrade before the hammer
falls.
</p><p>
It's always nice to see accessibility
improvements in the kernel, as
it is elsewhere in the world. <span   class="bold"><b>Samuel Thibault</b></span>
recently extended <span   class="bold"><b>Linux
Braille</b></span> support to a ten-dot keyboard, allowing a 1,024 character font.
Up until now, Linux has supported only eight-dot keyboards, with 256
character fonts.
</p><p>
Okay, you've written a new kernel patch, now to whom do you send it? If
you don't know already, finding out could be an arduous process. No
more! <span   class="bold"><b>Joe Perches</b></span> has laboriously gone
through the entire <span   class="bold"><b>MAINTAINERS
file</b></span> and added fields to each feature entry, showing which source
directories that feature affects. He's also written a script to
analyze your patch and tell you exactly where to send it. Presto!
Everyone's life just got easier.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Evgenly Polyakov</b></span> has been working on a
<span   class="bold"><b>distributed storage system</b></span>
(DST) that would allow multiple systems anywhere on a network to act
as a single directory tree. Maintenance and recovery are a big part of
his design, so it should be feasible for users to rely on the
directory hierarchy even when some directory &ldquo;nodes&rdquo; have to be taken
down for maintenance or if their Ethernet cable falls out. There's
been a lot of interest in Evgenly's work, particularly by folks like
<span   class="bold"><b>Daniel Phillips</b></span>. Daniel intends to go through all the code thoroughly
with <span   class="bold"><b>Peter Zijlstra</b></span> to make sure there are no memory deadlocks or
other gotchas. The code still is quite new, so you probably shouldn't
go trusting your data to it quite yet. Once it's ready, it should be
quite impressive though.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Rik van Riel</b></span> has set up a <span   class="bold"><b>Japanese language kernel mailing list</b></span>
targeting kernel newcomers. The URL to join is
<a href="http://lists.kernelnewbies.org/mailman/listinfo/jp-kernelnewbies" target="_self">lists.kernelnewbies.org/mailman/listinfo/jp-kernelnewbies</a>. His
hope is that Japanese developers may find this a more accessible
entryway into kernel development.

Linux aficionados tend to be early adopters, always on the lookout
for the next coolest thing. What better time to bring more gadgets
into the home than during the holidays, when the credit-card balance
is already so high, you'll never notice that extra impulse buy.
Here is a quick look at some gadgets that recently caught our attention.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The countdown is on to November 27, 2007, the day when you can get your
very own Spykee the Spy Robot, a clever little robot that includes a
Webcam and MP3 player. You can control Spykee from any remote location
using the Internet and a local Wi-Fi connection. This vigilant guy can
also be your &ldquo;guard bot&rdquo;. Upon sensing a motion, Spykee
activates an alarm or sends a picture of the intruder by e-mail. Spykee also
can climb stairs, operate as a Skype VoIP phone and Webcam, stream video
to your PC and get itself to its charging station when its battery is
low. The product is produced by Meccano-Erector and will be available
for around $299 at Amazon.com and Fat Brain Toys.

Thanks to the French for bringing us such a portable package of Linux
fun! The Archos 704 is a multimedia player that, with its 7" display and
80GB hard drive, is big enough to watch yet small enough to bring along
wherever. The 704 also has built-in Wi-Fi for Web surfing on the town.
Expect at least five hours of video playback, five hours of Web surfing or 16
hours of music. There is also a kit that allows you to capture video and
audio from the field. Most video and audio formats are supported, though
some codecs (MPEG-1 and MPEG-2) must be purchased. Suggested retail
price is $550, but the street price is closer to $400. Also check out
Archos' on-line store for refurbished devices.

<h2 class="title">A Business Case for Linux at Scale</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #164, December 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The trick with what we call scale is an alignment of technology, use
and business models. For example, the Linux kernel itself has no
business model, any more than does geology or the periodic table. What
we call kernel space is low-level, foundational. In that role, it
supports the vast region we call user space. This is where
applications live. Here, there may or may not be business models. Apache
itself has no business model, although it supports all kinds of
business through its enormous &ldquo;because effects&rdquo;. That is, far more money
is made <span   class="emphasis"><em>because of</em></span> Apache than
<span   class="emphasis"><em>with</em></span> it. However, there still is plenty of
money to be made with Linux, Apache and other foundational members of
the LAMP stack, especially if you provide those foundations in reliable
ways at costs lower than customers would pay to do it themselves.
</p><p>
Yet, DIY always has been at the heart of Linux Love, going back to when
Linus Torvalds DIY'd Linux in the first place. That's why the sweet spot
for large providers of Linux servers is to make DIY easy for experts
and the customers of experts. The hosting business has been doing this
since the dawn of the ISP. But, lately, Amazon has taken fresh advantage
of its own scale as a huge company by providing limitless low-cost
storage and compute foundations through AWSes (Amazon Web Services), best
known as S3 (Simple Storage Service) and EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud).
With these, Amazon offers storage and compute power as raw utilities akin
to electric, gas and water services. Will S3, EC2 and its inevitable
competitors support the same kind of growth in the virtual world that
those more elemental utilities have long supported in the physical
world? So far, it looks like the answer is yes.
</p><p>
Let's take one DIY example from the far end of user space: creating
audio and video productions. Here, we have a startup called Animoto
(<a href="http://www.animoto.com" target="_self">www.animoto.com</a>), which mashes the skills of experienced TV
and film producers with users' videos, music and images. At the back end,
Animoto uses both S3 and EC2. Connecting Animoto's front and Amazon's
back ends is a new company called RightScale. Thorsten von Eicken, CEO
and founder of RightScale, says his company &ldquo;provides the management
platform, expertise and key critical components (load-balanced Web
front end, MySQL master/slave, grid manager) to help companies focus on
their core competencies that differentiate their businesses rather than
the 'muck' of infrastructure&rdquo;.
</p><p>
So, how exactly does RightScale do the mucking for the likes of Animoto?
Here's Thorsten von Eicken again:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We provide a server deployment and management platform that provides
open deployment recipes that users can inspect and customize. We
call this &ldquo;open deployment&rdquo;. For example, we just made a
&ldquo;Rails
all-in-one&rdquo; server template available that contains a dozen recipes
for installing an entire Rails app stack on an EC2 instance, from
front-end load balancing across the Rails app processes to MySQL and
periodic backups to Amazon S3. Each of these recipes is a shell
script that installs some RPMs and customizes the installation for
Rails. As a whole, the server template allows users to simply plug in
the SVN repository holding their Rails app and launch the server,
all in less than ten minutes.
</p><p>
But the point here is that users get not only the complete server
template, but also all the recipes in open-source form. They can see
how we install, say, Apache and set up the vhosts for ports 80 and 443
for their Rails app. If something breaks or they simply want to set up
things differently (perhaps they don't want to 
redirect from HTTP to HTTPS automatically on the home page), they can clone our
Apache config script, modify it and insert theirs into the server
template. Now they have the same power, but customized.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Making this possible, in addition to the likes of Amazon, is a critical
mass of open-source tools and building materials. But, even if the parts
are free, the labor isn't. This is what creates opportunities for
companies like RightScale. &ldquo;Cloud computing on commodity hardware
requires some rethinking: load balancing in software on 'front-end
nodes', rsync-like backups to Amazon S3, dealing with dynamic DNS for
round-robin DNS entries, coordinating servers in novel ways, and many
more that can be solved by putting together pieces from the vast open-source toolkit and making minor changes where necessary&rdquo;, von Eicken
says, adding, &ldquo;Of course, RightScale, being a Rails site, is built 100% on
open-source components, but which startup these days isn't?&rdquo;
</p><p>
Which moots the question of how you can make money with Linux and open
source.

Jeremy Ruston started work on TiddlyWiki in September 2004, and in
August 2007, called it &ldquo;a moderately active and successful
open-source project&rdquo;. He's being modest. At the time of this
writing (mid-September 2007),
Google finds more than 8 million pages that mention TiddlyWiki, with
2,320,000 of those also mentioning Linux.
</p><p>
TiddlyWiki is a breed apart. Variously described as &ldquo;a reusable
nonlinear personal Web notebook&rdquo;, a &ldquo;one-file wiki&rdquo;,
&ldquo;a wiki-modeled
client-side single-page application&rdquo; and more, none of the labels
are as
simple as TiddlyWiki itself: a small standalone HTML file that contains
all the JavaScript and CSS it needs to do what it does, which is to give
you a simple and straightforward way to write and organize linked and
tagged text inside a simple client-side file.
</p><p>
Rather than pages, TiddlyWiki uses &ldquo;tiddlers&rdquo;&mdash;chunks of text you can
write, edit, show, hide, tag, shuffle and otherwise manipulate in a
variety of ways. Using it reminds me both of blogs and outliners, yet
it's different than both because it's nonlinear and non-hierarchical.
</p><p>
Mostly, it's handy. It's a way of writing in any browser, on or off the
Web, in a form that easily can be posted, e-mailed or put on a thumbdrive
for what the TiddlyWiki folks call &ldquo;Wiki-on-a-Stick&rdquo;.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Our scope is intentionally small&rdquo;, Ruston says. &ldquo;It's
unique to client-side development&rdquo; and ideal for many purposes
small and large&mdash;&ldquo;building
customizable user experiences&rdquo;, for example.
</p><p>
TiddlyWiki also is permutational, with many versions, variations,
plugins, macros and arcane uses. There are even client-side hosting
sites for folks who need it. Checking it out could hardly be easier. For
that, go to <a href="http://tiddlywiki.org" target="_self">tiddlywiki.org</a>.
</p><p>
And, see if you can come up with a one-word name for its breed.

<h2 class="title">Top Ten Reasons You Should Load Linux on a Laptop</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Mark Rais</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #164, December 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Number 10:</b></span>
No more listening to monologues about the merits of Vista over
Windows XP. As your friends describe the security improvements and begin
salivating about the powerful new features, you can stop them cold by
declaring, &ldquo;I'm not upgrading; I'm switching to Linux.&rdquo; You'll have
them high-tailing it out of your house screaming,
&ldquo;blasphemer!&rdquo; The sight
alone should be well worth it.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Number 9:</b></span>
Installing Linux ensures that you will save yourself a bundle of money,
not only at the register, but also in years to come&mdash;no need to pay for
countless upgrades.
Visit your favorite local computer retailer and drift through the
aisles filled with various laptops. When salespeople approach you
and begin touting why a certain laptop is a great deal because it comes
with the Microsoft Office Professional package, wave them off.
Walk a little farther down the aisle; purchase the absolute top-end
laptop that does not include any Microsoft applications. As the
salespeople
explain that you will be paying hundreds of dollars more because you will need
to add Office, simply smile and pay with your charge card of choice.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Number 8:</b></span>
End the constant late-night computer assistance calls from your
&ldquo;buddies&rdquo;. They call because, &ldquo;you're the computer pro,
right?&rdquo; When
they call you again, tell them, &ldquo;Sorry, I have no idea how
to do that, I use Linux.&rdquo; You'll never hear from them again.
They'll find
someone else with Vista and bug them! The pleasures with
Linux laptops are endless.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Number 7:</b></span>
You will love the look on your family members' faces at the holiday party, when
Granny figures out how easy it can be to use Linux. Can you imagine
everyone gathering around your laptop, as Granny cranks up the sound on
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Frozen Bubble</em></span>, and everyone starts doing the humpty-hump? Okay, maybe not.
But, there's nothing that livens a good family gathering like 16
mugs of eggnog and a Linux game.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Number 6:</b></span>
Good-looking people love Linux system
administrators. Paste Linux stickers over the various Microsoft ones
and enjoy your Linux laptop at the mall. Passersby will note the air
of confidence and energy you present as you type away.
Soon enough, extremely gorgeous people will begin to stop and sit down beside
you on the bench. You can answer in the affirmative, when they
inquire,
&ldquo;Pardon me, is that Linux you're using?&rdquo; As they smile, recall a
few facts. The average Linux system administrator makes more money
than law enforcement officers in their tenth year of work or nurse
practitioners serving with your local hospital. Job security, money and
power attract people like a chocolate sundae served with a cherry on top.
Your Linux laptop is the cherry.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Number 5:</b></span>
Installing Linux on a
laptop has never been easier. Most flavors now come with the latest
drivers, and installation is seamless. Even more important, Linux
installation on a laptop averages about 28 minutes for a complete
setup. Compare this to the installation of an upgrade of Vista on a
Windows XP laptop, which can take more than an hour, and you'll see why Linux
on a laptop is not just a good idea, it's a major time-saver!
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Number 4:</b></span>
Sleep more peacefully than most, because Linux on your laptop
resolves many security-related concerns. For instance, you no longer
have to toss and turn in bed worrying about issues like Microsoft
Vista's Remote Code Execution Vulnerability, the threat of the GPCoder.h
trojan and the JS/Downloader-AUD malware. In fact, most recent viruses
and malware utilize vulnerabilities found with Windows, not Linux.
Moreover, even if a hack attack on your laptop occurs, you are smart
enough to know that using a nonroot login results in an isolated attack.
Okay, so not all of these reasons are funny, but they are important.
Besides, you may get a good laugh when you hear what happens to people
who don't use Linux.

Number 3:</b></span>
Stop annoying friends who are always asking to borrow your
laptop to do this and that. The next time they ask if they can
&ldquo;just borrow the laptop to do some work&rdquo;, simply switch the mode so that
it defaults to the command line. Hand over the laptop and enjoy seeing
their faces as they ask, &ldquo;what the heck happened?&rdquo; You can retort by saying,
&ldquo;I installed Linux.&rdquo; They will step away from the table, look at you and
yell out a number of expletives. As they walk away, never to be heard
from again, switch back to KDE with Beryl.

See the raw power of Linux running on a laptop. Recently, a
friend of mine connected his laptop that contained a mirror image of his
company's intranet site. As the computer team was dealing with a total
outage of its intranet server, the site kept running with a simple
DNS change. The boss asked him what server he was using to 
run the site temporarily. He simply pointed down to his laptop. Linux adds a real
Nitrous Oxide injection to any laptop.

Gain friends and supporters
from around the world. In fact, Linux is now used in every country of
the world. Moreover, people in countries like Andorra, Eritrea and
Kyrgyzstan are happy to help with any concerns you have using Linux.
Adding Linux on your laptop opens a whole new world of friendships
and camaraderie. Most Linux Web sites today have communities from more
than
150 countries! So, if for nothing else, install Linux on that laptop
to gain access to one of the most supportive communities on earth.
