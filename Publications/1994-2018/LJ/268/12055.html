Traveling doesn't have to mean time off work.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15d5580.0x16cd358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last year about this time, I wrote a short article about my &ldquo;Network Go
Bag&rdquo;. During the past year, I've gotten lots of email about that bag
and actually quite a few questions about working while traveling in
general. This month, I'm traveling again, so I thought I'd put together
the &ldquo;How I Do It&rdquo; information into a single article. I often write about
what I use, so you've probably already heard of some of these things,
but nonetheless, here it goes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15d5580.0x16cd5c0"></a>
Work Area</h2></div></div><p>
Usually, if I'm staying at a hotel while traveling, there will be
some sort of desk in the room that I can take over as a temporary
workstation. The room I'm in this week doesn't actually have a desk, so I
had to run to the local department store and buy a table. Figure 1 shows
the table I bought. It was $29, and I have no idea how I'm going to fit
it into the car to bring home. You can't see the chair in the photo, but
it's a folding chair I &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; from a conference room. Metal folding
chairs hurt your rear end after a while, so for a cushion, I'm sitting
on a bag of dirty clothes. Yes, I travel in style, and I'm super classy.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12055f1.large.jpg"><img src="12055f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Yep, that's a party-size bag of saltwater taffy&mdash;and about 
50 empty wrappers.
</p></div></div><p>
The other side of the room has a little nightstand (Figure 2), which was
oddly placed nowhere near the bed. That's okay, because I used the table
to set up a coffee station. The room also didn't have a coffee pot, so
I picked up this single-serve Keurig-compatible coffee pot for $29. It's
terrible. Seriously, if I reviewed coffee pots for a living, this would
be my example of the worst coffee pot I've ever used. Still, I can't
work in a room without coffee, so for the week, I'll just suffer. But
I'm leaving this pot here; I don't want it at home. (And yes, I don't
eat terribly healthy on the road. Ramen is about it. You can cook
only so many things with a subpar, single-serve coffee pot.)

Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
I won't go back over all the stuff in my Network Go Bag, but you can read
about it in the August 2015 issue
if you're really interested (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/googlesearch?s=My%2520Network%2520Go-Bag" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/googlesearch?s=My%2520Network%2520Go-Bag</a>).
Basically, I carry
a router, a Wi-Fi extender, network cabling and extension cords. I've been
in a situation where I tied my Wi-Fi extender inside a grocery bag with
a lithium-ion battery and happily had Wi-Fi access in a cabin outside
of range. I was my own superhero.
</p><p>
Once the gasping stops (yes, that's an 11" MacBook Air laptop shown in
Figure 1). It's the best laptop I've ever owned, and I'm willing to take
the shame for using an Apple product. First, it has the nicest keyboard
I've ever used on a laptop. (I can't say the same for the newer MacBook
12" keyboard.) It's tiny, has 8GB of RAM, an i7 processor and a big
512GB SSD. I can run VMware Fusion and host Ubuntu MATE 16.04, and it
runs better than it does natively on any other laptop I've owned. Plus,
I'd be lying if I said I didn't use MacOS as well. Sometimes when I'm
presenting, the only &ldquo;projector&rdquo; access is an AppleTV using
AirPlay. With
the MacOS running, I can share my screen and do all my demos inside
VMware. Plus, the aluminum chassis is so thin, I probably could sword
fight ninjas with it, should the need ever arise.
</p><p>
Apart from the laptop, I sometimes have to print handouts (I do this
week), so I have a USB laser printer I tote along (also shown in Figure 1). I
know there are truly portable printers, but since I almost always
drive, something a little bigger isn't a problem, and it's a whole lot
cheaper. This model is a Brother HL-L2320D, and it prints fairly fast. It
also has a duplexer, so really, for less than $100, I'm not complaining.
</p><p>
For mobile data when Wi-Fi isn't available, I used to carry a MiFi
device everywhere I went. It was awesome. Since at that time I worked
for a school, I could literally get <span   class="emphasis"><em>unlimited</em></span> 4G data, and it cost the
school $35/month. That unlimited deal was available only for schools,
and thanks to people like me, it's probably not available even for
schools anymore. Nowadays, I just tether to one of my phones. I always
carry two. My day job provides an iPhone 6s on the Verizon network, and I
have a personal Moto-E using Cricket Wireless (Figure 3). Since I
have both AT&amp;T and Verizon networks at my disposal, I almost always have
connectivity. If I do much more traveling, I'll invest in one of those
&ldquo;Karma Go&rdquo; devices (<a href="http://www.yourkarma.com" target="_self">www.yourkarma.com</a>), so I have access to the Sprint
network in a pinch. So far, I haven't needed it, but if I ever decide to
do an extended road trip, I'll probably have to do that.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12055f3.large.jpg"><img src="12055f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. I've honestly never spoken on this phone. I don't even know
if the phone part works!
</p></div></div><p>
The only other things I carry with me, hardware-wise, are power-related. I
have a 12v inverter for the car that gives me 120v AC on the go. I
also have a big 24,000mah lithium ion battery (I got it from woot.com
on special) charged up and ready for dying devices. My Anker five-port USB
charger (Figure 4) is still the charger I use for mobile devices, and
with that combination, I've never run short on juice. I kind of want to get
a portable solar panel so I can top off my batteries during sunny days,
but I don't really need that. I just want it!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12055f4.large.jpg"><img src="12055f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. I reviewed this back in the September 2014 issue. It's the Anker
40w five-port
charger, and it's awesome.

Software</h2></div></div><p>
I've talked about software before, but things change from time to time,
so my most current batch of &ldquo;must-have&rdquo; software includes the
following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
BittorrentSync: this works amazingly well. I have it installed on all
of my computers and laptops, and also on my big file server at home. My
goal is to move all my documents to BittorrentSync.
</p></li><li><p>
Dropbox: I'm still a little chicken, and I haven't moved all my
documents over to BittorrentSync. There's really no reason I haven't,
except for the occasional time I need to share a file with a public
link. BittorrentSync doesn't do that yet (I don't think it does
anyway), and I've used Dropbox for so long, it's hard to switch. Plus,
I have approximately 24GB of free Dropbox storage that I earned with
a slightly shady Google Adwords campaign, so I feel like I should take
advantage of my ill-gotten gain.
</p></li><li><p>
Bean: yes, Bean the OS X text editor. I use Bean to write articles for
two main reasons. First, it has a running word count on the bottom of the
window, so I know exactly how much I've blabbered. I can't find any decent
text editor that does the same on Linux. All the ones I've tried get
annoying after a little while. Second, when I try to do work on Linux, I
get distracted. For some reason, two sentences into an article I find myself
SSH'd into multiple servers, playing with Docker containers. When
I'm using the native MacOS, I tend to get more actual work done.
</p></li><li><p>
Crashplan: because backups aren't just important, they're vital. Did
you notice that in last month's issue there wasn't an Open-Source Classroom
column? That's because I had a system crash, and my work hadn't been
backed up yet. The world might never know the mysteries of running a
syslog server, because I don't think I have the strength to write my
article over again.
</p></li><li><p>
Final Cut Pro: I know, I know, you're losing faith in my Linux
passion. Here's the deal, Kris Occhipinti&mdash;I've mentioned him often
through the years, as he's a fellow reader and friend (Figure 5)&mdash;somehow
gets his Linux video editing software to work amazingly well. Either
I expect too much out of an editing package, or he is a much better
technologist than I am. Since all I need from an editor is to overlay
some text for the intro video every month, I suspect he's just better
than I am. Nonetheless, for now, I use Final Cut Pro because it works.
</p></li><li><p>
TeamViewer (free version): this works on Linux, Mac and Windows, and
it works amazingly well through NAT services. I know there recently
was a data breach where all the logins and passwords were stolen, but as
long as you don't leave it set for unattended access, it's a perfect way
to help family members while you're away. In fact, my home router stopped
forwarding SSH traffic, and I was able to use TeamViewer to log in to my
office computer with the help of my daughter and fix the router
remotely.
</p></li><li><p>
Evernote/Simplenote: I use Evernote for storing pretty much
everything. The more I store, the more useful it is. I just discovered
Simplenote, however, and for text, I might switch over. Based on my
&ldquo;switch&rdquo; from Dropbox though, I'm not holding my breath, but I really do love
the simplicity of Simplenote. Plus, it's open source now, and that does
matter to me.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12055f5.large.jpg"><img src="12055f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Entertainment</h2></div></div><p>
It will likely come as no surprise that going out &ldquo;partying&rdquo; isn't
really my cup of tea. A nice cup of tea is more my cup of tea. So when
I'm traveling, I tend to bring along my own entertainment. I have a
bunch of different options, because I tend to be fickle.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Books: I usually take an actual dead-tree book or two with me whenever I
go somewhere. I'm currently reading <span   class="emphasis"><em>How to Keep Your Volkswagen
Alive</em></span>
by John Muir because I recently bought a 1975 Volkswagen Beetle. It
turns out I'm not much of a mechanic, so I'm reading a book about
it&mdash;you
know, like any nerd does. Can you learn to maintain a car by reading a
book? I'll find out soon (Figure 6).
</p></li><li><p>
Kindle Paperwhite: I know there's a new model of the Kindle available,
but my Kindle Paperwhite works fine for me. I don't actually read as much
as I'd like on it, but I keep forcing myself to use it, because I know
it's the way of the future. I usually keep a ton of sci-fi and fantasy
books on it, which I've stored, converted and uploaded via Calibre. I
also keep my entire Calibre library on my laptop, so I always
can add more books from my collection if I don't want to buy one from the
Kindle store.
</p></li><li><p>
Listen: most of my &ldquo;reading&rdquo; is done via audiobook. I love Audible,
but I hate its app. Listen is hands-down the nicest, most incredible
audiobook player I've ever used. It's an Android-only app and worth
every penny. (I think it was $3.) I use FolderSync on Android to keep my
audiobook folder up to date, and I just copy the audiobooks I want into
a sync folder on my home server. Every night it does an SSH/rsync copy
of books to my phone. Oh, and I use an LG HBS-730 Bluetooth headset for
listening to the books. I imagine I could talk on the phone with the
headset too, but I've never talked on that phone because who actually
&ldquo;talks&rdquo; on phones anymore? (Okay, it's because my day-job phone has the
number everyone calls.) Anyway, the combination of Listen, FolderSync
and those LG headphones supplies about 90% of the entertainment on any
given trip for me.
</p></li><li><p>
Plex: I seem to write about Plex every other issue. I'd apologize, but
oh my goodness is Plex awesome. Now it even syncs photos from my family's
phones, so we can all see each other's uploaded pictures if we want, even
on the big screen. Nevertheless, Plex is perfect for remote entertainment,
but beware of using cellular data to watch movies, because it eats up data
quickly.
</p></li><li><p>
Fox Sports Go: what? Sports? Yeah, I know. I'm going to have to turn in
my nerd card. First I use a Mac, and now I watch sports? It's really only
one sport&mdash;baseball. I'm not sure if it's because of all the statistics,
or because I can watch a baseball game while doing something
else and not miss anything. I really love watching baseball, and the
Fox Sports Go app might suck, but it lets me stream baseball games,
even when I'm in the &ldquo;blackout&rdquo; areas.
</p></li><li><p>
MLB App: sometimes I don't have the bandwidth to stream the video of
a baseball game, so I use the MLB app to listen. Seriously, I have no
idea why I like baseball so much, but I do. Go Tigers!
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12055f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Only I could make auto mechanics nerdy.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15d5580.0x1ac7758"></a>
That and Pants!</h2></div></div><p>
Apart from regular mundane things like dad shorts (cargo shorts&mdash;I'm pretty sure dads everywhere have agreed to wear nothing else) and
flip-flops, that's about all I take while I'm traveling. I do usually
take a backup laptop in case something goes wrong and, of course, a pair
of emergency pants. If you've ever presented to 1,000 people with coffee-stained pants, you know exactly what I mean.
</p><p>
One of these years I'd like to take an extended road trip with my wife
and work from the road while we travel. I'm sure my go-bag will change
significantly during that trip. All I need to do is buy that 1970s
Volkswagen Westfalia camper (Figure 7) and convince my wife it'll be the
trip of a lifetime! If you have any special travel oddities or tips, I'd
love to hear about them. And heck, if you have a 1970s Westfalia camper,
I'd love to hear about that too! Drop me an email at
