John McPhee says his books on geology could all be compressed to a single statement:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>the summit of Mt. Everest is marine limestone</em></span>. We can do the same for Linux with this
one: <span   class="emphasis"><em>microsoft.com is hosted on Linux</em></span>. According to Netcraft, so are dozens of other
Microsoft sites and services
(<a href="http://searchdns.netcraft.com/?restriction=site+contains&amp;host=microsoft.com&amp;lookup=wait..&amp;position=limited" target="_self">searchdns.netcraft.com/?restriction=site+contains&amp;host=microsoft.com&amp;lookup=wait..&amp;position=limited</a>).
</p><p>
For much of Linux's early history, Microsoft was an enemy&mdash;maybe even
<span   class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> enemy. Even as late as 2001, Steve Ballmer,
Microsoft's CEO and ball-buster-in-chief, called Linux a &ldquo;cancer&rdquo;
(<a href="https://slashdot.org/story/01/06/01/1658258/ballmer-calls-linux-a-cancer" target="_self">https://slashdot.org/story/01/06/01/1658258/ballmer-calls-linux-a-cancer</a>).
Yet, Microsoft introduced its own Linux distro in 2003
(<a href="http://www.mslinux.org" target="_self">www.mslinux.org</a>), and by 2011 (according to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Weekly News</em></span>), Microsoft was
the fifth largest corporate contributor to the Linux kernel
(<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/top-five-linux-contributor-microsoft" target="_self">www.zdnet.com/article/top-five-linux-contributor-microsoft</a>)&mdash;and
Ballmer was still in charge. In November 2014,
new Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company &ldquo;loves Linux&rdquo;
(<a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/10/microsoft-loves-linux-as-it-makes-azure-bigger-better" target="_self">arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/10/microsoft-loves-linux-as-it-makes-azure-bigger-better</a>).
And why not?
</p><p>
As Linus put it to <span   class="emphasis"><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></span> earlier
this year, &ldquo;if you're creating some new Internet infrastructure
or whatever, I'm almost surprised when it doesn't run Linux&rdquo;
(<a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/linux-at-25-qa-with-linus-torvalds" target="_self">spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/linux-at-25-qa-with-linus-torvalds</a>).
Microsoft makes a lot of &ldquo;whatever&rdquo;, and it unsurprisingly described
Azure Cloud Switch, introduced in September 2015, as &ldquo;a cross-platform
modular operating system for data center networking built on Linux&rdquo;
(<a href="http://blogs.microsoft.com/firehose/2015/09/18/microsoft-flicks-on-azure-cloud-switch-an-os-built-on-linux/#sm.0001dhc7pdc62ehaw801mzbdiezar" target="_self">blogs.microsoft.com/firehose/2015/09/18/microsoft-flicks-on-azure-cloud-switch-an-os-built-on-linux/#sm.0001dhc7pdc62ehaw801mzbdiezar</a>).
At the time, 20% of the company's virtual machines (VMs) on Azure (its
cloud computing platform) already ran on Linux. I'll bet even more do now.
</p><p>
We see similar developments on the mobile front. For example,
last year Microsoft invested in the Android developer Cyanogen
(<a href="https://www.cyngn.com" target="_self">https://www.cyngn.com</a>), the corporate spin-off of open-source (and
Android/Linux-based) CyanogenMod (<a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org" target="_self">www.cyanogenmod.org</a>) and
maker of the commercial CyanogenOS (<a href="https://cyngn.com/cyanogen-os" target="_self">https://cyngn.com/cyanogen-os</a>). As I
write this, Microsoft is laying off Windows Phone workers by the thousands
(<a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2459340/microsoft-axes-1-850-more-staff-from-mobile-biz-as-windows-phone-goes-into-freefall" target="_self">www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2459340/microsoft-axes-1-850-more-staff-from-mobile-biz-as-windows-phone-goes-into-freefall</a>),
while using its Cyanogen partnership to bring Microsoft apps
and services into the massive Android world of mobile everything
(<a href="http://www.thecountrycaller.com/29464-microsoft-corporations-msft-strategic-cyanogen-partnership-manifests-into-platform-integration" target="_self">www.thecountrycaller.com/29464-microsoft-corporations-msft-strategic-cyanogen-partnership-manifests-into-platform-integration</a>).
</p><p>
As it happens, this month (August 2016) is the 25th anniversary
of Linus' Usenet post announcing the birth of Linux,
which at the time had no name and Linus called &ldquo;just a hobby&rdquo;
(<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.os.minix/dlNtH7RRrGA/SwRavCzVE7gJ" target="_self">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.os.minix/dlNtH7RRrGA/SwRavCzVE7gJ</a>).
He closed that post saying his new OS &ldquo;probably never will support
anything other than AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(&rdquo;
</p><p>
Now all ten hosts on Netcraft's list
of the world's Most Reliable Hosting Company Sites

run on Linux :-)
</p><p>
The problem with that smiley is that it says Happily Ever After, which is what you
reach at the end of a story, not what you have at the beginning or the middle of one.
As I said here in June 2016, all stories are about conflict, and Linux seems done with
those.
</p><p>
To stay interested (and interesting, which is our job as a magazine), we
need some new fights. In that same article, I listed five possibilities,
all (at least hopefully) dear to the hearts and minds of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> readers. In this article, I'll dive into one of those:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Decentralization and Distributed Everything</em></span>. And,
I'll do it by focusing on the mission of one guy: Kevin Cox
(<a href="https://kevinrosscox.me" target="_self">https://kevinrosscox.me</a>), of Canberra, Australia.
</p><p>
I first met Kevin a few years ago at a conference in Munich. What most
impressed me about Kevin was that he had, to my knowledge, the only
digital identity business that gave full respect to the autonomous and
independent natures of individual human beings and each connection
those human beings might have to any other party, without relying on
a central authority. In this way, his system embodied a quality Brian
Behlendorf (<a href="http://brian.behlendorf.com" target="_self">brian.behlendorf.com</a>) calls <span   class="emphasis"><em>minimum viable
centralization</em></span>.
</p><p>
Not long after that conference, Kevin sold his company (which has since
disappeared into its acquirer) and started thinking and working more
deeply on liberating each of us from the clutches of centralization
and making <span   class="emphasis"><em>distributed everything</em></span> not only work,
but out-scale anything centralized.
</p><p>
When I asked Kevin to help me grok where he's headed
these days, he told me to start with Cory Doctorow's
talk at the Decentralized Web Summit in early June 2016
(<a href="http://boingboing.net/2016/06/09/internet-greybeards-and-upstar.html" target="_self">boingboing.net/2016/06/09/internet-greybeards-and-upstar.html</a>).
Cory's one slide in the talk is of &ldquo;Ulysses and the Sirens&rdquo;, John William
Waterhouse's 1891 painting based on Homer's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Odyssey</em></span> (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12053f1.large.jpg"><img src="12053f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. John William Waterhouse's &ldquo;Ulysses and the Sirens&rdquo; (1891)
</p></div></div><p>
In the painting, we see Ulysses tied to the mast of his ship at his own request
so he won't be tempted toward rocky shores by the beautiful 
Sirens. (Those are the birds with female faces. They don't look tempting
to me, but I suppose they were porn for Waterhouse.) Cory says this
illustrates &ldquo;'Ulysses pacts': bargains you make with yourself when your
willpower is strong to prevent giving into temptation later when you
are tired or demoralized, and how these have benefited the web to date,
and how new, better ones can protect the decentralized web of the future&rdquo;
(<a href="http://boingboing.net/2016/06/09/how-will-we-keep-the-decentral.html" target="_self">boingboing.net/2016/06/09/how-will-we-keep-the-decentral.html</a>).
</p><p>
The temptation Kevin would save us from is dependence on third parties of
any kind, even things like OpenID (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID</a>)
and blockchains (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_(database)" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_(database)</a>). He
says &ldquo;these take things away from your autonomy. You cannot suddenly
decide that you no longer want to be identified with a blockchain
identity. You cannot ditch your OpenID any more than you can easily
change your email address.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Next Kevin points me to promise theory
(<a href="https://kevinrosscox.me/2016/06/02/promise-theory-and-financial-systems" target="_self">https://kevinrosscox.me/2016/06/02/promise-theory-and-financial-systems</a>),
which Wikipedia defines as &ldquo;a model of voluntary cooperation
between individual, autonomous actors or agents who publish
their intentions to one another in the form of promises&rdquo;
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Promise_theory&amp;oldid=724357922" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Promise_theory&amp;oldid=724357922</a>).
In other words, promises work without a central authority or any kind
of command and control system other than the individual's own.
</p><p>
This is a conceptual stretch for most of us computer types, because
command and control is embodied in computer architecture, operations
and programming. But they are not embodied in free societies. Holding
those together are a matrix of promises, also known as agreements and
understandings. In <span   class="emphasis"><em>Angels and Ages</em></span>, Adam Gopnik's
excellent short book on Lincoln and Darwin (who were born the same day
in history), he writes, &ldquo;Law is the practice of rules in the context of
deals, and Lincoln believed in both.&rdquo; Law is command and control. Deals
are promises.
</p><p>
Most deals are not formal, but even the formal ones we call contracts
simply certify agreements between two consenting parties (though
technically, more can be involved). They don't require a third
party. Government gets involved only when enforcement is at issue.
</p><p>
Mark Burgess (<a href="http://markburgess.org" target="_self">markburgess.org</a>) first shared promise theory in
a chapter of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ambient Networks</em></span> (Springer, 2004)
titled &ldquo;An Approach to Understanding Policy Based on Autonomy and Voluntary
Cooperation&rdquo; (<a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F11568285_9" target="_self">link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F11568285_9</a>). Ten
years later, he wrote about it in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/promise-theory%E2%80%94what-it" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/promise-theory&mdash;what-it</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
In a promise-based design, each part behaves only according to the promises it makes
to others. Instead of instructions from without, we have behavior promised from
within. Since the promises are made by &ldquo;self&rdquo; (human self or machine self), it means
that the decision is always made with knowledge of the same circumstances under which
implementation will take place....
</p><p>
A promise-oriented view is somewhat like a service view. Instead of trying to
remote-control things with strings and levers, one makes use of an ecosystem of
promised services that advertise intent and offer a basic level of certainty about how
they will behave. Promises are about expectation management, and knowing the services
and their properties that will help us to compose a working system.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Promises, he says, scale:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
...biology has selected redundant services as its model for scaling tissue-based
organisms. This offers a strong clue that we are on the right track. Avoiding strong
dependencies is a way to avoid bottlenecks, so this shows the route to scalability.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Yet, he also warns:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Autonomy and standalone thinking seem to fly in the face of what we normally learn
about programming&mdash;that is, to share resources, but this is not necessarily
true. Security and scalability both thrive under autonomy, and complexity melts away
when the dependencies between parts are removed and all control is from within.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Within the promise, that is. (You can read more about promise theory
in Mark's book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Thinking in Promises</em></span>, published by
O'Reilly in 2015.)
</p><p>
According to mathematical sociology
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_sociology" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_sociology</a>),
promises work across weak interpersonal ties
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_ties#Weak_tie_hypothesis" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_ties#Weak_tie_hypothesis</a>).
Says Wikipedia, &ldquo;Weak social ties, it is argued, are responsible for the
majority of the embeddedness and structure of social networks in society
as well as the transmission of information through these networks.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The other two kinds of ties are <span   class="emphasis"><em>strong</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>absent</em></span>. What we have in computing are mostly
strong ties. Those are what enable us to issue commands and to build
centralized products and services. Looking at Facebook through the
framework of mathematical sociology, we see a gigantic service with
strong ties to billions of human dependents who do their best to operate
within the company's centralized system, paid for by a B2B advertising
business. In spite of being called a &ldquo;social network&rdquo;, Facebook cannot
scale human promises in truly social ways, because it doesn't support
the weak ties that comprise genuine social networking&mdash;nor can other
centralized organizations, such as banks, governments and large retailers.
</p><p>
Yet the internet can do that, since its own geology is a set of simple
protocols, which are nothing more than agreements between computing
entities at end points. Its protocols say information packets should
be sent between end points by whatever routes look best along the way,
and retransmitted when packets are dropped. These protocols are not
encumbered by billing, or any business model, and there is no central
entity controlling them. The internet's success is a demonstration of
promise theory at work on a worldwide scale. Those of us on it comprise
a rising tide of weak ties that lifts everything that floats on it,
including giant corporate pyramids.
</p><p>
The net is also an ideal environment for scaling up countless promises
between autonomous entities, unencumbered by the need for anything
underneath to create scarcities or to impose operational or regulatory
burdens.
</p><p>
The new promises Kevin wants to start with are hacks on the
economy. Specifically, he wants us all to &ldquo;take control of our own
money&rdquo;
by &ldquo;removing half the cost of financing the production of goods and
services&rdquo;. That cost is financial institutions. He says we don't need
them any more than the internet needs a central operator. He also says
we can scale up far more economic activity and wealth generation with
an economy that emerges from our autonomous activity, based on promises
between entities that don't need third parties.
</p><p>
For example, instead of going to banks or other third parties
for loans or savings, we can go to each other. Kevin calls this
<span   class="emphasis"><em>envesting</em></span>, which he describes in an email as:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
...a beneficial mutation of a bank loan, which is nothing more than a transfer of
value over time.
</p><p>
Envesting creates more value for the same amount of money as a bank loan. Bank loans
create debt, which is expensive money that we must repay.
</p><p>
Bank loans themselves can be thought of as a mutation to the exchange of value. The
mechanism for creating bank loans is that the bank creates new money, then lends it.
When the loan is repaid with money, the bank destroys the money.
</p><p>
Banks do not have to do it that way. They can lend money they have in their bank
without creating more; and lots of financial institutions do. It is the creation and
destruction of money that leads to inefficiencies.
</p><p>
The creation of money increases cost the more we create. Cost increases exponentially
with the number of loans. This makes loans expensive.
</p><p>
Remove the need to create money and you have zero cost money. In fact, you already
have it, in the deposits of savers. There is no cost of creation by using those funds
to lend.
</p><p>
The loan is still the same. We exchange value and if there is a long transfer time, we
return a little bit more value. 
</p><p>
Envesting does not create extra money, like traditional bank lending. Instead it
creates a form of money we call a voucher, or a prepayment, or a reward, or a coupon.
These tokens are simple because you do not need a financial system to control them,
and because they represent real goods (e.g. your house) and services. And, since we do
not need the financial system to manage these instruments, we do not have to pay for
an extraneous system that doesn't create any value for us.
</p><p>
In his book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Killing the Host: How Financial Parasites and Debt Bondage Destroy the
Global Economy</em></span>
(<a href="http://michael-hudson.com/2015/09/killing-the-host-the-book" target="_self">michael-hudson.com/2015/09/killing-the-host-the-book</a>), Michael Hudson explains how the financial sector has taken over the
real economy. With envesting, we have a mutation that can immunize the real economy
from that parasite. It can also be easily copied and applied in many different ways
for many different loans.
</p><p>
When we use fungible money to repay loans we have strong connections between loans.
When we repay loans with product or percentage of ownership, we have weak connections,
which is good. This change to the way we repay loans will reduce the cost of making
loans. The total savings is likely to equal the full value of the loan.
</p><p>
Using this approach for buying a house with rent rather than with repaying a money
loan results in cost savings to both renter and saver. For example, here is the cost
to buy a house with rent compared to a money loan: <a href="https://kevinrosscox.me/2016/06/03/existing-borrower" target="_self">https://kevinrosscox.me/2016/06/03/existing-borrower</a>. And here is the income
to a saver
who lends money to a renter, compared to lending money to a bank: <a href="https://kevinrosscox.me/2016/06/03/comparison-between-annuity-and-rent-and-buy-loans" target="_self">https://kevinrosscox.me/2016/06/03/comparison-between-annuity-and-rent-and-buy-loans</a>.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Kevin calls these arrangements &ldquo;rent and buy loans&rdquo;. These are bankless
loans involving just two parties. The original owner continues to own
the property, like the bank holds collateral, until the loan is paid
off, and ownership is transferred. The payments in the meantime are
like rent. And the cost for the buyer is a lot lower. He also explains
(<a href="https://kevinrosscox.me/2016/06/03/why-rent-and-buy-loans-are-great-value" target="_self">https://kevinrosscox.me/2016/06/03/why-rent-and-buy-loans-are-great-value</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Money created with rent and buy loans is zero cost, but it has the value of the
property to which it refers.
</p><p>
Money created with regular loans has a value <span   class="emphasis"><em>independent</em></span> of the asset to which it
refers. That is, the money itself has a value. If we remove the cost of money, then we
reduce the cost of creating and administering loans. These reductions in cost are
passed on to renter/buyers and saver/lenders.
</p><p>
There are many costs incurred making sure people do not create money without the
backing of an asset. Unfortunately this has become difficult with the invention of
derivatives and other financial instruments.
</p><p>
The world is now awash in money because too much has been created. This happened
because we can back the creation of money with other money. If the underlying asset of
this pyramid fails, then everything above fails. The underlying assets are affected
because they are tightly connected to the failed loans.
</p><p>
Rent and buy loans are not connected tightly to any pyramid. This means if the money
pyramid fails it does not affect rent and buy loans. Rent and buy loans use
distributed systems to connect renters (buyers) directly to savers (lenders) without
an intermediary (banks) who create another layer of cost in order to benefit from the
previously difficult task of aggregating funds from savers and packaging those funds
in order to re-sell them to borrowers and taking a fat cut along the way. Think of
rent and buy loan platforms as a method for neutral connection of autonomous
buyer/renters and lender/savers without any data extraction.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Personal data in Kevin's system isn't an issue because:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Applications don't &ldquo;own the
data&rdquo;. Uber could be an application built on top of this. But anyone could also write
another Uber because they would have access to any data individuals allow. Ownership
of the data always remains with the entities, including individuals. Entities give
permissions to applications. The applications access the data. This is much cheaper
than applications restricting access to data.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
No, I don't fully understand it either. But I also didn't fully understand
free software (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html" target="_self">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html</a>) and the GPL
(<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html" target="_self">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html</a>) when I first encountered
them, even though I knew in my gut that the world needed them.
</p><p>
I didn't understand them because there were too few examples of them at
the time (the late 1980s and early 1990s), and because I was busy doing
stuff like helping Sun Microsystems succeed with SPARC and trying to
make network parts builders work together in compatible ways while the
internet was still busy forbidding commercial activity (which didn't
end until 1995).
</p><p>
After Linux took off (as GPL'd free software), I could see clearly how freedom worked
because the means were there&mdash;not just for demonstrating it to everybody, but for
developing more and more with it. I suspect the same could be true for promise-based
financial dealings such as rent and buy.
</p><p>
So my request here is to help Kevin debug the case he makes for his ideas, while
putting them to work.
</p><p>
It helps also to remember the introduction of Linux as a mutation that not only proved
free software could work in the world, but utterly changed the norms of software
development, liberating vast amounts of development labor from the feudal castles of
corporations and governments, while creating far more development opportunity along
the way&mdash;so much that today there's a worldwide shortage of programmers.
</p><p>
It also helps to have a big hairy enemy. The world's broken financial system is an
ideal candidate. So let's do for the world's economy what we did for its software.
