Find out how to make Qubes even more secure with a few advanced
features.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a27580.0x1b1f3b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This article is the fourth in my series about the Qubes operating system,
a security-focused Linux distribution that compartmentalizes your common
desktop tasks into individual VMs. In the previous articles, I gave a
general introduction to Qubes, walked through the installation process
and discussed how I personally organize my own work into different
appVMs. If you haven't read these earlier articles, I suggest you
do so before diving in here. In this article, I
focus on some of the more advanced security features in Qubes, including
split-GPG, the usbVM and how I control where URLs open.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a27580.0x1b1f568"></a>
Split GPG</h2></div></div><p>
One of the concerns I've always had with my Linux desktop was with the
fact that I had a copy of my GPG key on the desktop so I could use it for
my email. Of course, my key was password-protected, but I still worried
that if my computer ever were compromised, an attacker still could grab
it and try to brute-force it.
</p><p>
You can use a number of different techniques to protect GPG
keys, including methods that store the master key offline in an air-gapped
system while you use subordinate keys. Qubes offers a pretty novel
approach to GPG key security with its split GPG system that acts
kind of like a poor man's Hardware Security Module. With split GPG,
you store your GPG key in a highly trusted appVM, such as the vault VM
Qubes installs by default. The vault has no network card at all and is
designed to store sensitive files like GPG keys. When an application
wants to access the GPG key to encrypt or decrypt a file, instead of
calling GPG directly, it calls a wrapper script that is included in
the Qubes default templates. This script asks for permission to access
the vault GPG key for a limited amount of time (which means you get an
unspoofable prompt on your desktop from the vault), and if you grant it
permission, it will send the GPG input (data to encrypt or decrypt, for
instance) to the vault. The vault then will perform the GPG operation
and send the output back to the appVM. In this way, the key always stays
within the vault, and the appVM never sees it.
</p><p>
Split GPG is relatively simple to set up with the main challenge being
that because it relies on a wrapper script, any application that calls out
to GPG will need to be changed to point to a script like qubes-gpg-client
or qubes-gpg-client-wrapper (the former works on the command line, which
preserves environment variables, and the latter works better in programs
that don't preserve them well, like email clients). Qubes has great
documentation on split GPG on its website that includes some diagrams,
detailed explanations of how it works and its limitations, and a how-to
guide with sample configs for Thunderbird and Mutt.
</p><p>
The first step is to make sure that the qubes-gpg-split package is
installed in your appVMs (you should be able to use your regular package
manager to install it if it isn't) and that qubes-gpg-split-dom0 is
installed in dom0 (if not run <tt  >sudo qubes-dom0-update
qubes-gpg-split-dom0</tt>
in a dom0 terminal).
</p><p>
Once the software is installed, put your GPG keyring into the appVM you
want to use as your vault. I recommend the default vault unless you have
more advanced and specific reasons you want to use another appVM. Execute
some GPG command-line commands from a terminal in the vault (such as
<tt  >gpg -K</tt>) to confirm that the GPG key is installed correctly.
</p><p>
Now to use split GPG, just set the <tt  >QUBES_GPG_DOMAIN</tt> environment variable
to the name of the appVM that has your GPG key, and then you should
be able to run qubes-gpg-client from that appVM with the same kind
of arguments you normally would pass GPG. For applications like mail
clients that may not be able to load that environment variable, you must
use qubes-gpg-client-wrapper instead. This script is configured to read
the contents of the /rw/config/gpg-split-domain file to determine which
appVM to use, so be sure it contains the name of your vault:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo bash -c 'echo vault &gt; /rw/config/gpg-split-domain'
</pre>
</p><p>
That's pretty much it for basic GPG usage. The one major use case it
doesn't cover is importing keys from an appVM back to the vault. You want
to import keys in a trusted way, so Qubes provides a different script
for this purpose that will prompt you from the vault in an unspoofable
window before it imports the key. To import a key, just use this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ export QUBES_GPG_DOMAIN=vault
$ qubes-gpg-import-key somekey.asc
</pre>
</p><p>
That should be enough to get you started with split GPG, but if you
need particular split GPG configuration examples for applications like
Thunderbird, Mutt, and Git, I recommend checking out the Qubes split
GPG documentation page at <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/split-gpg" target="_self">https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/split-gpg</a>.

USB VM</h2></div></div><p>
One of the major risks of compromise against a personal computer is
the USB port. You can find a large number of stories on the internet
about organizations (including governments) who were compromised because
someone plugged in an untrusted USB key. There are even some fun hardware
projects out there like the USB Rubber Ducky that provide what looks
like an innocent USB thumbdrive but can act like a USB input device
when you plug it in, and with its scripting language, you can program it
to type whatever compromising keystrokes you want against your victim
(including waiting some time later before unleashing your payload).
</p><p>
Given that just about anyone can create a malicious USB device now, you
definitely want to be careful about what USB devices you plug in. Even
Qubes installs may suffer the same risk, because by default, the dom0 VM is
assigned the USB PCI controllers, so if you mistakenly plug in an infected
USB key, it could potentially compromise your whole machine. Thankfully,
Qubes provides a countermeasure for this with the option of creating a
special USB VM that is assigned all of your USB PCI devices. With the
USB VM in place, if an attacker plugs a malicious USB device in to your
computer while you are away (or you plug it in yourself), the damage is
contained to the USB VM.
</p><p>
Of course, if all of your USB devices are now assigned strictly to one
VM, how can you use them on your other appVMs? For input devices like
mice and keyboards, Qubes provides an input proxy service that will proxy
input devices to the rest of the appVMs provided the user accept a prompt
when the devices are plugged in. When you plug in a USB storage device,
it shows up only in the USB VM for starters, and you then can assign it
to other appVMs in the Qubes VM Manager by right-clicking on the appVM
and selecting the device from the attach/detach block devices menu (be
sure to detach it before you unplug it, otherwise Xen has been known
to get confused about the state of the block device).
</p><p>
If you do want to enable the USB VM, the sys-usb USB VM shows up as an
option during the install on the screen where you select which default
appVMs to load. Otherwise, if you want to try it out post-install, you
can run the following commands from the dom0 VM (Qubes 3.1 or newer):

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ qubesctl top.enable qvm.sys-usb
$ qubesctl state.highstate
</pre>
</p><p>
These commands will run through an automated Salt script the Qubes team
has put together that will configure the sys-usb VM appropriately. Of
course, if you want to do this all by hand, you also could just create your
own sysVM (I recommend not giving it a network card if you can help it),
and in the Qubes VM Manager, go into that VM's settings and identify and
assign your PCI USB controllers to it.
</p><p>
Now, there's a reason that sys-usb is disabled by default in the
installer. Although desktop computers still offer PS/2 ports and many laptops
use PS/2 as the interface for their main keyboard and mouse, some laptops
(such as current MacBooks for instance) use a USB interface for the main
keyboard. If that's the case, you can end up with a situation where you are
locked out of your computer, because your USB keyboard will be assigned to
your USB VM at boot, and you won't be able to log in. Another downside is
that although there are services to share input devices and storage devices
with other appVMs, any other USB devices (such as webcams or network
cards) cannot be shared and can be used only from applications within
the USB VM. Finally, the USB VM is unstable on some kinds of hardware,
depending on how well it supports Qubes.
</p><p>
By default, only mice are allowed through the Qubes input proxy (and
then only if you accept a prompt). Keyboards are not allowed through
by default, because of the extra risk a malicious keyboard input device
can pose to a system, including the fact that the USB VM can then read
anything you type on that keyboard in other appVMs (such as passwords)
or could enter its own keystrokes. If you are willing to accept this
risk, you still can provide a level of protection by ensuring that
you are prompted before an arbitrary USB keyboard is shared with the
rest of the environment. In a dom0 terminal, add the following line to
/etc/qubes-rpc/policy/qubes.InputKeyboard:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sys-usb dom0 ask
</pre>
</p><p>
In this case, I specified sys-usb, but if you use a different appVM as
your USB VM, use its name here instead.
</p><p>
The one big challenge you may find if you use a USB VM is in video
conferences. Since basically every webcam shows up as a USB device,
and there currently is no way to share that USB device with other VMs,
you are stuck using your webcam with apps in the USB VM only. A further
challenge is that, by default, the sys-usb VM has no network access, and
because it's a system VM type, you can't just point it to your sys-net VM
to grant it network access. Instead, if you want to video conference
with a USB VM, you unfortunately must replace the existing sys-usb VM
with a new one that is either an appVM or proxyVM so it can get network
access. Then you will have to install and run your video conferencing
software from within that VM.
</p><p>
The major downside to this approach is that the USB VM is traditionally
considered an untrusted VM much like sys-net, yet video conferencing
is a somewhat trusted application, because you have to provide login
credentials. Whether the security risk is worth the benefit is
something you will have to decide for yourself based on your
threat model. Fortunately in the future, there is hope that once a new
USB virtualization feature hits Xen (and Qubes), you may be able to treat
webcams like input or storage devices within Qubes.

URL Handlers</h2></div></div><p>
One final enhancement you can make with your Qubes desktop that not
only helps with security but also ease of use is the Qubes CLI
tools to open URLs in different appVMs. One common use case for this
is to configure your email client to open attachments in a disposable
VM (something Qubes covers for mail clients like Mutt on its main
documentation page). In addition to that, I like to set the default
URL handler for appVMs that aren't meant to run a web browser to be my
general-purpose untrusted appVM. The untrusted appVM has no personal
files or anything really of value to me on it, and I don't enter any login
credentials into that appVM. Therefore, I can destroy it and re-create
it at any time.
</p><p>
The default URL handler is a setting that you have to make in each
appVM. The way I set it is to go to the shortcuts editor for that appVM
(by clicking the &ldquo;add more shortcuts...&rdquo; option in that
appVM's desktop
menu) and adding the Preferred Applications program to that appVM's
shortcuts. This is the same program that you use on a regular desktop to
choose Firefox or Chrome as your default web browser. Once I've added
the shortcut, I then launch the program, and in the section where I can
set the web browser (Figure 1), I choose Other so I can type in my own
custom command, and in that field, I type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
qvm-open-in-vm untrusted "%s"
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12050f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Changing the Default URL Handler
</p></div></div><p>
Once I save that, the next time I click on a URL within that appVM (for
instance, in a chat session), I will get a prompt from the untrusted appVM
to allow this appVM to open a URL there. You either can allow that every
time or select &ldquo;Yes to All&rdquo; to allow this appVM to open
URLs in untrusted without prompting permanently. I use a similar method to open URLs
from my KeePassX password manager in my personal-web appVM instead of
untrusted by going into the KeePassX settings and configuring a custom
URL handler there instead. If you would rather open URLs in a disposable VM, just change this command to be:

<pre     class="programlisting">
qvm-open-in-dvm "%s"
</pre>
</p><p>
Although Qubes definitely is very secure by default, these additional
settings will help you lock it down even further, and each one gives
a prime example of how the principle of compartmentalization can help
you isolate and protect your computer. This is the last
article I intend to write in this Qubes series for now; however, I likely will come
back to more specific Qubes how-tos in the future.
