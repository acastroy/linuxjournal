Still using Python 2? Unable to upgrade? Try an incremental approach.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f2f580.0x20273b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The Python language, which is not new but continues to gain momentum
and users as if it were, has changed remarkably little since it 
first was released. I don't mean to say that Python hasn't changed; it
has grown, gaining functionality and speed, and it's now a hot
language in a variety of domains, from data science to test automation
to education. But, those who last used Python 15 or 20 years ago
would feel that the latest versions of the language are a natural
extension and evolution of what they already know.
</p><p>
At the same time, changes to the language&mdash;and particularly changes
made in Python 3.x&mdash;mean that Python 2 programs won't run unmodified
in Python 3. This is a known issue, and it was part of the process that
Python's BDFL (Benevolent Dictator for Life) Guido van Rossum
announced back when the &ldquo;Python 3000&rdquo; project was launched years ago.
Guido expected it would take time for organizations to move from
Python 2 to Python 3, but he also felt that the improvements to the
language were necessary.
</p><p>
The good news is that Python 3, which at the time of this writing exists in
version 3.5, is indeed better than Python 2. The bad news is that
there still are a lot of companies (including many of my training
and consulting clients) that still use Python 2.
</p><p>
Why don't they just upgrade? For the most part, it's because the time and
effort needed to do so aren't seen as a worthwhile investment of
developer resources. Most differences between Python 2 and 3 are easily
expressed and understood by people, but the upgrades aren't completely
automatic. Moving a large code base from Python 2 to 3 might take
days, but it also might take weeks or months.
</p><p>
That said, companies will soon be forced to upgrade, because as of the
year 2020, there will be no more support for Python 2. That's a risk
many companies aren't going to want to take.
</p><p>
If you have to upgrade, but can't upgrade, that puts you in a
terrible spot. However, there is another option: upgrade
incrementally, modifying just 1&ndash;2 files each week so that they work
with both Python 2 and 3. After a number of months of such
incremental changes, you'll be able to switch completely to Python 3
with relatively little investment.
</p><p>
How can you make your code compatible with both? In this article, I
provide a number of suggestions on how to do this, using both an
understanding of Python 3's changes and the tools that have been
developed to make this transition easier. Don't wait until 2019 to
start making these changes; if you're a Python developer, you
already (in mid-2016) should be thinking about how to change your code
to be Python 3-compatible.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f2f580.0x2027828"></a>
What Has Changed?</h2></div></div><p>
The first thing to ask is this: what exactly changed in Python 3? And, how easily
can you move from Python 2 to Python 3? Or, how can you modify your
Python 2 programs so they'll continue to work in Python 2, but
then also work unmodified in Python 3? This last question is probably
the most important one for my clients, and possibly for your business as well,
during this transition period.
</p><p>
On the face of things, not very much actually changed in Python 3.
It's a cleaner, more efficient and modern language that works like more
modern Python developers want and expect. Things that Python
developers were doing for years, but that weren't defaults in the
language, are now indeed defaults. Sure, there are things I'm
still getting used to after years of bad habits, such as failing to
use parentheses around the arguments passed to <tt  >print</tt>, but on the
whole, the language has stayed the same.
</p><p>
However, this doesn't mean that nothing has changed or that you can
get away with not changing your code.
</p><p>
For example, you almost certainly never wanted to use Python 2's
<tt  >input</tt> built-in function to get user input. Rather, you wanted to
use the <tt  >raw_input</tt> built-in function. So in Python 3, there is no
equivalent to Python 2's <tt  >input</tt>; the Python 3
<tt  >input</tt> function is
the same as Python 2's <tt  >raw_input</tt>.
</p><p>
A more profound change is the switch in the behavior of strings. No
longer do strings contain bytes; now they contain Unicode characters,
encoded using UTF-8. If 100% of your work uses ASCII, you're in
luck; nothing in your programs will really need to change. But if you
use non-ASCII characters, and if you do so in the same program as you
work with the contents of binary files, you'll have to make some
adjustments. Python 2's <tt  >str</tt> class is now a
<tt  >bytes</tt> class, and
Python 2's <tt  >unicode</tt> class is now the <tt  >str</tt> class.
</p><p>
A number of other changes have been made that make Python more
efficient. For example, Python 2 has the <tt  >range</tt> function (which
returns a list of integers) and the <tt  >xrange</tt> function (which returns
an iterator). Python 3's <tt  >range</tt> function is the same as Python 2's
<tt  >xrange</tt>, because it's so much more efficient, and there really are few
reasons to prefer the old <tt  >range</tt>. But if your program expects
to get a list back from <tt  >range</tt>, you might be in trouble when you move
to Python 3.
</p><p>
Another problem, which has become far less acute in the last year or
two, is that of third-party libraries. If you're using packages from
PyPI, you need to make sure not only that your own code works
with Python 3, but also that all of those packages do. For a long
time, I would argue that these packages were the bottleneck stopping
many people from upgrading. But nowadays, most popular packages
support Python 3, as you can see at <a href="http://py3readiness.org" target="_self">py3readiness.org</a>, which
tracks such information.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f2f580.0x2028170"></a>
Identifying Problems</h2></div></div><p>
So, how can you take a Python 2 program and modify it so that it'll
work under both Python 2 and 3? You could go through the code line
by line and try to find changes, but there are tools that can make
the process much easier.
</p><p>
The first is an old friend of Python developers, the <tt  >pylint</tt> program,
which normally checks your code for Python style and usage. Modern
versions of <tt  >pylint</tt> have a <tt  >py3k</tt> option
you can apply that
checks your code to see how compatible it is with Python 3. For
example, let's assume you have written the (terrible) program shown in
Listing 1. How can you find out which parts of it aren't going to
work? You can run this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pylint --py3k oldstuff.py
</pre>
</p><p>
And, you'll get the following output:

<pre     class="programlisting">
************* Module oldstuff
W:  3, 7: raw_input built-in referenced (raw_input-builtin)
E:  4, 0: print statement used (print-statement)
E:  5, 0: print statement used (print-statement)
E:  6, 0: print statement used (print-statement)
W:  8, 9: raw_input built-in referenced (raw_input-builtin)
E: 10, 4: print statement used (print-statement)
W: 10,48: division w/o __future__ statement (old-division)
E: 14, 4: print statement used (print-statement)
W: 16, 4: range built-in referenced when not iterating
 &#8618;(range-builtin-not-iterating)
E: 17, 0: print statement used (print-statement)
</pre>
</p><p>
The output contains both errors (&ldquo;E&rdquo;) and warnings (&ldquo;W&rdquo;).
The example program is using
<tt  >print</tt> as a statement, rather than a function. It's using
<tt  >range</tt>
when not iterating. And, it's using <tt  >raw_input</tt>. What can you do
about it, and how can you improve things? <tt  >pylint</tt> won't tell
you; that's
not its job. But if nothing else, you now have a list of things to fix
and improve, so that it'll at least run under Python 3.

    print i

If you have written a Python package with a requirements file, you can
download and install <tt  >caniusepython3</tt> from PyPI. Running
<tt  >caniusepython3</tt> against your requirements file will indicate what will
work and what won't. If you don't want to download and install
<tt  >caniusepython3</tt>, you actually can go to 
<a href="http://caniusepython3.com" target="_self">caniusepython3.com</a> and upload your requirements file there.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f2f580.0x2028b10"></a>
Fixing Problems</h2></div></div><p>
Python has come with a program called <tt  >2to3</tt> for some time that
looks over your Python 2 code and tries to find ways to make it work
with Python 3. So, you can run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
2to3 oldstuff.py
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f2f580.0x2028cc8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and get unified diff-style output, indicating what changes you'll need
to make in order for your program to work under Python 3. The problem
is that this is a one-way conversion. It tells you how to change your
program so it'll work with Python 3, but it doesn't help you make your program
compatible with both 2 and 3 simultaneously.
</p><p>
Fortunately, there's a package on PyPI called <tt  >futurize</tt> that not
only runs <tt  >2to3</tt>, but also provides the import statements necessary for your
code to run under both versions. You can just run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
futurize oldstuff.py
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f2f580.0x201f7c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and the output is (as with <tt  >2to3</tt>) in diff format, so you
can use it
either to create a file that's compatible with both or to read through
things.
</p><p>
What if you have Python 3 code and want to make it backward-compatible with Python 2?
The same people who make <tt  >futurize</tt> also
make the amusingly named <tt  >pasteurize</tt>, which inserts the appropriate
<tt  >import</tt> statements into code.
</p><p>
How do you know if your code really works well under both Python 2 and
3 after you have applied futurize's changes? You can't, and there is
no doubt that these automatic tools will get some things wrong. For
this reason (among others), it's crucial that you have a good test
suite, with good coverage of your Python 2 code. Then you can run
your tests against the Python 3 version and ensure that it works
correctly there as well. Without these tests, you shouldn't think
that your upgrade has worked; even 100% test coverage is never a
guarantee, but it at least can tell you that the risk of failure has
been minimized.
</p><p>
What if you're doing all sorts of serious and deep things with Python
2 that <tt  >2to3</tt> can't notice, or that you can't paper
over? A great
package on PyPI is <tt  >six</tt>, which papers over the differences between
Python 2 and 3. For example, let's say you want to create a new
object of the type used for text, such that things will be compatible
across versions. In Python 2, that's going to be <tt  >unicode</tt>, but in
Python 3, that's going to be <tt  >str</tt>. You don't want to have an
&ldquo;if&rdquo;
statement in your code each time you do this. Thus, using <tt  >six</tt>, you can
say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
import six
s = six.text_type()
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you can be sure that &ldquo;s&rdquo; is an object of the appropriate type.
</p><p>
<tt  >six</tt> defines an amazing array of things that have changed, which you
might need to keep track of in your code. Want to check something in
the <tt  >builtins</tt> namespace (aka
<tt  >__builtins__</tt> in Python 2)? Want to
re-raise exceptions? Want to use StringIO (or BytesIO)? Want to deal
with metaclasses? Using <tt  >six</tt>, you can write a single line of code,
which behind the scenes will issue the appropriate &ldquo;if&rdquo; statements for
the version of Python you're using.
</p><p>
Even if you don't use <tt  >six</tt> in your code, I recommend that you read
through its documentation just to see where things have changed in
Python 3. It'll open your eyes (as it did to mine) regarding the
behind-the-scenes changes that often aren't discussed in the Python
2/3 world, and it might give you more insights into how to write your
code so that it can work in both.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
If you're starting to write some new Python code today, you should use
Python 3. And if you have Python 2 code that you can upgrade to
Python 3, you should do that as well. But if you're like most
companies with an existing Python 2 code base, your best option
might well be to upgrade incrementally, which means having code that
works under 2 and 3 simultaneously. Once you've converted all of your
code, and it passes tests under both 2 and 3, you can flip the switch,
joining the world of Python 3 and all of its goodness.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f2f580.0x2020268"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Resources</b></p><p>
Much has been written about the changes in Python 2 and 3. A great
collection of such information is at the <a href="http://python-future.org" target="_self">python-future.org</a> website.
That site offers the <tt  >futurize</tt> and
<tt  >pasteurize</tt> packages as well as a
great deal of documentation describing the changes between versions,
techniques for upgrading and things to watch out for.
</p><p>
The <tt  >six</tt> package is documented at <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/six" target="_self">https://pythonhosted.org/six</a>. Even
if you don't use <tt  >six</tt> for 2/3 compatibility, I strongly suggest
that you look through its capabilities. 
</p><p>
Finally, if you're a web developer using Django, you 
definitely should read the Django-specific documentation regarding moving to
Python 3 at
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/python3" target="_self">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/python3</a>.
</p><p>
This is especially important because of Django's handling of strings,
bytes and Unicode strings, the names of which changed a bit over the
years. Django actually includes a copy of the <tt  >six</tt> library, modified
slightly to suit its needs for internal use.
