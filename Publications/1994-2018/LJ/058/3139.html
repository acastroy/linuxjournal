    What is GNOME and where is it heading? Miguel tells us all.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb2b580.0xc233a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>GNOME is an acronym for GNU's Network
Object Model Environment. GNOME addresses a number of issues that
have not previously been addressed in the UNIX world, such as:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Providing a consistent user interface.</p></li><li><p>Providing user-friendly tools and making them
powerful by leveraging the UNIX foundation.</p></li><li><p>Creating a UNIX standard for component programming
and component reuse.</p></li><li><p>Providing a consistent mechanism for
printing.</p></li></ul></div>

GNOME's main objective is to provide a user-friendly suite of
applications and an easy-to-use desktop. As with most GNU programs,
GNOME has been designed to run on almost all strains of UNIX-like
operating systems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb2b580.0xc237c0"></a>History of GNOME</h2></div></div><p>The GNU GNOME project was initially announced in August 1997.
After just one year of development, approximately two hundred
programmers worldwide are now involved in the project.</p><p>The original announcement called for developers to shape the
GNOME project in a number of forums: the GNU announce mailing
lists; the Guile mailing list; and the GTK+ and GIMP mailing lists.
The programmers and other people who influenced the project were
mainly free software enthusiasts with diverse areas of expertise,
including graphics programming and language design.</p><p>The GNOME team has been working steadily toward creating a
foundation for future free software development. GNOME provides the
toolkit and reusable component set to build the free software end
users are eager for.</p><p>Our recent releases of the GNU Network Object Model
Environment have been GNOME 0.20, the first version of GNOME that
showed signs of integrations, released in May 1998; the Drooling
Macaque 0.25 release, with more features; and finally, our latest
public release, GNOME 0.30, codenamed Bouncing Bonobo.</p><p>The GNOME 0.20 release was the first release included in a
CD-ROM distribution. Red Hat 5.1 shipped with a technology preview
of the GNOME desktop environment and it was first demonstrated at
the 1998 Linux Expo in North Carolina.</p><p>Before the Drooling Macaque release, GNOME software releases
were coordinated by two or three people on the team. This became a
significant burden, as precious time was being used coordinating
each release. We have been trying to make the release process more
modular and have assigned different modules to package maintainers.
Each package maintainer is responsible for packing, testing and
releasing their packages independently of the main distribution,
which we consider to be the core libraries and the core desktop
applications. So far we have had some success, but there is still
room for improvement. We will continue to polish the release
process to make it simpler.</p><p><a href="3139f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure
1</b></span></a></p><p><a href="3139f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure
2</b></span></a></p><p>The most recent GNOME release, Bouncing Bonobo, is the first
to feature the GNOME spreadsheet Gnumeric.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb2b580.0xc23ce8"></a>Red Hat Advanced Development Labs</h2></div></div><p>In January 1998, Red Hat announced the creation of the Red
Hat Advanced Development Laboratories (RHAD). The initial objective
of Red Hat Labs was to help the GNOME effort by providing code and
programmers and by helping us manage the project resources.</p><p>All code contributed to GNOME by Red Hat Advanced
Laboratories has been provided under the terms of the GNU GPL and
the GNU LGPL licenses. Several GTK+ and GNOME developers have been
hired by Red Hat and they have rapidly provided the GNOME project
with a number of important features.</p><p>For example, Rasterman has implemented themes for GTK+; the
GTK+ themes allow a user to change the appearance of the widgets.
This is done by abstracting the widget drawing routines from the
toolkit and putting those drawing routines in modules that can be
loaded at runtime. Thus, the user can change the appearance of
applications without shutting them down or restarting the
desktop.</p><p><a href="3139f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure
3</b></span></a></p><p>GTK+ themes are fully working. So far, a number of theme
front-ends have been written. At the time of this writing,
available themes include Motif, Windows95, Metal, native-GTK+ and a
general purpose Bitmap-based engine (see Resources). The web site
http://gtk.themes.org/ keeps an up-to-date list with many
contributed themes from which to choose.</p><p>Various important changes to the GTK+ toolkit required for
the GNOME project, such as the menu keyboard navigation code and
the enhanced &ldquo;Drag and Drop&rdquo; protocols (XDND and Motif DND), were
written by Owen Taylor, a famous GTK+ hacker now working for Red
Hat Labs.</p><p>Assorted applications were created or are maintained nowadays
by the GNOME team at RHAD as well: the Ghostscript front end (by
Jonathan Blandford), the GNOME Help Browser and the GNOME RPM
interface (Marc Ewing and Michael Fullbright), the GNOME Calendar
and GNOME Canvas (Federico Mena) and the ORBit CORBA 2.2
implementation (Elliot Lee).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb2b580.0xc240b0"></a>Other Donations</h2></div></div><p>The GNOME project received a monetary donation from the
GNU/Linux Debian team in the early stages of the project, as well
as an Alpha board from Quant-X Service and Consulting GmbH. We are
very grateful for their contributions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb2b580.0xc241b8"></a>Some Key GNOME Features</h2></div></div><p>The GNOME libraries provide a framework to create consistent
applications and to simplify the programmer's task. More features
of the GNOME libraries will be described later. Some of the most
important current developments in the GNOME libraries are discussed
here.</p><p>Metadata</p><p>One problem faced in a desktop environment is the fact that
it is usually necessary to have a mechanism for storing information
about a file's properties. For example, applications might want to
bind an icon for a specific executable file, or bind a small
thumbnail image for a graphic produced by a graphics program. These
icons should be semantically attached to the main file.</p><p>The Macintosh OS, for example, provides a way to store this
information in the file as its &ldquo;resource fork&rdquo;. This mechanism
would be awkward at best to implement in a UNIX environment. The
main problem is that a non-metadata-aware application can cause the
metadata information to get out of sync.</p><p>The GNOME metadata was implemented by Tom Tromey at Cygnus,
given a number of design constraints and tradeoffs (described in
detail on their web site). The following is a list of the GNOME
metadata features:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Binding the information on a per-file basis in a
per-user setting, and each user keeps track of his own bindings.
System defaults apply on top of these.</p></li><li><p>Binding information by file content is done
according to the file type using file signatures, similar to the
UNIX <span   class="bold"><b>file</b></span> command.</p></li><li><p>Binding information by a regular expression: for
example, a default icon for gif files would be provided by the
regular expression <b  >.*\.gif$</b>.</p></li><li><p>The metadata system is optimized to provide a
coherent GUI solution, rather than as a compromise or kludge to
existing command-line tools.</p></li><li><p>Most ordinary uses of files will continue to work
without metadata, just as they do now.</p></li></ol></div><p>A number of standard properties for file metadata are
available in GNOME. For example, &ldquo;View&rdquo; stores the action for
viewing the file contents; &ldquo;Open&rdquo; stores analogous action for
editing; &ldquo;Icon&rdquo;, which contains the icon, is used for displaying
the file on the desktop.
</p><p>Metadata types are MIME types.</p><p>Canvas</p><p>GNOME provides a <span   class="bold"><b>Canvas</b></span>
widget, patterned after Tk's excellent canvas. This widget
simplifies the programming of applications that need control over
graphical components. The most noticeable feature of GNOME Canvas
is that it provides a flicker-free drawing area where high-level
objects can be inserted and manipulated. Basic zoom and scroll
facilities are also a part of the canvas.</p><p><a href="3139f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure
4</b></span></a></p><p>The high-level objects inserted into the canvas behave like
regular widgets. They can receive X events, grab the focus and grab
the mouse just like a regular widget. As with their Tk
counterparts, GNOME Canvas items can have their properties changed
at runtime with a Tk-like configuration mechanism.</p><p>The GNOME Canvas ships with a number of items derived from
the <b  >GnomeCanvasItem</b> object: lines, rectangles,
ellipses, arrows, polylines and a generic widget container to embed
GTK+ widgets within a canvas. The Canvas framework is designed to
be very extensible. As proof of this extensibility, the GNOME
spreadsheet is implemented on top of the base canvas engine, with
additional functionality provided by spreadsheet-specific
<b  >CanvasItems</b>.</p><p>Note that the current Canvas uses Gdk primitives (a thin
wrapper over Xlib primitives) to draw, so it is limited in the
quality and range of special effects that can be provided with it,
which bring us to the next step in Canvas technology.</p><p>Raph Levien is working on an advanced rendering engine for
the Canvas. It was originally developed as a stand-alone widget
within his Type1 outline font editor,
<span   class="bold"><b>gfonted</b></span>. At the time of this
writing, work on integrating the engine into the Canvas was getting
underway.</p><p>Features of this engine include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Anti-aliased rendering of all items</p></li><li><p>Alpha transparency</p></li><li><p>Items for vector and bezier paths</p></li><li><p>Items for RGB and RGB plus alpha images</p></li><li><p>Vector operations, including clip (intersect),
union, difference and stroke layout</p></li><li><p>PostScript Type1 font loading and rendering</p></li></ul></div><p>The engine's design goal is to support almost all of the
PostScript imaging model with the addition of alpha transparency.
As such, it is expected to be an excellent starting point for
high-powered graphics applications.
</p><p>In spite of the ambitious goal of keeping the display up to
date with entirely anti-aliased and alpha-composited items,
performance is surprisingly good&mdash;comparable, in fact, to the
Xlib-primitive-based canvas engine.</p><p>His code is expected to be merged into the main Canvas
sometime soon.</p><p>Window Manager Independence</p><p>GNOME does not depend on a special window manager&mdash;any
existing window manager will do. GNOME specifies window manager
hints that can be implemented by the window manager to give the
user better desktop integration, but they are optional. The E
window manager implements all of the GNOME window manager hints and
can be used as a reference implementation for people wishing to
extend their window managers to be GNOME-compliant. The ICEWM
manager is tracking those developments and is also considered to be
a GNOME-compliant window manager, although at this time, it is
lagging a bit behind. A few people have shown interest in providing
the WindowMaker and FVWM2 maintainers with patches to make those
window managers GNOME-aware.</p><p>Component Programming</p><p>Historically, one of the attractions of UNIX has been the
philosophy of small tools that each do one thing well and combining
these tools, using pipes and simple shell scripts, to perform more
complex tasks. This philosophy works very well when data objects
are represented as plaintext and operations are effectively
filters. However, this UNIX command-line philosophy does not scale
well to today's world of multimedia objects.</p><p>Thus, it would be nice to have a framework in GNOME that
would provide software reuse and component plugging and
interaction, i.e., connecting small specialized tools to carry out
complex tasks. With this infrastructure in place, GNOME
applications can once again return to the UNIX roots of simple,
well-specialized tools.</p><p>An RPC system was then required for providing this sort of
functionality, so we decided to use CORBA (the Common Object
Request Broker Architecture) from the Object Management Group
(OMG). CORBA can be thought of as an object-oriented RPC system,
which happens to have standardized bindings for different
languages.</p><p>CORBA opened a range of applications for us. Component
programming allowed us to package programs and shared libraries as
program servers that each implement a specific interface.</p><p>For example, the GNOME mail program, Balsa, implements the
<b  >GNOME::MailMessage</b> interface that enables any
CORBA-aware program to remotely compose and customize the contents
of a mail message and send it. Thus, it is possible to replace the
mail program with any program that implements the
<b  >GNOME::MailMessage</b> interface. As far as the
GNOME desktop is concerned, the process just implements the
<b  >GNOME::MailMessage</b> interface. This means, for
example, that I will be able to continue using GNUS to read my mail
and have GNUS completely integrated with the rest of my desktop.
This also applies to the other components in the GNOME system: the
address book, file manager, terminal emulation program, help
browser, office applications and more.</p><p>Beside providing the basic GNOME interfaces, applications can
provide an interface to their implementation-specific features.
This is done by using CORBA's interface inheritance. A specific
interface would be derived from the more general interface. For
example, GNUS would implement the
<b  >GNOME::MailMessage</b> interface and extend it with
GNUS-specific features in the
<b  >GNOME::GnusMailMessage</b> interface. This interface
would hypothetically allow the user to customize GNUS at the Lisp
level, something other mailers may not do. Another example would be
a <b  >GNOME::MozillaMailMessage</b> interface that would
let a user configure the HTML rendering engine in Mozilla
mail.</p><p>Not only does CORBA address these issues, but it can also be
used as a general interprocess communication engine. Instead of
inventing a new ad-hoc interprocess communication system each time
two programs need to communicate, a CORBA interface can be
used.</p><p>Embedding documents into other documents has been popularized
by Microsoft with their Object Linking and Embedding architecture.
A document-embedding model similar in spirit is being designed for
GNOME (the Baboon model), and all of the interprocess communication
in this model is defined in terms of CORBA interfaces.</p><p>Initially, we were very excited by the possibilities CORBA
presented us, but we soon realized that using CORBA in the GNOME
desktop was going to be more difficult than we expected.</p><p>We tried using Xerox's ILU for our CORBA needs. The license
at the time did not permit us to make modifications to the code and
redistribute them, an important thing for the free software
community, so we had to look for alternatives. Xerox has since
changed the licensing policy.</p><p>After evaluating various free CORBA implementations, we
settled on MICO, as it was the most feature-full free
implementation. MICO was designed as a teaching tool for CORBA,
with a primary focus on code clarity.</p><p>Unfortunately, we soon found that MICO was not a
production-quality tool suitable for the needs of GNOME. For one,
we found that the rather indiscriminate use of C++ templates (both
in MICO and in MICO-generated stubs) proved to be a resource hog.
Compiling bits of GNOME required as much as 48MB of RAM for even
the simplest uses of CORBA, and this was slowing down our
development. Another problem was that MICO supported only the C++
CORBA bindings. Even though an initial attempt had been made at
providing C bindings, they were incomplete and not
well-maintained.</p><p>To address these problems, Dick Porter at i2it and Elliot Lee
at Red Hat Labs wrote a C-based, thin and fast CORBA 2.2
implementation called ORBit. As soon as ORBit became stable, the
use of CORBA throughout GNOME began, after a delay of almost eight
months.</p><p>With an efficient, production quality CORBA implementation
under our control, we can ensure that CORBA-enabled interprocess
communication is a valuable service for application programmers,
rather than a source of overhead and bulk.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb2b580.0x101ddd0"></a>Dissecting a GNOME Desktop Application</h2></div></div><p>The toolkit</p><p>GNOME desktop applications have been built on top of the
object-oriented GTK+ toolkit originally designed as a GUI toolkit
for the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP).</p><p>GTK+ has been implemented on top of a simple window and
drawing API called Gdk (GTK Drawing Kit). The initial version of
Gdk was a fairly thin wrapper around the Xlib libraries, but a port
to Win32 and a port to the Y windowing system are presently in
alpha stages.</p><p>GTK+ implements an object system entirely in C. This object
system is quite rich in functionality, including classical single
inheritance, dynamic creation of new methods and classes, and a
&ldquo;signal&rdquo; mechanism for dynamically attaching handlers to the
various events that occur in the user interface. One of GTK's great
strengths is the availability of a wide range of language bindings,
including C++, Objective-C, Perl, Python, Scheme and Tom. These
language bindings provide access both to GTK+ objects and to new
objects programmed in the language of choice.</p><p>An additional feature of GNOME is Rasterman's Imlib library.
This library is implemented alongside Gdk and provides a fast yet
flexible interface for loading and saving images and rendering them
on the screen. Applications using Imlib have quick and direct
access to PNG, GIF, TIFF, JPEG and XPM files as well as other
formats available through external conversion filters.</p><p>The Support Libraries</p><p>C-based GNOME applications use the GLIB utility library. glib
provides the C programmer with a set of useful data structures:
linked lists, doubly linked lists, hash tables (one-to-one maps),
trees, string manipulation, memory-chunk reuse, debugging macros,
assertion and logging facilities. glib also includes a portable
interface for a dynamic module facility.</p><p>The GNOME libraries</p><p>The GNOME libraries add the missing pieces to the toolkit to
create full applications, dictate some policy, and help in the
process of providing consistent user interfaces as well as
localizing the GNOME applications so they can be used in various
countries.</p><p>The current GNOME libraries are GTK+-Xmhtml, gnome-print,
libgnome, libgnomeui, libgnorba, libgtop, gnome-dom and gnome-xml.
Other libraries are used for specific applications: libPropList
(soon to be replaced by a new configuration engine) and
audiofile.</p><p>The main non-graphical library is called libgnome. This
provides functions to keep track of recently used documents,
configuration information, metadata handling (see below), game
score functions and command-line argument handling. This library
does not depend on the use of a windowing system.</p><p>As we use CORBA to achieve parts of our desktop integration,
we have a special library called the libgnorba library to deal with
various CORBA issues. It provides GUI/CORBA integration (to let our
GUI applications act as servers), authentication within the GNOME
framework and service activation.</p><p>The gnomeui library, on the other hand, has the code that
requires a window system to run. It contains the following
components:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The GNOME session management support</p></li><li><p>Widgets, both as straightforward extensions of GTK+
and designed to be dependent on libgnome features</p></li><li><p>A set of standard dialog boxes otherwise not
available on GTK+, well-integrated with other GNOME
libraries</p></li><li><p>Standard property configuration dialog boxes</p></li><li><p>Standard top-level window handling</p></li><li><p>A multi-document interface (gnome-mdi)</p></li><li><p>Windowing hints</p></li><li><p>CORBA integration where required</p></li></ul></div><p>GTK+-XmHTML is a port of the Koen D'Hondt's XmHTML widget for
Motif and is used for our HTML display needs. Our changes are being
folded back into the main distribution.
</p><p>The lib gtop library allows system applications to be easily
ported to various operating systems; it provides system, process
and file system information.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>gnome-xml</b></span> provides XML file
loading, parsing and saving for GNOME applications and is being
used in the GNOME spreadsheet
(<span   class="bold"><b>Gnumeric</b></span>) and in the GNOME word
processor program. <span   class="bold"><b>gnome-dom</b></span>
provides an implementation of the World Wide Web Consortium's
Document Object Model for GNOME applications. By the time you read
this article, gnome-dom will have been deployed widely in the GNOME
office applications. Both gnome-xml and gnome-dom were developed by
Daniel Veillard from the World Wide Web Consortium.</p><p><a href="3139f5.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure
5</b></span></a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>gnome-print</b></span> implements
GNOME's printing architecture. It consists of a pluggable rendering
engine as well as a set of widgets and standard dialog boxes for
selecting and configuring printers. In addition, gnome-print is
responsible for managing outline fonts and contains scripts that
automatically find fonts already installed on the system.</p><p>The GNOME print imaging model is modeled after PostScript.
Basic operations include vector and bezier path construction,
stroking, filling, clipping, text (using Type1 fonts, with TrueType
to follow shortly) and images.</p><p>Currently, gnome-print generates only PostScript output.
However, the design of the imaging model is closely synchronized
with the anti-aliased rendering engine for the Canvas and it is
expected that these two modules will be interoperating soon. In
particular, it will be possible to &ldquo;print&rdquo; into a canvas (useful
for providing a high-quality screen preview) and to print the
contents of a canvas. This feature should simplify the design of
applications which use the Canvas, as very little extra code will
be needed to support printing.</p><p>The same rendering engine will be used to render printed
pages directly without going through a PostScript step. This path
is especially exciting for providing high-quality, high-performance
printing to color ink-jet printers, even of complex pages
containing transparency, gradients and other elements considered
&ldquo;tricky&rdquo; in the traditional PostScript imaging model.</p><p>Bindings</p><p>One explicit goal of GNOME was to support development in a
wide range of languages, because no single language is ideal for
every application. To this end, bindings for both GTK+ and the
GNOME libraries exist for many popular programming languages,
currently C, C++, Objective-C, Perl, Python, Scheme and Tom.</p><p>The early involvement of Scheme, Tom and Perl hackers in both
the GTK+ and GNOME projects has helped in making the GTK+ and GNOME
APIs easy to wrap up for various languages. Multi-language support
is &ldquo;baked in&rdquo; to the design of GTK+ and GNOME, rather than being
added on as an afterthought.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb2b580.0x101eea8"></a>Development model</h2></div></div><p>GNOME is developed by a loosely coupled team of programmers
around the world. Project coordination is done on the various GNOME
mailing lists.</p><p>The GNOME source code is kept on the GNOME CVS server
(cvs:cvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome/). Access to the source code through
Netscape's Bonsai and LXR tools is provided at
http://cvs.gnome.org/, to help programmers get acquainted with the
GNOME source code base.</p><p>Most developers who have contributed code, major bug fixes
and documentation to GNOME have CVS write access, fostering a very
open atmosphere. GNOME developers come from a wide range of
backgrounds and have diverse levels of skill and experience.
Contributions from less experienced people have been surprisingly
helpful, while the older, wiser coders have been happy to mentor
younger contributors on the team. The GNOME developer community
values clean, maintainable code. Even programmers with many years
of coding experience have noted how involvement with the GNOME
project has helped them write better code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb2b580.0x101f060"></a>The GNOME Office Suite Applications</h2></div></div><p>As the GNOME foundation libraries become more stable, the
development of larger programming projects has become possible and
has allowed small teams of developers to put together the
applications which will make up the GNOME office suite.</p><p>As with other GNOME components, the GNOME office suite is
currently catching up with commercial offerings. By providing an
office suite which is solid, fast and component-based, the code
written for the GNOME project might become the foundation for a new
era of free software program development.</p><p>The office suite leverages a lot of knowledge many of us have
acquired during the past year while developing various GNOME
components. Our coding standards are higher, the quality is better
and the code is more clean and more robust.</p><p>The availability of these applications has provided us with
the test bed we required to complete our document embedding
interfaces (the Baboon model).</p><p>Two word processing projects are going on for GNOME: one of
them is GWP by Seth Alves at the Hungry Programmers and the other
one is Go from Chris Lahey. GWP is currently more advanced and has
printing working with the GNOME printing architecture.</p><p>Gnumeric, the GNOME spreadsheet project, is aimed at
providing a commercial-quality spreadsheet with advanced features.
It provides a comfortable and powerful user interface. As with
other components in GNOME, we have worked toward providing a solid
and extensible framework for future development.</p><p>Recently, work has begun on Achtung, the GNOME presentations
program. It is still in the early stages of development.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb2b580.0xf2fc88"></a>Getting GNOME</h2></div></div><p>Tested source code releases of GNOME are available from
