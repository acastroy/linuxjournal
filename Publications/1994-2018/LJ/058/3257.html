    Mr. Rubini gives us his opinion of the Open Source movement.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdad580.0xea5348"></a></h2></div></div><p>Fortunately, Linus' project of world
domination is going to come true fairly soon. The trend toward this
goal can be verified by checking how the press is behaving towards
GNU/Linux solutions, looking at how several educational entities
are going to introduce free software in the schools and verifying
Linux's usual technical excellence.
</p><p>Today in 1998 (yes, it is still 1998 as I write), the most
important job remaining, in my opinion, is propagating the social
and commercial implications of free software. While I greatly
appreciated Russell Nelson's article &ldquo;Open Source Software Model&rdquo;
in the July issue of <i  >LJ</i>, I feel the need to
expand on the points he briefly touched.</p><p>Please note that I'm not an expert in economics or politics.
I'm just a build-it-yourself kind of technical guy who is reporting
his own experience in the battle for survival, in the hopes of
helping someone else adapt to new environmental conditions. Some of
these ideas have already been discussed with friends or on the Free
Software Business mailing list (fsb-subscribe@crynwr.com), which I
joined after reading Russell's article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdad580.0xea5558"></a>Viability for Individual Consultants</h2></div></div><p>The best feature of any computer system is flexibility--
allowing users to tailor its behaviour to their own needs. This
flexibility is often completely unknown to the general computer
user, because proprietary software solutions tend to hide
functionality behind a rigid external interface which denies any
divergence from the expected behaviour&mdash;a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>user's</em></span> behaviour.</p><p>When adopting free software, users are able to discover the
real power of computer systems. Today I talked with a commercial
consultant who never thought that programs could be adapted to
one's needs. He confessed his company has always acted the other
way around&mdash;they adapted their needs to the software they use. Most
users are victims of their software and don't even realize
it.</p><p>Educating the user base about the extendibility of software
will open new markets to independent consultants, creating new
employment opportunities. Every user has different needs and
solving these needs often means calling for technical support from
people who tailor or enhance the relevant software. While this is
not even imaginable with proprietary programs, source availability
allows any problem that might arise to be quickly solved and new
features to be easily added. While you may think this would quickly
lead to a <span   class="emphasis"><em>perfect</em></span> software package, individual
needs are so diverse and specialized that the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>perfect</em></span> package will never exist.</p><p>For example, I and others wrote a program for a local
physiology center to analyze data for a typical kind of experiment.
During two years of use, the physicians found so many ways to
enhance the program that it is now reported as better than the
commercial solutions. The total of all fees they paid during these
years reveals the program to be more expensive in the end than some
of the commercial alternatives. This fact is not relevant to my
clients, as they have exactly what they want and they know they can
have more should the need arise. The program is obviously GPL and
other centers expressed interest in getting a copy.</p><p>As more and more people are choosing free software to address
their needs, I'm sure some software companies will try to demonize
Linux and the open-source movement because they are losing market
share. Such companies will probably try to demonstrate that IT
employment is decreasing and that humankind is being damaged by the
general adoption of free software. This whole argument is bogus;
computers exist to be programmed, and the more you allow
programming them, the more you build employment opportunities. If
you count the number of people who offer free software consulting,
you will greatly exceed any shrinkage of proprietary companies.
Sticking to my previous example, the physiology lab hired my
company to write the program, and other centers interested in the
product are willing to hire a local consultant for installing,
maintaining and enhancing our package. Did I say &ldquo;enhance&rdquo;? Isn't
the program working? Yes, the program is working well, but there
<span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> room for enhancement of the product. The
local lab decided to stop development &ldquo;because we must run our
experiment rather than invent new software features&rdquo;. As anyone
knows, every program has a bug and a missing feature, and this is
where we build our credibility&mdash;bugs <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> be
fixed and features <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> be implemented. As I
suggested before, the more you make things programmable, the more
they will be programmed.</p><p>Why should there be more employment opportunities in IT than
there are now? First of all, because free software users have more
requests for new features than users of proprietary products do, as
explained above. Next, because anyone can build her own
professionalism without paying to access the sources of
information. I built my Linux expertise by studying source code and
trying things out on my own low-end PC. Now I am confident I can
solve any problem my clients might have, and my clients know I can
(provided I am given enough time to deal with the problem).</p><p>Another critical point in addition to source availability is
standardization on file formats, a field where proprietary products
are revealing their worst features. Let's imagine an environment
where every file format in the system was known: you could, for
example, create indexes from any document that is produced, thus
easing later retrieval. This can be accomplished off-line without
any load on non-technical personnel.</p><p>Asynchronous reuse of data is &ldquo;rocket science&rdquo; for many
users, because they are accustomed to programs that use proprietary
file formats (and operating systems with no real multi-tasking or
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> capabilities). As soon as
free standards are adopted, users begin asking for customizations
and are willing to pay for anything that will increase their
productivity. Moreover, free standards guarantee that customers are
not making the wrong bet, as they won't ever be stuck with unusable
data if the software market changes.</p><p>While the conventional model of software distribution
concentrates all knowledge in a few companies (or one of them),
open standards leverage technical knowledge to anyone willing to
learn. Whereas a proprietary product can be supported only by a
limited number of qualified consultants (whose number and quality
is centrally managed), the number of consultants supporting a free
software solution is virtually unlimited and the offer can quickly
adapt to the request.</p><p>In a world where computers are just tools to accomplish some
other goals, easy customization and quick maintenance are basic
requirements of power users. In my opinion, free software will
quickly gain the trust it needs to be a real market phenomenon. As
soon as you start to trust some open-source products, you learn
that they deserve more. GNU/Linux fans must be ready to offer
support in order to fulfill the upcoming need for
consultants.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdad580.0xea5be0"></a>Viability for Support Companies</h2></div></div><p>Obviously, independent consultants don't cover all the needs
of computer users. Several activities can't be handled by
individuals. Red Hat and S.u.S.E. are demonstrating that creating
and maintaining a distribution can be a good source of revenue even
when the product is freely redistributable. Debian-based efforts
are on the way, although less advanced&mdash;mainly because both Red Hat
and S.u.S.E. bundled proprietary products with Linux in order to
survive while the market share was low, while Debian is completely
detached from proprietary products.</p><p>In addition to &ldquo;creating and packaging&rdquo; jobs, open-source
companies can specialize in technical support, covering the
situations where computer systems are of critical importance. Big
business realities using computer systems in their productive
environment won't be satisfied with either the external consultant
or the in-house technician. They need to rely on an external
structure that guarantees round-the-clock operation of their
technological aids.</p><p>Even if GNU/Linux or any other operating system is
demonstrated to be completely reliable, power users will need to
rely on a support company as a form of insurance. The more
important computers are for a production environment, the more
people are willing to pay to be reassured that everything will go
on working and to have someone &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; to call in case of
any failure. Such a &ldquo;power user&rdquo; support contract could also
include a provision for refunds in case of down time. Big support
companies will be able to efficiently deal with it, and clients
will be happy to pay high rates if they never need to call for
assistance.</p><p>In short, I see no need for software companies to sell any
product; the support environment is big enough to offer good
business positions in Information Technologies. Those at the top
could use some of the revenue to pay for free software development,
thus gaining access to the best software before anyone else and
associating their name with software products. As a matter of fact,
this practice is already pursued by the big distributions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdad580.0xea5df0"></a>Viability for Education Centers</h2></div></div><p>Needless to say, schools and universities have the best
interest in teaching information technologies using free software
tools. Due to its technical superiority, free software environments
have more to offer to the students, but also need more technical
knowledge to be proficiently administered. I see no money saved
here in choosing free operating systems over proprietary ones, but
educational entities could better spend their money on hiring
system administrators than on subsidizing some already-too-big
commercial software company. While my country, Italy, is stuck with
a few rules that offer more support for buying things rather than
for increasing human resources, other countries are already moving
in the right direction&mdash;Mexico and France, for example, have
announced plans to use Linux in their public schools.</p><p>One more point leads toward free software in education: when
students get jobs, they prefer to use tools they learned at school
in order to minimize extra learning efforts. This fact should lead
colleges to teach only those tools not owned by anyone&mdash;those that
are libre. Schools should teach proprietary software only if two
conditions apply: no viable alternative is available, and the
company that distributes such software <span   class="emphasis"><em>pays</em></span>
the school for teaching its product. Paying someone for a product
and then freely advertising it for him is definitely
nonsense.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdad580.0xea5fa8"></a>Social Issues</h2></div></div><p>A few social issues relate to choosing one software model
over another one. Although I mark them as social, they have
economic implications as well.</p><p>While free software is not cheaper than proprietary software
if you bill for your own time, some environments use different
rates in converting time to money. Most emerging countries have
good intellectual resources but little money, and they usually have
many not-so-new computers as well. Proprietary operating systems
are unaffordable for them, but free solutions are viable and
productive. Actually, the &ldquo;Halloween&rdquo; document from Microsoft
underlines that Linux is growing very fast in the Far East. Charity
organizations usually have this same environment&mdash;little money and
a good amount of human resources. This leads straight to the free
software model for any IT requirement.</p><p>These ideas will probably suggest that free availability of
information looks fairly leftist in spirit, as &ldquo;information to the
masses&rdquo; looks quite similar to the old adage &ldquo;power to the
masses&rdquo;. What is usually ignored is the strong rightist flavour of
the Open Source movement. The free software arena is fiercely
meritocratic and a perfect environment for free competition, where
the laws of the market ensure that only the best ideas and the best
players survive. Proprietary standards, on the other hand, tend to
diminish competition by decreasing innovation and consolidating
previous results.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdad580.0xea6160"></a>Limits of the Free Software Model</h2></div></div><p>Naturally, I'm aware that not every software package can
easily be turned into free software. I'm not talking about office
products&mdash;I'm confident some good projects will supply this need,
sooner or later. Rather, I'm talking about all environments where a
strong competition exists for a product only loosely based on its
software component. For example, industrial equipment might include
a computer and some commodity hardware (a robot, custom I/O
peripherals, PLCs, etc.); the software application hosted in the
computer is a minor part of the whole, but its features greatly
affect the overall value of the equipment. Producing and debugging
such applications usually require huge investments (preventing free
redistribution of the source code), as a form of protection against
competitors.</p><p>Another meaningful example is cell telephones. They include a
lot of software and such software is the component that defines the
overall capabilities of the device. However, this software is
almost invisible to the end user, who perceives the device as a
telephone and not a computer. Such software is strictly proprietary
because of its major functional role in the device.</p><p>Unfortunately, I see no easy way to liberalize this type of
code. Although I don't care too much about cell phones (I don't use
them), I would prefer to see free industrial applications because
their technological content is usually worth reusing and adapting
to new problems.</p></div></div>
