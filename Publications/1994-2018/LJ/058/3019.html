    Caldera is working on a new easy-to-use configuration tool
    for Linux. Mr. Kirch gives us the details.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297c580.0x2a74558"></a></h2></div></div><p>COAS stands for Caldera Open
Administration System. It will be incorporated as the main
configuration tool in future versions of the OpenLinux
distribution.
</p><p>For those who have never used OpenLinux, the tool we have
been using for quite a while is called LISA (Linux Installation and
System Administration), which is basically one huge shell script
using a modified version of the
<span   class="bold"><b>dialog</b></span> tool to interact with the
user. When we felt it was time to move on to something new, we of
course looked at what was already available. The only viable option
at that time seemed to be LinuxConf, which had quite a ways to go
before it would become useful. Since that time it has become much
better, but because we had already started work on COAS, we decided
to stick with it. Of course, we believe our concept is
better.</p><p>The source code to COAS is released under the GNU General
Public License. We feel our work might be useful to the Linux
community as a whole and we want to invite interested programmers,
administrators and users to participate in its development by
offering comments contributing patches or even modules.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297c580.0x2a74768"></a>Vertical Modularity</h2></div></div><p>The main idea behind COAS is not to provide just another
administration tool, but an entire framework for writing one. From
the start, we wanted it to be a modular application where
assumptions about such things as system data representation, file
locations and dependencies are separated as much as possible from
user dialogs and vice versa. Ambitious as this goal may appear, our
main interest was the ability to easily adapt the tool to changes
in the underlying platform and in porting it to other Linux
platforms.</p><p>I like to call this vertical modularity, because it breaks up
the task of system administration into three layers. At the lowest
level are native system data files, such as /etc/passwd, /etc/hosts
or files that define the IP address for a particular network
interface.</p><p>On top of that, COAS implements an internal representation as
a kind of database. If this term made you jump in your seat and
shout, &ldquo;Oh no, Mr. Bill, not a Linux Registry!&rdquo;, please be
assured that this is definitely not what we want it to be. COAS is
supposed to be vi-administrator friendly. We want users to be able
to switch between COAS and vi (or Emacs) administration, because
even though we hope COAS will be useful for everyday tasks, it
cannot cover each and every feature of a system component.
(Consider the configuration monster incarnate,
<span   class="bold"><b>sendmail</b></span>--you can spend as much
time writing configuration software for it as Eric Allman keeps
churning out new features.)</p><p>The native system files will remain the primary source of
information. The COAS data model is strictly a run-time
representation of system data that attempts to hide the on-disk
representation from the upper layers. For instance, an
administration module for the BIND server should not have to bother
about where DNS zone files are located and how they are to be
parsed; all it needs is the list of DNS zones this server is a
primary or secondary name server for and the records they
contain.</p><p>Having an abstract data representation also allows for
alternate data access mechanisms. For example, our database engine
can store a change log of an administration session to a file,
which could then be distributed to other machines, thus allowing
for bulk updates. Also, there's the vague idea that COAS might one
day support remote access via LDAP or SNMP.</p><p>The top-most layer is the user interaction code. This code
drives the dialog with the user and controls what information is
displayed to the user at what time. It uses a standard set of
dialogs, provides on-line help, etc. We decided to use a scripting
language, Python, at this layer in order to allow for rapid
prototyping. In addition to this, wrapping all lower-level
functionality in Python classes and functions provides an
additional level of insulation that restricts the number of tricks
a programmer can pull. This may seem like a disadvantage to the
hackers among you, but it is truly a big plus when it comes to code
maintenance.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297c580.0x2a74a80"></a>Horizontal Modularity</h2></div></div><p>You may have guessed from my choice of the term &ldquo;vertical
modularity&rdquo; that there is also a horizontal one, and so there is.
Consider the following scenario: a security problem or other
misfeature requires you to update a component of your system, such
as the BIND name server. Alas, the update is from version 4.9 to
version 8.2, which uses an entirely different configuration file
format. We could now ask you to install an all-new version of our
administration tool in order to accommodate the new configuration
file format. On one hand, that is costly in terms of bandwidth. On
the other hand, making sure the tool operates properly with all
possible combinations of updates applied or not applied would be
rather time-consuming for us. The ideal solution would be to
package the DNS server administration module alongside our BIND
update.</p><p>We are attempting to accomplish the following: COAS lets you
rip out an entire module, including the data model definition,
Python code, message catalogs and so on, and replace it with a
different version. We have nicknamed these CLAMs, which is short
for Caldera Linux Administration Module (we invented the acronym
first and then decided on its meaning, in case you were
wondering).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297c580.0x2a74be0"></a>Data Model</h2></div></div><p>Let's take a closer look at the internal data representation.
All information is stored in a tree, with each node having an
individual name. For instance, the node containing the password of
the root user is named system.accounts.users.0.password. If you're
familiar with SNMP, think of the way SNMP variables are
named.</p><p>Nodes can have different types; e.g.,
<b  >system</b> is a directory, <b  >users</b>
is a list and <b  >password</b> is a scalar. Scalar nodes
can have various constraints attached to them; for instance, a
string may be required to match a regular expression or contain
only values from a predefined set of choices. You can also attach
your own parsing and representation functions (written in C) to a
scalar type, creating custom types that do such things as convert
date strings, e.g., <span   class="emphasis"><em>Jun 12</em></span> or
<span   class="emphasis"><em>tomorrow</em></span>, to UNIX time.</p><p>All this information is provided by the so-called schema. The
schema acts as a sort of blueprint for the data model in much the
same way an SNMP MIB definition describes the types and
organization of entities for SNMP.</p><p>For instance, the definition of the mouse parameters might
look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
MODULE   "PERIPHERALS/MOUSE"
MSGCATALOG "peripherals/mouse"
TYPEDEF DevicePathName  STRING MATCHES
    "/dev/[a-z0-9]*"
TYPEDEF MouseProtocol  STRING IN CHOICE {
    "Busmouse", "MouseSystems",
    "Mouseman", "Microsoft",
    ...
}
device         RECORD {
    model      STRING
    protocol    MouseProtocol
    deviceFile   DevicePathName DEFAULT
        "/dev/mouse"
    emulate3btn   BOOLEAN DEFAULT "false"
}
</pre><p>This creates a record named <b  >mouse</b>
containing five scalar nodes. For instance,
<b  >model</b> is a plain string variable, while
<b  >deviceFile</b> is a special string type whose
definition is shown above the record. The first two lines contain
some syntactic sugar that need not concern us at the moment.
<pre     class="programlisting">
%Those funky strings (|":MOUSE_EMULATE_NONE:"|)
%are tags for the COAS message catalogs.
</pre>


This definition would be stored in a file named
peripherals/mouse.schema (usually below /usr/lib/coas/schema) so
that the mouse configuration would be accessible by the name
<b  >peripherals.mouse.device</b>.
</p><p>When accessing data items, COAS instantiates the portions of
the instance tree from the schema definition and populates the data
by invoking so-called &ldquo;mappers&rdquo;. These mappers are responsible
for parsing and writing back system files, locking them if
necessary. Usually, they are written in C++ and kept in shared
libraries loaded on demand. The most recent release also supports
mappers written in Python.</p><p>In the case of the mouse device, there is no standard
location where this information is stored. On a Red Hat box, for
example, it is kept in /etc/sysconfig/mouse, a file which contains
a list of shell variable assignments. COAS already has a
general-purpose mapper for this type of file (it turns out that
about 80% of all system files are quite close to four or five
standard formats), so all that is left is defining the mapping.
This is done by the so-called platform repository, where we might
enter code like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
peripherals.mouse.device {
    mapper     builtin.sysconfig
    path      /etc/sysconfig/mouse
    relation    MOUSETYPE:model:\
            PROTO:protocol:\
            DEVICE:deviceFile:\
            XEMU3:emulate3btn(map=/no=false,yes=true/)
}
</pre><p>The <b  >mapper</b> keyword associates the mapper
specified with the mouse device node. When accessing the device
node, the first time, COAS detects this and invokes the mapper in
order to populate the tree below the mouse device node. The mapper
retrieves the <b  >path</b> parameter and reads the file
specified. The <b  >relation</b> parameter tells the
mapper which shell variables within the file correspond to which
data model nodes.
</p><p>The same thing happens when you have modified a protocol
(e.g., the mouse) and invoke the device node's
<span   class="bold"><b>commit</b></span> function. The data engine
will invoke the mapper in order to write the data back to the file.
Again, the mapper will use the specified
<b  >relation</b> to determine which data model values
will be assigned to which shell variables. Note that in an act of
vi-administrator friendliness, the mapper does not touch shell
variables it does not know about and tries to preserve comments as
well as it can.</p><p>The platform information is usually installed by merging it
with the main COAS platform definition, which resides in
/usr/lib/coas/repository.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297c580.0x2a755d8"></a>User Interaction</h2></div></div><p>Having written and installed the above files, you can already
display and modify the mouse configuration using COAS. For example,
COAS comes with small utilities such as
<b  >coas&nbsp;dump</b> and
<b  >coas&nbsp;change</b> that let you dump portions of
the data tree or modify individual nodes. You can even write Python
scripts that perform more complex operations on your data.</p><p>However, the ultimate goal (at least for us) is a Python
module that interacts with the user, guiding him through the
administration task. The module sits on top of the database engine
and operates exclusively on the abstract data representation. It
displays data to the user, selects which items are to be edited,
provides on-line help, etc.</p><p>Why Python? Well, a very early prototype used Tcl as the
scripting language, but for various reasons it didn't work too
well. In contrast to Tcl, Python has fairly good object support and
at least as good an extension mechanism. The other candidate was
Perl, but we decided against it because it is so easy to write
horrible code in Perl.</p><p>Communication with the user happens via an abstract user
interface API written in C++, which currently supports a curses and
a Qt front-end. Work on an extended Qt front-end that takes
advantage of features provided by KDE is in progress. Of course, in
order to be able to use this API from Python, a Python wrapper is
provided.</p><p>The user interface provides a limited but useful set of
dialogs: notice/question dialogs consisting of a text and a few
buttons; list dialogs (single- and multi-selection, with or without
check boxes, etc); prompt dialogs (containing edit fields for one
or more scalar values); and table dialogs (which display data in a
table, allowing in-place editing).</p><p><a href="3019l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>For instance, a minimal module for editing the mouse
configuration would look like Listing 1 (some of the Python fluff,
such as import statements, is not shown). For those not familiar
with Python, this code defines the class <b  >Mouse</b>,
derived from the <b  >CLAM</b> class defined in module
<b  >clam</b>. The <b  >{__init__}</b> method
is Python's way of declaring a constructor.</p><p>The method <b  >run</b> is invoked by COAS. The
first thing it does is look up the data model node for the mouse
device. As described above, this step will trigger the parsing of
the configuration file into the internal data
representation.</p><p>Next, a prompt dialog is created and three edit fields are
added for the mouse's model, protocol and device file. The last few
lines are the somewhat standard dialog loop. Depending on whether
the user terminates the dialog by pressing the Okay or Cancel
button, either the <b  >commit</b> or
<b  >cancel</b> method (inherited from the
<b  >CLAM</b> base class) is invoked, which displays a
small question dialog along the lines of &ldquo;Do you really want to
save/cancel?&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297c580.0x2a6c5f8"></a>What about Labels?</h2></div></div><p>The first thing that will probably strike you as odd about
this example is that it has no label strings anywhere.
Nevertheless, the dialog is supposed to have a title, edit fields
are supposed to have a label to their left, etc.</p><p>The answer is that COAS generates NLS strings for you out of
the information it has. For instance, when creating the prompt
dialog, we inconspicuously passed the string
<b  >mouse</b> into the function. As a consequence, COAS
will create tags such as <b  >|":MOUSE_TITLE:"|</b> for
the dialog's title and attempt to look it up in the module's
message catalog. (The message catalog name was specified in the
class constructor.) Likewise, for the <b  >protocol</b>
edit field, it will generate the tag
<b  >|":MOUSE_PROTOCOL_LABEL:"|</b>. All you need to do
is write the message catalog, mapping these funky strings to
intelligible English (or French, German, etc.) and install the
file.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297c580.0x2a6c8b8"></a>Editing Data</h2></div></div><p>Looking at the sample code above, you may also have thought:
I understand where they put the data in the dialog, but how do they
put it back into the data model?</p><p>This is the interesting part about the data editing process.
If you have ever programmed Motif, you know how tedious it can be
to extract the value to be edited from the data model, put it into
the dialog and write the resulting value back to the data model
when the user hits the OK button.</p><p>The approach taken by COAS is to tie data model nodes into
the dialog directly and let the dialog select an appropriate widget
type (string, combo box, toggle button, spin button, etc.). When
the user provides a new value, the dialog will automatically check
the value's syntax against data model constraints and write it back
into the data model.</p><p>In our example, the dialog would create a simple string edit
field for <b  >deviceName</b>, a pop-up list for
<b  >protocol</b> (since it is limited to a set of
choices) and a toggle button for
<b  >emulation</b>.</p><p>What's more, this mechanism offers you easy-to-use context
help for each input field, bound to the <b  >f2</b> key.
Adding this type of help to a data item is as easy as adding the
<b  >HELP</b> attribute to the data definition in the
schema file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
device         RECORD {
    model      STRING HELP "HELP_MODEL"
    protocol    MouseProtocol HELP "HELP_PROTOCOL"
    ...
}
</pre><p>These help messages will be looked up in the message catalog
associated with the schema file (remember the
<b  >MSGCATALOG</b> keyword in the schema file?) and
displayed in a pop-up dialog whenever the user presses
<b  >f2</b>.
</p><p>Of course, every scheme you devise has a drawback. In this
case, it is how to cancel changes made during the execution of the
dialog. When the user presses the Cancel button, he wants all
changes to go away.</p><p>This is where the <b  >marker</b> object comes into
play. The data node's <b  >getMarker</b> method obtains a
marker for the node's change log (called a journal in COAS lingo).
When the user requests a discard of all changes, the CLAM base
class invokes <b  >self.mouse.cancel(marker)</b>, which
reverts all changes made after the marker object was
obtained.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297c580.0x2a6cff0"></a>Where's the Beer? er, Beef?</h2></div></div><p>I have to admit that the above example, in its simplicity, is
a bit deceptive. What I'm showing here is the simplest version of a
dialog. In fact, what you see here is just a glorious interface to
the configuration file because it does not offer the user any help
or guidance. A good dialog would automatically choose the
appropriate device file when a selection is made (e.g., a bus
mouse) and keep the user from enabling three-button emulation for
mice that already have three buttons. As a consequence, your
average COAS module will have a lot more than those 20-odd lines in
the example above.</p><p>However, the greatest advantage COAS offers in this context
is that it relieves you of the usual hassle when working with a GUI
and lets you concentrate on the data flow instead.</p><p><a href="3019s1.html" target="_self">Dependency Model</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297c580.0x2a6d200"></a>Are You Curious?</h2></div></div><p>If this article has piqued your interest and you would like
