    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x20b9348"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Linux ATM software (device driver and
utilities) is developed and supported by Werner Almsberger in
Switzerland as part of the Linux-ATM API software set (see
Resources). This software contains device drivers for the following
ATM adapters: Efficient ENI-155P, SMC ATM Power 155, Rolf Fiedler's
TNETA1570 board, Zeitnet ZN1221/ZN1225 and the IDT 77901/77903 155
and 25 Mbps adapters. Also, a driver for the Fore PCA-200E ATM
adapter is available separately (see Resources). The two adapters I
have experience with are the Efficient ENI-155p and the Fore
PCA-200E.
</p><p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
uses ATM and Fast-Ethernet networks as interconnects in its
scalable cluster computing initiative. One research area is
evaluating the benefits of ATM and Fast-Ethernet networks in this
cluster environment.</p><p>In this article, I will tell you how to obtain and install
the ATM support software and device drivers. I will also describe
how to configure the ATM connections on the PCs and the switch to
be used for IP network traffic.</p><p>The ATM interface cards I use are ENI-155P ATM adapters
produced by Efficient Networks and PCA-200EPC adapters from Fore
Systems. These cards are installed in standard Pentium or
Pentium-Pro-based PCs running Linux. The ATM switch I used for this
article is a Fore ASX-1000, although the information I give applies
to all of the Fore ATM switches. This switch can be set up to allow
the Linux workstations to use IP over both Switched Virtual
Circuits (SVC) and Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVC).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x20b9558"></a>Obtaining and Installing the Linux-ATM
Software</h2></div></div><p>The ATM software is available from
http://lrcwww.epfl.ch/linux-atm/. The software is packaged as a
compressed, gzipped tar file. Each version of the software is tied
to a specific version of the Linux kernel. For this article, I used
version 0.35 running on Linux kernel 2.1.90. The size of the ATM
software distribution is roughly 500KB. The device driver for the
Fore PCA-200E adapter can be obtained by anonymous FTP from
ftp://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/pub/pca200e/. Refer to the README file
in the PCA200 distribution for further information.</p><p>The driver portion of the Linux-ATM software, as well as the
changes to the Linux kernel, are shipped as one large patch file.
Therefore, adding support to the Linux kernel for ATM is
straightforward: apply the kernel patch, configure and rebuild the
kernel in the usual way. The ATM configuration items you must have
are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
(CONFIG_ATM)</p></li><li><p>Classical IP over ATM with ATMARP
(CONFIG_ATM_ATMARP)</p></li><li><p>Device driver, one of the following:Efficient
Networks ENI155P (CONFIG_ATM_ENI)ZeitNet ZN1221/ZN1225
(CONFIG_ATM_ZATM)Rolfs TI TNETA1570 (CONFIG_ATM_TNETA1570)IDT 77201
(NICSTAR) (CONFIG_ATM_NICSTAR)</p></li></ul></div><p>I recommend starting with a fresh Linux kernel source tree
before applying the ATM patch. Refer to the USAGE file that is part
of the Linux-ATM software, as things may change. All of the device
drivers in the distribution can be built as kernel modules or as
part of the kernel object itself. If you are using a Fore PCA-200E
adapter, you do not select a driver during the kernel
configuration. The PCA-200E device driver is built as a module
separately, as specified in the README file included in the PCA200
distribution.
</p><p>After the kernel is patched, rebuilt and installed, you are
ready to build the ATM support software. Again, refer to the
instructions in the USAGE file. One change I recommend is
installing the support files in /usr/local/atm-version/bin and
creating a soft link from /usr/local/atm to the actual install
directory. By using the soft link, you can change ATM software
levels and back them out, if needed, without changing the
configuration scripts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x20b99d0"></a>Configuring the ATM Device Interface</h2></div></div><p>You are now ready to configure the IP over ATM. First, you
must decide what type of &ldquo;virtual circuits&rdquo; to use to connect the
machines. ATM is a point-to-point, switched technology; in order
for two hosts to communicate, a virtual circuit must be established
between them.</p><p>Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs) are connections that are
established dynamically and torn down when the connection is no
longer needed. However, a high latency is associated with
establishing a connection. Also, SVCs are deleted after a timeout
period if no traffic is sent over the connection. Therefore, the
latency associated with SVCs is not always predictable. I
encountered several problems when using SVCs, such as connections
not being established or sometimes failing to remain open.</p><p>Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVCs) are established and kept
open. Thus, no latency is associated with establishing the
connection, as there is when using SVCs. The disadvantage of PVCs
is that the switch must be configured to establish all the
connections between the hosts. When you have several hosts and each
host needs to communicate with all the others, the number of PVCs
required within the ATM switch grows rapidly. Specific
configuration information for SVCs and PVCs is discussed later, but
I will jump ahead a bit in order to complete the IP configuration
now. The steps to configure the ATM interface are as
follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Start the ATM software daemons with these commands:
<pre     class="programlisting">
 atmsigd -b
 ilmid -b
 atmarpd -b
</pre>

</p></li><li><p>Create the ATM device name:
<pre     class="programlisting">
 atmarp -c atm0
</pre>

</p></li><li><p>Configure the ATM interface for IP:
<pre     class="programlisting">
 ifconfig atm0 ipaddr netmask netmask mtu mtu
</pre>

</p></li><li><p>Add the route for the ATM subnet:
<pre     class="programlisting">
 route add -net network netmask netmask atm0
</pre>

</p></li><li><p>Create a permanent ATM ARP (address resolution
protocol) cache entry for the ARP server:
<pre     class="programlisting">
 atmarp -s arpserver arpsrvnsap arpsrv
</pre>

</p></li></ul></div><p><b  >ipaddr</b> is the IP address of the ATM
interface, <b  >netmask</b> is the network mask and
<b  >network</b> is the IP address of the network to
which we are connecting. <b  >arpserver</b> is the IP
address of the ATM ARP server and <b  >arpsrvnsap</b> is
the ATM address of the ARP server. The ATM ARP server is used to
convert an IP address to an ATM network service access point (NSAP)
address. (The NSAP address is similar to a media access control
(MAC) address and is 20 octets long.) The NSAP address is needed to
establish SVCs between nodes. You can also create an /etc/hosts.atm
file to contain the IP to NSAP mapping, allowing for quicker IP to
NSAP translations. For my network, I use the Fore switch as the ARP
server. The <span   class="bold"><b>atmarpd</b></span> daemon
maintains a cache of IP to NSAP mappings. The
<span   class="bold"><b>atmarp</b></span> command makes the ARP cache
entry permanent when the <b  >arpsrv</b> option is
used.</p><p>One final note: if you are going to use PVCs only, you do not
need to start the <span   class="bold"><b>atmsigd</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>ilmid</b></span> daemons.
<a href="3005l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> contains a complete
example of configuration commands.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x20ba580"></a>Configuration of Switched Virtual
Circuits</h2></div></div><p>The ATM switch configuration commands I use apply to the
entire family of Fore ATM switches, because they all have a similar
command interface.</p><p>When using SVCs, a host must pass information to the ATM
switch, declaring its intent to set up a connection with another
host. The term for connection setup is &ldquo;signaling&rdquo;. The ATM
protocol used between a host and a switch is the
user-network-interface (UNI) signaling standard. There are several
revisions of the UNI standard. The Fore ATM switch supports UNI
3.0, 3.1 and 4.0. The Linux-ATM software also supports these
versions.</p><p>However, there are standards and there are implementations.
In setting up our SVCs, I encountered several problems with UNI 3.0
signaling. The UNI 3.1 signaling was more stable and reliable. To
change the signaling on the Fore ATM switch, each port must be
changed individually, using the switch control processor (SCP)
command interface.</p><p>First, log on to the SCP via a TELNET session or by using a
terminal attached to the serial port on the Fore switch. The
command syntax used here is the same as Fore's. Required parameters
are shown between &ldquo;&lt;&rdquo; and &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo;; options are enclosed in
brackets (&ldquo;[&rdquo; and &ldquo;]&rdquo;); modifiers to options are enclosed in
parentheses. One of the modifiers must be chosen.</p><p>Change to the UNI configuration menu:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="emphasis"><em>localhost::&gt;</em></span> conf uni
</pre><p>The switch prompt is shown in italics, while the command is
shown in normal text.
</p><p>The command <span   class="bold"><b>show</b></span> will list
the current UNI status for each port. If the port is already
configured for UNI 3.1, no change needs to be made. Otherwise, you
must first delete the current configuration. The syntax for the
delete command is <b  >del <i><tt>port
vpi</tt></i></b>, where <span   class="emphasis"><em>port</em></span> is the
switch port and <span   class="emphasis"><em>vpi</em></span> is the virtual path
identifier (usually 0). To delete the signaling on port 1A1 for VPI
0, you would enter this command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="emphasis"><em>localhost::configuration uni&gt;</em></span> del 1a1 0
</pre><p>Now you are ready to configure the port for UNI 3.1. The
syntax for the new command is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
new &lt;port&gt;&lt;vpi&gt; [auto | uni30 | uni31] [-ilmi (up | down)]
</pre>


The <b  >ilmi</b> option is used when you want the port
to respond to integrated local management interface (ILMI)
requests. ILMI is used by the hosts to obtain the ATM NSAP address
assigned to the host. You usually want to have ILMI active for the
port, so the command for port 1A1, VPI 0 is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="emphasis"><em>localhost::configuration uni&gt;</em></span> new 1a1 0 uni31 -ilmi up
</pre>


Now that the ATM switch ports have been configured, the software on
the workstation must be set up. The key portions of the Linux-ATM
software are three daemons:
<span   class="bold"><b>atmsigd</b></span> to handle signaling (UNI),
<span   class="bold"><b>ilmid</b></span> to handle ATM address
registration and <span   class="bold"><b>atmarpd</b></span> to map
ATM addresses to IP addresses. Listing 1 is the startup script I
use to start the ATM daemons and to configure the ATM interface on
a host. This script can be called from a system startup script
(/etc/rc.d/rc.local, for example) to configure the ATM interface at
boot time.
</p><p>The ATM signaling daemon,
<span   class="bold"><b>atmsigd</b></span>, must be compiled
specifically for the version of signaling you wish to use and must
be compatible with the signaling version the ATM switch port has
been configured to use. The default version used in the ATM
software is UNI 3.0. If you've configured the switch to use UNI
3.1, having the hosts use UNI 3.0 will most likely work, due to
backward compatibility. However, I recommend you configure the
Linux-ATM software to use the same version as the switch, UNI
3.1.</p><p>To have the signaling daemon use UNI 3.1, edit the Rules.make
file in the ATM source directory ( /usr/src/atm if you follow the
steps in the USAGE file). You need to change the STANDARDS line to
specify the version of signaling to support. For UNI 3.1, this line
should be: <b  >STANDARDS=-DUNI31</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x24b3220"></a>Special Configuration for ENI-155p ATM
Cards</h2></div></div><p>If you are using Efficient ENI-155p ATM cards, the number of
simultaneous virtual channels available is limited. The ENI card
performs the segmentation and reassembly (SAR) of ATM cells by
using memory on the adapter card as a buffer. The host ATM software
allocates buffer space for each virtual channel. If you attempt to
open more SVCs than are supported by the available buffer space,
you will receive this error message from the ATM ARP daemon:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
atmarpd:IO: [2]connect: No buffer space available
</pre><p>When IP over ATM is used, the device driver sends packets to
the ATM card using an ATM Adaptation Layer (AAL). While several
adaptation layers are available, AAL-5 is used for IP. The AAL-5
packet is a type of service data unit (SDU) and is somewhat
analogous to an Ethernet frame. The AAL-5 packets are divided into
individual ATM cells by the Efficient ATM adapter.
</p><p>The MTU (maximum transmission unit) size for the ATM
interface depends on the SDU size. The IP over ATM (Classical IP)
specification says that the MTU should be no larger than 9180
bytes. There are also 8 bytes for an AAL-5 trailer, so the SDU for
IP over ATM is 9188 bytes in the default configuration. The amount
of buffer space needed on the card depends on the maximum SDU
size.</p><p>The Linux-ATM software allocates three times the maximum SDU
size, rounded up to the nearest power of two. In the default
configuration, this allocation results in 32KB of buffer space
being reserved for each ATM connection (9180 x 3 = 27540, rounded
to 32768 bytes). Also, using classical IP causes two SVCs to be
made: the initiating machine opens an active connection to the
target machine and the target machine opens an active connection
back, that is, a passive connection on the initiator. Therefore,
these two connections result in the allocation of two buffers on
the ATM card, for a total of 64KB.</p><p>The default configuration allows a host to have a maximum of
fourteen simultaneous connections when using the &ldquo;client&rdquo; version
of the ENI-155p ATM card, which has 512KB of memory and 504KB of
memory available for the SAR buffers. These fourteen connections
allow communication using IP over ATM to seven other hosts when
using SVCs. If you set up PVCs, you can communicate with fourteen
other hosts. When using an ARP server, you have one less connection
available, reducing the host count by one as well. The &ldquo;server&rdquo;
version of the ENI 155p card has 2MB of memory, with 2040KB for SAR
buffers, allowing for more simultaneous connections.</p><p>To increase the number of simultaneous connections for
classical IP, you need to change the size of the maximum SDU set on
the ATM interface. By using the allocation rule given above, you
can estimate the amount of memory needed for the connections. For
example, if you want to use 16KB for each connection, the maximum
SDU would be 16384 divided by 3, which is 5461 bytes. I'll use an
SDU of 4352 bytes for my example in this article.</p><p>The maximum SDU is specified as an option to the ATM ARP
daemon. However, when the SDU is changed, the IP interface must
also be configured to have an MTU of the same size as the SDU,
minus 8 bytes for the AAL-5 trailer. Therefore, in my example the
MTU is 4344 bytes.</p><p>A potential problem occurs when changing the maximum SDU for
the interface: the ATM ARP daemon
(<span   class="bold"><b>atmarpd</b></span>) may not communicate with
the ARP server on the Fore switch. Our switch would accept only
connections with an SDU of 9188 bytes. The fix for this problem is
to create a permanent ARP cache entry on the host, specifying the
maximum SDU of 9188 bytes, for the connection to the ARP server.
The steps for configuring the ATM software on the workstation are
as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Configure the IP interface for your MTU size, 4344
bytes in my example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ifconfig atm0 ipaddr netmask netmask mtu 4344
</pre>

</p></li><li><p>Create a permanent ATM ARP cache entry for the ARP
server with SDU size of 9188:
<pre     class="programlisting">
atmarp -s arpserver arpsrvnsap qos \
ubr:sdu=9188 arpsrv
</pre>

</p></li><li><p>Configure the SDU (MTU plus 8 bytes) on the ATM
interface:
<pre     class="programlisting">
atmarp -q network ubr:sdu=4352
</pre>

</p></li></ul></div><p>Refer to Listing 1 for a complete example of configuring the
ATM software for the Efficient adapter.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x24b3a08"></a>Using IP over Permanent Virtual Circuits</h2></div></div><p>To establish a PVC, the following steps must be
performed.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>On the workstation, add an ATM ARP entry on each
node specifying the PVC
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>vpi</em></span>.<span   class="emphasis"><em>vci</em></span> pair) used to
connect to each of the other hosts.</p></li><li><p>Create the PVC on the switch.</p></li></ul></div><p>As an example, the following commands executed on the
appropriate host will set up a PVC between nodes named node1 and
node2, on interface 0, using a vpi of 0 and a vci of 70:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  ><i><tt>node1:</tt></i> atmarp
-s node2 0.0.70</b></p></li><li><p><b  ><i><tt>node2:</tt></i> atmarp
-s node1 0.0.70</b></p></li></ul></div>

The PVC is identified by three numbers, separated by two periods.
The numbering scheme is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>interface</em></span>.<span   class="emphasis"><em>vpi</em></span>.<span   class="emphasis"><em>vci</em></span>,
where interface is 0 for the first ATM adapter, 1 for the next,
etc. The default interface for the atmarp command is 0. The
<span   class="emphasis"><em>vpi</em></span> (virtual path identifier) and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>vci</em></span> (virtual channel identifier) are the
standard ATM PVC identifiers. The host name (node1 and node2) can
be used if there is an entry for it in the /etc/hosts file;
otherwise, use the IP address of the host.
</p><p>The commands above tell node1 to communicate with node2 over
PVC <b  >0.0.70</b> and for node2 to communicate with
node1 over PVC <b  >0.0.70</b>. The atmarp command links
the IP address of the target host to the PVC. You could choose a
different PVC for each connection, but it is simpler to think in
terms of one PVC connecting two machines.</p><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>vpi</em></span>.<span   class="emphasis"><em>vci</em></span> pair
must not be in use on the host. Also, any ATM ARP cache entries
must be deleted for the target host before creating the PVC. (These
cache entries are created when SVCs are opened to the destination
host.) To delete an ARP cache entry on node1 for node2, you would
use this command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="emphasis"><em>node1:</em></span> atmarp -d node2
</pre><p>Next, the switch must be configured to complete the PVC
between the hosts. It is helpful to understand the port naming
convention used by the Fore switch. The port names consist of three
identifiers:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Board: the number of the switch board (same as the
SCP number); each SCP controls one switch board.</p></li><li><p>Network Module: the slot (A, B, C, or D) in the
switch board containing the port.</p></li><li><p>Port: the physical port number on the network
module.</p></li></ul></div>

For example, port 1b3 refers to the first switch board, the second
network module (module b) on board 1 and the third physical port on
the second network module. The Fore ASX-200 switch has only one
switch board, while the ASX-1000 switch has four. There is a
maximum of four network modules per switch board and a maximum of
six physical ports per module.
</p><p>You must now create the virtual channels on the ATM switch.
In our example, you would enter these commands on SCP 1:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="emphasis"><em>localhost::&gt;</em></span> conf vcc
<span   class="emphasis"><em>localhost::configuration vcc&gt;</em></span> new 1a1 0 70 1a2 0 70
<span   class="emphasis"><em>localhost::configuration vcc&gt;</em></span> new 1a2 0 70 1a1 0 70
</pre><p><b  >1a1</b> is the switch port for node1 and
<b  >1a2</b> is the switch port for node2.
</p><p>The switch completes the PVC based on the input port to
output port virtual channel connection (VCC) mapping. Note that the
PVC <span   class="emphasis"><em>vpi</em></span>.<span   class="emphasis"><em>vci</em></span>
(<b  >0.70</b>) matches the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>vpi</em></span>.<span   class="emphasis"><em>vci</em></span> given to the
atmarp commands on the hosts.</p><p>The above commands will connect two ports on the same ATM
switch board. The Fore ASX-1000 switch has up to four switch
boards. If you are connecting machines on different switch boards,
the procedure is more complicated, as you must connect each port to
the switch fabric and connect the fabric to each port. Thus, if you
wish to connect a machine on port <b  >1a1</b> to a
machine on port <b  >3a1</b>, the following commands are
required:</p><p>On SCP 1:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="emphasis"><em>localhost::&gt;</em></span> conf vcc
<span   class="emphasis"><em>localhost::configuration vcc&gt;</em></span> new 1a1 0 70 1e3 0 70
<span   class="emphasis"><em>localhost::configuration vcc&gt;</em></span> new 1e3 0 70 1a1 0 70
</pre><p>On SCP 3:
<pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="emphasis"><em>localhost::&gt;</em></span> conf vcc
<span   class="emphasis"><em>localhost::&gt;configuration vcc&gt;</em></span> new 3a1 0 70 3e1 0 70
<span   class="emphasis"><em>localhost::&gt;configuration vcc&gt;</em></span> new 3e1 0 70 3a1 0 70
</pre>


On the Fore switch, the fabric connections are slot e. Therefore,
port <b  >1e3</b> refers to a connection from switch
board 1 to switch board 3. Likewise, <b  >3e1</b> refers
to a connection from switch board 3 to switch board 1. Fore refers
to these ports as &ldquo;intra-fabric&rdquo; ports.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x23c6df8"></a>Testing the Connections</h2></div></div><p>Once the Classical IP setup is complete, all of the standard
network tests can be performed. The simplest test is done by using
the ping command to test the connection. One difference between SVC
and PVC connections is a large latency for the first ping response
when using SVCs. The reason for the latency is the setup time
needed to establish the SVC. After the SVC is established, the
latency for SVC and PVC connections should be the same.</p><p>After verifying the basic connectivity, you can run some
network performance tests over the ATM connection. I have used the
Netperf tool (see Resources) as well as some benchmarks developed
locally. The maximum throughput performance is very good, around
132Mbps. This number is close to the maximum payload data rate for
an OC-3 ATM network.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x23c6f58"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>I have given instructions needed to set up the switch and
hosts on an ATM network with Linux. The configuration steps given
are specific to IP over ATM connections using the Classical IP
standard. In addition to Classical IP, LAN Emulation (LANE) can be
used to carry IP over ATM. LANE is supported by the Linux-ATM
software as well, but configuration of LANE is beyond the scope of
this article. For more information, refer to the documentation in
the Linux-ATM distribution.</p><p>Hosts can communicate in several other ways using an ATM
interface without relying on Classical IP. The ATM software
supports &ldquo;native&rdquo; ATM sockets, where applications can communicate
directly over an ATM connection, bypassing the IP software
completely.</p><p>If you are interested in learning about ATM technology but
don't have ATM hardware, the Linux-ATM software can be of help. The
software has the capability to emulate an ATM device using TCP/IP
to make the actual connection. By taking advantage of this support,
you can get a head start on configuring ATM for Linux and learning
the ATM programming interface.</p><p><a href="3005s1.html" target="_self">NIST</a></p><p><a href="3005s2.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
