    gtkcookie, guitar, gentoo and more.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d04580.0x1dfc5b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Welcome to the second installment of my
look at software packages worth downloading. I always find
something good on the Internet. A lot of developers have been quite
busy and are turning out some excellent software. The hot
development library seems to be GTK+, and with so many novice Linux
users who are not command-line oriented, it is a good thing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d04580.0x1dfc6b8"></a>gtkcookie:</h2></div></div><p>http://www.110.net/~pq1036/
</p><p>Do a lot of web surfing? Notice how many sites want to leave
little droppings called &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; on your system? So many, in
fact, I added a hard drive to store them all. Okay, I actually
needed more space to download and compile programs like this one.
It is a slick, easy way to view, edit and delete cookies. Frankly,
I would rather eat them. Required libraries are gtk-1.0.6, Xi,
Xext, X11, m and glibc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d04580.0x1dfc818"></a>guitar:</h2></div></div><p>http://disq.bir.net.tr/guitar/
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>guitar</b></span> is another of those
utilities you love to have. I like this wrapper for tar despite the
fact that I am quite comfortable on a command line.
<span   class="bold"><b>guitar</b></span> lets you see what is inside
a tar or gzipped tar file, read the text files inside, and extract
the one you want. It also lets you create a directory for storing
the files. This version does not create tar files, but I'll bet
future versions will. Required libraries are gtk-1.0.6, Xi, Xext,
X11, m and glibc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d04580.0x1dfca28"></a>gentoo:</h2></div></div><p>http://www.obsession.se/gentoo/
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>gentoo</b></span> is yet another file
manager. It looks simple, but hides a lot of complexity. It will
copy, move, and do other things as well. A three-row button bar on
the bottom can be configured as you see fit. In fact, the most
complicated part of this program seems to be figuring out how to
fill up all the empty buttons rather then actually doing it. The
configuration box takes a cue from other recent systems that use
tabs across the top of the box to change to various configuration
pages. Once it is configured (the default configuration is actually
quite good), it is easy to use. Required libraries are gtk-1.0.6,
Xext, X11, m and glibc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d04580.0x1dfcbe0"></a>slashes.pl:</h2></div></div><p>http://members.xoom.com/alexsh/slashes/
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>slashes.pl</b></span> is a small Perl
script that all the &ldquo;dotheads&rdquo; in the audience will like. It is a
way to keep the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Slashdot.org</em></span> headlines on your
screen while having your web browser open to it all day long, just
so you can press reload. This program allows you to see the
headlines whenever you wish, just in case a news article appears
that you would like to read. While I had trouble with the &ldquo;Read&rdquo;
button even after setting the line to point to my Netscape binary
(it would crash), I suspect I just need to reread the script and
find out what I am doing wrong for my setup. Required libraries are
Perl, gtk-1.0.6 and the libgtk-perl module.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d04580.0x1dfcdf0"></a>The Gaby Address Book of Yesterday:</h2></div></div><p>http://www.multimania.com/fpeters/gaby/
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Gaby</b></span> is a deceptively simple
address book. It carries all the latest fields for those needing to
keep up with more than just phone and fax numbers. Space is
reserved for URL, e-mail address and more. What it lacks is a way
to connect to a database engine like MySQL. The flat-file method
works well for individuals, but is not practical for a site where
multiple users may have years of contacts listed. This one is great
for single users and has the potential for larger sites if it can
connect to a database engine. Required libraries are gtk-1.0.6,
Xext, X11, m and glibc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d04580.0x1dfcfa8"></a>The Amazing Anagram Thingie:</h2></div></div><p>http://www.vis.colostat.edu/~scriven/anagrammer.php3/
</p><p>This is a command line &ldquo;game&rdquo; to help you with those pesky
anagram puzzles&mdash;very fast, very simple and easy to use. A phrase
of any length will have this one scrolling anagram solutions off
the screen for a long time. It is a great game for those puzzled by
anagrams. Required library is glibc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d04580.0x1dfd108"></a>Ministry of Truth:</h2></div></div><p>http://tomato.nvgc.vt.edu/~hroberts/mot/
</p><p>This particular package has been out for a few months, has
earned a place in my own system and will soon occupy an internal
web site where I regularly work. Sometimes keeping track of jobs is
difficult. This program makes it a breeze. It can track most users,
software, equipment, jobs and people associated with them. While it
requires MySQL, it handles everything once MySQL is installed and
configured. For those requiring assistance, a (very low volume)
user mail list has been set up. Required libraries are Apache with
the php3 module compiled with MySQL, and MySQL.</p><p>Still lots more good packages out there. See you next
month.</p></div></div>
