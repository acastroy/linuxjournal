the hard drive. Is there any way to log in to it without the
password? I have a UNIX book but it does not address this problem.
Do I have to re-install? I have no idea who the previous owner
was. &mdash;Mike, shbecke@ibm.net</p><p>Try to boot the computer in single user mode (type linux
single at the LILO prompt). If this does not work, you should get
boot floppies in order to start a minimum LINUX in a RAM disk. Such
floppies should be available in a Slackware distribution. Then you
could mount the root partition by typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mount -t ext2 /dev/hda1 /mnt
</pre><p>and edit /mnt/etc/passwd in order to suppress the
root password. &mdash;Pierre Ficheux, pficheux@com1.fr
</p><p>One of the simplest ways to do this is to obtain a
boot and root disk pair from the Slackware distribution. Boot using
both and use mount(8) to mount the root file system from your
laptop. You can then edit the mount_dir/etc/passwd (or
mount_dir/etc/shadow) file to remove the
password.For system administrators concerned with this potential
security problem, the only way to prevent it is through the use of
BIOS features that prevent access to the floppy drive without a
password. This is not a Linux security flaw&mdash;any UNIX platform that
may be booted from a set of floppies or from a CD-ROM that allows
access to the hard drive has the potential to be &ldquo;hacked&rdquo; in this
way. Notable exceptions are systems that use encrypted file
systems, but those are rare and often much slower during normal
operation. &mdash;Chad Robinson, chadr@brt.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc5d580.0xd55348"></a>Software in RPMs</h2></div></div><p>I have Slackware Linux. Wherever I look, I find software that
is in RPMs. Is there no option other than shifting to Red Hat? Any
conversion utilities? &mdash;Aseem Asthana,
asthana@bom4.vsnl.net.in</p><p>Try the package
<a href="http://www.chez.com/imil/stuff/rpm4everyone.tar.gz" target="_self">www.chez.com/imil/stuff/rpm4everyone.tar.gz</a>;
I use it every day on an old Slackware 3.0 distribution. &mdash;Pierre
Ficheux, pficheux@com1.fr</p><p>Try <span   class="bold"><b>alien</b></span>, a package that
converts packages from one format to another. Otherwise, compile
<span   class="bold"><b>rpm</b></span> on your system so you can do
the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm2cpio package.rpm | cpio -list
rpm2cpio package.rpm | cpio -make-dirs -extract
</pre><p>It is quite handy. Note, however, that you might
find incompatibilities between your system and the Red Hat
packages. I always prefer compiling programs from source when I am
on Slackware (but I might be overly cautious). &mdash;Alessandro Rubini,

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc5d580.0xd556b8"></a>a.out</h2></div></div><p>I just installed Red Hat's Linux 5.0. I used the C compiler
to compile a simple C program, test.c, using the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gcc test.c
</pre><p>The program compiled and produced an executable called a.out.
When I try to run a.out by typing:
<pre     class="programlisting">
a.out
</pre>


I get a message that says a.out is not a recognized command. What
am I doing wrong? &mdash;Jeff Miller, jeff_miller@msn.com
</p><p>First confirm that the a.out file has the correct
permissions. Use <b  >ls</b> <b  >-al
a.out</b> to confirm that the executable (x) bit is
set. If it isn't, use the chmod +x command to set this flag. If the
permissions are correct, specify the full path to the file, as the
current directory usually isn't in your default path.
Use <b  >./a.out</b> to ensure you
are attempting to execute the correct program. Change your path by
editing the /etc/profile file or the profile file in your home
directory. &mdash;Vince Waldon,
vince.waldon@cnpl.enbridge.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc5d580.0xd55a28"></a>Disk Space</h2></div></div><p>How do I find out how much free space is left on my
  disk? &mdash;Kirk, sci@wadi-petro.com</p><p>Use the <span   class="bold"><b>df</b></span> command. Briefly,
running df without arguments will show the free space (in KB) on
all your disks; <b  >df /some_directory</b>
will show the space left on the disk that
<b  >/some_directory</b> is on. Also note that
df has an undocumented <b  >-h</b>
option that shows sizes in GB or MB as
appropriate&mdash;convenient for today's large disks. See the man pages
for information on other options. &mdash;Scott Maxwell,
s-max@pacbell.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc5d580.0xd55ce8"></a>Relaying E-mail</h2></div></div><p>The problem is the following. Each time I try to send an
e-mail using a program that manages pop3 accounts such as Eudora or
Netscape Mail, I receive the following message: &ldquo;The recipient
user@domain.com is not acceptable to your SMTP server. The message
is not sendable until the recipient has been changed.&rdquo;</p><p>This problem appeared after we upgraded from the previous
version of Linux to version 5.0. No problem occurs when receiving
e-mail using these programs or when sending e-mail through
Pine&mdash;only when using Eudora or any other similar program. How can
we solve this? &mdash;Ricardo A. Williams L.,
rick@corotu.stri.si.edu</p><p>The problem is in the new security policies of Red Hat 5.
Your mail gets refused with a message of &ldquo;551 we do not relay&rdquo;.
The solution here is authorizing your client machine to relay mail
through the Linux server. Your /etc/sendmail.cf is quite clear
about the options:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# file containing IP numbers of machines which can
# use our relay
F{LocalIP} /etc/mail/ip_allow
# file containing names of machines which can
# use our relay
F{LocalNames} /etc/mail/name_allow
# file containing names we relay to
F{RelayTo} /etc/mail/relay_allow
</pre><p>Add lines to the proper file describing either the
client's IP, the client's name or the recipient's name. &mdash;Alessandro
Rubini, rubini@prosa.it

Linux box at home and my office workstation (DEC station running
Digital UNIX). The problem is that the DEC machine is
not a gateway, so I cannot reach the rest of
the subnet or the rest of the world, for that matter. Is there a
way my Linux box can reach the subnet gateway which is two hops
away? The <span   class="bold"><b>route</b></span> command in my
current version of Linux (Slackware, kernel 2.0.0) does not support
the <b  >-hobcount</b> flag, which is supported by
Digital UNIX and would do the trick. &mdash;Martin Olivera,
martin@pantano.ucsd.edu</p><p>If your PPP IP address is one from the subnet your DEC
station is sitting on, you just need to make sure it does ARP
proxying for your Linux machine (in other words, it has to accept
packets for your Linux machine's IP on its local Ethernet). If this
is not the case, then it is more difficult. The options you have
are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Find out if Digital UNIX can do IP
masquerading like Linux can.</p></li><li><p>Configure <span   class="bold"><b>routed</b></span> on your DEC
server and advertise a route pointing to your Linux machine. Note
that this will not work if your default gateway ignores RIP
information, and it may upset your network administrator and/or be
against company policies.</p></li></ul></div><p>&mdash;Marc Merlin, marc@merlins.org
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc5d580.0xd563c8"></a>Typing Spanish Characters</h2></div></div><p>As a Spanish speaker, I want to use a keyboard with a
complete set of Latin characters. I succeeded in implementing it
for almost all applications, except Netscape. I installed the
XKeysymDB file in the correct place, and this file works properly
for Sun machines (I tested), but not for PCs with Linux. I tried to
find the answer at Netscape's home page, but I couldn't. Perhaps I
did the wrong search. Does anyone know how to set Netscape in order
to have a &ldquo;compose&rdquo; key which produces accents, tildes and all
that sort of thing? &mdash;Guigue, guigue@nucate.unicamp.br</p><p>If I'm not mistaken, the XKeysymDB file works only for a
particular keyboard, so the one that works for your Sun keyboard is
unlikely to work for your Linux machine's keyboard. Jamie
Zawinski's <span   class="bold"><b>xkeycaps</b></span> found at
<a href="http://www.jwz.org/xkeycaps" target="_self">http://www.jwz.org/xkeycaps/</a>
may help; it is a graphical editor for editing keyboard setups
under X. &mdash;Scott Maxwell, s-max@pacbell.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc5d580.0xd565d8"></a>Migrating from Windows</h2></div></div><p>I got interested in Linux through a programme on BBC World.
However, after an afternoon roaming the Internet, I couldn't get an
answer to two questions most laymen probably have on the subject:
does Linux replace Windows on my computer and is the process
irreversible; will I be able to use my Windows-based programmes on
Linux? &mdash;Philippe Humbl&eacute;, humble@mbox1.ufsc.br</p><p>Linux can replace Windows on your computer, or the two can
coexist. If you buy a commercial distribution or a Linux book, it
should help explain how to do this. The process is irreversible
only in the sense that you'll never want to go back. There are
different ways to use your Windows-based software under Linux. A
couple of emulators&mdash;Wine and Wabi&mdash;enable you to run some Windows
software directly under Linux. (Similarly, DOSEMU lets you run DOS
software under Linux.) Other Windows software can be run by
rebooting the machine into Windows, using the software, and then
rebooting into Linux again as soon as possible. As time goes on,
you'll discover Linux software that can partially or entirely
eliminate your need for Windows&mdash;Linux-native word processors,
spreadsheets and such. &mdash;Scott Maxwell, s-max@pacbell.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc5d580.0xd56738"></a>Alternatives to X</h2></div></div><p>I am new to Linux and have heard much about the X Window
System when word processing using Applixware Office or Corel's Word
Perfect for Linux. What if I don't want to use X? Are there quality
office applications that will run without X?&lt;\n&gt;  &mdash;John Tam,
johta@mailexcite.com</p><p>There is not, as far as I know, a non-X integrated office
suite, but many of the pieces exist. For document processing, you
can use TeX. Whether you'll like TeX or not depends on your
needs&mdash;it is rock-solid and extremely powerful, but it is not
WYSIWYG. &mdash;Scott Maxwell, s-max@pacbell.net</p><p>Most people associate &ldquo;quality office applications&rdquo; with
&ldquo;graphical user interface&rdquo;, a &ldquo;what you see is what you get&rdquo;
environment like the current flock of office applications shipping
for Windows machines. On UNIX systems, the standard GUI environment
is the X Window System, so all of the current office suites for
Linux run on top of X. This makes life much easier for the
programmer&mdash;she can concentrate on writing a good word processor
and leave the details of making it &ldquo;graphical&rdquo; to X. Early
versions of X were somewhat tricky to set up and supported only a
small subset of available graphics cards, but the configuration
programs have come a long way as has driver support&mdash;a quick read
of the X HOWTO should leave you with nothing to fear from &ldquo;getting
graphical&rdquo; on your Linux machine. &mdash;Vince Waldon,
