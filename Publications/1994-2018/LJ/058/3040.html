to change passwords regularly. We change passwords often for
security reasons and that's fine. What bothers me is the need to
log in to each machine individually and run the password changing
programs on each one, then log into each individual application
that has its own user and password lists independent of the host
machine and change the passwords there. My office network requires
over thirty such changes; my home network, eight.
</p><p>If I were running only UNIX, then I could use NIS and let
that service change my machine passwords for me. However, NIS
doesn't change non-UNIX passwords and doesn't do anything for
application passwords. The same applies to Windows NT-based
domains, where a central user list is maintained. Domain users
don't extend to UNIX or applications. Utilities exist to provide
some cross-platform support for NIS and NT domains, but I haven't
found one that works well across my mixed network platforms.</p><p>Obviously, this is a problem that has plagued users for
years. The folks at M-Tech (Calgary, Alberta) have done something
about it. M-Tech's solution is called P-Synch (for password
synchronization). It uses a number of scripts and API routines to
perform all the password changes on your network from a single
location. (It is an obvious solution, once you've seen it work.) I
first encountered P-Synch two years ago in an earlier version and
have used it religiously on my own networks, recommended it to many
clients and written about it extensively since. A Linux
implementation of P-Synch was an obvious spinoff of the UNIX
version. Even better, M-Tech has released a new version of P-Synch
which adds several new features that make it more functional and
easier to manage.</p><p>As you may have gathered from the comments above, P-Synch
uses scripts to change passwords on all applications and machines
you tell it to access. P-Synch accomplishes this by using either a
native API or TELNET to log in to each machine or application one
at a time, running whatever commands are necessary to modify the
passwords. You specify only the password to change to (or to reset)
and P-Synch runs through its list of targets in the background.
Since only a single copy of P-Synch is required anywhere on the
network, no client programs need to be installed on each machine.
The user interface can be character-based, GUI or HTML. An
administrator defines which machines and applications a user can
modify passwords on, as well as more advanced options such as
password aging.</p><p>Since P-Synch is script-based, it can change passwords on any
machine or application that can be logged in to using TELNET or for
which an API can be written. The list of M-Tech-provided scripts
for operating systems is lengthy: Linux, many versions of UNIX,
NetWare, Windows 95/98 and NT, LAN Manager, PathWorks, MVS and VMS.
Application scripts available from M-Tech include Oracle, Sybase,
SQL-Server, cc:Mail, MS-Mail, Exchange, GroupWise and GroupWare
(including Lotus Notes). Scripts for other targets are starting to
appear in Usenet newsgroups and on web pages, mostly written by
P-Synch administrators.</p><p>The documentation for P-Synch may be downloaded from the
M-Tech web site in PDF, PS or HTML formats. You can download
uncompressed, ZIP or GZIP versions. The installation and
configuration guide is about 260 pages long, but you will likely
need to examine only a few pages to install P-Synch properly.
Instead of printing the entire document, an Acrobat or PostScript
viewer is best used to find those sections of interest. (Viewing
on-line saves both time and paper.)</p><p>If you are running NIS (or a Windows-based alternative),
P-Synch needs to run on the master. P-Synch will not function
properly if installed on a client of an NIS master. (NIS does not
allow administrative password changes from clients.) If you are not
running NIS or a similar network-wide user management system,
P-Synch can reside on any machine on the network. All machines must
be running TCP/IP. P-Synch can coexist quite happily with NIS,
handling the non-NIS targets only, if you prefer.</p><p>Prior to installing P-Synch, you must gather a list of the IP
addresses of each machine on which P-Synch will change passwords.
P-Synch requires root (or equivalent) access on each of these
machines. It is handy to create a test account or two on the server
and a few clients to make sure P-Synch is performing its tasks
properly before trusting it to your network-wide password
management. These test accounts can be deleted after testing or
saved for other purposes. A complete installation takes about 4MB
of disk space (noticeably down from the last version's requirement
of 9MB).</p><p>Installing P-Synch takes only a few minutes; however,
configuring for a network with several applications and operating
systems can take a while longer. The usual installation procedure
is to copy or download the files to your Linux machine and extract
the files in the library (tar, gzip or zip). One such library file
is called unix_srv.tar and contains binaries for all supported UNIX
and Linux platforms. After extracting this tar file, an
installation shell script is run which handles the file setup
procedure. A manual check of a configuration file to ensure it has
the proper location for the passwd file (by default, it assumes
/etc/passwd) completes the file setup. P-Synch normally uses TCP
port 106, but this can be changed if port 106 is in use by another
service. To test the installation, a TELNET session to the TCP port
should produce a password prompt, at which point the installation
is finished. The installation guide contains a list of common
problems encountered when setting up P-Synch and they should
account for most Linux system configurations.</p><p>P-Synch uses a script called psynch.conf to manage password
changes. Separate parts of the program control users changing their
own passwords, as well as root changing any password. On Linux and
UNIX systems, P-Synch modifies passwords directly by interaction
with the passwd program, not through a script (which would provide
a potential security hole). The psynch.conf script can be edited if
necessary, which makes it easy to handle special requirements such
as firewalls and proxies as well as encryption schemes that manage
password files. For non-UNIX passwords, P-Synch's psynch.conf file
must be modified to use a script for password changes. M-Tech
provides a number of prewritten scripts for different operating
systems as well as applications that reside on UNIX or Windows
machines (such as Oracle, Lotus Notes and so on). Non-UNIX systems
require changes to the inetd file, but these can be cut-and-pasted
from M-Tech's documentation or scripts. Linux and UNIX versions of
P-Synch require a login called psadmin, which is used by the server
to verify that P-Synch agents on other machines are allowed to
change passwords. The psadmin login should be set up so that it has
no access privileges.</p><p>Our test network consisted of three Linux machines (two Red
Hat and one Slackware), four that were SCO OpenServer or UnixWare
and three Windows NT servers, along with twelve Windows 95/98
machines. The server applications were Oracle 8, Lotus Notes,
Exchange, Novell GroupWise and SQL-Server (all on the Windows NT
servers). On this network, installation and configuration of
P-Synch took about two hours. Most of that time was spent setting
up the non-Linux/non-UNIX password change routines, with about half
an hour required to debug the various scripts. If you are working
on a Linux-only network, the process will take less than ten
minutes.</p><p>Once properly configured, users anywhere on the network could
run the P-Synch routines to modify their own passwords. The HTML
interface in particular is friendly and attractive. Users can
specify which machines or applications the change affects, or
accept all (the usual case). Administrators can change passwords
from any client. The amount of time required for a password change
depends on the network load, the number of targets and the nature
of the operating systems. On our test network, the password changes
went quickly, completing in under two minutes.</p><p>To test P-Synch with NIS, we set up one of the SCO machines
as an NIS master and a Red Hat Linux system as the slave. We let
NIS handle the password changes on half of the UNIX and Linux
machines while P-Synch handled the rest of those types as well as
the Windows machines. Propagation time for password changes didn't
drop noticeably, which was expected since the Windows and
application scripts are the major time consumers.</p><p>P-Synch is usually licensed to networks based on the number
of users. M-Tech will customize the pricing plan to suit your
requirements. Earlier versions of P-Synch cost about $10 per user;
the latest version is likely to be similarly priced. If you don't
want to worry about the password-changing hassle anymore, you'll
find P-Synch to be a wonderful utility. It is fast, clean, easy to
use and worth every penny. The benefits are multiplied many-fold on
heterogenous networks. If you want more information about P-Synch,
or want to download the application itself for evaluation, check
out the M-Tech Web site at http://www.m-tech.ab.ca/. For the
curious, a white paper describing P-Synch is available in Acrobat
PDF and PostScript formats.</p></div></div>
