    How Casper College uses Linux to teach computer science courses.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2231f1.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x133c580.0x1434608"></a></h2></div></div><p> Casper College is located in the city of
Casper, Wyoming. Its total enrollment stands at about 4,000, with
students coming from Wyoming, 26 other states and 9 foreign
countries. You can visit Casper College's home page at
http://www.cc.whecn.edu/.
</p><p>The college uses several Unix systems for e-mail, web
services, student records and accounting. At present, the bulk of
teaching is done using personal computers running Windows 95, which
are networked together with Novell Netware. Netscape is available
on most machines.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x133c580.0x1434768"></a>A Brief History</h2></div></div><p>Casper College first used Linux as a teaching tool during the
Spring 1995 semester when Ralph Anderl taught a short
&ldquo;Introduction to Unix&rdquo; class. At first, Ralph used an SCO host,
and later switched to a Linux host. Ralph worried that Linux might
lock up when two dozen students simultaneously accessed it. His
worry changed to amazement after Linux proved it could easily
handle two dozen students and more. Linux found a home at Casper
College and Ralph named the new Linux host &ldquo;breeze&rdquo;.</p><p>Why breeze? Well, Casper sees a lot of wind. Sometimes
airline pilots come to Casper in order to train in windy
conditions. The wind blows new pilots miles off course during
landings, and even experienced pilots find it difficult to touch
down smoothly. So, in honor of its wind, Casper College gives its
hosts names such as: &ldquo;wind&rdquo;, &ldquo;breeze&rdquo; and &ldquo;dust&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x133c580.0x14348c8"></a>Present Uses</h2></div></div><p>LISP and C programming classes are taught directly on breeze
by using a TELNET session on each student's computer. Other classes
use home accounts on breeze as a private area where students can
send and receive computer files containing handouts, tests and
assignments.</p><p>I teach a class named &ldquo;Computer Information Systems&rdquo;, which
introduces students to PC hardware, Windows 95 and applications
such as PowerPoint. This is the first computer class for many
students. Normally, e-mail is the best method to transfer tests,
assignments and handouts between instructors and students. However,
in this particular class, most students lack an e-mail account. So
I set up a system that allows students to send and receive files
using Netscape.</p><p>The first step involved setting up a web server on breeze. We
used a CERN server at first and later switched to an Apache server.
At this point, instructors could publish public course materials
such as syllabi, HOWTOs and tests on Casper College's Intranet.
However, ensuring private communication between instructors and
students required a bit more work.</p><p>To ensure privacy, we created a breeze user account for each
student which was readable only by the student. That allowed
instructors, as root, to place confidential information such as
test scores in each student's home directory. It also allowed
students to send homework, assignments and tests to a private
place.</p><p>Classroom experience taught me that students new to computers
absolutely must use a web browser to transfer files. Although new
students take to a GUI interface like a fish to water, a console
interface such as FTP stops them dead in their tracks.</p><p>Fortunately, students can transfer files to or from their
home directories using Netscape and opening a URL, such as
ftp://don@breeze.</p><p>This causes Netscape to prompt for a password, then allows
the user (in this case, Don) to access files in his home directory.
To make things convenient we create mime types for Access, Excel,
Lotus, PowerPoint, Schedule, Word and WordPerfect file types. We
then add Netscape helper applications to each Windows 95 PC. Now,
when a student clicks on a Lotus file, Netscape will automatically
start up a Lotus application using the file as input.</p><p>Students take tests by using the Edit Document feature in
Netscape Gold. This method provides the added benefit of giving
them some practical experience with modifying web pages.</p><p>Remember that &ldquo;Introduction to Unix&rdquo; class I mentioned at
the start of this article? Now Ralph uses Linux exclusively to
teach the class. He also teaches out of a book which comes with its
very own Linux CD-ROM. One class period is devoted to installing
Linux on the personal computers in the lab. Many students also
install Linux on their home computers. The UMSDOS file system comes
in handy for students who are new to hard drive partitions, because
it allows them to install Linux into a familiar file system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x133c580.0x1434c90"></a>The Future</h2></div></div><p>Casper College starts a new four-year Computer Science degree
program during the Fall 1997 semester. You can bet that the
presence of Linux will grow even stronger.</p></div></div>
