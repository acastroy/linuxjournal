    Here's a way to filter unwanted mail using procmail.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1566580.0x165e3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you regularly receive a high volume of
mail (e.g., you subscribe to several mailing lists) or are the
target of unsolicited bulk e-mail (UBE), mail filtering may have
crossed your mind. <span   class="bold"><b>procmail</b></span> is a
flexible tool that allows you to process incoming e-mail and
perform user-definable actions, such as filtering, prioritizing or
informing you of new mail.
<span   class="bold"><b>procmail</b></span> is part of a larger
toolset that also includes
<span   class="bold"><b>formail</b></span>, a program that can handle
tasks such as recognizing duplicate messages, digest bursting,
header extraction/addition and the generation of auto-replies.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1566580.0x165e608"></a>Setting It Up</h2></div></div><p>If you do not have procmail on your system already, you can
pick up the latest copy at
ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.gz.
The current version as of this writing is 3.11pre7. (Don't let the
&ldquo;pre&rdquo; scare you; this version is very stable.) The package
compiles out-of-the-box for Linux, but you may want to change a few
compilation parameters (like installing into /usr/local instead of
/usr). Read the INSTALL file included in the archive to get the
complete installation process.</p><p>Once you have compiled and installed procmail, you can start
using it. Since it is designed to process incoming mail, you need
to modify your ~/.forward file (or create one if you do not have
one) to include the following line that will automatically invoke
procmail:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
"|IFS=' '&amp;&amp;/usr/local/bin/procmail -f-||exit 75 #
</pre><p>Include all quotes and do change
<span   class="emphasis"><em>YOUR_LOGIN_NAME</em></span>. The reason for doing this is
described in the FAQ that is bundled with the archive. Next, you
will need to create a <span   class="emphasis"><em>recipe file</em></span> that
procmail will use to filter your mail.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1566580.0x165e8c8"></a>procmail Usage</h2></div></div><p>When executed, one of the things procmail does is look for a
file called .procmailrc in your home directory. This file holds all
of the commands, called recipes, that tell procmail what to do with
the incoming mail. A recipe has three parts: the start
(<b  >:0</b>, followed by optional flags and local
lockfile), the optional conditions and the action to be taken if
the conditions evaluate out to true. Each part of a recipe is on a
separate line.</p><p>The flags tell procmail which part of the message to look at
(headers, body or both) and whether the recipe is a delivering
(terminating) or non-delivering recipe. The local lockfile ensures
that concurrently running procmail processes do not interfere with
each other when writing out to a mailbox and should be used only
for delivering recipes. The optional conditions start with an
<b  >*</b> (asterisk). There can be more than one
condition or no conditions as you feel necessary. Everything
proceeding the <b  >*</b> is passed to an internal
regular expression (regex) engine, which is compatible with
<span   class="bold"><b>egrep</b></span>. All conditions are
logically ANDed together. If you choose to have no conditions,
procmail defaults to a true result (which is what you would
expect). The action line tells procmail what action to take if the
all the conditions match. The action line can start with a
<b  >!</b> (to forward the message), a
<b  >|</b> (to pass the message to a program), or a
<b  >{</b> (to start a nested block). Anything else is
taken to be a mailbox name.</p><p>Here is an example of a recipe that will filter all mail
coming from the Whitehouse into a mailbox of the same name:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
:0:
  * ^From: .*whitehouse\.gov
  whitehouse
</pre><p>Let's analyze this one line at a time. The first line tells
procmail that we have started a recipe (<b  >:0</b>) and
that we want procmail to determine the local lockfile (the second
<b  >:</b>). The next line is the condition that procmail
must match in order for this recipe to be true. By default,
procmail scans only the headers, which is what we want. The last
line is the action, which tells procmail to write the message to a
file called whitehouse.
</p><p>For contrast, here is a non-delivering recipe:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
:0 f
  * ^X-Face:
  | formail "I X-Face"
</pre><p>This one uses <span   class="bold"><b>formail</b></span> to
strip out an unwanted X-Face header. Notice the lack of a local
lockfile. Since this is a filter, a lockfile is unnecessary.
<span   class="bold"><b>procmail</b></span> will still work if you
place one there, but it will complain.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1566580.0x165f000"></a>Unsolicited Mail</h2></div></div><p>At the beginning of this article, I mentioned that procmail
is useful to filter unwanted mail. UBE (or spam as it is more
commonly known) has become an annoying trend and a nuisance. The
volume of spam is believed to have increased substantially on
Usenet, where people excessively post the same message to various
newsgroups. Usenet spam is perceived to be &ldquo;cancellable&rdquo;, meaning
a posted message can be deleted by the moderator before being read
by too many people. To get around this type of cancellation,
someone got the idea to send the message to you directly rather
than posting it to Usenet where it might be deleted before you read
it. Hence, UBE started to infiltrate users' in-boxes. Pioneers of
this form of marketing quickly found out that many users disliked
spam in any form, and often found their own mailboxes full of
flames. They started to obscure headers to make it hard to find out
where the message really came from.</p><p>Why is spam considered the bane of the Internet at large?
Unlike the junk mail you receive in your postal box at home,
spammers rarely pay as much to send the spam as the recipient does
to receive it. The fact that they pay less than you is called
&ldquo;cost-shifting&rdquo;. Another form of this shifting is the use of
third-party computer resources by the spammer for sending their
bulk e-mail without permission. By doing so, the spammer is costing
that innocent company both time and money spent to clean up after
the spammer. Another tactic widely used is the munging of the
headers in such a way that uneducated recipients may waste the time
of innocent third parties who had nothing to do with the spam in
the first place. This type of deceitfulness can also be considered
cost-shifting and has been ruled illegal in the U.S. Courts.</p><p>Cost-shifting is not the only argument against spam. There is
no single removal point as each spammer generally runs their own
list. To that end, they are not required to honor a removal list.
As more and more people send spam, you will never be able to remove
your address from every single list. Why should you have to if you
didn't ask for it in the first place? Finally, a great deal of the
spam is or could be considered illegal, such as pyramid schemes,
multi-level marketing schemes and lotteries.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1566580.0x165f1b8"></a>Dealing with UBE</h2></div></div><p>Rather than having all that garbage clog up your in-box and
make it unusable for real work, you can now use procmail to filter
it out. Earlier I mentioned that spammers try to obscure headers to
make it hard to trace. By doing so, they sometimes give inadvertent
&ldquo;signatures&rdquo; that you can tell procmail to filter on. For
instance, a popular bulk e-mailer, the Stealth Mailer, inserts a
false Received: line to deter flames. However, both versions
generate the wrong time zone. Armed with this knowledge, you can
now filter out a great deal of spam. I have yet to see a false
positive on this one.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Filter spam that used the Stealth Mailer Classic
  :0
  * ^Received:.*id GAA.*-0600 \(EST\)$
  spam
</pre><p>Another great spam filter looks for a &ldquo;Comments:
Authenticated sender is&rdquo; header. Unfortunately, filtering on that
alone does not do the trick because Pegasus Mail (a popular mail
client for the Windows operating system) uses this header
legitimately. Fortunately, Pegasus adds an X-Mailer: header in
addition to the Comments: header. If both the Comments: and the
X-Mailer: exist, then a Pegasus Mail user sent the message (and is
probably legitimate); otherwise, it is a bulk mailer. The following
recipe will filter this situation. (Note that there is a space and
a tab between the square brackets. Unfortunately, procmail does not
have a whitespace escape sequence as Perl does.)
<pre     class="programlisting">
# Only Pegasus Mail for the WinOS generates a
# valid "Comments: Authenticated sender is ..."
# header. If this is present and the X-Mailer is
# not; then the message in the question is almost
# certainly spam.
:0
* ^Comments:[   ]*Authenticated sender
* !^X-Mailer: Pegasus Mail
spam
</pre>


These two recipes alone filter out a majority of my spam. You can
quickly see that a list of these recipes strung together would be
beneficial. This is exactly what several free packages have done.
My personal choice came down to Alcor's filters
(http://alcor.concordia.ca/topics/email/auto/procmail/spam), which
I found to be non-intrusive, easy to understand and quite flexible.
Alcor's filters work by applying over 1300 filters to the message.
If a filter is matched, the message is tagged with a special
header. Then, all you have to do is take whatever action (e.g.,
delete, write sender, etc.) you deem appropriate for these messages
with the special headers. I personally avoid &ldquo;reply&rdquo; because I
dislike using auto-responders, and &ldquo;delete&rdquo; because I believe in
checking for false positives (of which you will unavoidably get a
few).
</p><p>I recommend downloading all of the tag recipes (use the
&ldquo;save as source&rdquo; [not text] feature on your browser). I placed
the filters in a new directory, cleverly called ~/.procmail. You
will most likely need to edit the file
<b  >tag-radical</b> in order to comment out (using a #
at the beginning of the line) or change the three uncommented
<b  >INCLUDERC</b> lines. Otherwise, you will see
annoying &ldquo;Couldn't read xxxx&rdquo; errors in your $LOGFILE each time
you process a message. Once that is done, add the following recipe
in your ~/.procmailrc at the point you wish to check the incoming
message for spam. I check mine at the very top before I do any kind
of filtering and have found that this works well.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p>That is all. If everything goes well, you should notice that
most (if not all) of your spam now goes into your mailbox named
spam. You can test it by sending a message to yourself that
contains content that these filters will catch (try sending
yourself a message with <b  >-- Headers --</b> somewhere
in the body).

not recommend deleting anything before you look at it. Once you
have verified that it is spam, you have two options: complain or
delete. If you want to fight spam, I recommend you to read the
SPAM-L FAQ (http://www.ot.com/~dmuth/spam-l/) and possibly join the
mailing list. Instructions on how to do so are in the FAQ.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1566580.0x165f6e0"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>This article is only the tip of the iceberg on using procmail
and its accompanying programs. If you are interested in the
continued use of procmail to filter your e-mail, I recommend the
procmail mailing list. The regulars there are knowledgable and
willing to help. You may also want to search out other procmail
solutions. To put these filters through a stress test and to help
further develop them, I have subscribed to a special mailing list
that sends nothing but spam that is forwarded through it, which
takes special care to try and filter duplicates. At the time of
this writing, 83% of mail I have received from this list was
properly filtered.</p><p><a href="2623s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="2623s2.html" target="_self">Acknowledgements</a></p></div></div>
