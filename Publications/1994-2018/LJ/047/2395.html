    SANE makes it easy to support a wide variety of devices and
    of applications with a minimum amount of programming effort.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc80580.0xd783a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>SANE stands for &ldquo;Scanner Access Now
Easy&rdquo;. It is a universal interface that enables you to acquire
images from any device that produces raster images, including
flatbed scanners, video and still cameras and frame grabbers. The
intent of SANE is to make it possible to write image-processing
applications without having to worry about peculiarities of
individual devices. Looking at it from the other side, SANE makes
it possible to write a device driver once and only once. That same
device driver can then be used by any SANE-compliant application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc80580.0xd784a8"></a>Introduction to SANE</h2></div></div><p>Have you ever wanted to scan an image under Linux? If so, you
probably know the feeling of being faced by a bewildering number of
scanner-driver packages. At the time of this writing, at least
fourteen different scanner packages exist for Linux. While each
individual package is usually of high quality, it is often
difficult to determine which package should be used for which
scanner. Furthermore, some packages come with a command-line
interface, others include Tcl/Tk based graphical front ends, still
others come with full-featured, graphical front ends. While variety
is said to make life sweet, in this case it's more likely to cause
a sizeable headache.</p><p>SANE was created to provide a solution to this dilemma. The
basic idea is simple: if there was a general and well-defined
application programming interface (API), it would be easy to write
applications independently from scanner drivers. Thus, the author
of a new scanner driver would not have to worry about writing an
application for the driver. There are benefits for the application
programmer as well; since SANE is universal, an application can be
written independently of the devices that it will eventually
control. Suppose we wanted five applications to support ten
different devices. With the old approach, 5*10=50 programs would
have to be written. With SANE, only 5+10=15 programs have to be
written. SANE has advantages for the user too. It gives the user
the liberty to choose whichever application he likes best, and that
one application can be used to control all image-acquisition
devices the user can access. Thus, SANE makes it possible to
present the same consistent interface independent of the particular
device that is in use.</p><p>Of course, SANE is not the first attempt to create such a
universal interface. You may have heard of TWAIN, PINT or the Linux
hand-scanner interface. The problem is that these older interfaces
prove to be lacking in one way or another. For example, PINT is
really a somewhat primitive kernel-level interface and the
hand-scanner interface by definition is limited to hand-scanners.
In contrast, SANE is general enough to support any device that
acquires raster images. The closest thing to SANE is probably
TWAIN. The fact that the two rhyme is not coincidental, but that's
a different story. The main reason TWAIN is not SANE is that TWAIN
puts the graphical user interface to control the device in the
driver instead of the application. This makes it unsuitable for
Linux or networked environments where the scanner driver might run
on one machine and the application on another. In contrast, SANE
enforces a strict separation between the actual driver and the
user-interface for its controls. Indeed, the current SANE
distribution includes support for network-transparent
scanning.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc80580.0xd78660"></a>Using SANE</h2></div></div><p>To start using SANE, fetch the latest version of the
distribution from the ftp directory
ftp://ftp.mostang.com/pub/sane/.</p><p>If you want to build the graphical-user-interface programs
that come with SANE, you will also need to fetch, build and install
the GIMP or, at a minimum, the GTK distribution. Both GIMP and GTK
are available at ftp://ftp.gimp.org/. GTK is the user-interface
toolkit that originally has been developed for the GIMP, but is now
being adopted by many other projects, including SANE. Note that the
SANE distribution will build just fine without the GIMP/GTK
libraries. However, that way none of the nice
graphical-user-interface programs will be built, thus taking away
much of the fun. So, unless you are building SANE for a server
only, I recommend that you install at least GTK, if not
GIMP.</p><p>After fetching the SANE distribution, unpack the compressed
tar file and follow the instructions in the README file. The README
explains how to build and install SANE. Also, take a look at the
file called PROBLEMS; it contains a list of known problems and
their work arounds.</p><p>Note that you don't have to own a scanner or a camera to play
with SANE. The distribution includes a pseudo-driver that simulates
a scanner by reading portable &ldquo;anymap&rdquo; (PNM) files. Also, SANE is
not limited to Linux. Besides Linux for Alpha, x86 and m68k, it
includes support for AIX, Digital Unix, FreeBSD, HP-UX, IRIX,
NetBSD, SCO, Solaris, SunOS and even OS/2.</p><p>After installing SANE, you should be able to type the
command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
scanimage --list-devices
</pre><p>and get the output shown below:
<pre     class="programlisting">
device `mustek:/dev/scanner' is a Mustek MFC-06000CZ flatbed scanner
device `pnm:0' is a Noname PNM file reader virtual device
device `pnm:1' is a Noname PNM file reader virtual device
</pre>


As the listing shows, in this particular case, a Mustek scanner is
available under name mustek:/dev/scanner and two fake devices
called pnm:0 and pnm:1 are available that can be used to read PNM
files. To get list of all options for a particular device, for
example pnm:0, simply type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
scanimage --device pnm:0 --help
</pre>


This will produce the help message shown in
<a href="2395l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>.
</p><p>The SANE package comes with a detailed man page that explains
the specifics of the <span   class="bold"><b>scanimage</b></span>
program. As an example, suppose we had a PPM file named input.ppm.
We can use the scanimage program to &ldquo;scan&rdquo; that image and
increase its brightness by 50% using the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
scanimage --device pnm --brightness
50 input.ppm &gt; out.pnm
</pre><p>If you look at file out.pnm with an image viewer such as xv,
you should be able to see that output.ppm is noticeably brighter.
</p><p>You may say: cool, but where is the graphical user interface?
Assuming you had the GTK libraries installed when SANE was built,
you can invoke a program called
<span   class="bold"><b>xscanimage</b></span> that will present you
with a dialog box containing a list of available devices. If you
double-click on the &ldquo;pnm:0&rdquo; entry, you'll get the dialog shown in
Figure 1. As you can see, the dialog includes two text-entry boxes
labeled &ldquo;Filename&rdquo; and a slider labelled &ldquo;Brightness&rdquo;. If you
enter &ldquo;out.pnm&rdquo; in the first text-entry box and &ldquo;input.ppm&rdquo; in
the second box and move the brightness slider to 50.0, you can
press the Scan button at the bottom left and get the same result as
with the scanimage command line shown above. Of course, before
doing the actual scanning, you could press the Preview button at
the bottom right to pop up a preview window (see Figure 2). In the
preview window, you can push the Acquire&lt;\!s&gt;Preview button
to obtain a low-resolution preview of the final image. For example,
by moving the brightness slider around, you can see how the
brightness of the image is affected. After moving the slider,
you'll need to press the Acquire Preview button to get an updated
preview.</p><p><a href="2395f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. SANE
Dialog Window</b></span></a></p><p><a href="2395f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2. SANE
Preview Window</b></span></a></p><p>When scanning an image with a real scanner or camera, you'll
usually want to enhance it in various ways, such as making it
appear sharper. The nice thing about the xscanimage program is that
it can also be run as a GIMP extension. To do this, simply create a
symlink from the GIMP plug-ins directory to the xscanimage binary.
Assuming the SANE installation defaults, you could do this with the
following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ln -s /usr/local/bin/xscanimage ~/.gimp/plug-ins
</pre><p>After making this link, xscanimage will attach itself to the
GIMP's &ldquo;Xtns&rdquo; menu the next time you start it. This makes it
possible to invoke, for example, the PNM pseudo-device by selecting
&ldquo;Xtns<b  >-&gt;</b>Acquire
Image<b  >-&gt;</b>pnm:0&rdquo;. When invoked in this manner,
pressing the Scan button will put the newly scanned image inside a
GIMP window (instead of saving it to disk). Now, the usual GIMP
image-manipulation functions can be used to enhance the acquired
image before saving it.
</p><p><a href="2395f1.jpg" target="_self">2395f1.gif</a></p><p>Figure 3. Mustek Dialog Window for xscanimage</p><p>The PNM pseudo-device may be fun, but what does a real
scanner interface look like? Figure 3 shows the xscanimage dialog
as it appears for Mustek flatbed scanners. The figure also
demonstrates another feature of xscanimage: tool tips (also known
as &ldquo;balloon help&rdquo;). Tool tips make it easier for new users to get
acquainted with the capabilities of their scanner or camera. In the
figure, the mouse points to the Scan&lt;\!s&gt;Source menu and, as
a result, the help information for that menu is shown in the yellow
box below the mouse pointer. Tool tips are handy for new users, but
after a while, they tend to get in your way. Thus, xscanimage
allows advanced users to turn off the tool tips using the
Preferences sub-menu.</p><p>As you can see, the Mustek dialog looks quite different from
the PNM pseudo-device interface. This is because the underlying
devices have different capabilities. In fact, the device dialog
depends not only on the selected device, but also on the mode of
the device. For example, when turning on the &ldquo;Use custom gamma
table&rdquo; option near the bottom of the dialog, the interface
changes, and the result is shown in Figure 4. As you can see, the
right half of the dialog now contains a graph editor that allows
the user to modify the intensity, red, green or blue gamma table.
In other words, xscanimage displays precisely the options that are
active or meaningful for a given scan mode, greatly reducing the
likelihood of confusing the user.</p><p><a href="2395f2.jpg" target="_self">2395f2.gif</a></p><p>Figure 4. Mustek Dialog With Gamma Table Editor</p><p>Looking at the image-intensity gamma table in the right half
of the figure, you can probably imagine that it would be rather
annoying to define the gamma tables each time you started
xscanimage. Once the ideal tables have been found, it would be nice
if it were possible to save them. For this purpose, xscanimage
allows saving the current device settings through an entry in the
Preferences sub-menu. Once saved, whenever xscanimage is started,
it automatically restores the last saved option values for that
device.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc80580.0xd79370"></a>What Else Comes with SANE?</h2></div></div><p>Now that you have seen how to use some of the programs that
come with the SANE distribution, it is time to tell you what else
is included. At the time of this writing, the package includes
drivers for the following devices:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Connectix QuickCam (color and monochrome)</p></li><li><p>Some Epson SCSI scanners</p></li><li><p>Hewlett-Packard ScanJet SCSI scanners</p></li><li><p>Microtek SCSI scanners</p></li><li><p>Mustek SCSI flatbed scanners (both one-pass and
three-pass scanners are supported)</p></li><li><p>PINT devices: PINT is a Unix-kernel interface for
NetBSD, OpenBSD and SunOS. SANE's PINT driver provides access to
any scanner for which there is PINT support</p></li><li><p>Most UMAX SCSI scanners</p></li></ul></div><p>Support for many other scanners and cameras is planned and
some of them should be ready by the time you read this article. For
the latest information, please visit the web page listed in the
Resources.</p><p>Available applications are the command-line
<span   class="bold"><b>scanimage</b></span>, the graphical
<span   class="bold"><b>xscanimage</b></span> (either stand-alone or
as a GIMP extension) and <span   class="bold"><b>xcam</b></span>, a
graphical user interface suitable for cameras which produce a
continuous stream of images (such as the Connectix
QuickCam).</p><p>In addition, there are SANE API bindings for Python and Java
API and a network daemon called
<span   class="bold"><b>saned</b></span> that provides
network-transparent access to remote devices. Assuming you have the
appropriate permissions, this makes it possible to control a camera
running in the U.S. from a machine running in Europe&mdash;all courtesy
of SANE and the Internet.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc80580.0xd79c08"></a>How Does It Work?</h2></div></div><p>When building a SANE application, it must be linked against
the shared library called libsane.so. In reality, libsane.so is
just a symlink to one of the SANE drivers. Since every SANE driver
exports the exact same interface, you can change the libsane.so
symlink at any time and effectively change which driver the
application is using. While this is useful in the sense that it
allows upgrading to a different driver without having to relink all
the applications, it would not be very convenient if you had to
change a symlink whenever you wished to switch the scanning device.
For this reason, SANE supports two pseudo-drivers called
<span   class="bold"><b>dll</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>net</b></span>. They are pseudo-drivers
because rather than talking to physical devices, they talk to other
SANE drivers, as illustrated in Figure 5.</p><p>For machine A, the libsane.so symlink points to the dll
pseudo-driver (called libsane-dll.so). That pseudo-driver uses
dynamically linked libraries (dll) to access other SANE drivers. In
the example, dll is configured to use the pnm, mustek and net
drivers. The net driver is again a pseudo-driver; it provides
access to remote scanners by connecting to the SANE daemon (saned)
running on machine B. Machine B in turn uses dll again to provide
access to a variety of other drivers. As you might imagine, the
exact configuration is entirely up to the system administrator(s)
of machines A and B. It is fairly typical to have libsane.so be a
symlink to the dll pseudo-driver, but there is no reason it
couldn't point to the net pseudo-driver or just the mustek driver.
Of course, in the latter case the implication would be that
applications could access the mustek driver only&mdash;but that's
perfectly reasonable for certain environments.</p><p><a href="2395f5.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 5.
Possible SANE Hierarchy</b></span></a></p><p>This approach is very flexible, but it raises an interesting
question: how do we name devices in such an environment? The answer
is that every real driver has its own device name space. For
example, the Mustek and HP drivers use the path for the Unix
special device that controls the device, such as /dev/scanner. With
pseudo-drivers, things get a bit more interesting. Since dll must
guarantee that each device name is unique, it simply prefixes the
name of each subordinate device with the name of the subordinate
driver, separated by a colon. Thus, on machine A, the mustek
scanner would be called mustek:/dev/scanner. The net pseudo-driver
does something similar: it prefixes the remote device name with the
remote host name (again using a colon as a separator). For example,
HP scanner 1 on machine B would appear on machine A under the name
net:B.domain.com:hp:/dev/scanner1. While this doesn't make for the
world's prettiest names, the information contained in the names is
actually quite useful. In essence, much like a Unix path name, the
device names convey the path through the SANE hierarchy that leads
to a particular device. For example, if you know that machine B is
down, it's pretty obvious that net:B.domain.com:hp:/dev/scanner1
will be down as well. If someone feels strongly about these names,
it is possible for an application to let a user or system
administrator define aliases that are more concise. For example, an
application could let a user rename the above device to &ldquo;HP
Scanner 1&rdquo;, which may be easier for beginners.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc80580.0xd70808"></a>Programming With SANE</h2></div></div><p>By definition, SANE is only as good as the programs that use
it. This means the more applications and the more devices that use
SANE, the merrier. The SANE distribution comes with a detailed
document that explains the SANE API; however, the interface is
quite simple. The six main functions are listed below:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>handle <b  >&lt;-</b>
<span   class="bold"><b>sane_open</b></span>(<span   class="emphasis"><em>device-name</em></span>)
allows you to open a SANE device by name (e.g., pnm:0).</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>sane_close</b></span>(handle)
allows you to close a SANE device by name.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>sane_get_option_descriptor</b></span>(handle,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>option-number</em></span>) is used to query the controls
available to the device (such as the brightness control in the PNM
pseudo-device driver).</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>sane_control_option</b></span>(handle,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>option-number</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>action</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>value</em></span>) is used to get or set the value of an
option. For example, it can be used to set the value of the
brightness option to 50 percent. In addition, some options support
an auto-mode where the driver picks a reasonable value. For such
options, sane_control_option() can also be used to turn auto-mode
on or off.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>sane_start</b></span>(handle)
is used to start the acquisition of an image.</p></li><li><p>bytes-read <b  >&lt;-</b>
<span   class="bold"><b>sane_read</b></span>(handle,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>buffer</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>buffer-size</em></span>) is
used to read the actual image data until the entire image has been
acquired.</p></li></ol></div><p>The SANE API is simple by design. The goal was to make it
possible to accomplish a simple task in a small amount of time
while still providing enough functionality to enable sophisticated
drivers and applications. The simplicity is best evidenced by the
fact that it took just two evening sessions to convert the
<span   class="bold"><b>hpscanpbm</b></span> program into a SANE
driver for HP scanners. On the other end of the spectrum, the
Mustek driver and xscanimage are fairly complicated programs and
SANE had no problems accommodating them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc80580.0xd71360"></a>SANE and Commercial Applications/Drivers</h2></div></div><p>What's our position with respect to commercial SANE drivers
or applications? In the spirit of the GNU Public License, it is
preferrable to have the source for SANE programs available.
However, it is permissible to write a dynamically loaded,
commercial SANE driver on Linux and other platforms that support
dynamic loading. (Drivers are always dynamically loaded, so this
doesn't cause any extra work.) By the same token, it is also proper
to write a commercial application that links with the libsane.so
shared library. The basic ideas supporting this position
are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Healthy competition between commercial and free
programs is an asset, not a liability.</p></li><li><p>The more wide-spread use SANE finds, the better for
the Linux/Unix community.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc80580.0xd71620"></a>Future Plans</h2></div></div><p>In the immediate future, the plan is to add support for many
more devices. For example, Agfa and Plustek scanner and Nikon
filmscanner drivers are planned, and there is hope that drivers for
some of the more popular digital cameras will materialize soon as
well. To get the ultimate in network connectivity, there are also
plans to implement a scanner application in Java, making it
possible to control your scanner from your favorite Java-enabled
web browser.</p><p>In the long term, it would be interesting to generalize SANE
to embrace other multimedia devices including audio sources or
video tape recorders.</p><p>In other words, SANE has just started, and there are many
exciting projects to come. If you're interested in pursuing some of
these by all means get in touch with other developers through the
SANE mailing list (see Resources).</p><p><a href="2395s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="2395s2.html" target="_self">Acknowledgements</a></p></div></div>
