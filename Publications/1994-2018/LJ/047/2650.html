mouse&rdquo; control (a fast motion of the mouse moves the mouse a lot
while a slow motion moves the mouse very little). I'm using Metro-X
but seem to recall the same limitation with XFree.</p><p>Is there a patch or parameter available which will enable a
mouse to respond to the speed of the mouse movement? I'm running at
a fairly high resolution and I have to pick my mouse up two or
three times to move the cursor from one side of the screen to the
other. &mdash;Mike Hall</p><p>You can do this using the <b  >m</b> option of the
<span   class="bold"><b>xset</b></span> command. This command lets
you set parameters for both acceleration and a threshold for the
number of pixels the mouse must travel before it accelerates. Check
out the xset man page. &mdash;Samuel Ockman &amp; Larry Augustin, VA

the root &ldquo;/&rdquo; directory. I have a <span   class="emphasis"><em>file</em></span> named
&ldquo;..&rdquo;. This is in addition to the normal directories &ldquo;.&rdquo; and
&ldquo;..&rdquo;. How do I delete a &mdash;Kevbo</p><p>The file cannot truly be called &ldquo;..&rdquo; because the &ldquo;..&rdquo;
directory is present. Its name is probably &ldquo;.. &rdquo; (with a trailing
space) or something similar. The problem here is finding the name
of the file so you'll be able to remove it. Try typing the command
<b  >ls -l &gt; listfile</b> and then look in listfile
with a binary capable editor like Emacs, or use the &ldquo;set list&rdquo;
command in vi to show the end of line, and trailing blanks will be
revealed. Then, using double quotes or wildcard characters
(expressions like &ldquo;..?&rdquo;), you'll be able to identify the file on
the command line and remove it.</p><p>Other files that are often hard to remove are those beginning
with a minus sign. (For example a file named &ldquo;-test&rdquo;). To remove
these files just use a relative pathname, e.g., &mdash;Alessandro

with a P200 MMX and USB support. When I try to autoboot from a
CD-ROM the system starts loading Linux but then suddenly reboots
with error messages like &ldquo;Unknown PCI-device&rdquo;. I can only install
Slackware from a boot disk when I press PAUSE a few times while
loading the image. What can I do about this? &mdash;Mario Vos Red Hat
2.0.0</p><p>Most likely the kernel you are trying to boot can't deal with
your PCI controller. Sometimes, though, a system prints what
appears to be an error message but works anyway. Make sure you
aren't just seeing what you think are errors and not giving it a
chance to work.</p><p>If there truly are errors the best thing to do is to try a
more recent version of Red Hat (4.2 currently). &mdash;Donnie Barnes, Red

what version(s) must I use and what are the configuration
requirements? &mdash;Don Skillen Caldera 2.0.29</p><p>Make sure your kernel has been compiled with these
options:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>IP: multicasting</em></span></p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>IP:

is running Linux Slackware 2.0.30 and the other is running Windows
95. I've configured <span   class="bold"><b>Sendmail</b></span> on my
Linux machine. I use a Netscape mailer on the Win95 machine. When I
send mail between the two machines Sendmail takes a very long time
to send the mail even though it's just a test mail. The mail coming
from Netscape to the Linux box is turbo fast. &mdash;Ronneil
Camara Slackware 3.3</p><p>Your machine is most likely trying to do a reverse DNS lookup
to determine the host name of the machine from which you are
connecting. The delay you are experiencing is the time waiting for
the DNS response. On the Linux box, run the &ldquo;host&rdquo; command with
the IP number of your Windows 95 machine. It should return the name
of the Windows 95 machine. If it doesn't, your name server setup is
not correct.</p><p>If you don't have an external name server (provided by your
ISP), and don't want to create your own, make sure that the daemon
<span   class="bold"><b>named</b></span> is not running on your Linux
machine; confirm this by typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ps ax | egrep -i named
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Next add an entry for the Windows machine to the
/etc/hosts file.</em></span>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>If you are running named, check its setup. You
should run reverse DNS to map IP numbers to host names.</em></span>
The Network Administrator's Guide by Olaf Kirch is freely available
and is a good guide to setting up a name server.</p><p>If your Internet service provider is providing the name
server, make sure your /etc/resolv.conf file correctly points to
your ISP's name server, and talk to your ISP to make sure they are
correctly providing reverse DNS. &mdash;Larry Augustin, VA

  do I install them? &mdash;Michael Hall</p><p>Linux is best installed from a distribution, which is a
collection of usable kernels, software and utilities. Distributions
generally have decent installation programs that allow you to set
up and install the packages that come with them.</p><p>There are many distributions, such as Slackware, Red Hat,
Debian and others. If you are new to Linux and have no Unix
experience, you may wish to buy a book on Linux since that book
will come with a Linux CD and easy installation
instructions.</p><p>If you want to do this on your own, visit the primary Linux
FTP site, http://sunsite.unc.edu/, or a mirror of this site. Look
in the /pub/Linux/distributions directory. Each distribution has
different requirements and installation procedures, so you will
have to look for README (and other) files there.</p><p>For experienced computer users who want to get into Linux
without a book, I recommend Slackware. It can be installed from
almost any media, even DOS-formatted floppy disks, and it's
somewhat easier to figure out than other distributions when you go
it alone. &mdash;Chad Robinson, BRT Technologies chadr@brt.com</p></div></div>
