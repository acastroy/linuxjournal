    In part 2 of our series we learn how to design and code
    network daemons to serve our clients well.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb3b580.0xc33870"></a></h2></div></div><p>Daemon processes are servers which run in
the background servicing various clients. You should be aware of
the following few issues when creating daemon processes. During
development, it is always advisable to run the server in the
foreground in order to use <span   class="bold"><b>printf</b></span>
or <span   class="bold"><b>write</b></span> for debugging. Also, if
the server happens to go berserk, it can be killed by sending the
interrupt character (typically <b  >ctrl-c</b>). While
being deployed for use, the server should be coded to act like a
daemon. Daemon programs in Unix typically end in the letter
<span   class="emphasis"><em>d</em></span>, e.g.,
<span   class="bold"><b>httpd</b></span> for the HTTP daemon (web
server).
</p><p>It is always nice to have a daemon automatically put itself
in the background when run. This is quite easy to achieve using the
<span   class="bold"><b>fork()</b></span> call. A well-behaved daemon
will close all the open file descriptors it inherited from its
parent after the fork. This is especially important if the files
are terminal devices, as they must be closed to allow the terminal
state to reset when the user who starts the daemon logs out. Use
the <span   class="bold"><b>getrlimit()</b></span> call to determine
the maximum number of open file descriptors and to close
them.</p><p>The process must then change its process group. Process
groups are used in distributing signals&mdash;those processes with the
same group as the terminal are in the foreground and are allowed to
read from the terminal. Those in a different group are considered
in the background (and will be blocked if they attempt to
read).</p><p>Closing the controlling terminal and changing the session
group prevents the daemon process from receiving implicit (i.e.,
not sent by the user with the <span   class="bold"><b>kill</b></span>
command) signals from the previous group leader (commonly a
shell).</p><p>Processes are organized within process groups and process
groups within sessions. With the
<span   class="bold"><b>setsid()</b></span> system call, a new
session (and thus, a new process group) is then created with the
process as the new session leader.</p><p>Once the daemon is without a controlling terminal, it must
not re-acquire one. Controlling terminals are automatically
acquired when a process group leader opens a terminal device. The
easiest way to prevent this is to fork again after calling
setsid(). The daemon runs in this second child. Since the parent
(the session and process group leader) will terminate, the second
child will obtain a new process group of zero (since it becomes a
child of <span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span>). Therefore, it
cannot acquire a new controlling terminal, since it is not a
process leader. Many standard library routines may assume the three
standard I/O descriptors are open. As a result, servers commonly
open all three descriptors, connected to a harmless I/O device such
as /dev/null.</p><p>Daemons are typically started at boot-up and remain running
throughout the uptime life of the system. If a daemon was started
from a mounted file system, it would be impossible to unmount the
file system until the daemon was killed. As a result, it is a
sensible daemon programming practice to perform a
<span   class="bold"><b>chdir()</b></span> to <b  >/</b>
(or perhaps to a file system which holds files relevant to the
operation of the daemon). Daemons inherit
<span   class="bold"><b>umask</b></span> information from the process
which created them. To prevent problems with file creation later
within the daemon, it is commonly set to zero using
<span   class="bold"><b>umask()</b></span>.
<a href="2335l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> illustrates these points
with some sample code.</p><p>For systems that do not support sessions (e.g., some systems
other than Linux and Solaris), you can achieve the same result as
setsid() using the code from <a href="2335l2.html" target="_self">Listing
2</a>.</p><p>When the forked children of the main server code exit, their
memory is deallocated but their entries in the process table are
not removed. In other words, the processes are dead, i.e., they do
not consume system resources, but they have not been reaped yet.
The reason they stay around in this
<span   class="emphasis"><em>zombie</em></span>-like form is to allow the parent to
gather statistics from the child if necessary (such as CPU usage,
etc). Obviously, a daemon does not want to fill the process table
with zombie processes.</p><p>When a child dies, it sends its parent a
<b  >SIGCHLD</b> signal. The default handler of this
signal causes the child to turn into a zombie, unless it is
explicitly reaped by its parent, as in
<a href="2335l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>. Alternatively, as shown
in <a href="2335l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a>, you can ignore the
signal and allow the zombie to die.</p><p>It is also quite common for daemons to ignore most other
signals or to re-read any configuration files and restart after
being sent <b  >SIGHUP</b>. Many daemons save their PID
(process identification) to a log file, typically called
/var/run/foobar.pid (where <span   class="bold"><b>foobar</b></span>
is the name of the daemon), which can aid in stopping the
daemon.</p><p>When the system is being shut down (or changing from
multi-user to single-user), the <b  >SIGTERM</b> signal
is sent to notify all processes. The
<span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> process then waits a specific
amount of time (20 seconds for SVR4, 5 seconds for BSD, 5 seconds
for Linux init, 3 seconds or a passed command-line argument Linux
<span   class="bold"><b>shutdown</b></span>). If the process is still
alive, a <b  >SIGKILL</b> signal which cannot be ignored
is sent to it. Therefore, daemon processes should catch the
<b  >SIGTERM</b> signal to ensure they shut down
gracefully.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb3b580.0xc34688"></a>Network Daemon Designs</h2></div></div><p><a href="2335f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. Three
Designs for a Network Service Daemon</b></span></a></p><p>In Figure 1, the diagrams show three potential designs for a
daemon providing a network service to prospective clients. In the
first picture, the daemon follows the most common technique of
forking off a separate process to handle the request, while the
parent continues to accept new connection requests. This concurrent
processing technique has the advantage that requests are constantly
being serviced and may perform better than serializing and
iteratively servicing requests. Unfortunately, forks and potential
context-switches are involved, making this approach unsuited to
servers with very high demand.</p><p>The second diagram shows the iterative, synchronous,
accepting and handling of a request within a single context of
execution, before another request is handled. This approach has the
drawback that requests which occur during the handling of the
request will either get blocked or rejected. If blocked, they will
be blocked for at most the duration of the request processing and
communication. Depending on this duration, a significant number of
requests could potentially get rejected due to the listen queue
backlog having filled. Therefore, this approach is perhaps best
suited to handling requests of a very short duration. It is also
better suited to UDP network daemons rather than TCP
daemons.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb3b580.0xc348f0"></a>Process Pre-allocation</h2></div></div><p>The third diagram (Figure 1) is the most complicated&mdash;it
shows a daemon which pre-allocates new contexts of execution (in
this case, new processes) to handle the requests. Note that the
master calls fork() after
<span   class="bold"><b>listen()</b></span>, but before an
<span   class="bold"><b>accept()</b></span> call. The slave processes
call accept(). This scenario will leave a pool of potential server
processes blocking an accept() call at the same time. However, the
kernel guarantees that only one of the slaves will succeed in its
accept() call for a given connection request. It will then service
the request before returning to the accept state. The master
process can either exit (with <b  >SIGCHLD</b> being
ignored) or continually call
<span   class="bold"><b>wait()</b></span> to reap exiting slave
processes.</p><p>It is quite common for the slave processes to accept only a
certain number of requests before committing suicide to prevent
memory-leaks from accumulating. The process with the lowest number
of accepted requests (or perhaps a special manager parent) would
then create new processes as necessary. Many popular web servers
implement pools of pre-forked server threads (e.g., Netscape,
Apache).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb3b580.0xc34bb0"></a>Delayed Process Allocation</h2></div></div><p>If the server process time of a request is very short (the
usual case), concurrent processing is not always necessary. An
iterative server may perform better by avoiding the overhead of
context-switching. One hybrid solution between concurrent and
iterative designs is to delay the allocation of new server
processes. The server will begin processing requests iteratively.
It will create a separate slave process to finish handling a
request if the processing time for that request is substantial.
Thus, a master process can check the validity of requests, or
handle short requests, before creating a new slave.</p><p>To use delayed process allocation, use the
<span   class="bold"><b>alarm()</b></span> system call, as shown in
<a href="2335l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a>. A timer is established
in the master, and when the timer expires, a signal handler is
called. A fork() system call is performed inside the handler. The
parent closes the request connection and returns to an accepting
state, whereas the child handles the request. The
<span   class="bold"><b>setjmp()</b></span> system call records the
state of the process's stack environment. When the
<span   class="bold"><b>longjmp()</b></span> is later invoked, the
process will be restored to exactly the same state as saved by the
setjmp(). The second parameter to longjmp() is the value that
setjmp() will return when the stack is restored.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb3b580.0xc2b700"></a>Threading</h2></div></div><p>All of the forking in these examples could be replaced with
calls to <span   class="bold"><b>pthread_create()</b></span> to
create a new thread of execution rather than a full heavyweight
process. As mentioned previously, the threads should be
kernel-level threads to ensure that a block on I/O in one thread
does not starve others of CPU attention. This involves using Xavier
Leroy's excellent kernel-level Linux Threads package
(http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/linuxthreads/), which is based on
the <span   class="bold"><b>clone()</b></span> system call.</p><p>Implementing with threads introduces more complications than
using the fork() model. Granted, the use of threads gives great
savings in context-switching time and memory usage. Other issues
come into play, such as availability of file descriptors and
protection of critical sections.</p><p>Most operating systems limit the number of open file
descriptors a process is allowed to hold. Although the process can
use getrlimit() and setrlimit() calls to increase this up to a
system-wide maximum, this value is usually set to 256 by
<b  >NOFILE</b> in the /usr/include/sys/param.h
file.</p><p>Even tweaking <b  >NOFILE</b> and the values
<b  >NR_OPEN</b> and <b  >NR_FILE</b> in the
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/fs.h file and recompiling the kernel
may not help here. While in Linux the <b  >fileno</b>
element of the <b  >FILE struct</b> (actually called
<b  >_fileno</b> in Linux) is of type
<b  >int</b>, it is commonly <b  >unsigned
char</b> in other systems, limiting file descriptors to 255
for buffered I/O commands
(<span   class="bold"><b>fopen()</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>fprintf()</b></span>, etc). This difference
affects the portability of the finished application.</p><p>Because threads use a common memory space, care must be taken
to ensure this space is always in a consistent state and does not
get corrupted. This may involve serializing writes (and possibly
reads) to shared data accessed by more than one thread (critical
sections). This can be achieved by the use of locks, but care must
be taken to avoid entering a state of deadlock.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb3b580.0xc2bde0"></a>Problems with init</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span>'s primary role is to
create processes from information stored in the /etc/inittab file.
It is either directly or indirectly responsible for all the
user-created processes running on a system. It can respawn
processes it starts if they die.</p><p>The respawning capabilities of init will get quite confused
if the daemon forks as per the code in Listing 1. The original
daemon process will immediately exit (with a child daemon
continuing to run), and init will take this to mean the daemon has
died. A simple solution is to add a command-line switch to the
daemon (perhaps <b  >-init</b>) to inform it to avoid the
forking code. A better solution is to start the daemon from /etc/rc
scripts rather than from the /etc/inittab.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb3b580.0xc2bff0"></a>SVR4 Style /etc/rc</h2></div></div><p>The System V layout of /etc/rc is used in the popular Red Hat
and Debian distributions of Linux. In this system, each daemon that
must be started/stopped has a script in /etc/rc/init.d for Red Hat
and in /etc/init.d for Debian. This script is invoked with a single
command-line argument <b  >start</b> to start the daemon,
and a single command-line argument <b  >stop</b> to stop
the daemon. The script is typically named after the daemon.</p><p>If you want to start the daemon in a particular run level,
you will need a link from the run-level directory to the
appropriate script in /etc/rc/init.d. You must name this start link
S<span   class="emphasis"><em>xxfoobar</em></span>, where <span   class="emphasis"><em>foobar</em></span>
is the name of the daemon and <span   class="emphasis"><em>xx</em></span> is a two
digit number. The number is used to arrange the order in which the
scripts are run.</p><p>Similarly, if you want the daemon to die when changing out of
a particular run level, you will need a corresponding link from the
run-level directory to the /etc/rc/init.d script. The kill link
must be named K<span   class="emphasis"><em>xxfoobar</em></span>, following the same
naming convention as the start link.</p><p>Allowing system administrators to start/stop daemons (by
calling the appropriate script from /etc/rc/init.d, with the
appropriate command- line argument) is one of the nicer advantages
of the SysV structure as well as its greater flexibility over the
previous BSD-style /etc/rc.d layout.</p><p>The shell script in <a href="2335l6.html" target="_self">Listing
6</a> shows a typical Red Hat style example in /etc/rc/init.d
for a daemon called foobar.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb3b580.0xc2c4c0"></a>Using syslog()</h2></div></div><p>It is often useful for a daemon to log its activities for
debugging and system administration/maintenance purposes. It does
this by opening a file and writing events to this file as they
happen. Many Linux daemons use the
<span   class="bold"><b>syslog()</b></span> call to log daemon status
information etc. The syslog is a client-server logging facility,
originating from BSD 4.2. I am not aware of any SVR4 or POSIX
equivalent. Messages to the syslog service are generally sent to
text files described in /etc/syslog.conf, but may be sent to remote
machines running a <span   class="bold"><b>syslogd</b></span>
daemon.</p><p>Using the Linux syslog interface is quite simple. Three
function calls are prototyped in /usr/include/syslog.h (see the
syslog.3 man page):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
void openlog(char *ident, int option, int
        facility);
void syslog(int priority, char *format, ...);
void closelog(void);
</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>openlog()</b></span> creates a
connection to the system logger. The <b  >ident</b>
string is added to each message logged and is generally the name of
the daemon. The <b  >option</b> parameter allows for
logging to the console in case of error, logging to stderr as well
as the console, logging of the PID and so on. The
<b  >facility</b> argument classifies the type of program
or daemon logging the message and this defaults to
<b  >LOG_USER</b>.
</p><p>The syslog() call does the actual logging. Values for
<b  >format</b> and the variable arguments are similar to
printf(), with the exception that <b  >%m</b> will be
replaced by the error message corresponding to the current value of
<b  >errno</b>. The <b  >priority</b> parameter
indicates the type and relative importance of the message being
logged.</p><p>To break the connection with the system logger and close any
associated file descriptor or socket, use
<span   class="bold"><b>closelog()</b></span>. The use of openlog()
and closelog() is optional. More detailed information on these
functions is available in the syslog (3) man page.</p><p><a href="2335s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="2335s2.html" target="_self">BSD daemon()</a></p></div></div>
