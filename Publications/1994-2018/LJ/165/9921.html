Date Tip</h4><p>
In the Tech Tips section of the November 2007 <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>, there is
a tip called &ldquo;Show Date or Time, Past or Future&rdquo; that requires you to
download and compile showdate.c.
</p><p>
Another way to do these date calculations is to use the GNU date
command that is included in most (all?) Linux distributions. See:
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html#Relative-items-in-date-strings" target="_self">www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html#Relative-items-in-date-strings</a>.

Stealing</h4><p>
Mr Copeland's argument for stealing music boiled down to its essence is
&ldquo;because it's possible, it's okay&rdquo; [<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, November 2007,
Letters]. It's a refreshingly candid argument.
</p><p>
While I certainly agree that by buying a song, I should be allowed and able
to play it on any device I own (or will own), it does not follow that I now
have the right to redistribute it to others, simply because I could!
</p><p>
The (possible) greed of the RIAA, et al., is a red herring. If you think an
item is too expensive, don't buy it. If enough people feel the same way,
the price will come down (or the creator will go bankrupt).
</p><p>
If in fact the community (including <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>) does indeed condone Mr
Copeland's (and other's) argument, then I have a perfectly good CD
containing the latest <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> archive (which I
recently bought) that
I will be happy to make available on my Web site for immediate free
worldwide distribution. I'll just conveniently ignore that bothersome
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>
&ldquo;All Rights Reserved&rdquo; copyright notice at the bottom.
</p><p>
The irony is apparent in Mr Copeland's last paragraph where he states
&ldquo;If
you fear people or begrudge them control over their own lives....&rdquo;
</p><p>
Musicians, artists and others who create intellectual
property or content are people too, and by your own arguments, they have
the right to control their own lives, and that means THEY have the right to
decide what happens to their intellectual property, how it should be
distributed, what rights are allowed or reserved, etc. Why shouldn't they
be entitled to leverage new technology to make money for themselves?
Ultimately, that's what we all do.

Disabling Services Revisited</h4><p>
Nicholas Petreley's command-line method to temporarily disable services, as described in
the July 2007 <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Tech Tips section, works.
</p><p>
Granted, renaming the files the way he suggests is a far better
alternative to simply removing them. However, there are very easy-to-use
command-line utilities that properly deal with this problem:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
chkconfig (Red Hat or alike systems).
</p></li><li><p>
update-rc.d (Debian or alike systems&mdash;consider looking into file-rc).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
One more reason not to rename these files is that they will most likely
be missed by the package manager when the package is removed.

Waiting for Feedback
</h4><p>
I read, with not inconsiderable interest, parts of the letter by
Chuck Adams titled &ldquo;Sold on Kubuntu&rdquo;, October 2007
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>,
wherein appeared, &ldquo;Now I can do a case in
less than ten minutes on an AMD64.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Well, now, that simple assertion&mdash;per se&mdash;seemed so
interesting to me, for I did my M. Sc. N-Body work on an
IBM System/360 Model 50 under OS/360 circa 1973, I
just had to check into it a little more deeply! And, you see,
my most expensive single run cost only ~ C$7,000.00, I
seem to recall!
</p><p>
So, assuming his runs took 3.5 hours (that is, 210 minutes) on
a CDC 7600 versus ten minutes on an AMD64, the time
ratio is only 21&mdash;I calculated!
</p><p>
Therefore, while I guess that's possible&mdash;albeit somewhat
seemingly [s]low&mdash;any feedback therefore from Dr Adams
would be most gratefully appreciated, of course!
</p><p>
I now mostly employ Red Hat Linux Fedora 7, x86_64,
on an AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual-Core 5600+ processor-based
PC built from components purchased from Fry's and assembled
at home, <span   class="emphasis"><em>avec quelque succes</em></span>.

The Audacity...</h4><p>
After a lapse, it's good to be receiving <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> again. As a nontraditional (older) college
student, money can be very tight at times. Money
has been very tight over the past couple of years.
Unfortunately, pleasures in life end up getting
pushed aside in the name of the necessities.
</p><p>
I have always liked the Cooking with Linux column
by Marcel Gagn&eacute;. In the October 2007 issue, he wrote
about audio editors. As an Audacity user, I can say
Mr Gagn&eacute; forgot one tiny little detail when
it comes to writing out one's creations, and that is,
Audacity does not come ready to write to the MP3
format. (At least this is true in SUSE.) It will write to
the OGG and wav format right out of the box but
not to the MP3 format. I always have had to, first,
install the MP3 library file in the proper place and
then tell Audacity where to find it before I could
write MP3 files.

Thanks Jack</h4><p>
I just wanted to say that I enjoyed Jack Xue's article on creating a
Linux-based e-mail system that integrates with Active Directory in the
November 2007 issue. One
thing I want to correct or add to his article is that Windows Server
2003 R2 is not required for acquiring the POSIX schema modifications
that are needed for authenticating UNIX clients. POSIX attributes and
object classes are required, and Windows Server 2003 R2 includes those
schema changes automatically; however, R1's Active Directory schema can
still be modified to support POSIX accounts. It's just that the same 
third-party product that provides it to R2 has to be manually installed for
R1: Services For Unix 3.5 (SFU). This includes the POSIX schema changes
as well as other UNIX utilities and services (for example, NFS). This is useful
for people who have Windows Server 2003 R1 who do not want to upgrade to
R2.
</p><p>
I hope Jack has more articles to share with us in the future. Great
article.
