Hack, analyze and learn from an intentionally insecure Web application.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c15580.0x1d0d450"></a></h2></div></div><p>
As more and more critical applications have adopted Web browser
front ends, Web security has become the most critical front in Internet
security. And yet, year after year, the same types of Web application
security mistakes keep cropping up in security bulletins: SQL injection,
cross-site scripting, authentication mechanisms that &ldquo;fail
open&rdquo; and
so forth. How, as a Web developer or administrator, can you avoid making
these mistakes with your own Web applications?
</p><p>
The WebGoat can help. Developed by the Open Web Application Security
Project (OWASP), the WebGoat is an &ldquo;intentionally insecure&rdquo; Tomcat
Web application that walks you through common Web security mistakes,
exploits and solutions. In this article, I explain how to install
WebGoat on your Linux system and use it to educate yourself on Web
application security.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c15580.0x1d0d710"></a>
Getting and Installing WebGoat</h2></div></div><p>
The WebGoat on Linux has a critical dependency: the Java 1.5 Software
Development Kit (JDK 1.5). Therefore, make sure you've installed your
distribution's package for the JDK 1.5. On SUSE and OpenSUSE systems, this
package is called java-1_5_0-sun-devel. On Debian and Debian-derived
distributions, like Ubuntu, it's called sun-java5-jdk. Note that Red
Hat and its derivatives don't have their own JDK 1.5 packages; see
Resources for links to two articles that may help.
</p><p>
Your JDK 1.5 package's setup script should set your JAVA_HOME
environment variable to the JDK's root directory. (On my OpenSUSE
system, this is /usr/lib/jvm/java, which is actually a series of links to
/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun-1.5.0_12/.) You may need to log out and back
in for this variable to &ldquo;take&rdquo;, but regardless, it must be set correctly
for WebGoat to run. If in doubt, do an <tt  >echo
$JAVA_HOME</tt> from a bash
session to check to see whether it's set correctly.
</p><p>
Note that you do <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> need Apache installed to run WebGoat. In fact,
if it is installed, I recommend you shut it down. WebGoat runs on its
own bundled Tomcat installation, so although Tomcat <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> required,
you don't need to install it separately.
</p><p>
To get the latest version of WebGoat,
go to either WebGoat's SourceForge Web site 
(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64424&amp;package_id=61824" target="_self">sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64424&amp;package_id=61824</a>)
or its Google Code Downloads site 
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/webgoat/downloads/list" target="_self">code.google.com/p/webgoat/downloads/list</a>). Along
with the Windows
releases of WebGoat, you'll find the standalone Web Application Archive
file (WAR) version of WebGoat for UNIX/Linux and the
&ldquo;Release&rdquo; version
that includes Tomcat. You should opt for the latter, unless you've already
got a working Tomcat installation on your system.
</p><p>
On my OpenSUSE system, I unzipped the Release version
(Unix_WebGoat-5.0_Release.zip) in my home directory, which resulted
in a new subdirectory, WebGoat-5.0 (/home/mick/WebGoat-5.0/). This
directory contains a readme file (readme.txt), WebGoat's startup script
(webgoat.sh) and another directory, tomcat, that contains the Tomcat
servlet engine plus, of course, the WebGoat WAR file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c15580.0x1d0dbe0"></a>
Adjunct Tools</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you've installed WebGoat and the things on which it depends, but
before plunging into Web-hacking mayhem, there's one other
thing you need: a good graphical local Web proxy. Not a proxy
<span   class="emphasis"><em>server</em></span>
like Squid; rather, a local proxy you can use to intercept, view and
alter the data your Web browser sends to Web servers. This is a critical
tool in the Web hacker's bag of tricks&mdash;it's also very useful for
Web developers who need to troubleshoot their own Web applications&mdash;and you'll need it to complete many lessons in WebGoat.
</p><p>
OWASP recommends the official OWASP proxy, WebScarab, which is available
at <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_WebScarab_Project" target="_self">www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_WebScarab_Project</a>. WebScarab is a
free, full-featured Web proxy and spider (a spider follows all links on
a Web site, effectively cataloging it), all with a convenient GUI. It's
also written in Java, which means it's cross-platform.
</p><p>
WebScarab can be downloaded as either a &ldquo;self-contained&rdquo; JAR
file (Java archive) and run with <tt  >java -jar
./webscarab-selfcontained-20070504-1631.jar</tt> or as an installer
(currently webscarab-installer-20070504-1631.jar) that, when executed
via the command <tt  >java -jar
webscarab-installer-20070504-1631.jar</tt>,
unpacks WebScarab into the WebScarab directory in your home directory
and installs a shortcut in your KDE or GNOME start menu. Start WebScarab
either via this shortcut or by executing the self-contained version
with the <tt  >java -jar</tt> command.
</p><p>
Another good graphical, Java-based local Web proxy is Paros, available
at <a href="http://www.parosproxy.org/index.shtml" target="_self">www.parosproxy.org/index.shtml</a>. Maybe I'm just more familiar
with it, but I prefer Paros' interface. In my opinion, it's a little more
friendly to non-expert users. You be the judge&mdash;both WebScarab and Paros
are free, so there's no reason not to give each of them a spin.
</p><p>
Paros comes in the form of a zip file that decompresses to the directory
paros. Inside, among other things, are a couple different versions
of a startup script. The one you want is called startserver.sh. Start
it with the command <tt  >sh ./startserver.sh</tt>.
</p><p>
Note that you don't need to be root to install or start either proxy. In
fact, there's no good reason for you to be root, because both proxies, by
default, listen on the unprivileged port TCP 8008. You can change the
listening port in WebScarab's Listener tab or in Paros'
Tools&rarr;Options&rarr;Local proxy screen.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c15580.0x1d0e1b8"></a>
Configuring Your Browser</h2></div></div><p>
You're almost ready to start WebGoat, but there's one last thing to do:
configure your Web browser to direct all traffic to your local proxy (for
example, WebScarab or Paros). This is done in precisely the same way as
specifying a proxy server; to a Web browser, a local proxy and a proxy
server are the same thing. The only real difference is that instead of a
proper fully qualified domain name, you need to give the name localhost
or the IP address 127.0.0.1. Be sure to specify the correct port
too&mdash;the one on which your local proxy is listening (8008 unless you changed it).
</p><p>
Figure 1 shows the proxy configuration screen in Firefox. Access
this screen from the Edit menu:
Edit&rarr;Preferences&rarr;Advanced&rarr;Network&rarr;Connection&rarr;Settings. This dialog is very similar in
other browsers. If your browser's proxy configuration dialog has a
proxy-exceptions field, like Firefox's &ldquo;No Proxy for:&rdquo; box
shown in Figure 1,
make sure this field is blank or that it at least does
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> contain the
values 127.0.0.1 or localhost.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9889f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Starting WebGoat</h2></div></div><p>
Now, you've got JDK 1.5, you've got a local Web proxy running, and
you've reconfigured your browser to use the proxy. It's time to milk
the goat!
</p><p>
To start WebGoat, open a bash shell in your terminal window program of
choice (I'm still partial to plain-old xterm), and change your working
directory to the one WebGoat unzipped into&mdash;/home/darthelm/WebGoat-5.0
on my system. You don't need to be logged in as root to start WebGoat,
but you do need to start WebGoat with root privileges&mdash;for example,
via sudo, so you will need root's password. Therefore, to start WebGoat
listening on TCP port 80, issue this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo sh ./webgoat start80
</pre>
</p><p>
If you're running Apache or some other process on TCP port 80 (though
I don't recommend doing so), you can start WebGoat on TCP port 8080,
with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo sh ./webgoat start8080
</pre>
</p><p>
In either case, you'll be prompted for root's password, and WebGoat
will start up, logging startup messages and errors both to your shell
and also to the file WebGoat-5.0/tomcat/logs/catalina.out. Note that
you can run WebGoat safely in the background by appending an ampersand
(&amp;) to your startup command, but there's little point. Although you'll,
thus, be able to issue other commands from the same shell, all those log
messages still will make that particular shell nearly unusable. It's
better simply to open another terminal window.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c15580.0x1d0e840"></a>
Using WebGoat</h2></div></div><p>
And, now, you can log in to WebGoat. Simply point the browser
you just reconfigured to http://127.0.0.1/WebGoat/attack (or
http://127.0.0.1:8080/WebGoat/attack if you started WebGoat on TCP
8080). You'll be prompted for a user name and password. Enter
&ldquo;guest&rdquo;
for both values. If you receive the page shown in Figure 2, you're ready to go!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9889f2.large.jpg"><img src="9889f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. WebGoat Welcome Screen
</p></div></div><p>
If you don't see the screen shown in Figure 2, double-check your browser's proxy setting,
make sure your local Web proxy is running, and check the terminal in which you
started WebGoat for error messages. Also, make sure you used
sudo to start WebGoat&mdash;you might think that using the
<tt  >start8080</tt>
command would make this unnecessary, as TCP 8080 is an unprivileged
port, but I've never had any luck running WebGoat as an unprivileged
process.
</p><p>
Once you get the welcome screen, click the Start WebGoat button
to begin.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c15580.0x1d0ec60"></a>
WebGoat Structure and Tips</h2></div></div><p>
The first lesson in WebGoat is an introduction to the WebGoat
interface. It walks you through a simple HTTP transaction and gives you
the opportunity to use WebGoat's various buttons: Hints, Show Params,
Show Cookies, Show Java and Lesson Plans. The Hints and Lesson Plans
buttons are particularly important (your local Web proxy is more useful
for viewing HTTP parameters and cookies), but I find that Lesson Plan
pop-ups don't render properly under KDE's Konqueror browser (they render
fine in Firefox).
</p><p>
After the first lesson, the lessons in WebGoat tend to assume that prior
to running WebGoat, you've done <span   class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span> studying of Web application
security, by at least reading the report &ldquo;OWASP Top 10 2007&rdquo; (available
from <a href="http://www.owasp.org" target="_self">www.owasp.org</a>, in the &ldquo;Top 10
Project&rdquo; section). Therefore,
I highly recommend you download the full PDF version of this report,
read it carefully, and keep it available while you're running WebGoat.
</p><p>
Some of WebGoat's lessons are self-explanatory; the lesson text itself
or the lesson plan tells you everything you need to know in order to
complete the exercise successfully. Other lessons, however, are not
as straightforward. The Hints button can help, but even then you may
find yourself copying and pasting an attack string suggested in a hint,
without really understanding how the attack works.
</p><p>
So my other piece of advice, besides reading &ldquo;OWASP Top 10
2007&rdquo;, is to
feel free to jump around between lessons. They are <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> presented
in order of difficulty, nor do later lessons build on earlier ones,
as far as I can tell. If a given lesson is too hard for you, 
feel free to try a different one instead. You always can try the harder
lesson again later.
</p><p>
This doesn't mean WebGoat is poorly organized; it just means that the
lessons are nonsequential, being instead grouped by type (Code Quality,
Invalidated Parameters, Buffer Overflows and so forth). In summary,
you will have a much more positive WebGoat experience if you first read
the &ldquo;OWASP Top 10 2007&rdquo;, attempt whichever lessons strike your fancy,
paying attention to each lesson's Lesson Plan button, and click the Hints
button as necessary. And, if all else fails, there's always Google!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c15580.0x21073d8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Local Web Proxies: Good or Evil?</b></p><p>
You need to use a local Web proxy in order to carry out many of
the practice attacks in WebGoat. But the only thing that makes them
&ldquo;practice&rdquo; attacks is the fact that you're running them against an
educational Web application running on your own system. The very same
tools and techniques can be used for good <span   class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> evil.
</p><p>
As with any penetration-testing tool, it's up to you to use your local
Web proxy responsibly and ethically. If you run WebScarab or Paros when
interacting with somebody else's Web server, you may be breaking the law
(for example, by probing the site or sending intentionally malformed
requests), even if all you're trying to do is learn.
</p><p>
Unless you're being paid to conduct a legal, fully authorized penetration
test, you should run these tools only on and against <span   class="emphasis"><em>your own
systems</em></span>.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c15580.0x21077a0"></a>
Using WebGoat: a Sample Lesson</h2></div></div><p>
Because WebGoat is itself a tutorial, it would be redundant for me
(and beyond the scope of a single article) to walk through every
lesson. Similarly, Web proxies are too versatile and complex to explain
fully here. (In the future, I may very well devote an entire article
to them.) But, I <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> walk you through a sample WebGoat lesson,
including correct proxy use, as an illustration.
</p><p>
One of my favorite WebGoat lessons is the one on fail-open authentication
mechanisms. If it's possible to make a user-authentication transaction
fail in a way that results in <span   class="emphasis"><em>successful</em></span> authentication, that
authentication mechanism is said to &ldquo;fail open&rdquo;. Needless to say, this
is not the way a secure access mechanism behaves! But, it's a common
Web coding mistake.
</p><p>
WebGoat covers this under the &ldquo;Improper Error Handling&rdquo; section, in the
&ldquo;How to Bypass a Fail Open Authentication Scheme&rdquo; lesson. To start this
lesson, click the &ldquo;Improper Error Handling&rdquo; link on the left-hand
frame of the WebGoat interface, and then click the &ldquo;How to Bypass a Fail
Open Authentication Scheme&rdquo; link that appears below it.
</p><p>
In this lesson, you'll enter a user name and password, use your local Web
proxy to intercept the resulting HTTP request before it reaches the server
(WebGoat), edit the request and then send it on its way.
</p><p>
Therefore, you need to put your Web proxy into intercept mode (trap
mode on Paros). Figure 3 shows WebScarab set up for interception&mdash;all
you need to do is check the box next to &ldquo;Intercept requests&rdquo;. Paros
is similar: click the Trap tab, and check the box next to &ldquo;Trap
request&rdquo;.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9889f3.large.jpg"><img src="9889f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Putting WebScarab into Intercept Mode
</p></div></div><p>
Now, whenever you navigate to a new Web page or submit a Web form,
the resulting HTTP request will be intercepted and stopped by your
local proxy, allowing you to alter the request before forwarding it
on. (WebScarab will pop up an edit window in the same virtual desktop
as your browser session; Paros won't, so you'll need to click on your
Paros window manually.)
</p><p>
Continuing the sample lesson, you now can go back to your browser, and
type in the user name <tt  >webgoat</tt> and some arbitrary string for a password
(Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9889f4.large.jpg"><img src="9889f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Entering User Name and Password
</p></div></div><p>
Be sure your local Web proxy is in intercept/trap mode before clicking
the Login button. After you do, WebScarab will pop up an Edit Request
window like the one shown in Figure 5.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9889f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Editing an Intercepted HTTP Request
</p></div></div><p>
And now, we work our magic. In this Edit Request window, click the
Text tab, select the string Password=blobbo&amp;, and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>delete</em></span>
it. That's right, we're erasing the entire Password parameter from our
authentication submission. This should result in a failed authentication,
right?
</p><p>
But, when you click the Edit Request window's Accept button and
switch back to your browser, you'll see the screen shown in Figure 6.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9889f6.large.jpg"><img src="9889f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. The Attack Succeeded!
</p></div></div><p>
The attack succeeded: you just logged in without knowing, or even
attempting to submit, a password! Before clicking on other links, you
may want to turn off your Web proxy's intercept/trap mode; otherwise,
you'll need to click the proxy's Accept button (Continue
in Paros) repeatedly simply to navigate to and load the page.
</p><p>
The last thing you should do before leaving this lesson is, arguably,
the most important: click WebGoat's Show Java button, and see exactly what
coding errors led to this fail-open condition. You'll find WebGoat's
code to be well-commented and easy to analyze, even if you're a novice
programmer. Remember, the whole point of using WebGoat is not only to
see what can go wrong, but also to learn how to prevent it from going wrong
in the first place.
