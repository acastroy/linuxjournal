Concerned about your privacy? It takes only a Knoppix disc and
a few simple steps to browse the Web anonymously.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a72580.0x2b6a348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Is privacy dead? When I think about how much information my computer
and my gadgets output about me on a daily basis, it might as well
be. My cellphone broadcasts my general whereabouts, and my Web browser
is worse&mdash;every site I visit knows I was there, what I looked at, what
browser and OS I use, and if I have an account on the site, it could
know much more.
</p><p>
Even if you aren't paranoid (yet), you might want
to browse the Web anonymously for many reasons. For one, your information, almost all of
it, has value, and you might like to have some control over who has that
information and who doesn't. Maybe you just want to post a comment to
a blog without the owner knowing who you are. You even could have more
serious reasons, such as whistle-blowing, political speech or research
about sensitive issues such as rape, abuse or personal illness.
</p><p>
Whatever reason you have for anonymity, a piece of software called Tor
provides a secure, easy-to-setup and easy-to-use Web anonymizer. If you
are curious about how exactly Tor works, you can visit the official site
at <a href="http://tor.eff.org" target="_self">tor.eff.org</a>, but in a nutshell, Tor installs and runs on your local
machine. Once combined with a Web proxy, all of your traffic passes
through an encrypted tunnel between three different Tor servers before
it reaches the remote server. All that the remote site will know about
you is that you came from a Tor node.
</p><p>
Tor works well on its own for anonymity, but anyone who has access to
your machine can see that you have it installed. In some situations, even
possession of anonymizing software might implicate you if you work in a
company or live in a country where it is frowned upon. However, even in these
cases, if you have a Knoppix disc, you quickly and easily can set up an
anonymous Web browsing environment that will disappear once you reboot
your computer. Because Knoppix boots and runs completely from the disc,
any changes you make to it are stored in RAM and are erased once you
reboot the machine.
</p><p>
First, you need a Knoppix disc. If you have a fast Internet connection,
download a CD or DVD image from the official Knoppix site and then burn
it to disc. Otherwise, look on the official Knoppix page for links to
retailers who will ship you a Knoppix disc for a fee.
</p><p>
Next, boot your Knoppix disc. Knoppix should attempt to
get on the network automatically, but if it doesn't, click
K&rarr;Knoppix&rarr;Network/Internet
for network configuration options. Knoppix has a sophisticated system
that allows you to write to all areas of the filesystem as though
it were installed on a hard drive. Because of this, you actually
can install Tor on Knoppix according to the official directions on the Tor
site. First, click K&rarr;Knoppix&rarr;Utilities&rarr;Manager software in Knoppix
to start Knoppix's package manager. Then, click Reload to get the latest
list of packages, search for the privoxy and tor packages, and select
them for installation (or, if you want a shortcut, simply open a terminal
and type <tt  >sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install tor
privoxy</tt>).
</p><p>
Now Tor will be set up and running, but Privoxy still needs a bit of extra
configuration to use Tor. Open /etc/privoxy/config in a text editor, and
add this line to the top of the file (don't forget the trailing dot):

<pre     class="programlisting">
forward-socks4a / 127.0.0.1:9050 .
</pre>
</p><p>
After that, find any lines that look like the following and comment them
out with a #:

<pre     class="programlisting">
logfile logfile
jarfile jarfile
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, open a terminal and type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo /etc/init.d/privoxy restart
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a72580.0x2b6a9d0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And, Privoxy will be ready to use.
</p><p>
Although you could configure Iceweasel (Firefox's name on Knoppix) by
hand to use Privoxy, there is a nice plugin created just for Tor. Open
Iceweasel and go to <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2275" target="_self">https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2275</a> to install
the Torbutton plugin. Once you install the plugin and restart Iceweasel,
a button at the bottom right of Iceweasel will appear that says either
&ldquo;Tor Disabled&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tor Enabled&rdquo;. Simply click the
button to toggle the
state, and the plugin will take care of the rest.
</p><p>
From here, you can browse the Web anonymously. If you have never used Tor
before, it's worth noting that you might see a slowdown in performance,
as your traffic does need to be encrypted and pass through three extra
servers. Also, certain sites, such as Google, may appear in their German
or Japanese versions, depending on which Tor node you exit through. Once
you are finished, shut down the machine, and all traces of Tor, Privoxy
and your browsing history will be erased.
