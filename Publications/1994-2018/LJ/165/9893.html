Start on &ldquo;the Path&rdquo; to a more secure system.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc91580.0xd892f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
A tao, meaning &ldquo;the path&rdquo; or &ldquo;the way&rdquo;, is a system of guidelines or
rules meant to achieve a desired end. Like any tao, security requires a
structured, systematic approach. It also should be holistic, encompassing
every part of a system's life span from planning to retirement. The tao
in this article consists of five simple phases that every Linux system
should pass through to establish a secure baseline. The phases are not a
be-all, end-all formula for security. They merely provide a foundation
on which to build deeper levels of security later.
</p><p>
As I go through each phase, I will deploy two sample systems, a Red
Hat Fedora desktop and a Debian server system, to show how security is
implemented. I chose Fedora because it is arguably
the most popular distribution out there. It works well for any purpose,
has many desktop enhancements and is one of the easiest distributions for
non-command-line Linux users to pick up. I chose Debian as our server
platform because it is lightweight, has a long history of reliability,
a great support community and extensive documentation. Both are
excellent platforms and have their own unique security measures built
in. If you have a different distribution preference, 
the phases presented here can be applied to any system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc91580.0xd895b0"></a>
Phase 1: Planning</h2></div></div><p>
The first phase of the tao is also the most important, as it is where
you
make most of the decisions that affect your overall security. The first
step before all others is to define the purpose of the system being
deployed. Will it be a mail server? A desktop? An intrusion-detection
system? Once you have a purpose, you can use it as your guide throughout this
process. The focus then becomes fulfilling that purpose while providing
the most secure environment possible. After all, why deploy a system
that no one can use? Security never should handicap functionality.
</p><p>
Next, you need to decide what your security goals are for the system.
The
primary goal of every build always should be the principle of least
access or least privilege. This means providing only the minimum
permissions to users and programs necessary for the system to operate. You
may have other security goals, such as scanning every file with antivirus
software or authenticating every user with LDAP, but least privilege
always should
be paramount.
</p><p>
Armed with these goals, you need to figure out how to accomplish them before
actually building the system. Answering some simple questions will help 
determine the appropriate steps to meet the goals in phases 2 and 4. Will
this system be server or a desktop? The answer to this question will dictate a
great deal of the configuration on your new system. Will users access
the system locally or remotely? This is another important configuration
question with security implications. Will the system need a desktop
environment? 
</p><p>
If you or the people who will be administering the system are
comfortable with the command line, deploy your system as
&ldquo;headless&rdquo;,
or without a GUI interface. By eliminating the X Window System from
your install, you shrink your attack surface (your exposed area)
dramatically. On the other hand, if you or your staff needs a GUI,
install only one and understand that additional steps are required to
lock down your system properly. It is a good rule of thumb to install
a server without X and use a desktop environment for user desktop systems.
</p><p>
Finally, plan the applications that will operate on this system. Determine
which dependencies and libraries are essential to operation. Too often,
unnecessary libraries are used after a system has been compromised to
run remote commands, mask an intruder's presence or probe networks.
If
you do not need a package do not install it.
</p><p>
When finished working out the answers to these questions, write them
down in a build log or notebook and keep them up to date even after the
initial build.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc91580.0xd89978"></a>
Phase 2: Building</h2></div></div><p>
Armed with written plans, now comes the building phase. Here
is where you begin the technical application of the security goals you set
in the planning phase. Due to space constraints, the following section
is not a detailed checklist of each of the example installs. I have highlighted
only those options that are relevant to the focus on security. As 
in phase 1, write down your selections during installation in a build
log in case you ever need to rebuild the system.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Fedora Core 7</b></span>

</p><p>
Start by booting a fresh system from a Fedora 7 ISO available from any of
the distribution's site mirrors. After entering your keyboard and language
settings, you come to the disk partitioning utility. For most desktops,
the installer does a fine job of configuring the drives appropriately.
But, if the system will be used by someone whose work is sensitive, place
the /home folder on its own partition. 
</p><p>
After partitioning comes the
bootloader options. Select GRUB and set a password. Using a password
with your bootloader is good practice and helps prevent data loss if
your drive or system ever is stolen. Like any good password, it should
have complexity, avoid dictionary words and use numbers, letters and
non-alphanumeric characters. 
</p><p>
On the next screen, select DHCP, as client
machines usually don't require static IPs. If you require one, make sure
to use Network Address Translation (NAT) somewhere on your network. Next,
set a hostname and domain, and set a complex root password. At the package
selection screen, always review what you are installing by using the
Customize Now radio button. On the Custom Selection screen, select only
one desktop environment. Installing more than one environment leads to
more vulnerabilities (and patches to update) later. Leave the default
option on GNOME. Go through each of the other checked options, and you
will discover a lot of packages will be installed (Figure 1). On my build,
I have 843 packages using these options. Your number may vary. Use the
Optional Packages button to eliminate any extraneous packages you do
not need. When you're finished with package selection, the system will reboot.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9893f1.large.jpg"><img src="9893f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
Upon reboot, you are prompted to enable the firewall. Enable it, and add
only the ports/programs you need to operate this system (Figure 2). At
the Security Enhanced Linux screen, if you are able to, set the policy
to enforcing (Figure 3). To those unfamiliar with SELinux, it's a policy-based
protection scheme, originally developed by the National Security Agency,
that adds a layer of security on top of the OS and several popular
Linux applications, such as Apache. The downside to using SELinux is it
sometimes can break the programs you are trying
to protect (and other programs too). If you run into problems, you always
can change the policy
later, using the setenforce command or by editing the policy with a text
editor. You then will be prompted to create a user account, and after a
few other selections, the first login screen comes up.

Figure 3. SELinux dramatically enhances security on your machine.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Debian</b></span>

</p><p>
Start your blank server up with a Debian ISO (4.0r1 used here). Because
I'm using this system as a server for this example, let's take a more
Spartan approach toward the install. Servers usually are a juicier
target than desktops for nefarious people, so you need to take extra
precaution, especially if they will be deployed on a public network or the
Internet. 
</p><p>
After setting the usual options for time zone, country and so
forth, you
need to set a hostname and domain for your server. Next comes
the partitioning options. Rather than putting many of the system
directories on their own partitions, stick with putting the /home
directory on a separate partition, and go one step further by encrypting
your drive. This may sound difficult, but the Debian partitioning utility
makes this easy. Select Guided partitioning from the options, and
then select Guided - Use entire disk and set up encrypted LVM. Use the
entire disk and select the option to use a separate home partition. Debian
recommends further segregating your directories to keep the root, programs
and user data separate, but configurations like this can be difficult
to administer. Write the changes to disk and, when prompted (Figure 4),
enter a complex passphrase to encrypt the volume. Next, set your time zone
and root password, and then the base install will begin. 
</p><p>
After the base
install, the next few prompts are inconsequential until you get to the
software selection screen. For our scenario, install an Apache
Web server only. Finally, install the GRUB loader, and your new system is
ready to go. Upon reboot, lock down the GRUB loader with a password, by
adding the following lines to the /boot/grub/menu.lst file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
timeout 30
password yourpasswordhere
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9893f4.large.jpg"><img src="9893f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc91580.0xd8a630"></a>
Phase 3: Patching</h2></div></div><p>
The next phase in this deployment is to patch the systems. Although
sometimes tedious, patching is a necessary evil. After all, 843 packages
are a lot to protect. You also need to keep your systems updated to mediate
the threat of new vulnerabilities. Thankfully, the example distros
covered in this article
make the process very easy. On the Fedora client, you already have this
ability. Upon the first login, the system checks for updates automatically
(Figure 5). Fedora uses the Yellow Dog Update Manager, better known as yum,
and a new update GUI, pup, to automate the update process. However,
the pop-up style reminder seems to work only in the GNOME desktop
environment. If you want to update your system manually, you also
can use the commands <tt  >yum list updates</tt> or
<tt  >yum info updates</tt> to see which 
packages need an update. You also simply can run
<tt  >yum</tt> without any
options to apply all available updates to all installed packages.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9893f5.large.jpg"><img src="9893f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Fedora checks for updates immediately after install.
</p></div></div><p>
Moving on to the example server, Debian uses a utility called aptitude
(apt) for
updating packages. apt traditionally is used as a package manager, like
Red Hat's RPM, but it also has the ability to check for updates like
yum. It uses predefined and custom source lists to check for updates
against your installed packages. If you do not have the following line
in your /etc/apt/sources.list file, add it so you can check for updates
against the main stable US archive:


<pre     class="programlisting">
deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian stable main contrib non-free
</pre>
</p><p>
Run the <tt  >apt-get update</tt> command after adding the line. To update all 
the packages on your system, type <tt  >apt-get upgrade</tt> (Figure 6) 
from a command prompt, and the system will begin checking and, with your 
approval, downloading and applying the updates. If you want to see what 
packages you have before running apt-get, use the command <tt  >dpkg 
-l</tt>. To 
check for updates once a week, use the commands below or write your own 
script and use crontab to schedule it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo /usr/bin/apt-get  update &gt; /etc/check4updates
echo /usr/bin/apt-get  upgrade &gt;&gt; /etc/check4updates
chmod 750 /etc/check4updates
crontab -e
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9893f6.large.jpg"><img src="9893f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Use apt-get to look for Debian security updates.
</p></div></div><p>
Add the following lines to your crontab file to make the script run
every Wednesday at 3:30am:

<pre     class="programlisting">
30 3 * * 3  /etc/check4updates
</pre>
</p><p>
Beware&mdash;if you compile your own packages or use packages from another
source, they may not be updated automatically using yum or apt-get.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc91580.0x1183220"></a>
Phase 4: Hardening</h2></div></div><p>
After patching your new system, you may need to take additional steps to
secure it. This is where having your security goals noted
in the planning phase helps. You can use these goals to determine what
additional steps are appropriate, as you more than likely will have more
steps than the few illustrated here. The more goals you have, the more
steps you are likely to have as well. Try to keep simplicity in
mind. Complex settings actually can make a system less secure, because
they often can lead to misconfiguration. Also, remember to note these
steps in your build log.
</p><p>
The Fedora example already has shown two important steps to 
enhance security: enabling SELinux and installing a firewall. In
most typical desktop-use scenarios, when combined with an antivirus
application, this is enough. For the Debian box, I have selected three
common steps that should be used on any server system: using sudo, locking
down SSH and using a restrictive iptables firewall. These simple items
should be considered the bare minimum on any server system, and if
desired,
they can be applied to a desktop as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc91580.0x1183380"></a>
sudo</h2></div></div><p>
sudo is a great application for limiting root access, which 
should be guarded closely on any server. Adding users to the /etc/sudoers
file, limits their ability to use su to specific commands, specific
directories or by network host. Any users in the sudoers file simply
need
to type <tt  >sudo</tt> before the commands they want to execute to run under
root credentials. This is much easier and much safer than giving the
root password to everyone.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc91580.0x11834e0"></a>
SSH</h2></div></div><p>
SSH is the standard remote access protocol in use on Linux systems
today. In its default configuration, it has some settings that
you definitely need to lock down. Add the following lines to 
/etc/ssh/sshd.config:

<pre     class="programlisting">
PermitRootLogin no
X11DisplayForwarding no
</pre>
</p><p>
The first line prevents root from logging in to the server via SSH, which
never should be done. The second line disables X forwarding, which would
allow users to launch an X session from your server. In the example case, 
X isn't installed, so this should not be a problem. You could lock down
SSH further by chrooting it or using TCP Wrappers; however, due to space constraints, I have
omitted those configuration steps.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc91580.0x1183698"></a>
iptables Firewall</h2></div></div><p>
Rather than go into a long discussion on the proper configuration of a
a firewall, I have created the following script with comments to secure
the
Debian system. It restricts traffic (statefully) only to new SSH, HTTP and
SSL connections. Change the IP address in this example to your server's address. For more
details on the options available in iptables, consult the man page. When
building your own firewalls, keep in mind the goal of shrinking the attack
surface by opening only necessary ports in iptables:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh

PATH=/usr/sbin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin

#FLUSH PREVIOUS TABLE ENTRIES
iptables --flush

#CHANGE DEFAULT POLICIES FROM
#ACCEPT TO DROP
iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -P FORWARD DROP
iptables -P OUTPUT DROP

#ALLOW LOCAL LOOPBACK TRAFFIC
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT

#ALLOW ESTABLISHED CONNECTIONS
iptables -A INPUT -m state --state \
ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -m state --state \
ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

#ALLOW DEFINED TRAFFIC
#
#SSH - 22
iptables -A INPUT -d 192.168.1.2 -p tcp \
--dport 22 --sport 1024:65535 -m state \
--state NEW -j ACCEPT

#HTTP - APACHE -80
iptables -A INPUT -d 192.168.1.2 -p tcp \
--dport 80 --sport 1024:65535 -m state \
--state NEW -j ACCEPT

#SSL - 443
iptables -A INPUT -d 192.168.1.2 -p tcp \
--dport 443 --sport 1024:65535 -m state \
--state NEW -j ACCEPT
</pre>
</p><p>
Save this script locally, and copy or move it to the /etc/network/if-up.d
directory so that it runs when the network comes up after boot. If you want
to apply this configuration on a Red Hat-based system, you simply
could run the above script and use the <tt  >iptables-save</tt> command to keep the
rule set across reboots.
</p><p>
Although you could take these steps and many more, there is a tool that
makes this process much easier, Bastille (Figures 7 and 8). Bastille uses
question/answer responses to script your preferred security settings
and apply them to the actual system. There also are a multitude of manual
security checklists available for most distributions and applications
that can be found on the Internet. Some of the best checklists are the
benchmarks put out by the Center for Internet Security. These benchmarks
contain detailed settings and descriptions of &ldquo;best
practices&rdquo; relating
to specific operating systems and popular applications. They are
excellent companions to Bastille.

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc91580.0x1183d20"></a>
Phase 5: Monitoring/Auditing</h2></div></div><p>
The last phase of the tao is an ongoing process. Regular monitoring of
your
system will verify that your security goals are being met over time. The
most useful tool for this is built right in to the system, syslog. From
the /var/log/messages file, you can view a variety of security-related
information for both the system and some applications. Many applications
use their own log files. Be sure to look through those as well. If you
have multiple systems, you should use a central syslog server to collect
the logs. This easily can be configured in the syslog.conf file.
</p><p>
A newer alternative to syslog is called Splunk (Figure 9). Splunk has
both free (limited to 500MB daily) and enterprise versions. The nice
thing about Splunk is its super-easy install, and you can search through
logs using Google-like commands through a streamlined Web-based interface.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9893f9.large.jpg"><img src="9893f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. Splunk is one of the best and most useful open-source projects
available.
</p></div></div><p>
As useful as logs are, they do not provide a complete picture of how well
your security is working. Only regular auditing can accomplish this. Doing
so tells you if your security is still in place and functioning. I am
not suggesting penetration testing for every system, but active testing
of your settings is good insurance. Create checklists or scripts to test
those settings that are important to maintaining your security goals. In
lieu of a checklist, you could run Bastille using the --assess switch to
get a security report of your current configuration. You also can use
the CIS benchmarks (which rely on Bastille) as baseline checklists for
an audit. If you can afford it, have an outside consultant come in and
verify your security with his or her own tests to give you peace of mind,
especially if you work in a heavily regulated industry.

On the Path</h2></div></div><p>
Using the phases of the tao in your builds is the first step. This simple,
ordered strategy will get you to a more secure place with your systems;
however, each system is unique. Make sure your security goals match your
system. Security is not difficult. Use simple and repeatable processes,
stay informed of best practices and common vulnerabilities, exercise
least privilege wherever possible, regularly review your logs, and
you will find yourself on the Path.
