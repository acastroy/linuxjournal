Keep your passwords safe in an encrypted file.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x136a580.0x1462298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Like many Internet addicts, I have way too many user name/password accounts to 
remember: accounts on social-networking sites, rarely used logins at work,
on-line banking and so on. One solution to this problem is to use the same user name
and password everywhere, but that's clearly not safe; if people get a hold
of your account information in one place, they own all your other accounts
too.
</p><p>
I wanted a relatively safe, flexible and easy way to store passwords and
other useful confidential information. I also wanted it to be easily
accessible, which meant that I'd like to get at it over a text-only
SSH connection. And, I wanted it to be something that could move around from
machine to machine without too much trouble.
</p><p>
A few months ago, I saw an article by Duane Odom on <a href="http://linux.ocm" target="_self">linux.ocm</a> about a shell script
that uses GPG to encrypt and decrypt a text file containing the user's list
of passwords (or any kind of text). I liked this approach, as it met the
following requirements:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
It stores passwords in a well-encrypted text file (protected by a
master password). The text file could contain anything and be
formatted any way I want.
</p></li><li><p>
The entire interface is text (an ncurses password interface, followed
by <tt  >less</tt> or a text editor like vim), so you can
access it over a nongraphical SSH session (see the 
Accessing Your Password Wallet from the Computer at Your Friend's
House sidebar).
</p></li><li><p>
The script is built on standard utilities common to most Linux
distributions (<tt  >gpg</tt> and
<tt  >dialog</tt>).
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x136a580.0x14628c8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Accessing Your Password Wallet from the Computer at Your Friend's
House</b></p><p>
One of things that has made wallet useful to me is the
ability to reach it from anywhere. Here are a few hints for enabling
SSH access to your broadband-connected Linux box at home.
</p><p>
Rather than try to memorize your computer's IP address (which may change
unexpectedly anyway), you could sign up for a free dynamic DNS service
like DynDNS. This lets you choose a memorable hostname for your
computer, something like carlslinuxbox.dyndns.org. Some of
these services want you to update your DNS record periodically (I think
dyndns.org wants that to happen at least once a month). Rather than do
that by hand, you can run an auto-updater (like inadyn)
in cron. Be careful when setting the update frequency&mdash;some dynamic
DNS services suspend your account if you update too often (read the
fine print).
</p><p>
If you're going to let the Internet talk to SSH on your Linux box,
there are a few things you can do to make that a bit more secure. I
recommend disabling the PermitRootLogin option in
the sshd_config file. You also may want to run SSH on a nonstandard
port using the Port option in sshd_config. If the script
kiddies find SSH running on port 22, they'll throw a bunch of user names
and passwords at it trying to break in. Running SSH on a port other than
22 discourages this sort of thing to a large degree. And, make sure your
firewall allows access to whatever port you use. Finally, if your computer is
behind a consumer cable/DSL router, you'll have to configure the router
to forward SSH traffic to your Linux box.
</p><p>
With those things done, next time you're at a friend's house, you could jump
on a computer, download an SSH client (such as putty) and
SSH to your Linux box (remembering to tell the SSH client your dynamic
DNS hostname and the port number on which you're running SSH).
</p></div><p>
Although I liked the way the original script worked, I wanted to add
several features. So I made some alterations to the original,
and the result is shown in Listing 1.

It's pretty easy to install; simply save the script somewhere in your $PATH and
make it executable. Then, you just need to tell it where your encrypted
password file should be. There are three ways to do this:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Set the $WALLET_FILENAME environment variable.
</p></li><li><p>
Set $WALLET_FILENAME in ~/.walletrc.
</p></li><li><p>
Specify the filename with the -c command-line option.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The second method (which overrides the first method) is my
preference&mdash;I have
the following line in ~/.walletrc:

<pre     class="programlisting">
WALLET_FILENAME=~/docs/wallet.gpg
</pre>
</p><p>
But, if I needed to use a different wallet file, I could override either of the
first two methods with the command-line option by calling the script like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
wallet -c ~/docs/other_wallet.gpg
</pre>
</p><p>
wallet defaults to its read-only mode, in which it displays the
decrypted version of your wallet file using less. But, if you
include the -e command-line option (edit mode), the script
decrypts your wallet file to a temporary location and opens it in a text
editor (the script defaults to using vi, but you can set the
$VISUAL variable in the environment or in your ~/.walletrc file). When you
close the editor, wallet encrypts the file and saves it to the
original location.
</p><p>
The first time you run wallet, you won't have a wallet file, so
wallet creates it for you and runs in edit mode.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x136a580.0x1463370"></a>
How It Works</h2></div></div><p>
Let's dig in to the script to see how it works. The first thing it does is 
use the dot operator to source a file called functions, which
appears as shown in Listing 2. Having wallet source an external file (with
the dot operator) is essentially equivalent to inserting the contents of the
sourced file (~/bin/functions) at line 3 of wallet. Doing it this
way allows other scripts to use the same code (a code library for shell
scripts).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x136a580.0x1463478"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 2. functions File</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

is_installed() {

    PROGRAM=$1

    PATHNAME=$( type $PROGRAM 2&gt; /dev/null )
    if [ -z "$PATHNAME" ]; then
        echo "cannot locate $PROGRAM in path"
        exit 1
    fi

}

</pre></div><p>
The functions file includes a function called
is_installed, which uses the bash built-in type to
see whether a program is installed. If is_installed doesn't find the
program in your $PATH, is_installed prints an error message and
calls exit, which terminates wallet. So, if you
run wallet and it quits with an error like &ldquo;cannot locate
dialog in path&rdquo;, you probably haven't installed the dialog
package. Use your distribution's package management system (yum, apt-get,
whatever) to install dialog and try again.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x136a580.0x1463738"></a>
Input Validation</h2></div></div><p>
Lines 18 through 28 of the wallet script parse the command-line arguments using the
getopts bash built-in. The while loop loops through
the options specified by the string ec:. This means that
wallet can accept the -e and -c
options, and that the -c option requires an argument. As the
while loop moves through the command-line arguments, the current option is
assigned to the variable $OPTION, and any argument to the current option is
assigned to the variable $OPTARG. Any unrecognized option results in an error
message, and wallet exits. After the while loop completes, it's
important to reset the $OPTIND variable (this is necessary after any
getopts call).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x136a580.0x1463840"></a>
Running wallet the First Time</h2></div></div><p>
Lines 37 through 45 of the wallet script verify that the encrypted file exists, and create the file
if it doesn't exist already. The -f test checks to see whether
$WALLET_FILENAME exists as a normal file. If not, the test fails, and
wallet assumes you are running wallet for the
first time and that wallet needs to set up the working
environment. wallet uses the command substitution syntax
for creating the directory in which the encrypted file should exist (line 40):

<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir -p $( dirname $WALLET_FILENAME )
</pre>
</p><p>
The command inside the $(...) runs first, and the result becomes the argument to
mkdir. The dirname command returns the encrypted
file's directory, and mkdir -p creates that directory (and any
necessary parent directories).
</p><p>
Next, wallet needs to create the encrypted file (even though the
unencrypted version will be empty). Line 41 uses mktemp to create
an empty file in /tmp whose name ends in six randomly chosen characters.
mktemp prints the name of the file it creates, so running this in
a command substitution shell and assigning the result to $TEMPFILE puts the
name of the temporary file in $TEMPFILE.
</p><p>
Now we see the first use of gpg. Line 42 uses gpg to
encrypt the (empty) temporary file ($TEMPFILE) via symmetric encryption
(gpg's -c option) and to write the encrypted file to
$WALLET_FILENAME. wallet then deletes the temporary file. Because
this is the first time wallet has run, it assumes that edit mode
is appropriate and sets the $EDIT_PWFILE flag.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x136a580.0x1463aa8"></a>
Prompting the User for the Master Password</h2></div></div><p>
Line 52 uses the command substitution trick again, this time to prompt the
user for the master password (used to encrypt the wallet file). The
dialog man page describes the many ways that scripts using
dialog can retrieve input from the user. This example uses dialog
to create a simple password box. The --stdout option tells
dialog to print the user's input (the master password) to
standard output, so that it may be assigned to $PASSWORD.
</p><p>
Line 55 inspects the bash variable $?, which contains the exit
code of the previous process (dialog, in this case). The
convention is that an exit code of 0 indicates success (and
wallet follows this convention in its own exit
calls). If $? differs from 0 on line 55, this indicates that
dialog encountered an error, and wallet terminates
with an error message.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x136a580.0x1463c08"></a>
Read-Only Mode</h2></div></div><p>
If $EDIT_PWFILE is 0 (line 65), then wallet is running in
read-only mode:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo $PASSWORD | gpg --decrypt --passphrase-fd 0 
 &#8618;$WALLET_FILENAME | less
</pre>
</p><p>
This tells gpg to decrypt $WALLET_FILENAME and to read the
password from standard input (fd 0). Piping $PASSWORD into gpg
enables gpg to decrypt the wallet file without interactively
asking the user for the master password. The output (the decrypted wallet
file) is printed to standard output, which is piped into less,
allowing the user to page through the passwords, run searches and so on. When the
user closes less, wallet clears the screen and
exits.
</p><p>
The rest of the script assumes that $EDIT_PWFILE is nonzero (that
wallet is running in edit mode).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x136a580.0x19ecb18"></a>
Edit Mode</h2></div></div><p>
In edit mode, wallet needs to decrypt the wallet file, open the
decrypted file in a text editor, and then encrypt the edited file back to the
original location. Line 74 uses mktemp to create a temporary
directory, into which the wallet file will be decrypted. Line 75 sets
$CLEARTEXT_WALLET_FILENAME to be the name of a file inside the temporary
directory.
</p><p>
Line 79 runs trap, a bash built-in. The first argument to
trap is a command, and this is followed by a list of signals
(for example, if someone runs <tt  >kill</tt> on wallet). If
wallet receives any of these signals after line 79,
wallet will run the trapped command (deleting the decrypted
wallet file) prior to exiting. This is an attempt to ensure that the
decrypted file isn't left sitting around if wallet terminates
unexpectedly.
</p><p>
Line 83 is like what we saw in read-only mode, with the addition of the
-o option to gpg. This instructs gpg to
write the decrypted file to $CLEARTEXT_WALLET_FILENAME.
</p><p>
If gpg's exit code was 0, wallet renames the
encrypted wallet file with a .bak extension (thus preserving a copy, in case
something goes wrong) and opens the decrypted file in the text editor $VISUAL.
After the editor exits, wallet tells gpg to encrypt
the edited plain-text file at $CLEARTEXT_WALLET_FILENAME and to write the
encrypted wallet file back to $WALLET_FILENAME. A nonzero exit status from
this gpg call means that something went wrong in re-encrypting
the wallet file, so wallet makes a copy of the plain-text file in
your home directory and prints an error message.

Listing 3 shows a short shell script that generates very random,
impossible-to-remember passwords&mdash;perfect for storing in your wallet.
mkpass dumps a kilobyte of random data into a digest
algorithm to produce an ASCII password. By default, mkpass
uses the SHA1 digest algorithm, but it can use MD5 if you supply
mkpass's -m command-line option. And, if
you give the -r option, mkpass prints a
ruler below the password (useful if you need or want a password of a
particular length).
</p><p>
If you're a vim user, try adding the following line to your ~/.vimrc file:

<pre     class="programlisting">

map \mkpass i &lt;CR&gt;&lt;ESC&gt;k$:r!~/bin/mkpass -n&lt;CR&gt;kJJ

</pre>
</p><p>
Now when you're running vim (like when you're using wallet in

password
at the cursor location.
