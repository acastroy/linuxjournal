they are still the first line of defense in system security.

What is this I see on our specials chalkboard,
Fran&ccedil;ois? Mxyztplk? That is the root password for our
main server! <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon Dieu!</em></span> What do I see here? Those are all our
administrative passwords! Why would you post secret information where
everyone can see it? <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi?</em></span> So you would not forget? But Fran&ccedil;ois,
neither will anyone else. I see you have posted your own login passwords as
well. Please, erase those immediately and wash the chalkboard when you
are done. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Merci.</em></span> Now, just to be safe, we will need to generate a
whole new set of passwords for all our systems. What were you thinking,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>? Of course, I see. We'll discuss this later. 
Our guests are arriving now. Prepare yourself, Fran&ccedil;ois.
</p><p>
Welcome, everyone! How wonderful to see you here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez
Marcel</em></span>, home of superb Linux and open-source software and, of course,
wine served from one of the world's finest wine cellars. Speaking of
wine...Fran&ccedil;ois, please head down to the wine cellar, over in the
East wing, and bring back the 2005 Sonoma County
Kokomo Zinfandel.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite!</em></span>
</p><p>
Ah, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, you missed a rare opportunity to see all of Chez
Marcel's security, exposed on our Specials du Jour board. Nevertheless,
it does provide an excellent backdrop to our menu this evening, as all
the items relate to password security. Passwords, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>, are
still your first line of defense when it comes to computers. Biometric
systems, like fingerprint readers, can make secure access more daunting
and difficult to breach, but most systems, including countless Web sites,
require a user name and password for access, and that's not changing
anytime soon. In the end, it usually comes back to passwords, and
passwords mean people need to remember them. And, that's where the problem
starts.
</p><p>
I've been in offices where people will tell you (if you insist) that
everyone pretty much knows everybody else's passwords&mdash;just in
case. I've seen yellow sticky notes stuck to computer screens with
passwords written down so the users don't forget. Even when that
information is out of sight, people use simple passwords, like the word
&ldquo;password&rdquo;, because they're easy to remember.
</p><p>
One way to get secure passwords that aren't your pet's name or your
spouse's birthday is to pick a phrase that means something to you,
and then play with it. For example, take the phrase &ldquo;Believe in
magic!&rdquo; Now, take only the consonants of the first and last word, and
you have blvmgc. Add an I at the beginning, but make that I a numeric 1
instead. Add an asterisk for the final character, and you have
1blvmgc*&mdash;a great password if ever there was one.
</p><p>
Another, more secure way (particularly if you need many passwords),
is to enlist the help of a random password generator. One such program is
Pierre &ldquo;khorben&rdquo; Prochery's makepasswd program (inspired by Rob Levin's
Perl script of the same name). Pierre's makepasswd program uses
your computer's random number generator to create passwords of varying
constraints. It also can generate encrypted passwords. You can
get a single, random password by typing <tt  >makepasswd</tt> at a shell
prompt. The program also accepts different parameters on the command
line, as shown here:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ makepasswd --chars 8 --count=4
0dAU8BXM
suQt4CF2
5x0yGJ1S
6KTInj58
</pre>
</p><p>
So, what happened? The <tt  >--chars 8</tt> parameter tells the program to
use exactly eight characters in the resulting password. You also can specify
<tt  >--minchars</tt> and <tt  >--maxchars</tt> to get different password
lengths. The <tt  >--count=4</tt> parameter tells the program to generate
four passwords. The default is to provide only one password. Type
<tt  >makepasswd --help</tt> for a full list of parameters.
</p><p>
Shell users know this well, but those who take the time to learn the
ins and outs of their Linux systems learn this too; many graphical
programs are front ends to one or more text- or shell-based commands. The
same is true for the next item on our menu, KriptPass, which wraps
the makepasswd program in a nice, graphical interface. KriptPass
is a Kommander script available from <a href="http://Kriptopolis.org" target="_self">Kriptopolis.org</a>. Kommander is
a combination program editor and executor that can be used to create any
number of graphical applications using the KDE framework. I mention
Kommander, because you need it to use KriptPass. So,
installing Kommander is the first step. Because it's a KDE application,
check your system to see whether you already have Kommander installed. If
you don't, check your distribution's repositories and install it. Because
KriptPass is based on makepasswd, you need that as well.
</p><p>
Assuming you have Kommander installed, installing
and running KriptPass is as simple as downloading it from
<a href="http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php/KriptPass?content=58800" target="_self">www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php/KriptPass?content=58800</a>.
Extract the script wherever you like, open up Konqueror and simply click
on the kriptpass.kmdr file. That's all there's to it (if you
like, you can add a shortcut icon on your desktop for future use). The
KriptPass window appears (Figure 1), and you'll see three tabs
labeled Passwords, Wireless Keys and About.

More information on Kommander is available from
the official Kommander Web site at <a href="http://kommander.kdewebdev.org" target="_self">kommander.kdewebdev.org</a>.

It's frightfully easy to use. Select the Password length and the number
of passwords you want to generate, and then click Generate. You can 
cut and paste your new password into whatever application requires a
password change. You also can save those passwords to a file by clicking
the Save to file check box and selecting a name. If you want your
password to use specific characters, check Modify Character Set,
and enter your characters. The default uses the ten digits as well as
the 26 letters in uppercase and lowercase&mdash;just like that, totally
random passwords. Increase the password length, and your passwords will
be even more secure.
</p><p>
The only catch&mdash;and this is the catch with any random, non-pronounceable
password&mdash;is that the passwords are hard to remember, which, sadly,
leads to people writing them down and potentially compromising
security. How do we deal with this problem? 
</p><p>
Tarek Saidi's KeePassX is a great place for this information. This
password manager and data safe provides a secure location for your
vast collection of user names and passwords. It's also a cross-platform
application that runs under Mac OS X and Windows too. If, like many people,
you work on multiple systems and need access to your information,
you can copy the database to a USB key and carry it with you. To get
and start using KeePassX, visit <a href="http://keepassx.sourceforge.net" target="_self">keepassx.sourceforge.net</a>,
or check your distribution's repositories for prebuilt packages
(some binary packages are available at the KeePassX Web site).
</p><p>
When you start KeePassX the first time, you'll see that it is divided
into two main panes. The left pane is labeled Groups. To the
right, in the larger section, are headings for Title, Username, URL
and so on. To begin, you need to create a new password database. Click
File on the menu bar, and select New Database. A dialog appears asking
for a password, which you must enter twice (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9926f2.large.jpg"><img src="9926f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Before you can store anything
in KeePassX, you need a database. You can create multiple databases if
you want.
</p></div></div><p>
The database itself is encrypted using 256-bit AES by default, but you
also can select 256-bit Twofish. The number of rounds to encrypt is 6,000,
making this a very safe place for your personal information. However, don't
ever forget that master password. If you want to change the encryption
format or the number of rounds, click File and select Database Properties
from the menu bar.
</p><p>
The next step is to enter a group. Click Edit on the menu bar and select
Add New Group. The Group Properties dialog appears (Figure 3). This
is purely informational and serves as a folder for storing passwords.
So, enter a title that means something to you, then select an icon from
the drop-down list. Click OK when you are done.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9926f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. When
creating a group, you can select an icon to represent the type of
information you are storing.
</p></div></div><p>
You can create as many of these as you like with names like System
passwords, Family PCs (if you are doing the administration on your
family's systems), Customer systems and so on. The groups will appear
in the Groups column. Select a group, click Edit on the menu bar and
then select Add New Entry (or click the plus sign on the icon bar). The
Edit Entry window appears (Figure 4). The Group is 
selected automatically, but if you want, you can choose another at this point. Enter
a title to identify the entry, then enter your user name and password
information. As you enter your password, the quality of the password
is analyzed and reported on the Quality bar. You can add a comment
if you like, but it isn't necessary. Additionally, you can select an
expiration date, attach a file or simply click OK if you are done.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9926f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Add
a password entry to your KeePassX safe.
</p></div></div><p>
Look closely to the right of the Password Repet. field, and you'll see a
button labeled Gen. Given the earlier programs we've looked at, this might
sound interesting, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? Click the button, and a password generator
appears (Figure 5). KeePassX's password generator allows you
to define what characters are included in your password, such as the
use of special characters, spaces and so on. You also can define the
password length; the default is a difficult-to-crack 20 characters.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9926f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. If you
prefer, KeePassX can generate a password for you.
</p></div></div><p>
Click Generate and your password appears in the New Password field. If
you like what you see, click Accept. In some ways, this brings us back
to where we started, using a tool to generate secure passwords rather
than relying on common words or phrases.
</p><p>
Later, when restarting the program, KeePassX challenges you with
your master password before giving you access to the safe. If you are
the sort of person who needs a tool like KeePassX, you also will have
numerous passwords to look through when checking for a login you haven't
used in ages. For that inevitable day, KeePassX provides a quick search
feature, right on the main window at the far right of the icon bar
(Figure 6). Enter one or more words in your title or comments, then
press Enter. To see the actual password, double-click on the result,
then click the ... button next to the hidden password.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9926f6.large.jpg"><img src="9926f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. A quick search
field is available at the top right of the icon bar. Simply enter part of
your title, press Enter and your information is located quickly.

I can see that closing time has arrived, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. Given
Fran&ccedil;ois' penchant for exposing sensitive information, I may do the locking
up myself tonight. Even though I poke fun at Fran&ccedil;ois, he still is the
best waiter I've ever employed and an artist when it comes to opening
and pouring wine. In that, I trust him completely. Please, Fran&ccedil;ois,
take a moment to refill our guests' glasses a final time. Raise your
glasses, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, and let us all drink to one another's health.
