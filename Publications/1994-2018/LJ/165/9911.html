Eric Raymond has played a key role in the history of open source. In 1997,
he published <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</em></span>
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>CatB</em></span>), his seminal analysis
of why the open-source development approach works so well. He was one
of a group who came up with the term open source and, until 2005, was
President of the Open Source Initiative (OSI), which he co-founded.
After years as one of computing's most vocal and colorful characters,
Raymond has been conspicuous by his absence recently. He tells Glyn
Moody why, looks back over the ten years since <span   class="emphasis"><em>CatB</em></span> was published,
and forward to the future of open source and its ideas.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
GM: I can't quite remember the point when you were there and then you
weren't, but things have been rather quiet from you recently on the open-source front. What have you been up to?</b></span>
</p><p>
ESR: I've been keeping a low profile for a number of reasons, some
of which I can't talk about but expect to go public with within the
next few months. Among the reasons I <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> talk about it is that I made
a strategic decision ten years ago not to try to be the indispensable
man. That meant at some point I was going to have to 
step away from various leadership roles deliberately, and I did that (notably by
resigning from the presidency of OSI).
</p><p>
I was a historian before I was an activist, and one of the things
I've paid attention to are patterns of success and failure in reform
movements. One of the things I've observed is movements that
remain dependent on the talents and charisma of key individuals don't
survive those individuals. In fact, if your charismatic founder doesn't
step offstage, healthy reform movements often end up having to ritually
execute, banish or disgrace him/her in order to build themselves properly
into sustainable institutions.
</p><p>
So one of the things I've been up to is doing nothing, letting myself slip
out of the public eye and watching the movement mature. I still do a lot
of programming, as I always did. Two of my recent projects have been gpsd
(a GPS monitoring d&aelig;mon) and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Battle For Wesnoth</em></span> (a rather spiffy fantasy
combat game). I still occasionally talk to reporters, and I've done a
fair amount of behind-the-scenes work that's important to the community,
including some things I still have to be mysterious about for a bit.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
GM: Do you have any plans to add your voice to the debate more frequently
in the future?</b></span>
</p><p>
ESR: I've un-stealthed a little in the last few months. I haven't yet
decided how much more visible I want to get. In truth, I never really
<span   class="emphasis"><em>liked</em></span> being famous, which is why I find it more entertaining than
infuriating to be accused (as I sometimes am) of being a monster of ego
or an attention junkie. Fame was never more than an instrument for me, and
it's ridiculously easy to get; if I decide it's tactically necessary again,
I'll just fire up the same techniques I used a decade ago and take it.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
GM: Looking back over the ten years since <span class="emphasis"><em>CatB</em></span> was published, what surprises
you most about your analysis and its effects?</b></span>
</p><p>
ESR: There was a day in early 1998 that Netscape open-sourced Mozilla, and I
thought out the strategy I've been following ever since. Nothing since
then has surprised me much. Details, yes, like IBM being the major Fortune
100 ally that stepped up, or the fact that our best shot at the end-user
desktop came out of the brain of a former space tourist from South Africa.
</p><p>
But the broad trends, not. For example, I wrote in 1999 that I expected
us to have basically won our technical argument for the superior
quality of open source by about 2003, and that happened pretty much on
schedule. Since then, the arguments you hear against it are mostly about
transition costs and lack of a road map. That's a heck of a victory.
</p><p>
The <span   class="emphasis"><em>reason</em></span> I haven't been surprised much is that I understand the rise
of open source as being driven by long-term trends that go much deeper
than hacker ideology or intercorporate rivalries or any of the other
colorful stuff that tends to preoccupy people. Even the dot-com boom
and the following bust didn't perturb those trend-lines noticeably.
</p><p>
The deep drivers come from things like scaling laws, the way that various
different costs and payoff functions in software design shift in response
to hardware getting ever less expensive. Linus Torvalds and RMS and I
are chips on that wave; we didn't create it, we rode it.
</p><p>
Here's an example of the sort of thing I mean: the Vista flop. Completely
predictable, didn't surprise me for a nanosecond, and not because I
think Microsoft is staffed by incompetents either. It's not; it
hires some of the brightest programmers in the world. But, as I've been
explaining for ten years, there's a scale regime above which closed-source
development is unsustainable as the ratio between productive work and
complexity-management overhead rises. Microsoft was bound to reach it;
the only question was when.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
GM: What do you think are the most important new lessons we have learned
in the last ten years about how open source works?</b></span>
</p><p>
ESR: I'm not sure we've learned anything fundamental, which actually
disappoints me somewhat&mdash;I expected my original theoretical models and
language to have been thoroughly superseded by now with better ones, and
they haven't been. Actually, <span   class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> might count as my biggest surprise
since 1998.
</p><p>
That being said, there have been a lot of evolutionary developments
that really matter. Our technical toolkits have improved markedly, and
so has individual and social consciousness about how to use them. One
good example is the rise of project workbenches like SourceForge and
Gna and Berlios; another is the shift now underway from centralized
to decentralized version-control systems; and a third is the clever
ways development groups are finding to use IRC as a complement to and
replacement of traditional e-mail channels.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
GM: How do you think the open-source tribe differs today from the one
you wrote about ten years ago, or the one that existed even further back?
Do those differences matter?</b></span>
</p><p>
ESR: Oh yes, they certainly do. The two big ones are that we're
<span   class="emphasis"><em>conscious</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>unified</em></span> now in a way we weren't before. That sounds
like a fuzzy feel-goodism, like political rhetoric, but it's actually
a sharp fact with hard, measurable consequences, and it may actually be
the most interesting thing I can talk about in this interview.
</p><p>
Before <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</em></span>, open-source development was a folk
practice, a set of working methods evolved unconsciously by hackers who
had no theory about why the things they were doing actually worked. It
didn't have a name&mdash;and no, &ldquo;free software&rdquo; wasn't it, because that
label was about ideology and goals rather than working methods and
communications structures.
</p><p>
After <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</em></span>, we got conscious. We woke up. We
started <span   class="emphasis"><em>reflecting on what we were doing</em></span> and deliberately trying
to improve our process efficiency. One measurable consequence of that
is the toolkit changes I just listed. These are things that happened
because hackers reflected on the open-source process with the conscious
intention of improving it.
</p><p>
The &ldquo;unified&rdquo; part&mdash;the Open Source community has a sense of itself now
that has become steadily more important relative to membership in what
used to be more loosely connected subtribes&mdash;Perl programmers, Emacs
fans, Linux users, BSD users, pro- or anti-GPL zealots, whatever. While
those affiliations are still important and spawn way too many flamewars,
the overarching &ldquo;open-source&rdquo; affiliation is now much more important
for almost everyone in those subtribes.
</p><p>
There are two ways to look at that shift. One truth is that I
engineered it as part of my sinister master plan for world domination,
bwahahaha. There are specific things I did, like founding OSI and some
choices I made in my early propaganda and people I chose and groomed for
leadership positions, that were designed to unify the community and did,
in fact, have that effect.
</p><p>
One insignia of the success of my meme-hacking (insert more demented
mad-scientist-type cackling here) is the effect on tribes like the BSD
people and the X developers, who weren't part of the Linux community to
which I addressed my original propaganda. They have not only enlisted
themselves into today's Open Source community, they've also reinterpreted
their own pre-1997 histories into open-source language and categories!
</p><p>
The equal and opposite truth is that this was bound to happen sooner
or later; you can only sleepwalk for so long before you stumble over
something and wake up&mdash;and the open-source process is not just more
important than any of the specific tools or languages or operating systems
we apply with it, it's <span   class="emphasis"><em>obviously</em></span> more important. So it's not surprising
that people's allegiances and self-identifications have shifted; if
I hadn't social-engineered that, someone else would have. Later
and more slowly, maybe, but I'm certain it would have happened without
me eventually.
</p><p>
Significantly, the only subtribe that has even tried to maintain a strong
identity in opposition to open source is the more extreme wing of the
FSF crowd&mdash;and that is precisely because they believe ideology and
goals are more important than working methods.
</p><p>
For me, the working method
<span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> the ideology. Our practice is more
powerful than our preaching. What really persuades are deeds and
results. Or, as I've sometimes put it: talk is cheap, shut up and show
them the code.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
GM: One remarkable change in the last decade has been the rise of Google,
a company built almost entirely on top of open-source software, which
employs some of the top hackers and promotes the training of a new
hacker generation through its Summer of Code. What do you think are the
good and bad aspects of Google as far as open source is
concerned?</b></span>
</p><p>
ESR: I have the same concerns everyone else does. On the one hand,
Google is an important patron of the community and has been on the right
side of a lot of battles. On the other hand, the concentration of power
it's acquiring is enough to make anyone uneasy, and I'm disturbed
by the way the founders' political slant has sometimes compromised the
neutrality of the channel&mdash;the generally leftish tilt of Google News'
source selection, for example, or the fact that it won't let you sell
firearms through Google Ads. And yes, I'd be just as unhappy if it were
conservative dogma apparently manifesting, or even my own off-the-spectrum
radical libertarianism. For a company in Google's position,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> political
partisanship outside narrow issues connected to free speech is an abuse
of trust.
</p><p>
I'm optimistic, though. Markets correct this sort of thing. One
consequence of the Internet is that they're doing it faster all the time,
especially for information goods. Microsoft will probably have been
the last of the long-lived information monopolies; if Google is seen to
emulate, say, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>New York Times</em></span>' combination of left-wing partisanship
with unconvincing denials of same, I have no doubt that we'll see some
countervailing equivalent of Fox News spun up in fairly short order.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
GM: The rise of Google has added to Microsoft's difficulties, since it
must now fight on two fronts....</b></span>
</p><p>
ESR: Exactly...and an important subtlety here is that the desktop-Linux
and Google-Web-services attacks are <span   class="emphasis"><em>different</em></span>. They're not just in
defense on two business fronts, they have to beat two strongly divergent
technical approaches with one platform. Tough lines.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
GM: Microsoft's response to open source has been highly schizophrenic. How
do you expect all this to pan out: what will Microsoft do, and what will
it become?</b></span>
</p><p>
ESR: If I had good answers to that, I'd go play the stock market and be
rich. I can see the underlying trends like scaling laws clearly, but
surface phenomena, like the rise and fall of individual corporations, have
too much noise and time-jitter in them.
</p><p>
The only thing I'm sure of is that Microsoft's days of being able to
ship competitive software from closed source are numbered, let alone
its days of maintaining monopoly lock-in. The Vista stall-out, and the
scaling phenomena beneath it, guarantee that.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
GM: What do you see as the big trends in open source at the
moment?</b></span>
</p><p>
ESR: My friend Rob Landley and I wrote
a paper a year ago (&ldquo;World Domination 201&rdquo;,
<a href="http://catb.org/~esr/writings/world-domination/world-domination-201.html" target="_self">catb.org/~esr/writings/world-domination/world-domination-201.html</a>),
on how the transition to 64-bit hardware opened a critical window of
opportunity for mass Linux adoption that is likely to close sometime
in 2008. The two most interesting things to happen since are that 1)
the hardware trend curves we looked at have been tracking our predictions
like they were on rails, and 2) the two major opponents we were worried
about have both been falling out.
</p><p>
Vista is a flop, and Apple is steaming away from the desktop market as
fast as it can&mdash;it took &ldquo;Computer&rdquo; out of its corporate name a
few months ago and now seems to want to be all about iPods and cell phones
and media, oh my. Can't blame Apple; profit margins and volumes are both
higher in those markets.
</p><p>
This means there's a huge Ubuntu-shaped power vacuum opening up in
the desktop market. (A year ago, I thought it might be Linspire, but
Linspire blew it big-time on several levels. One of those was soliciting
strategic advice from me, swearing to follow it, and then doing the
exact opposite.) If Mark Shuttleworth and his merry crew at Canonical
don't blow it, we're going to win. And Ubuntu seems to me to be doing
the right things, like hassle-free support for the evil proprietary
multimedia codecs that nontechnical end users actually want.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, not blowing it requires not just doing the right things
but doing them fast enough. Time is getting tight. We have at
<span   class="emphasis"><em>most</em></span>
another year before the market settles on the dominant desktop OS for the
64-bit era. That's not a lot of release cycles even at open-source speed.
</p><p>
We're <span   class="emphasis"><em>so</em></span> close. If we had even another nine months on
the window, I
don't think I'd be worried. As it is, it's going to be a damned near-run
thing either way.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
GM: As open-source commoditizes more and more of the software stack,
do you think that free software will run out of big challenges and will
eventually turn into a kind of mopping-up operation, filling in the
holes?</b></span>
</p><p>
ESR: No more so than software in general. One clue as to why is that
&ldquo;commoditizing&rdquo; turns out to be an extremely misleading term for what's
actually going on. I'm writing a paper on that; it's called &ldquo;The Art
of Commodity&rdquo;. I think it may surprise people as much as my last one,
&ldquo;The Magic Cauldron&rdquo;, did.
</p><p>
I'm not going to go into this in a lot of detail right now except
to point you and your readers at the same source that started me
thinking: Brent Williams' &ldquo;Open Source Business Models: A Wall Street
Look at a Wild 2006 and the Prospects for Even More Fun in 2007&rdquo;
(<a href="http://stephesblog.blogs.com/presentations/BrentWilliamsEclipseConV02.pdf" target="_self">stephesblog.blogs.com/presentations/BrentWilliamsEclipseConV02.pdf</a>).
</p><p>
This guy is a stock analyst who noticed something <span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> interesting
about the open-source software market, but lacked the tech background
to understand the true significance of the anomaly he spotted.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
GM: On a related note, do you think it is possible that the most
exciting open-source projects will be those outside software&mdash;that is,
the application of open-source ideas to content, business, science,
politics and so forth? Do you see evidence of that happening already?</b></span>
</p><p>
ESR: Well, there's the open-access movement in scientific publishing. The
principals in that one are very explicit about their debt to the
open-source movement in software, which kind of closes a circle, because
one of my key insights was that open-source development harnesses the
effects of decentralized peer review the way scientists are supposed to
do it.
</p><p>
Politics: I recently read that New Zealand is inviting the public to
rewrite a fundamental part of its legal code on a wiki. Business on
content: the company that owns <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></span> released its stuff
under an open-content license a few years back. (The funny part about
that is it credited me with inspiring the move but probably had
no idea that I was a <span   class="emphasis"><em>D&amp;D</em></span> player from waaaay back, like the 1974 first
edition. I still have that original rule set in my basement.)
</p><p>
There are polyps of open-source thinking sprouting all over the place. But, most exciting? Not to me. I'm a programmer. Software is what I do,
and the increasing pervasiveness of the Internet means that the effects
of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>software</em></span> open-source movement will be felt everywhere.
</p><p>
There's also the problem that, unfortunately, most of the people who work
themselves into a lather about applying open-source principles elsewhere
are...well, let's be gentle and simply note that their idealism tends
to greatly exceed their grasp of consequences.
</p><p>
But ask me again in another ten years; my answer might change.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
GM: What do you think the open-source approach can offer to help solve the
big challenges facing humanity and the planet today&mdash;things like climate
change, sea acidification, water shortages, resource depletion and so on?</b></span>
</p><p>
ESR: It's obvious. Planned economies, rigid authority hierarchies, closed
and secretive decision procedures&mdash;they don't cope with situations
of ambiguity, uncertainty and rapid changes in requirements well, if at
all. They're maladaptive because their decision processes get captured
by what political economists call &ldquo;agency problems&rdquo;.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Every single one</em></span> of the problems you listed has market-based,
decentralist, open-system solutions that are superior to anything a
top-down planner or bureaucrat would ever come up with. The danger
isn't that we'll fail to respond, it's that we'll get locked in to
&ldquo;solutions&rdquo; that do more harm than good simply because they fit somebody's
centralizing, authoritarian political agenda.
</p><p>
If you want a largest lesson from open source, here's mine: trust
decentralization over centralization, voluntarism over coercion, bottom-up
over top-down, adaptation over planning, openness over secrecy, practice
over ideology, and markets over politics. Freedom works. Now go
<span   class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> it!
