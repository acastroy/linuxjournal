Trolltech's Qtopia SXE takes a stab at making open-source phones more
secure.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb6e580.0xc66240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
No one wants an insecure system, especially on a mobile or VoIP
phone. Both users and operators want to feel confident that their phones
won't be used secretly to send thousands of spam messages or viruses
or to transfer huge files. Linux in the mobile space opens doors to
everyone&mdash;including developers of malicious code. A locked-down and secure system
does not necessarily mean the source code is closed.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9896f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
The last thing people want on their phones is a malware application
that secretly sends their details somewhere or launches a DOS attack
using their costly GPRS account. Together with the Linux Intrusion
Detection System (LIDS), Trolltech's Safe Execution Environment (SXE)
delivers a safe environment in which to allow untrusted applications to
be executed. Without SXE and LIDS, an unsuspecting user could install an
unknown package. This could launch Qtopia's QCop, which handles Qtopia's
interprocess communication (IPC) with LD_PRELOAD set to its own libc
library. This means that its own code is loaded instead of the known
libc in the system, which could have disastrous results on the user's data,
or worse, disrupt emergency communications.
</p><p>
Trolltech has an answer.
</p><p>
Trolltech recently announced the GPL version of Qtopia that includes
SXE, as well as telephony libraries needed for GSM and VoIP-enabled
phones. Trolltech has spent many person-hours developing SXE to help
ensure that both operators and users are confident about installing
native compiled applications. I say person-hours here because the
lead developer for much of SXE's life was Sarah Smith&mdash;Trolltech's first
female developer.
</p><p>
SXE is a little like a firewall. It prevents applications from accessing
unauthorized services and hardware through domain controls. It goes
beyond just plain sandboxing applications, which can blindly deny
programs access to system resources. It applies policy rules for each
program component and IPC. Qtopia applications send an IPC or QCop
message when they want to open a window or send an SMS.
</p><p>
Upon installation, an application specifies what security domains
are needed to function and is sandboxed by Qtopia. If the program is
executed and then tries to access services beyond what it has been
awarded, a security breach is logged, and the application is terminated and
disabled. A dialog and SMS message are issued to the user regarding 
the breach. LIDS can complete the safe environment by controlling
access to hardware, system-level services, programs and files.
</p><p>
The Qtopia Greenphone is an example of a working SXE and LIDS
implementation, and this article discusses Qtopia version 4.3.0. The
Qtopia open-source version, announced recently for the FIC's open-source
Neo phone, also would benefit from SXE and a LIDS-enabled kernel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb6e580.0xc66818"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
Although sales of the Greenphone have been discontinued, support and
development for it has not&mdash;neither has development of SXE for Qtopia.
In this article, I use the Greenphone mainly as an example.
</p><p>
Trolltech is advising people interested in an open Qtopia phone, to
purchase an FIC Neo 1973, as it has ported Qtopia to that device and plans
on supporting an SDK in the same light as the Greenphone SDK, scheduled
to be released with the 4.3.1 release.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb6e580.0xc66a80"></a>
Application Development</h2></div></div><p>
An SXE application starts with a developer creating a Qtopia application
and packaging it in a Qpkg, which is based on the Itsy Package, but
has a few security issues resolved. Namely, Qtopia does not allow an
application install to run arbitrary scripts, but also, the package
must specify which domains it needs access to in order to run. Qtopia then allows
(or denies) that package only those domains that it requests.
</p><p>
An SXE domain is simply a name for an allowed access rights policy. Some
of the default domains and their access rights in Qtopia are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
docapi: user documents.
</p></li><li><p>
pim: Personal Information Management data.
</p></li><li><p>
window: graphic display.
</p></li><li><p>
graphics: full-screen graphics display.
</p></li><li><p>
net: access to WAP, GSM and GPRS.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Qtopia
uses many more domains, and some of them, such as the base domain, should never be allowed
access by any untrusted application. Operators or integrators can use
the default Qtopia domains or create their own.
</p><p>
The third-party developer then specifies, in the package control file,
in which domains the application needs to function. Much like a legacy
ipkg, a qpk is simply a gzipped tarball of the file structure where the
application lives, a desktop file much like those used in KDE and GNOME,
plus a control file that specifies parameters, such as the application's
name, maintainer, domain, file size and so forth.
</p><p>
The Greenphone SDK makes this easy with the use of the gph script, which
can configure, compile, build the package and install or run it on the
Greenphone. The developer needs to know only which domains the application
is going to use. Starting a debug build of Qtopia in SXE_DISCOVERY_MODE,
with SXE logging turned on, can help log these domain requests and
subsequent denials. There is a significant performance decrease while
running in discovery mode. It is only for the debugging process and not
a final release. The developer then can add the appropriate domains to
the application's .pro file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb6e580.0xc67108"></a>
Installation Time</h2></div></div><p>
After configuring the Package Manager to see the feed server, Qtopia
reads a plain-text file named packages.list on the server. This file
contains a list of all the packages available on the server, the domains
the package is requesting, as well as the description, name, maintainer,
size, license and md5sum of every package.
</p><p>
When users want to install a new package, they select it from a
list. Users then are prompted with a dialog containing the specific
domains that the application is asking to access (Figure 2).
Users have a choice whether or not to install. The
package then is downloaded to temporary storage, installed
and sandboxed. By default, the untrusted packages live in
/home/Packages, with the md5sum used as a directory name&mdash;for example,
home/Packages/1e67fa93917fedb17f575fe0f2ee2cd8/bin/screenshot.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9896f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Package Installation
</p></div></div><p>
The Packages directory has a file structure, such as bin/lib/pics/,
that symlinks to where the real binaries live. These symlinks use the
md5sum in the name, such as 1e67fa93917fedb17f575fe0f2ee2cd8_screenshot
&rarr; ../1e67fa93917fedb17f575fe0f2ee2cd8/bin/screenshot.
</p><p>
This file path is known to Qtopia, so it can find your shiny new
application, and then adds it to the main applications list. This
information now lives in the Qtopia content database. In previous
versions of Qtopia, all this data simply lived in the filesystem, and
Qtopia scanned to find the applications. The Package Manager then runs
the sxe_sandbox script to create the LIDS rules for this application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb6e580.0xc674d0"></a>
Runtime</h2></div></div><p>
Users start an untrusted application by clicking on its icon
from the main menu. In Qtopia versions previous to 4.3.0, the untrusted
and installed applications were accessible from the Installed Packages
application. To make sure an application tries to access only the domains it was
granted, Qtopia monitors service access requests with SXEMonitor. If the
application tries to access something it did not initially request, such
as the phonecomm domain, a breach is registered (Figure 3).
The application is terminated, and Qtopia alerts the user with a dialog.
It also, however, sends the user an SMS message directly to the Messages inbox. If
this application continues to create breaches, Qtopia disables the
program completely.

</p></div></div><p>
LIDS plays an integral part in all this. SXE works together with LIDS
policies to make sure files that should not be accessible are not
accessed. You must have LIDS enabled in the kernel to take
advantage of SXE. The Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system in LIDS
controls lower-level filesystem access. Without it, Qtopia can deny
applications access to Qtopia services and tasks in the domain policies,
but there would be nothing stopping an application from changing those
access rights to something more advantageous for a malicious application.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9896f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Security Info Showing SXE and LIDS Status
</p></div></div><p>
A number of script templates ship with Qtopia, which live
in etc/sxe_qtopia, that help with the creation of LIDS rules during both
the root filesystem creation and package installation. The
LIDS-enabled Greenphone writes these policy rules during the first boot
after a flash of a system update. An operator can, of course, do this
to the filesystem before deployment.
</p><p>
When integrators create a new application or service, they need to
add them to Qtopia's etc/sxe.profiles file. This file contains a list of
domains and the services and QCop messages associated with them. It is
processed by Qtopia at install time to create SXE policies. Integrators
also might need to add it to the Package Manager's source code, so it can
display the domain's verbose characteristics to the user. This helps 
users make at least a knowledgeable choice as to whether to install the
package.
</p><p>
Qtopia.net has two feeds set up with simulated malware packages to test,
for both the 4.3.0 Greenphone
(<a href="http://qtopia.net/packages/feed/4.3/greenphone" target="_self">qtopia.net/packages/feed/4.3/greenphone</a>) and its SDK
(<a href="http://qtopia.net/packages/feed/4.3/sdk" target="_self">qtopia.net/packages/feed/4.3/sdk</a>). There,
you can get the latest Greenphone SDK to try out yourself
(Figure 6).

</p></div></div><p>
To enable a LIDS kernel, download the LIDS patches from
the LIDS Web site, build the patched kernel, build the LIDS filesystem and configure the policy scripts. Qtopia comes with scripts
to help define LIDS policies based on domains. For example, the script
etc/sxe_domains/sxe_qtopia_bluetooth creates a LIDS rule like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
lidsconf -A POSTBOOT -s ${BIN} -o LIDS_SOCKET_CREATE -j ENABLE
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb6e580.0x1060220"></a></h2></div></div><p>
for
applications that are granted access to the Bluetooth domain.
</p><p>
I won't go into the gory details of creating LIDS policies, but more
information can be found at the LIDS Web site (<a href="http://lids.org" target="_self">lids.org</a>) and in
the Trolltech documentation (<a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/qtopia4.3/sxe.html" target="_self">doc.trolltech.com/qtopia4.3/sxe.html</a>).
</p><p>
SXE and LIDS can make your Linux phone more enjoyable and worry-free by
giving you the confidence that untrusted applications you download will
do only the things they are allowed to do.
