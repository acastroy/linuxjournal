  <h3>Red Hat Alpha</h3>

  <p><i>by Retro</i></p>

  <p>My firewall box is an ancient 233 MHz DEC Multia. Don't let the clock speed fool you, it's a memory pig and not much faster than a Pentium 75. Aside from workstation performance that was impressive in 1994, it has been a real trouper, logging 90 days or more uptime between reboots, an utterly stable firewall that cost me thousands less than any competing product would have. Linux's built-in firewalling/IP_masquerade code is stronger and cheaper, if less friendly, than that available on NT and Solaris.</p>

  <p>Downloading the Red Hat 5.0 Alpha release from Red Hat's primary FTP site took about 14 hours over 128K ISDN line. I used <tt>wget&lt;\!s&gt;-m</tt> (a GNU utility not included in the base Red Hat distribution) to pull down an exact duplicate of the Red Hat 5.0 directory tree. You can also use <b>ncftp</b> (bundled with Red Hat) with the <tt>-R</tt> option. If you are behind a firewall, you have to configure it to use PASV mode first.</p>

  <p>CuteFTP and WinFTP32 for Windows 95/NT are also capable of doing this sort of mirroring, so don't think you need a Linux box just to download your free copy of Red Hat.</p>

  <p>For those of you using a PPP modem or an ISDN connection, it's probably faster (and for those of you using metered lines, cheaper) to order the CD-ROM from Red Hat's convenient on-line ordering facility.</p>

  <p>Unlike my friend's experiences, my upgrade to Red Hat Alpha completed with no trouble; however, my configuration was vastly simpler.</p>

  <h3>More Than One Way to Firewall</h3>

  <p>The Alpha installation process is still relegated to a pair of poorly written appendices in the manual. Red Hat's default kernel does not have firewalling completely enabled, so I had to first reconfigure the kernel.</p>

  <p>Since I was going to have to wait an hour while my Alpha's kernel rebuilt anyway, I wanted to get its sound configured and working on this build as well. (I use the machine for network monitoring, and I wanted it to &ldquo;speak up&rdquo; whenever there was a problem, rather than beep.)</p>

  <p>This was a bootstrapping problem&mdash;you can't get to the Red Hat mailing list archive to research your firewall box if your firewall box is down. So I configured <b>named</b>, uncommented the http Proxy support and added the correct <tt>ServerName</tt> to the /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file, restarted httpd, then proxied my browser to the firewall box&mdash;I now had full web support without IP masquerading.</p>

  <p>RealAudio isn't included in the DEC Alpha release, which is too bad as the floating-point performance of the Alpha would probably improve the quality of live RealAudio encoding. Aside from these omissions, the Alpha release has the same features as the Intel version.</p>

  <p>The Alpha worked fine until it was taken out by a lightning hit. Anybody got a spare power supply for this little workhorse?</p>
