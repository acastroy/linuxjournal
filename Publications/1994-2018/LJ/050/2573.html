    Need to transfer files between your desktop and your laptop?
    Here's the easy way to do it by networking.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf7580.0xeef450"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you have two computers running Linux,
one of which is a notebook, you are most likely tired of exchanging
data between them using floppy disks. This article explains how to
quickly set up these two computers so that you can use networking
instead. Don't be afraid if you have no prior knowledge of
networking; just follow the instructions step by step. If you have
successfully installed Linux by yourself on your computer, you will
be able to do this as well.
</p><p>I'll start by setting up a PLIP (Parallel Line Internet
Protocol) connection, which is simply a network connection through
the parallel port. This port is most often used to connect a
printer, and it is most probably located at the back of your
computer. It has a connector with 25 holes. You will need a special
cable to make this connection. Once made, you will have a full
network connection allowing you to use
<span   class="bold"><b>ftp</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>rcp</b></span> to transfer files between the
computers.</p><p>Next, I'll discuss using NFS and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mounting</em></span> the disk of the notebook computer on
the desktop computer. In this way, the disk of the notebook
computer will appear as if it were a local disk on your desktop
computer, and you can manipulate (edit, copy, etc.) your notebook
files using your favorite commands.</p><p>Finally, I will show you how to access the Internet through
PLIP from the notebook computer if your desktop computer has
Internet access.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf7580.0xeef768"></a>Assumptions and Conventions</h2></div></div><p>I am using the Slackware 3.2 distribution of Linux (kernel
2.0.27), so if you have another distribution, some interpolation
may be necessary&mdash;in particular, for the kernel configuration and
the location of the system files. You will need the
following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>two computers with Slackware 3.2&mdash;generic Slackware
kernel&mdash;or your favorite Linux distribution</p></li><li><p>root access on both computers</p></li><li><p>your own account on both computers (with same UID
for NFS)</p></li><li><p>TCP/IP package installed</p></li><li><p>parallel port <b  >plip1</b> on each
computer (IO 0x378, IRQ 7)</p></li></ul></div><p>I will use the following conventions for commands:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>commands with prompt ending in <b  >#</b>
are issued as root</p></li><li><p>commands with prompt ending in
<b  >&gt;</b> are issued as an unprivileged user</p></li></ul></div><p>Finally, when editing files as root, remember to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span> make a backup copy of all configuration
files before you alter them during the configuration
process!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf7580.0xef0000"></a>Part 1. What is PLIP?</h2></div></div><p>PLIP is similar to SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol),
except that it uses a parallel cable for the connection. SLIP is
used for networking over serial lines (like modems, or the serial
ports of your computer, usually with 9-hole connectors). Your
printer and the PLIP connection cannot both be used at the same
time, since they both use the parallel port. However, our primary
goal is to have a temporary connection between the two computers,
and switching between the printer and the connection is quite easy.
You will have to connect/disconnect the cable manually, which may
involve crawling under your desk. If you do this often, you may
wish to consider buying a data switch box.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf7580.0xef0108"></a>Setting Up PLIP</h2></div></div><p>As already mentioned, the first thing you need is a
&ldquo;null-printer&rdquo; parallel cable, which is often sold under the name
&ldquo;Laplink&rdquo; cable or &ldquo;PC-to-PC&rdquo; cable. It is cheap (about $10 US)
and easy to find in any computer store. There are also instructions
on how to build one yourself in the NET-2-HOWTO, but I don't think
it is worth the trouble and you could end up damaging your parallel
port if you make a mistake&mdash;so just buy one.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf7580.0xef0210"></a>Check the Kernel</h2></div></div><p>Next, check your kernel. If you are using the distribution
kernel that came with your Slackware 3.2 distribution, then you're
all set. (If you don't know which kernel you are using, then you
probably just have the generic one.) If not, check that you have
loadable module support, networking support, PLIP and printer
support as a module (no built-in printer support). If you have to
recompile the kernel, then check the appropriate documentation and
make sure to turn on these options:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CONFIG_MODULES=y
CONFIG_NET=y
CONFIG_INET=y
CONFIG_NETDEVICES=y
CONFIG_PLIP=m
CONFIG_PRINTER=m
</pre><p>Recompiling the kernel is not hard. You need to know what
hardware you have and understand what all the options mean. Check
the Kernel-HOWTO and the Documentation/Config.help file that comes
with the kernel sources. If you have to recompile the kernel, first
read this entire article, because later I will mention some
additional options you may want to turn on.
</p><p>With the correct options for the kernel, start the
configuration, taking the following steps (as described in the next
two sections):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Check for modules in /etc/rc.d/rc.modules and
update /etc/hosts.</p></li><li><p>Write scripts to start/stop the connection.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf7580.0xef05d8"></a>Network Setup</h2></div></div><p>You have to be root to edit the files. On both computers, in
/etc/rc.d/rc.modules, comment out the line enabling printer
support. (To comment out a statement in the file, just put the
<b  >#</b> character at the beginning of the line.) For
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#/sbin/modprobe lp
</pre><p>Check that PLIP support is also commented out.
<pre     class="programlisting">
#/sbin/modprobe plip
</pre>


I will load/unload the modules as needed from script files. Choose
names for the two computers; I will call the desktop computer
&ldquo;zeus&rdquo;, and the notebook &ldquo;hermes&rdquo;. (Hermes was the god of
travel and business in Ancient Greece, and Zeus was his &ldquo;boss&rdquo;,
being the god of the sky and master of all gods.) On both zeus and
hermes, edit the file /etc/hosts and add the following two lines:
<pre     class="programlisting">
192.168.93.1     zeus
192.168.93.2     hermes
</pre>


The addresses 192.168.93.xxx are safe to use; they will not
conflict with existing addresses unless you already have a local
network using these addresses. These IP addresses follow the
convention for IP addressing: they are used only for local
networks. (See NET-2-HOWTO and RFC1597 for more information.) You
could skip this step and use the numeric addresses, but it is
easier to remember zeus and hermes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf7580.0xef0898"></a>Scripts</h2></div></div><p>On zeus, create the following script,
/usr/sbin/plip-on.sh:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
/sbin/modprobe -r lp
/sbin/modprobe plip
/sbin/ifconfig plip1 zeus pointopoint hermes up
/sbin/route add hermes dev plip1
</pre><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>modprobe</b></span> commands unload
module <b  >lp</b> (printer module) and load the
<b  >plip</b> module. (Actually, PLIP works on my system
with <b  >lp</b> loaded, but the available documentation
says it won't work; feel free to experiment.)
<span   class="bold"><b>ifconfig</b></span> is then run to set up the
network interface <b  >plip1</b>.
<span   class="bold"><b>route</b></span> tells the computer how to
find its way to the network; here, host hermes is located through
the network interface <b  >plip1</b>. Next, create the
following script, /usr/sbin/plip-off.sh:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
/sbin/route del hermes
/sbin/ifconfig plip1 down
/sbin/modprobe -r plip
/sbin/modprobe lp
</pre>


Similarly, on hermes, write the following script,
/usr/sbin/plip-on.sh:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
/sbin/modprobe -r lp
/sbin/modprobe plip
/sbin/ifconfig plip1 hermes pointopoint zeus up
/sbin/route add zeus dev plip1
/sbin/route add default gw zeus dev plip1
</pre>


The main difference between the plip-on.sh file on zeus is that I
have swapped <b  >zeus</b> and <b  >hermes</b>
throughout. I have also added a default route, that is, when a
connection (other than to zeus) is requested to the network, I use
<b  >plip1</b> by default. I need this default to connect
hermes to the Internet through zeus using masquerading as discussed
at the end of this article; for PLIP and NFS, it is not needed. Now
write the following script, /usr/sbin/plip-off.sh:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
/sbin/route del default
/sbin/route del zeus
/sbin/ifconfig plip1 down
/sbin/modprobe -r plip
/sbin/modprobe lp
</pre>


Remember to change permissions (<b  >chmod +x
plip-*.sh</b>) on both computers to make the scripts
executable. Now, you can plug in your cable and issue this command
(as root):
<pre     class="programlisting">
# /usr/sbin/plip-on
</pre>


on both zeus and hermes. (It does not matter on which you issue it
first.) You should now have full connectivity between zeus and
hermes. From hermes type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
hermes:~&gt; telnet zeus
</pre>


and log in to zeus. Congratulations. You have just set up your own
private local network.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf7580.0x12e9278"></a>Running the Scripts as root</h2></div></div><p>Working as root to run the scripts is not only annoying, it
is also potentially dangerous. You could easily damage your Linux
system by mistakenly removing files thus losing precious hours of
sometimes difficult and tedious customization. That's why you
should use the technique described in &ldquo;Safely Running Programs as
Root&rdquo; by Phil Hughes, <i  >Linux Journal</i> May 1997,
and create executables named
<span   class="bold"><b>plip-on</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>plip-off</b></span> with suid root to allow
any user to start and stop the connection. All the executables do
is run the scripts assuming root identity regardless of which user
runs them. Example source code is available at
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/linux-journal/listings/issue37
in the file 2114.tgz.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf7580.0x12e9488"></a>Transferring Files</h2></div></div><p>I now have a full network connection between zeus and hermes,
so all the network software will work (TELNET, FTP, rlogin, etc.).
Try to exchange files between the two computers using
<span   class="bold"><b>ftp</b></span>. (The FTP server is turned on
by default in Slackware; check the /etc/inetd.conf file and the man
pages for inetd(8), ftpd(8).) Quicker even than ftp, you can use
<span   class="bold"><b>rcp</b></span> (remote copy; see the man
pages rcp(1), rlogin(1), rsh(1)). The transfer rate that I get on
my systems is about 25KB per second using FTP.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf7580.0x12e9640"></a>Part 2. What is NFS?</h2></div></div><p>NFS (Networked File System) allows you to access remote file
systems of other computers through a network connection. In other
words, you can manipulate files on another computer directly, as if
they were files on your own computer. Your kernel must have NFS
support enabled (default on Slackware), and you need to run
programs (called &ldquo;daemons&rdquo;) which listen to the network for
connection requests and act accordingly when one is received. You
also need to specify which directories can be accessed and which
hosts are allowed to access them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf7580.0x12e9748"></a>Setting Up NFS</h2></div></div><p>NFS is an even better way to access files between the two
computers than using ftp or rcp. (To have NFS support enabled, the
option is CONFIG_NFS_FS=y; again, this is the default with
Slackware.) The setup described here allows you to consider the
disk of hermes as being a disk on zeus, thereby allowing you to
access all the files directly without having to log in (as with
ftp) or setting rhosts access (as with rcp). Before you start,
check your user identification number (UID) on both machines using
the command <span   class="bold"><b>id</b></span>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
zeus:~&gt; id
uid=401(zeusname) gid=100(users) groups=100(users)
hermes:~&gt; id
uid=401(hermname) gid=100(users) groups=100(users)
</pre><p>I will assume that both numbers to the right of &ldquo;uid=&rdquo;
match. (This number could be something other than 401.) If they do
not match, refer to the section ahead called &ldquo;If UIDs Don't
Match&rdquo;. Now take the following steps (described in the next three
sections):
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Start the RPC (remote procedure call) daemons in
the /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2 file.</p></li><li><p>Create a list of hermes directories to be
exported.</p></li><li><p>Mount the exported directories of hermes on
zeus.</p></li></ul></div>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf7580.0x12e9bc0"></a>RPC daemons</h2></div></div><p>On hermes, check that the
<span   class="bold"><b>rpc</b></span> daemons are launched in the
/etc/rc.d/rc.inet2 file. These daemons process the network requests
to handle NFS. They are launched by default in Slackware, so if you
haven't changed the re.inet2 file from the original distribution,
there is nothing to do, and you can skip the rest of this
section.</p><p>First, type <b  >ps a | grep rpc</b> to check that
the daemons are running. On my system, I get this output:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
hermes:~&gt; ps a | grep rpc
80  ?  S     0:00 /usr/sbin/rpc.mountd
83  ?  S     0:00 /usr/sbin/rpc.nfsd
74  ?  S     0:00 /usr/sbin/rpc.portmap
</pre><p>If they are not running, edit the /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2 file
(make a backup copy first) and append the lines:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/sbin/rpc.portmap
/usr/sbin/rpc.mountd
/usr/sbin/rpc.nfsd
</pre>


If you make any changes to the /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2 file, reboot the
computer and check to be sure the daemons are now running. These
commands could always be issued as root from the command line
instead of rebooting.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf7580.0x12e9ed8"></a>Exporting Directories</h2></div></div><p>On hermes, edit the /etc/exports file, which contains the
directories you wish to make accessible from zeus. You have to
choose which directories you want to export. You could just export
the root directory <b  >/</b>, thus exporting the whole
disk; but usually you just want to access the user files located in
/home, so in this example I export only /home. Add the following
line to the /etc/exports file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/home  zeus
</pre><p>See the exports(5) man page for the format of the file and
the available options. In particular, you will be able to write
from zeus onto hermes' disk; if you don't think this is a good
idea, use:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/home  zeus(ro)
</pre>


The option <b  >ro</b> stands for &ldquo;read-only&rdquo;. Notice
that user root cannot write on hermes' disk from zeus unless you
specifically allow it using the options described in exports(5).
You can add other directories, one on each line, using the same
syntax.
</p><p>Now tell the <span   class="bold"><b>nfsd</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>mountd</b></span> daemon that the exports
file has changed by sending them a signal using the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
hermes# killall -HUP rpc.nfsd rpc.mountd
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf7580.0x12ea2f8"></a>Mounting the Directories</h2></div></div><p>From zeus, you can check that hermes is now ready to export
by issuing the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
zeus# /usr/sbin/showmount -e hermes
Export list for hermes:
/home    zeus
</pre><p>Finally, on zeus, chose a &ldquo;mount point&rdquo;; this is just an
empty directory that you will use to access the remote directory on
hermes. I suggest:
<pre     class="programlisting">
zeus# mkdir /nfs
zeus# mkdir /nfs/hermes
</pre>


Ready to mount? From zeus type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
zeus# /sbin/mount -t nfs hermes:/home /nfs/hermes
</pre>


All the files on hermes in directory /home are now accessible from
zeus. Type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
zeus:~&gt; ls /nfs/hermes/hermname
</pre>


and you will see the listing of all your files on hermes (if your
account has &ldquo;hermname&rdquo; as user name). Once you are finished and
wish to shutdown the notebook computer, unmount hermes' file system
by giving:
<pre     class="programlisting">
zeus# /sbin/umount /nfs/hermes
</pre>


then close the connection using the script, plip-off.sh.
</p><p>I can even make things a bit more comfortable by adding the
following line in the file /etc/fstab on zeus:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
hermes:/home  /nfs/hermes  nfs  noauto   0  0
</pre><p>This command tells Linux to add to its list of file systems
the directory /home on host hermes, which has to be mounted under
/nfs/hermes on zeus, but not automatically (in particular, not at
boot time), and that hermes has the type <b  >nfs</b>.
(See the man pages nfs(5), filesystems(9), fstab(4) for details.)
By adding that line, the mount command is reduced to:
<pre     class="programlisting">
zeus# /sbin/mount /nfs/hermes
</pre>


Finally, if you are using PLIP solely to use NFS, you could add the
<span   class="bold"><b>mount</b></span> command at the end of the
zeus script plip-on.sh and <span   class="bold"><b>umount</b></span>
at the beginning of plip-off.sh. In this case, you must start PLIP
first on hermes and shut it down first on zeus, otherwise mount
cannot reach the network.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf7580.0x12ea878"></a>If UIDs Don't Match</h2></div></div><p>If you have two different UIDs on hermes and zeus, you can
still read files on zeus from hermes in directory
/nfs/hermes/hermname provided the files are world readable. Thus,
you can list and copy files, but you won't be able to modify them,
even if the directory was exported with read and write access. This
is true because zeusname and hermname are considered to be two
distinct users. Linux identifies users by using their UID, not
their account names.</p><p>If all you want is to copy files from hermes to zeus and it
does not bother you that files are world (or group) readable on
hermes, you can leave things the way they are. More likely you will
wish to write files on hermes' disk as well as read them. You must
choose the same UID for zeusname on zeus and hermname on hermes,
and it must be <span   class="emphasis"><em>distinct</em></span> from any other UID
that might already exist on both systems. It is also better to have
the same identification number for the group, GID, but this is
probably the case already; using Slackware, the default group for
users is just &ldquo;users&rdquo; with GID equal to 100.</p><p>The UID is stored in the /etc/passwd file. On each line of
this file is the information for a particular user beginning with
the user name. The UID is the third field from the beginning of the
line, fields being separated by colons (:). Once you have
determined a UID that suits you, edit the /etc/passwd file and
insert the proper UID. Assuming the UID 410 on zeus can be used on
hermes as well and the GID is 100, there is nothing to change on
zeus. Then change ownership of the files in your home directory on
hermes by giving the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
hermes# chown -R 410.100 hermname .
</pre><p>Make sure you issue the command from your home directory or
else expect to face some problems. Have a look at the man page of
<span   class="bold"><b>chown</b></span> to make sure you understand
how it works. In the case where you have to change the UIDs on both
zeus and hermes, issue the same command from your home directory on
zeus.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Note:</b></span> Make sure that
changing ownership won't affect file access for other users. This
could cause trouble if you had files or directories that you own
but which you share with other users in the same group.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf7580.0x12eac40"></a>IP Masquerading</h2></div></div><p>I now have two computers, connected using a local network
with PLIP, file sharing with NFS. Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?
Yes, but we want more.</p><p>If we have Internet access from zeus via a PPP connection (or
an Ethernet card), we can use zeus as a gateway for hermes to have
Internet access. In other words, we can use the PPP connection on
zeus from hermes through the parallel cable. We will do this using
IP masquerading. This is the subject of a stand-alone article (see
&ldquo;IP Masquerading with Linux&rdquo; by Chris Kostick <i  >Linux Journal</i> July 1996), so I am just going to give pointers
to some relevant documentation. See Resources for the web address
of the IP Masquerade HOWTO and the Firewall-HOWTO. You will have to
recompile the kernel to activate masquerading. Create a
/usr/sbin/ipmasq-on.sh script on zeus containing the lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
ipfwadm -F -p deny
ipfwadm -F -a m -S 192.168.93.0/24 -D 0.0.0.0/0
</pre><p>Invoke the script as root on zeus when the PLIP connection is
active. I know this is not enough information, but masquerading is
not the subject of this article and the HOWTO contains all the
details.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf7580.0x12eaea8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>I said in the beginning of the article that I just wanted a
temporary connection between zeus and hermes; it looks like I got a
little carried away and am close to making it permanent. By the
way, I wrote most of this article on hermes, with the file residing
on a zeus file system mounted via NFS. Yes, I think it is truly
becoming permanent.</p><p><a href="2573s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
