    This article gives us a basic introduction to device files
    and their uses.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf21580.0x10192f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>In designing any operating system, one
question that has to be answered is, &ldquo;How do programs talk to
physical devices?&rdquo; The UNIX answer is for the system to provide
device files. When a program accesses them, they act almost exactly
like ordinary files, but the kernel passes the accesses to those
special files to device drivers. These files are traditionally
found in the /dev directory.
</p><p>To understand device files, you should start by looking at
the contents of the /dev directory:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ls -l /dev
</pre><p>You'll see that these special files have a few differences
from normal files. First, the first character of the permissions is
either &ldquo;b&rdquo; or &ldquo;c&rdquo;, indicating that the device is either a block
or character device. Second, instead of a file size, there are two
numbers. These are the major and minor device numbers. When you
access one of these files, the operating system looks up the major
device number in either the block or character driver table to find
the device driver (possibly with the help of
<span   class="bold"><b>kerneld</b></span>, in the case of modules).
The minor number is used by the device driver for such things as
multiple instances of the same device or different aspects of the
device.
</p><p>You may also note a few files whose first permission
character is &ldquo;s&rdquo;, indicating that they are sockets. Unlike
devices, which are handled by the kernel, these are created by
daemons when the system boots. For example, /dev/printer is a
socket controlled by the <span   class="bold"><b>lpd</b></span>
daemon. If you kill the lpd process, /dev/printer will
vanish.</p><p>If you have the Linux kernel source installed, you can find
out what a device is used for by looking up its device type and
number in the file /usr/src/linux/Documentation/devices.txt. With
most Linux distributions, you'll find that device files exist for a
number of strange operations that you wouldn't expect to use.
However, you should be very careful about deleting any devices;
removing the wrong files can result in making it impossible to use
your system until you restore the file, after rebooting from a
floppy. So make sure you have a boot floppy to rescue your system
in case you make a mistake. Of course, you can't do much to mess up
the /dev directory unless you are running as root.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf21580.0x1019660"></a>Creating Devices</h2></div></div><p>There are two ways to create device files. The recommended
way is to use a program called
<span   class="bold"><b>MAKEDEV</b></span>. You can also create them
manually using the <span   class="bold"><b>mknod</b></span> program.
We will consider them here in reverse order.</p><p>To use mknod, you need to know the name of the device, the
type (character or block), and the major and minor device numbers.
As an example, I once erased /dev/zero. After rebooting from a
floppy and mounting my normal file system on /mnt, I wanted to
create /mnt/dev/zero. I knew that /dev/zero is supposed to be a
character device, with the major number 1 and the minor number 5.
The command I used to create the device was:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mknod /mnt/dev/zero c 5 1
</pre><p>I then had to use <span   class="bold"><b>chmod</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>chown</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>chgrp</b></span> to set the access
permissions and ownership, just as with a regular file. You'll
probably want to read the man page for mknod before using it.
</p><p>If that sounded like a pain, you're right. Fortunately,
there's a better way. Instead of calling mknod directly, you can
use a script called MAKEDEV that already knows the device types,
numbers, permissions and ownership for all the standard devices.
MAKEDEV uses mknod to create the devices but saves you the work of
figuring out the details. For example, typing <b  >MAKEDEV
generic</b> will create most, if not all, of the devices you
would want for a typical system. It is a good idea to read the man
page for MAKEDEV before using it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf21580.0x1019ad8"></a>Specific Devices</h2></div></div><p>/dev/null is the proverbial bit bucket. Shell scripts often
redirect the output of commands to /dev/null to avoid cluttering
the display with unwanted output. When used for input, it acts as
an empty file.</p><p>/dev/random and /dev/urandom access the kernel's random
number generator. The kernel keeps track of various &ldquo;random&rdquo;
events, such as disk and keyboard activity, and uses a
cryptographic hash to generate highly random numbers. It also keeps
track of an estimate of how much random information it has. If you
use /dev/random, it will only give you as much information as it
has available. If you use /dev/urandom, it will give you an
unlimited amount of random information, but without as strong a
guarantee on its unpredictability. Although the kernel uses this
feature internally, very few programs access it through the device
files.</p><p>/dev/zero generates an infinite stream of zeros. It is used
every time you start up an ELF process that uses shared libraries,
making it one of the most important files in /dev.</p><p>IDE hard drives and CD-ROM drives are accessed through
/dev/hd*. Most newer PC motherboards include two IDE interfaces,
each capable of controlling a master and a slave. hda and hdb are
the master and slave drives on the first interface, and hdc and hdd
are the master and slave on the second interface. The number at the
end of the device name refers to the partition number, with 1
through 4 being the primary partitions and 5 and up being extended
partitions.</p><p>Those familiar with other versions of UNIX will be surprised
to find that all the IDE devices are block devices. Traditionally,
there would also be character devices for the drives, and you would
have to be careful which one you used for a given program. (For
example, <span   class="bold"><b>fsck</b></span> wants to use the
character device, but you mount the block device&mdash;not a good idea.)
Linux allows programs to access a block device as if it were a
character device, so there is no need for character devices for
hard drives.</p><p>SCSI devices are a bit more complicated than IDE. If you have
a SCSI card with multiple devices, you probably already know that
each device has a SCSI ID number between 0 and 7. When the SCSI
card is initialized, the operating system asks it which devices are
attached. These devices are separated into several categories. The
first hard drive found (the one with the lowest ID number) is sda,
the first CD-ROM drive is sr0, the first tape drive is sta, and the
first generic device (usually a scanner) is sga. So when accessing
SCSI devices under Linux, you don't need to know the device ID
number (unlike other versions of UNIX). As with IDE drives, there
are no character devices for the drives, and partition numbers are
appended to the drive device file.</p><p>Tape drives typically have at least two different device
files. The primary device automatically rewinds the tape when
you've finished reading or writing to it. The device with an &ldquo;n&rdquo;
prepended to its name doesn't rewind the tape for you. Typically
you would use this to write more than one archive on a tape.</p><p>tty devices are among the most numerous and the most
confusing of all the files in /dev. Every time you log in or launch
a new xterm, a tty device is assigned to the shell. This device is
responsible for displaying the shell's output and providing its
input. It is known as the <span   class="emphasis"><em>controlling tty</em></span> for
that shell and its child processes. The device /dev/tty is a magic
device that refers to whichever tty device is the controlling tty
for that process.</p><p>Besides /dev/tty, there are three types of tty devices:
consoles, serial ports and pseudo devices.</p><p>Console ttys are used when the keyboard and monitor are
directly connected to the system without running the X Window
System. Since you can have several virtual consoles, the devices
are tty0 through tty63. In theory you can have 64 virtual consoles,
but most people use only a few. The device /dev/console is
identical to tty0 and is needed for historical reasons. If your
system lets you log in on consoles 1 through 6, then when you run X
Windows System, X uses console 7, so you'll need /dev/tty1 through
/dev/tty7 on your system. I recommend having files up through
/dev/tty12. For more information on using virtual consoles, see the
article <span   class="emphasis"><em>Keyboards, Consoles and VT Cruising</em></span> by
John Fisk in the November 1996 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>If you have a terminal connected to a serial port or if you
dial in using a modem, you'll use a serial tty device. There are a
number of different serial devices which are used if you have a
special card with many serial ports (ttyC*, ttyD*, ttyX* and
ttyR*), but most people just use ttyS* for the normal serial ports
(COM1 through COM4 under DOS).</p><p>This begins to get confusing, because there are also
<span   class="emphasis"><em>callout</em></span> devices for each serial port. For each
ttyS device there is a corresponding cua device. If you're only
using the serial port for one purpose, it probably doesn't matter
which device you use. To be able to both dial in to your machine
remotely and dial out when you're home, be sure to use the tty
version of the device to listen for incoming calls and the callout
version to place outgoing calls. By doing this, you won't mess up
someone who has dialed in by trying to dial out on the same line.
(See &ldquo;Serial Port Devices&rdquo;.)</p><p>Pseudo tty devices are used when a login is initiated by
launching a new xterm or by connecting to your machine via TELNET.
Because you can have lots of windows open and many TELNET sessions
going on at one time, you may need a lot of these devices. Hence,
you should have a lot of files of the form /dev/pty*. Originally,
Linux limited you to 64 pseudo terminals, but some people found
that too restrictive, so you can now have up to 256 of them, using
different major and minor device numbers. Making it a bit more
complicated, there are actually two devices for each pseudo tty: a
master and a slave. Thus, for each /dev/pty* file, there's a
matching /dev/tty* file. Fortunately, you don't have to worry about
the distinction other than being careful to create or delete them
in pairs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf21580.0x101a1b8"></a>Optimizing /dev</h2></div></div><p>If you wish to get every possible millisecond out of your
system, there are a few things you should know about directories in
UNIX file systems. (Though technically I'm talking about the
implementation of the EXT2 file system, the points apply to almost
all UNIX file systems.)</p><p>First note that though the command
<span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> always displays the directory
in a sorted order, directories are not stored with their entries
sorted. Instead, each new entry is placed as close to the front of
the directory as possible.</p><p>To find a file in a directory, the file name is compared with
the first file in the directory. If it doesn't match, the second
name is checked, and so on until either a match is found, or the
end of the directory is reached. Consequently, if you have a large
number of files in a directory and are frequently opening the last
file in the directory, your CPU is doing a lot of comparisons. If,
however, you could control the order of the entries, so as to place
the most-frequently-used entries at the beginning of the directory,
this would not be such an issue.</p><p>If you want to redo the internal ordering of the entries in
/dev, boot from a floppy and then mount your primary file system.
If your regular file system is mounted as /mnt, your regular device
directory is /mnt/dev. Create a new directory called /mnt/dev2. Now
you can move device files from /mnt/dev to /mnt/dev2. You will
probably want to start with /mnt/dev/zero and /mnt/dev/null, as
these two are opened far more frequently than any other
devices.</p><p>If that sounds like a hassle, then don't bother with it. You
probably won't notice any difference unless you are running on an
old 386. Furthermore, the new directory cache under development in
the 2.1.x kernel series will most likely make this a
non-issue.</p><p><a href="2597s1.html" target="_self">Serial Port Devices</a></p></div></div>
