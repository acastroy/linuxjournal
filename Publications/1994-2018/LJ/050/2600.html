    Mr. Seiferth offers us a solution for keeping track of
    shared files on over an Intranet that utilizes several
    operating systems.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1158580.0x1250348"></a></h2></div></div><p>Like many of you, I often face challenges
when recommending a UNIX-based solution at work. Despite its track
record, many managers feel UNIX still has something to prove. So
putting a UNIX system in place means working extra fast and
decisively. I had just such an opening recently when I put together
a system to publish the common file sharing areas of our Microsoft
Windows NT-based network. I thought others might be interested in
this system and created a distribution, so you too can have your
own Intranet Filing System.
</p><p>One of Microsoft's Windows NT failings is its archaic file
system. While many of its inadequacies may be overcome, the users
of our internal LAN were having problems finding information among
the millions of files spread across thousands of directories
located on hundreds of servers across the world. We used Linux,
Sun's Solaris and some Netscape products to integrate and publish
these file-sharing areas on our Intranet. You can use this system
to publish any mountable file system to include FTP sites, Novell
and Appleshare File Servers and NFS shares.</p><p>The key to this system working on a network utilizing
Microsoft products is the ability of the Linux kernel (later 2.0
and 2.1 versions) to mount local NTFS and remote SMB volumes.
There's nothing esoteric about enabling or using this option, just
check it off when you're building the kernel. Once you've got an
SMB-capable kernel installed, you're almost ready to go. The other
components are the <span   class="bold"><b>smbfs</b></span>
utilities, the <span   class="bold"><b>wu-ftpd</b></span> FTP server
suite, a web server, a search engine and a javascript-capable
browser. Your distribution has probably installed an operational
FTP and web server, and most people nowadays have the Netscape
browser installed, so all you need to do is compile the smbfs
utilities and set up a search engine.</p><p>If most of the documents on the file areas you wish to
publish are in text or HTML format, there are a number of search
engines from which to choose:
<span   class="bold"><b>htdig</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>glimpse</b></span>, for example. If you want
to be able to search non-HTML documents then you might need one of
the commercial search engines. We use Netscape's Catalog Server for
Solaris, which has the ability to index binary files such as
Adobe's PDF and popular office-automation application
formats.</p><p>Before your &ldquo;enterprise information warehouse&rdquo; becomes
operational, a few configuration files must be modified on your
system. For instance, if you want your system to configure itself
after a reboot, you'll need to modify your startup files. Also,
make sure your computer is automatically mounting SMB shares into
an area <span   class="emphasis"><em>accessible by an anonymous FTP session</em></span>
when you boot your system and enable a few features of your FTP
server.</p><p>First, let's contend with mounting shares automatically. I do
this with a standard run-level 3/5 initscript;
<a href="2600l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> is an excerpt showing
the most critical lines.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>smbmount(8)</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>umount(8)</b></span> man pages have more
details on what all those flags are about. Basically, we are
mounting the shares into a directory accessible via anonymous FTP.
Our common shares are read/write for everyone. If your site is more
cautious you may want to review the implications of the file
permissions and ownership or perhaps impose access controls using
your file system and web server's security mechanisms.</p><p>Now, let's take a look at scripts used to configure your FTP
server. If you start your FTP daemon using the
<b  >-a</b> option, the /etc/ftpaccess file will allow
you to customize many aspects of the FTP server's performance and
capabilities. Normally, you enable the <b  >-a</b> option
of your FTP server in your /etc/inetd.conf file. Some people run
their FTP full time, in this case check the startup files in your
/etc/rc.d/rc3.d or rc5.d directory and add the option there. Among
the benefits of using <span   class="bold"><b>ftpaccess</b></span> is
the ability to specify header and trailer messages for the
directory listings generated by your FTP server.</p><p>A piece of our user interface is composed using an HTML file
in the root directory of the FTP daemon's file area. The entry in
ftpaccess is as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
...
message /welcome.html login
</pre><p>Now the contents of welcome.html are displayed at the
beginning of FTP directory listings. The source of welcome.html is
shown in <a href="2600l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>.
</p><p>The best way to understand what this file does is to just
load it up and go. In a nutshell, if the FTP listing is contained
within a frame then the <b  >if</b> part of the
conditional is presented. The interface allows the user to press an
&ldquo;upload&rdquo; button which will pop open another browser instance with
the FTP directory as the root window. When welcome.html is
displayed as &ldquo;top&rdquo; within this browser; it displays instructions
on how to upload a file using the FTP capabilities of the
browser.</p><p>This interface is not the first one we tried. We needed a
design that allowed easy navigation around a complicated system and
kept at least minimal help hints in front of the users all the
time. I wanted to make the system intuitive, so we could spend less
time answering questions and more time working on new ideas. The
tests we conducted showed most people knew how to download files
but were surprised to learn they could upload or view the contents
of files. We tried HTTP uploads and downloads but settled on the
combination of FTP and HTTP servers distributed across several
machines. Encapsulating the FTP file display simplified uploads and
downloads. Unlike a web server, our FTP server labels all files as
a single MIME type allowing us to use a single helper application
to easily display all files. Getting the preview function to work
will require the association of MIME type(s) with applications on
the user's computer. We use a universal viewer. You might
investigate one of the many plug-ins which allow viewing files
within the browser.</p><p>Now the majority of the work and trickery is done; all that
remains is the remainder of the frame-based user interface, a few
snazzy graphics and some help files. When you download the
distribution, you may notice that within our frame definition
document we are distributing this system across several machines.
This is an important feature of the system. We make use of local
proxy servers for FTP and HTTP traffic to keep down the loading of
our MAN/WAN backbone. We place a proxy and web server on the
department's subdomain. Since the proxy and web are local to users,
we've found that lots of times the files retrieved from the central
Linux-based FTP server (those ultimately stored on our SMB common
file area) are served from the local proxy (cache) speeding up the
file transfer dramatically and reducing our network traffic.</p><p>I mentioned before that we are using the SPARC Solaris
version of the Netscape Catalog Server to allow users to
expediently find any document or content within a wide variety of
popular UNIX (in particular, Linux), Macintosh and Microsoft
Windows application formats. We inserted a custom interface to this
server which places the results into the frame normally utilized by
the FTP directory display or opening splash screen. This feature
provides some much needed help to users who must retrieve one of
several hundred thousand documents stored on servers spread across
the globe. Locating documents is absolutely not feasible using the
Microsoft Windows NT file manager search feature previously
recommended by the Microsoft Windows NT operators.</p><p>You can add many other enhancements such as browser access to
multiple file system types (NFS, Appleshare, SMB, AFS, etc.) and
Internet/Intranet FTP areas. We are also working on a configuration
management add-on using PHP/FI and Postgres to present users with a
fully graphical file upload facility which will also store meta
data on documents such as the originator of the information, the
originator's e-mail address and other information.</p><p><a href="2600s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="2600s2.html" target="_self">Credits</a></p></div></div>
