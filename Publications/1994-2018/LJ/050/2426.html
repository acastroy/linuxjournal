    Caldera continues to offer a commercial grade, shrink-wrap
    package
    with more of the applications to make it a complete solution for
    business.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2426f1.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfe2580.0x10da3f8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Manufacturer: Caldera</p></li><li><p>E-mail: orders@caldera.com</p></li><li><p>URL: http://www.caldera.com/</p></li><li><p>Price: $59 US (Base) $199 US (Standard)</p></li><li><p>Reviewer: Sid Wentworth</p></li></ul></div><p>Caldera's latest offerings are OpenLinux Base and Standard,
version 1.2. Both are based on the Linux 2.0.33 kernel which, at
the time of this writing (March), puts them a jump ahead of the
other commercial Linux distributions.</p><p>However, a new kernel is not what makes this distribution
stand out from the others. Caldera continues to offer a commercial
grade, shrink-wrap package with more of the applications to make it
a complete solution for business. I don't have the numbers, but I
would expect that the majority of Caldera products are sold through
VARs (value-added resellers) who offer complete solutions to their
customers.</p><p>Specifically, applications found in COL, in addition to the
programs generally found in all the distributions, are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The Netscape FastTrack secure web server</p></li><li><p>The Looking Glass Desktop</p></li><li><p>Netscape Communicator 4.0 and Navigator 3.0 web
browsers</p></li><li><p>StarOffice 4.0</p></li><li><p>Adabas D personal edition SQL database</p></li><li><p>BRU 2000 backup/restore utility</p></li></ul></div><p>COL Standard includes commercial versions of these software
packages. COL Base is missing the Netscape web server and BRU, and
it includes only the personal-use versions of StarOffice and
Adabas. Frankly, I consider the missing pieces to be worth the
price of the standard distribution.</p><p>By the way, Caldera is the company that established the
relationships to make the ports of Netscape, StarOffice, Adabas and
WordPerfect to Linux happen.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfe2580.0x10daea0"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Caldera has their own install/systems administration tool
called LISA. I find it to be very much like S.u.S.E.'s YAST. I
consider this interesting as both were written in Germany&mdash;it must
be an indication of German engineering.</p><p>LISA is easy to use with dialog boxes to guide you through
the installation. The installation instructions come in English,
German, French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese. LISA offers you a
choice of a few standard installations (small disk,
reasonable-sized disk, large disk and go for it), plus, for the
expert who wants to do everything himself, an option to fine tune
the packages being installed.</p><p>I did the install on an AMD K6 system with a huge disk. I
first selected the &ldquo;go for it&rdquo; install option and ran into some
glitches&mdash;nothing serious, just messages like &ldquo;couldn't find
unknown.rpm&rdquo;. For round two I selected the default installation
and everything ran flawlessly. Hopefully, by the time you read
this, the kinks will be worked out of the everything
install.</p><p>The only other problem I encountered during installation was
an error in configuring the Korn shell. The location where the
installation program expected to find it (/usr/bin/pdksh) was not
where it actually was. A quick edit of the /etc/passwd file and all
was well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfe2580.0x10db0b0"></a>The User Environment</h2></div></div><p>Caldera, by default, uses the Looking Glass Desktop. Not
being a desktop sort of guy, I am not particularly excited about
it, but, if you want a desktop, it seems adequate. My biggest
complaint is that this desktop is non-standard; however, this is
similar to my complaint about Red Hat's use of a totally
non-standard X Window System manager setup called &ldquo;The Next
Level&rdquo;. Just give me an xterm and I am happy.</p><p>The biggest hit for me was StarOffice. As I said, this
product alone is worth the cost of COL standard. If offers a word
processor, presentation software, graphics software, spreadsheet
and HTML editor all in one integrated package. My biggest objection
to StarOffice is that it looks like a Windows 95 application, but I
expect this was a conscious design decision and probably the right
one for most potential users. I understand <i  >Linux Journal</i> will be doing a review of this product in the
near future.</p><p>I didn't get a chance to play with the Netscape FastTrack
Server but this is a commercial, secure web server so I expect it
will be very useful to anyone intending to set up a serious web
site. A separate, 130-page manual is included in the package that
covers administration of this server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfe2580.0x10db2c0"></a>The Package</h2></div></div><p>Caldera OpenLinux comes in a very nice package of serious
store shelf display quality. Inside the front cover of the box is
all the appropriate marketing stuff with quotes from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Unix
Review</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Software Development</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>InfoWorld</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Computer
Shopper</em></span> and <i  >Linux Journal</i> about the
product. Current Linux users don't need this hype, but it certainly
helps on the retail shelf.</p><p>There is a bootable CD-ROM with the base distribution on it
and a boot and modules floppy for systems that can't boot off of
CD-ROM. There is also a second CD-ROM labeled &ldquo;Extra&rdquo; which
includes StarOffice 4.0 and some programs contributed by outside
sources. A third CD-ROM contains Adabas. There are also cards for
obtaining a discount on Accelerated X servers, PartitionMagic and a
free issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>The manuals include a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started
Guide</em></span>, an addendum to that guide and the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>FastTrack Server Administrator's Guide</em></span>. The
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started Guide</em></span> does a good job of
hand-holding for the installation process. Most of this is
unnecessary if you have installed any Linux flavor before, but it
is there if you need it. What is important is the information on
using the Looking Glass Desktop.</p><p>The addendum is a release summary for version 1.2 and some
additional information not covered in the manual itself. My biggest
nit is that StarOffice 4.0 is mentioned on page 7 of this manual in
the form of a description, but there are no installation
instructions for it. Installation isn't hard, but it would have
been nice to cover it in the documentation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfe2580.0x10db7e8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>COL Base and Standard are real products with a lot of retail
appeal. They aren't perfect, which disappoints me&mdash;the problems I
found could have been avoided by a little more testing before
burning the CD-ROMs&mdash;but the competition (including Microsoft
software) isn't perfect either. The included applications are
powerful and show that Linux on an office desktop is truly
possible.</p><p>For the average geek, Caldera's products are not much
different from Red Hat or S.u.S.E. For serious office applications
or convincing your significant other to use Linux, I feel OpenLinux
has a lot of potential.</p></div></div>
