    The story of a company replacing Windows systems with Linux
    to obtain better speed and greater reliability.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b08580.0x1c003f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Linux is the best tool I have found for
facilitating the expansion of Internet and Intranet systems
throughout the company, Stocks &amp; Stocks I.T., that employs me.
</p><p>Upon arriving in South Africa from Australia, my first task
was to develop and implement a system which would allow general
Internet users to obtain accurate, real-time hotel room
availability details from the company's chain of hotels and game
resorts. This is a list of what I had to work with:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>WAN spanning South Africa</p></li><li><p>System protected by firewall</p></li><li><p>TCP/IP as the primary protocol</p></li><li><p>Motorola routers</p></li></ul></div><p>The immediate problems to deal with were:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Each hotel/resort used Novell Netware 3.12 running
only IPX/SPX.</p></li><li><p>Each hotel/resort room database was approximately
300KB in size.</p></li><li><p>Each hotel/resort was linked using a 64KB line (at
best).</p></li><li><p>Everyone was running around with Windows in their
mind.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b08580.0x1c00be0"></a>Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>The first prototype system I set up was a central Linux web
server as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Pentium 133 64MB RAM, S3-Trio 64 with 4MB RAM, ADI
17-inch monitor (Microscan), 1.2GB EIDE HDD, 8x CD-ROM, 3Com 3C509b
NIC (network interface card), Ergo keyboard/mouse
(Microsoft)</p></li><li><p>Linux Slackware 1.2.13, NSCA HTTPd v1.10</p></li></ul></div><p>The reason for having 64MB RAM, a 17-inch monitor and other
&ldquo;niceties&rdquo; was so this system could also be used for web
development of any home pages/Intranet pages.</p><p>At each of the hotels the only system available to me was
Windows 95 on which I used a scheduling system to send the room
database to the central web server every morning at about 6AM. The
Windows 95 machines were also being used to act as a bridge between
Novell and TCP/IP. This gave the Internet user statistics on room
availability that could be up to 24 hours old. The room databases
were in DBase-IV format, for which I wrote a C application to
search and return statistics given desired room and date
details.</p><p>The system seemed fine for a while, until the Windows 95
machines mysteriously started to shut down, lock up, etc. for no
apparent reason. It was also about this time that the &ldquo;higher
management&rdquo; decided that the ability to obtain &ldquo;real-time&rdquo; room
availability statistics was a priority.</p><p>I felt real-time statistics would be an impossibility with
the current setup, as it meant sending 300KB of data to the central
Linux server over a 64KB line in less time than it takes for the
average person to get bored and move on to another web page.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b08580.0x1c01000"></a>Current Prototype</h2></div></div><p>For the current prototype, the whole process was turned
upside down. While still retaining the central web server, I
replaced the Windows 95 machines with small, highly effective Linux
machines (2.0.29). These Linux machines now process availability
requests locally via a secure shell from the central web
server.</p><p>In order to provide a backup, I left the existing Windows 95
system on each machine and used FIPS (First Interactive
Partitioning System) to create a new partition on which I installed
Linux. Details of the &ldquo;remote&rdquo; machines are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Pentium 100 (Generic Clone), 8MB RAM, 800MB HDD,
3Com 3C509b NIC (no monitor, no keyboard, no mouse)</p></li><li><p>Linux 2.0.29 (Slackware), Secure Shell
(<span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span>),
<span   class="bold"><b>ncpfs</b></span> (network file system that
supports the NCP protocol used by Novell)</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>ncpfs</b></span> is used to mount a
Novell Netware volume containing the room availability database to
a local directory at boot time. It should be stressed that without
ncpfs, there is no way this project would have gotten into the
&ldquo;real-time&rdquo; phase successfully.</p><p>The process of checking room availability for hotels is now
as follows (Local = central web server, Remote = Linux system at
required hotel):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Local: Get room/date details (HTML POST
form).</p></li><li><p>Local: CGI application processes POST data and
executes.</p></li><li><p>Local: Use ssh to log in to the appropriate remote
Linux machine.</p></li><li><p>Remote: Search database located on Novell Netware
server.</p></li><li><p>Remote: Exit search with 0 = Success, 1 =
Failure.</p></li><li><p>Local: ssh returns the result of the search through
its exit value.</p></li><li><p>Local: CGI application generates an HTML file with
the correct response, depending on the database search
result.</p></li></ul></div><p>This whole process has been timed to take less than 10
seconds which I believe is an acceptable figure (given that there
is a great deal of existing traffic on the lines). Something worth
noting is that using ssh in order to remotely execute processes
greatly improved operations. <span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span>
offers public key encryption for all transactions and is
effectively easier to setup than
<span   class="bold"><b>rsh</b></span>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b08580.0x1c01b00"></a>Improving the Intranet</h2></div></div><p>Now that the Hotel reservation system was up and running in a
manner that pleased management, it was time to start working on the
Intranet. Our primary objectives were:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Gains in productivity</p></li><li><p>Ease of use</p></li><li><p>Improvements in speed</p></li></ul></div><p>The applications the Intranet could be used to accomplish
were:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Phone/e-mail book</p></li><li><p>Comments/Suggestions/Gripes list</p></li><li><p>Billboard</p></li><li><p>Training course enrollment</p></li><li><p>Stationery/Computer shop</p></li></ul></div><p>All the applications were written in ANSI-C. No actual HTML
files exist for these applications, as the HTML is created
dynamically through the application. Although this increases the
time required to update the pages (having to edit, compile, etc.),
it's a small tradeoff compared to the resultant simplicity. As a
minor alternative I have enabled some applications to read an
external file, parse it (for any replaceable tokens) and redirect
it to stdout. This too produces more overhead, but offers easier
HTML page maintenance.</p><p>In order to provide database functions and non-trivial HTML
POST/GET form handling, two ANSI-C object/libraries were created.
All the libraries were written in ANSI C and compiled with
<span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b08580.0x1bf8c28"></a>Apache and Java</h2></div></div><p>After a couple of weeks, it was time to upgrade the web
server to Apache 1.2b10 giving better speed and security. The
upgrade to Apache from NSCA was relatively painless, with a few
alterations made to the /conf/*.conf files to reflect my new
directory structure.</p><p>Java was the next item on the list of &ldquo;things to think
about&rdquo;. To me, Java is a great idea offering what C has almost
been offering for a long time. However, the thought of going back
from thin client into &ldquo;medium-thin&rdquo; was not something that
interested me much. Linux is a reliable, powerful OS. I have full
confidence in its ability to handle the load of the CGI
applications we run. The reduction in administration by sticking
with thin-client applications far outweighs the increase in server
load from having to process every application transaction&mdash;this is
why we chose Java.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b08580.0x1bf8d88"></a>Next Projects</h2></div></div><p>Next, there was the need for an FTP-type file warehouse.
Since most of the clients that are running within the Intranet are
Windows-based, few are keen on using FTP. Samba was installed in
order to alleviate this &ldquo;barrier&rdquo;. Samba enabled all Windows 3.1,
95, NT and OS/2 users to gain access to their files, applications,
drivers and utilities. Of course, anonymous FTP was still set up,
just in case I wasn't the only one of my kind in this
company.</p><p>My most potent Linux machine is now being used to churn out
images and animations using POV-Ray 3.0 which have markedly
improved the appearance of the Intranet pages. I am currently
working on a small (15-second) animation to be used as an
&ldquo;introduction&rdquo; to Stocks &amp; Stocks. To date, these are the
Linux installation statistics for the company:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Seven machines doing hotel remote access
support/availability response</p></li><li><p>Two for web application and graphic
development</p></li><li><p>Three servers</p></li></ul></div><p>While a total of twelve machines may not seem like many for a
company the size of Stocks, one must consider that there are only
five NT boxes and one AS/400. (Okay, one AS/400 is often
enough.)</p><p>The failure rate of the Linux systems has effectively been
0%. To date there has been only one failure, caused only by a power
supply getting friendly with a bolt of lightning. Once I've
installed a Linux machine, providing the user (me) doesn't do
anything malicious (such as remove
<span   class="bold"><b>agetty</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>getty</b></span>--another story), there's
little cause to worry.</p><p>Some may feel Linux (and any UNIX system for that matter) has
a somewhat less &ldquo;user-friendly&rdquo; interface when compared to
Windows. However, Linux was chosen by Stocks &amp; Stocks because
it offers one thing that Windows does not&mdash;dependability. For me,
Linux is &ldquo;admin-friendly&rdquo;.</p></div></div>
