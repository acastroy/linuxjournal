    An article giving us all the information about a new tool for
    performance monitoring of distributed systems.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12a4580.0x139cd40"></a></h2></div></div><p>Quite a long title for such a small
software package, but it describes exactly the content of this
article. In our networked world, the amount of information is
growing and becoming less manageable. The first idea for developing
a performance tool came from the CERT engineer (Gygi), who works
for one of Europe's academic networks&mdash;SWITCH, Swiss Academic and
Research Network. SWITCH's head office is located in Zurich. Less
than two dozen highly qualified engineers operate some 50 sites
throughout Switzerland as well as the central SWITCH system at ETH
Zurich computing center.
</p><p>While SWITCH is already using some performance monitoring
tools, the procedures are far from satisfactory. Each time the
engineers want to monitor a remote system, they have to log in and
use common tools such as <span   class="bold"><b>top</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>ps</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>df</b></span>, etc. This introduces
undesirable security risks.</p><p>What SWITCH needed was a simple, reliable, secure tool that
could be easily used from any authorized place in the network (or
Internet). The tool should be compact&mdash;it must not use much of the
system's resources. Furthermore, it should be multi-platform
oriented. Even though SWITCH maintains mostly Sun workstations, the
number of Linux boxes and other UNIX systems that they monitor is
not negligible. As a first step we were interested in monitoring
basic system resources: CPU/memory/swap usage and some specific
processes (daemons such as <span   class="bold"><b>inetd</b></span>).
These resources provide a snapshot of a monitored system. In the
second phase we decided to observe some additional parameters such
as network traffic, disk usage, user/ftp connections and some other
processes.</p><p><a href="2419f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Three-Tier Architecture of MTool</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12a4580.0x139d160"></a>Three-Tier Architecture and Java</h2></div></div><p>The demands for a multi-platform, secure tool brought us to a
simple decision&mdash;Java. As we have a strong students' Java team at
our lab, Java was chosen as the basic development tool. Java is a
network-oriented, robust tool and provides enough security for our
requirements. We won't go into details of the language, but it was
also clear that Java was not appropriate for the system-level
programming needed to access system resources. For that reason, we
chose a three-tier architecture (see Figure 1). This architecture
represents a response to some of the drawbacks of the standard
two-tier client/server network architecture. Client/server
applications are quite easy to program; the problem is how to
manage client-side software. The problem is even bigger when we
require a multi-platform environment. Three-tier architecture
introduces so-called middleware (e.g., the Java server in Figure
1). Basically, the middle software residing on the server
represents a bridge between a client and a server. The middle tier
is not only capable of handling more client connections, but also
provides a more secure method of communication. Since the
middleware and the client part can be written in Java, we come to a
very important issue&mdash;platform independence.</p><p>Clients are no longer expected to use platform-dependent
code. Even more, a copy of a Java-enabled network browser such as
Netscape would suffice. Developers can now take a break, since they
don't have to write a lot of platform-dependent versions of their
software. This basic idea is also used on network computers (NC).
Whenever the developers change the client's code, a new version can
be made available for distribution on the middle-tier server. Then
next time the client runs the program, the new version is
automatically downloaded. The platform-dependent software which
provides information to the clients over the middleware is written
in ANSI C. The communication between middleware and the server is
done using sockets.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12a4580.0x139d2c0"></a>Linux</h2></div></div><p>As we have already mentioned, we had a daemon
(<span   class="bold"><b>mtoold</b></span>) written for Sun
workstations since they represent a majority in Switzerland's
academic network. However, our environment is mainly equipped with
HP workstations; we also have more than 70 Linux boxes around the
classrooms and labs, as well as Windows 95/NT computers. We've
learned a lot from Linux since 1993, when we built our first Linux
box using the 0.99pl15 kernel. Linux has made tremendous progress
since that time.</p><p>Thus, for us, Linux as a development &ldquo;playground&rdquo; was a
logical choice. Linux has a well documented /proc file system. (See
&ldquo;The /proc File System and ProcMeter&rdquo; by Andrew M. Johnson,
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, April 1997.) Linux is the best
documented operating system available. What we missed most was a
good Java development tool. If Linux had a GUI like Symantec's
Visual Cafe, we would have been very happy indeed. At that time, we
were still forced to use the command-line Java compilers and
interpreters that come with the standard Java Development Kit (JDK
1.0.2 or JDK 1.1.1). So, we used Visual Cafe under Windows for
creation of the user interface, then manually added some specific
code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12a4580.0x139d4d0"></a>Architecture of MTool</h2></div></div><p>Three-tier architecture turned out to be a good solution. We
defined three different levels:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Client software</p></li><li><p>Item middleware</p></li><li><p>Platform dependent daemons</p></li></ol></div><p>To monitor specific systems you must be connected to the
network; actually, you have to connect to the middle-tier Java
server. Client side presents just a GUI (Graphical User Interface).
Since it is written in Java, a Java capable browser is all you
need. After you make a connection to the Java server, the GUI code
is transferred to your local machine. Code is then interpreted with
the Java built-in interpreter (if you use Netscape, for
example).</p><p>The central point of our system is the middle-tier Java
server. It not only holds Java classes to be transferred to the
local clients, but it also takes care of the monitoring. The Java
server is a program that runs all the time but demands only a few
system resources. It connects to monitored computers and asks them
for new data. Communication is handled via sockets and is very
simple. We also introduced a very simple protocol for data
transfer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12a4580.0x139d8f0"></a>Client Software</h2></div></div><p>On the client side, one must run a starting applet to bring
up the basic window in which all the computers to be monitored are
listed (see Figure 2). Once we choose a computer's name from the
list, a second window appears containing all the information about
the observed system. We used a tabbed panel to display different
types of data. We've chosen a tabbed panel to ease the upgrade
procedure. If we add new system information, there is no problem
with the graphical interface&mdash;we simply add a new panel.</p><p><a href="2419f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2. Main
MTool Window</b></span></a></p><p>At this time we can provide the following system
resources:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>CPU information (user, nice, idle, sys,
average)</p></li><li><p>Disk and memory information (free, used,
swap)</p></li><li><p>Network traffic</p></li><li><p>Processes</p></li><li><p>User connections</p></li></ul></div><p><a href="2419f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3. CPU

computer, but it can also run on a client of one of the monitored
computers. The communication with the monitored computers via
sockets is quite short and lasts only as long as the data transfer.
At any time we can choose how often the Java server requests system
resource data. At that time, a &ldquo;ping&rdquo; is sent to all monitored
computers. At the ping, <span   class="bold"><b>mtoold</b></span> is
awakened by <span   class="bold"><b>inetd</b></span>. Then mtoold
reads system resource information and forwards that information to
the middle-tier Java server. After completion the mtoold daemon
&ldquo;sleeps&rdquo; until the next server's ping. The platform-dependent
mtoold therefore uses system resources for only a very short
time.</p><p>For its operation, the Java server is supported by one
configuration file, named <b  >MTool.conf</b>. The first
part of this file contains the list of computers to be monitored,
then the time between monitoring intervals, and last the list of
client computers authorized to communicate with the Java server and
thus monitor selected computer systems. We can use IP addresses or
IP host names or both. As you can see from the sample configuration
file below, one can also use the asterisk wild card in defining the
domain name or the subnetwork address.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

platform-dependent. With Linux we use the <b  >/proc</b>
file system for CPU, memory and network information. Sun and HP do
not provide such an elegant approach; on these platforms we have to
use <b  >/dev/kmem</b> files.</p><p>We have defined a protocol for socket communication.
Information is transferred as an ASCII stream concatenated from
reserved words such as <b  >GRAPH</b>,
<b  >VALUE</b>, <b  >disk</b>,
<b  >user</b>, <b  >process</b> etc. and
specific values separated with the character <b  >|</b>
as a delimiter. In this way, we can add a new observed parameter
without difficulty. A sample stream looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
GRAPH|LOAD_avg1|0.06|GRAPH|LOAD_avg2|0.12|GRAPH|
LOAD_avg3|0.22|GRAPH|CPU_user|1.00|GRAPH|CPU_nice|
0.00|GRAPH|CPU_system|0.00|GRAPH|CPU_idle|99.00|
VALUE|MEM_real|14652K|VALUE|MEM_free|252K|VALUE|
MEM_swap|33260K|VALUE|MEM_swap_free|31620K|
</pre><p>At this time, it is possible to intercept data transferred
over the network; therefore, we are preparing Java encryption
classes to enable secure data transfer. We are currently evaluating
the DES and RSA algorithms. RSA would serve for key exchange
(public and private) while DES, which is faster, would serve for
the data transfer.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>mtoold</b></span> uses one simple
configuration file which holds the names of the processes to be
monitored. If this file is empty, information about all processes
currently running on a monitored computer are transferred over the
socket communication line.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12a4580.0x16a9a48"></a>At the End</h2></div></div><p>Actually, at this time, we are not finished. The current
version of MTool is just an intermediate step towards a more
sophisticated and usable tool; however, it still provides a
comfortable way of system monitoring. If we are authorized, we can
monitor selected systems from any place in the world&mdash;a
Java-capable browser is the only necessity. MTool is a small,
powerful tool with many benefits. While using Linux as a
development environment was a good choice, we would still like to
appeal to the (non)commercial software companies to provide more
Java development tools under Linux. Linux and Java together
represent a competitive, reliable and cheap development
system.</p></div></div>
