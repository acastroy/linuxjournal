    This article contains all the information you need to run
    Linux on the PalmPilot personal digital assistant.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2711f1.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15dc580.0x16d45b0"></a></h2></div></div><p> My brother and I share many things, not
the least of which is an interest in electronic gadgets. I tend to
go big&mdash;new computers, new monitors, new expenses. My brother
thinks small&mdash;Personal Digital Assistants, also known as PDAs. He's
collected a few different models over the past couple of years.
Right now I think he's working on a PSION or possibly one of those
Redmond atrocities known as Win/CE PDAs. My brother says of these
that &ldquo;wince&rdquo; is about right.
</p><p>I had mentioned sometime back that I wanted to get a PDA and
thought a U.S. Robotics PalmPilot (now 3Com) would be the one to
get. I had read somewhere that there was Linux software for use
with the Pilot and that meant I could download and upload data
directly to my Linux system. Fortunately, my little brother was
listening that particular day. For Christmas this year he gave me
his old PalmPilot. Okay, it's used&mdash;but it's still a cool
gift.</p><p>The PalmPilot actually comes in four different
configurations. The earlier versions are the Pilot 1000 (the
version I now have) and the Pilot 5000. The newer versions are the
Pilot Personal and the Pilot Professional. The older versions don't
have a backlit display and come with significantly less memory.
They can, however, be upgraded. My brother had upgraded the 1000 to
1MB of memory prior to giving it to me. Besides more memory, the
new models have version 2.0 of the operating system, and the
Professional has a TCP/IP stack and e-mail tools.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15dc580.0x16d4768"></a>Getting Started&mdash;The Linux Side Software</h2></div></div><p>If you're going to use a PalmPilot with Linux, you need to
start with its HOWTO document. The PalmPilot HOWTO is available
from the Linux Documentation Project (LDP) as well as from its
official site. The HOWTO, written by David H. Silber, is quite easy
to follow and offers all the information you need to get started. I
should note that I managed to get the software working using only
the HOWTO&mdash;I didn't need to subscribe to any mailing lists or scan
weeks of newsgroup archives. This is a credit to both the HOWTO
author and the simplicity of the PalmPilot.</p><p>The HOWTO points the reader to the primary software archives
from which you can download a variety of packages. The packages of
interest to the new user are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>pilot-link</b></span>: The
main package of interest, it includes the
<span   class="bold"><b>pilot-xfer</b></span> program for
transferring programs and data to and from the Pilot and Linux
along with a host of other tools. The current revision of this
software is 0.8.9. Note that the HOWTO links directly to the 0.8.2
version. The software archives list this package as
pilot-link.x.y.z.tar.gz, where x.y.z is the version number.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>PilotManager</b></span>:
Graphical interface to the Pilot for UNIX/X systems. Handles most
of the tasks that the pilot-xfer software does from the command
line, but uses an X-based interface. This is a Perl/Tk
application.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>MakeDoc</b></span>: Turns
text files into a document format better suited for the
Pilot.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>prc-tools</b></span>: The
package you need in order to develop software for the Pilot.</p></li></ul></div><p>The first package to retrieve is the pilot-link software,
which contains a collection of about 30 programs. Most of them have
very specific tasks such as uploading or retrieving &ldquo;Memos&rdquo; or
&ldquo;ToDo&rdquo; lists. Of these programs, the most useful is pilot-xfer.
This program is used to back up and restore complete programs and
databases, even the entire Pilot system. It can even do incremental
backups automatically. All of the programs in the pilot-link
package are command-line programs.</p><p>PilotManager is a Perl/Tk graphical interface to the Pilot.
It apparently works with CDE's Calendar applications, but since I
don't run CDE I didn't try this feature out. The list of features
states the PilotManager has four primary features: uploading new
applications and databases, synchronizing the Pilot with the CDE
Calendar application, uploading text files as Pilot Memos, and
backing up the Pilot to your UNIX system.</p><p>MakeDoc is a tool for converting ordinary text files into a
compressed format. This format can be read by Rick Bram's PilotDOC
reader, which is now a shareware product known as AportisDoc
Trialware 2.0. Rick developed this reader because the Pilot's
document handling was limited to relatively small documents.</p><p>Finally, prc-tools are a set of tools for building
applications for the PalmPilot. This package is necessary only if
you intend to do development work. If you go this route, you'll
need to get the GNU <span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>gdb</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>binutils</b></span> packages as well. All of
this is explained in the HOWTO.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15dc580.0x16d5000"></a>Building and Installing the Software</h2></div></div><p>Building the pilot-link software is quite simple. After
you've unpacked the package (<b  >tar xvzf
pilot-link.tar.gz</b>), decide where you want to install it.
I installed it under /usr/local/pilot/. You must tell the configure
script where the installation directory is; it assumes /usr/local.
Should you also decide to install the man pages somewhere unusual,
you should tell the configure script that as well.</p><p>To build the package, run the configure script, followed by
<b  >make</b> and <b  >make install</b>. Here
is the configure command I used:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 configure --prefix=/usr/local/pilot\
     --mandir=/usr/local/man\
     --with-java=/usr/lib/java
</pre><p>The Java option was necessary to get a clean run in the
configure step. It doesn't actually cause the Java extensions to be
built&mdash;that has to be done manually, although these extensions are
not required. You can use pilot-xfer and the other tools without
the Java extensions.
</p><p>After the make install was complete, I added
/usr/local/pilot/bin to my path as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/pilot/bin
export PATH
</pre><p>At this point the pilot-link tools are ready for use with
your Pilot. There are man pages for only a few of the programs in
pilot-link, but most provide help if invoked without options or
command-line arguments.
</p><p>The Makedoc utility is a single C++ file. You can compile it
using the following command line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
g++ -DUNIX makedoc7.cpp -o makedoc
</pre><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2711f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Testing the Setup
</p></div></div>
 The HOWTO doesn't spell this out, but it was rather easy to figure
out after a short inspection of the code. Once you've built MakeDoc
you should copy it into the same directory where you installed the
pilot-link tools.</p><p>Once built, you need to test that the tools are working
properly. The first thing to do is connect your PalmPilot HotSync
cradle to your Linux box. To do this, connect the serial cable on
the cradle to one of the serial ports on your computer. The cable
on the cradle has a female connector, so you may need a gender
changer to make the connection. I use an A/B switch box to connect
both my external modem and Pilot to the same serial port
(/dev/cua1) while using the other serial port for my mouse. This
seems to work just fine, but be careful. If you switch between the
two devices while one is running it can cause you to either have to
manually reset the modem (turn it off and then on again) or reload
your Pilot. So, be careful not to change the switch box setting
while using either the modem or the Pilot.</p><p>Another thing you might want to do before trying the software
is to make a symbolic link from the serial port to which the Pilot
is connected to /dev/pilot. Most, if not all, of the tools in the
pilot-link software use /dev/pilot as the default device, although
they all take the port device as a command-line argument. Having
the /dev/pilot symbolic link makes life a little easier.</p><p>You should also make sure that the serial device has the
correct read/write permissions for whatever user ID you use while
reading and writing to the Pilot. On my system /dev/cua1 has 666
permissions so that an ordinary user can access it. I don't know if
this is a security violation or not, but it's my box&mdash;I'm the only
user and I'm not too worried about security on it.</p><p>Now that the hardware is connected, you should test that the
software can communicate with your Pilot. Place the Pilot in the
cradle, making certain that it is properly seated. (See the
instructions that come with the Pilot.) The first test you should
run is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% pilot-xfer /dev/cua1 -l
</pre><p>where /dev/cua1 is the port the Pilot is connected to. If you
aren't familiar with the serial port devices, /dev/cua0 is
generally the first serial port and /dev/cua1 is the second. There
may be others configured for your system. Once you've typed this
command you will be prompted to press the HotSync button on the
Pilot's cradle to begin the data transfer process.
</p><p>The <b  >-l</b> option for pilot-xfer will simply
list the applications currently installed on the Pilot. If this
works, you're in business. If not, check that the cable connectors
are properly fastened together. Don't forget to press the HotSync
button on the cradle once you've started the pilot-xfer
command.</p><p>If the communication between pilot-xfer and the Pilot is
working, you will get a list of the applications and databases
installed on the Pilot. The results of this command vary depending
on what else you have installed on the Pilot, but my stock
configuration looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% pilot-xfer /dev/cua1 -l
 Waiting for connection on /dev/pilot (press
     the HotSync button now)...
 Connected
 Reading list of databases...
 'System Preferences'
 'Graffiti ShortCuts'
 'AddressDB'
 'MemoDB'
 'ToDoDB'
 'DatebookDB'
 List done.
</pre><p>Once you get this command working, do a backup of your Pilot
data by typing:
<pre     class="programlisting">
pilot-xfer /dev/pilot -b `date +%Y%m%d`
</pre>


I do this in my ~/lib/pilot directory. The &ldquo;date&rdquo; is actually the
name of the directory where I want my backups placed. I use the
format YYYYMMDD so that the directories sort correctly when listed
using the <span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> command.
</p><p>Now verify the programs and databases you just backed
up:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
pilot-xfer /dev/pilot -u `date +%Y%m%d`
</pre><p>The pilot-xfer program should recognize that the data has not
changed and indicate that no changes are being made. That's what
you want.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15dc580.0x16d5c60"></a>Pilot Programs and Databases</h2></div></div><p>Pilot programs have a .prc extension. Pilot databases have a
.pdb extension. Much of the HOWTO documentation refers to all of
the files (programs and data) as &ldquo;databases&rdquo;. Unless you're going
to do development work the difference isn't important. When you
upload a .prc file to the Pilot, you've loaded a program that it
will run. The .pdb file is the data the programs will use.</p><p>There are no user programs or databases included in the
pilot-link package that you can upload to your Pilot. You can find
these at one of the many shareware sites on the Internet. The place
to start your search for Pilot applications is 3Com's official
PalmPilot site: http://palmpilot.3com.com/, which includes links to
a number of shareware and freeware sites. c|net also carries a
collection of Pilot applications you can retrieve from their
DOWNLOAD.COM site. This site also provides descriptions of the
packages, which I find very helpful.</p><p>At the 3Com site, you will also find a collection of four
games: Hardball, Minehunt, Subhunt and Puzzle. These are archived
into a zip file. 3Com refers to this as a Windows file, but it can
be used on Linux. Download it, taking care to specify a binary file
transfer if you're using FTP. (Netscape and the other browsers
should download it using a binary transfer automatically.) Once
retrieved, use <span   class="bold"><b>unzip</b></span> to unpackage
it. You should have four .prc files (file names are in uppercase)
and a README.TXT. Be sure to read the text file. Now, let's take a
look at how to upload these games to your Pilot using the
pilot-xfer program.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15dc580.0x16cc700"></a>Loading New Software and Databases</h2></div></div><p>You've already made a backup, so you are now ready to try
making changes to your Pilot. Change directories to wherever you
unpacked the games.zip file and run:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
pilot-xfer /dev/pilot -i *.PRC
</pre><p>The <b  >-i</b> option is used to install new files
into the Pilot. This command initiates the transfer of all four of
the games in the package to the Pilot. The pilot-xfer program
prompts you to press the HotSync button on the Pilot's cradle. Once
you've pressed this button, the uploads will begin. Each of the
applications uploaded will be listed by pilot-xfer. If you watch
the Pilot's screen, you'll see the real name of the package as it
is uploaded. This is the name the Pilot uses to reference the
uploaded program.
</p><p>When the upload is completed you should hear an audible
signal, after which pilot-xfer exits. The programs are now ready to
use. You can pull the Pilot out of its cradle to check that the new
games are there. Try them to make sure they are working
properly.</p><p>That's all there is to it! See how easy it is to use the
pilot-link software? As well written and easy to use as so much of
the software for Linux is, I am still amazed and impressed at the
true simplicity of the Pilot software.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15dc580.0x16cc9c0"></a>Applications</h2></div></div><p>Now it's time to look around for some decent applications.
Below is a list of some programs you may wish to look into:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>HackMaster (shareware)</p></li><li><p>AppHack (shareware)</p></li><li><p>DinkyPad (shareware)</p></li><li><p>ClockHack (freeware)</p></li><li><p>LaunchPad (shareware)</p></li><li><p>SelectHack (shareware)</p></li><li><p>utilBas (freeware)</p></li><li><p>Pilot Stopwatch (shareware)</p></li><li><p>SketchPad (freeware)</p></li></ul></div><p>All of these programs are available via links from the
DOWNLOAD.COM site, as well as from a number of other Pilot
shareware sites.</p><p>I highly recommend the HackMaster tool. It is needed in order
to use the AppHack, MenuHack and a few others. The AppHack allows
you to use the four real buttons (as opposed to the &ldquo;silk screen&rdquo;
buttons) on the Pilot to launch applications. The MenuHack allows
you to bring up the menu bars for applications by clicking on the
top line of the window. Normally you need to click on the Menu silk
screen button. LaunchPad is also a neat application. It provides a
set of user-definable notebook tabs in which you can place the
application icons. Consider it a file manager&mdash;not bad for a tiny
device like the Pilot.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15dc580.0x16cd200"></a>MakeDoc</h2></div></div><p>MakeDoc is a Linux-side tool for converting text files into a
format that can be used by the AportisDoc reader. To use MakeDoc,
run it with a command that looks similar to the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
makedoc data.txt data.prc "Data to display"
</pre><p>where data.txt is the name of the text file you want to
convert and data.prc is the name of the file you will create. The
text enclosed in double quotes will be used as the document title
in AportisDoc's list of documents. Again, once you've converted the
text file to the proper Doc format, you can upload it with
pilot-xfer as
<pre     class="programlisting">
pilot-xfer /dev/pilot -i data.txt
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15dc580.0x16cd410"></a>Managing your Data</h2></div></div><p>Once you've begun using your Pilot on a regular basis, you
will want to do backups to your Linux box. Referring to the backup
command we ran earlier,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
pilot-xfer /dev/pilot -b directory-name
</pre><p>will do a complete backup of your Pilot. To do an incremental
backup, give the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
pilot-xfer /dev/pilot -u directory-name
</pre>


The incremental backup should be done on an existing directory, but
the complete backup should be done into a new directory. Like
managing your Linux box, a good regimen of complete and incremental
backups is recommended. Currently I do complete backups weekly and
incremental backups whenever I add important data I don't want to
lose.
</p><p>Restoring lost data is fairly straightforward as well. The
command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
pilot-xfer /dev/pilot -r directory-name
</pre><p>will upload the backed up data from directory-name to your
Pilot. Pretty simple, isn't it? The pilot-xfer program can also
delete and merge databases and purge unwanted data and programs
from the Pilot.

because of its open architecture, which means it's easier for the
general public to create applications for this PDA than for some of
the other popular PDAs. Because of this openness, there are quite a
few freeware, shareware and commercial applications available for
the Pilot.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2711f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Pilot Manager Screen Shot
</p></div></div><p>The PalmPilot software available for Linux may have the best
configuration-to-usefulness ratio of any Linux software. It's a
breeze to get running and makes management of the Pilot from your
Linux box, or other UNIX systems, very simple. Since the tools are
simple in nature they can easily be incorporated into other tools.
This makes the PalmPilot a terrific addition to the ever-increasing
range of tools available for your personal and business use of
Linux.</p></div></div>
