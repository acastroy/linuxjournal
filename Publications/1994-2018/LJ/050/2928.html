    Here's another great use for Linux; Mr. Mancill tells us why his
    company picked Linux routers over the big names.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e8580.0x18e04a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Every time I deploy a Linux system for my
company, the phrase &ldquo;Linux in a production environment? It'll
never happen,&rdquo; stills echoes through my head. At a previous
employer, this was the pat answer to all of my queries as to when
we could try Linux out in our product evaluation lab. I have since
had the chance to use Linux to solve real-life problems, and I am
ready to report&mdash;&ldquo;It happens every day!&rdquo;
</p><p>This article will discuss the advantages of Linux-based WAN
routers in terms of total cost of ownership. Although many
technicians may find this approach unsavory (it certainly does not
appeal to the idealist in me), the truth is that most finance
departments are rarely interested in the technical elegance or
excellence of their IT departments. In the eyes of those signing
the checks, value is more important. Cost includes not just
hardware and software, but all related personnel and maintenance
costs.</p><p>In today's penny-conscious corporate environment, technicians
need to be cognizant of the fact many companies offer routing as a
service, which may (at least on paper) look less expensive than
your salary and equipment. Therefore, it makes good sense for
network administrators to remain conscious of the value they are
providing their employer. If you are a solutions-provider, this
article may help you increase your profit. And for those operating
with a limited budget, deploying Linux routers may be the only
choice for connecting sites to each other or to the
Internet.</p><p>Costs aside, in my opinion Linux routers do possess technical
elegance and excellence. I will focus on the functional
&ldquo;niceties&rdquo; of this platform&mdash;plus some day-to-day experiences.
For those of you already familiar with Linux, it might be
interesting to see how it is being used in a 24x7 production
environment. For those not yet using Linux, this article will
acquaint you with some of the possible applications of this
versatile and stable platform.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2928f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. WANPIPE S508/FT1 Card
</p></div></div><p>From this point on, the term &ldquo;Linux router&rdquo; will be used to
refer to an x86-based PC running Debian/GNU Linux and outfitted
with Sangoma's WANPIPE S508 router card (Figure 1). After using
this platform as an alternative to &ldquo;BigName&rdquo; traditional routers
for more than 18 months for frame-relay and Internet routers, I am
a strong proponent of this solution.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e8580.0x18e08c8"></a>Cost</h2></div></div><p>Linux routers are economical both in terms of hard costs and
the associated hidden costs in providing a routing infrastructure.
These costs include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Telco access (+ usage-based charges where
applicable)</p></li><li><p>Router hardware</p></li><li><p>Router software, upgrades and support</p></li><li><p>Personnel costs, including salary, training and
maintaining the router during day-to-day operations for both
troubleshooting and upgrades</p></li><li><p>Lost productivity and revenue due to downtime&mdash;in
the holistic view of your company's management, often quite
expensive</p></li></ul></div><p>For usage-based access methods (e.g., most types of ISDN),
monthly costs depend upon the connect-time. In this case, it is
beneficial to control when and for what reason a connection is
initiated. Many routers cannot provide this sort of control at all;
a Linux router comes equipped with schedulers and scripting
languages.</p><p>Router hardware costs can vary wildly, depending upon the
interface types and speeds, protocols supported, capabilities
provided (such as packet-filtering) and switching speed. For less
than the cost of the least expensive traditional router that
supports a V.35 interface, you can have equivalent connectivity
with superior functionality and supportability using a Linux
router.</p><p>An easily overlooked cost of working with digital circuits
(other than ISDN) is the CSU/DSU, which is used to interface your
router to your telco access. This device understands the signaling
on the digital access line, e.g., a T-1, and converts it into a bit
stream on a V.35 interface. They can be expensive. The Sangoma S508
is offered with an integrated CSU/DSU which saves money and makes
cabling and mounting easier.</p><p>The cost of router software, hardware and software upgrades,
as well as the cost of yearly support agreements for router
hardware and software, can be significant. (Traditional support is
often 10 to 15% or more of the new price of the hardware per year.)
These costs approach zero for the Linux router solution. The
operating system, including tools and upgrades, is free. The PC
hardware is inexpensive, and because the requirements are so modest
it can often be inherited from others trying to upgrade their
desktops for more horsepower. (All of my systems are
&ldquo;hand-me-downs&rdquo;.)</p><p>Even more important than the base hardware costs, Linux
routers offer investment protection since you have a clear upgrade
path for all aspects of your router. Additional links can be added
for cost of another Sangoma card. Mixing links and media types is
simple and inexpensive. For example, if you wish to upgrade your
LAN backbone to 100Mbps or to ATM, adapters for our BigName router
cost about $4000.00 each, but for Linux any decent 100Mbps Ethernet
card will work fine. Faster switching is merely a motherboard/CPU
upgrade.</p><p>Now and then someone will quip that a PC is not fast enough
to be a WAN router. I think this statement shows a lack of
imagination. If this were true, there would be no point in having
100Mbps Ethernet cards. How can you expect your desktop to send or
receive packets at 100Mbps when it is not able to read+send packets
arriving at 1/100th of that rate?</p><p>Packet-filtering, address translation (IP-masquerading) and
proxying are often add-ons for traditional routers. By contrast,
adding this functionality to a Linux router is free, and easier to
install and manage.</p><p>BigName router software upgrades can be time-consuming.
Unless you have spare BigName routers, practicing your upgrade is
not an option. This is even worse when you have both &ldquo;BigName X&rdquo;
and &ldquo;BigName Y&rdquo; routers. Different procedures, different problems
and phone support for any of them can be expensive. Having more
than one closed-system router vendor also means more money for
training and more &ldquo;fragmentation&rdquo; of the skill-sets of your
support staff. Instead of three capable generalists, you have one
person trained for X, one for Y and a third who tries to keep
up.</p><p>This leads to another part of the cost of providing routing
services. How much does it cost to have people tend to the
environment? Salary, training, time spent configuring, developing
reports, upgrading and troubleshooting are all part of the total
cost of ownership. I would say that this is the most important
reason to seriously consider Linux as a router platform. First of
all, there is an ever-increasing supply of talent that has
experience with Linux. This keeps salaries for support staff
reasonable. (Try to find enough money to hire a BigName
specialist.) Even salty UNIX administrators feel at home on Linux
systems, once again increasing the resource pool, providing backup
support and easing cross-training within your IT department. This
element of commonality cannot be stressed enough. Secondly,
configuring a Linux router uses the same tools as configuring the
network card on any UNIX system. Anyone who feels comfortable at a
shell prompt and understands TCP/IP is a potential resource. This
is important, because at some point, your environment will need
support.</p><p>Maintenance of WAN networks tends to be infrequent but
intense. Problems tend to occur at 2:00AM six months after you last
touched your BigName router. (You are most likely at home, sitting
in your bathrobe, dialed-in to your office. What are the chances
you have the manuals at hand?) By contrast, a Linux router uses
many of the same tools you work with every day, and you have all of
the documentation on-line in the form of man pages or text files.
You may not have worked with the router for a while, but you use
<span   class="bold"><b>ifconfig</b></span> and look at
/var/log/messages each day. Even the hardware-specific tools tend
to be more fully featured and easier to use. For instance, Figure 2
is a screen showing Linux PPP statistics as monitored from an
attached workstation.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2928f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Screenshot of Linux PPP Monitoring on Attached
Workstation
</p></div></div><p>For day-to-day troubleshooting, you have a whole suite of
tools at your fingertips that you can use to hack your way around
the problem. And because these tools are familiar, your problem
resolution time is shorter. A <span   class="emphasis"><em>keep-alive</em></span> ping
script may not be the prettiest solution, but it will keep you out
of reactive mode long enough to research the real problem. When I
was younger and very naive, I believed that when you bought a piece
of hardware or software from a BigName it was fully debugged. This
is ridiculous&mdash;all code has bugs in it. The real question is&mdash;what
options do you have to deal with these bugs?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e8580.0x18e13c8"></a>Linux in the Production Environment</h2></div></div><p>Another plus for Linux routers is they can run additional
services and programs. At your disposal is an entire OS family of
services and applications with 20+ years of debugging and
fine-tuning. Because UNIX has always promoted a tool box
philosophy, the only real limit to what other services your routers
can provide is your imagination. Here are some ideas:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Deploy secondary services for more redundancy. For
example, a router can act as a secondary DNS server or a secondary
SMTP gateway.</p></li><li><p>Configure the router for a remote site to act as a
slave DNS and a caching HTTP proxy&mdash;perhaps even Samba for file and
print services.</p></li><li><p>Deploy a &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; Internet router&mdash;use the
same machine for the external DNS name server, an SMTP
mail-exchanger, an NTP server for your site and an Internet
firewall.</p></li></ul></div><p>Linux also provides flexible packet-filtering, SOCKS,
proxying solutions, PPTP and IP-masquerading. For those who have
special needs, there are modules for shaping traffic patterns
(throttling the bandwidth of certain types of traffic or traffic
between given hosts).</p><p>Deploying multipurpose systems also makes sense in terms of
reliability. Having fewer concentrated points of failure typically
increases the average uptime of an office, because the possibility
of hardware failure is equal to the sum of the possibilities of
failure of the individual components. Therefore, fewer multipurpose
systems should result in a lower overall chance of failure. Be
careful though: lumping services together means that multiple
services will be down simultaneously. You should always consider
the interaction of the services you are combining and try to
combine services that would be useless anyway if the router were to
fail.</p><p>It is hard to exaggerate the importance of reliability for a
routing platform. Unreliable systems do not just cost money: they
can utterly kill your business. Worse than that, they can cause you
to get paged during non-work-related activities (like
sleeping).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e8580.0x18e1840"></a>Tips for Running Linux in the Production
Environment</h2></div></div><p>You might find some of the following tips helpful. Many of
them were learned the hard way.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Back up your system regularly. (I have had good
luck with BRU from EST Software.)</p></li><li><p>/var should be a separate partition because it is
going to hold all of your spools and log files.</p></li><li><p>Make a set of rescue floppies. My rescue floppies
include Debian rescue disk, bootable DOS disk with the
configuration utilities for my Ethernet cards and bootable DOS disk
with Sangoma's snooper.exe (a sniffer utility for their
communications cards).</p></li><li><p>Keep all of your system scripts in a common
location, e.g., /us/local/bin or ~sysacct/bin and use a common
header format for all of your scripts that includes a history of
changes. This saves you time by reminding you of what you did and
when, and helps others who may inherit or need to modify your
scripts. The first 2-letter field contains initials, when more than
one person has access to your environment. All my scripts start
like this:</p></li></ul></div><pre     class="programlisting">
     #!/usr/bin/ksh
     # name_of_script [cmdline args]
     # [description of script, if needed]
     # modification history:
     # tm970612initial release
     # ls970923added functionality X
     # tm980115most recent edit
     MAIL_TO="tmancill@us.lhsgroup.com"
</pre><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Remain security conscious. Change passwords
regularly, and use <span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> or a
similar program to protect against internal TCP/IP snoopers. Use
PGP or a similar program for sharing sensitive information with
others.</p></li><li><p>Have spare components available. Linux is tolerant
of changing hardware, so you can move the hard drive to a different
system without problems. A spare communications adapter and an IDE
hard disk loaded with the base OS plus kernel source should
suffice.</p></li><li><p>Reboot your system after any (major) configuration
changes, e.g., changes to the routing tables specified in the
start-up scripts. If this cannot be done right away, schedule a
time to do it. This is suggested not because Linux needs to be
rebooted for the changes to take effect, but more because it runs
so long without needing to be rebooted. The &ldquo;reboot-test&rdquo;
provides some insurance against Murphy's Law. Otherwise, your
system will most likely be rebooted when you are not around, by an
NT-administrator trying to log in with
<b  >CTRL-ALT-DEL</b> six months after you have made any
changes to it whatsoever. If it cannot restart without
intervention, the NT-administrator will be mucking about on your
system until you show up and are confused as to why the system is
acting funny because you cannot remember the last changes you
made.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Understand</em></span> TCP/IP&mdash;ports,
routing, variable subnetting, DNS, the differences between TCP and
UDP, etc. This cannot be overstated. Downtime statistics for large
production environments are alarming in that they often show
human-error as the number one cause of failure. (Linux test beds
are cheap; practice on a spare system. Because communication
adapters under Linux work just like Ethernet devices, you can
simulate your WAN environment with extra Ethernet cards and a
separate Ethernet segment.)</p></li><li><p>Keep documentation on your systems. It does not
have to be much&mdash;just note how each system varies from the base OS
load.</p></li><li><p>Keep your head when things get hectic.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e8580.0x18d8ac8"></a>Additional Benefits of Open Systems</h2></div></div><p>People sometimes tell me that GPL software, because it's
free, does not have the quality to be part of a production
environment. This is like saying that only authors with publishing
contracts write good poetry. When I hear this, I always have to
wonder if these people have ever even used GPL software or know how
much they depend upon it every time they browse the Web or receive
e-mail from the Internet.</p><p>There are some very distinct advantages in source code
availability for network administrators. As the Internet continues
to evolve, along with protocols, security measures and resource
conservation techniques, routers will have to keep up.</p><p>Five years ago, the shortcomings of IPv4, and the need for
protocol encryption and encapsulation might have been far-fetched
ideas, suited only for the minds of IETF gurus. Today you deal with
them each time you use IP-masquerading or PPTP. Because of its
openness and its rich tool set, Linux makes an ideal platform for
developing and testing these sorts of protocol extensions (e.g.,
IPv6 and ENSKIP). As a network administrator running on Linux,
these tools will often be available to you sooner than in
commercial implementations. And they will be written by someone who
not only wants to see the software work, but also uses the software
himself; not by someone trying to meet a coding deadline. Because
Linux is not in commercial competition, the focus is on
interoperability, not on proprietary protocol extensions. Looking
forward, it is difficult to say what we will be running in the year
2005. I do, however, feel certain that developing these tools in a
robust, open operating system must be substantially easier than
developing for proprietary architectures with more limited tools
and support. Therefore, I feel better supported.</p><p>Good support and vendor stability are essential aspects of
any large IT investment. I never have to worry that Linux is going
to go out of business or be purchased by another company and then
discontinued. As for WAN routing hardware for Linux systems, I have
the feeling that it will be around as long as there is a market for
it. If my communications hardware vendor does ever go out of
business, I'm not left hung out to dry as I would be with a
traditional router. I have the source code for the drivers and can
continue to adapt and enhance for as long as it is functional and
economically feasible to do so.</p><p>Just because you paid for support does not mean that you will
get it. Arguments to the effect that &ldquo;we cannot use Linux because
we cannot get support&rdquo; are flawed. Typically, they are made by a
management that does not believe employees are capable of
performing their jobs. The largest percentage of my experience with
vendor support can be categorized in one of these ways:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Completely wasted time trying to explain the
problem to someone who has no idea what I'm talking about.</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Have you tried our latest patch/reloading the
software?&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;It sounds like it has nothing to do with our
system/software.&rdquo;</p></li></ol></div><p>Troubleshooting IT problems can be difficult and
time-consuming, and no one can afford to staff their help desk with
their top programmers and troubleshooters. So since you will have
to troubleshoot a large majority of your problems yourself, why pay
for support?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e8580.0x18d8ff0"></a>Linux as a Router in Production</h2></div></div><p>My firm has offices in the United States, Europe and Asia. As
an international company, WAN connections are an important part of
the infrastructure. Because of the time zone differences between
our sites, it is critical to have a stable routing platform;
midnight in one location is high noon in another, so maintenance
windows are small. Just like any other company, we are conscious of
costs. To meet these goals, we use Linux/Sangoma routers
for:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>512Kbps link to the Internet</p></li><li><p>1.5Mbps frame-relay</p></li><li><p>56Kbps backup link to the Internet</p></li></ul></div><p>We intend to deploy three more Linux/Sangoma frame-relay
routers this year. In addition, we use Linux as a LAN router, a
server platform for all of the standard TCP/IP services (DNS, FTP,
HTTP, packet-filtering, IP-masquerading, proxying, SMTP, NTP, NNTP,
etc.) and, of course, as a desktop.</p><p>The actual configuration of our Linux frame-relay router is
GNU/Debian Linux (version 1.2) running on a 486/66 with 8MB RAM, a
850MB IDE hard drive, a Sangoma WANPIPE S508 router card and a
SpellCaster DataCommute ISDN card. The ISDN card is used as a
backup, in case the frame-relay fails. This system had been up for
over 160 days before it was rebooted by a sadly mistaken
NT-administrator trying to log into another system that shares the
same keyboard and monitor.</p><p>If you're wondering why I went to the trouble to write an
article about using Linux as a router, maybe the following anecdote
will help explain it.</p><p>Once upon a time, our Internet link was connected with a
BigName router. One day, this router decided to die. In total, it
took about an hour to get a technician from BigName on the phone;
we whiled away the time scrambling around looking for our support
ID, wading through the &ldquo;press six if you'd like to use our
fax-back server&rdquo; menus, waiting on hold and fending off frantic
users. After a short discussion about my abilities to configure a
terminal program (peppered with a few curt remarks of my own about
what sort of idiot cable was needed to access the console), the
technician decided that we needed a new motherboard. Since we had
paid copiously for our support contract, a new board was to arrive
the next day. We informed our users of the situation and eagerly
awaited our package. A package did arrive promptly the next day by
the promised time. However, much to our dismay, we had received a
new power-supply and case&mdash;no motherboard.</p><p>Now we were in trouble. BigName was going to send us our
part, but that meant at least another 24 hours of downtime. Based
on our experience with the Linux frame-relay router, we decided to
try our spare Sangoma S508 card for this link. We had Linux loaded
and the software configured in about an hour. We started the
WANPIPE software and nothing happened. Using the
<span   class="bold"><b>ppipemon</b></span> utility that comes with
the Sangoma product, we were able to tell that the link was failing
in the LCP negotiation phase. That is, our router was talking to
the ISP's router, but they could not mutually agree on an operating
parameter set for the link. It is fortunate that we had these
tools. Our ISP was telling us that they were quite certain that we
had no routing hardware whatsoever attached to the line. This
despite the fact that we could tell them the exact data streams we
were receiving from their router.</p><p>In desperation, we called Sangoma to see if they were
familiar with this sort of behavior. They were not, but offered to
look at the output of a data trace. We collected a few seconds of
the failing negotiation sequence and mailed this to Sangoma. Less
than four hours later, I received a call from an engineer at
Sangoma who told me there was a nebulous portion of the PPP RFC
which had been implemented by our ISP's port multiplexor. Best of
all, Sangoma had already placed a patch on their FTP server.
Fifteen minutes later we were up and running. Although the
motherboard did arrive from BigName, we have never gone back. This
router sits in storage as a backup to our backup. In looking back
at the sequence of events, I am impressed by the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>We were better equipped with tools to troubleshoot
problems than our ISP. Maybe we were just more motivated, but I
have to question the integrity of either the technician or the
tools when I am interrupted while listing the sequence of LCP
packets with &ldquo;Are you sure the router is powered on and attached
to the CSU/DSU?&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>We were able to get a patch in less than a
day.</p></li><li><p>We were able to turn an outage of at least 48 hours
into less than 30, and it would have been even less than that if we
had been quicker to consider using the Linux router. (In a
production environment that strives to have 99.5% availability, you
have 43.8 hours a year for maintenance and downtime.)</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e8580.0x18d9830"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The intent of this article is not to say that Linux routers
will make traditional routing hardware obsolete. When considering
routing hardware, make sure that the tool fits the job at hand. If
you have a T-3 to the Internet or want to tie together remote sites
with ATM, you probably need to be shopping for equipment designed
explicitly to switch and route packets at those speeds. By the same
token, why go to the extra expense and trouble to deploy a
special-purpose piece of hardware, along with all of the
inconveniences that come with it, when you only need to route
128Kbps or even 1.5Mbps?</p><p>Because no one can foresee all of the demands that will be
placed on their routing environment, flexibility and expandability
are desirable in any solution. The Linux kernel is rapidly
supporting increasingly more sophisticated types of traffic-shaping
and packet monitoring. Routing hardware, including the processor,
can be upgraded inexpensively. Furthermore, this same hardware can
provide additional functions. Finally, a Linux router comes
equipped with a complete set of familiar tools for monitoring and
customization.</p><p>For a minimal investment in hardware and time, you can try a
Linux router for a new link or to act as a backup for your current
link(s). If you are new to data communications or need support, you
are more likely to find a Linux hacker who can read (which is all
it takes to get a Sangoma card running) than to find a BigName
router guru. Typically, Linux folks are pretty friendly and willing
to help. After all, some of this stuff is just neat. For business
environments, the availability of Linux talent is increasing, and
training for this environment is substantially less expensive than
for closed-systems. Because Linux is open, your investment of time
and capital is better protected. Give it a try. You will not regret
it!</p><p><a href="2928s1.html" target="_self">Glossary</a></p></div></div>
