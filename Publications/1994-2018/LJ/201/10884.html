Finally, open-source cloning that delivers.

The practice of cloning is a time-tested standard operating procedure in many IT shops. It can
assist in migrations and building test/lab environments, and it enhances system
recovery processes. Due to the tremendous utility of cloning, there
also is a healthy market of commercial cloning tools, each with their
own unique abilities. Unfortunately, most of these commercial tools offer
limited support for Linux. Enter Clonezilla, an open-source suite of
cloning tools developed by Taiwan's National Center for High-Performance
Computing (NCHC) software lab under the GPL that works impeccably
with Linux distributions. Clonezilla boasts high-performance cloning,
simplified deployment and support for a multitude of system types
(Windows, Linux and VMware), all of which make it a worthy competitor to
its commercial counterparts.
</p><p>
In this article, I describe two common cloning scenarios where
Clonezilla performs serviceably in place of commercial cloning suites. In
the first scenario, I install Clonezilla Server Edition (SE) and
Diskless Remote Boot Linux (DRBL) on a Linux server for use as a central
imaging solution in the enterprise. In the second scenario, I focus
on Clonezilla's disaster recovery (DR) abilities using the Live version
to create a custom recovery solution for a critical system.
</p><p>
For the first scenario, I have chosen to deploy DRBL and Clonezilla
on CentOS 5.5 server, although both programs work on a multitude of
distributions. Prior to selecting server hardware, you need to make two
decisions. The first is how many networks you want to use with DRBL. It is
recommended to run DRBL services on a nonproduction network segment. As a
result, DRBL is best run on a server with more than one NIC, specifically
where one NIC is connected to your production network and a second NIC
is connected to a dedicated cloning network. Clonezilla is scalable,
so you can have multiple NICs in a server dedicated to different
imaging segments. This is a common network design for test labs and
classroom environments. You can use a single NIC with an alias for your
imaging network, but you'll be running two IPs on one card, which is not
recommended. Let's keep deployment simple by using two NICs in the
server, with one plugged in to the production and the second plugged in to
the imaging network. 
</p><p>
After deciding on your network configuration, you
need to decide where you want to store the cloned images. If you want to
use your DRBL/Clonezilla server for storage, you may need to plan for a
larger hard drive or storage array to accommodate the size of your image
library. You also may have an existing large-capacity high-speed storage
network, like a SAN, that performs better over the network when cloning
multiple images at once. In that case, you can use remote mountpoints
with your networked storage to house the images. I've kept it simple
here and used the directly attached hard drive in my server, as it has
enough room for everything.
</p><p>
With the hardware in place, install CentOS using an installation image
from one of the distribution's mirrors. Select whatever install options
you require, but it is recommended that you disable any firewalls and
SELinux. Once the CentOS installation is complete, download and install
the DRBL rpm package from the project's SourceForge site. When the rpm
completes installation, open a terminal console and run the following
command to finalize the DRBL install and create the PXE image client
files:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/opt/drbl/sbin/drblsrv -i
</pre>
</p><p>
After entering the above command, you are presented with a series
of prompts. For our purposes, you can accept all of the defaults,
but make sure to read them to understand what is occurring during
the DRBL installation. Because I used the i386 version of the CentOS
distribution, I had to upgrade to the i686 version before DRBL would begin
the installation. When this process is complete, enter the following
command to configure the DRBL server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/opt/drbl/sbin/drblpush -i
</pre>
</p><p>
This launches the DRBL configuration script in interactive mode. As with
the drblsrv script, you can accept most of the default options. When
prompted to configure the network, assign eth0 as the public Internet
(WAN) connection. After that, any other active NICs found by the script
are placed on their own DRBL segment. You then are prompted for the
initial number of the IP address you want to use. This is the starting
number your DRBL clients will receive in the last octet of their IP
address from DHCP. At the next prompt, enter the number of DRBL clients you
want to use with this server. This number will increment the IP addresses
used on the server. For example, if you entered 100 as the first number
and 12 as the second, you can use up to 12 client machines assigned
with the IP addresses 192.168.162.100&ndash;192.168.162.111 with your imaging
server. When all prompts have been answered, you are presented with a
visual representation of your DRBL network environment (Figure 1). Press
Enter to continue. When prompted for the DRBL and Clonezilla modes,
select the defaults of Full DRBL and Full Clonezilla mode. It then
will ask you for the directory to store images. This directory can be local
or remote storage. Based on our earlier decision, leave the default as
a local folder named /home/partimag. After these prompts, you can accept
the rest of the defaults. When you have answered all the prompts, the
script will create instances of the DRBL client (based on your distro)
for each IP address allotted from the configuration. DRBL configuration
is now complete.

</p></div></div><p>
Next, run the following command from a console to launch the Clonezilla
setup script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/opt/drbl/sbin/dcs
</pre>
</p><p>
Select All Clients from the first screen. Set the mode to Clonezilla-start
and then Beginner mode. On the resulting screen, choose select-in-client
Save/Restore in the Client. This gives you the flexibility to select
either operation at the client. You can accept the rest of the defaults
until the script exits. You may want to experiment with these options
further, as they can help streamline the cloning process. To make a
configuration change to your DRBL or Clonezilla server, simply rerun
the drblsrv, drblpush or dcs script again. If you make a change that
involves the PXE setup, it always is a good idea to blow away any existing
PXE image profiles (a prompt in the drblpush script) to make sure your
new settings override any previous ones.
</p><p>
With the server in place, let's move on to creating and cloning the base
desktop image. Many things must be taken into account when building the
base image. First, partition/use only the minimum amount of storage space
necessary to fit on the smallest drive to which you plan to clone. Clonezilla
supports restoring a cloned image to a larger drive, but it will not
restore to a smaller drive than the one found in the image. If your target
disk is larger than the image being restored, you can use free partition
tools like GParted or PartedMagic to expand the restored OS to use some
or all of the free space on the local disk. GParted is nice because it
can be added to a PXE server or run from a live CD (Figure 2). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10884f2.large.jpg"><img src="10884f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. GParted in Action
</p></div></div><p>
The second
caveat is to use like-to-like hardware between the base image and the
target machines as much as possible. Differences in hardware from the base
to target machines can cause a multitude of issues when cloning. Some items,
such as memory and hard drives, are not critical, but switching system
components, such as motherboards and processors, can cause a host of
issues. For most people, this is not a problem, as many administrators
already work highly standardized environments. 
</p><p>
Third and last, build your
OS on a pristine machine or &ldquo;bare metal&rdquo;. If experience has taught me
anything, it is to start with a clean slate. After installing the desktop
OS on your base image, install only those programs absolutely necessary
to your deployment, and avoid installing any antivirus, backup agents
or desktop management clients before cloning. Anything that requires a
unique identifier should be left off the base image. After installing
all required software, make sure the machine shuts down cleanly. For
my base image, I have built a vanilla installation of openSUSE with
OpenOffice.org for redeployment on my target machines.
</p><p>
After preparing the OS on your base machine and powering it down, you need
to make it talk to the DRBL server. You can accomplish this by using the
Pre-Boot eXecution Environment (PXE, pronounced &ldquo;pixie&rdquo;). PXE provides
a shell for a thin OS that runs in local memory and provides direct
access to local data outside the installed OS&mdash;a prerequisite for
most cloning programs. If not already enabled on your target hardware,
PXE can be enabled on most motherboards in the BIOS. Once enabled,
connect the base machine to the DRBL network segment, and boot from it as
a source by either setting it in the boot order or using a boot menu (usually
accessed by pressing a function key prior to the bootloader screen).
</p><p>
Upon booting from PXE, the client should pick up an address from the DRBL
server (also running DHCP) and present you with a GRUB-loader screen
(Figure 3). Leave the default selection of &ldquo;Clonezilla: choose save or
restore later&rdquo; to load Clonezilla into memory via TFTP. Once Clonezilla
has loaded, select the following options to capture your base image
on the server: device-image, Beginner mode and savedisk. Provide a name
for the image and choose the local disk as the source. When prompted,
confirm you want to run the script and capture the image. Clonezilla will
launch the appropriate cloning program (partclone, partimage, ntfsclone,
dd) and begin capturing the disk to image (Figure 4). When the image
capture has been completed, power down the base machine.

Figure 4. Capturing the Disk to Image
</p></div></div><p>
With your image stored on the server, you can simultaneously clone up to
12 end systems. Restoring a cloned image to a new machine via PXE
follows the same procedure as capturing it, with the exception that you
need to select the restore-disk option, and if you store multiple images
on the server, you need to specify which image to restore. Depending on
the OS contained in your image, further steps may be needed after
the restore. At a bare minimum, you will want to change each newly cloned
machine's hostname. If you are restoring a Microsoft OS, you need
to change the Security Identifier (SID) so as not to cause problems in
your domain. You can avoid this issue with Windows XP clients and higher
by using the sysprep utility pre-clone.
</p><p>
As long as everything went smoothly, you now have a working DRBL and
Clonezilla SE server that you can use to mass clone devices on your network as
often as needed.
</p><p>
For the second scenario, let's use the Live version of Clonezilla to create a recovery
CD/DVD for a critical system. This is handy for near-line backups and/or off-site
storage, but it also can double as a method for mass cloning systems if you lack the
network infrastructure to use DRBL and PXE. If you are an OEM builder, you can use
Clonezilla in this way to create recovery CDs for inclusion with your systems, like
the big PC manufacturers have done for years. Recovery discs also can supplement
change management processes&mdash;for example, if you have a server that requires high
availability that is in need of major software upgrade. By capturing the server in its
current state prior to the upgrade, you have a viable rollback plan should the upgrade
go awry.
</p><p>
The recovery disc creation process includes two parts: taking a backup
image of the machine and then creating the CD itself. Many of the same
caveats apply to capturing an image using the Live version of Clonezilla
as they did in the earlier scenario with two major differences. One, the
system disk or partition to be restored must fit on a single CD or DVD
along with all of the files needed to create the disc. Using a dual-layer
DVD means you tap out at approximately 8.54GB. This is not a huge problem
because, as mentioned earlier, you can expand the restored partition using
GParted or other tools post-clone. Two, unlike a base system that may be
restored multiple times over, you will want to configure this host as much
as possible to minimize recovery time. If you suffer total server loss
due to a catastrophic event and are forced to use a recovery disc,
you do not want to spend additional time editing configurations. This
works well for static servers that don't change much or servers with
highly unique and, therefore, time-consuming configurations. You may need
to shift this approach for dynamic servers like database servers, but
you still can use a recovery disc to reduce recovery time. In this case,
build the server, install and configure the database engine (for example, MySQL)
without any databases and capture it. Then, if you need to go back to the
recovery image, the only additional step needed for full recovery is to
restore the database onto the newly restored OS. For my test scenario,
I used a DNS server running on CentOS 5.5 as my critical system.
</p><p>
To get started, download the Clonezilla Live .iso file from SourceForge and
burn it to a CD. Place the Clonezilla Live CD in your system and boot from
it (Figure 5). At the boot menu, accept the default option for Clonezilla
Live. When prompted, accept the same Clonezilla options previously
selected for capturing an image (Start Clonezilla, device-image and so on),
and when prompted for a mountpoint for /home/partimag, select somewhere
other than the local disk you want to clone. I used a USB hard drive, so
I selected the local_dev option. Leave the defaults on the option &ldquo;Select
the top directory to store the image file&rdquo; to store it on the root of
your chosen storage device. Complete the selections using the same options
chosen earlier for capturing an image. When the clone process is finished,
return to the console by pressing Enter and selecting &ldquo;(3) Start over&rdquo;.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10884f5.large.jpg"><img src="10884f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The Clonezilla Live Boot Screen
</p></div></div><p>
With your image captured, you now can build the recovery disc. Select the
same options as above to start Clonezilla (device-image, local-dev,
mount USB as /home/partimag), but then select Beginner Mode and
&ldquo;recovery-iso-zip Create_recovery_Clonezilla_Live&rdquo; (Figure 6). Select
the image that was just captured as the image to restore, and confirm
that the destination device to be restored matches the mount label of the
critical system (that is, sda, hda1). Leave the language and keymap options
the defaults. Select .iso as the recovery file type. If prompted that
the target .iso file is too large to fit on a CD, answer yes to create
the file anyway. Clonezilla will start building the .iso file in the
root of the USB drive and include the captured image in the .iso image
(Figure 7). At the end of the process, power off the machine using the
prompts. Burn the resulting .iso from the USB hard drive to a CD or DVD
depending on the size.

</p></div></div><p>
To test the recovery disc, boot from it and select the default option
from the bootloader screen, which will default to &ldquo;Clonezilla Live&rdquo;
with the name of your img file (Figure 8). The recovery disc then
will bypass the usual Clonezilla selection screens, immediately launch the
appropriate cloning program and ask for confirmation to overwrite your
drive with the image on the disc (Figure 9). If all went well, you now
have a good copy of your system to use in case of emergency.

In this article, I've walked through the two most popular uses for
Clonezilla, but they are by no means the only ones. One emerging trend
is using Clonezilla to capture images of physical systems for
redeployment on virtual servers&mdash;a process known as physical-to-virtual
conversion (P2V). Others have combined Clonezilla
Live with the popular System Rescue CD and built a powerful rescue CD
called Clonezilla-SysRescCD. There are a multitude of uses for the suite and
its components, but for all its utility, Clonezilla does lack some of the
nicer features found in the commercial cloning suites. Those missing
features include the ability to clone a running system,
take differential (delta) images and restore to dissimilar hardware or
&ldquo;bare-metal&rdquo; restores. Still, those features come at a premium and are
not always easy to implement. In the end, Clonezilla is a common-sense
tool that does its job well for all types of systems&mdash;not just those
that don't end in *nix.
