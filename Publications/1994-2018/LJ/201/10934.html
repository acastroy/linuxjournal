Opera Browser</h2></div></div><p>
The new version 11 of Opera, the veteran of Web browsers for Linux,
took the next step in its evolution by adding extension functionality.
Developers can author, upload and share these browser add-ons, which
utilize Opera's APIs, as well as Web standards like HTML5 and JavaScript.
These standards allow extensions made for other browsers to be tweaked
and shared with 50 million Opera desktop users. Previously, extensions
were limited to Opera Widgets and Opera Unite applications. Opera checks
all extensions before they are made public to ensure that the catalog
of extensions is free from defects and malicious software. Opera 11
runs on Linux, Mac OS and Windows.

Linutop OS</h2></div></div><p>
The miserly and miniature Linutop PC just got a brain implant in the
form of the new Linutop OS 4.0, a small and secure Ubuntu-based operating
system. The OS also works on other x86 PCs. Version 4's key new addition
is the kiosk configuration, which allows for quick-and-simple customized
configuration&mdash;for example, in secured public Internet access, digital signage,
network monitoring, thin-client use, mini-servers and low-cost desktops
in virtualized environments. Other benefits include a small, 700MB
footprint, low power requirements and the ability to back up the entire
OS on a USB drive.

Maureen Broderick's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Art of Managing Professional
Services</em></span> (Wharton
School)</h2></div></div><p>
Farming out services is something nearly all of us have engaged in
at some level. If you think you've got the stuff to break out beyond
frantic calls from grandma, you may want to pick up Maureen Broderick's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Art of Managing Professional Services: Insights from Leaders of the
World's Top Firms</em></span>. The book is a guide to building and managing a professional
service firm. According to Broderick, aspects like infrastructure,
governance, talent acquisition and retention, compensation and
financial management vary significantly from traditional corporate
environments. Furthermore, conventional management advice doesn't offer
all the answers, and mainstream business gurus rarely address the unique
challenges facing professional service firm leaders. Insights are offered
based on 130 in-depth interviews with leaders of the world's top firms.

SoleraTec's Phoenix RSM Module for OnSSI System</h2></div></div><p>
The data protection solution provider SoleraTec has expanded the
functionality of its flagship OnSSI video management system with the
new Phoenix RSM Module. This new module extracts and replicates video
feeds at high speed while maintaining the original video quality and
resolution. By replicating video into the Phoenix RSM forensic storage
solution, organizations can greatly expand their retention abilities
and provide stronger, comprehensive management of all recorded video.
Users quickly can search and play back video footage, regardless of when
the video was recorded or where it is stored. Organizations can capture
and store huge amounts of video surveillance footage that easily can be 
searched and retrieved for playback. The optional H.264 lossless format
reduces storage requirements up to 70% while preserving original image
quality, allowing for greatly increased content on the same storage space.

eGauge Systems' eGauge2</h2></div></div><p>
Inside sources at eGauge Systems tipped us off to the fact that their new
eGauge2 Web-based electric energy and power meter is powered by Linux.
eGauge2, now 40% smaller than its predecessor, is used to measure and
record whole-house consumption, renewable (such as solar and wind) energy
generation, and individual loads, such as appliances or geothermal
system pumps and backup heaters. It can measure up to 12 circuits on
up to 3-phases (120V&ndash;480V, 50&ndash;60Hz). The data can be viewed on
any Web-enabled device through the built-in Web-server, and the device
records the most recent 30 years of data in its built-in solid-state
memory. The measurements also can be accessed through BACnet and/or the
recorded data can be shared with Google PowerMeter.

Graebert's ARES Commander Edition 2D/3D CAD</h2></div></div><p>
Given how good we Linux geeks have been this year, Santa Claus (via his
agents at Graebert GmbH) is treating us to a new CAD
application, namely ARES Commander Edition Version 1.0 2D/3D CAD.
Graebert says that ARES Commander Edition is a powerful and
affordable 3D CAD solution that is fully capable of supporting both
AEC (Architecture/Engineering/Construction) and MCAD (Mechanical CAD)
and the ability to exchange files across all three supported
OS platforms, Linux, Mac OS and Windows seamlessly. Users also have a choice of
experiencing a fully Linux-specific UI or a more tailored UI that matches
the Windows version, both of which are fully command-compatible with
AutoCAD. A free 30-day trial is available for download from Graebert's
Web site.
