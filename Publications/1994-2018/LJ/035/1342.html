    Originally designed for controlling consumer electronics,
    the I2C bus is easily adapted to working with Linux to
    control a variety of devices using the I2C bus standard.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee4580.0x1fdc298"></a></h2></div></div><p>The I2C bus is a two-wire serial bus for
connecting a wide range of ICs to a computer or micro-controller.
It was originally developed by Phillips in the early '80s, but is
now supported by a wide range of companies.
</p><p>I first stumbled over this bus when I still had my old
Commodore C64, while looking over some hardware books. I never
built an adapter, so I forgot about it, until I started to hack
around in the Linux kernel. Then I thought building an adapter and
writing a corresponding kernel module to access the bus a character
device would be a promising goal.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee4580.0x1fdc3f8"></a>Description of the Bus</h2></div></div><p>The I2C bus consists of two lines, one for the data and one
for the clock. The chips connect to the bus via open collector
input/output stages, which cause the lines to be high when
idle.</p><p>Transmission is initiated via a start condition, after which
an address byte is transmitted. The byte consists of a 7-bit device
address and a direction bit. If a slave recognizes its own address,
it acknowledges the transmission. Then, any number of bytes can be
transmitted to the slave, until the last byte is not acknowledged.
Transmission ends with a stop condition.</p><p>The data is transferred synchronously with the high state of
the clock line, when the state of the data signal has to be stable.
This rule is broken only for the generation of the start and stop
conditions, which encapsulate a transmission. Transfer speed is not
fixed, but specifications guarantee speeds up to 100 kHz. If a
device cannot cope with the transmission speed it may hold down the
clock line, and thus slow the process.</p><p>When considering the data transmission rate, we can thus only
assume the best case, as there are no lower limits. With 100 kHz
(i.e., 100 kbps), we need 2 bits for start and stop, 9 bits for the
address (including the acknowledge bit), and 18 bits for the data
if we want to read two bytes. All in all, with an
inter-transmission gap of an additional bit, we have an effective
data acquisition rate of 100 k/30 bps, or 3333 samples per second.
Therefore, one can see the I2C bus cannot be used for audio data,
or other high-speed applications, but it is still fast enough to
easily survey an array of sensor devices and react in under a
millisecond.</p><p>Also, several extensions exist to the basic specification of
the bus. One extension is a fast mode which allows transmission of
data at rates up to 400 kHz. Another extension in the address space
supports 10-bit wide identifiers. The Access.bus implements a
software protocol on top of the I2C-bus hardware in order to
communicate with computer peripherals.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee4580.0x1fdc660"></a>From Consumer Electronics to Radio
Communications</h2></div></div><p>The chips available for the bus cover a wide range of needs.
Originally the bus was designed for computer-controlled TV sets,
resulting in a wide range of tuning circuits, colour controllers
and video-text controllers.</p><p>Nowadays several micro-controller families are also on the
market offering direct I2C-bus support, with A/D-D/A converters,
power switches, electronic potentiometers and LCD-display drivers.
These micro-controllers allow the connection of slower peripherals
to the bus.</p><p>I2C bus-controlled ICs are also available for
telecommunication services ranging from pagers to GSM telephones.
Using these services would make it easy to start actions via a
pager call to your computer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee4580.0x1fdc818"></a>Putting the I2C Bus and Linux Together</h2></div></div><p>When I started to experiment with the I2C bus, I had to build
an adapter for my PC. The simplest solution to connect them
involved a TTL chip and several resistors. This adaptor occupies my
second parallel port and has served me well for a long time.</p><p>In essence, transmission of data is accomplished by control
of the states of the lines. This type of device is also common to
many types of commercial products, such as TV-cards with teletext
receivers.</p><p>More sophisticated solutions involve a dedicated adapter
chip, called the PCF 8584. This chip implements most of the needed
protocol, and offers some nice extras, like interrupt generation,
bus monitoring and a long distance mode.</p><p>Originally, I supported only my own adapter, but I am
currently implementing drivers for others.</p><p>Controlling the bus via Linux is simple. As usual with
character devices, you have only to open the device file, set the
slave address (via an ioctl call) and read or write data. Depending
on the adapter, you can set different options.</p><p>If you don't like C, I have written a little extension to
Tcl/Tk which gives direct control over the I2C bus, allowing a
comfortable way to visualize acquired information. The extension is
also a convenient interface to the bus for debugging.</p></div></div>
