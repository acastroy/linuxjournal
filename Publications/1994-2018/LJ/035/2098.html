up in arms during the past six months over the efforts on an
individual named William R. Della Croce, Jr. from the Boston area
to collect 10% royalties on sales from businesses marketing Linux
products. He bases his written demands on a US trademark which he
claims to hold on the name &ldquo;LINUX&rdquo; for a computer operating
system. He, in fact, holds such a registered trademark, based on
his claim made under penalty of perjury that he is the owner and
first user of the mark for operating systems, and that he was not
aware in 1994 or 1995 of any other person who might claim or be
using this name and mark for an operating system. This claim is
absurd on its face.
</p><p>A group of companies (Workgroup Solutions, Inc, a Colorado
corporation; Yggdrasil Computing, Inc., a California corporation;
Specialized Systems Consultants, Inc., doing business as
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, a Washington corporation; Linux
International, a New Hampshire unincoroprated association, and
Linus Torvalds, have retained an internationally known software
industry attorney, G. Gervaise Davis III, of the Davis &amp;
Schroeder law firm in Monterey, CA to seek cancellation of this
registration on the grounds that it is fraudulent and obtained
under false pretenses. Mr. Davis and his firm are handling the case
on a vastly reduced fee basis, because of their long standing
relationship with the U.S. software industry. Davis was the
original attorney for Gary Kildall and Digital Research of CP/M
fame in the 1980s.</p><p>A Petition to Cancel was in fact filed with the Trademark
Trial and Appeals Board in Washinton, DC. on November 27, 1996,
detailing the improper actions of Della Croce and setting out the
true facts with a number of exhibits and attachments. Mr. Davis
advises us that we can expect to have further steps taken by TTAB,
under their complex procedural rules over the next few months. TTAB
will first notify Della Croce of the filing and permit him time to
respond, then evidence can be collected and depositions taken, and
then the parties can file briefs and other responses. Often these
cases take more than a year to be resolved by a TTAB
decision.</p><p>All of our industry is fully aware that Linus Torvalds
developed Linux and that it has become one of the world's most
popular operating systems during the past six years. The
participants in this proceeding expect the TTAB to cancel the
registration, after hearing and seeing the massive evidence
demonstrating that Della Croce had no conceiveable legal basis for
his claim to the mark.</p><p>The petition itself is available on SSC's web site and Mr.
Davis' law firm at www.iplawyers.com. We urge that interested
persons read it, and distribute it and this message to all members
of the LINUX community so that they will be aware of what is being
done about this outrageous trademark claim. We will try to keep
everyone posted on developments in the case through user groups and
webpages.</p><p>We will continue to keep you updated on the happenings in
this action. Check out the Hot Linux News button at

From: torvalds@linux.cs.Helsinki.FI (Linus Torvalds)
Date: 1996/12/09
Organization: University of Helsinki
Newsgroups: comp.os.linux.announce
</pre><p>AP/STT. Helsinki, Dec 5th, 6:22 AM. For immediate release.
</p><p>In order to allay fears about the continuity of the Linux
project, Linus Torvalds together with his manager Tove Monni have
released &ldquo;Linus v2.0&rdquo;, affectionately known as &ldquo;Kernel
Hacker&mdash;The Next Generation&rdquo;.</p><p>Linux stock prices on Wall Street rose sharply after the
announcement; as one well-known analyst who wishes to remain
anonymous says&mdash;&ldquo;It shows a long-term commitment, and while we
expect a short-term decrease in productivity, we feel that this
solidifies the development in the long run&rdquo;.</p><p>Other analysts downplay the importance of the event, and
claim that just about anybody could have done it. &ldquo;I'm glad
somebody finally told them about the birds and the bees" one
sceptic comments cryptically. But even the skeptics agree that it
is an interesting turn of events.</p><p>Others bring up other issues with the new version&mdash;&ldquo;I'm
especially intrigued by the fact that the new version is female,
and look forward to seeing what the impact of that will be on
future development. Will <span   class="emphasis"><em>Red Hat Linux</em></span> change
to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pink Hat Linux</em></span>, for example?&rdquo;</p></div></div>
