    This month, we will examine the error log to see what
    it contains, look through several errors and how they appear
    in the error log, and finally consider some ways in which we can
    use the error log to make debugging easier.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x160f580.0x17073a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>As discussed in my last column
(<i  >LJ</i>, Issue 34, WWW section), debugging CGI
programs is often more difficult than debugging their non-CGI
counterparts, if only because our programs aren't interacting
directly with the user's terminal. We have only one chance to get
input from the user&mdash;when the program is invoked&mdash;and only one
chance to send a response back to the user&mdash;just before the program
terminates, in the HTML that our program creates.
</p><p>This difficulty is complicated further by the fact that
running CGI programs correctly requires that a number of other
items be in place. For example, you must set the permission bits
correctly, the web server must be configured to serve CGI programs
from your directory, and the correct version of Perl (if you are
using Perl for your CGI tasks) must be installed. None of this is
very difficult, and it's particularly uncomplicated when compared
with the full administration of a Unix system, but it's not quite
as simple as compiling and executing other, non-CGI
programs.</p><p>In the last article in this series, we looked at techniques
that you can use when things go wrong. But what happens when all of
the permissions and directories are set correctly and you still end
up getting a mysterious error on your browser?</p><p>The answer is that while web servers send a generic error
message back to the user's web browser, they also keep an &ldquo;error
log,&rdquo; a file into which information about each error is placed.
This month, we will examine the error log to see what it contains,
look through several errors and how they appear in the error log,
and finally consider some ways in which we can use the error log to
make debugging easier.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x160f580.0x1707608"></a>Why an Error Log?</h2></div></div><p>As Unix programmers are well aware, programs typically have
at their disposal three basic file descriptors: standard input
(stdin), standard output (stdout), and standard error
(stderr).</p><p>Standard input is typically associated with the user's
keyboard; when you are entering text in Emacs or similar program,
the program is probably collecting your keystrokes via stdin.
Standard output, by contrast, typically goes back to your
console&mdash;either the window into which you are typing or the entire
screen.</p><p>Standard error is normally sent to the user's console, and
thus is often confused with stdout. But the two are completely
separate and can be redirected to different places. You can see
this in action by trying the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ls *zz* &gt; zz-files
</pre><p>which, on my system, produces the following output on the
screen:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ls: *zz*: No such file or directory
</pre>


Since there aren't any files containing <b  >zz</b> in
their names, the file <b  >zz-files</b> is empty. This
error message is sent to stderr, which is kept on the screen, while
the (empty) list of files is sent to stdout, which we redirected to
the file named <b  >zz-files</b>.
</p><p>A CGI program still has access to stdin, stdout and stderr,
but these files are used somewhat differently as the program isn't
running on the user's console. For a CGI program, stdin reflects
the contents of an HTML form as submitted via the POST method.
Stdout, not surprisingly, is used to send a response, which is
typically not in HTML format, to the user. Finally, stderr is
redirected to the HTTP server's error log, which is usually kept
far away from visitors to the web site.</p><p>Therefore, if our program dies unexpectedly, error messages
are directed to the httpd error log rather than to our browser. On
the one hand, this is probably a good thing&mdash;after all, you
probably don't want the world at large to know the number and kind
of bugs found in your code. On the other hand, this means that you
need to look at a separate file, and that you need to log on to the
server computer before you can know exactly what has happened to
your program.</p><p>If you are renting space on a web server run by a web space
provider or Internet service provider&mdash;or more importantly, if you
are looking to rent space from such a provider&mdash;make sure that you
have access to these logs. You can certainly write and debug CGI
programs without access to the error log, but your life will be
infinitely more pleasant if you can get to it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x160f580.0x1707ad8"></a>Looking at the Log</h2></div></div><p>Each HTTP server logs information in a slightly different
way. In this column, I will describe the logs produced by Apache, a
server derived from NCSA httpd, which was written and distributed
by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). You
can get a copy of Apache, as well as documentation relating to this
excellent server, at http://www.apache.org/.</p><p>In my copy of Apache, the error messages are placed in the
file with one line per error. Error messages are in the
format:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[DayOfWeek Month Date Time Year] Message
</pre><p>Thus one possible entry in the error log would be:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[Mon Dec 2 16:05:50 1996] Coke machine needs refilling
</pre>


As you might have guessed, this means that the server recorded the
error at 4:05:50 P.M. on Monday, December 2, 1996.
</p><p>Your httpd probably records all sorts of things in the error
log that you probably wouldn't classify as errors. For example, my
system's error log contains the following error message:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[Tue Nov 5 17:03:48 1996] access to \
  /home/httpd/cgi-bin failed for ahad-haam, reason: \
  script not found or unable to stat
</pre><p>The above message means that the server wasn't able to find a
particular file on my web server. That's right&mdash;every time someone
points his web browser to your system and requests a document that
doesn't exist, an error message is recorded. This is actually a
useful thing to know, both for security reasons (since it might be
nice to learn if people are trying to grab sensitive files via your
web server) and in order to help users who often but mistakenly
request particular files. For example, if a particular file is
often requested under an incorrectly spelled name, you can set up
an alias or symbolic link on your system.
</p><p>As interesting and useful as an error log might be for system
administrators, network administrators and web masters, we are
going to concentrate on the error log's role when trying to debug
CGI programs. For example, try the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/local/bin/perl5 -w
  use strict;      # Check our syntax strictly
  use diagnostics; # Tell us how to fix mistakes
  use CGI;         # Import the CGI module
  # Create an instance of CGI
  my $query = new CGI;
  # Notice that we are *not* sending a MIME
  # header, which we should always remember
  # to do.
  # Begin the HTML
  print $query-&gt;start_html(-title =&gt;
        "Hello, world!)";
  # Print something fairly uninteresting
  print "&lt;P&gt;Hello, World Wide Web!&lt;/P&gt;\n";
  # End the HTML
  print $query-&gt;end_html();
</pre><p>The above program will work just fine if run from the command
line, since the only error is a missing MIME header, which is
necessary only for CGI programs. But if you try to run it from a
browser, you get the dreaded message:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Server Error. The server encountered an internal
error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.
</pre>


Not very useful for debugging your program, particularly since
running it from the command line revealed no obvious errors. How
can you discover what has gone wrong? By looking at the error log.
</p><p>On my system, the error log contains the following
entry:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[Mon Dec 2 17:32:04 1996] access to
/home/reuven/Text/Websmith/test-8.pl failed
for ahad-haam, reason: malformed header from script
</pre><p>Not only does Apache tell us that there was an error, and
that the program died, but it even presents the reason, which is
listed as &ldquo;malformed header from script&rdquo;. Not the most obvious
message for newcomers, but it tells you what you need to know,
namely that the header sent wasn't in the proper format and thus
caused an error.
</p><p>We can now fix the program and remove the error message by
sending a MIME header before anything else:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/local/bin/perl5 -w
  use strict;      # Check our syntax strictly
  use diagnostics; # Tell us how to fix mistakes
  use CGI;         # Import the CGI module
  # Create an instance of CGI
  my $query = new CGI;
  # Send the MIME header
  print $query-&gt;header("text/html");
  # Begin the HTML
  print $query-&gt;start_html(-title =&gt;
        "Hello, world!");
  # Print something fairly uninteresting
  print "&lt;P&gt;Hello, World Wide Web!&lt;/P&gt;\n";
  # End the HTML
  print $query-&gt;end_html();
</pre><p>Sure enough, the fixed program doesn't produce any new
messages in the error log.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x160f580.0x17081b8"></a>Premature Program Termination</h2></div></div><p>A typical idiom in Perl might be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
open(FILE, "$filename") ||
        die "Cannot open $filename";
</pre><p>The above line means that <b  >$filename</b> should
be opened for reading, and that the opened file should be accessed
via the descriptor named <b  >FILE</b>. If the program
cannot open the file for some reason the program should terminate,
producing a message. Let's look at how that works within a CGI
program:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/local/bin/perl5 -w
  use strict;      # Check our syntax strictly
  use diagnostics; # Tell us how to fix mistakes
  use CGI;         # Import the CGI module
  # Create an instance of CGI
  my $query = new CGI;
  # Set this to a file
  my $filename = "/foo/bar/blah.txt";
  # Send the MIME header
  print $query-&gt;header("text/html");
  # Begin the HTML
  print $query-&gt;start_html(-title =&gt;
        "Hello, world!");
  # Print the contents of $filename
  open (FILE, "$filename") ||
        die "Cannot open $filename ";
  print while (&lt;FILE&gt;);
  close (FILE);
  # End the HTML
  print $query-&gt;end_html();
</pre>


Looks good, right? Well, the above will indeed work just fine,
assuming that <b  >$filename</b> exists. But if and when
it doesn't, or if the program doesn't have permission to read the
file, the second half of the statement is executed&mdash;and the program
terminates, producing an error message.
</p><p>If <b  >$filename</b> doesn't exist, and you run
the program from the command line, you get the following
output:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Content-type: text/html
&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;Uncaught exception from user code:
Cannot open /tmp/blah.txt at ./test-8.pl line 20.
</pre><p>But if you run it from your web browser, you get nothing at
all&mdash;no error message, and no response, because the error message
&ldquo;<b  >Cannot open /tmp/blah.txt</b>&rdquo; was sent to
stderr, rather than stdout. The error log, however, contains the
following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Uncaught exception from user code:
Cannot open /tmp/blah.txt at /home/reuven/Text/Websmith/test-8.pl line 20.
</pre>


Note that the error message is inserted into the log without date
or time information, since the text was sent directly by the Perl
program (or by the Perl binary), rather than the web server. The
web server automatically stamps its own error messages with the
current time and date, but your programs don't enjoy that
feature&mdash;unless, of course, you include the
<span   class="bold"><b>Carp</b></span> library included with
<span   class="bold"><b>CGI.pm</b></span>, which redefines the
<b  >die</b> routine, as well as several others, such
that error messages are preceded by the relevant time and date.
Thus, if you include the line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
use CGI::Carp;
</pre>


at the top of the above program, the program still fails as
expected, but your error log now contains the following entry:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[Tue Dec 3 11:55:14 1996] test-8.pl:
Cannot open /tmp/blah.txt at
/home/reuven/Text/Websmith/test-8.pl line 21.
</pre>


Now we know not only what went wrong, but also when it happened.
The Carp library can be very useful when debugging CGI programs,
especially if you find yourself running the same program
repeatedly. This way, there isn't any question whether the error
occurred the first or fifth time that you ran the program, since
the time at which the program ran is written right next to the
error message.
</p><p>Once you have installed Carp, you can use it for recording
non-fatal errors, as well. For example, if you are trying to keep
track of the value of a particular variable, you can include the
line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
carp 'variablename = "'. $variablename . '"';
</pre><p>Because it includes the time and date information, this is
better than:
<pre     class="programlisting">
print STDERR 'variablename = "', $variablename,
        '"';
</pre>


Although using Perl's built-in syntax checkers and warnings (with
the <b  >-w</b> flag and the
<span   class="bold"><b>strict</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>diagnostics</b></span> modules) is a great
idea, realize that loading the <b  >CGI::Carp</b> module
will set off warning bells because it redefines several
subroutines. You can ignore these warnings, but don't be surprised
when they appear.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x160f580.0x1708b58"></a>What About the User?</h2></div></div><p>All this time, we have ignored our users, who are really
supposed to be the focus of our efforts. It's all well and good
that we are improving error messages for the purpose of debugging
programs, but none of the ideas that we have looked at until now
have done much for what the user sees.</p><p>The problem is that if you use <b  >die</b> to
output a message to the error log, the program dies off before it
has a chance to produce any sort of &ldquo;whoops&rdquo; message for the
user. If you're building an interactive web site, the last thing
you want to do is present a user with a blank results page; at the
very least, you should tell him that something has gone wrong, and
that you are trying to fix the problem.</p><p>One easy way to do this is to replace the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
open (FILE, "$filename") ||
        die "Cannot open $filename ";
</pre><p>with the following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
open (FILE, "$filename") ||
        &amp;log_and_die ("Cannot open $filename ");
</pre>


This new version opens the file as necessary, but invokes a
subroutine named <b  >log_and_die</b>, if the file cannot
be opened. You can then define the subroutine as follows:
<pre     class="programlisting">
sub log_and_die
  {
        # Get arguments
        my $string = shift;
        # Begin the HTML
        print $query-&gt;start_html(-title =&gt; "Error");
        # Give a message
        print "&lt;P&gt;Sorry, but this program ";
        print "has encountered an error. The system ";
        print "administrator has been ";
        print "informed.&lt;/P&gt;\n";
        print "&lt;P&gt;Would you like to return to the;
        print "&lt;a href=\"/\"&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt;?\n";
        # End the HTML
        print $query-&gt;end_html();
    # Now die with the error message
    die $string;
  }
</pre>


The above routine is obviously a bit Spartan for most tastes, but
the point is obvious: By wrapping errors into a separate routine,
you can have our cake and eat it, too. The user gets an error
message directing him or her to another site, and apologizing
profusely for the program's errors. And the system administrator or
web master gets a note in the error log describing exactly what
went wrong, making it possible to fix the program more easily.
</p><p>You could obviously add to this routine. For starters, a good
idea might be to e-mail the system administrator or programmer to
let him or her know that an error had occurred. If the program were
part of a critical system, then perhaps it would even be a good
idea to send e-mail to a system tied into an alphanumeric paging
system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x160f580.0x16ff808"></a>Sending MIME Headers First</h2></div></div><p>In all of the above examples, we call <b  >die</b>
only after having already sent the MIME header to the browser (with
the built-in CGI.pm &ldquo;header&rdquo; method). Failing to do so can create
all sorts of odd problems, and results in the dreaded
message:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Server Error. The server encountered an internal
error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.
</pre><p>For example, running the following CGI program:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/local/bin/perl5 -w
  use strict;      # Check our syntax strictly
  use diagnostics; # Tell us how to fix mistakes
  use CGI;         # Import the CGI module
  use CGI::Carp;
  # Create an instance of CGI
  my $query = new CGI;
  # Don't do very much
  die "This program crashed on purpose ";
</pre>


The above program dies upon reaching the last line, and inserts an
appropriate message into the httpd error log. What will the user
see on his or her browser? In the above example, the user will get
the dreaded:
<pre     class="programlisting">
The server encountered an internal error or
misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.
</pre>


You can alleviate this problem by sending a MIME header before
performing any serious computations:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/local/bin/perl5 -w
  use strict;      # Check our syntax strictly
  use diagnostics; # Tell us how to fix mistakes
  use CGI;         # Import the CGI module
  use CGI::Carp;
  # Create an instance of CGI
  my $query = new CGI;
  print $query-&gt;header("text/html");
  # Don't do very much
  die "This program crashed on purpose ";
</pre>


Note: while the documentation for CGI::Carp claims to alleviate
this problem, experiments with the version installed on my system
(from early September 1996) didn't seem to work quite this way. I
thus suggest that you output MIME headers as close to the beginning
of your programs as possible, simply to alleviate such problems.
</p><p>Despite the colorful language that might occur to you when
your program produces an error message, good warnings and logs are
extremely helpful when writing and debugging code. This is
especially true for CGI programs, where much of the work takes
place behind the scenes and the only output to the user comes via a
web browser. Learn to use the httpd error log effectively, and
while your programming problems certainly won't disappear, your
mistakes should be easier to identify and correct.</p></div></div>
