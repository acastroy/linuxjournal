    By the time you read this, the SCO in &ldquo;SCO Xenix&rdquo; will
    stand for &ldquo;Software Considered Obsolete&rdquo;. Is there an
    opportunity here?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcb0580.0xda83f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>As of January 1, 1996 the Santa Cruz
Operation (SCO) streamlined its product offerings by dropping a
number of older releases from its lineup. Until last December 31,
you could still buy OpenServer 3.0 even as version 5.0.2 neared
release; not any more.
</p><p>While few will mourn the passing of most of SCO's 1997 New
Year's obsolescence list, I know of at least a few old comrades who
will light a virtual candle or two for venerable SCO Xenix, that
throwback to the time when Microsoft was a Unix OEM.</p><p>Ah, Xenix... My first taste of it was in mid-1985, when it
was just about the only thing with genuine Unix code you could get
to run on the 286s and 386s of the day. I wasn't at a college where
I could play with BSD-filled VAXes, I couldn't afford the
68000-based offerings of the day from Sun and HP, and I didn't feel
comfortable with the wide assortment of available Unix clones such
as Coherent or QNX or OS9.</p><p>In the years that have passed, much has changed; Unix has
changed hands many times, DEC and IBM discovered Unix (thus giving
us the OSF and the Unix Wars), CPUs have become both more complex
and more simple (i.e., RISC), and hardware such as accelerated
video and CD-ROMs are commonplace. Until December, though, the one
constant was Xenix.</p><p>Now before you check the cover of this magazine to wonder why
you're reading so much about SCO stuff in a Linux magazine, please
understand that the death of Xenix has great significance to the
Linux community. It represents a major opportunity for Linux
supporters to make inroads into the world of business computing. It
presents us with opportunities to not only make money, but also to
build the reputation of Linux as a stable platform more than
capable of running a business.</p><p>While Xenix may be going away, the reason it existed for so
long won't. Xenix serves as a workhorse for small
businesses&mdash;places where you might find a dozen or so dumb
terminals and a couple of printers plugged into a system running
FoxBase or other small database system. It's simple, small and
stable, maintaining such anachronisms in the current Unix market as
unlimited-user licenses and command-line administration.</p><p>Despite the appeal of GUIs, the simplicity of a command-line
interface still holds an attraction for many people running small
businesses. While metaphorical desktops are being moved to PCs as
the dumb terminals break down, basic database tasks are still
handled more than adequately by Xenix running on minimal hardware.
Who needs the bloat of the X Window System on a database server
anyway?</p><p>Most Xenix users will probably continue to use their systems
as-is until they break, exemplifying the &ldquo;if it ain't broke don't
fix it&rdquo; school of computer administration. But when these systems
<span   class="bold"><b>do</b></span> break, Xenix will no longer be
suitable.</p><p>For one thing, Xenix doesn't take to new hardware easily.
CD-ROMs, PCI, and even mice are difficult or impossible to
implement in Xenix; it just barely supports SCSI disks and tapes.
Xenix's networking support, while never very functional, no longer
exists as an upgrade in any case&mdash;someone wanting to add even a
single Xenix box to telnet or share services is out of luck.</p><p>This is where Linux comes in. It makes a perfect drop-in
replacement for Xenix; it also runs lean and acceptably fast even
on slow &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; hardware, and it supports inexpensive
peripherals very well. Furthermore, Xenix adds several new features
small businesses now expect from their systems.</p><p>Most businesses have probably grown out of the kind of word
processors that had been available on Xenix (ASCII-based
WordPefect5; Lyrix; even Uniplex&mdash;argh!). At the very least,
they've become jealous of what they've seen on PCs; even if they
love the way their Unix databases are working, most want to move
their word processing and spreadsheet applications onto GUI
systems.</p><p>If you can talk users into considering Linux, running
Caldera's Internet Office Suite or Red Hat's Applixware or even
StarOffice, so much the better! But even if not, you'll know their
new Linux server will be able to run more than just databases. They
can use Samba to enable file and printer sharing, and all the tools
are there if they want to set up an Intranet or Internet
access.</p><p>SCO's answer to stranded Xenix users is to offer one of a
number of upgrade schemes to OpenServer Release 5:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Xenix to 16-user Host system (no networking):
$250</p></li><li><p>Xenix to 32-user Enterprise system (with
networking): $750</p></li></ul></div><p>Many Xenix users may be uncomfortable upgrading their
unlimited-users license to a limited-user OpenServer system, or
paying about $4,000 to upgrade to an unlimited-user OpenServer.
Anyone wanting to upgrade a Xenix development system will pay an
additional $300. Also, OpenServer systems need more RAM and better
video than Xenix does to do the same job.</p><p>Compare this to the cost of the most expensive Linux
distribution. To be sure, there are a few technical quirks going
from Xenix to Linux (Linux doesn't have SCO's &ldquo;custom&rdquo;
installation software, for instance) but these aren't a big problem
for Linux installers. Running Xenix binaries has not been a problem
for me, at least.</p><p>This means that Xenix can be the second big opportunity for
Linux systems to make their way into business computing. If the
Internet got Linux a foot in the door of corporate computing,
upgrading Xenix installations would be like getting in an entire
leg and maybe an arm as well.</p><p>Of course, all the cost savings in the world won't help if
the customer doesn't believe Linux is reliable enough to be as
low-maintenance as the Xenix it replaces. There's a common
perception within the SCO community (at least, based on the
newsgroups) that Linux still isn't robust enough for commercial
use. Part of this perception is pure FUD, some is based on
experience from people who tried Unix in the BC era (before
Caldera), when Linux really wasn't being aimed at the commercial
world.</p><p>Now that Linux is starting to approach the turf of commercial
Unix vendors (not just SCO), the road is going to get rougher.
Here's where we leave the realm of computer religion and enter the
free market. If something you do or say is going to lose someone a
sale and associated commission and profit, they're not going to put
up with this quietly. Newsgroup flames are nothing compared to the
vulgarities of salesmanship; it's amazing what some people will do
to reach their sales quotas.</p><p>Until now, putting Linux into a company has rarely been at
the direct expense of some other vendor; it's come in as an
auxiliary system to do routing, run the Internet connection, or
maybe serve as a power user's desktop system. Now with the release
of industrial-strength software for Linux such as the ADABAS
database, Linux has a legitimate shot at becoming the core for
central servers in business. As it succeeds, and as other Unix
vendors start to (publicly) take Linux seriously as a competitor, a
lot of mud (and FUD) will be flung our way.</p><p>The answer to flung mud is not Amiga-style evangelism, but
cold hard fact&mdash;case studies, comparative analyses and companies
such as Caldera and Red Hat and Crynwr prepared to support
freeware-based products. The increasing volume of good coverage
Linux is getting in the business computing press helps, too.</p><p>To be sure, more is needed. The Linux community
<span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> agree upon a single software installation
and management scheme, just as it standardized file system layouts.
As Linux further finds its way into commercial settings, it'll need
appropriate features (provided as freeware or commercial software)
such as on-line data managers and better RAID facilities. More ISVs
need to be encouraged to support Linux; and as they do, they, in
turn, need to be supported.</p><p>Is the community up to the challenge? I'm betting on it. In
the meantime, keep an eye on all those Xenix systems out there. The
time will come.</p></div></div>
