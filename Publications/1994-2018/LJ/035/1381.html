    Perl 5 includes packages enabling your Perl scripts to create
    and
    modify databases in standard Unix formats. One of these databases can be
    a
    more efficient alternative than a flat text file (which Perl handles
    marvelously), and it will be compatible with other languages, like C.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27de580.0x28d64a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Perl programmers, like programmers of any
other language, typically need to store large amounts of data. For
this data to be manageable, it needs to be stored in a conveniently
accessible format. It never hurts to make the stored data easy to
write, as well.
</p><p>Even though Perl is an exceptional language for text
processing, in many circumstances, a more structured database-like
format offers quicker access. In addition, it may also be necessary
for a Perl script to read or write a database that is also accessed
through a C program.</p><p>To accomplish this, the Perl distribution includes packages
that give a Perl programmer access to a variety of different
database formats available in a Unix environment. These formats
include: the Berkeley DB format, the Free Software Foundation's
GDBM format and the NDBM format.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27de580.0x28d6660"></a>Associative Arrays</h2></div></div><p>The associative array (or &ldquo;hash&rdquo;) is one of the most
powerful data structures available to a Perl programmer. To those
familiar with traditional arrays (in C, Pascal or Perl), an
associative array can be thought of as an array indexed using an
arbitrary string instead of an integer subscript. Basically, an
associative array is a data structure that allows the programmer to
associate one string&mdash;a key&mdash;with another&mdash;its value.</p><p>Here is an example of an associative array that can be used
to convert the abbreviated name of a day of the week to its full
name.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
%days = (
        "Sun", "Sunday",
        "Mon", "Monday",
        "Tue", "Tuesday",
        "Wed", "Wednesday",
        "Thu", "Thursday",
        "Fri", "Friday",
        "Sat", "Saturday"
);
</pre><p>The <b  >%</b> in front of the variable name
<b  >days</b> is used to tell Perl the variable is an
associative array. As shown, associative arrays are initialized by
using pairs of values that relate to each other.
</p><p>To access the data stored in an associative array, you can
use a syntax similar to the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$long_name = $days{"Sun"};
</pre><p>This expression will set the scalar variable
<b  >long_name</b> to the value associated with the key
&ldquo;Sun&rdquo;, the string &ldquo;Sunday&rdquo; in this example.
</p><p>You can see already that associative arrays can be a powerful
tool for organizing data used inside of a Perl script. This
technique can easily be extended to something more useful by
creating <span   class="emphasis"><em>values</em></span> made up of more than one
field. Take, for instance, this simple address book database where
multiple fields in the associative array's value are separated by
colons:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$phone_db = (
        "Bill Jones", "123 West Avenue:New York, NY:12345",
        "Jane Smith", "6789 1st Street:Chicago, IL:56789"
);
</pre><p>New entries in this database can be added with an expression
like:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$phone_db{"Bill Smith"} = join(":", $street, $city, $zip_code);
</pre>


Data can be extracted from this simple database with an expression
like:
<pre     class="programlisting">
($street, $city, $zip_code) = split(/:/, $phone_db{"Bill Smith"});
</pre>


As you can see, these arrays come in very handy for manipulating
data inside a Perl script. However, how can we export this data
easily to a file so our scripts or other programs can access the
data? One simple method would be to use a text file with the fields
of our database separated by colons. This method would make writing
out the database from our Perl script very simple. It could be done
using a piece of code like the following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
while (($name, $record) = each %phone_db) {
        print "$name:$record\n";
}
</pre>


This method does not lend itself well to performing a search
through the file, as we would need to read, on average, half the
lines in the file in order to find the record we are seeking. In
addition, writing code to search such a file in other languages (C,
for instance) may not be as simple as the Perl script we have
written.
</p><p>To solve this problem, Perl supports &ldquo;binding&rdquo; associative
arrays to the various types of database formats mentioned above.
This allows a Perl programmer to create, access and update
databases in the popular Unix database formats as easily as
performing operations on an associative array.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27de580.0x28d6d40"></a>Database Support in Perl</h2></div></div><p>Perl version 5 includes a set of &ldquo;packages&rdquo; that manipulate
the various database formats. These packages are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>DB_File&mdash;for Berkeley DB databases</p></li><li><p>GDBM_File&mdash;for the Free Software Foundation's GDBM
databases</p></li><li><p>NDBM_File</p></li><li><p>ODBM_File</p></li><li><p>SDBM_File</p></li></ul></div><p>To use any of these database packages, a Perl programmer must
<span   class="emphasis"><em>include</em></span> the package at the beginning of the
script using the following statement:
<pre     class="programlisting">
use DB_File;
</pre>


In addition, the Fcntl package also needs to be included. This is
accomplished by including the following at the beginning of the
script:
<pre     class="programlisting">
use Fcntl;
</pre>


Man pages are included in the Perl distribution for each of these
packages. For simplicity's sake, only the DB_File package and its
associated Berkeley DB databases are discussed in this article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27de580.0x28d7370"></a>Opening a Database</h2></div></div><p>Databases are opened in Perl using the
<b  >tie()</b> function. This function is responsible for
&ldquo;joining&rdquo; an associative array with a database package.
Operations performed on the associative array are then translated
by the database package into function calls that operate on the
database file itself.</p><p>Here is an example of opening a database named &ldquo;phone.db&rdquo;
using the DB_File database package:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tie (%phone_db, DB_File, "phone.db") ||
        die ("Cannot open phone.db");
</pre><p>This command binds the associative array named
<b  >phone_db</b> to the Berkeley DB database file named
&ldquo;phone.db&rdquo;. In this example, the file must exist and must be
readable by the Perl script.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27de580.0x28d7630"></a>Creating a Database</h2></div></div><p>Creating a database is nearly as simple as opening one. The
following command will create a database named &ldquo;phone.db&rdquo; in the
current directory with the file's permissions set to read-write for
the owner and read-only for everyone else. The file will be created
only if it does not already exist. If the database file exists in
the current directory, the database file will simply be opened for
read-write access by the Perl script.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tie (%phone_db, DB_File, "phone.db", O_CREAT|O_RDWR, 0644) ||
        die ("Cannot create or open phone.db");
</pre><p>The <b  >O_CREAT</b> and <b  >O_RDWR</b>
flags are the same flags used as parameters to the Unix
<b  >open()</b> system call. They specify that the file
should be created if it does not exist and opened with read-write
access.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27de580.0x28d78f0"></a>Reading from the Database</h2></div></div><p>Reading from the database works exactly like reading data
from an associative array. If the key is known, specific records
can be read from the file with an expression like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$record = $phone_db{"Bill Smith"};
</pre><p>All the records in the database file can be scanned (in a
seemingly random order) with something like:
<pre     class="programlisting">
while (($name, $record) = each %phone_db) {
        [ commands to process data here ]
}
</pre>


During each pass through the <b  >while</b> loop, the
<b  >$name</b> scalar variable will be set to the key
value from the database, and the <b  >$record</b>
variable will be set to the data associated with the key.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27de580.0x28d7c08"></a>Writing to the Database</h2></div></div><p>New data can be written into the database by creating a new
key in the associative array and setting the key's value. This is
done with a command similar to:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$phone_db{"Bill Smith"} = $data;
</pre><p>where <b  >$data</b> is the information to be
associated with the key &ldquo;Bill Smith&rdquo;. Any changes made to the
associative array will be written into its corresponding database
file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27de580.0x2cd0068"></a>Deleting Items from the Database</h2></div></div><p>Keys can be removed from the database in exactly the same way
items are removed from an associative array in Perl&mdash;by using the
<b  >delete()</b> function. The following code removes
the record in the database that refers to &ldquo;Bill Smith&rdquo;.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
delete $phone_db{"Bill Smith"};
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27de580.0x2cd0220"></a>Closing the Database File</h2></div></div><p>Changes to an associative array may not be immediately
written out to the database file. To insure that changes are
successfully written to the database file, the file must be
closed.</p><p>Closing the database file involves
<span   class="emphasis"><em>un-binding</em></span> the associative array from the
database package. This is done with the <b  >untie()</b>
function in the following manner:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
untie(%phone_db);
</pre><p>This closes the database file, making updates to the file if
necessary. The associative array <b  >%phone_db</b> can
now no longer be used to access the records in the database.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27de580.0x2cd0538"></a>Other Types of Databases</h2></div></div><p>All of the examples provided here use the default type of
Berkeley DB database, the <b  >DB_HASH</b> type. This
form of database uses a hash table (like Perl does) to store the
keys and their values in the database file. Two other types of
databases are provided with the Berkeley DB package:
<b  >DB_BTREE</b> and <b  >DB_RECNO</b>.</p><p>The <b  >DB_BTREE</b> format uses a sorted,
balanced binary tree to store the key and value pairs. This format
allows data to be stored and read in a sorted order as opposed to
the seemingly random order the <b  >DB_HASH</b> format
produces. The default comparison routine sorts the keys in the
database file in lexical order (alphabetically). The DB_File man
page discusses this format in more detail and shows how to replace
the default comparison routine with one of your own.</p><p>The <b  >DB_RECNO</b> format is designed to operate
on flat text files. It is bound (with <b  >tie()</b>) to
normal Perl arrays, not associative arrays. Indexing this array
with a number provides the text found on that line of the database
file. This format is also discussed in more detail in the DB_File
man page.</p><p>The desired format of database file is specified with an
additional parameter for the <b  >tie</b>()
function.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tie (%phone_db, DB_File, "phone.db", O_RDONLY, 0644, $DB_BTREE) ||
                die ("Cannot open phone.db");
</pre><p>This command will open the <b  >DB_BTREE</b>
database named &ldquo;phone.db&rdquo; in read-only access mode. If the file
does not exist, the command fails.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27de580.0x2cd0b10"></a>Other Fun Stuff with Associative Arrays</h2></div></div><p>Sometimes it is necessary to sort an associative array within
a Perl script. Sorting by the key values of an associative array is
done like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
for (sort keys %phone_db) {
        print "$_ = $phone_db{$_}\n";
}
</pre><p>Each iteration of this loop will set the
<b  >$_</b> scalar to a key value from the associative
array provided in alphabetical order. This method works very nicely
for sorting associative arrays by their keys. Sorting by an
associative array's values is slightly more difficult:
<pre     class="programlisting">
sub sort_by_value {
        ( $phone_db{$a} cmp $phone_db{$b} ) || \
( $a cmp $b );
}
for (sort sort_by_value keys %phone_db) {
        print "$_ = $phone_db{$_}\n";
}
</pre>


This piece of code substitutes the default routine that
<b  >sort()</b> uses to order the elements it is given
with a special routine. This routine,
<b  >sort_by_value</b>, sorts the associative array first
by the values, and secondly by the keys (i.e., when the two values
are identical, compare their respective keys to determine which
should appear first).
</p><p>Keep in mind that these two methods for sorting an
associative array do not actually rearrange the array in any
fashion. They simply provide a way to pull every key and value pair
from an associative array in a particular sorted order.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27de580.0x2cd0e80"></a>Putting It All Together</h2></div></div><p>An example of how databases in Perl can be used is provided
in Listing 1, a short script designed to keep a database of hits on
a World Wide Web site. The script reads the NCSA HTTPD
<span   class="emphasis"><em>access</em></span> log file, stores the information in the
database and creates an HTML page that displays all the statistics
for the site.</p><p><a href="1381l1.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing 1.
Example Web Site Hits Database Script</b></span></a></p><p>This implementation is not complete&mdash;it keeps track only of
which documents were accessed and their sizes. A more complete
implementation could also store information about the hosts that
accessed the web server, for instance. Some method for &ldquo;expiring&rdquo;
entries in the database after a particular time interval would be a
handy feature as well.</p><p>The script begins by reading the existing database file and
placing all the data into associative arrays indexed by the
document file name. Next, the script reads the access log file from
standard input and places the data into the associative arrays that
store the statistics. Finally, the script creates an HTML page
using tables to display the statistics.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27de580.0x2cd1198"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The topics provided in this article are by no means a

included with Perl, but they can be used as a starting point for
