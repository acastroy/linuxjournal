    One of the many features of Perl is its ability to use sockets,
    which are a mechanism of interprocess communication and the basis for
    most Internet clients and servers. This article introduces using
    sockets and Perl with a simple client program.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28da580.0x29d23a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Perl works well for writing prototypes or
full-fledged applications because it is so complete. The language
seldom needs to be extended to do the sorts of things you'd expect
to do with C or C++ on a Linux system. One notable example is the
Berkeley socket functions, which Perl included even back when the
Internet was just a cool bit of technology rather than a global
cultural phenomenon.
</p><p>Sockets are a general-purpose inter-process communication
(IPC) mechanism. When processes run on separate machines, they can
employ sockets to communicate using Internet protocols. This is the
basis for most Internet clients and servers. Many Internet
protocols are based on exchanging simple text; so is much of the
interesting content. Since Perl excels at processing text, it's
ideal for writing applications like web servers or any type of
client which parses or searches for text. In this article, we
develop a very simple client that searches for regular expressions
on specified web sites&mdash;a not-so-intelligent agent, you might
say.</p><p>I assume the reader has no prior knowledge of sockets, but if
you have used the socket functions in C, they'll look quite
familiar in Perl. The basic functions include <b  >socket,
connect, bind, listen,</b> and <b  >accept</b>.
Perl also has versions of functions like
<b  >gethostbyname</b> and
<b  >getprotobyname</b>, which make socket communication
much easier. These Perl functions, of course, eventually invoke the
C versions, so the argument lists are quite similar. The only
differences arise because Perl file handles aren't the same as C
file descriptors (which are just integers) and the Perl versions
don't need the additional lengthy arguments for strings or
structures.</p><p>We'll discuss the details of the socket functions needed for
an Internet client later, but let's first look briefly at the
normal sequence of operations for Internet communication. The
server first establishes a socket with the
<b  >socket</b> function, which returns a socket
descriptor much like a file descriptor. The server next assigns the
socket an address with <b  >bind</b>, then tells the
system that it is willing to receive connections with the
<b  >listen</b> function. The <b  >accept</b>
function can block until a client connects to the server. The
client program also calls <b  >socket</b> and gets a
socket descriptor. The client connects to the address specified by
the server's <b  >bind</b> call using the
<b  >connect</b> function. If all goes well, the client
can read and write to the socket descriptor just as if it were a
file descriptor. Refer to Listing 2 to see how the
<b  >socket</b> and <b  >connect</b> functions
are used in a typical program.</p><p>As mentioned above, a client program must first call
<b  >socket</b> to get a socket descriptor or, in the
case of Perl, a file handle. This function specifies a particular
communications protocol to use and sets up an endpoint for
communication&mdash;that is, a place to plug in a connection&mdash;a
&ldquo;socket&rdquo;, for lack of a better term. The syntax of this function
is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
socket SOCKET, DOMAIN, TYPE, PROTOCOL
</pre><p><b  >SOCKET</b> is the file handle.
<b  >DOMAIN</b> and <b  >TYPE</b> are integers
that specify the address domain (or family) and the socket type. In
Perl 4, you had to set these numbers explicitly, but Perl 5 defines
them in the Socket module. To access the Socket module, add the
following line to the top of your program:
<pre     class="programlisting">
use Socket;
</pre>


For Internet applications, set <b  >DOMAIN</b> to
<b  >AF_INET</b> (usually 2) and <b  >TYPE</b>
to <b  >SOCK_STREAM</b> (usually 1). This basically means
the address of the server will have the familiar Internet form
(e.g., 192.42.55.55) and you'll read from and write to the socket
like any I/O stream. You can set the <b  >PROTOCOL</b>
argument to 0 for most applications, but it's easy to get the
correct value with the <b  >getprotobyname</b> function.
</p><p>Next, you need to connect to the server with the
<b  >connect</b> function. This can get a bit tricky in
Perl if you don't have the most recent versions of the Socket
module, primarily because it's hard to specify the server's
address. The syntax of the <b  >connect</b> function
is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
connect SOCKET, NAME
</pre><p><b  >SOCKET</b> is the file handle created by the
<b  >socket</b> function, so that's easy. The
<b  >NAME</b> argument, however, is described as a
&ldquo;packed network address of the proper type for the socket&rdquo;, which
might leave you scratching your head if you're not already familiar
with sockets. For Internet applications, the proper type of network
address for the C version of the <b  >connect</b>
function is given by structures something like those in Listing 1
(from either <b  >&lt;netinet/in.h&gt;</b> or
<b  >&lt;linux/in.h&gt;</b>).
</p><p><a href="2057l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>With a bit of scrutiny, you can see you need to pack three
pieces of information into a binary structure 16 bytes long. First
you need the address family, which is <b  >AF_INET</b>,
the same as the <b  >DOMAIN</b> argument to
<b  >socket</b>. The second piece is the port number of
the server socket. Most common servers have what's called a
&ldquo;well-known&rdquo; port number (in the case of HTTP servers, this is
80), but an application should have some method of indicating
alternate port numbers. Finally, you need to know the Internet
address of the server. From the structures above, you can tell this
is a 32-bit value. Fortunately, if you know the Internet name of
the server (e.g., www.linux.com) you can get the address with the
<b  >gethostbyname</b> function. Once you've assembled
this information, you can create the <b  >NAME</b>
argument with the Perl <b  >pack</b> function. The code
might look something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$sockaddr_in = 'S n a4 x8';
$in_addr = (gethostbyname("www.linux.com"))[4];
$server_addr = pack( $sockaddr_in, AF_INET, 80, $in_addr );
</pre><p>Recent versions of Perl (5.002 and later) greatly simplify
this whole process with the <b  >sockaddr_in</b> function
from the Socket module. This function takes the port number and the
Internet address of the server and returns the appropriate packed
structure. I use this technique in our mini-client in Listing 2. If
you need portability, or simply want readability, I strongly
recommend using Perl version 5.002 or later.
</p><p><a href="2057l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>So we've finally set up our socket and made a connection to
the server. Now things get considerably easier because we can treat
the socket like any other file handle. The only wrinkle is we want
to make sure anything we write to the socket is not buffered,
because it needs to get to the server before we can read the
server's response. For this we use the Perl
<b  >select</b> function, which sets the file handle to
use for standard output. Note in Listing 2 that the socket file
handle is selected; then the special variable <b  >$|</b>
is set to 1 to force a buffer flush after every write; then
<b  >STDOUT</b> is re-selected.</p><p>Now our client can send a request to the server. This
application just sends a GET command to the HTTP server so that it
will return the page specified by the URL. Once the command is
sent, we read anything arriving at the socket line-by-line and look
for the patterns we've specified. You could do anything you wanted
with the HTML returned from the server, even parsing it or looking
for other hypertext links to follow.</p><p>It will come as no shock that there are many aspects of
sockets we haven't covered. In particular, I haven't discussed
writing servers (mainly to keep this article to a manageable
length). If you want to learn more about writing Internet servers
in Perl, I recommend reading <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming Perl</em></span>
by Wall, Christiansen, and Schwarz (commonly called &ldquo;the Camel
book&rdquo;). Perl also contains several socket functions I haven't
mentioned, including <b  >send</b> and
<b  >recv</b>, that can be used like write and read
calls, and <b  >sendto</b> and
<b  >recvfrom</b>, which are used for so-called
&ldquo;connectionless&rdquo; communications. Again, see the Camel book for
details on these functions, and for network communication in
general, I recommend <span   class="emphasis"><em>Unix Network Programming</em></span>
by W. Richard Stevens. Also, don't forget that many Perl Internet
applications live out there on the Internet already, so look to
these for examples. I particularly recommend tinyhttpd, a very
compact HTTP server, as a good way to learn how to construct
servers (see http://www.inka.de/~bigred/sw/tinyhttpd.html).</p></div></div>
