updated to cover Perl 5, of &ldquo;The Camel Book&rdquo;--the one with a
camel on the cover.</p><p>This book is not a tutorial. If Perl is your first
programming language, you will most likely want to start somewhere
else&mdash;this book could lead to hopeless confusion.</p><p>Rather than the newbie, this book is intended for someone who
is at least very familiar with Unix utilities, such as awk and sed,
and even better, someone with a language such as C under his belt.
In fact, C programmers will see similarities between this book and
&ldquo;K &amp; R&rdquo;.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Perl Programming</em></span> begins with an overview
of basic concepts. After that, get ready for serious work. The
second chapter, titled &ldquo;The Gory Details&rdquo;, is exactly that&mdash;it
covers the whole language in about 100 pages.</p><p>The next chapter, which is also about 100 pages, describes
the functions available to the Perl programmer. C programmers would
think of this as the library. Included for each function is its
name, its arguments and a textual description of what it does along
with appropriate examples.</p><p>The Perl language primarily deals in simple, flat data
structures, but this approach doesn't work in every case. Chapter
Four describes how to deal with more complicated data by using
references and nested data structures.</p><p>At this point, less than half way through the book, you have
seen all of the language and all the built-in functions. However,
if you want to become a truly proficient Perl programmer, there's a
lot more to learn; e.g., how to produce good modular code. The book
therefore goes on to cover modules and packages as well as
interaction with the shell and other languages. This section sets
the groundwork for the standard Perl library, which is a set of
Perl code included with each Perl distribution, the subject of
discussion for 150 pages of the book.</p><p>The final two chapters cover debugging and error messages. In
addition to how to use the debugger, common mistakes, efficiency
and style are covered.</p><p>Let me note the humor content&mdash;a surprising feature in what
should be a dry technical manual on a language&mdash;which is generally
manifest in explanations of some obtuse detail or presentation of
background information. While some might find this distracting, I
found it a pleasant diversion from a lot of otherwise necessarily
dry material. If a humorous bit is long, it is generally in a
footnote that can easily be skipped. My only criticism of this book
is that it seems to make Perl seem more complicated than it is. It
is hard to put my finger on exactly why I feel this way, but
perhaps it is because the book tends to tell you everything about a
particular command or capability at once. This is just how the book
is organized, and it makes sense for a reference work. In other
words, I can't see an alternative presentation format that might
improve the book as a tutorial that would not destroy the reference
value.</p><p>This book is well-written, clear and accurate. While there
are close to 650 pages, it contains no fluff. While the Perl
language is fairly simple, its real power is in its functions and
libraries, which are covered thoroughly. A two-word description of
this book is &ldquo;comprehensive reference&rdquo;. If you are going to be
programming with Perl, this book should be in your library.</p></div></div>
