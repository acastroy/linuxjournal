Binary jokes are always fun, and although technically I could say &ldquo;welcome to
issue &lt;BINARY_NUMBER&gt;&rdquo; every month, it's more fun with nice round numbers
like 256. Plus, this is our <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming</em></span> issue, and there are 10 types of
programmers: those who understand binary, and those who don't.

Reuven M. Lerner starts things off by not only pointing out why we should use
databases for data manipulation, but also how and why we should focus on
doing so efficiently. Databases, SQL databases specifically, often are a
performance bottleneck in applications, but that doesn't mean databases
aren't incredibly useful and efficient. If we use them correctly, they will
do what they do best: manipulate data for us.

Kyle Rankin guides us into the murky world of 3D printing software. With
the popularity of 3D printing on the rise, so goes the proprietary
interests in the technology. Trying to keep the world of 3D printing as
open as possible is challenging, but thankfully there's still hope. Kyle
covers a few open-source options for printing and
design sharing, and sets the stage for his concluding article next month,
when he'll provide an Octoprint tutorial.

My column this month is helpful as well, but in a very different way. I was
on vacation in the Smoky Mountains when I wrote this article, and rest and
relaxation were on my mind. So I decided it was a good time to help
everyone relax, nerd style. Whether you're a casual puzzle-gamer or a
hardcore Orc-slayer, I tried to cover some of my favorite options for
wasting away your vacation time behind a screen. (Note: any wasting of time
at work should not be blamed on me, but rather on &ldquo;burn-in
testing&rdquo; for
your workstation hardware!)
</p><p>
Logic programming is vital for many applications from artificial
intelligence to creating mazes for video games. Sergii Dymchenko introduces
Picat this month, which is a programming tool for testing and
programming with logic. If you're familiar with tools like Prolog, Picat
will be a pleasant step up, but even if you've never dealt with tabled
logic before, Sergii's article will help you (and your programs) think like
a Vulcan in no time. It's only logical!
</p><p>
Hash tables are incredibly powerful programming constructs, especially for
storing unsorted (or unsortable) data. Ideally, the hash tables will make
it easy to retrieve the data in your program and help manage seemingly
unmanageable chunks of data as efficiently as possible. Conceptually it can
be hard to wrap your brain around, but Mihalis Tsoukalos helps us
understand and implement hash tables in our programs. If you're finding
yourself needing arrays full of arrays in order to handle your variables,
be sure to read his article!

Steven Buczkowski takes us into the world of Slurm. (For you
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Futurama</em></span> fans,
I assure you no Wormulon queens were abused in the making of this article.)
Specifically, Steven explains how jobs are managed in a Slurm cluster and
how utilizing a MySQL database for controlling those jobs is an ideal and
efficient way to do it. If you've moved from manually load-balancing your
jobs to a full-blown cluster environment, Steven's article will help
jumpstart your methodology.
</p><p>
If you're not a programmer (or not a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Futurama</em></span> fan), this issue still has
plenty to keep you entertained and informed. We have new
product announcements, tech tips and tons of features for any open-source
enthusiast&mdash;programmer or not. And if you're not careful,
this issue might turn you into a programmer as well! Heck, if you got my
binary joke earlier, you're already on your way to the twisted mindset of a
programmer!
