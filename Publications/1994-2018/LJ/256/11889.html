Test your hardware in the best way ever&mdash;play some games!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1944580.0x1a3c358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
As I write this here in the US, summer is raging. The heat, humidity and relentless
sunshine makes it miserable to go outside. So for this article, I figured
I'd
take an indoor vacation from the weather and play some games. Gone
are the days when people would pretend first-person shooters didn't interest
them anyway. Although I love <span   class="emphasis"><em>Nethack</em></span> as much as the next nerd, sometimes I just
want to shoot zombies. Let's look at a few of my current favorite games.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1944580.0x1a3c568"></a>
Steam</h2></div></div><p>
Before I talk about games, I have to mention Steam
(<a href="http://www.steampowered.com" target="_self">www.steampowered.com</a>). I haven't been following the development
of SteamOS very closely, but the Linux client for Steam is simply
amazing. You can filter the available games by Linux compatibility and
purchase games like anyone else. Other game-buying options
are available, like Desura (<a href="http://www.desura.com" target="_self">www.desura.com</a>), for example, but for the largest
selection of commercial games, Steam is the platform of choice. Plus,
if you have Windows and/or OS X, your games will work on multiple
platforms. But enough about the underpinnings&mdash;today, I'm talking
about games.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1944580.0x1a3c720"></a>
Zombies!</h2></div></div><p>
There's just something about zombies that I find appealing. Not that
I want to hang out at a zombie bar or anything, but when it comes to
first-person shooter games, zombies are my favorite shotgun fodder. I
suspect it's because I don't really like shooting
<span   class="emphasis"><em>people</em></span> in FPS games,
but zombies are already dead. And creepy. And hungry for brains. Shooting
them is a fairly easy call.
</p><p>
Because I'm not alone in my like of zombie mayhem, several such
games are available. The ones I normally turn to are in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Left 4
Dead</em></span> series
(Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11889f1.large.jpg"><img src="11889f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The <span  class="emphasis"><em>Left 4 Dead</em></span> franchise is full of awesome zombies and has
an easy mode for wimps like me.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b><span class="emphasis"><em>Left 4 Dead</em></span>
(Original):</b></span>
</p><p>
This was the first Steam game I played on Linux. I was thrilled (and
admittedly surprised) how well it worked. The graphics are smooth, the
controls are responsive, and the program is running on a native Linux
operating system! <span   class="emphasis"><em>Left 4 Dead</em></span> offers individual or multiplayer modes,
and either is fun. I'm not a terribly skilled gamer, so the on-line games
tend to be more competitive than I'm up for. Thankfully, the single-player
games with AI teammates are quite enjoyable&mdash;even for those of
us who play on easy mode!
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em><span class="bold"><b>Left 4 Dead 2</b></span>:</em></span>
</p><p>
The truth of the matter is, although I did purchase this game, I don't
find it any more or less entertaining than the original. If you're more of a
gamer than me, you'll probably appreciate the improvements in gameplay,
graphics and so on. The premise, at least for me, is the same. Shoot the
zombies. If you have to choose between <span   class="emphasis"><em>L4D</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>L4D2</em></span>, I recommend getting
the second game, because the improvements are worth it. 
If you have <span   class="emphasis"><em>L4D</em></span> and you're just a casual zombie
shooter,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>L4D2</em></span> might be a disappointment. But still, zombies are awesome. 
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Dying Light</em></span> (via Steam):</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dying Light</em></span> is a zombie-esque game released this year that has a
zombie feel, although the zombies are non-traditional&mdash;they're more
monster-like (Figure 2). There is also an interesting day/night element
to the game that actually starts to affect the player psychologically. I
find my anxiety level increasing as the sun goes down.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11889f2.large.jpg"><img src="11889f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The <span  class="emphasis"><em>Dying Light</em></span> zombies are non-traditional, but still creepy
enough to tickle my zombie bone.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dying Light</em></span> is one of the pricier options for the zombie hunter. At
the time of this writing, it weighs in at $59.99 and is available via
Steam. If you've played the <span   class="emphasis"><em>L4D</em></span> franchise and want more action along
the same vein, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dying Light</em></span> might be right up your alley. I recommend
watching the trailers first though, because $60 is a lot to fork
over for a game you might not like.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Island</em></span> Series (via Steam):</b></span>
</p><p>
I'm going to lump all the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dead Island</em></span> games together,
because conceptually,
they're similar (although I admittedly haven't played <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dead Island
Riptide</em></span>). At first it seems like just another zombie shooter with a
tropical-themed background (Figure 3), however, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dead
Island</em></span> actually is a lot
more fun than just shooting zombies. The world itself is very interactive
(kick a beach ball, use it as a weapon), and with vehicle upgrades, side
missions and the potential for awesome modifications, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dead
Island</em></span> is
a series that puts a sunny disposition on a dire world. The disconnect
between sunny beaches and undead zombies is refreshing&mdash;at least in a
grab-your-shotgun-fun sort of way.

Strategy Games (Turn-Based and Real-Time)</h2></div></div><p>
Strategy games have been on Linux for a while, largely because
they don't require awesome 3D graphics in order to be incredibly
entertaining. Unfortunately, most of my personal favorite RTS (real-time
strategy) games haven't been ported to Linux. I'm honestly not sure why,
because I suspect like me, many folks would flock to download
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Starcraft</em></span>
if there were a native client. Yes, there are ways to play games like
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Starcraft</em></span> via Wine, but that's always a pain, and for
me, it only <span   class="emphasis"><em>mostly</em></span> works. So for this article, I focus
on native Linux games.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Battle for Wesnoth</em></span>:</b></span>
</p><p>
This has been a staple Linux game for many years. It's a turn-based
strategy game and has great gameplay along with cool graphics. If I had
to come up with a downside, it would be that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Battle for
Wesnoth</em></span> is too robust! There are
16 races in the fantasy world, and it supports single-player, multiplayer
and on-line modes. The initial learning curve isn't bad, but I had a tough
time moving from single-player mode into multiplayer/on-line mode. I just
got my rear end handed to me constantly. Still, the single-player mode
is fun, and I really enjoy the game itself.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Hedgewars</em></span>:</b></span>
</p><p>
I'm not sure if <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hedgewars</em></span> falls into the
&ldquo;strategy&rdquo; realm, but it's
turn-based and tons of fun. If you've ever played (or seen)
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Worms</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Hedgewars</em></span> will look very familiar. Instead of battling worms, however,
the soldiers are pink hedgehogs (Figure 4), because why not? In
the same style as <span   class="emphasis"><em>Worms</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Hedgewars</em></span> is full of fun, cartoony graphics
and a surprisingly robust set of weapons, costumes and mods.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Hedgewars</em></span> 
is fun with a capital F, and it makes me smile every time I play it.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11889f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. It's hard to hate pink hedgehogs&mdash;unless you're an opposing
pink hedgehog.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
<span class="emphasis"><em>0 A.D.</em></span>:</b></span>
</p><p>
This game actually started its life as a modification for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Age of
Empires II</em></span>,
but it has since become its own game entirely. It's a classic real-time
strategy game pitting one group against another, but it has a unique take
on world building. Maps are inspired by real geography, and although largely
fictional, the game has a very historical feeling to it (Figure 5).
<span   class="emphasis"><em>0 A.D.</em></span> still is fairly early in development and likely
will get better
as time goes on.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11889f5.large.jpg"><img src="11889f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. <span  class="emphasis"><em>0 A.D.</em></span> feels like it was filmed 2,000 years
ago&mdash;which is odd,
because 3D cameras weren't common back then.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b><span class="emphasis"><em>Civilization 5</em></span>:</b></span>
</p><p>
Another in a long line of successful commercial strategy games, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Civ
5</em></span> is available via Steam. If you like the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Civilization</em></span> franchise, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Civ
5</em></span> will appeal to you. I personally never enjoyed playing
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Civ</em></span>, so the
latest iteration doesn't really float my boat, but it felt wrong not to
include it in a list of strategy games.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Defense of the Ancients 2</em></span>:</b></span>
</p><p>
The last game on my strategy list is a frustrating one. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Defense of the
Ancients 2</em></span> (<span   class="emphasis"><em>DotA 2</em></span>) is an incredibly fun game available exclusively on
Steam. The problem is it's really hard! The on-line community playing
<span   class="emphasis"><em>DotA</em></span>
is huge, and n00bs like me really struggle to learn the game well enough
to enjoy it. If you're a gamer that is good at picking up skills quickly,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Defense of the Ancients 2</em></span> is a game you'll probably love.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11889f6.large.jpg"><img src="11889f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. <span  class="emphasis"><em>Defense of the Ancients 2</em></span>&mdash;it's so awesome,
but it's so stinkin' hard.

First-Person Games</h2></div></div><p>
Generally, these are referred to as first-person shooters, but some have
more than just shooting involved. Also, all the zombie games I mentioned
at previously are first-person games; I just thought zombies deserved their
own category.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Borderlands</em></span> Series:</b></span>
</p><p>
It's funny that games have become like movies and have sequels,
prequels and so on. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Borderlands</em></span> franchise is no different, with multiple
games including a prequel. I personally like
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Borderlands</em></span> because of the
cross between RPG and FPS. The graphics also are unique (Figure 7).
They're not quite cartoony, but they definitely feel less realistic,
which oddly increases their appeal. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Borderlands</em></span> environment makes
me smile, which is an interesting trait for a game where monsters try
to kill you. Check it out if only to see the graphics. It's a commercial
game series, available on Steam.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11889f7.large.jpg"><img src="11889f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. <span  class="emphasis"><em>Borderlands</em></span> has awesome graphics&mdash;the perfect blend of
realistic and cartoony.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b><span class="emphasis"><em>Metro: Last Light
Redux</em></span>:</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Metro: Last Light Redux</em></span> improves graphics and gameplay to the fairly
unique, not-quite-zombie-apocalypse game. Taking place in Russia, this
game does include mutants, but it also contains a far more insidious
enemy: other humans. Exploring the darker side of humanity in a
post-nuclear world, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Metro: Last Light Redux</em></span> is an interesting game with a
unique gameplay. Check out the trailers on the Steam Web site, and see
if this game (and series) is your cup of tea.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
<span class="emphasis"><em>SuperTuxKart</em></span>:</b></span>
</p><p>
If you're a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mario Cart</em></span> fan or don't mind a little comic relief in
your 3D racing games, <span   class="emphasis"><em>SuperTuxKart</em></span> is easy to love. It has lots
of great tracks, multiple game modes, awesome characters, responsive
controls and even a multiplayer mode. Much like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mario
Cart</em></span>, it's fun
to play even if you're not a hard-core gamer (Figure 8). You can
download this enjoyable open-source game from its SourceForge home page:
<a href="http://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net" target="_self">supertuxkart.sourceforge.net</a>.

Other Cool Games</h2></div></div><p>
Many other games are tons of fun, but don't fit directly
into my categories. The easiest way to discover new games is to browse
the Steam Web site, check out the Desura offerings or watch for Humble
Bundle game packs that almost always include Linux games. Here are a
few I thought were important, but didn't fit into a specific
category above.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Voxelands</em></span>:</b></span>
</p><p>
First, a confession: I don't understand what people like about
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Minecraft</em></span>. I
really don't. I've tried, but I just can't seem to comprehend its
draw. Nevertheless, if you like that sort of game, you should give
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Voxelands</em></span> a try. It's free and under rapid development with new maps,
tools and so on.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Tales of Maj'Eyal</em></span>:</b></span>
</p><p>
I guess this is technically a turn-based strategy, but to me,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tales of Maj'Eyal</em></span> feels
more like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Nethack</em></span> on steroids. The map is randomly generated, but the
game doesn't suffer from lack of a planned map. In fact, it makes each
game unique. Normally, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Nethack</em></span> annoys me with its
randomness, but <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tales of Maj'Eyal</em></span>
makes it feel like a plus as opposed to a negative. It's important to
note that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tales of Maj'Eyal</em></span> is free to download, but if you want to
support the company and keep your games in one place, you can buy it
on the Steam store as well. It's $7, which seems fair for a game that I
enjoy playing. I recommend trying it out with the free download first
and then buying it if you like it.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><span class="emphasis"><em>
Anodyne</em></span>:</b></span>
</p><p>
I'm not sure why this game lands on my short list. Don't get me wrong;
it's fun and has a dreamy soundtrack that reminds me of the 1990s Nintendo
world, but it seems like more modern-themed games would be better. Perhaps
it's the nostalgia that draws me in (Figure 9). If you ever played
the original NES games like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dragon Quest</em></span> or
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Final Fantasy</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Anodyne</em></span> 
likely will appeal to you. You can get it from <a href="http://www.anodynegame.com" target="_self">www.anodynegame.com</a>
for $9 and get a Steam key as well.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11889f9.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. Why yes, we <span  class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> going to party like it's 1991!
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1944580.0x1d491c0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Emulation:</b></p><p>
Speaking of NES games from my youth, actually playing those games is a
viable option as well. Acquiring the original ROM files is still legally
and morally awkward, but if you're okay with downloading ROM files you may
or may not have the right to own, emulation is a great way to play the
actual games from your youth on a modern computer. The emulation programs
all support controllers, and inventive gamers even can connect the
original controllers to their computers for authentic gameplay. (Stay tuned
for a future Open-Source Classroom column where I describe the build of
my emulation station.)

Game On!</h2></div></div><p>
Gaming isn't just for gamers, because if that were the case, I'd never
get invited to the party. And although it's taken decades to get here,
we're finally to the place where using Linux doesn't mean games are
inaccessible or limited to crappy clones. If you like having fun or
just need a break from the grind, give some of these games a try.
I promise you'll find something worth wasting time!
