StackIQ's Stacki</h2></div></div><p>
StackIQ, a provider of IT automation solutions for the data center and cloud,
recently launched Stacki, a fast and easy-to-use open-source provisioning
tool for Linux servers. Short for &ldquo;Stack Installer&rdquo;, Stacki is
designed to take any bare physical or virtual
machine&mdash;with zero prerequisites&mdash;and turn it into a working Linux server in an organization's
network. Stacki provides &ldquo;step zero&rdquo; automation, allowing organizations to
spin up Linux servers without the time, complexity and risk that can impede
installations. The solution also addresses a critical &ldquo;missing
link&rdquo;
in today's toolchain for IT operators&mdash;that is, automated RAID configuration
and disk partitioning functionality. Stacki is a parallel, package-based
installer for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and its derivatives, such as CentOS,
Oracle Linux and Scientific Linux. In tandem with this new open-source
initiative, StackIQ made available a one-day, on-site Stacki training and an
implementation service for users who want to use the tools immediately for
production servers.

Varnish Software's Varnish Plus</h2></div></div><p>
Until this newest release of Varnish Plus, Varnish Software's complete,
enterprise-level HTTP accelerator solution, the company's customers had
to rely on third-party products for SSL/TLS. Henceforth, however, Varnish
Plus now offers full, integrated SSL/TLS support on both the HTTP back end
and client side, allowing users to improve their Web site security and
simplify their Web architectures, ultimately saving time and money. By
enabling SSL/TLS in Varnish Plus, customers will enable encrypted and secure
communication on both the front and back end and both HTTP server and client. On
the client side, the HTTP server intercepts Web requests before they reach a
Web server. The SSL/TLS support on this side enables traffic encryption
between the client and Varnish. On the back end, the HTTP client fetches
content missing in the cache from the Web server, enabling content to be
fetched over the encrypted SSL/TLS, which particularly benefits customers who
run a fully encrypted data center or have Web servers that reside in a
different location from their Varnish Plus servers.

Rockstor, Inc.'s Rockstor NAS</h2></div></div><p>
The latest dispatch from Rockstor, Inc., involves a major upgrade to the
company's RockStor NAS (Network Attached Storage) solution. The company
describes the new 3.8-0 release of the free and open-source Rockstor as
an &ldquo;exciting update with a lot of improvements and new features&rdquo;, the
most salient of which is a tightening up the Rock-on app framework. New
Rock-ons include Syncthing, Transmission and BTSync. Other improvements
include added functional tests to improve coverage by about 10% and the
correction of a Samba password reset issue.

Red Hat Software Collections</h2></div></div><p>
Red Hat says that the more frequent release schedule of its Red Hat Software
Collections gives developers a deeper selection of the latest tools without
sacrificing Red Hat's enterprise-grade support for building enterprise
applications, including those built for Linux container deployments. The
Collections, recently upgraded to v2.0, is a package of essential Web
development tools, dynamic languages, open-source databases, C and C++
compilers, the Eclipse IDE, and a variety of development and performance
management tools. These updated components can be installed alongside
versions included in base Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Version 2.0 includes more
than ten new collections, such as Python 3.4 (while supporting Python
2.7 and
3.3), PHP 5.6 and Passenger 4.0, not to mention several other new updates to
the already included collections per Red Hat's curation. In addition, Dockerfiles
for many of the most popular collections, such as Perl, PHP and Python,
also are available to help developers dive head first into the world of Linux
containers.

ClusterHQ's Flocker</h2></div></div><p>
For good reason, forward-thinking developers and organizations are latching
onto containers, which are emerging as one of IT's most important
innovations since virtualization. Riding this wave is the ClusterHQ and its
Flocker 1.0 open-source container data management software application.
ClusterHQ explains that Flocker, by enabling stateful Docker containers to be
moved between servers easily, facilitates widespread production deployment of
containers for databases, queues and key value stores. As modern applications
are being built from both stateless and stateful microservices, Flocker
enables and simplifies the process of containerizing entire applications,
including their state, to take full advantage of the portability and massive
per-server density benefits inherent in containers. This operational freedom
allows DevOps organizations to increase the value of their Docker investment
and opens the door for containers to be used in a greater variety of
mainstream enterprise use cases in production. The Apache-licensed Flocker
1.0 is available for download at ClusterHQ's Web site.

Jonathan Lazar, Daniel Goldstein and Anne Taylor's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ensuring Digital Accessibility
through Process and Policy</em></span> (Morgan Kaufmann)</h2></div></div><p>
Our Linux Community, which has slayed many a dragon-like challenge, is home
to some of the most impressive IT talent on Earth. One frontier to which this
talent could be applied wisely is the expansion of digital accessibility to
those with disabilities. A guide to navigating this frontier is the new
Morgan Kaufmann book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ensuring Digital Accessibility through Process and
Policy</em></span> by Jonathan Lazar, Daniel Goldstein and Anne Taylor. As the title
implies, this book provides readers with must-know information on digital
accessibility from both technical and policy perspectives. Many organizations
may not realize that inaccessible digital interfaces and content may indeed
present forms of societal discrimination that can be illegal under various
laws. In the book, the authors&mdash;with legal, technical and research
expertise&mdash;explore the history of accessible computing, why digital accessibility is
 socially and legally important, the technical details (interface
standards and
evaluation methods) and legal details (laws, lawsuits and regulations).
Myriad case studies illustrate best practices for guaranteeing access to the
world of digital information for all users.

Matt Sainsbury's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Game Art</em></span> (No Starch Press)</h2></div></div><p>
In the world of video games, a lone independent developer on a tiny budget can
create an experience every bit as compelling as a blockbuster built by a team
of hundreds. But like all works of art, every game begins with a spark of
inspiration and a passion to create. Those interested in the creative process
behind video games will find great delight in art critic Matt Sainsbury's
new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Game Art</em></span>. Subtitled <span   class="emphasis"><em>Art from 40 Video Games and Interviews with
Their Creators</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Game Art</em></span> is a collection of breathtaking concept art and
behind-the-scenes interviews from influential video game studios, both major
and independent. Readers can immerse themselves in fantastic artwork and
explore the creative thinking behind more than 40 console, mobile and PC games.

CIARA's ORION HF320D Server</h2></div></div><p>
The long and the short of the new ORION HF320D server from CIARA is this: it
is reputedly &ldquo;the first and world's fastest overclocked 2U 2-Node High
Frequency Trading (HFT) server&rdquo;. Boasting two independent Intel
processors with performance up to 4.5GHz on eight cores in a 2U rackmount
chassis, CIARA says that the ORION HF320D server &ldquo;officially raises the
bar on speed and density for high frequency trading&rdquo;. The ORION HF320D is
designed to handle today's high frequency trading algorithms and data
market analysis, both of which require the fastest speed and lowest latency
on the largest number of cores. CIARA's formula lies in the power
combination of the latest generation of Intel processors (Haswell E) with the
CIARA proprietary half-width motherboard design, which together unlock a vast
array of new opportunities for performance and low latency. Elements that
round out the ORION HF320D's package include NVMe SSD, LSI 3108 hardware
RAID, Processor Cache acceleration and the latest technology in liquid
cooling from Asetek.
