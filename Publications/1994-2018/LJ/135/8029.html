RTLinux meets one of the engineering world's most
demanding control requirements, without requiring
separate controller hardware and costing substantially less than
comparable proprietary systems.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb01580.0xbf9298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
One of the most demanding applications of real-time
control is the active magnetic bearing (AMB).
Suspending a shaft rotating faster than 10,000 RPMs
in a magnetic field with a gap of .015 inches&mdash;roughly
the size of a grain of table salt&mdash;requires
precise, reliable control of the magnetic field.
Magnetic suspensions inherently are unstable. Think
of a trapeze artist balancing a long pole on her chin,
and you can appreciate the difficulty that a control
system encounters when stabilizing a magnetic bearing. Magnetic bearings
provide several advantages, however, which justify
their use. The major advantage is magnetic
bearings eliminate physical contact between the shaft
and the support, minimizing friction and eliminating the
wear inherent to conventional roller bearings.
</p><p>
A recent application under development in Japan is an implantable heart
pump. Because magnetic bearings require no maintenance, this is an ideal
situation in which to use them. For the same reason, satellite wheels
also are a logical application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb01580.0xbf93f8"></a>
The Test Setup</h2></div></div><p>
The experimental test rig, shown in Figure 1,
consists of two eight-pole laminated stator assemblies,
with individual windings on each of the poles. The
bearing assembly includes inductive gap sensors at
the centerline of each pair of diametrically opposed
poles. These bearings support a two-foot-long shaft
driven by a brushless DC motor. Figure 2 shows a
schematic of a single axis. The controller uses the
signal from the gap sensor to adjust the current
from the power amplifiers driving the magnetic
coils to keep the rotating shaft centered in the
gap. The original controller was an analog circuit,
which was replaced by the digital controller. The
capability of running either the analog or digital
controller is retained. The digital controller is
implemented on an Intel Pentium III PC with a multichannel data acquisition board
and a multichannel analog output board. The PC
is configured as a dual-boot system, and the user
selects plain Linux or RTLinux at startup.

A real-time OS must ensure that a specific task
executes at a fixed rate, regardless of the many
system-level demands that burden the OS. To meet
this requirement, two organizations, FSMLabs and
RTAI, have developed special-purpose kernels that
run Linux as a low-priority task within a real-time
OS. This substantially reduces the timing from the
hundreds of milliseconds on desktop systems to the
microsecond range. It also allows the user to control precisely
the timing of critical control processes.
</p><p>
For this magnetic bearing project, I selected the free RTLinux
implementation from FSMLabs. RTLinux, developed
by Michael Barabanov and Victor Yodaiken in 1996,
currently is marketed by FSMLabs, a private company
located in New Mexico. FSMLabs provides two versions of RTLinux, including
RTLinux/Free, which I used for this project.
FSMLabs holds a software patent on RTLinux, but the
patent's license allows it to be used in projects
licensed under the GNU GPL.
</p><p>
Conceptually, RTLinux splits the OS into user space and a real-time kernel.
You may think of these as two separate cities,
walled off from each other and able to communicate only by guarded
pathways, such as real-time, first-in-first-out devices
(RT-FIFOs). User space is the familiar Linux system with all its friendly
utilities, such as the vi editor, the GCC compiler
and the shutdown command. The real-time kernel is the Spartan
environment that relentlessly executes the real-time task
regardless of the activities in user space.
</p><p>
Real-time programs are coded as kernel modules and do not
use the main{} program construct of user-space
C programs. The module requires two functions:
init_module, which is called when starting, and cleanup_module, which is
called when turning off the real-time module. The init_module
creates the entry point for the real-time module
and allocates the RT-FIFOs used to communicate
with user space. To start the real-time module,
use the insmod command. Once the real-time module
starts, it can be stopped only by issuing the rmmod command
or by pulling the plug on the processor. As a new user of RTLinux, I
was quite unnerved to discover that despite issuing the shutdown command,
the controller continued to run.

A Control Theory Palimpsest</h2></div></div><p>
Control theory, central to all modern technologies
from the automobile to the jetliner, is an extensive
field in which graduate students have toiled for many
decades. I cannot cover this extensive body of theory
here, but I can explain the essentials of the digital
control for the magnetic bearing. First, the quantity
to be controlled is instrumented and measured. In
this case, the quantity is the gap between the rotating bearing
and the magnetic poles of the bearing. This gap
is converted to a voltage with signal conditioners
and input to an analog/digital input (AI) board. In my
setup, four separate gap sensor signals control the
rotating shaft. All four gap signal voltages are
sampled simultaneously.
</p><p>
The gap is controlled by the current traveling through
the magnets, which are driven by eight power
amplifiers. The power amplifiers are controlled by
the voltage from a separate digital/analog output
(AO) board. The AO board receives a digital input
and converts it to a voltage that is held constant until the next signal.
This sample-and-hold operation is fundamental
to all digital control systems. In the control loop,
the AO board receives the processed signals from
the AI board after numerical processing. In an ideal
digital controller, both AI and AO operations occur
simultaneously at precise constant intervals. Although
impossible to achieve this ideal, you must ensure
that the code within the control algorithm runs
efficiently. In my control program this occurs at
10kHz.
</p><p>
The numerical operations within the control program
include the history of the input, x, and the output,
y, of the controller for several previous steps. These
are stored in memory and shifted one increment each
time the control loop executes. The history is
incorporated in a difference equation:
</p><p>
y(n)=A*y(n-1)+B*y(n-2)+...+C*x(n) + D*x(n-1) +...
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb01580.0xbf9be0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where y(n) is the output of the controller for
the current time step, y(n-1) is the output of the
controller in the previous time step, y(n-2) is the
output two steps in the past, y(n-3) is three steps in
the past and so forth to the depth demanded by the
sophistication of the control algorithm. Similarly,
x(n) is the input voltage for the current time step,
and x(n-1) is the input for the previous step. A, B,
C, D and the rest are constant coefficients determined by the
particular control law implementation. Controllers
are either single-input-single-output (SISO) or
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO). In my magnetic
bearing test setup, y is the voltage driving the power
amplifier, and x is the signal from the gap sensor.
I use the three previous values in my magnetic bearing
difference equation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb01580.0xbf9ce8"></a>
Digital Control Implementation</h2></div></div><p>
The digital controller is implemented on an Intel Pentium III
PC operating at 1GHz with a six-slot PCI bus.
The system was procured as a customized desktop personal computer with
Red Hat Linux version 7.2 installed.
In the laboratory the PC is not networked. I installed version 3.1 of
RTLinux from a tar archive downloaded from FSMLabs.
</p><p>
The three possible approaches for selecting the digital acquisition and
control (DAC) boards are to write the required board driver software, to
obtain a driver from an open-source project such as Comedi and to use
vendor-supplied driver software. The first and second options require a high level
of sophistication and expertise with using Linux and data
acquisition programming. The second option reflects
the open-source nature of the Linux system, but
the selection of vendors is limited and the latest
products often are unavailable. The third option,
although it requires the least expertise, places the
user at the mercy of the board vendor. The vendors
supplying and supporting the necessary drivers
are limited and quite often use the same sources
as the second option. In the end, I chose the third option and
purchased two PCI bus multichannel DAC boards from
United Electronics, Inc. These came with the required RTLinux drivers.
</p><p>
Before implementing the digital control law, I
performed tests to characterize the digital system
behavior. These tests are various program codes that
evaluate conversion and timing interactions of the
digital boards. For my primary functional test,
I designed and coded a C language module that
reads the analog data on the analog input board,
converts it to floating point variables, converts
it back to a digital variable and then outputs the
signal by way of the analog output board.
</p><p>
Listing 1 shows the skeleton of the C program for
the primary functional test. At the heart of the real-time control
program is the RTLinux function, pthread_wait_np,
which suspends execution of the currently running
real-time thread until the start of the next
period. This thread is marked for execution using
pthread_make_periodic_np. The thread gives up control
until the next time period. The default arithmetic
in RTLinux is integer. My control application
requires floating point, which is turned on by
pthread_setfp_np. A comparison of the input and
output is recorded on a Tektronix two-channel digital
storage oscilloscope. Figure 3 shows a typical record
of system performance on this test. The main loop in
the software is set at 10kHz in this plot; the analog
input is a 1,000Hz sawtooth. The output shows the step
waveform characteristic of sample-and-hold operation.

A more intuitive way to test the operation of the
system is to hook the analog output to an audio
amplifier and speaker and input a sine wave from an
external signal generator. I did this, and the tone was
clean and steady. The original analog controller is
a simple lead-lag filter on each of the four bearing
axes, which is duplicated with the difference equation:
</p><p>
[ y(n) = 0.7467*y(n-1 )+ 4.6380*x(n) - 4.5189*x(n-1)]

Figure 4 shows the digital and analog controller responses to a mechanical
impulse on the shaft. The responses are virtually identical. In this figure, the
digital controller response is shown at the top, and the analog controller response
is at the bottom. The time shown in the figure is 100 milliseconds. The
digital loop is operating at 10kHz in a MIMO configuration, which has five input channels and eight output channels.

Advanced Experiments</h2></div></div><p>
Alternate control laws are implemented easily in C and experimentally
verified. One of the more robust of these is shown in the difference equation:
</p><p>
y(n) = 1.4934*y(n-1) - 0.5576*y(n-2) + 0.5795*x(n) + .01487*x(n-1) - 0.5646* x(n-2)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb01580.0xbfa8f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The rotor has spun up to 11,000 RPMs successfully,
with the AMB under full digital control, passing
through a critical speed at 2,700 RPMs. In virtually all
rotating machinery, from the humblest hair dryer to
the modern passenger jet engine, critical speeds
occur at distinct RPMs. At these critical speeds,
the vibration of the rotating shaft grows
large and places high loads on the bearings and
other components. These present extreme tests for
the bearings.
</p><p>
To change the coefficients of the control law while
the rig is operating, I used RT-FIFOs. These are
first-in-first-out files for communicating between
Linux user space and RTLinux threads. Because
RT-FIFOs are unidirectional, I created two separate
files for two-way communication with the control
module. Function rtf_create(fifo_id_no, fifo_length)
allocates a buffer of the specified size for the
specified FIFO ( /dev/rtf0, /dev/rtf1,..../dev/rtf64
). It must be called from init_module(). Function
rtf_destroy deallocates the FIFO at the completion
of execution. It can be called from init_module(
) or clean-up_module(). This allows me to
change the control law on the fly by changing
the difference equation coefficients while the
real-time module is running. Using the function
rtf_get(fifo_id,&amp;variables,sizeof(variables)) within
the real-time thread reads the coefficients in a
non-blocking mode. The user-space code for sending
the coefficients to the real-time module is:

<pre     class="programlisting">

ctl = open("/dev/rtf1",O_WRONLY);
write(ctl,&amp;coeffs,sizeof(coeffs));
ctl = close(ctl);

</pre>
</p><p>
This code is embedded in an NCURSES interface, which
allows me to change the coefficients with
manual entries as the rig is rotating. The NCURSES
Programming How-To by Pradeep Padala (see the on-line Resources) is an
excellent resource for this work.
</p><p>
In a similar way, I can access the data stream in
the control program and send it to user space. The
appropriate function in the real-time module is
rtf_put(framerate_rtfifo_id, volts, offset). In user
space, send the output to a file with <tt  >cat /dev/rtf0 &gt;
file</tt> . A simple C program to convert the file to a
readable form must be written.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
RTLinux is used to control a working rotor test rig
at Tufts University. The controller is realized
on a conventional Pentium III personal computer
using the RTLinux extension of the Linux operating
system. The control algorithm is implemented in C.
Various control laws can be implemented and tried on
an actual experiment.
</p><p>
An additional advantage is the elimination of a target
computer, since the real-time OS operates on the same
processor as the host computer. Most applications
developed as digital control systems launch as
a startup executable on a proprietary real-time
target computer. The approach presented here
differs; it does not target a RT controller based on
a proprietary development system. It uses a Linux
software environment developed for applications in
control and data acquisition requiring hard real-time
(deterministic) execution.
