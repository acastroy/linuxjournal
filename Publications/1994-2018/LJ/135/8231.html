<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #135, July 2005</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

Linux kernel development is in the process of creating
a new push for stability. <span   class="bold"><b>Greg
Kroah-Hartman</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>Chris Wright</b></span> have volunteered to maintain a tightly
controlled <span   class="bold"><b>stable</b></span> tree. The stable trees of the
old days would alternate with development trees
in cycles measured in years. This new stable tree
will exist concurrently with the development tree
and will consist solely of important bug fixes. So
the 2.6.11 kernel release from <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> has
been followed by 2.6.11.1, 2.6.11.2 and additional
stabilizing releases from Greg and Chris. Even after
2.6.12 is released, the 2.6.11.z tree may continue
to stabilize, even as 2.6.12.1 comes out, and so
on. Unlike previous stable series, whose maintainers
had wide latitude to choose which patches to accept,
there are strict rules over what can go into this new
stable branch. Even the method of considering patches,
and the time between patch submissions and patch
acceptance or rejection, is tightly regulated. The
stable tree has been dubbed by Linus, the &ldquo;sucker&rdquo;
tree, because he felt no one in his or her right mind would
take on the burden of maintaining it. Chris and Greg
have risen to the challenge, and the process is itself
still undergoing changes in all aspects. But it does
appear that stability is once again a serious target
of Linux development.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>SysFS</b></span> filesystem recently felt a pang of
uncertainty. One of the driving forces behind its
development always has been to replace the chaos
and historical baggage of ProcFS with something
clean and sane. The developers hoped that, given
a fresh start, the old mistakes could be avoided.
Recently, however, kernel folks realized that one
of the SysFS directories had been put in the wrong
place: /sys/block, it was felt, should really have
been /sys/class/block instead. Too late! A great mass
of user code already had come to rely on the existing
directory location. Greg Kroah-Hartman reluctantly
had to admit that the SysFS inconsistency could not
be repaired. The first spot of age has appeared on
the pristine face of SysFS.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SquashFS</b></span> continues to try for kernel inclusion
and continues to come up short, and its principal
developer, <span   class="bold"><b>Phillip Lougher</b></span>, grows more and more
frustrated. One obstacle appears to be cultural:
the kernel developers would like to hear convincing
reasons in favor of inclusion; while Phillip has
been, as he's said, more concerned with coding the
filesystem than selling it. Other obstacles are more
technical. Currently, for example, SquashFS has
a file size limit of 4GB. Of course, because
SquashFS is a compressed filesystem, this really
amounts to about 8MB of actual data. Also,
it recently was pointed out that readdir() does
not return either the ./ or ../ directories for
SquashFS, as it does for virtually all standard
filesystems. These and other problems continue to
thwart efforts to get SquashFS into the standard
kernel.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>FUSE</b></span> (Filesystem in USErspace) seems to be on the
brink of getting into the main kernel tree, after
spending quite a while in <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span>'s -mm branch.
FUSE has had a rough life, with Linus Torvalds saying
for a long time that he thought a user-space filesystem
was just inherently a bad idea that never would go
anywhere. But, FUSE apparently is turning into the
little engine that could and even its detractors
are having to step aside. Andrew is turning into a
strong proponent and seems ready at last to push it
along to Linus.
</p><p>
Several projects have changed hands recently, or their
maintainers have become officially recognized for the
first time. <span   class="bold"><b>Pete Zaitcev</b></span> has been listed as maintainer
for both the <span   class="bold"><b>USB block driver</b></span> and the <span   class="bold"><b>Yamaha PCI
sound driver</b></span>. <span   class="bold"><b>Herbert Xu</b></span> has replaced
<span   class="bold"><b>James Morris</b></span>
as co-maintainer of the kernel <span   class="bold"><b>crypto
API</b></span>. And <span   class="bold"><b>Gerd
Knorr</b></span> has stepped down as the <span   class="bold"><b>Video4Linux</b></span> maintainer,
leaving that project currently unmaintained.

This 2-D turn-based game offers many strategy choices,
no icky blood and guts and lots of challenging maps.
You control an army of tanks, helicopters, artillery
and other units, and each map gives you a different
set of units to command and different victory
conditions. The project Web site has a tutorial on
creating your own maps too.
</p><p>
The interface is slick and the code is rock solid.
Play &ldquo;hot seat&rdquo; with two players taking turns, by
e-mail or against the computer.
</p><p>
The AI is merciless, even where its own units are
concerned. Sometimes you can hold a defensive line
against a crowd of computer units and pick off the
ones in the middle using artillery. The AI doesn't
seem smart enough to fall back to a better position.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Crimson Fields</em></span> is based on the popular Simple
DirectMedia Layer (SDL), a library that you probably
already have on your system to support other games.

We're counting on our readers even more this year to participate in the
Readers' Choice Awards, and voting will happen in two stages. By
the time you read this, &ldquo;First-Round Voting in 2005 Readers' Choice
Awards&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8266" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8266</a>) will be
underway on the <i  >Linux Journal</i> Web site. The final
ballot will be based on the results of that initial ballot. Final voting
will take place in July, and the winners will be announced in the
November 2005 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. As the name
says, these are the <i  >LJ</i> Readers' Choice Awards, so
get on over to the Web site, read the nomination list and send us your
votes!
</p><p>
For complete information, details and dates regarding the 2005 Readers'
Choice Awards, read &ldquo;New Procedures for 2005 Readers'
Choice Awards&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8192" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8192</a>).

Back in November 2004, Michael Boerner reviewed two of gumstix's tiny
little SBCs, built around the Intel XScale PXA255 chip with Linux
onboard. Since then, gumstix's product line has expanded, and Michael is
following its progress in a two-part review to be featured on the
<i  >Linux Journal</i> Web site. He tells us, &ldquo;My last
review focused on the waysmall computer (WS200-bt) and its components,
as well as using it and its different elements, such as
Bluetooth.&rdquo;
This set of reviews focuses on the revised unit, with the addition of Ethernet,
the new audio, breakout and external Flash storage modules and actually
using the units for embedded applications. In &ldquo;Testing and Building with
the New gumstix SBCs, Part 1&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8268" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8268</a>), Boerner looks at these
gumstix components: gumstix connex, a 10-100baseT wired etherstix and a waysmall
board, which converts the gumstix unit into a waysmall computer.

Kids today have it pretty easy. Ten years ago, we
needed half a magazine merely to get the basics going.
Greg Lehsy's tutorial on configuring XFree86 included
a helpful &ldquo;How to Fry Your Monitor&rdquo; section, covering
things <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to do. Configuring wasn't
just a matter of editing a tweaky config file&mdash;it
was a matter of editing a tweaky config file that,
if you got it wrong, would destroy your hardware.
</p><p>
We also reviewed two proprietary X server packages
with graphical configuration utilities. Both Metro-X
and Accelerated-X came up and ran without editing
any text.
</p><p>
Dean Oisboid surveyed games for Linux, including the
classic <span   class="emphasis"><em>Adventure</em></span> and the BSD games. He ran into
a little trouble with Id Software's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span>: &ldquo;I just
wanted to play <span   class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span> with sound. Having to recompile
the kernel just to get sound had to be insane, but
it seemed that this simple yearning for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span> had
to develop into a learning experience.&rdquo; One quick
compilation tutorial later, &ldquo;It worked!&rdquo;
</p><p>
Advertisers offered everything from full systems
to mouse pads and T-shirts. A Burgess Shale of
distribution ads included Yggdrasil Plug &amp; Play
Linux; Slackware; a Pacific HiTech set with four
distributions including Debian; Caldera Network
Desktop, which was still based on Red Hat; SoftCraft
Linux; LinuxWare from Trans-Ameritech; and S.u.S.E.,
still with all four periods. PromoX advertised a
100MHz Pentium system with 16MB of RAM and a 540MB
hard drive for $2,500.

&ldquo;Everybody in Mali uses Linux.&rdquo; That is no doubt a bit of an
exaggeration, but it's a phrase that you'd hear only in a flat world.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
&mdash;Tom Friedman, in <span   class="emphasis"><em>The World is Flat: A Brief History of
the 21st Century</em></span>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
A telemedicine centre was installed in Segou and Sikasso, regional
capitals of Mali, to improve the ability of these medical centres to
both communicate and provide quality medical information. These systems
are also being used for &ldquo;tele-radiology&rdquo;, where these centres can scan
an x-ray, then transmit it to specialists in Europe or the United States
for a second opinion.

The capability of computers keeps growing and the number of applications
running keeps increasing. The people building the interface keep growing
the complexity of that. It's not for lack of effort but the software
people are losing ground.

You know, Richard [Stallman] is in many ways a

The promise of open source is to eliminate the choice of products and
increase the choice of vendors. Examples: Red Hat, CentOS, Lineox, Tao
Linux, Progeny, SUSE, Mandrake, Conectiva, Ubuntu (Canonical), Xandros,
Lycoris, Knoppix, Debian. This is the paradox of open source.
