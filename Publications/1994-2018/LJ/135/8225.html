Building with the iCalendar standard, it's time to extract
schedule information from a database and build calendars on
the fly.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1282580.0x137a3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, we continued our look at the iCalendar standard, which
makes it possible for programs to exchange calendar and appointment
information. As we saw, an iCalendar file contains one or more events
and tasks. If we make the file available via an HTTP server such as
Apache, we can distribute it to anyone with an iCalendar-compatible
program, such as Mozilla's Sunbird. As we saw last month, we can go one
step further than this, generating an iCalendar file
dynamically, using a CGI program.
</p><p>
Although the programs I presented and discussed last month might be
useful in a limited context, it should be clear to any Web developer
that keeping the date and time information inside of a program would
be foolish, to say the least.
</p><p>
One of the best
ways to keep track of such data is in a relational database such as
PostgreSQL. A relational database allows you to ensure that the data
you have entered is valid and provides you with fast, flexible access
to some or all of the data it contains. Moreover, by storing the
calendar information inside of a database, you can create multiple
versions of the same calendar file, using the same source.
</p><p>
This month, we look at a simple example of a Web-based program
that takes calendar information from a relational database and uses
it to generate an iCalendar data file, which then can be imported into
iCalendar-compliant programs, such as Mozilla's Sunbird.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1282580.0x137a5b0"></a>
Defining the Table</h2></div></div><p>
If we are going to store our calendar information in a relational
database, we need to define at least one table. This is
because everything in a relational database&mdash;often including
configuration and status information&mdash;is stored in a two-dimensional
table, in which the columns define individual fields, and each row
contains one record.
For example, here is how we might define a simple table of events in
PostgreSQL:

<pre     class="programlisting">

CREATE TABLE Events (
  event_id        SERIAL    NOT NULL,
  event_summary   TEXT      NOT NULL
    CHECK (event_summary &lt;&gt; ''),
  event_location   TEXT      NOT NULL
    CHECK (event_location &lt;&gt; ''),
  event_start     TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  event_end       TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  event_timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
    DEFAULT NOW(),

  PRIMARY KEY(event_id)
);

</pre>
</p><p>
The above table contains six columns. The first, event_id, is defined
to be of type SERIAL. If we don't explicitly provide a value for
event_id when adding a row to the table, PostgreSQL retrieves a
new integer value automatically, up to a maximum of
2<sup  >31</sup>. PostgreSQL
allows you to set a larger ceiling to allow the sequence to wrap
around to 1, or both; see the documentation for more details.
</p><p>
The event_id column uniquely identifies rows in our table, and we
tell the database this by marking it as a PRIMARY KEY. This not only
tells other database programmers which column will be used for
retrieving records, but it ensures that values are unique and that the
column is indexed as well.
</p><p>
Another automatically populated column is event_timestamp. From the
definition, it might appear as though we can (and will) set
event_timestamp to an explicit value, with the current time providing
a default as necessary. But whenever I define a column in this way,
it implies that I never expect to set a value explicitly for this
column. Rather, I am interested in letting PostgreSQL set the
column's value with the current date and time.
</p><p>
Notice how the event_summary and event_location columns are both
defined to be of type TEXT (that is, infinite-length text fields), while
event_start, event_end and event_timestamp are all of type TIMESTAMP,
the SQL-standard way of saying date and time.
</p><p>
All of the columns in this table are defined to be NOT NULL, meaning
that they may not be assigned SQL's undefined value of NULL. NULL
is distinct from true and false, which can make it a bit tricky for
newcomers to understand. However, if you think of NULL as
representing an unknown or undefined value, it might become
clearer. As useful as NULLs can be in distinguishing between false
and unknown values, it's usually a good idea to cut down on them as
much as possible. Indeed, the advice that I have long heard, and
repeated to others, is that you should define columns to be NOT NULL
by default, opening them up to NULL values as the situation requires.
</p><p>
Finally, notice how our two text columns (event_summary and
event_location) are defined both as NOT NULL and with an integrity
check that ensures we enter something other than an empty string.
Whether this combination of constraints is appropriate depends on your
database needs. You might want to think about whether you want to
allow NULL values at all and also if you want to allow empty strings
for the summary and location columns.
</p><p>
Although this simple definition is meant to serve as an example,
consider how much better it would be if we were to have a separate
Locations table, with a location_id and location_name, and then
replace the textual event_location column with a location_id. This
would have the advantage of standardizing location names, which would
lead to fewer inconsistencies. It also would allow us to search for
all of the events taking place in a particular location.
</p><p>
Once we are done defining the table, we add some indexes to our table.
Each index ensures that data will be retrieved from the table more
quickly than usual, at the expense of additional time for each
INSERT. Here are the definitions:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE INDEX event_location_idx
  ON Events(event_location);
CREATE INDEX event_start_idx
  ON Events(event_start);
CREATE INDEX event_end_idx
  ON Events(event_end);
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1282580.0x137aa80"></a>
Inserting New Data</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we have a defined table and indexes, we can start to populate
our database table with some events. We can, as always, INSERT new
events into our table with the following syntax:

<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO Events
  (event_summary, event_location,
   event_start, event_end)
VALUES
  ('Ides of March', 'Everywhere',
 '2005-March-15 00:00', '2005-March-15 23:59:59')
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, the above INSERT statement names only four of the six
columns defined in Events. When we check our new row, we find the
following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
atf=# select * from events;
-[ RECORD 1 ]---+---------------------------
event_id        | 1
event_summary   | Ides of March
event_location  | Everywhere
event_start     | 2005-03-15 00:00:00
event_end       | 2005-03-15 23:59:59
event_timestamp | 2005-04-04 01:20:15.575032
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, event_id (which we defined to be of type SERIAL) has
automatically received a value of 1. Furthermore, event_timestamp has
been set with the date and time at which we executed the query.
</p><p>
It's easy to imagine how we could invoke this INSERT statement with a
Web-based program using CGI or a more advanced system, such as
mod_perl or Zope. Indeed, we really don't have to think much about
how the data has arrived in the database, particularly if we have set
appropriate constraints on our data. We can assume that whatever
resides in the database is reliable, and that the server has rejected
any entries that would violate our rules.

Creating a Dynamic iCalendar File</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we have some activities in our database table, we can
retrieve them into a CGI program. That program then produces
output in iCalendar format, allowing iCalendar clients to retrieve its
data. Listing 1 contains the program, which is a modified version of
last month's dynamic-calendar.py program. As I mentioned last
month, I wrote this program in Python in no small part because of the
relative dearth of modules to create iCalendar-format files.
Fortunately, there is such a module for Python, and I have taken
advantage of that fact in this program.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1282580.0x137ae48"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. db-calendar.py
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

#!/usr/bin/python

# Grab the CGI module
import cgi

cal.add('prodid',
        '-//Python iCalendar 0.9.3//mxm.dk//')

# Version 2.0 corresponds to RFC 2445
cal.add('version', '2.0')

# Create the database connection
db_connection =
  psycopg.connect('dbname=atf user=reuven')
db_cursor = db_connection.cursor()

db_cursor.execute
  ('''SELECT event_id, event_summary, event_location,
             event_start, event_end, event_timestamp
        FROM Events
    ORDER BY event_start''')

result_rows = db_cursor.fetchall()

for row in result_rows:
    # Create one event
    event = Event()

    # Set the event ID
    event['uid'] = str(row[0]) + 'id@ATF'

    # Set the description and location
    event.add('summary', row[1])
    event.add('location', row[2])

    # Transform the dates appropriately
    event.add('dtstart', datetime(tzinfo=UTC(),
              *row[3].tuple()[0:5]))
    event.add('dtend', datetime(tzinfo=UTC(),
              *row[4].tuple()[0:5]))
    event.add('dtstamp', datetime(tzinfo=UTC(),
              *row[5].tuple()[0:5]))

    # Give this very high priority!
    event.add('priority', 5)

    # Add the event to the calendar
    cal.add_component(event)

# Ask the calendar to render itself as an iCalendar
# file, and return that file in an HTTP response
print cal.as_string()

</pre></div><p>
As you can see in Listing 1, the program is fairly straightforward.
After importing a number of modules, we create a calendar object and
insert the iCalendar-mandated fields indicating the source of the
calendar.
</p><p>
We then connect to a PostgreSQL server, which is presumed to be on the
local computer. Although several database adaptors exist in Python
for PostgreSQL access, I have long used psycopg, which is both fast
and stable. To connect to PostgreSQL with psycopg, we use the
following syntax:

<pre     class="programlisting">
db_connection = psycopg.connect
                  ('dbname=atf user=reuven')
</pre>
</p><p>
The above indicates that the database name is atf and the user name
is reuven. You also might need to specify the server and
a password as additional arguments, especially if you are working on a
production system.
</p><p>
Once we have connected to the database, we get a cursor, which
allows us to submit queries and get their results:

<pre     class="programlisting">
db_cursor = db_connection.cursor()
</pre>
</p><p>
With a cursor in hand, we now can send our SQL
query to the database, using Python's triple-quote
functionality to make our SQL more readable. Now we
retrieve our results. If we were expecting to
retrieve dozens or hundreds of rows, we
probably would want to get them one at a time, or perhaps
in batches. But I know that this calendar will
contain only a few events, so I use the fetchall()
method to get them in one large sequence:

<pre     class="programlisting">
result_rows = db_crsor.fetchall()
</pre>
</p><p>
Each element of result_rows is a row from our PostgreSQL database. We
thus iterate (in a for loop) over the rows, retrieving the different
elements that appear.
</p><p>
For the most part, this is pretty straightforward.
However, things get a bit tricky when we are working
with dates and times&mdash;important elements of any
calendar of events! The problem is that psycopg uses
the open-source mxDateTime module from eGenix.com,
which makes working with dates extremely easy. But
mxm's iCalendar module uses Python's datetime module,
which is different. We thus need to retrieve
each of the dates (for the event's starting time,
ending time and stamp), turn them from an instance
of mxDateTime into a datetime-compatible tuple,
use that tuple to create an instance of datetime
and then pass that to event.add, using the three
calls starting with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
event.add('dtstart', datetime(tzinfo=UTC(),
event.add('dtend', datetime(tzinfo=UTC(),
          *row[3].tuple()[0:5]))
</pre>
</p><p>
The second argument to datetime() in the above three rows of code does
exactly what we said. It retrieves one column from the returned row and
turns it into a tuple. We then take a slice of the sequence (with
Python's convenient [0:5] notation) to grab a subset of the items
returned by tuple().
</p><p>
But we can't pass datetime() a sequence; rather, it is expecting a
number of individual elements. In other words, datetime() wants
several numbers, not a reference or pointer to a list of numbers. We
turn the tuple into its individual elements with Python's * operator.
Finally, sharp-eyed readers will notice that we have passed the
tzinfo argument before the individual elements of the tuple; this is
because Python requires that we pass named arguments before the *
operator.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1282580.0x137b478"></a>
What More Can We Do?</h2></div></div><p>
Sure enough, the result of invoking db-calendar.py is a fully
iCalendar-compliant file, suitable for importing into Sunbird or any
other calendar program. Moreover, simply by modifying the contents of
our Events database table, we can ensure that everyone who
subscribes to our calendar gets the latest version.
</p><p>
We can go one step further than this, modifying db-calendar.py such
that it includes only certain events in its result. For example,
perhaps the calendar needs to contain only events in the future; there
is no need to clutter someone's calendar (and bandwidth) with events
from the past. By adding a simple WHERE clause to our SQL query, we
easily can remove all of the events from the past.
</p><p>
More intriguing is the possibility of supporting different groups and
access levels to a calendar. HTTP supports authentication with
user names and passwords, and although Sunbird doesn't support such
protections at the present time, I would expect it (and other
programs) to do so in the future. Given that a CGI program easily
can determine the user name of the person making an authenticated HTTP
request, it's not too far-fetched to say that db-calendar.py could
produce different output for different users, depending on a set of
assigned permissions or roles.
</p><p>
Finally, although we have focused on iCalendar-format
output for the last few months, there isn't any reason
why we can turn only the contents of the database into
an iCalendar file. Indeed, it's quite possible that
we would want to display our events database in plain-old HTML, as well as in iCalendar. Once again, it's
easy to see how we could do that using HTML tables&mdash;demonstrating once again that relational databases
make it easy to display a set of data in a number of
different ways.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This month, we have seen how to use a database to store event
information that eventually will be transformed into an
iCalendar-compliant file. Using a database
makes us not only more confident that stored data is valid, but it allows us to
create dynamically generated files quickly and easily that are suitable for use
in programs that use the iCalendar format.
