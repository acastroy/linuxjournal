We go to press at what we hope is the end of a
nasty brouhaha over kernel development, with Linus
Torvalds finally forced to abandon BitKeeper, his
favorite source code management system, and develop
an alternative. Samba guru Andrew Tridgell developed
a free tool to pull data from BitKeeper repositories,
BitKeeper's Larry McVoy responded by pulling the
free-of-charge version that kernel developers had
been using, and a lot of people's carpal tunnels took
a beating in the resulting&mdash;well let's be nice and
call it a discussion.
</p><p>
Much as we like to find the win-win situations
where we can, people have different goals. Are you
writing a really good operating system kernel, are
you building a proprietary software business or do
you want to keep up with what's going on without
having to accept BitKeeper's non-compete clause?
The Linux business is all grown up in a lot of ways,
moving billions of dollars in hardware, software and
services, but now that we are the IT marketplace, it's
time to be more honest with ourselves about conflict.
</p><p>
Some of us are always going to sound like software
freedom zealots, and some are always going to
sound like greedy swindlers. The answer isn't
to flame the other side with the &ldquo;if you'd just
compromise on my issue, it would be good for Linux&rdquo;
argument. Understand you're in conflict and sell
your alternative as well as you can. Here's where
<i  >Linux Journal</i> comes down on a side that has to be in
opposition to some of the other participants in the
market&mdash;but we're not going to say it's for the
good of &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;, or start flaming when people won't
act against their own interests.
</p><p>
In the long run, we say it's worth a lot of late
nights, hot coffee and risking getting flamed on
a support list to get your organization's directory
service away from a proprietary choice and onto one
of the freedom-friendly, standardized alternatives.
Although you might be able to move some applications
to Linux sooner if you just plug Linux in to your
existing proprietary directory, that is the road to
lock-in. Letting readers get locked in is bad for us
because we're here to help everyone do new, innovative
projects on all kinds of systems, not just whatever
is in the directory vendor's interest to support.
</p><p>
When Craig Swanson and Matt Lung proposed the
now-famous &ldquo;OpenLDAP Everywhere&rdquo; in 2002, it was as
a piece on making your whole business run on Linux.
That's a big subject, so Craig and Matt decided to
narrow the focus. Strangely, they still managed to
cover the essentials for getting your whole company
running right. A lot has changed since 2002,
so Craig and Matt are back on page 40 with a new,
updated version that covers new software versions
and lessons learned.
</p><p>
It's not all controversy this month, though.
The best tools don't force you into hard choices.
Joshua Bentham has an intro to a cross-platform,
easy-to-use way to develop database apps on page 54.
Enjoy the issue.
