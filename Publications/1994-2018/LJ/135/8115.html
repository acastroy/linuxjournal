This information freedom group helped
elect five of the six candidates it supported.
Here's how you can help get Congress interested in
users' media rights.

Balance is the foundation of American copyright and
patent law, but you wouldn't know from looking
at its current trajectory. For the last 100
years, protections for rights-holders have expanded steadily,
usually at the expense of users' rights.
Laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) allow
programmers to be arrested for writing the wrong code.
Other countries have issued travel advisories to their
programmers&mdash;and half-serious invitations to ours&mdash;because American copyright and patent laws have made
coding hazardous. Even worse, the US actively is
exporting these policies by way of free trade agreements
and pressuring countries such as Brazil that embrace
free software. How did our information policy
become so one-sided? More importantly, what can we
do to fix it?
</p><p>
Part of the answer lies in connecting the &ldquo;free culture&rdquo;
movement&mdash;including free/open-source software advocates and
copyright reformers&mdash;to traditional politics. In an effort to establish those links, David
Alpert and I founded IPac, a nonpartisan political action committee that
promotes the public's interest regarding information policy issues. We
all are volunteers, and we have taken a broad, transparent approach to politics,
relying on the &ldquo;bundling&rdquo; of many small donations and blogging our
interactions with candidates. In the last federal election, five of
IPac's six candidates won their races.
</p><p>
IPac is necessary because traditional programmers' rights groups cannot
deal directly with the electoral process. Existing organizations already
take this community's message to the US Congress in the form of lobbying
and activism, but there still is a huge gap in two important areas: money
and votes. Tax-exempt charities such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation
(disclaimer: I work there too), Public Knowledge and the Free Software
Foundation do great work, but they are barred by campaign finance laws
from participating in elections. Because IPac is not tax-exempt, we can
buy advertising, make campaign contributions and mobilize voters to
influence elections directly.
</p><p>
This kind of engagement is vital, because currently the public interest simply
does not figure into the legislative calculus of setting information policy.
In fact, most of the last decade's copyright
and patent legislation, including the DMCA, was
considered so non-controversial that it was passed
by voice vote, a procedure reserved for bills without
real opposition.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, industries that want stronger restrictions have been
supporting legislators generously. According to the Center for Responsive
Politics, the television, movie and music industries gave almost $19 million
to legislators during the last fiscal year. That's a lot of cash, but
we don't have to match it in order to make an impact. The conventional
wisdom in Washington DC is that a candidate's stance on copyright
reform has no bearing on how many votes he or she receives on election
day. Most congressmen don't think that these issues are contentious,
so they don't think about them at all. IPac intends to change this by
associating political costs and benefits with taking a strong stance
on information policy. In many instances, a handful of sympathetic
legislators can derail a harmful bill, so even a relatively small number
of allies would constitute a huge change in the policy landscape.
</p><p>
It is also worth mentioning that Hollywood's $19 million is spread thin.
On average, the representatives supported by the content industry received
only $15,000 during the last election. If your area's open-source
users' groups passed the hat at their meetings, we almost could start
&ldquo;Bearded Sysadmins for Truth&rdquo; and tackle a local campaign head-on. If a
small fraction of those meeting attendees visited their representatives
in person to talk about the importance of free software and copyright
balance, Hollywood would start to get nervous.
</p><p>
For the few legislators who already advocate balanced policy, this kind of
interaction can reinforce their position and help them stay in office.
For others, seeing constituent engagement&mdash;and donations&mdash;can
encourage them to reexamine their policy choices. When we visited
Rep. Rick Boucher, an IPac 2004 candidate, earlier this year, he argued
that much of Congress simply is waiting to be convinced that these issues
matter to the public. The public that I belong to cares deeply about
topics such as the right to program, patent reform and balanced copyright.
IPac can help amplify our voice.
</p><p>
IPac, like open-source development, works best when an engaged community
contributes resources to achieve a common goal. The first real
test of this experiment in user-modifiable politics will be the 2006
midterm election. We already are researching candidates to support,
and eventually we will start the process of putting them in office.
If enough of us move, I have no doubt that the balance will start to
shift in our favor.
