Have you ever been asked to secure a router over which you
did not have administrative control? What about when you are on a
network you don't own but want to secure the segment are you using?
A request similar to this one is what brought me to the wonderful
world of Bridge, the Linux Ethernet bridging project.
</p><p>
According to the Bridge Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Ethernet bridging is a way to connect networks
together to form a larger network. The standard for
bridging is ANSI/IEEE 802.1d. A bridge is a way to
connect two separate network segments together in a
protocol-independent way. Packets are forwarded
based on Ethernet address, rather than IP address
(like a router). Since forwarding is done at Layer 2,
all protocols can go transparently through a bridge.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The code currently is maintained by Stephen
Hemminger for both the Linux 2.4 and 2.6
kernels. Most modern distributions using the 2.6 series
kernel have the bridging code built in. For the
purposes of this article, we are using Fedora
Core 3, which is built on the 2.6 kernel. If you're stuck
with the 2.4 kernel, don't despair. Kernel patches are available on the
Bridge site (see the on-line Resources), so you can play too.
</p><p>
The firewall component of the bridging firewall is
achieved by using another related project called
ebtables. The ebtables program is a filtering layer
for a bridging firewall. The filtering connects
into the Link Layer Ethernet frame field. In
addition to filtering, you also may manipulate the
Ethernet MAC addresses. The ebtables code
also allows iptables rules to function in bridging mode, giving you both
IP- and MAC-level filters for your firewall.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ba580.0x13b2558"></a>
What Is a Bridge?</h2></div></div><p>
A bridge is a device that links two or more network
segments that use the same network technologies. The
topologies may differ, though, so you can go from fiber to
copper, but the technologies must remain the same.
In its most simple form, think of a Linux hub. Add as many ports to the box as you
want, and they all become part of the single
hub device. What comes in one port goes out all of
the other ports in the hub fabric, unless you state
otherwise in the rules. Once your hub is up, you
can use iptables and ebtables to filter traffic as
you would any other Linux forwarding system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ba580.0x13b2660"></a>
Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>
We start out simply by attempting to achieve connectivity between
a simple two-NIC machine. When we are finished, this
Linux box should act as a standard hub, passing
traffic from one port to another as needed. When we
plug one NIC in to our regular network jack and a
laptop into the second NIC, we will be able to use
the network from the laptop as if we were
connected directly.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8172f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. In this simple network, the Linux system
acts like an Ethernet hub, passing all traffic.
</p></div></div><p>
We want this bridge to be transparent to any device
plugged in to it. Interestingly enough, beyond the
ability to connect remotely to the bridge to
maintain it and check logs, there is no
requirement to give the bridge an IP address. Of
course, in today's connected world it makes sense
to assign an IP address and we do so here.
</p><p>
I started with an old box that has been waiting
for a project such as this. It's an AMD K6-450 with
256MB of RAM. It has a single 15GB IDE hard drive and
a single 3Com 10/100MB Ethernet card. I also had a
spare 3Com 10/100MB Ethernet card that works
well with Linux, so it is added as the second interface.
I am going to run only the bridge software, some
simple firewall rules and perhaps Snort for intrusion
detection. The traffic volumes are low and I don't
expect massive amounts of Snort data, so 256MB of RAM
should suffice. If you're going to be passing gigabit
traffic and want to sniff live, ramp up the specs of the
machine considerably.
</p><p>
Now install Fedora Core 3, selecting the extras
you feel are needed. If you work in high-security environments, I
recommend keeping your software options to the bare
minimum. You always can grab extras later with YUM if you
forget something. For now, simply get a working Linux install
going and make sure that it finds your network cards. You need the
kernel source and usual compile utilities to make the ebtables code,
so add those in. Remember to stay secure and remove
any software you don't need once you place the device
into production. Once the install completes, reboot
and log in as root.
</p><p>
Now you are ready to create a virtual network device. You can
call it whatever you want; I went with br0&mdash;the first bridge device:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#&gt; brctl addbr br0
</pre>
</p><p>
Run <tt  >ifconfig</tt>. Do you see your network interfaces (Listing 1)?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ba580.0x13b2b88"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

In Listing 1, you can see that we have two network cards with
no IP addresses bound to them. If you have IP addresses assigned to
the interface, remove them for simplicity's sake. On Fedora, edit the file
/etc/sysconfig/networking-scripts/ifcfg-X, where X is
the card identifier. On my system, the two interfaces are eth0 and eth1.
Delete or comment out the lines that relate to the
IP address. It is important to make sure the cards are
on at boot time. Listing 2 shows a basic
configuration that should work. Don't forget to
reinitialize networking once you've completed the
above, using <tt  >service network reload</tt>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ba580.0x13b2df0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. Two Simple Config Files for Network Cards
with No IP Addresses
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/sysconfig/networking-scripts/ifcfg-eth0:

DEVICE=eth0
ONBOOT=yes
BOOTPROTO=static


/etc/sysconfig/networking-scripts/ifcfg-eth1:

DEVICE=eth1
ONBOOT=yes
BOOTPROTO=static
</pre></div><p>
Next, tell the system what devices belong to this group, as shown below.
Also, give the command that actually initializes the virtual device, as
shown in the last line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#&gt; brctl addif br0 eth0
#&gt; brctl addif br0 eth1
#&gt; ip link set br0 up
</pre>
</p><p>
In its most basic form, your Linux box now is
acting like a hub. For the keen ones, you can
plug in the Ethernet adapters and begin to
play. The box itself, however, currently is
passing traffic blindly and does not have an IP
address assigned to it. I like to be able to
connect remotely to my devices after I install them,
so I am going to add an IP address and some routing
information to the virtual device br0.
</p><p>
To add an IP address to the bridge interface, issue:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#&gt; ip addr add 10.1.1.18/16 brd + dev br0
</pre>
</p><p>
I had to state both the subnet mask (/16) and which bridge device it
should be assigned to. This becomes important if you have more
than one virtual device on the machine. I have only the one, but
the syntax requires it. If you named your bridge device something
else, you need to state that explicitly here.
</p><p>
The last thing to do before you can play
with your bridge remotely is to configure the routing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#&gt; route add default gw 10.1.1.1 dev br0
</pre>
</p><p>
The usual routing rules and commands apply, and for
all intents and purposes you can use the device
(br0) as you would any other Linux network interface.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ba580.0x13b32c0"></a>
Testing
</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we have everything in place, let's test it
out. First, let's confirm that all of our
configurations have taken hold:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#&gt; brctl show
bridge name  bridge id          STP enabled  interfaces
br0          8000.0030843e5aa2  no           eth0
                                             eth1
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see above, we have a single bridge
device called br0 that uses interfaces eth0 and eth1.
This confirms that we should be in business.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ba580.0x13b3478"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Now it's time to do the physical setup. Connect one network card
to your network switch as you would normally do for
any other computer. You should see link lights on both ends of the
link. Connect a desktop or laptop to the other interface on your Linux
box using a crossover cable. Wait for the link lights to
come on, count to ten and ping another node on
your network from your desktop or laptop. You should
be able to use the network on the other side of
the Linux hub as if it was attached directly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ba580.0x13b3580"></a>
Surviving a Reboot</h2></div></div><p>
How you set up your install to survive a reboot
is your choice. A simple way is to add
all of the commands we have used to /etc/rc.local, which is
processed at the end of startup. Enter the commands used above
to this file, and your bridge is functional after startup.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ba580.0x13b3688"></a>Firewalling</h2></div></div><p>
As with any Linux install that passes or
forwards traffic, you have the ability to filter the
stream of information as it passes by. A bridging
firewall is no different. There are many ways to
create and maintain firewall configurations. Below, I explain how to use
the most basic firewall type: deny all, pass some. We want to deny
everything passing this firewall unless we specifically state that
something is allowed.
</p><p>
This firewall configuration requires you to download and install the ebtables
user-space tools available from the ebtables Web site (see Resources).
At the time of this writing, the latest release was
v2.0.6. Grab a copy of this from one of the many
mirrors. Do the usual extract and install dance
without the initial configure step:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#&gt; tar -xzf ebtables-v2.0.6.tar.gz
#&gt; cd ebtables-v2.0.6
#&gt; make
#&gt; install
</pre>
</p><p>
If all goes well, you should have the ebtables
command set at your fingertips. Test this by typing
<tt  >ebtables</tt> at the prompt; you
should see something similar to this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#&gt; ebtables -V
ebtables v2.0.6 (November 2003)
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's start by making sure iptables is set to accept.
Remember we're on Fedora Core 3, so we simply can tell
the service to quit, which does the same thing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#&gt; service iptables stop
#&gt; chkconfig --level 35 iptables off
</pre>
</p><p>
You can do something similar by issuing the flush
command. List your available chains and then flush
each of them in turn:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#&gt; iptables -L
#&gt; iptables -F INPUT
#&gt; iptables -F OUTPUT
#&gt; iptables -F FORWARD
#&gt; iptables -F RH-Firewall-1-INPUT
</pre>
</p><p>
Now we want to stop all traffic from all areas of our
network from passing through the firewall. The
following rules are specific to the network we're
working with for this example; you need to amend the subnets
or hosts to reflect your specific requirements:

<pre     class="programlisting">

/sbin/ebtables -A FORWARD -p IPv4 \
--ip-source 10.2.0.0/16 -j DROP
/sbin/ebtables -A FORWARD -p IPv4 \
--ip-source 10.7.0.0/16 -j DROP
/sbin/ebtables -A FORWARD -p IPv4 \
--ip-source 10.4.0.0/16 -j DROP
/sbin/ebtables -A FORWARD -p IPv4 \
--ip-source 10.5.0.0/16 -j DROP
/sbin/ebtables -A FORWARD -p IPv4 \
--ip-source 10.6.0.0/16 -j DROP
/sbin/ebtables -A FORWARD -p IPv4 \
--ip-source 10.1.0.0/16 -j DROP

</pre>
</p><p>
Those of you familiar with iptables should notice that
the syntax above is similar. We tell the
ebtables program that when FORWARDING using the IPv4
protocol to DROP any packets sourced from the
10.1.0.0/16 subnet. We then tell it to repeat for the
rest of the subnets.
</p><p>
The next step is to allow the device behind the
firewall itself. If you do not allow its IP address to pass
through, nothing works. Also, if you assign an
IP address to the firewall itself, don't forget to
allow it as well:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/ebtables -I FORWARD 1 -p IPv4 \
--ip-source 10.1.1.5 -j ACCEPT
/sbin/ebtables -I FORWARD 1 -p IPv4 \
--ip-source 10.1.1.18 -j ACCEPT
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, I add the devices on my network that are
allowed to access my laptop:

<pre     class="programlisting">

/sbin/ebtables -I FORWARD 1 -p IPv4 \
--ip-source 10.1.10.30 -j ACCEPT
/sbin/ebtables -I FORWARD 1 -p IPv4 \
--ip-source 10.1.10.19 -j ACCEPT
/sbin/ebtables -I FORWARD 1 -p IPv4 \
--ip-source 10.1.10.87 -j ACCEPT

</pre>
</p><p>
To test this, I simply go to a machine listed in the
ACCEPT rules above and see if I can ping my laptop
at 10.1.1.5. Now move to a node not listed above&mdash;no
pings for you!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ba580.0x13aa5f8"></a>
Real-World Implementation</h2></div></div><p>
Recently, I was called to a customer's site to secure
a financial server. The request was simple: we need
a firewall in front of this system but we cannot change
its IP address. With two NICs and a Linux OS, I was
able to have a working firewall up and running in a
few minutes. Installation also was a breeze. I simply used a
crossover cable that connected the firewall to the
server and a regular cable from the other
network card on the firewall to the network jack.
That was it. No redesign was necessary of any part of the
existing IP scheme; it truly was plug-and-play. Once
a few rules were in place to drop all packets unless they
were from the IP addresses and ports listed as acceptable, the
project was completed.
</p><p>
One of the beautiful aspects of Linux is its
ability to run many services on one system. Take the
above example. I quickly firewalled a sensitive
server, but that was not the end of the project. With
all the extra time and money we saved using Linux,
we were able to load Snort on the firewall.
With a quick hack to the sniffer's config file&mdash;/etc/snort.conf in
our case&mdash;we told Snort to
listen to interface br0, and snort immediately began
to do its stuff on the bridging interface.
</p><p>
This is where the true power of the bridging code
can be felt. Ever had a segment of the network running slow
but you don't know why? Next time, load a Linux box with Snort and any other sleuthing
software you like and get the bridge up and running.
Find your trusty crossover cable and head out
to the site. Because the bridge acts like a hub, you simply can insert
your Linux box at any point in the network. As long as you have the
physical connections, you can drop your box in and
begin to sniff live in a matter of seconds. The
latest project we have been working on included
transparent Squid cache servers that are
truly transparent requiring zero reconfiguration
to the IP scheme, clients or browsers. Simply
insert the Squid box in front of the router and
redirect all port 80 traffic to the box
itself and you're done.
</p><p>
The ability of Linux to slide transparently into
existing network infrastructure opens a world of
new and improved services that the penguin can
provide. With the ability to place dissimilar
networking devices into one virtual entity, you
can use a single device to firewall and monitor
any aspect of your network. You're only
limitation is the speed of your hardware and its number of available
slots.
