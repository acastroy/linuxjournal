    Signals are a fundamental method for interprocess
    communication ad are used in everything from network servers
    to media players. Here's how you can use them in your
    applications.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2992580.0x2a8a558"></a></h2></div></div><p>A good understanding of signals is
important for an application programmer working in the Linux
environment. Knowledge of the signaling mechanism and familiarity
with signal-related functions help one write programs more
efficiently.
</p><p>An application program executes sequentially if every
instruction runs properly. In case of an error or any anomaly
during the execution of a program, the kernel can use signals to
notify the process. Signals also have been used to communicate and
synchronize processes and to simplify interprocess communications
(IPCs). Although we now have advanced synchronization tools and
many IPC mechanisms, signals play a vital role in Linux for
handling exceptions and interrupts. Signals have been used for
approximately 30 years without any major modifications.</p><p>The first 31 signals are standard signals, some of which date
back to 1970s UNIX from Bell Labs. The POSIX (Portable Operating
Systems and Interface for UNIX) standard introduced a new class of
signals designated as real-time signals, with numbers ranging from
32 to 63.</p><p>A signal is generated when an event occurs, and then the
kernel passes the event to a receiving process. Sometimes a process
can send a signal to other processes. Besides process-to-process
signaling, there are many situations when the kernel originates a
signal, such as when file size exceeds limits, when an I/O device
is ready, when encountering an illegal instruction or when the user
sends a terminal interrupt like Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Z.</p><p>Every signal has a name starting with SIG and is defined as a
positive unique integer number. In a shell prompt, the
<b  >kill -l</b> command will display all signals with
signal number and corresponding signal name. Signal numbers are
defined in the /usr/include/bits/signum.h file, and the source file
is /usr/src/linux/kernel/signal.c.</p><p>A process will receive a signal when it is running in user
mode. If the receiving process is running in kernel mode, the
execution of the signal will start only after the process returns
to user mode.</p><p>Signals sent to a non-running process must be saved by the
kernel until the process resumes execution. Sleeping processes can
be interruptible or uninterruptible. If a process receives a signal
when it is in an interruptible sleep state, for example, waiting
for terminal I/O, the kernel will awaken the process to handle the
signal. If a process receives a signal when it is in
uninterruptible sleep, such as waiting for disk I/O, the kernel
defers the signal until the event completes.</p><p>When a process receives a signal, one of three things could
happen. First, the process could ignore the signal. Second, it
could catch the signal and execute a special function called a
signal handler. Third, it could execute the default action for that
signal; for example, the default action for signal 15, SIGTERM, is
to terminate the process. Some signals cannot be ignored, and
others do not have default actions, so they are ignored by default.
See the signal(7) man page for a reference list of signal names,
numbers, default actions and whether they can be caught.</p><p>When a process executes a signal handler, if some other
signal arrives the new signal is blocked until the handler returns.
This article explains the fundamentals of the signaling mechanism
and elaborates on signal-related functions with syntax and working
procedures.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2992580.0x2a8a978"></a>Signals inside the Kernel</h2></div></div><p>Where is the information about a signal stored in the
process? The kernel has a fixed-size array of proc structures
called the process table. The u or user area of the proc structure
maintains control information about a process. The major fields in
the u area include signal handlers and related information. The
signal handler is an array with each element for each type of
signal being defined in the system, indicating the action of the
process on the receipt of the signal. The proc structure maintains
signal-handling information, such as masks of signals that are
ignored, blocked, posted and handled.</p><p>Once a signal is generated, the kernel sets a bit in the
signal field of the process table entry. If the signal is being
ignored, the kernel returns without taking any action. Because the
signal field is one bit per signal, multiple occurrences of the
same signal are not maintained.</p><p>When the signal is delivered, the receiving process should
act depending on the signal. The action may be terminating the
process, terminating the process after creating a core dump,
ignoring the signal, executing the user-defined signal handler (if
the signal is caught by the process) or resuming the process if it
is temporarily suspended.</p><p>The core dump is a file called core, which has an image of
the terminated process. It contains the process' variables and
stack details at the time of failure. From a core file, the
programmer can investigate the reason for termination using a
debugger. The word core appears here for a historical reason: main
memory used to be made from doughnut-shaped magnets called inductor
cores.</p><p>Catching a signal means instructing the kernel that if a
given signal has occurred, the program's own signal handler should
be executed, instead of the default. Two exceptions are SIGKILL and
SIGSTOP, which cannot be caught or ignored.</p><p>sigset_t is a basic data structure used to store the signals.
The structure sent to a process is a sigset_t array of bits, one
for each signal type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
typedef struct {
                   unsigned long sig[2];
                }  sigset_t;
</pre><p>Because each unsigned long number consists of 32 bits, the
maximum number of signals that may be declared in Linux is 64
(according to POSIX compliance). No signal has the number 0, so the
other 31 bits in the first element of sigset_t are the standard
first 31 signals, and the bits in the second element are the
real-time signal numbers 32-64. The size of sigset_t is 128 bytes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2992580.0x2a8ace8"></a>Handling Signals</h2></div></div><p>There are many system calls and signal-supported library
functions, which provide an easy and efficient way of handling the
signals in a process. We start with the standard old signal system
call, then we discuss some useful functions like sigaction,
sigaddset, sigemptyset, sigdelset, sigismember and kill.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2992580.0x2a8adf0"></a>The Signal System Call</h2></div></div><p>The signal system call is used to catch, ignore or set the
default action of a specified signal. It takes two arguments: a
signal number and a pointer to a user-defined signal handler. Two
reserved predefined signal handlers are available in Linux: SIG_IGN
and SIG_DFL. SIG_IGN will ignore a specified signal, and SIG_DFL
will set the signal handler to the default action for that signal
(see <b  >man 2 signal</b>).</p><p>On success, the system call returns the previous value of the
signal handler for the specified signal. If the signal call fails,
it returns SIG_ERR. Listing 1 explains how to catch, ignore and set
the default action of SIGINT. Try pressing Ctrl-C, which sends
SIGINT, during each part.</p><p><a href="6483l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Catching and Ignoring a
Signal</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2992580.0x2a8b058"></a>sigaction</h2></div></div><p>The sigaction system call can be used instead of signal
because it has lot of control over a given signal. The syntax of
sigaction is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int sigaction ( int signum,
                const struct sigaction *act,
                struct sigaction *oldact);
</pre><p>The first argument, signum, is a specified signal; the second
argument, sigaction, is used to set the new action of the signal
signum; and the third argument is used to store the previous
action, usually NULL.
</p><p>The sigaction structure is defined as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
struct sigaction {
    void (*sa_handler)(int);
    void (*sa_sigaction)(int, siginfo_t *, void *);
    sigset_t sa_mask;
    int sa_flags;
}
</pre><p>The members of the sigaction structure are described as
follows.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>sa_hander:</b></span> a pointer to a
user-defined signal handler or predefined signal handler (SIG_IGN
or SIG_DFL).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>sa_mask:</b></span> specifies a mask of
signals when the signal is handled. To avoid the blocking of
signals, the SA_NODEFER or SA_NOMASK flags can be used.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>sa_flags:</b></span> specifies the
action of signal. Sets of flags are available for controlling the
signal in a different manner. More than one flag can be used by
ORing:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>SA_NOCLDSTOP: if we specify the SIGCHLD signal,
when the child has stopped its execution it does not receive
notification.</p></li><li><p>SA_ONESHOT or SA_RESETHAND: restores the default
action of the signal after the user-defined signal handler is
executed. To avoid setting the default action, SA_RESTART can be
used.</p></li><li><p>SA_NOMASK or SA_NODEFER prevents masking the
signal. SA_SIGINFO is used to receive signal-related
information.</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>sa_sigaction:</b></span> if the
SA_SIGINFO flag is used in sa_flags, instead of specifying the
signal handler in sa_handler, sa_sigaction should be used.</p><p>sa_sigaction is a pointer to a function that takes three
arguments, not one as sa_handler does, for example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
void my_handler (int signo, siginfo_t *info,
                     void *context)
</pre><p>Here, signo is the signal number, and info is a pointer to
the structure of type siginfo_t, which specifies the signal-related
information; and context is a pointer to an object of type
ucontext_t, which refers to the receiving process context that was
interrupted with the delivered signal.
</p><p>Listing 2 is similar to Listing 1 but uses the sigaction
system call instead of the signal system call. Listing 3 explains
signal-related information using the SIG_INFO flag.</p><p><a href="6483l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Same as Listing 1, but
with Sigaction</a></p><p><a href="6483l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Using SA_SIGINFO and
sa_sigaction to Extract Information from a Signal</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2992580.0x2a8bb00"></a>Sending Signals</h2></div></div><p>Until now, we've been pressing Ctrl-C to send SIGINT from the
shell. To do it from a program, use the kill system call, which
accepts two arguments, process ID and signal number:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int kill ( pid_t process_id, int signal_number );
</pre><p>If the pid is positive, the signal is sent to a particular
process. If the pid is negative, the signal is sent to the process
whose group ID matches the absolute value of pid.
</p><p>As you might expect, the kill command, which exists as a
standalone program (/bin/kill) and is also built into bash (try
<b  >help kill</b>) uses the kill system call to send a
signal.</p><p>Not all processes can send signals to each other. In order
for one process to send a signal to another, either the sender must
be running as root, or the sender's real or effective user ID must
be the same as the real or saved ID of the receiver. This means
your shell, running as you, can signal a setuid program that you
started, but that is now running as root, for example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cp /bin/sleep ~/rootsleep
sudo chmod u+s ~/rootsleep
./rootsleep 40
killall rootsleep
rm ~/rootsleep
</pre><p>A normal user can't send signals to system processes such as
swapper and init.
</p><p>You also can use kill to find out if a process exists.
Specify a signal number of 0, and if the process exists, the kill
returns zero; if it doesn't, kill returns -1.</p><p><a href="6483l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. Programs to Send and
Receive SIGINT</a></p><p>Listings 4 and 4a explain how to use the kill system call.
First, execute the 4a program in one window and get its process ID.
Now, run the Listing 4 program in another window and give the 4a
example's pid as the input.</p><p>This article should help you understand the fundamental
concept of a signal and some of its importance. Try the sample
programs, and see the man pages for the system calls and the
references in Resources for more information.</p><p><a href="6483s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
