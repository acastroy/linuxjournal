Development</h2></div></div><p>Shortly after the kernel's Halloween feature-freeze,
<span   class="bold"><b>Guillaume Boissiere</b></span> decided to put
together some statistics on the incorporation of features into the
2.5 tree. He examined almost the entire history of the 2.5
development cycle, starting in early 2002. He created seven
possible status categories for any given feature: planning,
started, alpha, beta, ready for inclusion, pending inclusion and
fully merged. His first progress chart (Figure 1) shows the
percentage of features in each category. The second progress chart
(Figure 2) shows the actual number of features in each category,
changing over time. Without making any claim to complete accuracy,
the graphs are interesting, if for no other reason than to observe
how seriously most developers took the drive toward feature-freeze.
Note also the hump of work done over the summer, followed by a
complete end to new feature planning. That hump of activity
corresponds roughly to the time when the decision was made to
freeze by November.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6495f2.large.jpg"><img src="6495f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 2. The Actual Number of Features in Each Category
</p></div></div>
</p><p>To facilitate the movement from feature-freeze to actual 2.6
(or 3.0) release, the <span   class="bold"><b>Open Source Development
Lab</b></span> (OSDL) donated labor and equipment to maintain a
Bugzilla bug-tracking database for the Linux kernel at
<a href="http://bugzilla.kernel.org" target="_self">bugzilla.kernel.org</a>.
Support for this was initially strong among developers, but it
tapered off a bit when big guns, like <span   class="bold"><b>David
S. Miller</b></span>, found duplicate entries and frivolous reports
made the system, at least in its original form, more trouble than
it was worth. No one wanted to give up on it, however, and a
concerted effort seems to be underway to bring the bug database to
a usable state.</p><p>In more debugging news, <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> indicated for the first time he might be
willing to accept patches into the kernel to support a
<span   class="bold"><b>kernel-based debugger</b></span>.
Traditionally, Linus' stance has been that real programmers debug
from source files. While not actually explaining the reason for his
change of policy, he now seems to think that a kernel debugger
running across a network would be a good feature to let into the
kernel. Don't look for it in the next stable series, however, as he
was careful to make this statement after the feature-freeze had
passed.</p><p>A new read-only compressed filesystem, along the lines of
cramFS, emerged in late October and targets the 2.4 kernel.
<span   class="bold"><b>SquashFS</b></span> claims to be faster and
to produce tighter compression than either zisoFS or cramFS. The
author, <span   class="bold"><b>Phillip Lougher</b></span>, wanted to
address some of the limitations of other compressed filesystems,
particularly in the areas of maximum file size, maximum filesystem
size and maximum block size.</p><p>And speaking of filesystems, does anyone remember
<span   class="bold"><b>xiaFS</b></span>? In 1993 it was regarded,
along with ext2fs, as a serious contender for world domination. In
fact, the two filesystems leapt into public use within a few weeks
of one another. For a while it even looked as though xiaFS had
taken the lead. By 1994, however, it had essentially dropped off
the map, and a few years later it was actually dropped from the
official kernel tree. In 2000, Linus remarked that it would be fun
to have it back. Finally, just after the Halloween freeze
<span   class="bold"><b>Carl-Daniel Hailfinger</b></span> asked if
this offer was still good. Linus said sure, and even offered to
make an exception to the feature-freeze, if Carl could deliver the
patches.</p><p>&mdash;Zack Brown</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c81580.0x1d7a058"></a><i  >LJ</i> Index&mdash;March

Fora as Art</h2></div></div><p>Setting the mood for this month's issue is our cover
photograph of Mark Hansen and Ben Rubin's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Listening
Post</em></span>, currently featured at the Whitney Museum of
American Art in New York
(<a href="http://www.whitney.org" target="_self">www.whitney.org</a>). This
remarkable installation runs on four computers and as many
operating systems (including Linux, of course) and expresses the
collective voice of the Internet, transforming on-line
communication into a multimedia installation.</p><p>According to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Listening Post</em></span> web
site, &ldquo;statistical analysis organizes the messages into topic
clusters based on their content, tracking the ebb and flow of
communication on the Web. A tonal soundscape underlies the spoken
text, its pitches and timbres responding to changes in the flow and
content of the messages.&rdquo;</p><p>I was lucky enough to &ldquo;view&rdquo; the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Listening
Post</em></span> when it was in Seattle in November 2002, and my
first impression was an almost eerie sense of humanness the piece
unveils&mdash;a poetry not typically associated with computer
technology. In a dark room complete with pillows on the floor, a
wall of tiny screens depict glowing green text gathered in real
time from thousands of public on-line communication channels. These
bits of text are accompanied by a computer-generated voice with a
British accent, randomly speaking different messages as they flash
by. I was particularly struck by the &ldquo;I am&rdquo; series; real-time
messages beginning with the string &ldquo;I am&rdquo; spoken into the
darkness: &ldquo;I am tired.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am happy.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am Norwegian.&rdquo;
Hundreds of people communicating the most basic aspects of
themselves at that precise moment from who knows where to who knows
who, while my imagination worked double time wanting to fill in the
rest of their stories.</p><p>Capturing the ephemeral nature of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Listening
Post</em></span> is difficult; however, Ben Rubin, one of the
creators of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Listening Post</em></span>, best describes
the piece in his artist's statement:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Anyone who types a message in a chat room and
hits &ldquo;send&rdquo; is calling out for a response. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Listening
Post</em></span> is our response&mdash;a series of soundtracks and visual
arrangements of text that respond to the scale, the immediacy and
the meaning of this torrent of communication.
</p><p>Every word that enters our system was typed only seconds
before by someone, somewhere. The irregular staccato of these
arriving messages form the visual and audible rhythms of the work.
The sound-generating systems are constructed almost as wind chimes,
where the wind in this case is not meteorological but human, and
the particles that move are not air molecules but words. At some
level, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Listening Post</em></span> is about harnessing the
human energy that is carried by all of these words and channeling
that energy through the mechanisms of the piece.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Listening Post</em></span> represents the most
significant outcome so far of my collaboration with Mark Hansen,
the only artist I know whose medium of expression is statistics.
Since we began working together, my conceptual vocabulary has grown
to include notions like clustering, smoothing, outliers,
high-dimensional spaces, probability distributions, and other terms
that are a routine part of Mark's day-to-day work. Having glimpsed
the world through Mark's eyes, I now hear sounds I would never have
thought to listen for.</p></blockquote></div><p>Visit the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Listening Post</em></span> web site

It works by keeping your notes in a binary, DBM or about any
Perl-supported SQL back end. Notes can be edited, deleted or moved
into subfolders (topics). Your notes database also can be either in
plain text or encrypted form. This makes it ideal for storing
passwords or other sensitive information. Requires: Perl, Perl
