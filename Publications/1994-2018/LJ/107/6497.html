    The category is hot and huge but still new. Here's a look at
    your choices.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29c7580.0x2abf6b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Name a topic with a community of interest
around it. Now go to Google and look it up. There's a good chance
one or more of the top results will include somebody's weblog (aka
blog). Let's take three examples:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>802.11b: the top listing out of 687,000 results is
WiFi news, a weblog by a pair of journalists, Glenn Fleishman and
Adam Engst. The IEEE working group's site is in the #2 position.
The WiFi Alliance's portal is #3.</p></li><li><p>Segway: the top listing out of 81,500 results is
the Segway company's site, followed by the Berkeley Segway Portal
and then followed by Segway News&mdash;a weblog by Paul Nakada.</p></li><li><p>Weblog: out of 2,620,000 results, the top listing
is Aaron Swartz's Google Weblog, followed by the Guardian Limited's
weblog. Following them is the blog of a certain <i  >Linux Journal</i> editor who also happens to be writing what
you're reading right now.</p></li></ul></div>

</p><p>Blogs succeed largely because they are extremely native to
the Web as Tim Berners-Lee conceived it in the first place. Here's
how weblog software pioneer Dave Winer explains it:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The first weblog was the first web site,
<a href="http://info.cern.ch" target="_self">info.cern.ch</a>, the site
built by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. From this page TBL pointed to all
the new sites as they came on-line. Luckily, the content of this
site has been archived at the World Wide Web Consortium. (Thanks to
Karl Dubost for the link.)</p></blockquote></div><p>Linking to sources and crediting them (as Dave does in that
last line) has always been a native ethical and journalistic
practice on the Web. While big-time broadcasters, publishers and
VC-funded wannabes continue to see the Net as nothing more than a
plumbing system for distributing &ldquo;content&rdquo; to &ldquo;consumers&rdquo;,
blogging software developers have quietly added enormous value to
the linking and crediting functionality of the Web. Dave and other
independent developers have created standards like XML-RPC, SOAP
and RSS, plus open APIs that together turn the Web into a writing
and publishing medium like nothing we've ever seen before.
</p><p>Blogging is not about &ldquo;architecting&rdquo;, &ldquo;building&rdquo;,
&ldquo;designing&rdquo; or &ldquo;authoring&rdquo; anything, because blogs aren't
&ldquo;sites&rdquo; in the usual sense. Blogs are journals. With blogs you
write directly on the Web. Most posts are short, though they don't
have to be. All are topical and current, or they disappear from the
aggregation sites and services and eventually from the
&ldquo;blogrolls&rdquo; of listed favorite links on other blogs.</p><p>Each blog is like a fireplace, and each post is like a log
heaved on top to keep the fire burning. Every post has its own
&ldquo;permalink&rdquo;, so others can point directly to it. As long as a
blog puts out heat and light, others who care about the author's
subject are drawn to it. So are Google and other search engines,
which sift constantly through the ashes.</p><p>At their best, blogs are link magnets as well as sources of
links, which is why Google likes them so much. Google equates
inbound links with authority and ranks the results accordingly.
More links from more highly linked-to pages result in higher page
ranks. That's why so many blogs rise to the top of so many subject
searches. The whole system&mdash;which includes blogs, aggregators, web
services and Google itself&mdash;feeds, builds and grows on itself. It
also attracts and feeds on the RSS streams offered up by discussion
and news sites ranging from Slashdot and <i  >Linux Journal</i> to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>New York Times</em></span>. RSS
is one among a growing number of free and open technologies created
and/or improved by weblog developers.</p><p>As weblogs account for more and more of the traffic in
knowledge about a given subject, they become powerful instruments
for hacking common wisdom. In many categories, they are moving
ahead of mainstream journals and portals and building useful
community services where over-funded dot-com efforts failed
spectacularly. One example from that last category is John Hiler's
Cityblogs, which appeared in December 2002. Hiler explains:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Local sites are caught between a rock and a hard
place: either they hire expensive full-time writers to create
content they can't afford or they fire their writers and turn to
automated content: weather reports, local news and movie listings.
</p><p>It's a Gordian knot&mdash;hire expensive writers or you have no
content&mdash;that blogs are uniquely positioned to cut in two. Now that
I've set up the site, I can cover these three categories in an hour
or two a day. As Glenn &ldquo;Instapundit&rdquo; Reynolds put it at a recent
conference on weblogs, &ldquo;blogging is cheap&rdquo;.</p></blockquote></div><p>So blogging is becoming an option in all kinds of places,
which means there's a good chance that you, as a <i  >Linux Journal</i> reader, fall into one or both of two groups:
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Users who want to set up a blog and start writing
on the Web.</p></li><li><p>System administrators and others with scripting and
programming skills, who are either looking to set up a blogging
system or to manage or change a system that's already in
place.</p></li></ol></div>

To get a handle on both, let's go back to Google.
</p><p>For better or worse, Google is a commercial company whose
services have become de facto web infrastructure. This is
especially true for blogs, which make liberal use not only of
Google's search engine but also of its APIs, which allow automated
queries from programs.</p><p>Google's APIs are part of a growing raft of sites and
services, mostly hacked together by enterprising independent
developers. Technorati (see Sidebar), for example, pays attention
to fresh links between blogs (leapfrogging referrer logs) and
organizes the information into &ldquo;watchlists&rdquo; and other useful
listings. If you want Technorati to tell you who's currently
linking to your blog, you can ask for this information on the site
or pay $5 per year for a watchlist sent out each day by
e-mail.</p><p><a href="6497s1.html" target="_self">The Technorati Story: How a New
Web-Services Product Review Grew Out of a Research
Assignment</a></p><p>Technorati is the creation of this article's coauthor, David
Sifry, who is a cofounder of Linuxcare and Sputnik. It's a good
example of a LAMP program&mdash;one based on the de facto platform of
Linux, Apache, MySQL and Python, PHP or Perl. Another LAMP creation
is Phillip Pearson's Blogging Ecosystem, which keeps two Top 300
lists: one for the most-linked-to blogs and one for the blogs that
do the most linking.</p><p>Both Technorati and the Blogging Ecosystem are made possible
in large part by RSS, the XML dialect whose acronym means really
simple syndication. Thanks to RSS, every story you read on the
<i  >Linux Journal</i> web site is syndicated
automatically to anyone who wants to read and point to it or
aggregate it with other sources.</p><p>The Blogger API is another enabling infrastructure hack. It's
used not only by Blogger (the most popular weblog system, in terms
of sign-ups) but by Radio Userland and Movable Type, the other two
leading weblog systems. This API is what made it possible for one
of your authors to hack methods for posting to various breeds of
blogs through e-mail and Jabber. There are many other hacks just as
there are many other blogging systems. SourceForge alone lists
dozens of weblog systems in various states of completion. In the
LAMP vein, Geeklog and CafeLog are PHP-based and use MySQL, as does
Drupal. In fact, PHP-Nuke, PostNuke, Drupal and Slashcode all are
flexible enough to serve as weblog systems. So is Rusty Foster's
Scoop, which is written in Perl, as is Movable Type. Roller is
written in Java for J2EE environments; in fact, there is a whole
community of Java bloggers. The list goes on, and it's a long one.
So let's break the list down a bit into four family trees.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29c7580.0x2ac0478"></a>Built-for-Blogging Systems</h2></div></div><p>Packages designed from the ground up specifically for
blogging include Radio Userland, Blogger, Movable Type, Greymatter,
Roller and CafeLog. Most include advanced features like the Blogger
API, MetaWeblog API, RSS feeds and subscriptions and XML-RPC pings
to aggregator sites such as
<a href="http://www.weblogs.com" target="_self">www.weblogs.com</a>.
Without RSS feeds and XML-RPC pings, blogs don't get included in
blog-based web services like DayPop, Blogdex and Technorati. You
hear a lot about the theory of web services, but in the blog world
they're easy to put into practice.</p><p>Also falling into this category is LiveJournal, an
open-source project with a large following that puts a high
emphasis on community ties and participation. It's designed as a
centralized system open to many clients on different platforms, all
of which are also open source. While LiveJournal does RSS feeds, it
doesn't make XML-RPC pings to aggregator sites. It also lacks some
of the formatting characteristics one associates with blogs, such
as blogrolls in the margins, all of which makes it less blog-like
than the others in this family.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29c7580.0x2ac0630"></a>Discussion Sites</h2></div></div><p>After the wild success of discussion sites like Slashdot and
Kuro5hin, a number of software packages emerged with Slashdot-like
functionality. Slash is Slashdot's own code base, Scoop is
Kuro5hin's, and mod_virgule is the trust system on which Advogato
is based. These first-generation packages allow you to set up story
posting, site membership, comment moderation, topics or categories
(with icons), polls, post archives and so on. These cover the main
requirements of blogging tools, although many lack more-advanced
functions, such as RSS feeds and XML-RPC pings to aggregators.
Given the essentially personal nature of blogging, even on blogs
with more than one author, features like karma and moderation are
essentially unimportant.</p><p>The growing popularity of PHP invited the second generation
of discussion-oriented sites. PHP-Nuke launched the generation; but
when it went unmaintained, a number of programmers forked the code
base and created PostNuke, Geeklog and PostTEP, among others. This
generation also allows easy theming and better plugin management,
so you can easily write code that might go, say, in a sidebox on
the site to perform a specific task. PHP-Nuke is maintained again,
by the way. This family also includes hybrids like PHP-Slash, which
is Jay Bloodworth's port of Slash code from Perl and mod_perl to
PHP.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29c7580.0x2ac0790"></a>Content Management Systems</h2></div></div><p>Some blogging tools come out of the traditional web site
content management space, including support for multiple authors
and permissions and work-flow enforcement. This is the Vignette
StoryServer tradition, which includes Zope, which is more than just
a CMS, Nucleus and Drupal. Content management sites provide for a
more formalized model-view-controller approach, with clear
separations between content, markup and work flow. These tools
often are ideal for creating dynamic web sites with a lot of
authors and editors, but they tend to lack some of the advanced
features found in blogging tools, such as RSS feeds and XML-RPC
pings. They also lack Blogger and MetaWeblog APIs for posting and
editing content from other non-web browser-based
applications.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29c7580.0x2ac0898"></a>Wikis</h2></div></div><p>Wikis are another way to create dynamic web sites. They allow
anyone to edit and mark up a page easily, while still maintaining
version control. Some blogging tools are based on Wiki code or on
Wiki ideas. These include SnipSnap, TWiki, Tiki, WikiWiki, MoinMoin
and ZWiki. They offer some content management but focus mostly on
ease of editing and posting and speed of updates, neglecting such
blogging functions as dated entries and RSS feeds. Other families
worth noting are the Java-based blogging tools, such as Roller and
WebForum; and Python- and Ruby-based tools, such as Pyblosxom and
tDiary, which is hot in Japan.</p><p>We list all these families because your particular needs may
not be restricted to blogging. But if blogs are what you want to
do, or what you want to support, you need to pay close attention to
what works best for blogging purposes.</p><p>Simply put, your blogging system doesn't qualify for the
label if it can't answer yes to the following questions:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Can a user dynamically post to a site?</p></li><li><p>Are posts easy to create, review and edit again
after they're posted?</p></li><li><p>Can an administrator limit who posts to the front
page?</p></li><li><p>Can a user edit in a browser (at a minimum) or
another tool of his or her choice?</p></li><li><p>Does its page format allow blogrolls and other
sections outside the daily posting area?</p></li><li><p>Does it produce RSS feeds?</p></li><li><p>Does every post have a permanent URL (or
permalink)?</p></li><li><p>Do current posts have unique URLs?</p></li><li><p>Can search engines crawl the archives?</p></li><li><p>Are the archives stable and safe from rot?</p></li></ol></div><p>The big three&mdash;Blogger, Movable Type and Radio
Userland&mdash;qualify on all those grounds, because they were built
from the ground up as pure blogging systems. This is also why most
of the blogs listed in the Blogging Ecosystem's Top 300 lists are
produced by big three tools.
</p><p>We've been experimenting at <i  >Linux Journal</i> with various weblog systems, hosted on a server
kindly provided by Penguin Computing. Most of our efforts have been
focused on Movable Type, which is the only one of the big three
that hosts on Linux and the one that appears to have the most
momentum in the Linux development community. The source code is
available to end users but not under an open-source license.</p><p>Movable Type offers two licenses of its own: a free (as in
beer) one for noncommercial use and a $150 US one for commercial
use. While this disqualifies Movable Type as an option for writers
and publishers, including <i  >Linux Journal</i>, who
prefer to use free software, many blogging organizations that
support the Open Source and Free Software movements, such as the
Electronic Frontier Foundation and Creative Commons, are using
Movable Type.</p><p>So what are your choices here? If you want to put up a
bare-bones blog and don't mind if it doesn't say yes to all the
questions listed above, LiveJournal is a handy and popular choice.
You'll be left outside the Blogging Ecosystem (as roughly defined
by Phil Pearson's aggregation site by that name), but you'll be
using mostly GPLed open-source software and be involved with a
lively community.</p><p>If you want your blog to thrive in the Ecosystem and don't
care too much about what's happening on the back end (just as you
might not care what's behind a Hotmail-type web e-mail system), you
might consider Blogger or Radio Userland. Both allow you to blog
from any server to which you can FTP data and serve HTTP. For
example, to do a Blogger blog, go to
<a href="http://www.blogger.com" target="_self">www.blogger.com</a>, set up
an account, make it point to your FTP server with your user name,
password and web server HTML directory. In Debian the default is
/var/www. On Red Hat, it's /home/httpd/html. This is a simple,
easy-to-set-up blog system and a popular choice&mdash;even for a hacker
who doesn't want to be bothered setting up everything from
scratch.</p><p>If you want a full-featured Linux-based blogging system for
yourself or your organization, and you don't have a problem with
its licensing scheme, Movable Type is your best choice. Installing
it is almost easy enough for novices. It's also extremely flexible,
capable and easy to maintain.</p><p>If platform and licensing issues keep you away from the big
three, you need to look among the discussion site and content
management systems. If you're already using a PHP-based system such
as PHP-Nuke, you might consider adapting your current system or
going to another one in the same general family, such as Geeklog or
Drupal. None are as easy to install as Movable Type, but none are
hard to maintain once you master their methods.</p><p>Command-line tools for blog editing and posting exist on
Linux as well. One example is Philip Myelin's Bzero. Philip also is
the author of the Python Community Server and phpStorageSystem,
both of which are clones of the Userland Radio Community Server.
Running one of these applications on your web server allows you to
host Radio-based blogs on your Linux box.</p><p>If none of the alternatives suits your fancy, you might
consider creating or improving an open-source built-for-blogging
system. Greymatter, which is written in Perl and GPLed, had some
good momentum going until 2001, when Noah Grey decided he had
better things to do. You could pick up where he left off, or you
could build a new blog system from scratch.</p><p>Countless options are available. URLDIR can generate a
variety of feature comparison tables that cover all the systems
listed here and then some. If you're at the tire-kicking stage,
it's a good place to start.</p><p>But don't make a decision before looking at the blogs
produced by these different systems. Follow David Ogilvy's classic
advice to companies looking for an advertising agency: &ldquo;Look for
work you envy, and find out who does it.&rdquo;</p><p><a href="6497s2.html" target="_self">Blosxom: Think of It as cat(1) with
