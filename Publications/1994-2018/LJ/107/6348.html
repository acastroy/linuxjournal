    The Meridius Mail Relay is designed to relay mail in order
    to protect your internal mail server and filter out spam.

rackmountable (1U) Linux-based mail appliance. It is designed to
relay mail in order to protect your internal mail server and filter
out spam. The Meridius is placed on the network between the
Internet and your e-mail server in a DMZ on the Internet or behind
the firewall.

<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6348f1.large.jpg"><img src="6348f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. The Java-Based Management
Console</p></div></div>
</p><p>The hardware specifications are likely to change with
fluctuations in pricing and availability, but the published
specification is an Intel Pentium III running at 800MHz, with a
20GB hard drive and 256MB of RAM with two network ports. The
Meridius is based on several software packages, including Zmailer,
SpamAssassin, Apache and Tomcat. It is managed by a custom
Java-based management console.</p><p>Network configuration, including the IP address, netmask and
gateway, is done with small buttons and an LCD panel on the front
of the unit. The Meridius is then accessed using a browser, where a
web page offers three options: open the management console, install
Java Web Start or read the system documentation (a PDF
file).</p><p>The first-time configuration of mail policies is performed
using a wizard-like tool. The wizard was enough to get a small
organization like mine up and running. The console is used for
advanced configuration, such as routing mail within an organization
or within an ISP. Policies also can be configured to refuse mail
based on IP address, domain or e-mail address. E-mail aliases for
individual users also can be created and maintained in the console.
All of these settings, familiar to a mail administrator as part of
the configuration files, are easily set and modified in the
Meridius console.</p><p>I placed the demonstration unit behind a firewall running
NAT, which caused a few problems that were not immediately
apparent. When I had trouble getting the antispam features to work,
BlueCat's able technical support helped me analyze the logs. There
we determined that all inbound e-mail was coming from the same
address&mdash;the address of our firewall. The Meridius was relaying
mail for our domain properly before we uncovered this problem, but
the antispam features did not work. After we enabled reverse-NAT on
the firewall, the Meridius could see the true IP addresses and
domains of the inbound mail, and the antispam features began to
work.</p><p>We use Microsoft Exchange 5.5 as our e-mail system, so we set
the Exchange server to route all mail to the Meridius and set the
Meridius to route all inbound mail to Exchange. I tested the
Meridius in my organization for over a month in a production
environment. There were no noticeable changes in the speed of our
internet e-mail after the Meridius was added. We receive around 800
messages a day, and the Meridius had no trouble keeping
pace.</p><p>In my early experimentation with the Meridius, I somehow
managed to download the 1.2 system update before I should have,
which caused the Meridius to stop working correctly. The mistake
required me to restore the Meridius from disk, and the system
restore process was straightforward and relatively simple. A
monitor and a keyboard are connected to the Meridius, which is then
powered on with a boot disk in the drive, automatically restoring
the system. It was easy to re-install the settings I had previously
configured, as they are saved from the Java console to a location
the administrator chooses. An update has not been issued since 1.2,
the first update, but I am told updates should go much more
smoothly in the future.</p><p>I had questions about the functions of the device several
times, and the people at BlueCat Networks were always responsive
and helpful. From e-mailing and talking to them, I got the feeling
that they are a small company that cares about releasing quality
products.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12bb580.0x13b3c90"></a>Spamazon.com?</h2></div></div><p>I was most excited about getting the power of SpamAssassin
with Meridius, without going through the learning curve of
installing and configuring. The users, however, were not entirely
delighted when messages with a subject starting with &ldquo;** SPAM &rdquo;
began arriving in their inboxes, with blocks of technospeak at the
top and no human-readable HTML messages. BlueCat Networks was in
the process of releasing a fix (1.2) to restore HTML e-mail. User
acceptance of Meridius' antispam component was probably the hardest
part of installing the appliance. Some users were offended that
advertisements they got from Amazon.com were labeled as spam. I
wrote up some instructions on how to create a folder for spam and
pass anything with the &ldquo;X-Spam-Flag: yes&rdquo; setting into it. I was
happy with the anti-spam performance in my own mailbox. After the
Meridius installation, the signal-to-noise ratio in my inbox
improved significantly. I now have an average of 45 messages
dropping nightly into the folder I created for spam. Meridius made
going through morning messages a breeze.</p><p>I am pleased how simple the Meridius is to administer. When a
user forwards me a message with an address or domain they want
placed on the whitelist, I simply copy the original sender's e-mail
address and paste either the address or the domain into the
console. After running the update process, the new changes take
immediate effect.</p><p>BlueCat Networks is hinting at a lot of improvements and more
functionality to come in new versions of the software, which can be
downloaded. I would like to see context-sensitive help in the
administration console and user-submitted whitelists.</p><p>Does the functionality and usability of the system offset its
$7,000 US price tag? If Meridius is used only for relaying
messages, I think the answer may be no for many organizations. A
lot of administrators could put similar functionality together for
less money. With the Meridius you are paying for good hardware,
support and the administration tool assembled and tested as a
polished product. I believe an organization like ours (about 50
users) is probably on the small end of company sizes that would
make such an investment. Used correctly, over the life of the
device, the anti-spam feature could easily save our professionals
$7,000 US in billing hours. For perspective customers, BlueCat
Networks offers a web demonstration and an evaluation unit of the
Meridius.</p><p>My experience with the Meridius has been a pleasant one. If
you would rather spend your time doing interesting things instead
of sorting through spam messages, worrying about open relays and
administering electronic mail systems, you may find the Meridius is
a good fit for you too.</p><p><a href="6348s1.html" target="_self">Product Information</a></p></div></div>
