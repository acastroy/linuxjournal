  <h3>Blosxom: Think of It as cat(1) with Stylesheets</h3>

  <p>All the heavy blog software in this article might have its advantages, but what if your home page is already a fantastic collation of server-side includes and fun stuff, and you want to leave it mostly as is and add a blog, or two or three?</p>

  <p>What if you're tidy about what software licenses you want to use on your site and think all this &ldquo;free for noncommercial use&rdquo; stuff is a bad flashback to ssh.com, GIFs or Bell Labs UNIX?</p>

  <p>Time to look at Rael Dornfest's Blosxom, which might be described as blogging UNIX-style. The concept is simple. Your blog entries are small text files in a directory of your choice. Blosxom goes through them based on modification date and assembles them into classic date-ordered blog format. That's about it.</p>

  <p>The default format is good-looking HTML, but there's also RSS support, and you can easily write your own HTML &ldquo;flavours&rdquo; to create a custom look. A flavour consists of a head, which is the stuff that goes at the beginning of a blog page; a foot, which is the stuff at the end; and a story section, of which there is one per entry. Samples are available from the Blosxom site.</p>

  <p>The original Blosxom is written in Perl, and there's also a Python implementation, pyblosxom by Wari Wahab; an Apache module, mod_blosxom by Hiroyuki Oyama; and a PHP implementation, phosxom by Stoyan Zhekov. I installed the original, but you can use the same text files and flavours under any implementation.</p>

  <p>Dornfest claims that you should be able to get Blosxom working in 15 minutes, and he's right, if you already have a web server with CGI support. It will work with any distribution's Apache package, out-of-the-box, but if you've tweaked things for maximum security you might have to untweak them to allow CGI. After basic setup, it will take you a little longer if you want to set up permissions correctly for a shared blog. Yes, you can share a blog, using the Linux file permission system you already know how to determine who can write and edit content in which section.</p>

  <p>My Blosxom install didn't stay original for long, because I'm pretty disciplined in how I format my text files, and I wanted timesaving, easy-to-edit blank-line paragraph breaks instead of HTML &lt;p&gt; tags. Then I changed some other stuff, and I was hooked. What's next? Autowriting daily journal entries based on my outgoing mail logs?</p>

  <p>The fun part about Blosxom isn't what it does in that first 15 minutes&mdash;it's what you'll end up doing to yours in the first 15 days. <i>&Aacute; bas les</i> cookie-cutter blogs! <i>Vive la</i> Blosxom!</p>
