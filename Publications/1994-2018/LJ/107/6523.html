SSH I get an error that says &ldquo;Connection Refused&rdquo;. I can SSH on
either machine to itself, but not from another machine. I've shut
off the iptables service, and I've made sure that in
/etc/xinetd.d/telnet the line <b  >disable=no</b> is
present. I've done a <b  >netstat -t | grep telnet</b>
and <b  >netstat -t | grep ssh</b>, and they tell me that
these services are running.</p><p>&mdash;Robert Haack,

so, use a tool such as Nmap to verify that the port appears to be
open end-to-end from one system to the other.</p><p>&mdash;Chad Robinson,
<a href="mailto:crobinson@rfgonline.com">crobinson@rfgonline.com</a></p><p>Look at /var/log/messages or /var/log/auth.log, which should
show you why SSH is dropping the connection. Odds are your machine
checks the reverse DNS mapping for your IP addresses and fails. One
way to fix that is to populate /etc/hosts with the IP and hostnames
of your machines.</p><p>&mdash;Marc Merlin,
<a href="mailto:marc_bts@google.com">marc_bts@google.com</a></p><p>Check the /etc/hosts.allow and add <b  >sshd:
ALL</b> (or the IP address of the remote machine), because
this is probably the reason you can connect locally but not from
another machine.</p><p>&mdash;Mario Bittencourt,
<a href="mailto:mneto@argo.com.br">mneto@argo.com.br</a></p><p>SSH does everything Telnet does and more, and uses
encryption, so you should leave the obsolete Telnet service off.
Especially now that wireless networks are everywhere, you can't
afford to reveal your password on the Net. You're right to use
netstat to check for a listening SSH d&aelig;mon; however, you need
to add the -a option. Do this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ netstat -at | grep ssh
</pre><p>And look for a line that looks like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tcp  0 0 *:ssh  *:*   LISTEN
</pre><p>
to see that sshd is listening for incoming
connections.</p><p>&mdash;Don Marti,
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a></p><p>If the SSH d&aelig;mon isn't running, start it with
<b  >service sshd start</b> or set it to come up
automatically with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chkconfig --level 2345 sshd on

am running the kernel for a single processor the system powers off
normally. If I select the SMP kernel during boot and then shut
down, however, the system will shut down all processes and then

the system power off automatically when using SMP?</p><p>&mdash;Ron Oliva,
<a href="mailto:rmoliva@citlink.net">rmoliva@citlink.net</a></p><p>Power off uses an APM call on Linux, but APM is unsafe in SMP
mode, so Linux disables it. There is one command you give to the
kernel to enable just enough APM to allow for power off. With newer
kernels, add this to your append= line in lilo or grub:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

&ldquo;lights-out management&rdquo; abilities. I currently have several Sun
V100 systems with this capability, but I'm forced to use Solaris.
I've been able to get headless systems set up effectively using
port redirection to a serial interface, but that doesn't fix the
problem of an OS crash or a server that is hung and needs a power
reset or to refresh the OS remotely.</p><p>&mdash;Ron Culler,
<a href="mailto:ron@firelan.net">ron@firelan.net</a></p><p>You need a hardware management card. Many of the major Intel
architecture server vendors, including Dell, HP and IBM offer these
cards as options on their servers. Essentially, these cards are
similar to console redirection to the serial port, except they also
allow you to do other things, such as remotely rebooting or
completely turning off the server. Some of these cards even have
network ports to do away with serial-based communications.</p><p>&mdash;Chad Robinson,
<a href="mailto:crobinson@rfgonline.com">crobinson@rfgonline.com</a></p><p>Some motherboards like the Intel 440GX have a second serial
port that can be used for out-of-band management as you mention
(hardware monitoring, reset and power cycle), and of course, you
can also get BIOS redirection on the other port. To control the EMP
(emergency management port), you can use VACM on Linux,

examining data, using arbitrarily long command strings with
RPN-style syntax. Command recall and editing features, such as
those provided by readline, are essential, and the program has to
run on a graphics screen. I am leaning toward using svgalib because
that will ease the transition from my DOS version and give greater
efficiency in graph drawing, but I will consider other
implementations. Can you give me some general ideas about how to
get my command-line function?</p><p>&mdash;Bill McConnaughey,
<a href="mailto:mcconnau@biochem.wustl.edu">mcconnau@biochem.wustl.edu</a></p><p>Depending on which look and language you're most comfortable
with, you're probably going to be best off with a modern GUI
toolkit such as GTK+ or Qt. There is more code you're going to be
able to borrow there. Also, it's going to be easier in the long
run, as displays get bigger, if you ever want to be able to run
your program and another program on the same screen at the same
time. For example, Ricardo Fern&aacute;ndez Pascual has written
interesting-looking autocompletion functionality for the GtkEntry
widget. His project is called EggEntry and looks general enough to
support entering complex commands. See
