    You can start a blog without getting buried in junk mail.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17de580.0x18d6348"></a></h2></div></div><p>People who are new to on-line communities
are naturally concerned about all the spam they might get. What?
Post your address publicly, for all the spammers to put on their
CDs? It's true, you do start to get a lot of spam if you're active
on publicly archived lists or run a web diary or blog. But don't be
too afraid of spam. A world without spam would be a world without a
lot of other things, too.
</p><p>You could stop spam with one global uniform internet law,
strictly enforced worldwide. But before any such law made any
impact on spam, it would shut down a lot of stuff you like that
your least favorite country convinced the global spam conference to
ban.</p><p>You could change your address constantly and throw away
anything sent to an old address. But there goes your chance to get
mail from new people.</p><p>You could do what some companies and members of the US
Congress are doing and turn the process of mailing you into a
little dance with an automatic challenge that's impossible for
spamware. But apply the Golden Rule for a minute and imagine if
everyone you wanted to write to did that to you.</p><p>A total end to spam would be worse than spam. If you want the
benefits of mail, you're going to have to put up with a little
spam. But how little can you get away with? Gary Robinson is
pushing the limits of automatic spam detection with some
mathematical research on page 58.</p><p>Then, on page 52, Richie Hindle takes a look at how to set up
Spambayes to start marking and filtering your spam right now.
Spam-filtering developers are coming up with new math and new
functionality all the time.</p><p>Sometimes I think Google works as well as it does because Doc
Searls and his friends thoughtfully link to the good stuff on the
Web, thereby pumping up the &ldquo;Google Juice&rdquo; of interesting pages.
How do you become a commentator, tastemaker or diarist? Pick a blog
package and start typing. Naturally Doc and I disagree on which
software is best, but he's the man where blogs are concerned. See
for yourself on page 66.</p><p>On page 72, Marilyn Davis explains that true democracy needs
both elections and deliberation. Most systems offer one or the
other, but not both. However, Marilyn's eVote system makes it
possible for any user of a Mailman-based mailing list to start a
wide variety of single-choice or multiple-choice polls. After the
initial setup, there's no need for an administrator.</p><p>Every once in a while, face-to-face contact is a good idea,
too. Fortunately for us Linux users, there are many ways to meet
off-line and have been since the beginning. Check out the &ldquo;Groups
of Linux Users Everywhere&rdquo; (GLUE) link on the <i  >Linux Journal</i> home page, give your carpal tunnels a break, and
meet some Linux people face-to-face too.</p></div></div>
<div class="authorblurb"><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don
      Marti</b></span> is editor in chief of <i  >Linux Journal</i> and usually
      finds the answer right after he asks a dumb question on a mailing
      list.</p></div>
