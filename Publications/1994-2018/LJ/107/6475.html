    rsync makes efficient use of the network by only
    transferring the parts of files that are different from one
    host to the next. Here's how to use it securely.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bfd580.0x1cf54a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Andrew Tridgell's rsync is a useful
file-transfer tool, one that has no encryption support of its own
but is easily &ldquo;wrapped&rdquo; (tunneled) by encryption tools such as
SSH and Stunnel. What differentiates rsync (which, like scp, is
based on rcp) is that it has the ability to perform differential
downloads and uploads of files.
</p><p>For example, if you wish to update your local copy of a 10MB
file, and the newer version on the remote server differs in only
three places totaling 150KB, rsync will automatically download only
the differing 150KB (give or take a few KB) rather than the entire
file. This functionality is provided by the rsync algorithm,
invented by Andrew Tridgell and Paul Mackerras, which rapidly
creates and compares rolling checksums of both files and thus
determines which parts of the new file to download and add/replace
on the old one.</p><p>Because this is a much more efficient use of the network,
rsync is especially useful over slow network connections. It does
not, however, have any performance advantage over rcp in copying
files that are completely new to one side or the other of the
transaction. By definition, differential copying requires that
there be two files to compare.</p><p>In summary, rsync is by far the most intelligent
file-transfer utility in common use, one that is both amenable to
encrypted sessions and worth taking the trouble to figure out how.
Using rsync securely is the focus of the remainder of this
article.</p><p>rsync supports a long list of options, most of them relevant
to specific aspects of maintaining software archives, mirrors and
backups. Only those options directly relevant to security will be
covered in depth here, but the rsync(8) man page will tell you
anything you need to know about these other features.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bfd580.0x1cf5710"></a>Getting, Compiling and Installing rsync</h2></div></div><p>Because Andrew Tridgell, rsync's original lead developer, is
also one of the prime figures in the Samba Project, rsync's home
page is part of the Samba web site,
<a href="http://rsync.samba.org" target="_self">rsync.samba.org</a>. That,
of course, is the definitive source of all things rsync. The
resources page,
<a href="http://rsync.samba.org/resources.html" target="_self">rsync.samba.org/resources.html</a>,
has links to some excellent off-site rsync documentation.</p><p>The latest rsync source code is available at
<a href="http://rsync.samba.org/ftp/rsync" target="_self">rsync.samba.org/ftp/rsync</a>,
with binary packages for Debian, LinuxPPC and Red Hat Linux at
<a href="http://rsync.samba.org/ftp/rsync/binaries" target="_self">rsync.samba.org/ftp/rsync/binaries</a>.
rsync is already considered a standard Linux tool and therefore is
included in all popular Linux distributions; you probably needn't
look further than the Linux installation CD-ROMs to find an rsync
package for your system.</p><p>However, there are security bugs in the zlib implementation
included in rsync prior to rsync v.2.5.4. These bugs are applicable
regardless of the version of your system's shared zlib libraries.
There is also an annoying bug in v2.5.4 itself, which causes rsync
sometimes to copy whole files needlessly. I therefore recommend you
run no version earlier than rsync v.2.5.5.</p><p>Happily, compiling rsync from source is fast and easy. Simply
unzip and untar the archive, change your working directory to the
top-level directory of the source code, type
<b  >./configure</b>, and if this script finishes without
errors, type <b  >make &amp;&amp; make
install</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bfd580.0x1cf5b30"></a>Running rsync over SSH</h2></div></div><p>Once rsync is installed, you can use it several ways. The
first and most basic is to use rcp as the transport, which requires
any host to which you connect to have the shell service enabled
(i.e., in.rshd) in inetd.conf. Don't do this! The reason the Secure
Shell was invented was because of a complete lack of support for
strong authentication in the &ldquo;r&rdquo; services (rcp, rsh and rlogin),
which led to their being used as entry points by many successful
intruders over the years.</p><p>Therefore, I won't describe how to use rsync with rcp as its
transport. However, you may wish to use this method between hosts
on a trusted network; if so, ample information is available in both
rsync's and in.rshd's respective man pages.</p><p><a href="6475s1.html" target="_self">rsync Works Two Ways</a></p><p>A much better way to use rsync than the rcp method is by
specifying the Secure Shell as the transport. This requires that
the remote host be running sshd and that the rsync command is
present (and in the default paths) of both hosts. If you haven't
set up sshd yet, do that first.</p><p>Suppose you have two hosts, near and far, and you wish to
copy the local file thegoods.tgz to far's /home/near.backup
directory, which you think may already contain an older version of
thegoods.tgz. Assuming your user name, yodeldiva, exists on both
systems, the transaction might look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
yodeldiva@near:~&gt; rsync -vv -e ssh \
./thegoods.tgz far:~
</pre><p>Let's dissect the command line. rsync has only one binary
executable, rsync, which is used both as the client command and,
optionally, as a d&aelig;mon. In this example, it's present on both
near and far, but it runs on a d&aelig;mon on neither; sshd is
acting as the listening d&aelig;mon on far.
</p><p>The first rsync option in the above example is -vv, which is
the nearly universal UNIX shorthand for &ldquo;very verbose&rdquo;. It's
optional, but instructive. The second option is -e, with which you
can specify an alternative to rsync's default remote-copy program
rcp. Because rcp is the default, and because rcp and SSH are the
only supported options, -e is used to specify SSH in
practice.</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly, <b  >-e scp</b> will not
work, because prior to copying any data, rsync needs to pass a
remote rsync command via SSH to generate and return rolling
checksums on the remote file. In other words, rsync needs the full
functionality of the <b  >ssh</b> command to do its
thing, so specify this rather than scp if you use the -e
option.</p><p>After the options come rsync's actionable arguments, the
local and remote files. The syntax for these is very similar to
rcp's and scp's. If you immediately precede either filename with a
colon, rsync will interpret the string preceding the colon as a
remote host's name. If the user name you wish to use on the remote
system is different from your local user name, you can specify it
by immediately preceding the hostname with an @ sign and preceding
that with your remote user name. In other words, the full rsync
syntax for filenames is the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[[<span   class="emphasis"><em>username</em></span>@]<span   class="emphasis"><em>hostname</em></span>:]/<span   class="emphasis"><em>path</em></span>/<span   class="emphasis"><em>to</em></span>/<span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span>
</pre><p>There must be at least two filenames. The right-most must be
the destination file or path, and the others must be source files.
Only one of these two may be remote, but both may be local
(colon-less), which lets you perform local differential file
copying&mdash;this is useful if, for example, you need to back up files
from one local disk or partition to another.
</p><p>The source file specified is ./thegoods.tgz, an ordinary
local file path, and the destination is far:~, which translates to
&ldquo;my home directory on the server far&rdquo;. If your user name on far
is different from your local user name, say yodelerwannabe rather
than yodeldiva, use the destination yodelerwannabe@far:~.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bfd580.0x1cf6318"></a>Setting Up an rsync Server</h2></div></div><p>Using rsync with SSH is the easiest way to use rsync securely
with authenticated users, in a way that both requires and protects
the use of real users' accounts. But as I mentioned earlier in the
&ldquo;SFTP and SSH&rdquo; section [of the book, see Sidebar], SSH doesn't
lend itself easily to anonymous access. What if you want to set up
a public file server that supports rsync-optimized file
transfers?</p><p>This is quite easy to do. Create a simple /etc/rsyncd.conf
file, and run rsync with the --daemon flag (i.e., <b  >rsync
--daemon</b>). The devil, however, is in the details. You
should configure /etc/rsyncd.conf very carefully if your server
will be connected to the Internet or any other untrusted network.
Let's discuss how.</p><p>rsyncd.conf has a simple syntax; global options are listed at
the beginning without indentation. Modules, which are groups of
options specific to a particular filesystem path, are indicated by
a square-bracketed module name followed by indented options.</p><p>Option lines each consist of the name of the option, an equal
sign and one or more values. If the option is boolean, allowable
values are yes or no (don't be misled by the rsyncd.conf(5) man
page, which in some cases refers to true and false). If the option
accepts multiple values, these should be comma-space delimited, for
example, <b  >option1, option2</b>.</p><p>Listing 1 is part of a sample rsyncd.conf file that
illustrates some options particularly useful for tightening
security. Although I created it for this purpose, it's a real
configuration file and syntactically complete. Let's dissect
it.</p><p><a href="6475l1.html" target="_self">A Sample rsyncd.conf
File</a></p><p>As advertised, the global options are listed at the top. The
first option set also happens to be the only global-only option:
syslog facility, motd file, log file, pid file and socket options
may be used only as global settings, not in module settings. Of
these, only syslog facility has direct security ramifications. Like
the ProFTPD directive SyslogFacility, rsync's syslog facility can
be used to specify which syslog facility rsync should log to if you
don't want it to use <b  >daemon</b>, its default.</p><p>For detailed descriptions of the other global-only options,
see the rsyncd.conf(5) man page; I won't cover them here, as they
don't directly affect system security, and their default settings
are fine for most situations, anyhow.</p><p>All other allowable rsyncd.conf options can be used as global
options, in modules or both. If an option appears in both the
global section and in a module, the module setting overrides the
global setting for transactions involving that module. In general,
global options replace default values, and module-specific options
override both default and global options.</p><p>The second group of options falls into the category of
module-specific options.</p><p><b  >use chroot =
<i><tt>yes</tt></i></b>: if use chroot is set to
yes, rsync will chroot itself to the module's path prior to any
file transfer, preventing or at least hindering certain types of
abuses and attacks. This has the trade-off of requiring that rsync
--daemon be started by root, but by also setting the uid and gid
options, you can minimize the amount of the time rsync uses its
root privileges. The default setting is yes.</p><p><b  >uid = <i><tt>nobody</tt></i></b>:
the uid option lets you specify with which user's privileges rsync
should operate during file transfers, and it therefore affects
which permissions will be applicable when rsync attempts to read or
write a file on a client's behalf. You may specify either a user
name or a numeric user ID. The default is -2, which is nobody on
many systems, but not on mine, which is why uid is defined
explicitly.</p><p><b  >gid = <i><tt>nobody</tt></i></b>:
the gid option lets you specify with which group's privileges rsync
should operate during file transfers, and it therefore affects
(along with uid) which permissions apply when rsync attempts to
read or write a file on a client's behalf. You may specify either a
user name or a numeric user ID; the default is -2 (nobody on many
systems).</p><p><b  >max connections =
<i><tt>20</tt></i></b>: this limits the number of
concurrent connections to a given module (<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
the total for all modules, even if set globally). If specified
globally, this value will be applied to each module that doesn't
contain its own max connections setting. The default value is zero,
which places no limit on concurrent connections. I do not recommend
leaving it at zero, as this makes Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks
easier.</p><p><b  >timeout = <i><tt>600</tt></i></b>:
the timeout also defaults to zero, which in this case also means
&ldquo;no limit&rdquo;. Since timeout controls how long (in seconds) rsync
will wait for idle transactions to become active again, this also
represents a DoS exposure and should likewise be set globally (and
per module, when a given module needs a different value for some
reason).</p><p><b  >read only =
<i><tt>yes</tt></i></b>: the last option defined
globally is read-only, which specifies that the module in question
is read-only, i.e., that no files or directories may be uploaded to
the specified directory, only downloaded. The default value is
yes.</p><p>The third group of options defines the module [public].
These, as you can see, are indented. When rsync parses rsyncd.conf
downward, it considers each option below a module name to belong to
that module until it reaches either another square-bracketed module
name or the end of the file. Let's examine each of the module
[public]'s options, one at a time.</p><p><b  >[<i><tt>public</tt></i>]</b>: this
is the name of the module. No arguments or other modifiers belong
here: just the name you wish to call this module, in this case
public.</p><p><b  >path =
<i><tt>/home/public_rsync</tt></i></b>: the path
option is mandatory for each module, as it defines which directory
the module will allow files to be read from or written to. If you
set the global option use_chroot to yes, this is the directory
rsync will chroot to prior to any file transfer.</p><p><b  >comment = <i><tt>Nobody home but us
tarballs</tt></i></b>: this string will be displayed
whenever a client requests a list of available modules. By default
there is no comment.</p><p><b  >hosts allow = <i><tt>near.echo-echo-echo.org,
10.18.3.12</tt></i></b> and <b  >hosts deny =
<i><tt>*.echo-echo-echo.org,
10.16.3.0/24</tt></i></b>: you may, if you wish, use the
hosts allow and hosts deny options to define Access Control Lists
(ACLs). Each accepts a comma-delimited list of FQDNs or IP
addresses from which you wish to explicitly allow or deny
connections. By default, neither option is set, which is equivalent
to &ldquo;allow all&rdquo;. If you specify an FQDN, which may contain the
wildcard *, rsync will attempt to reverse-resolve all connecting
clients' IP addresses to names prior to matching them against the
ACL.</p><p>rsync's precise interpretation of each of these options
depends on whether the other is present. If only hosts allow is
specified, then any client whose IP or name matches will be allowed
to connect, and all others will be denied. If only hosts deny is
specified, then any client whose IP or name matches will be denied,
and all others will be allowed to connect.</p><p>If, however, both hosts allow and hosts deny are present,
hosts allow will be parsed first, and if the client's IP or name
matches, the transaction will be passed.</p><p>If the IP or name in question didn't match hosts allow, then
hosts deny will be parsed, and if the client matches there, the
transaction will be dropped.</p><p>If the client's IP or name matches neither, it will be
allowed.</p><p>In this example, both options are set. They would be
interpreted as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Requests from 10.18.3.12 will be allowed, but
requests from any other IP in the range 10.16.3.1 through
10.16.3.254 will be denied.</p></li><li><p>Requests from the host near.echo-echo-echo.org will
be allowed, but everything else from the echo-echo-echo.org domain
will be rejected. Everything else will be allowed.</p></li></ul></div><p><b  >ignore nonreadable =
<i><tt>yes</tt></i></b>: any remote file for which
the client's rsync process does not have read permissions (see the
uid and gid options) will not be compared against the client's
local copy thereof. This probably enhances performance more
significantly than security; as a means of access control, the
underlying file permissions are more important.</p><p><b  >refuse options =
<i><tt>checksum</tt></i></b>: the refuse options
option tells the server-side rsync process to ignore the specified
options if specified by the client. Of rsync's command-line
options, only checksum has an obvious security ramification. It
tells rsync to calculate CPU-intensive MD5 checksums in addition to
its normal rolling checksums, so blocking this option reduces
certain DoS opportunities. Although the compress option has a
similar exposure, you can use the dont compress option to refuse it
rather than the refuse options option.</p><p><b  >dont compress =
<i><tt>*</tt></i></b>: you can specify certain
files and directories that should not be compressed via the dont
compress option. If you wish to reduce the chances of compression
being used in a DoS attempt, you also can specify that nothing be
compressed by using an asterisk (*), as in our example.</p><p>This simple example should get you started offering files for
download by rsync. Next month, we'll cover setting up rsync modules
(directories) at the filesystem level to accept anonymous uploads
and authenticate users.</p><p><a href="6475s2.html" target="_self"><span   class="emphasis"><em>Building Secure Servers
