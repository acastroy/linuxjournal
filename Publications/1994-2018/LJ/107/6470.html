[<i  >LJ</i>, December 2002]. I was just curious about
one point. You make a comment about not being able to configure the
acceptable commands list differently for internal and external
users. Is it possible to set up two proxies then route the incoming
requests at the firewall for internal addresses to one proxy and
those from external addresses to the other?</p><p>&mdash;John</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mick Bauer replies:</b></span> That's
an excellent idea! You could set up a proxy on the firewall for
external users, with read-only permissions, and set up a proxy on
some host on the inside for outbound transactions, with looser
permissions. You could then configure your firewall to permit
outbound FTP only if it originates from the designated internal
proxy.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1248580.0x13409d0"></a>Acronym Recycling Department</h2></div></div><p>It's great to see those huge old machines coming back! I saw

use Freon to cool it. And software is coming back! SOAP, for

applications and yet when it came to mapping/navigation software
you listed only the free one. zNav and zNav Lite are the only

MooView [<i  >LJ</i>, January 2003], you completely
leave out the point that MooView cannot handle even reasonably
sized files, just like the included image viewer, while tkcGallery
can handle virtually any size image. I've tested up to ten
megapixels so far. The general feeling here is that if it is a
commercial app you must make some negative mention, and if it is
free then there must be nothing wrong with it.</p><p>&mdash;Shawn Gordon, President, theKompany.com</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guylhem P. Aznar responds:</b></span> I
just could not recommend every single application. Yes, I did
mention the problems I had and the existing free software

<i  >LJ</i></h2></div></div><p>Somehow I managed to forget to bring reading material for my
Thanksgiving flight, so I found myself looking through the junk
that the airports had to offer. My brother said I should get a
magazine but I refused to pay five bucks for something without
content. I returned home to my latest <i  >Linux Journal</i>. In every issue you folks manage to cram lots of
good stuff onto those pages. So many computer magazines are more
like bridal zines, to be purchased only when one is in the market
for something new. <i  >Linux Journal</i>, on the other
hand, puts together great articles for people who actually use the
machines they own. So I just wanted to send out a thanks. Some days
I think your organization is the only place that has a clue as to
what people want.</p><p>&mdash;Tim</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1248580.0x173a068"></a>Thumbs-up on Bluecurve</h2></div></div><p>I have to disagree with the comments made by Tom Amon in your
January 2003 Letters section (entitled &ldquo;Red Hat 8.0: Love the
License, Hate the Look&rdquo;). Red Hat has made an attempt to bring
forward a &ldquo;best of breed&rdquo; desktop. Having KDE (or GNOME if you
wish) pre-setup with Mozilla, Evolution and OpenOffice seemed, to
me, a vast improvement over the 7.3 release. I'll concur with Tom
that the result is not perfect (where did Xine go, Red Hat?), but
this is a road I would like Red Hat to stay on.</p><p>&mdash;Timothy J Halloran, Carnegie Mellon University</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1248580.0x173a1c8"></a>Hooray for Zaurus and <i  >LJ</i>

various hardware and software options are available
[<i  >LJ</i>, January 2003]. The Zaurus is a system
that can stand on its own, and more articles on it would be
welcome. I can also say that I find the advertising in your
magazine an excellent resource of what's available in the Linux
world.</p><p>&mdash;Julian Macassey</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1248580.0x173a3d8"></a>Why Java without the VM?</h2></div></div><p>The author of &ldquo;Compiling Java with GCJ&rdquo;
[<i  >LJ</i>, January 2003] misses the point of what
makes Java a more viable solution than any natively compiled
language, namely, platform neutrality &aacute; la the Virtual
Machine. Simply put, natively compiling Java defeats the primary
purpose of why Java was invented in the first place. I compile GIS
Java code once on Linux and run that same code on Mac OS X, AIX,
Solaris and more, with great success and eye-popping performance. A
key Java goal is to limit the long development cycle time of
software by avoiding native porting overhead.</p><p>&mdash;Bryan McKinley</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1248580.0x173a590"></a>Rackspace vs. Spam Blacklists</h2></div></div><p>On page 15 of the January 2003 <i  >Linux Journal</i> you have a full-page ad from Rackspace. I would
advise anybody looking for hosting NOT to go to Rackspace. They are
well known for hosting spammers. The &ldquo;100% network uptime&rdquo; they
boast about in the ad does you no good if your class C is
blackholed due to the spammers you share it with. I would advise
anybody seeking hosting to closely check the anti-spamming
resources before contracting for hosting.</p><p>&mdash;David D. Hagood</p><p>Likewise, you should check out any spam-filtering service you
plan to use to see how much legitimate mail gets blocked because of
who the sender's network neighbors are. The
<a href="/" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com</a> web site is at
Rackspace, and it works fine for us.</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1248580.0x173a850"></a>Go on, Take the Microsoft Ad</h2></div></div><p>I enjoyed both Renato Carrara's letter in the December 2002
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, and Gary Nickerson's reply in
the January 2003 issue. I don't think that it's necessarily
dangerous for a (relatively) small-circulation publication like
<i  >Linux Journal</i> to sell advertising to
Microsoft; Bill's money is just as green as anyone else's. However,
as a publication grows, it needs to beware of developing a
dependency on large, powerful advertisers such as Microsoft. High
overhead can make them susceptible to the threat (explicit or
unstated) of one or more large advertisers pulling their ads. I
hope that <i  >LJ</i> can grow at a measured pace and
thus maintain its independent spirit and its outstanding content.
In the meantime, I appreciate your great work in building a very
useful and readable publication. Please keep it up. And, hey, if
you're able to siphon off a few bucks from The Beast along the way,
more power to ya.</p><p>&mdash;Ken</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1248580.0x173aab8"></a>Thanks for Not Taking the Microsoft Ad</h2></div></div><p>Regarding the letter &ldquo;An Ad Is an Ad&rdquo; in the January 2003
issue, I think the decision not to run ads from Microsoft is a
great one. If I need information from them I know exactly where to
find it. The ads in <i  >Linux Journal</i> nowadays are
really a welcomed break from other &ldquo;infested&rdquo; publications. I
think it's really important that you guys keep your focus on the
values of where you came from, since it really makes a big
difference for us readers. Truly, it's a joy to read your magazine,
all the fresh people and talk and the lack of all the corporate
bull.</p><p>&mdash;Boris Debic, San Mateo, California</p></div></div>
