  <h3>Many Possibilites: eVote's Poll Types</h3>

  <p>In the e-mail interface, the voter sends the following line to the list address for a yes-or-no vote where the participants can see other's votes and where the vote tally is visible to all as the vote develops:</p>
  <pre>
eVote poll [y/n] public visible
</pre>

  <p>eVote must be the first word in the message, otherwise the command is sent to the whole list and is ignored by eVote. <b>poll</b> is the command to set up a new poll.</p>

  <p>Votes can be numeric or yes/no. The vote limits are in brackets ([ ]) first. 119 is the highest vote possible; -119 is the lowest, and [y/n] means a yes or no vote.</p>

  <p><b>public</b> is for a show of hands; in other words, list members can query eVote to see other members' votes. <b>private</b> takes a secret vote. <b>if_voted</b> lets participants see if others voted but not how.</p>

  <p><b>Grouped Vote Types</b></p>

  <p>The community can be asked to choose one of many options. The command might be:</p>
  <pre>
eVote poll group public visible 1
1.  bittersweet  [y/n]
2.  bittersweet with almonds  [y/n]
3.  milk [y/n]
4.  milk with almonds [y/n]
Message:
Which chocolate would you like?
</pre>

  <p>The keyword group indicates that there are several choices. The 1 at the end of the command line restricts the voters to choosing only one item.</p>

  <p>Next comes the list of choices. Each choice is followed by the vote limits for that choice. Last comes the message, keyword and the text associated with the poll.</p>

  <p>Here's a more complicated example:</p>
  <pre>
eVote poll group public visible 100
1.  building maintenance [2,4]
2.  system maintenance  [10,15]
3.  staff [20,40]
4.  development [0,50]
5.  outreach [0,50]
6.  party [0,50]
Message:
Please help spend our budget. We'll distribute
our funds according to the average of all our votes.
</pre>

  <p>This poll asks voters to distribute 100 votes over six choices.</p>Different choices have different minimum and maximum votes.

  <p>When such a poll is initiated by one member, all the members receive polling instructions, as follows:</p>
  <pre>

====== ====
PUBLIC POLL
====== ====

This is a "public" poll. This means you can send
e-mail to



with the subject, "Budget", and with
a message that says:

         eVote who

to receive a spreadsheet showing everyone's votes.

         eVote who w=140

will produce a spreadsheet 140 columns wide.
The default is 80.

Of course, everyone else on the democracy list
can monitor your votes too.

== ====
TO VOTE
== ====

 | 1.  Send a message to
 |
 | 2.  Your subject must be "Budget".
 |     (Don't worry about extra words in the subject line that
 |      reply-to produces.)
 |
 |      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  ----&gt; *  NOTE:  These two steps are easy. Just use  *
        *         your reply-to key on this message!  *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

   3.  Your message *must* start with the word, 'eVote',
       or your vote will be sent to the entire democracy list
       and it won't be counted!

       To vote 12 on choice 2 and 25 on choice 6,
       your message should say:

          eVote
          2. 12
          6. 25

       You can make your list of votes as long as
       necessary.
       Each choice that you don't vote on will
       automatically receive
       the minimum vote for that choice.

   4.  If your message has a signature, or any other
       text below your vote, make a line that says,
       "end" just after your vote.

  <p><b>Petition Types</b></p>

  <p>Any of the above poll types can be attached to a petition that allows participation from people who are not on the e-mail list. Petitions invite a comment in addition to a vote.</p>

  <p><b>Future Poll Types</b></p>

  <p>The Clerk is architected to allow the addition of other poll types. Some interesting possibilities are described at <a href="http://www.michcom/~donald/dispute.html">www.michcom/~donald/dispute.html</a> and <a href="http://accuratedemocracy.com/a_map.htm">accuratedemocracy.com/a_map.htm</a>.</p>
