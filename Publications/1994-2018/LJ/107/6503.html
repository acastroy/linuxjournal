    Will the US government ban free device drivers for
    TV-capable hardware?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1452580.0x154a5b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(DMCA) gave copyright holders powerful new rights to control
implementations of proprietary protocols and media formats. Yet, it
took a hands-off position toward non-proprietary formats. You still
are free under the DMCA to implement a system based on open
standards with the features of your choice.
</p><p>But now, even this &ldquo;no mandate&rdquo; rule is under attack from
proposals to regulate the use of open standards. The best-known is
the Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act
(CBDTPA), introduced by Sen. Ernest Hollings. CBDTPA goes beyond
the DMCA and requires that any &ldquo;digital media device&rdquo; must
include &ldquo;standard security technologies&rdquo;.</p><p>The CBDTPA has been criticized from many directions. But
entertainment industries have effectively split it into a series of
more palatable pieces. The Motion Picture Association of America
(MPAA) has spent the past year pursuing three new regulatory
measures:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>A &ldquo;broadcast flag&rdquo; mandate for all devices that
can receive digital television broadcasts.</p></li><li><p>An &ldquo;analog hole&rdquo; watermark-detection mandate for
&ldquo;all devices that perform analog-to-digital conversions&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p>An unspecified technology mandate for peer-to-peer
file-sharing software.</p></li></ol></div><p>None of these measures, individually, is as drastic as the
CBDTPA. Mandates can be imposed gradually; technology industries
may not launch an all-out campaign against any particular measure.
Tech vendors may be divided and choose not to oppose measures that
don't affect them directly.
</p><p>MPAA's lobbying for a &ldquo;broadcast flag&rdquo; mandate is already
underway. This proposal is specific to US terrestrial digital
television broadcasts. But it's the first part of a larger
regulatory agenda that needs to be stopped now&mdash;movie studios
should have less, not more, control over our technology.</p><p>Current-generation US television broadcasts use the
50-year-old analog NTSC transmission standard. In 1996, the US
adopted a plan to replace NTSC gradually with a next-generation
digital standard, ATSC, capable of carrying high-definition TV
pictures. This transition was meant to finish around 2006 with the
complete discontinuation of analog TV broadcast. Meanwhile,
stations are broadcasting both analog and digital TV signals (using
additional channels lent to them by the government). ATSC-capable
home theater equipment and PC adapters are now available. The
transition is underway.</p><p>ATSC is an open standard, and terrestrial broadcasts using it
are always unencrypted. Therefore, the DMCA does not restrict the
kinds of features that can be included in an ATSC receiver.
Hollywood studios have begun to complain that this means ATSC
broadcasts are too insecure for transmission of Hollywood
movies&mdash;if anybody can build a receiver, the movies could be used
in ways the studios might wish to prevent.</p><p>The studios have argued that the &ldquo;insecurity&rdquo; of ATSC
receivers is deterring them from licensing their movies for ATSC
broadcast. They regularly license their movies for unencrypted NTSC
broadcast, but the superior quality of ATSC purportedly makes it a
more attractive target for copyright infringement. Instead of
encrypting the broadcasts, however, the studios have proposed new
legal restrictions that limit how a TV signal can be used on
receiving devices. According to the studios' proposal, the TV
receiver, whether hardware or software, would have to be
&ldquo;compliant&rdquo; and &ldquo;robust&rdquo; against modification by an end
user.</p><p>Instead of encryption, the proposed measure is merely a label
or header akin to an e-mail header defined to signal
&ldquo;technological control of consumer redistribution&rdquo;. Such a
measure is no more effective than an &ldquo;X-No-Forward:&rdquo; e-mail
header, but a law or regulation could deem it illegal to fail to
honor such a header.</p><p>This regulation leads us away from a world where people are
free to implement open standards as they choose. ATSC has been such
a standard, but the benefits of its openness, including support by
free software, could be lost.</p><p>&ldquo;Compliance&rdquo; requirements limit permissible outputs to a
short list of restricted formats, implementations of which are
subject, in turn, to DMCA restrictions. Open standards need not
apply. This creates a tremendous incentive for consumer electronics
manufacturers to implement proprietary technologies. Open
interfaces, which one studio representative referred to as &ldquo;legacy
interfaces&rdquo; because they lack copy controls, would suffer a
substantial competitive disadvantage.</p><p>&ldquo;Robustness&rdquo; requirements prevent programmers from
developing free drivers for ATSC, such as the free drivers already
being developed for ATSC tuner cards. They also would ban free
software implementations of ATSC, such as FSF's GNU Radio Project,
which interprets radio signals in software. If software can be
modified by an end user, it can't be trusted to control how users
use it&mdash;the same argument the MPAA uses against the development of
free DVD players. The broadcast flag rules could result in a ban on
certain kinds of free software specifically because that software
can be modified by end users.</p><p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is now
considering whether to mandate that TV-receiving equipment comply
with these rules.</p><p>EFF is fighting this proposal and recently filed comments
with the FCC against it. We attended all the meetings of the
Broadcast Protection Discussion Group where the proposal was
developed. With our &ldquo;Consensus At Lawyerpoint&rdquo; web site, we've
tried to fill the information vacuum surrounding the broadcast flag
issue. (Reporters were barred from meetings, which had a
$100-per-meeting admission fee.)</p></div></div>
