In my previous two columns, I began a series on building Linux-based
Virtual Private Network (VPN) solutions using OpenVPN. When I left off
last time, I had gotten as far through the OpenVPN server configuration
process as creating a simple Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), using it
to generate server and client certificates, and creating a few other
&ldquo;support&rdquo; files involved in building OpenVPN tunnels. In so doing,
I worked my way down just the first third or so of the example
OpenVPN server configuration, but those PKI/crypto-related configuration
parameters represent the most complicated part of OpenVPN configuration
tasks.
</p><p>
This month, I describe the rest of that server configuration file
and show a corresponding OpenVPN client configuration file (which I'll
dissect next month). I also show how to start both server and client
processes, although debugging, firewall considerations and other finer
points also will need to wait until my next column.
</p><p>
Have no fear&mdash;I think you'll find this installment to be plenty
action-packed in its own right. Let's get to it!

OpenVPN Server Configuration, Continued</h2></div></div><p>
Normally at this point in a multipart series, I'd review at least some
details from the prior month's column, but that won't work this time.
Last month's article covered a lot of ground, and this month's needs to
cover still more. Suffice it to say that I began dissecting an example
OpenVPN server configuration file, /etc/openvpn/server.ovpn (Listing 1).
</p><p>
I got as far as generating the files referenced in the
<tt  >ca</tt>, <tt  >cert</tt>,
<tt  >key</tt>, <tt  >dh</tt> and
<tt  >tls-auth</tt> lines, using a
combination of OpenVPN &ldquo;easy-rsa&rdquo; helper scripts (located in
/usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/easy-rsa/2.0) and the commands openvpn
and openssl. I'm going to continue describing Listing 1's parameters,
assuming that the aforementioned certificate, key and other helper
files are in place.

So, having set up the basic port/protocol/device settings and
cryptography-related settings, let's move on to settings that will
determine what happens once a client successfully establishes an
authenticated, encrypted tunnel. The first such setting is
<tt  >server</tt>.
</p><p>
<tt  >server</tt> actually is a helper directive. It expands to an entire
block of other parameters. Rather than slogging through all those
additional parameters, let's just say that the server directive
takes two parameters: a network address and a netmask. For each tunnel
established by clients on the port we specified earlier, the OpenVPN
server process will carve a little 30-bit subnet from the specified IP
space, assign itself the first host IP address in that subrange as its
local tunnel endpoint and assign the other host IP in the 30-bit subnet
to the connecting client as its remote tunnel endpoint.
</p><p>
In the example, I've specified the network address 10.31.33.0 with a
netmask of 255.255.255.0, which translates to the range of IP addresses
from 10.31.33.1 to 10.31.33.254. When the first tunnel is established,
the server will use 10.31.33.1 as its local tunnel endpoint address and
assign 10.31.33.2 to the client to use as the remote tunnel endpoint
address. (10.31.33.0 is that subnet's network address, and 10.31.33.3
is its broadcast address.)
</p><p>
For the next client to connect, the server will use 10.31.33.5 as
its tunnel endpoint and will assign 10.31.33.6 as the client's tunnel
endpoint (with 10.31.33.4 and 10.31.33.7 as network and broadcast addresses,
respectively). Get it?
</p><p>
This isn't the most efficient use of an IP range. The server needs a
different local IP address for <span   class="emphasis"><em>each</em></span> tunnel it builds, and for
each tunnel, the server essentially wastes two others (for network and
broadcast addresses). Preceding the server directive with the line
<tt  >topology subnet</tt> will cause the server to use the
first IP in its <tt  >server
[network address] [netmask]</tt> range for its local tunnel IP for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>
tunnels and for client tunnel-endpoint IPs to be allocated from the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>entire</em></span> remainder of possible IPs in that range, as though all
remote tunnel endpoints were IP addresses on the same LAN.
</p><p>
This isn't the default behavior, because it's new to OpenVPN 2.1. The
&ldquo;subnet&rdquo; topology isn't supported by earlier versions or by Windows
clients using version 8.1 or lower of the TAP-Win32 driver. Note that
if undeclared (as in Listing 1), the <tt  >topology</tt> parameter has a default
value of <tt  >net30</tt>, which results in server's specified IP range being
split up into 30-bit subnets as described above.
</p><p>
Continuing on in Listing 1, next comes
<tt  >ifconfig-pool-persist</tt>, which
specifies a file in which to store associations between tunnel clients'
Common Names (usually their hostnames, as specified in their respective
client certificates) and the IP addresses the server assigns to their
tunnels. Although this doesn't guarantee a given client will receive
the same tunnel IP every time it connects, it does allow clients to use
the <tt  >--persist-tun</tt> option in their client configurations, which keeps
tunnel sessions open across disruptions in service (OpenVPN server d&aelig;mon
restarts, network problems and so forth).
</p><p>
Next comes the statement <tt  >push "redirect-gateway def1
bypass-dhcp"</tt>. The
<tt  >push</tt> directive causes the subsequent double-quotation-mark-enclosed
string to be run on the client as though it was part of the client's
local configuration file. In this case, the server will push the
<tt  >redirect-gateway</tt> parameter to all clients, with the effect that each
time a client connects, the client's local default gateway, DNS servers
and other network parameters normally provided by DHCP will be overridden
by the server's settings for those things.
</p><p>
This effectively enforces a VPN policy of &ldquo;local-subnet-only split
tunneling&rdquo;. For those of you new to VPNs, a split tunnel configuration
is one in which clients can use their VPN tunnels to connect to some
things and their local (non-tunneled) Internet connection to connect
to other things.
</p><p>
As I've said in previous columns though, forcing clients to use the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>remote</em></span> network's infrastructure (DNS servers, Internet uplink and so forth) makes it much harder for attackers connected to a client's
local network, which might be an untrusted environment like a coffee-shop wireless hotspot, to perform various kinds of eavesdropping,
session-hijacking and man-in-the-middle attacks.
</p><p>
Even with this setting, a client still will be <span   class="emphasis"><em>able</em></span> to connect
to some things on the local network. It just won't be able to use
it as a <span   class="emphasis"><em>route</em></span> for anything but connecting back to your OpenVPN
server. Again, it's good policy to configure clients to leverage as much
of your trusted network's infrastructure as possible.
</p><p>
After the <tt  >push "redirect-gateway..."</tt> directive comes
<tt  >keepalive 10
120</tt>. Like <tt  >server</tt>,
<tt  >keepalive</tt> is a helper directive that expands to a
list of other parameters. Again for the sake of brevity, let me summarize
the effect of the example line: every ten seconds, the server will check
to see that each client is still connected, and if no reply is received
from a given client over any 120-second period, it will assume that client
is unreachable at its last known IP address.
</p><p>
For example, if the server sends a query to a particular tunnel client
at 9:00:00 and gets a reply, but another at 9:00:10 to which there's
no reply, and also receives no reply to any of 11 more queries
sent out at 9:00:20, 9:00:30 and so on until 9:02:00, then at 9:02:00
(after 120 seconds of no replies), the server will conclude the client
system is unreachable.
</p><p>
At this point, the server will attempt to re-resolve the remote client's
name, on the assumption that its IP address may have changed (due to DHCP
lease renewal, for example) and, thus, re-establish the tunnel session.
</p><p>
The aforementioned infrastructure settings, such as DNS servers, by the
way, will be read by the server's openvpn process from /etc/resolv.conf,
the server's running routing table and so forth&mdash;no OpenVPN
configuration parameters are necessary for those settings unless you want
them to be different from the server's. (For now, let's assume you don't!)
</p><p>
I just spent a fair amount of ink on only a handful of settings. But
I think this is warranted given that <tt  >server</tt> and
<tt  >keepalive</tt> are
helper directives that expand to many more settings and given that
we're now done with the network configuration portion of our server
configuration.
</p><p>
The next parameter is a simple one: <tt  >cipher BF-CBC</tt>, which specifies that
each tunnel's data payload will be encrypted with the Blowfish cipher,
using 128-bit keys, in Cipher Block Chaining mode (CBC mode makes it
harder for an attacker to brute-force-decrypt isolated parts of a given
session). BF-CBC is the default setting for <tt  >cipher</tt>,
so technically,
I don't need to specify this, but it's an important setting. You can
use the command <tt  >openvpn --show-ciphers</tt> to see a list of all supported
cipher values and their default key sizes.
</p><p>
<tt  >comp-lzo</tt> is even simpler. It tells OpenVPN to compress all session
data using the LZO compression algorithm, unless a given portion of data
appears to be compressed already (for example, if a JPEG image or a ZIP
file is being transferred), in which case OpenVPN won't compress until it
detects a return to noncompressed session content. This adaptive behavior
helps minimize the data padding that results from trying to compress
already-compressed data. Because LZO is a fast algorithm, this is a good
setting. Its cost in CPU overhead is generally more than compensated for by
the amount of network bandwidth (and, thus, other CPU cycles) it conserves.
</p><p>
The next setting, <tt  >max-clients 2</tt>, specifies that a maximum of two tunnels
may be active at one time. If you have only one or two users, there's
no good reason to allow more than one or two concurrent tunnels. In my
own testing, however, I've found that setting this all the way down to
1 can cause problems even if you have only one user, probably due to
how OpenVPN handles tunnel persistence (see
<tt  >keepalive</tt> above).
</p><p>
The next four settings are interrelated. <tt  >user</tt> and
<tt  >group</tt> specify the
names of an unprivileged user account and group
(<tt  >nobody</tt> and <tt  >nogroup</tt>,
respectively), for the OpenVPN server d&aelig;mon to demote itself to after
opening necessary tun/tap devices, reading its configuration file,
certificates and keys, and other root-only startup actions.
</p><p>
For this to work properly, you also need to set
<tt  >persist-key</tt> and
<tt  >persist-tun</tt>. <tt  >persist-key</tt> causes OpenVPN to keep key file contents
cached in memory across d&aelig;mon interruptions (like those caused by tunnels
being broken and re-established). <tt  >persist-tun</tt> causes OpenVPN to keep
any tun/tap devices that were opened on startup, open across the same
kinds of d&aelig;mon restarts.
</p><p>
With <tt  >user</tt> and <tt  >group</tt> set to unprivileged user and group, if you were
to skip declaring <tt  >persist-key</tt> or
<tt  >persist-tun</tt>, the OpenVPN d&aelig;mon
would lack the necessary privileges to re-read protected key files or
re-open the tun or tap device.
</p><p>
You could, of course, skip the user and group settings. Those
settings, however, lessen the impact of some unforeseen buffer-overflow
vulnerability. It can make the difference from an attacker gaining an
unprivileged shell and gaining a root shell. Unfortunately, you can't
assume that just because OpenVPN has had a good track record so far
with respect to lacking many significant security vulnerabilities,
that it never will have any!
</p><p>
The last three settings in Listing 1 concern logging.
<tt  >status</tt> specifies
a file to which OpenVPN will write d&aelig;mon status updates periodically,
regardless of actual activity. Unlike most log files, each time this
file is updated, OpenVPN will overwrite the previous message. This is
what the file /etc/openvpn/openvpn-status.log on my OpenVPN server
says right now:


<pre     class="programlisting">

</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, there's only one client currently connected
(<tt  >minion2</tt>),
with one corresponding route table entry.
</p><p>
Moving on back in Listing 1, <tt  >verb 3</tt> sets the overall logging-verbosity
level to 3 out of a possible range of 0 (no logging except major errors)
and 11 (the most verbose debugging output possible). The default value
is 1, but 3 is much more useful for getting things set up and working
properly, without presenting any particular danger of log files growing
too huge too quickly.
</p><p>
This is especially true with <tt  >mute 20</tt> set, which tells OpenVPN never
to log the same message (in a given event category) more than 20 times in
a row.
</p><p>
On my Ubuntu system, OpenVPN writes all its messages to /var/log/daemon
if the <tt  >openvpn</tt> command is executed with the
<tt  >--daemon</tt> flag, which
causes it to run as a background (d&aelig;mon) process. If you run
<tt  >openvpn</tt>
without <tt  >--daemon</tt>, it runs in the foreground and logs all messages to
the console or terminal window you started it in (tying up that console
in the process, but this is a very handy way to run OpenVPN during initial
setup and testing).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1352580.0x1443268"></a>
Running OpenVPN as a Server D&aelig;mon</h2></div></div><p>
Now that I've covered a sample server configuration file in depth,
let's fire up our OpenVPN d&aelig;mon in server mode! This, as you'll see,
is the easy part.
</p><p>
OpenVPN uses a single command, <tt  >openvpn</tt>, for everything. Precisely what any
given OpenVPN instance does depends on how you start it. As you've already
seen, some startup parameters, like <tt  >--show-ciphers</tt>, cause the openvpn
command to give certain information and then exit. Other parameters tell
it to remain active, listening for incoming client connections (<tt  >--mode
server</tt>) or attempting to establish and maintain a tunnel to some server,
as a client (<tt  >--mode client</tt>).
</p><p>
If you execute <tt  >openvpn</tt> with the <tt  >--config</tt> parameter followed by the
name of a configuration file, OpenVPN will start itself configured
with all parameters in that file. For example, you could create
a configuration file containing just the parameter
<tt  >show-ciphers</tt>
(parameters must start with a -- if specified in a command line,
but the -- is omitted for all parameters within configuration files).
</p><p>
More commonly, as with Listing 1, we use configuration files for
server-mode and client-mode startup. I mentioned that the
<tt  >server</tt>
helper directive expands into a list of other parameters; the first of
these is <tt  >mode server</tt>.
</p><p>
Thus, to start OpenVPN as a persistent server d&aelig;mon running the
configuration file /etc/openvpn/server.ovpn, shown in Listing 1,
use this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo openvpn --config ./server.ovpn
</pre>
</p><p>
Note the relative path for the file server.ovpn. If that file resides
in /etc/openvpn, you'd need to run the above command from within that
directory. Note also the use of sudo. On non-Ubuntu systems, you might
instead <tt  >su</tt> to root before running this command. Regardless, OpenVPN
must be run as root in order to read its server key file, to open the
tun device and so forth, even though as configured in Listing 1 it 
subsequently will demote itself to user nobody and group ID nogroup.
</p><p>
Did you notice I omitted the <tt  >--daemon</tt> flag on that command line? Again,
you can use that flag to tell OpenVPN to run in the background (like a
quiet, well-behaved d&aelig;mon) and log its messages to /var/log/daemon.log,
but you first may want to make sure everything's working properly.

Configuring the Client</h2></div></div><p>
At this point, I had hoped I'd be able to give you a detailed walk-through
of client configuration, but I'm out of space for now, so that will need
to wait until next time. But, I won't leave you completely hanging.
Listing 2 shows a sample client configuration file, client.ovpn, that
corresponds to Listing 1's server.ovpn file.

Much of this should be familiar. Other parts you can figure out via the
openvpn(8) man page. In the meantime, feel free to experiment. To run
OpenVPN in client mode on a client computer, use this command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo openvpn --config ./iwazaru.ovpn --daemon openvpn-client
</pre>
</p><p>
One parting tip for you experimenters: you'll need to disable or
reconfigure any local iptables (firewall) rules you've got running on
either your server or client systems. I'll discuss iptables considerations
in the next column in this series, and I'll continue where we left
off this time. Until then, be safe!
