VMware's own documentation apparently reported that some of its drivers
had been based on versions of Linux drivers that had to have been
under the GPL at the time VMware based its work on them. And, because
the drivers were statically linked with the ESX server, Gerhard felt
that this meant the entire ESX server was bound to the GPL and had to
be released under its provisions.
The truth of the matter isn't yet known, and accusations aren't proof.
But, it's good to take note of these potential issues as they come up.

2.6.36, 2.6.37 and other kernels that <span   class="bold"><b>Linus

<h2 class="title">Stupid afio Tricks</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #192, April 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I've already covered tar and all the wonderful ways to use it,
but it's not the only tool at your disposal. Another popular backup tool 
is afio. Depending on your distribution,
it already may be installed. On Ubuntu, for example, run the following to
install it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install afio
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you have a fairly powerful
tool at your disposal for archiving files and making backups.
</p><p>
By default, afio reads and writes the files being archived on standard
input and standard output. This means you can create a list of
files to archive with another program, like find, and pipe it to afio to do
the actual archive. Once you have your list of files, you can apply five basic
commands to those files:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >-o</tt> &mdash; create an archive.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-i</tt> &mdash; install (or unpack) an archive.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-t</tt> &mdash; test (or list) the files stored in an
archive.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-r</tt> &mdash; verify the files stored in an archive
against the filesystem.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-p</tt> &mdash; copy the files to a given directory
location.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If you want to create a simple archive of all of your C source code files,
execute:

<pre     class="programlisting">
find . -name *.c -print | afio -o -Z source_code
</pre>
</p><p>
When you want to extract these files again, execute:

<pre     class="programlisting">
afio -i -Z source_code
</pre>
</p><p>
When you run afio as a regular user, all file paths are stored with no
leading /. This means when you unpack an archive, it unpacks in
the current directory. The idea is to avoid 
overwriting system files accidentally. To keep the leading /, use the
command-line option <tt  >-x</tt>. Running afio as the
superuser reverses this behavior&mdash;any leading / is maintained, and you need to use
the command-line option <tt  >-X</tt> to get the usual behavior
of stripping the leading
/.
</p><p>
If space is at a premium, afio also can compress your archive, just like
tar, with the <tt  >-Z</tt> command-line option. There is one
very big difference, however. When you compress a tar archive, the entire
archive file is compressed. This means if one part of the file is
corrupted, you potentially could lose all the files in the
archive. When you compress an afio archive, the archived files actually
are compressed individually. So if one file becomes corrupted, by
whatever means, you won't lose any of the other files in the
archive. 
</p><p>
When you compress an archive, afio uses gzip by default. You
can tell gzip what compression factor to use with the <tt  >-G
<i>num</i></tt> command-line option, where
<tt  ><i>num</i></tt> is the amount of compression
gzip will apply to the
archived files. This is a number between 0 (for no compression) and 9 (for
maximum compression), with a default of 6. 
</p><p>
You may need to balance how much
CPU and how much IO time is being used during the compression phase. If so,
you can limit when compression is to be used. The command-line
option <tt  >-T <i>threshold</i></tt> tells afio not to try
compressing a file unless it
is at least <tt  ><i>threshold</i></tt> bytes in
size. The default setting is <tt  >-T 0k</tt>, so
afio tries to compress all files, no matter how small. At the other end of
the spectrum, you may want to limit how large a file can be before afio
tries to compress it. You can do that with the command-line option
<tt  >-2
<i>max</i></tt>, where max is the maximum file size. The
default in this case is <tt  >-2
200m</tt>, so afio won't try to compress files larger than 200MB.
</p><p>
What if you don't want to use gzip as your compression method? You can
change this by using the command-line option <tt  >-P
<i>progname</i></tt>, where
<tt  ><i>progname</i></tt>
is the name of the executable to use to do the compression. 
</p><p>
If you need to
hand options in to this alternate program, use the 
<tt  >-Q opt</tt> option. You need to use separate
<tt  >-Q</tt> options for each option you want to
hand in to the alternate program. Because afio simply executes this
alternate program, you can run anything at this stage, such as
an encryption program, allowing you to encrypt your archive. To encrypt
your archive using PGP, execute:


<pre     class="programlisting">
export PGPPASSFD=3
find . -name *.c -print | afio -ovz -Z -U -P 
 &#8618;pgp -Q -fc -Q +verbose=0 -3 3 archive 3&lt;passphrasefile
</pre>
</p><p>
This runs PGP on all files in the archive as they are added.
</p><p>
The last afio trick is having the ability to
interact with archives on external systems in a similar manner as you would with tar.
The format looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[user@]host[%rsh][=afio]:file
</pre>
</p><p>
The option <tt  >user@</tt> is the user name you would use to access the external
system. The default communications mechanism is rsh, but you can change
that to ssh with the option <tt  >%ssh</tt>. You can define the command to use
on the external system with the option <tt  >=afio</tt>. You can use this if the
executable is named something else or in an odd location. So, if you
want to archive all your source code files onto an external server
over ssh, you could execute:


<pre     class="programlisting">
find . -name *.c -print | afio -o -Z user@server%ssh:archive
</pre>
</p><p>
Using afio, go forth and ensure that you have proper backups of
all of your important information.

<h2 class="title">Chumby, the Next Generation</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #192, April 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
If you're unfamiliar with the Chumby, you might want to go back to the May 2008
issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>. Daniel Bartholomew showed us all about the
cuddly little gadget and explained why we might want one of our very own.
The folks over at <a href="http://www.chumby.com" target="_self">www.chumby.com</a> still sell the original Chumby device, but
they've come out with a new model, the Chumby One. I'm rather fond
of the numbering scheme they chose, because that would mean the original
Chumby is number zero. If the next model is the Chumby 10, they will
get extra geek points!

</p><p>
How does the new revision stack up? Quite frankly, it's great. Although it
may have lost the rounded edges and squishy case, the Chumby One adds
some welcome features:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A dedicated volume knob, for quick-and-simple volume control.
</p></li><li><p>
Rechargeable battery for Chumby uninterrupted mobility (battery not
included).
</p></li><li><p>
FM radio.
</p></li><li><p>
Beefed-up CPU (454MHz).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I'll admit I always thought a Chumby would be more of a novelty than
a useful gadget; however, I was pleasantly surprised to see its rotating
&ldquo;widget&rdquo;
display happily keeps me informed and entertained during my workday.
It can stream Pandora (and other) music in the background, display
LOLcats and show you the weather. At night, it makes an extremely useful
clock radio. Because it has a rechargeable battery, toting it around isn't
a problem. If you've been tempted to pick up a Chumby, but were concerned
it would just collect dust, you might be pleasantly surprised!

<h2 class="title">Talking on Cell Phones Is So 2009</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #192, April 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Like many families, the Powers' house has a &ldquo;family plan&rdquo; for our
cell service. A year ago, when we estimated the minutes we'd need on a
shared plan, 1,400 per month seemed like a good amount. Six months into
our contract, we had more than 6,000 rollover minutes (yes, we use AT&amp;T).
To compensate, and save some money, we lowered our plan to 700 shared
minutes. This Christmas, when our oldest daughter got a cell phone, we
discovered we had several thousand <span   class="emphasis"><em>new</em></span> rollover
minutes, even with the
reduced plan!

</p><p>
Perhaps data-only cell phones will be here sooner than later.
Certainly with things like Google Voice, Skype, Gizmo5 and any number
of other VoIP services, seamless transition from Wi-Fi to 3G makes sense.
As long as we can send text messages, pictures of cats and answer the
occasional phone call via VoIP, why do we need traditional voice services?
As someone who works in a building with no cell-phone coverage, but plenty
of Wi-Fi bandwidth, I certainly would welcome accessibility from indoors.
How about you? Would you take a cell phone with a zero-minute plan?

Windows users expect an installer program when they get new software.
But, creating a full-featured installer could end up taking more time than
your application did.
Fortunately though, creating installers is largely an automated task
on Windows these days, as there are numerous tools to assist you
in creating a GUI installer for your application.
One of them is the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS).
NSIS was developed by Nullsoft, the developers of the Winamp media player.
NSIS is free and open-source software.
</p><p>
NSIS installers are built from installer scripts.
These scripts control the actions of the installer when it is run.
The scripts allow the developer to create sophisticated installers
that can deal with complex installation tasks, such as handling
upgrades differently based on the already-installed version.
NSIS includes a plugin system that allows the installer to
be customized to include custom steps and interfaces.
Plugins can be written in languages that can produce a Windows DLL.
</p><p>
Once the installer scripts are ready, they are compiled with
the NSIS compiler, and an installation program is created.
One of the nice features of NSIS is that the script compiler can be
built and run on any POSIX-compliant platform (such as Linux, BSD and UNIX),
allowing you to build your installer on a system you actually like using.
</p><p>
NSIS is actively maintained, well documented, and it
runs on all modern versions of Windows (from Windows 95 on).
The latest release at the time of this writing is NSIS version 2.46.

Although my intent is not to start the next GNOME/KDE-level war, it seems
there must be a happy medium between total desktop insecurity and total
desktop unusability. Linux offers so many ways to secure data that
it's important to realize it's okay for folks to have different needs
and desires. Sure, there are some basic security measures we all should
take&mdash;things like:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Don't write your password on a sticky note fastened to your monitor.
</p></li><li><p>
Don't leave your e-mail account logged in on a public computer.
</p></li><li><p>
Keep your system updated.
</p></li><li><p>
Do have a password.
</p></li><li><p>
Don't use &ldquo;password&rdquo; as your password.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Apart from that, and I'm sure a few other common-sense practices,
security is different for different users and
different situations. Take the password scenario&mdash;it's very good to
have a complex password. But, if your screensaver kicks on every three minutes
of inactivity and requires you to type that complex password,
your security measures have taken you hostage.
</p><p>
Now before I get hate mail (you know who you are, you've likely already
started an e-mail to me), let me assure you, I'm not advocating insecure
computer practices. What I am advocating is freedom. If I want my
laptop to auto-log in, and not lock the screen with the screensaver, as
long as it's only my data being exposed, it should be okay. Sadly,
when it comes to freedom, we need to let people have the freedom to do
dumb things too. And now if you'll excuse me, I need to try to remember
my luggage combination, &ldquo;1, 2, 3, 4, 5...&rdquo;.

<span   class="bold"><b>AB:</b></span> Do you remember the very first time when you heard about Linux
and your first experience with it?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> I don't remember when I first heard about Linux. I think it was
probably around 1996. I do remember when I first heard about Web
browsers&mdash;I said it sounded like a waste of time. I said the same thing about
Twitter. Now I use them both every day and find them very useful.
</p><p>
I actually was more interested in GNOME than Linux. I worked in the HP-UX
lab and was looking at seeing whether we could put GNOME on HP-UX. This
was an intentional move from CDE to a more-featured GNOME. Later, I helped
start the Linux lab at HP.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SS:</b></span> My boyfriend Jamey was the first one to introduce me to Linux. We were
both university students at the time. I was taking a C programming class,
and we had to compile our work with gcc on a Linux system. There were
Linux computers on campus, but I wanted to work on my projects from
home. I tried using the instructor's directions for SSHing into a box,
but the SSH client I was using didn't handle scroll back properly. My
boyfriend told me I could install Cygwin on Windows and walked me
though installing it. I finally got tired of Cygwin, and he convinced
me to dual-boot my computer with Debian Linux.
</p><p>
I do remember asking Jamey a lot of questions and eventually trying to
Google for answers in order to learn things independently.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
VA:</b></span> My first experience with Linux was a long time ago! Around 1996,
my university started installing Slackware on most of the fast new
i386 PCs in the computer lab. I really liked Linux, in part because
our previous UNIX machines were Sun pizza boxes running SunOS 4.1.4,
and the i386 blew them out of the water. They also didn't have that
distinctive annoying hard-disk whine that the Sun boxes had. I used
Linux to read e-mail, write programs and browse the Web. I spent a lot
of time customizing my window manager.

<span   class="bold"><b>AB:</b></span> Do you agree with the statement that
universities (scientific
institutions) are the best places to be a cradle for technology, like Linux,
and eventually promoters of it?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> I do remember being very jealous of today's college students who can
carry Linux on a laptop back to their dorm rooms. I had to walk across
campus to use the Solaris systems we learned on, and nobody could afford
one of their own.
</p><p>
I do think universities are a good place to promote and encourage
free software, including Linux. Students look for low cost and good
solutions. They then take what they learn to their workplaces.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SS:</b></span> I believe that universities and colleges are a good place to
introduce people to Linux <span   class="emphasis"><em>development</em></span>, but you have to start much
younger to introduce people to <span   class="emphasis"><em>using</em></span> Linux. I would love to see
programs to get middle-school-aged girls into using Linux and programming
small projects or even just installing Linux on older boxes. See
<a href="http://creativity-online.com/news/little-girls-get-their-hands-on-arduino/136751" target="_self">creativity-online.com/news/little-girls-get-their-hands-on-arduino/136751</a>

</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>VA:</b></span> What I do think is that having
universities involved in open-source
development is excellent for their computer science students' job
prospects, and it increases open-source development significantly. In my
case, I learned how to develop Linux and open source at my university,
New Mexico Tech. I graduated from the university already knowing how to
download open-source code, compile it and modify it. Our computer
science department as a whole developed some significant portions of
the Linux kernel. Working with open source was a key part of my class
work every semester, and I can't think of any other way than university
support for open source to get four years of experience working on open
source before graduating.
</p><p>
What is shocking to me is how seldom university computer science programs
take advantage of this opportunity to teach and train students at the
same time. I can't believe how often professors teach operating systems
with a &ldquo;teaching OS&rdquo; instead of Linux or use some proprietary IDE that
abstracts away the practical side of programming. As far as I can tell,
it is all about the personal preferences of individual professors, and
it is a matter of luck whether you get a professor who uses open source.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>AB:</b></span>
Can women bring an inspiring atmosphere that positively influences
productivity in the workplace? 
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
SP:</b></span> I think where you work and the atmosphere around you contributes
greatly to how happy you are and then to how productive you are. I
wouldn't say that only women bring this atmosphere, but rather
they bring that diversity in general.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AB:</b></span> How often do you hear men saying something like:
&ldquo;Wow, you're familiar with Linux! That's great!&rdquo;?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SS:</b></span> Are you asking me if males find it surprising that I use Linux? I
think males are more surprised when I'm not in a techie group.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
SP:</b></span> Hmm. I'm much more likely to get &ldquo;GNOME, Linux, what's
that?&rdquo; I
used to get &ldquo;you don't look like a computer person!&rdquo; I hated that
one&mdash;especially when they told me that was a compliment.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AB:</b></span> Do you think this reaction was caused
by a computer industry stereotype&mdash;only by men and for men?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> Absolutely it was caused by a
stereotype. And, instead of feeling
like a compliment it felt like they were limiting me.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AB:</b></span> In your opinion, does the Linux community suffer from a lack of
women-contributors?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>VA:</b></span> I have been involved in the Linux community at one level or another
for about ten years now and have thought a lot about why women stay
away from and/or leave Linux development. One thing I am sure about is
that the Linux community suffers from a leak of people who don't want
to work in an incredibly hostile environment. Leaving aside arguments
about genetically based differences in male and female personalities, men
are trained and encouraged to hold their own in aggressive, adversarial and
argumentative situations, and women are discouraged from the same. (I was
personally trained to be more assertive and challenging than most women,
but it's still not a pleasant experience, to say the least.)
</p><p>
In the end, the Linux development culture is heavily biased toward people
who thrive on conflict. A widely held belief is that the adversarial
culture results in higher-quality software, but that sounds a little
bit like rationalization to me.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
AB:</b></span> How do we attract more women to contribute?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SS:</b></span> So many people have opinions on this.
Most of them boil down to this:
don't be a jerk. Stop allowing sexist/racist comments on IRC, e-mail
or in conference presentations. Criticize the code, not the person. Women
really want to get their first submissions &ldquo;right&rdquo; the first time, and
are discouraged when they don't know everything. I've found it was really
good to have a mentor I could trust with my emotions to review code before
sending it to a public mailing list. Perhaps a group of women could step
up to review code or be mentors for new developers. It's a difficult
problem to solve, and I don't think there is one big solution to this.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
SP:</b></span> I think it's best solved by
encouraging more women to join through mentors, programs directed at
women and general awareness and encouragement in the forums where the
community congregates. I think the Free and Open Source community would
benefit from women in the community&mdash;not only would it add diversity
but also twice as many developers! Women would benefit from having more
career options&mdash;a really fun and rewarding one.
